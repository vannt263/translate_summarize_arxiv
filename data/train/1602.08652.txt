    "the dynamics for these oscillators are related to each other by `` time scaling '' .",
    "in fact , the _ four_-dimensional descriptions of the two models detailed trajectories are precisely identical ! but of the two only nos s oscillator problem exhibits the stiffness which is the focus of the present work .",
    "the nos oscillator was designed to model a harmonic oscillator at thermal equilibrium , characterized by a temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics nos developed has both regular [ stable to small perturbations ] and chaotic [ unstable to perturbations ] solutions , coexisting in a constant - energy three - dimensional volume within a four - dimensional phase space . within that space",
    "there are infinitely - many regular solutions ( concentric tori and stable periodic orbits ) in addition to a single chaotic sea which stretches to infinity and occupies about six percent of the stationary measure defined by liouville s theorem .",
    "quite remarkably that stationary measure has a simple analytic form .",
    "it is a smooth three - dimensional gaussian distribution . though the simpler regular stable tori and the periodic orbits they enclose are relatively easy to solve , motion in nos s version of the chaotic sea is sufficiently stiff to require the special solution methods we describe in what follows .",

    "going back to alder and wainwright s pioneering work of the middle 1950s@xcite , with thousands or millions of degrees of freedom , it is usual to integrate up to the moment of the next collision , change the momenta of the colliding particles _ at _ the collision , and then continue on until the next collision .",
    "these `` event - driven '' simulations are another example of the need for two or more solution strategies for the underlying differential equations .      where chaos is concerned , which is typical of `` interesting '' problems , lyapunov instability is most easily quantified by following two neighboring trajectories .",

    "the distance between the two trajectories can be rescaled . either way the original separation length is recovered at the end of each timestep .",
    "the logarithm of the scale factor required to do this is simply related to the local lyapunov exponent .",
    "these two approaches provide the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath111 , the mean separation rate over a long simulation , @xmath112 .",
    "the lagrange multiplier approach can also be applied to a linearized version of the equations at the expense of additional algebra .",
    "all three of these techniques are useful tools which can benefit from adaptive integration@xcite .",
    "chaotic systems will always be a challenge .",
    "joseph ford@xcite emphasized that numerical methods are unable to follow any chaotic trajectory accurately for very long .",

    "it is evident that _ no _ numerical methods are capable of precise solutions of such problems .",
    "adaptive integrators are a useful tool for producing `` reasonable '' chaotic trajectories , inaccurate though they may be .      because all three oscillator models , [ nos , nos - hoover # 1 , and nos - hoover # 2 , or @xmath113 and @xmath114 ] share common trajectories , their travel times and their lyapunov exponents",

    "it is evident that both dynamics share the _ same _ reference trajectory .",
    "it might then appear that the neighboring satellite trajectory determining @xmath102 would be the same for both dynamics too .",

    "the relation linking all the rates leads directly to the useful relations : @xmath124    as an example , illustrated in * figure 9 * , consider the simplest stable periodic orbit , with initial values @xmath125 , traced out in times of @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the ratios of the two times are related to the mean values of @xmath128 averaged over the orbit : @xmath129 @xmath130    an interesting feature of the oscillator problems is that _ the largest lyapunov exponent is independent of temperature_. see the lefthand side of * figure 4*. the righthand side _ does _ show temperature dependence .",
    "fluctuation _ of the exponents ( hardly distinguishable from @xmath131 ) increases with temperature for temperatures greater than 2 .",
    "we can _ prove _ the temperature independence shown in * figure 4*. if we consider the _ temperature - dependent _ nos - hoover # 2 equations and introduce new variables , @xmath132 the temperature - independent result shows that the largest lyapunov exponent ( but not its fluctuation ) is indeed temperature independent ( this is because a _ linear _ change of scale leaves the time - averaged _ logarithmic _ growth rate unchanged ) : @xmath133    in section iib we saw that the temperature - dependent @xmath134 nos - hoover equations provide a stationary solution from liouville s theorem : @xmath135 @xmath136/\\tau^2 \\ , \\ ] ] just as in the simpler case with @xmath0 and @xmath40 equal to unity we can find a corresponding @xmath32 : @xmath137    we remarked on the disparity of the nos and nos - hoover lyapunov exponents .",
    "the nos oscillator exponent is @xmath138 while the two nos - hoover exponents are smaller , @xmath139 .",
    "* figure 7 * illustrated , on two very different scales , a typical excursion of the local lyapunov exponent in nos s stiff case . on the scale of the figure at the left the variation looks _ singular _ , but it is actually _ smooth _ when adaptive integration is used to control the scale of the smallest timestep , which is @xmath140 . * figure 8 * shows similar data for the nos - hoover version of the same problem . in that case",
    "no special precautions need be taken .",
    "a fixed timestep of 0.001 is perfectly adequate for accurate estimates of the local lyapunov exponent .      in bringing this discussion of adaptive integrators to a close",
    "let us mention that there is a significant variation in the _ topology of _ the chaotic and regular solutions for our oscillator models where the thermostating is `` fast '' : @xmath141 \\longrightarrow \\dot \\zeta = [ \\ p^2 - 1 \\ ] /\\tau^2\\ ] ] [ when the response time @xmath40 is small ] .",
    "in particular , fast thermostating generates infinite numbers of intricately _ knotted trajectories _",
    ", many of which are described in references 18 and 19 .",
    "these simple oscillator models , with quadratic ordinary differential equations ( and their nonequilibrium fractal relatives , where temperature is a function of the coordinates ) , can generate _ interlinked rings _ in phase space .",
    "an example is described in our own very recent work with puneet patra@xcite .",
    "these models chaotic trajectories , with their knots , and interlinked rings could easily fill an entertaining and profusely - illustrated book on the subject .",
