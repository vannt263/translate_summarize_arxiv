    ", one distinguishes excitations to low - lying unoccupied states ( so - called prepeaks ) , excitations to states close to the ionization threshold ( x - ray absorption near - edge structure , xanes ) , and excitations to continuum states ( extended x - ray absorption fine structure , exafs ) . on the other hand , x - ray emission spectroscopy ( xes ) considers the emission of x - ray radiation after the formation of a core hole .    of particular interest",
    "are the applications of these techniques to study catalytic mechanisms _ in situ _",
    "( for examples , see , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and to investigate biological or biomimetic systems containing transition metal centers ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "usually , xas and xes are used as fingerprint techniques in such studies to identify the oxidation state , spin state , and local coordination environment of a metal center .",
    "this requires either the comparison with spectra measured for model compounds or with theoretical predictions . to be able to extract additional information from x - ray spectroscopic measurements ,",
    "the development of theoretical methods for the calculation of x - ray spectra is essential @xcite .    for exafs spectra ,",
    "approaches based on scattering theory are well established and make it possible to extract structural parameters such as distances and coordination numbers @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for describing prepeaks and the xanes region in xas spectroscopy and for predicting xes spectra , quantum - chemical approaches are usually required . to this end , a wide range of quantum - chemical methods have been developed for describing excitations from core orbitals ( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs  @xcite ) .",
    "widely used are the static - exchange approximation ( stex ) @xcite , approaches based on transition potential density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , and time - dependent density - functional theory ( td - dft ) @xcite . within td - dft ,",
    "core excitations are accessible by restricting the space of occupied  virtual orbital excitations ( restricted - channel approximation ) @xcite , by selectively targeting excitations within a specific energy window @xcite , by using a complex polarization propagator @xcite , or with real - time td - dft methods @xcite .",
    "recently , coupled - cluster response theory has also been extended to x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .    by combining x - ray spectroscopy with quantum - chemical calculations ,",
    "it becomes possible to extract information on the electronic structure of molecular systems .",
    "for instance , the analysis of the prepeak intensities in ligand k - edge xas spectra of transition metal complexes ( i.e. , excitations from the ligand @xmath0 to metal @xmath1 orbitals ) provides insights into the covalent contributions to metal  ligand bonding @xcite .",
    "another example is metal k - edge xas , probing excitations from metal @xmath0 to @xmath1 orbitals , which can be used to assign coordination numbers @xcite and to probe details of the metal ",
    "ligand bonding mechanisms @xcite .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated that the prepeaks in fe k - edge xas spectra of ferrocene derivatives are sensitive to subtle differences in the electronic structure at the iron atom , which are induced by substituents at the cyclopentadienyl rings , i.e. , beyond the first coordination shell of the metal center @xcite .",
    "such studies are facilitated by high - energy resolution fluorescence detection ( herfd ) techniques , which can resolve the prepeaks with a much higher resolution than conventional xas measurements @xcite .",
    "however , beside the challenges posed by the accurate quantum - chemical prediction of the absolute or relative energies of core excitations , for the prepeaks in k - edge xas spectra , theoretical x - ray spectroscopy faces an additional problem . for the calculation of xas intensities for hard x - rays , the well - known dipole approximation , in which the oscillator strengths are proportional to the square of the electric - dipole transition moments is not sufficient .",
    "the dipole approximation is based on the assumption that the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation is large compared to the size of the core orbital . for the high - energy radiation used in hard x - ray spectroscopy , this is not the case anymore .",
    "this is particularly important for the prepeaks in metal k - edge xas spectra of transition metal complexes , which are usually dipole forbidden or have a very low dipole intensity due to symmetry .",
    "thus , the intensity of these prepeaks is due to contributions that are not included in the dipole approximation @xcite .",
    "currently , contributions to xas or xes intensities beyond the dipole approximation , so - called quadrupole intensities , are calculated by including additional contributions that are proportional to the squares of the electric - quadrupole and the magnetic - dipole transition moments @xcite . however , these additional contributions depend on the choice of the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "this situation is not satisfactory , as a physical observable should be origin independent . to rectify this , neese and coworkers suggested to choose the origin differently for each excitation such that these additional contributions are minimized @xcite .",
    "usually , this is equivalent to placing the origin on the atom at which the excitation takes place .",
    "however , in cases where the dipole intensities are very small compared to the quadrupole intensities , this scheme sometimes places the origin far away from the excited core orbital @xcite , which seems unphysical and affects the resulting intensities significantly .",
    "moreover , the scheme will also fail for excitations from core orbitals that are delocalized over different atomic centers , a situation which occurs for ligand - edge xas spectra or for metal k - edge spectra in polynuclear transition metal clusters .",
    "thus , a theoretical framework for the origin - independent calculation of quadrupole intensities in x - ray spectroscopy would be desirable . here",
    ", we show that such a formulation can be obtained if all contributions to the oscillator strengths that are of the same order in the wave vector are included consistently .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "the theory is presented in section  [ sec : theory ] . after introducing the theoretical framework in sections  [ sec : radiation ] and  [ sec : qm ]",
    ", we revisit the multipole expansion of the transition moments in section  [ sec : multipole ] .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ sec : osc - strengths ] this expansion is applied for the calculation of the oscillator strengths and we demonstrate that these become origin - independent if all terms that are of the same order are included consistently . the final equations for the isotropically averaged quadrupole intensities are then derived in section  [ sec : average ] .",
    "this is followed by a description of our implementation of the resulting formalism within td - dft in section  [ sec : compdet ] , before we illustrate its usefulness for two test cases in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally a summary and concluding remarks are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ]",
    "for the theoretical description of spectroscopic processes , quantum chemistry commonly employs a semi - classical theory . in this framework , the molecules are described with ( nonrelativistic ) quantum - mechanics , whereas the electromagnetic radiation is treated classically ( for a discussion , see also ref .",
    "this theoretical framework is also appropriate for absorption and emission processes in x - ray spectroscopy . here",
    ", we will focus on the case of absorption , but the results can be transferred to other types of experiments .      within the coulomb gauge ( i.e. , if one chooses the vector potential such that @xmath2 ) , a monochromatic , linearly - polarized electromagnetic wave is defined by the scalar and vector potentials @xcite , @xmath3 where the wave vector @xmath4 points in the direction of propagation and its magnitude is related to the wavelength by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",

    "finally , one usually introduces the dimensionless oscillator strengths , @xmath47 these are defined as transition rates relative to a harmonic oscillator model @xcite , which fixes the prefactor connecting the absorption cross section and the oscillator strengths .      calculating the oscillator strengths via the matrix elements of eq .   would in principle be possible , but is cumbersome and in general not feasible .",
    "the required integrals are difficult to compute analytically ( for a possible approach , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and because of its dependence on the wave vector @xmath4 , the operator in @xmath48 is different for each excitation .",
    "therefore , one usually performs a multipole expansion . the starting point for",
    "this expansion is a development of the exponential in a taylor series , @xmath49 this is substituted into eq .   and",
    ", subsequently , one collects the terms of different orders in the wave vector @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath50 in the following , we will consider terms up to second order in @xmath4 . here ,",
    "@xmath51 acts as the expansion parameter , and we note that for larger wavelengths @xmath15 , the convergence of the taylor expansion will be faster . for typical molecules and wavelengths in the ultraviolet or visible range , the wavelength is large compared to the molecular size , and it is sufficient to include only the first ( zeroth - order ) term in this expansion .",
    "this corresponds to assuming that the oscillating electric field is constant over the whole molecule .",
    "however , for the short wavelengths used in hard x - ray spectroscopy this approximation is not adequate and higher - order terms need to be included .      in zeroth order in the wave vector @xmath4 , we have @xmath52 where we have introduced the electric - dipole moment operator in the velocity representation @xmath53    by using the relations given in appendix [ app : comm ] , the matrix elements of the electric - dipole moment operator in the velocity representation can be related to those in the conventional length representation as @xmath54 where we introduced the electric - dipole moment operator in the length representation @xmath55    thus , for the zeroth - order contribution , we arrive at @xmath56      in the first order in @xmath4 , we find @xmath57 the matrix elements in the first term can be split into one term that is symmetric and one that is antisymmetric with respect to interchanging the wave vector @xmath4 and the polarization vector @xmath58 via @xmath59    from the symmetric first term and using einstein s convention of implicit summation over repeated greek indices , which we use to label the cartesian components @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , we obtain @xmath63 where we introduced the electric - quadrupole moment operator in the velocity representation @xmath64    again , with the help of the relations given in appendix [ app : comm ] , the matrix elements in the velocity representation can be related to those in the conventional length representation , and one arrives at @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the operator of the electric - quadrupole moment in the length representation .",

    "<S> for electronic excitations in the ultraviolet and visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum , the intensities are usually calculated within the dipole approximation , which assumes that the oscillating electric field is constant over the length scale of the transition . for the short wavelengths used in hard x - ray spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> , the dipole approximation may not be adequate . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for metal k - edge x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) , it becomes necessary to include higher - order contributions . in quantum - chemical approaches to x - ray spectroscopy , these so - called quadrupole intensities </S>",
    "<S> have so far been calculated by including contributions depending on the square of the electric - quadrupole and magnetic - dipole transition moments . </S>",
    "<S> however , the resulting quadrupole intensities depend on the choice of the origin of the coordinate system . here , we show that for obtaining an origin - independent theory , one has to include all contributions that are of the same order in the wave vector consistently . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to two additional contributions depending on products of the electric - dipole andelectric - octupole and of the electric - dipole and magnetic - quadrupole transition moments , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have implemented such an origin - independent calculation of quadrupole intensities in xas within time - dependent density - functional theory , and demonstrate its usefulness for the calculation of metal and ligand k - edge xas spectra of transition metal complexes .     </S>",
