    "quantum statistical physics provides the conceptual and computational framework for the treatment of interacting many - body systems in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath .",
    "it describes a great variety of systems and phenomena over a wide range of scales , thus covering practically all areas of physics , from cosmology to particle physics , with an extensive number of examples in condensed matter .",
    "its broad spectrum of applications includes special relativistic systems .",
    "for those , the quantum statistical treatment is known as finite - temperature field theory @xcite , which is synonymous to quantum statistical field theory .",
    "in fact , just as quantum statistical mechanics adds stochastic probabilities to the quantum probabilities of quantum mechanics , finite temperature field theory does likewise with respect to quantum field theory , the natural combination of special relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "quantum statistical physics can be formulated in the language of euclidean ( imaginary - time ) functional integrals , quite natural for finite - temperature field theories , but also applicable in nonrelativistic contexts , since quantum mechanics can be viewed as a field theory in zero spatial dimensions .",
    "functional integrals thus furnish a powerful unifying formalism to compute correlations .",
    "indeed , the formalism expresses the partition function of a given system as a generating functional of euclidean green functions ( correlations ) , similarly to zero - temperature field theory , but with the time direction made compact , and specific boundary conditions that constrain the domain of field configurations in the functional integral .    in order to best",
    "exploit the unifying aspect of the formalism , we propose to view the partition function as an integral of the diagonal density matrix element of the theory .",
    "the integral is performed over the stochastic variable which characterizes the representation of the matrix element ( position representation for quantum mechanics , field representation for second quantized quantum mechanics or field theory ) .",
    "the density matrix is just the boltzmann operator , whose hamiltonian operator may either come from ( second quantized ) quantum mechanics or from field theory .",
    "the density matrix element may be written as a functional integral in euclidean time @xmath0 which starts from a given configuration ( a point in quantum mechanics , a field configuration in field theory ) at @xmath1 , and returns to that same configuration at @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , there is a sum to be performed over configurations which coincide at the endpoints of the euclidean time interval .",
    "those boundary configurations are identified as the stochastic variable of the remaining integral .",
    "furthermore , it will be shown that they are zero modes of a modified matsubara series .",
    "the theory of the zero modes is the effective stochastic theory obtained from the original hamiltonian .",
    "this density matrix method for deriving an effective stochastic problem was already used in @xcite , where it led to the construction of dimensionally reduced effective actions . likewise , in ref .",
    "@xcite we used the density matrix method , and a semiclassical approximation , to investigate the thermodynamics of scalar fields . in the latter reference , the boundary configuration of the field ( written as a constant plus gaussian fluctuations ) played a very nontrivial role in the semiclassical formulation for the partition function of scalar fields .",
    "our prior uses of the method drew upon generalizations of a thermal semiclassical treatment previously developed and applied to quantum statistical mechanics , which produced excellent results for the ground state energy and the specific heat of the anharmonic ( quartic ) oscillator @xcite . in those prior uses ,",
    "however , the connection with the stochastic variable was indirect , through classical solutions of equations of motion .",
    "now , we have opted instead for a direct connection with the stochastic variable , to be identified with a zero mode , because we believe this is physically relevant to the discussion of infrared problems in several applications of quantum statistical physics .    in the context of finite - temperature field theory , for instance",
    ", it is known that a naive implementation of perturbation theory for the calculation of feynman diagrams is ill - defined in the presence of massless bosons .",
    "this is due to the appearance of severe infrared divergences , brought about by the vanishing bosonic matsubara mode in thermal propagators .",
    "the divergences plague the entire series , making it essentially meaningless @xcite .    as a result ,",
    "one is forced to resort to resummation techniques that reorganize the perturbative series , and resum certain classes of diagrams , in order to extract sensible results .",
    "there are several ways of performing resummations , and rewriting the degrees of freedom more efficiently in terms of quasiparticles ; we refer the reader to the reviews @xcite , and to ref .",
    "@xcite , for a discussion and a list of specific references .",
    "all such techniques are designed to partially tame the infrared divergences , creating a non - zero domain of validity for weak - coupling expansions .",
    "nevertheless , the zero - mode problem remains , and the region of validity of resummed perturbation treatments can not be indefinitely enlarged .",
    "the infrared problems of finite temperature field theory resemble those encountered in the functional integral treatment of various condensed matter systems @xcite , where they are connected to collective excitations .",
    "this suggests that one should explore the unifying feature of the formalism , which is its statistical nature , to profit from parallel physical interpretations and insights .",
    "this is yet another reason for resorting to the density matrix formulation .    in the present article",
    ", we resume the study of quantum statistical mechanics , viewed as an exercise in zero - dimensional finite - temperature field theory .",
    "our objective is to show that boundary configurations are the zero - mode stochastic variables of the effective statistical theory , and to compute that theory in various approximate schemes .",
    "although we restrict our analysis to quantum mechanical examples , this should be regarded as a preliminary to the field theory case .",
    "we compute the partition function of an interacting one - dimensional quantum mechanical system at finite temperature from a path - integral representation for the density matrix .",
    "the method of calculation that we propose provides an alternative to the usual sum over periodic trajectories : it sums over paths with coincident endpoints , and includes the contribution of non - vanishing boundary terms .",
    "indeed , an appropriately modified expansion into matsubara modes provides a natural separation of the zero - mode physics , which is connected to the infrared problems in thermal field theory and elsewhere , and relates the zero mode to the boundary value of the quantum - mechanical coordinate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the proposed modified series expansion in matsubara frequencies , and make a detailed comparison of our density matrix procedure with the standard one , for clarity ; in section iii , we relate the boundary value of the quantum - mechanical coordinate ( the stochastic variable ) to the zero mode ; in section iv , we compute several thermodynamic quantities for the quadratic and the quartic potentials , and compare our results to the semiclassical findings of @xcite , and to some exact results ; section v contains our conclusions and outlook .",

    "being periodic , the corresponding series has a periodic derivative , so that the quantity is put to zero . that was used to eliminate the boundary term in eq .",
    "however , we see from that @xmath46 , otherwise one would obtain an incorrect result for @xmath3 .",
    "the second method of calculation sums over paths which have coincident endpoints , and thus includes paths that are _ not _ periodic .",
    "it is easy to realize that we introduce an error in the value of the action of any non - periodic path @xmath15 by evaluating the action of the associate matsubara series as given by eq . .",
    "the reason is that the usual matsubara expansion is not suitable to handle boundary terms involving the derivative of @xmath15 at @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we stress that , as long as the only condition over paths in the path integral is to have coincident values at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , non - periodicity _ is _ allowed .",

    "notice that @xmath53 .",
    "the odd character of the extension implies that @xmath54 has a series of sines : @xmath55 the notation with a dot is a reminder that the r.h.s .",
    "of eq . is a fourier approximation of the l.h.s .",
    "the desired restriction to @xmath56 $ ] is : @xmath57 where @xmath58 the series does not impose conditions on the derivative of @xmath15 .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that evaluating the euclidean action @xmath9 with the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "one obtains exactly @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "in particular , we have for the classical solution : @xmath60 so that the quantity @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 as implied by eq . .",
    "obviously , the series defined by eq . does not correspond to the most general trajectory in @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , that series imposes a serious restriction on the second derivative of @xmath15 , by forcing it to vanish at @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however , at least for the calculation of usual action functionals , the boundary terms do not involve second derivatives and the aforementioned restriction is actually unimportant .",
    "the first remarkable property of the decomposition is that the boundary value @xmath14 is the zero , static component of @xmath15 which , in the context of thermal field theories , plays a special role in the infrared ( low - momentum ) limit of the theory . as mentioned previously , the infrared physics of bosonic theories is not accessible to plain perturbation theory , and resummation techniques are required in order to produce sensible results . in common ,",
    "all such techniques render a special treatment to the zero mode is not a true fourier mode since it is not orthogonal to @xmath63 in @xmath56 $ ] , but in @xmath49 $ ] . with this caveat in mind",
    ", we will continue to refer to @xmath14 as a mode of @xmath15 . ] .",
    "it is important to stress that the zero mode @xmath14 is _ not _ the zero mode of the usual matsubara expansion .",
    "in fact , from eq . , one can notice that @xmath14 involves the coefficients of all matsubara modes : @xmath64 the present identification of the zero mode with the boundary field in the context of quantum statistical mechanics aggregates to the zero - mode physics yet another important feature : the connection with the classical behavior at high temperatures .",
    "that regime is characterized by the condition @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 , in natural units ) , where @xmath67 is the typical spacing between quantum levels . in order to see why the static mode governs the classical limit of the partition function ,",
    "let us consider @xmath68 , the solution of the equation of motion :    [ eulerlagrange ] @xmath69    in the high - temperature regime ( @xmath70 ) , thermal fluctuations dominate . in this limit , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and",
    "we obtain for the partition function @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a normalization factor which incorporates quantum fluctuations .",
    "a proper normalization of @xmath3 leads to @xmath75 , rendering the semiclassical expression @xmath76 with @xmath77 , @xmath78 being the particle mass .    as discussed in @xcite",
    ", for @xmath66 the correlation @xmath79 follows the classical linear scaling with @xmath80 .",
    "this behavior is entirely associated with the static component of @xmath15 , and represents a problem for the high - temperature limit of the usual perturbative expansion .",
    "in contrast , the subtracted thermal propagator ( without the contribution from the static mode ) goes to zero as @xmath80 increases , so that one should strongly improve the convergence of the perturbation expansion by calculating diagrams with that subtracted propagator .",
    "we conclude that , either to control infrared divergences in thermal field theories or to describe the classical limit in quantum statistical mechanics , we need a separate treatment of the zero mode . the main advantage of our approach is to provide this separation in a natural fashion .    in order to explore the zero - mode physics ,",

    "we have shown that , in order to allow for non - periodicity , one has to define a modified expansion into matsubara modes .    in this paper , we have followed our alternative strategy in the case of quantum statistical mechanics , viewed not only as a toy model for the case of finite - temperature field theory , but also as a prototype for various relevant systems in statistical physics .",
    "more specifically , we have explored an alternative way of computing the partition function in the path - integral formalism that includes non - periodic trajectories , for which the usual matsubara expansion leads to an incorrect result for the action of the trajectory . as was shown above",
    ", one can properly incorporate the contribution of non - periodic paths by using a modified matsubara series expansion in which the zero mode is identified with the boundary value of the path .",
    "the latter turns out to be the stochastic variable that survives in the final effective theory .",
    "the approach proposed in this paper has , thus , the advantage of providing a natural separation of the physics of the zero mode .",
    "in fact , we built a very simple effective theory for the zero mode in the nontrivial problem of the anharmonic oscillator , obtaining very precise results for practically the whole range of temperatures , and in a framework that is free of spurious divergences .",
    "in particular , we were able to describe the semiclassical ( high - temperature ) limit of the anharmonic oscillator without any information about the classical solutions .",
    "we expect that other potentials can profit from the simplicity of the present method in quantum mechanical systems .    in the case of finite - temperature field theory",
    "there are , of course , subtle issues of renormalization , which are absent in the quantum mechanical setting , that will have to be addressed . nevertheless , the results obtained in quantum statistical mechanics are encouraging , and we hope that this new perspective may shed light onto the problem of infrared divergences . results in this direction",
