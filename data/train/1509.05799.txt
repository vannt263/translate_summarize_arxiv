    "the reason for the small dimer - production rate in @xcite is that the coupling to highly excited bound states is very small as will be shown in this work . on the other hand , as demonstrated in @xcite , losses at inelastic cir occur dominantly due to the coupling of a rel .- motion bound state with low - order c.m .",
