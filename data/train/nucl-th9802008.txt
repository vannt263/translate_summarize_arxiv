    "recently , there has been a lot of interest in the study of the proton drip - line nucleus @xmath1b which is perhaps the most likely candidate for having a proton halo structure  @xcite , since its last proton has a binding energy of only 137 kev .",
    "several measurements reported lately do seem to provide evidence in favor of this possibility .",
    "for example , the electric quadrupole moment of @xmath1b is found to be twice as large as the value predicted by the shell model , which can be explained with a single particle wave function corresponding to a matter density of root mean square ( rms ) radius of 2.72 fm  @xcite . the observed narrow longitudinal momentum ( @xmath6 ) distribution of the @xmath2be fragment emitted in the breakup reaction of 1.47 gev / nucleon @xmath1b on @xmath7 target has been interpreted in terms of a greatly extended proton distribution in @xmath1b  @xcite .",
    "the significantly enhanced reaction cross sections of @xmath1b measured at beam energies between 20 - 60 mev / nucleon are shown to be consistent with the large matter radius of @xmath1b required to explain its quadrupole moment  @xcite .    nevertheless , the existence of a proton halo in @xmath1b is still an open issue .",
    "nakada and otsuka  @xcite have shown that @xmath8 shell model calculations can reproduce the measured large quadrupole moment of @xmath1b without invoking a proton halo structure .",
    "the interaction cross sections measured by tanihata et al .",
    "@xcite at 790 mev / nucleon are consistent with a normal size of @xmath1b .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution of the @xmath2be fragment emitted in the breakup reaction of @xmath1b at 41 mev / nucleon has been found to be dependent on the target mass in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is argued that in contrast to the situation in the neutron halo nuclei  @xcite , the assumption of an unusually extended spatial distribution is not necessary to explain the narrow @xmath6 distribution in case of @xmath1b ; the reaction mechanism plays an important role here .",
    "breakup reactions in which the halo particle(s ) is(are ) removed from the projectile in the coulomb and nuclear fields of the target nucleus , have played a significant role in probing the neutron halo structure in some light neutron drip - line nuclei ( see e.g.  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the enhanced total coulomb breakup cross sections  @xcite , narrow longitudinal momentum distributions of the heavy fragments  @xcite , and sharply forward peaked angular distributions of the valence neutron(s )  @xcite are some of the pivotal observations through which the neutron halo structure has been well manifested .",
    "apart from the @xmath6 distributions of the @xmath2be fragment , some data on the total cross section of the breakup reaction @xmath1b + a @xmath9 @xmath2be + x on low mass targets have also become available recently  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies reported so far have used either the serber type  @xcite of models  @xcite or the diffraction dissociation picture  @xcite developed by sitenko and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "both these approaches are essentially semi - classical in nature , hence a more microscopic calculation within the quantum mechanical scattering theory is needed to interpret the data properly .",
    "a proper understanding of the nuclear breakup of @xmath1b is also important in the context of the extraction of the astrophysical @xmath10-factor for the radiative capture reaction @xmath2be(p,@xmath11)@xmath1b from the coulomb dissociation of @xmath1b  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we present calculations of the cross sections for the breakup reaction @xmath1b",
    "@xmath12 @xmath0si @xmath9 @xmath2be @xmath12 x within a direct fragmentation model ( dfm ) , which is formulated in the framework of the post form distorted wave born approximation ( pfdwba )  @xcite .",
    "as the target nucleus involved in this reaction is very light , we shall consider only the nuclear breakup process .",
    "however , the coulomb breakup can also be calculated in this theory on the same footing ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the next section we present the details of our formalism . in section 3 ,",
    "our results are presented and discussed .",
    "the conclusions of our work are described in section 4 .",
    "the nuclear breakup cross section consists of two components : the elastic breakup ( elb ) ( also known as `` diffraction dissociation '' ) where x corresponds to the target nucleus a in its ground state and proton , and inelastic breakup ( inelb ) ( also known as `` diffraction stripping '' ) where x can be any other channel of the a @xmath12 p system .",
    "the triple differential cross section for the elastic breakup reaction @xmath13 ( e.g for our case , @xmath14 = @xmath1b , @xmath15 = @xmath2be , @xmath16 = p ) , is defined as @xmath17 where the transition amplitude @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath20 is the orbital angular momentum for relative @xmath15 + @xmath16 system and @xmath21 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "@xmath22 represents the interaction between constituents @xmath15 and @xmath16 while @xmath23 is the wave function for their relative motion in the projectile ground state .",
    "@xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are the momenta ( reduced masses ) of the particles @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "@xmath30 s denote the scattering wave functions which are generated by the appropriate optical potentials in respective channels .",
    "the system of coordinates used are the same as that given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the transition amplitude is a six dimensional integral . by making a zero range approximation ( zra )",
    "this integral is reduced to three dimensions  @xcite , although its calculation is still a major problem as it involves a product of three scattering waves which converge very slowly . in the zra",
    "the details of the internal structure of the projectile appear in the amplitude only through an overall normalization constant and the values of @xmath20 other than zero are necessarily excluded .",
    "because of the relative p - state between @xmath2be and the proton in the ground state of @xmath1b the zra , therefore , is not suitable for this case .",
    "however , we introduce a constant range approximation ( cra ) which reduces the integral in eq .",
    "( 2 ) to three dimensions and at the same time allows the non - zero values of @xmath20 to enter in the calculations .",
    "we assume that the breakup reaction is strongly peripheral and that only those configurations where ( 1 ) the proton is in the collinear position between the target nucleus and @xmath2be and ( 2 ) the relative separation between proton and @xmath2be is constant ( say @xmath31 @xmath32 ) , contribute to the transition amplitude .",
    "we can then write @xmath33 where @xmath31 is taken to be the distance between origin and the maximum in the @xmath1b ground state wave function .",
    "approximations similar to the cra have been used earlier by phlhoffer et al .",
    "@xcite and kubo and hirata  @xcite to study the @xmath34 transfer reactions induced by @xmath35li and @xmath2li projectiles within the dwba .",
    "these authors have found a reasonable agreement between the calculated and measured angular distributions particularly for momentum matched transitions . furthermore , as long as the reaction is not sensitive to the smaller distances , the results obtained with eq .",
    "( 3 ) are in agreement with those of the full finite range calculations .    substituting eq .",
    "( 3 ) in eq . ( 2 ) , making partial wave expansion for @xmath36 and using eq . ( 4.13 ) of  @xcite , we get @xmath37 where the reduced amplitude @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 in eq . ( 5 ) we have @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the radial part of the wave function @xmath36 .",
    "( 5 ) is similar to the amplitude obtained with the zra and can be evaluated by using the method described in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the zero range amplitudes are retrieved from eq .",
    "( 4 ) - eq .",
    "( 6 ) by assuming @xmath20 and @xmath31 equal to zero .",
    "the transition amplitude for the inelastic breakup reaction @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is some final state of the system @xmath44 , is given by  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the form factor , which is obtained by taking the overlap of the wave function for the channel @xmath43 ( which incorporates all the possible reactions initiated by the interaction between nuclei @xmath47 and @xmath16 ) , with the wave function describing the internal states of the target and projectile nuclei .",
    "( 3 ) and other steps as described above , an expression similar to eq . ( 4 ) can be derived for @xmath48 with the reduced amplitude given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radial part of the form factor .",
    "its calculation simplifies greatly if we introduce the so called `` surface approximation '' and write @xmath50 in terms of its asymptotic form @xmath51 where @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 being the regular and irregular coulomb wave functions .",
    "this equation can be rewritten in terms of the elastic scattering wave function @xmath41 ( see eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) as @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the @xmath10 matrix elements for the elastic channel corresponding to the angular momentum @xmath57 .",
    "the validity of the surface approximation has been tested by kasano and ichimura  @xcite who found it to be well fulfilled even for the deuteron .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( 11 ) for the form factor @xmath58 also in the interior region in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , which is not expected to be a serious approximation as this region contributes very little to the whole dwba integral . in order to calculate the inelastic breakup cross section",
    "one has to sum over all the channels @xmath59 , which can be easily done by using the unitarity of the @xmath10 matrix as all the dependence on channel @xmath43 in the transition amplitude rests in the @xmath10 matrix @xmath60 @xmath61 thus the inelastic breakup cross section can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the same as the amplitude defined in eq .",
    "( 4 ) with the wave function @xmath41 replaced by the regular coulomb function .",
    "the partial reaction and elastic cross sections @xmath64 and @xmath65 are related to the scattering matrix elements @xmath56 by their usual definitions .",
    "it may be noted that the quantities required to calculate the inelastic breakup are the same as those already calculated in the case of elastic breakup .    in order to study the impact parameter dependence of the breakup cross section",
    ", we define the `` probability of breakup '' @xmath66 as @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( 14 ) , @xmath68 is the sum of the elastic and inelastic breakup cross sections given by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "the optical potentials in the entrance and outgoing channels and the constants @xmath69 and @xmath31 are required as input in our numerical calculations .",
    "although some elastic scattering data for the @xmath1b , @xmath2be + @xmath70c systems at the beam energy of 40 mev / nucleon are available  @xcite , the usual optical model fits to them is unfortunately not reported .",
    "unless otherwise stated , our calculations have been performed with the following set of optical potentials , @xmath71 = 123.0 mev , @xmath72 = 0.75 fm , @xmath73 = 0.80 fm , @xmath74 = 65.0 mev , @xmath75 = 0.78 fm , @xmath76 = 0.80 fm , with real and imaginary volume woods - saxon terms .",
    "this potential , which is similar to that used in the recent analysis of @xmath77li and @xmath78li elastic scattering  @xcite , has been used for both @xmath1b and @xmath2be .",
    "the @xmath79 convention was followed to get the radii from the radius parameters .",
    "the global becchetti - greenlees parameterization  @xcite was used for the proton - target potential .",
    "the constants @xmath69 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and @xmath31 have been determined with a @xmath1b ground state wave function obtained by assuming it to be a pure @xmath80 proton single particle state , with separation energy 0.137 mev , calculated in a central woods - saxon potential of geometry , @xmath81 = 1.54 fm , and @xmath82 = 0.52 fm  @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath69 = -39.0 mev @xmath83 and @xmath31 = 1.8 fm , which has been used in all the calculations described in this paper .",
    "the radius and diffuseness parameters used by barker  @xcite ( @xmath81 = 1.25 fm , and @xmath82 = 0.65 fm ) , and esbensen and bertsch ( @xmath81 = 1.25 fm , and @xmath82 = 0.52 fm )  @xcite lead to @xmath69 = -40.4 and -41.7 mev @xmath83 and @xmath31 = 1.8 and 1.7 fm respectively . on the other hand , with more elaborate rpa models for the @xmath2be + p overlap wave function  @xcite",
    ", the values of @xmath69 and @xmath31 are found to be -38.0 mev @xmath83 and 1.8 fm respectively .",
    "hence , the constants @xmath69 and @xmath31 do not show any marked dependence on the nuclear structure model of @xmath1b .",
    "for the sake of comparison with other approaches the simplified potential model as used by us seems to be adequate at this stage of the present theory .",
    "1 shows the calculated elastic ( dotted line ) , inelastic ( dashed line ) and total ( solid line ) breakup cross sections for the @xmath1b @xmath12 @xmath0si @xmath9 @xmath2be @xmath12 x reaction as a function of beam energy together with the data taken from  @xcite .",
    "we see that the measured total breakup cross sections are well reproduced by our calculations although the contributions of the elastic and inelastic breakup modes are slightly over- and under - predicted respectively .",
    "the breakup cross sections decrease with beam energy up to 20 mev / a and after that they are almost constant ( although the inelastic breakup mode still shows a tendency of decreasing somewhat ) .",
    "the nuclear breakup cross sections of @xmath1b as reported in  @xcite show a similar type of energy dependence in this beam energy regime although their increase below 20 mev / nucleon is less pronounced than that seen in fig .",
    "1 . clearly , more measurements are needed to clarify this point .    a striking feature of the results shown in fig .",
    "1 is that the contribution of the inelastic breakup mode to the total breakup cross section is limited only to about 30@xmath3 , which is in agreement with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the situation in stable nuclei where this mode of breakup makes up about 75 - 80 @xmath3 of the total @xmath84 breakup cross section ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . to understand this difference",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "2 the breakup probability ( @xmath85 ) ( defined by eq . ( 14 ) ) for the reaction @xmath0si(@xmath1b , @xmath2be ) as a function of the impact parameter @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath85 peaks at about 8 fm , which is in remarkable agreement with that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the semi - classical arguments .",
    "this is quite large in comparison to the sum of the radii ( @xmath88 ) of @xmath1b and @xmath0si ( @xmath89 6 fm ) .",
    "furthermore , most of the contribution to @xmath85 comes from the impact parameters beyond 8 fm , while those from distances @xmath90 @xmath88 are strongly suppressed .",
    "this clearly shows that the breakup of @xmath1b takes place far away from the nuclear surface which reduces the probability of the inelastic breakup process ; large impact parameters favor the elastic breakup mode .",
    "in contrast , for stable isotopes , the breakup probability peaks around @xmath88 ( where the inelastic breakup mode is maximum ) and the drop from the peak value for @xmath91 is much faster than that seen in fig . 2  @xcite .",
    "this , explains to some extent the difference in the nature of the inelastic breakup cross section of @xmath1b as compared to that of the stable isotopes .",
    "the fact that the breakup of @xmath1b is dominated by contributions coming from a large range of impact parameters @xmath92 , is in agreement with the observation made earlier in the case of neutron halo nuclei @xmath78li and @xmath78be  @xcite .",
    "this could provide an indirect evidence for a larger spatial extension of the proton in the ground state of @xmath1b .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that a @xmath80 configuration for the p - @xmath2be relative motion already leads to a @xmath1b matter density with a larger rms radius  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the present calculations the @xmath1b structure input largely affects only the absolute magnitudes of the cross sections ( through the constant @xmath69 ) ; the peak position in fig . 2",
    "is mostly decided by the reaction dynamics .",
    "it is possible , in principle , to include other components ( eg .",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 ) in the @xmath1b wave function within this formalism .",
    "however , as the @xmath80 component carries by far the largest spectroscopic weight ( @xmath95 90 @xmath3 ) , this is unlikely to alter our results much .    as a side remark",
    ", we point out that the relative contributions of the elastic and inelastic breakup modes are independent of the uncertainties in the values of @xmath69 and @xmath31 as the same constants enter in all the cross sections .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show the contributions of elastic and inelastic breakup modes to the energy distribution of the @xmath2be fragment at the beam energy of 30 mev / nucleon .",
    "one notes that while the elastic breakup mode dominates in the peak region , its contribution is very weak towards the high energy end ( where the proton energy @xmath96 ) ; total cross section is made up mostly of the inelastic breakup mode in this region .",
    "the threshold behavior of the breakup cross section can be easily understood from that of the phase - shift @xmath97 of the scattering of the proton from the target .",
    "it can be shown that  @xcite in the limit @xmath96 , the elastic and inelastic breakup cross sections are proportional to @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 is the radius of the nuclear potential ) respectively .",
    "therefore , in this limit the elastic breakup cross section tends to zero even for the @xmath101 wave a + p interaction while the inelastic one to a finite value , which explains the observation made in fig .",
    "3 . it would be very interesting therefore , to perform measurements for the energy spectra of the fragment @xmath2be to confirm the @xmath96 behavior .",
    "it may help in fixing the absolute magnitude of the inelastic breakup cross section in the breakup experiments .",
    "to conclude , we have presented for the first time a fully quantum mechanical calculation of the elastic and inelastic modes of the nuclear breakup of @xmath1b on the si target .",
    "we employed a direct fragmentation model which is formulated within the framework of the post form distorted wave born - approximation .",
    "this is a definite improvement over the semi - classical models of the breakup reactions used so far for this purpose .",
    "we obtain a good overall description of the experimental data measured recently .",
    "the inelastic breakup mode is found to contribute only up to 30@xmath3 to the total breakup cross section for the @xmath0si(@xmath1b,@xmath2be ) reaction , which is in contrast to the breakup of the stable isotopes .",
    "most of the contributions to the breakup cross section come from the distances far beyond the nuclear surface which favors the elastic breakup mode .",
    "the energy spectra of the @xmath2be fragment is dominated by the inelastic breakup mode towards the high energy end where the proton energy goes to zero .",
    "this observation which is beyond the scope of the semi - classical models , is a natural outcome of the pfdwba theory of the breakup reactions and it should be verified experimentally .",
    "we must stress that the lack of the precise knowledge about the parameters of the optical potential for the @xmath1b,@xmath2be @xmath12 @xmath0si system is a potential source of uncertainty in our calculations .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the existing data ( taken at around 40 mev / nucleon ) for this system  @xcite in terms of the conventional optical model would be extremely useful .",
    "moreover , similar studies at other beam energies are also clearly needed .",
    "the present calculations are not very sensitive to the nuclear structure models of @xmath1b .",
    "the direct fragmentation model should be improved further so that more detail of the projectile wave function can enter in the calculations explicitly .",
    "once such an extended reaction description is available , the use of more elaborate nuclear structure models of the projectile will be meaningful .",
    "it may then become possible to use the breakup data to distinguish the wave functions of @xmath1b obtained from a static potential model from those calculated from dynamical approaches  @xcite where the deformation of this nucleus is taken into account .",
