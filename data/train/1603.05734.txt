    "the coupling between magnetosphere and ionosphere in solar planets reveals many important physical processes , which may have significant implications on distant astrophysical systems [ mauk , anderson and thorne , 2002 ] .",
    "since first detected in 1964 [ bigg 1964 ] , the io correlated jovian decametric bursts have been well studied [ goldreich and lynden - bell 1969 ; riihimaa 1968 ; imai , wang and carr 1997 ] . the implied interaction between jupiter and io has been attracting attention in the community for more than two decades [ dessler 1983 ; belcher 1987 ] .",
    "pioneer 11 first detected a plasma concentration near io [ fillius , mcilwain and mogro - campero 1975 ] , which was later revealed by voyager 1 as a plasma torus [ broadfoot et al .",
    "the powerful euv emission from this io s plasma torus ( @xmath1 w ) has posed a theoretical challenge since it was confirmed by voyager 2 [ sandel et al .",
    "several models have been developed to account for this , among which are the unipolar inductor model [ goldreich and lynden - bell 1969 , belcher 1987 ] , the alfvn wing theory [ drell , foley and ruderman 1965 ; neubauer 1980 ] and the model with an extended neutral cloud distributed in the torus [ brown and ip 1981 ; trauger 1984 ] , with the last one being favored both theoretically [ barbosa , coroniti and eviatar 1983 ; barbosa 1994 ; shemansky 1980 ] and observationally [ smyth and shemansky 1983 ; skinner and durrance 1986 ] .",
    "although all the models achieve in explaining certain observations , a global picture of the jupiter - io coupling system , which unifies these models , does not exist .",
    "significant progresses were made in recently years with the detection of io s footprint on jovian ionosphere both at ir with the nasa irtf [ connerney et al .",
    "1993 ; satoh and connerney 1999 ] and at uv with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) [ clarke et al . 1996 ] .",
    "this is especially the case for the newly reported downstream emission of the io s footprint [ clarke et al .",
    "2002 ] since it indicates strong coupling between jupiter s ionosphere and io s plasma torus over an extend region [ hill and vasylinas 2002 ; grard et al . 2002 ] .",
    "now observations exist on both ends of this coupling system . combining the recent hst observations on the io s footprint with the galileo spacecraft s _ in situ _ measurements [ frank et al .",
    "1996 ; kivelson et al . 1996",
    "; gurnett et al . 1996 ] , we develop a self - consistent model for one of the key features in the io s plasma torus  the bright ribbon [ trauger 1984 ; dessler and sandel 1993 ; schneider and trauger 1995 ; volwerk et al .",
    "1997 ] .",
    "our basic model assumption is that , led by io , the extended neutral cloud is concentrated within a narrow region of a few io s radii .",
    "then a self - consistent hydrodynamical model is developed for such a cloud with ionization and plasma diffusion processes parameterized .",
    "the ionization of this neutral gas will not only energize the plasma around it , which eventually lead to the formation of the bright ribbon feature detected in the torus , but also induce significant birkeland currents which close in the northern and southern jovian ionospheres , producing the io s footprint and its downstream emission .",
    "thus correlation is expected between emissions from the ribbon and that from its footprint . in the paper",
    ", we mainly study the energy flows in the system .",
    "our model calculation indicates that the energy transportation to jovian ionosphere via birkeland current , which is localized near io s flux tube , is comparable to the energy dissipation in the plasma torus , which is relatively uniform along the ribbon .",
    "future coordinated observations will be able to test the model .    in   [ equas ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the basic ideas for introducing such a model and develop full dynamical equations for the ribbon .",
    "the observational constraints on the model parameters are discussed in   [ para ] .",
    "we then show that there is a very simple analytical solution to the dynamical equations . in   [ fit ] , we calculate the model predicted energy flows and compare them with observations .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in   [ con ] .",
    "there is much observational evidence for the existence of an extended neutral cloud in the io s plasma torus [ see e.g. smyth and shemansky 1983 ; skinner and durrance 1986 ] . theoretically , shemansky [ 1980 ] first pointed out that the mass loading around io is so insufficient that the heating of the plasma induced by it can not balance the cooling due to euv emission from the plasma torus .",
    "this conclusion was later confirmed by the galileo _ in situ _ measurement [ bagenal 1997 ] .",
    "russell and huddleston [ 2000 ] recently showed that a small mass loading rate near io is also consistent with observations of the jupiter - io system made over the past three decades .",
    "this small mass loading rate near io then suggests an extended mass loading region , which may associated with the extended neutral cloud observed .",
    "a narrow ribbon in the io s plasma torus was first reported by trauger [ 1984 ] with earth - based optical observations .",
    "dessler and sandel [ 1993 ] later showed that the strong euv emission from the torus detected by the voyagers is confined within a region less than @xmath2 in width , where @xmath3 m is the radius of io , consistent with galileo observations which reveal dramatic changes in the plasma s property while galileo flying through the narrow wake of io ( @xmath4 ) [ frank et al .",
    "1996 ; kivelson et al .",
    "1996 ; gurnett et al .",
    "the recent high - quality images of [ s ii ] 6731   emissions from @xmath5 , on the other hand , show this plasma feature in unprecedented detail [ schneider and trauger 1995 ] .",
    "because we are mostly interested in its time - averaged properties , the ribbon can then be approximated as in a steady state .",
    "we will assume that the narrow ribbon is surrounded by a background plasma and the plasma and neutral gas distributions inside the ribbon only depend on their azimuthal coordinate . by neglecting the variations of the gas and plasma properties in the radial and vertical directions inside the ribbon",
    ", we reduce the study to an one dimensional problem . as the first step of such a investigation ,",
    "these approximations are good enough to address the relevant energy transportation processes .",
    "however the detailed gas and plasma distributions will control the corresponding diffusion and ionization processes , which are crucial for a self - consistent hydrodynamical model . in the following discussion",
    ", we will parameterize these processes in accord with these approximations .",
    "we will develop the model in io s rest frame .",
    "then the mass conservation law is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass density of the ions inside the ribbon and @xmath8 is the plasma s velocity .",
    "the neutral gas is roughly in a keplerian orbit .",
    "thus its velocity in io s rest frame is zero .",
    "then we have @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the neutral gas mass density , which is zero outside the ribbon , @xmath11 is the background ion density , @xmath12 is the mean lifetime of the neutral gas , which characterizes the ionization processes and @xmath13 is the diffusion time scale of the ions .",
    "a prime here denotes derivative with respective to the azimuthal coordinate . in obtaining equation ( [ mass - con ] ) , we have assumed that the background ions only have the effect of suppressing the diffusive loss of ions from the ribbon .    from the momentum conservation equation @xmath14",
    "we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the current density and @xmath17 is the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the first term on the lhs of equation ( [ mom2 ] ) comes from the current acceleration by the magnetic field .",
    "the second term is associated with the diffusive loss of ions from the ribbon . combining this equation with equation ( [ mass - con ] ) ,",
    "we get @xmath18 which says that the current acceleration provides the momentum to speed up the ion newly produced via neutral gas ionization , which corresponds to the first term on the rhs , and the momentum to accelerate the plasma flow as indicated by the second term on the rhs .",
    "the energy conservation law is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the plasma energy density per unit mass and @xmath21 is the plasma s thermal energy density per unit mass . from this",
    ", we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the electric field , @xmath24 is the cooling rate due to line emission . multiplying equation ( [ mom - con ] ) with @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 combining this equation with equation ( [ eng - con ] ) , one then gets @xmath27 this equation shows the energy balance between the cooling due to line emission and the heating introduced by the injection of new plasma produced through neutral cloud ionization , corresponding to the first term on the rhs , and energy advection which corresponds to the second term on the rhs .    to calculate the power carried by birkeland current , which includes the power dissipated in the jovian ionosphere and that consumed in the electron accelerating double layers [ mauk et al .",
    "2002 ] , we note that the e.m.f . per unit length produced by the plasma inside the ribbon equals @xmath28 , where @xmath29 km  s@xmath30 is the rigid corotation velocity at io s orbit .",
    "multiplying equation ( [ mom - con ] ) with @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the electric field in jupiter s co - rotation frame .",
    "then the lhs gives the power of the birkeland current .",
    "the first term on the rhs comes from the pickup current and the second term is associated with the acceleration current .",
    "equation ( [ mom - con ] ) can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the height - integrated current density , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the neutral gas content and plasma content per unit magnetic flux inside the ribbon respectively .",
    "this current closes in the jovian ionosphere .",
    "then the current continuity equation can be written as [ hill 2002 ] @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the height - integrated peterson current , @xmath40 is the height - integrated conductivity of jovian ionosphere [ strobel et al .",
    "1983 ] , @xmath41 is the strength of the electric field in jovian ionosphere and @xmath42 .",
    "if we neglect the potential drop across the double layers in the birkeland circuit , we have @xmath43 then from equations ( [ mom - con1 ] ) , ( [ continuity ] ) , ( [ ohm ] ) , ( [ potential ] ) and ( [ mass - con ] ) , we have the basic equations for the ribbon : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the plasma content per unit magnetic flux of the background within which the ribbon embedded .",
    "then if we neglect the neutral gas injection and plasma diffusion , i.e. let @xmath46 , we have the results reported by hill [ 2002 ] .",
    "note in hill s paper , he assumed that @xmath47 is a constant , which is actually a very crude treatment of the plasma diffusion processes and the mass conservation law .",
    "our equations are accurate with the corresponding physical processes parameterized .",
    "on the other hand , if we neglect the acceleration current , we have the results given by hill and pontius [ 1998 ] and by pontius and hill [ 1982 ] .",
    "in equations ( [ mom - con2 ] ) and ( [ mass - con1 ] ) , @xmath48 depends on the mechanism through which the neutral gas is picked up from io and gets ionized , and @xmath49 depends on how the plasma diffuses away from the torus .",
    "because both processes are not well understood , we will leave @xmath48 , @xmath49 as input functions .",
    "@xmath17 is measured by kivelson et al . [",
    "1996 ] with the magnetometer on galileo : @xmath50nt .",
    "@xmath40 is given by aeronomy models [ e.g. , strobel and atreya , 1983 ] .",
    "we will adopt a fiducial value of @xmath51 . for given @xmath52 and @xmath49 ,",
    "@xmath13 can be fixed by the steady state condition ( we will address this in detail in the following discussion ) when we solve the equations for @xmath25 and @xmath47 . then with the thermal properties of the plasma determined with models of the corresponding microscopic processes [ barbosa , coroniti and eviatar 1983 ] , we can calculate the model predicated emissions from the ribbon , which can be compared with observations directly . at the same time , the power of the birkeland current can be associated with observations on the io s footprints on jovian ionosphere [ clarke et al 2002 ] .",
    "strong correlation between emissions from the torus and that from io s footprints is expected .    to solve the equations numerically , it is convenient to put the equations in a dimensionless form .",
    "we define @xmath53 where @xmath54 gives the characteristic dynamical time scale .",
    "@xmath55 is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total mass injection rate throughtout the ribbon , @xmath58 is orbital radius of the torus [ broadfoot et al .",
    "1979 ] , @xmath59 m is jupiter s radius , @xmath60 is the width of the ribbon .",
    "we will assume that the ribbon has a width of @xmath61 .",
    "observations [ [ trauger 1984 ; dessler and sandel 1993 ; schneider and trauger 1995 ] indicate that the height of the narrow bright feature in io s plasma torus is @xmath62 , which is much larger than the width of the ribbon .",
    "this is because the diffusion of ions is not isotropic in the plasma torus due to the existence of the strong magnetic field , which is roughly perpendicular to the plasma s orbital plane .",
    "such an anisotropy will make the plasma spread out in the direction parallel to the magnetic field line .",
    "and the deviation of the magnetic field line from the vertical direction also enhances this effect when we have new ions produced via neutral gas ionization as is the case in our model .",
    "because the observed feature is associated with the ion distribution directly , we would expect that the emission region be more extended in the vertical direction than in the radial direction .",
    "however , the diffusion of neutral gas is almost isotropic .",
    "so we can assume that the cross section of the ribbon is a square .",
    "there are several independent estimates of the mass injection rate into the torus .",
    "the uvs observation shows the total power of the uv emission from the torus is no less than @xmath63 w [ sandel et al . , 1979 ] , implying a mass loading rate @xmath64 kg sec@xmath30 [ siscoe and chen , 1977 ] .",
    "dessler [ 1980 ] show that @xmath65 kg sec@xmath30 based on the energy supply to the jovian magnetosphere from jupiter s rotation .",
    "the plasma production via ionization of the neutral gas from io in the magnetosphere will induce a slip of the plasma relative to corotation as the plasma flows outwards and angular momentum is transported from jupiter out to the plasma flow [ hill 1979 ] .",
    "voyager 1 plasma observations [ bridge et al . 1979 ]",
    "indicate : @xmath66",
    "kg sec@xmath30 [ hill , 1980 ] .",
    "so @xmath67 kg sec@xmath30 is a reasonable fiducial mass injection rate .",
    "then we have @xmath68 equations ( [ mom - con2 ] ) and ( [ mass - con1 ] ) then can be written as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71    a self - consistent steady state solution is also subject to the following constraints : @xmath72 = 0\\ , .",
    "\\label{balance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first constraint sets the normalization condition for @xmath24 . to get the second constraint , we have assumed that the flux of the plasma inside the ribbon satisfies the periodic boundary condition .",
    "however , other physical properties of the plasma do nt need to be continuous across io because shocks will be produced there . for given neutral cloud distribution in the torus , @xmath73 , satisfying condition ( [ massload ] ) , background ion distribution @xmath74 and boundary conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 , it is obvious that not all the solutions of equations ( [ mom - con3 ] ) and ( [ mass - con2 ] ) satisfy condition ( [ balance ] ) . only certain value of @xmath77 ( eign value ) can make condition ( [ balance ] ) satisfied . for arbitrary input functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we must choose an @xmath77 to get a solution , then we check on condition ( [ balance ] ) and adjust @xmath77 until it is satisfied .",
    "the calculation is quite complicated .",
    "fortunately , in the case that @xmath78 everywhere and @xmath74 is a constant , which we call local equilibrium in a smooth background , we have the following solution : @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 can be fixed with the boundary conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "galileo observation shows that the averaged mass flux in io s wake is about @xmath82 kg sec@xmath30 m@xmath83 , where we have used a background speed of @xmath84 m sec@xmath30 [ bagenal 1997 ] .",
    "we also assumed a mean ion mass of 24 amu [ hill 2002 ] . from this",
    "we have @xmath85    galileo observations also reveal a sharp increase of electron number density and decrease in the flow velocity in io s wake .",
    "and the background mass flux is @xmath86 kg sec@xmath30 m@xmath83 .",
    "we will adopt a value of @xmath87 m sec@xmath30 as a characteristic averaged initial velocity of the flow inside the ribbon . then the initial mean mass density of the plasma is @xmath88 km m@xmath89 , corresponding to an ion number density of @xmath90 cm@xmath89 .",
    "then we have @xmath92\\left({11.3[\\sigma/11.3]-3.2\\alpha[g_b/3.2]\\over 11.3[\\sigma/11.3]-5.2\\alpha[c_1/5.2]}\\right)\\ , .",

    "fitting observations of the fuv io tail on jupiter [ grard et al . 2002 ] , we find @xmath96 then solving equations ( [ c2 ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) , one has @xmath97",
    "so we have the structure of the ribbon : @xmath98 in figure [ fig1.ps ] we give the normalized power distributions in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the model gives a reasonable fit to observations of the fuv io tail on jupiter .",
    "figure [ fig2.ps ] shows the integrated power distributions .",
    "the integrations start at io . from this",
    "we see that most of the power associated with the birkeland current is localized around io . however , the power dissipation in the torus is quite uniform .",
    "the model then fails to explain the io phase effect which says that about @xmath99 of the euv power from the io s plasma torus is correlated with io [ sandel & broadfoot 1982b ] .",
    "this is not a surprise given our crude treatment of the boundary conditions near io .",
    "galileo _ in situ _ observations show that the power supplied to the torus near io accounts for @xmath100 to @xmath101 of the total euv power from the torus [ bagenal 1997 ] , suggesting that io phase effect is associated with the processes near io .",
    "investigation of these processes is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a global self - consistent picture of the jupiter - io system should incorporate these processes with the model we developed here for the ribbon .",
    "we also note that the total power dissipated in the torus is @xmath102w , which is consistent with the euv observations of emission from the torus .",
    "the power associated with the birkeland current is @xmath103w which , when combined with the observed fuv power from io s footprint , implies a fuv radiation efficiency of @xmath104 .",
    "this total power supply to jovian ionosphere via birkeland current sets a very strict constraint on the excitation mechanism of the fuv io tail . when combining with an auroral atmosphere model",
    ", one can infer an model predicted @xmath105 brightness at io s footprint , which can be compared with the corresponding observations . the total power supplied to the torus via ionization of the neutral cloud in the ribbon",
    "is given by @xmath106 which is smaller than the sum of the power dissipated in the torus and that associated with the birkeland current .",
    "the power excess comes from the mass loading near io , which breaks the periodic conditions for the ribbon .",
    "so there is a net energy flux from the ends of the ribbon , where io locates .    in figure",
    "[ fig3.ps ] , we show the current distribution @xmath107 in the azimuthal direction , where @xmath108 and the integrated current .",
    "the current near io is @xmath109ampere , which is consistent with voyager 1 _ in situ _ observations [ belcher 1987 ] .",
    "the total current across the ribbon is @xmath110ampere .",
    "because the newly produced ion via ionization of the neutral cloud gains momentum through the current , we can estimate the total current across ribbon from the mass injection rate in the torus : @xmath111 the fact that this current is smaller than the value from our numerical calculation also suggests local excess of mass injection near io , which requires extra current to accelerate the ions in the ribbon to the velocity of the background plasma .",
    "in this paper , we develop a self - consistent model for the bright ribbon in io s plasma torus .",
    "most of the model parameters were determined theoretically or via observations .",
    "thus the model is well constrained . to compare with observations of the fuv io tail on jupiter , we gave the simplest analytical solution of the equations , which control the structure of the ribbon .",
    "the model predicts a neutral cloud ionization rate as : @xmath112 which can be combined with a model detailing the ionization processes of the neutral cloud to make predictions on observations in the optical band [ smyth and shemansky 1983 ] .",
    "the model also requires an ion distribution of @xmath113 inside the ribbon .",
    "this number density is higher than the canonical value of @xmath114cm@xmath89 by more than a factor of 3 .",
    "although this high number density implies a relatively larger cooling rate , the density is not high enough to explain the short cooling time reported by volwerk et al . [",
    "however , we noticed that the lack of correlation between the brightnesses of the two ansae can also be explained as due to some plasma processes , such as plasma waves et al .",
    "these processes can dump a local enhancement of energy density with the corresponding time scales .",
    "for example , the alfvn velocity inside the ribbon is more than two times bigger than the co - rotation velocity at io . the corresponding time scale is more than two times smaller than the corresponding dynamical time scale which is enough to explain the observed the lack of correlation .",
    "further investigation of its implication on the euv emission processes is warranted [ barbosa , coroniti , and eviatar 1983a ] ."
