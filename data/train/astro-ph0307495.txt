    "one of the major highlights of the iras mission was the discovery of the ` vega - excess ' phenomenon exhibited by a number of main - sequence stars ( aumann et al .",
    "1984 ) , i.e. emission in excess over the stellar photospheric value at long wavelengths ( @xmath410@xmath5 m ) . already from the very beginning",
    "it was recognised that this excess is re - emitted stellar radiation by a surrounding cloud of dust particles . the image of the southern vega - excess star @xmath0  in the optical by smith & terrile ( 1984 ) confirmed the earlier notion that the spatial distribution of the dust is highly flattened , i.e. in a disk shaped configuration rather than in a spheroidal cloud .",
    "recent reviews of @xmath0  and similar systems - the dusty debris disks - include those by artymowicz ( 2000 ) , lagrange et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and zuckerman ( 2001 ) .",
    "besides vega ( @xmath6lyr ) and @xmath0 , other prominent members of the class are fomalhaut ( @xmath6psa ) , @xmath7  and hr4796a .",
    "the excess emission of these objects seems to outline an evolutionary trend ( spangler et al .",
    "2001 , fig.1 ) , in the sense that the amount of _ emitting _ particulate matter in a given object declines with time .",
    "yet younger objects would occupy the upper left corner of the diagram ( with considerable spread due to increasing optical depth ) and it seems reasonable to assume that the dusty debris disks ( somehow ) are linked to those of the pre - main - sequence ( pms ) phase .",
    "pms - disks , with ages @xmath810myr , are essentially gaseous and are believed to provide the material necessary for the formation of planetary systems @xcite . observed asymmetries and inhomogeneties in the dust emission from debris disks have been taken to provide evidence for dynamical signatures of disk - planet interaction , ( e.g. , ozernoy et al .",
    "2000 , augereau et al .",
    "2001 , wyatt & dent 2002 , kuchner & holman 2003 ) .",
    "our knowledge regarding the incidence of _ known _ planets ( gas giants ) around debris disk stars is very limited .",
    "heavy observational bias is at work here , though .",
    "radial - velocity studies are biased toward relatively late spectral types , whereas the most prominent debris disk stars are of earlier spectral types . in addition",
    ", radial - velocity studies have focused on fairly old stars , whereas disks around stars much older than about 400myr would generally not have been picked up in the iras survey @xcite .",
    "three planetary systems , discovered with the radial - velocity technique , have been claimed by trilling et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to possess dust disks .",
    "the observational evidence presented by jayawardhana et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( see also schneider et al .",
    "2001 ) argues strongly against any substantial amounts of dust around 55cnc , whereas the other two systems , viz . @xmath9crb and hd210277 ,",
    "still need confirmation .",
    "pantin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported the detection of a circumstellar disk around @xmath10hor .",
    "however , this result has not yet been published in a refereed journal .",
    "the _ circumstantial _ evidence for planet(s ) around dusty debris stars is enormous . to give just a few examples , the case for vega",
    "has been presented by wilner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , for fomalhaut by holland et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and for @xmath0  by wahhaj et al .",
    "for the chromospherically active star @xmath7 , hatzes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) presented a rather noisy radial velocity curve ( for more recent data , see http://exoplanets.org/esp/epseri/epseri.shtml ) and the confirmation of the planet(s ) would need a longer baseline in time .",
    "if the evolutionary hypothesis is correct , then a similar apparent decrease in the gas content may be expected and one could hope to find objects being currently in a transitional phase between gas - rich pms- and gas - poor debris disks .",
    "this could open up the possibility to directly witness the end phases of planet formation and the early stages of planetary system evolution .",
    "appreciable amounts of gas could still be present in these systems .",
    "alternatively , in older systems , where the dust debris is most likely of more recent origin , the study of the dust production mechanism(s ) could benefit from complementing observations of the accompanying gaseous components , as for example in the case of solar system comets @xcite .",
    "in either of these scenarios , the detection of sharp spectral features originating from the gas would permit the direct observational study of the disk kinematics and provide input to theoretical models of the debris disk dynamics .",
    "recalling that the discoveries were made at iras wavelengths , it was clear already from the very beginning that the emitting dust grains had to be at relatively low temperatures ( a few tens to some hundred kelvin ) .",
    "the emission being optically thin , these observations led directly to estimates of the total amount of dust ( particle sizes @xmath8@xmath11 ) in these systems @xcite . disregarding for a moment the many details which in reality enter these estimations such as , e.g. , the correct description of the dust absorption coefficient(s ) @xcite - the mass is inversely proportional to this quantity - inferred lower limits to the dust mass are some fraction to some tens of a lunar mass ( @xmath12 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the minimum mass solar nebula amounts to roughly @xmath13@xmath12 , from which it is clear that , for any reasonable assumption about the local gas - to - dust mass ratio , any solar system type of planet formation must have been completed by the vega excess stage .    if the gas - to - dust mass ratio in these systems were comparable to that of the interstellar medium ( ism , @xmath14160 ) , detectable amounts of ( primarily molecular ) gas could be expected .",
    "in fact , carbon monoxide ( co ) has frequently been observed through disk absorption against the ultraviolet stellar continuum of @xmath0  ( roberge et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) . in an optical absorption study ,",
    "hobbs et al . ( 1985 ) put an upper limit on the amount of ch@xmath15 in the @xmath0  disk .",
    "emission line studies , mostly in the sub-/millimeter regime , have so far been essentially unsuccessful ( liseau 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "molecules searched for in emission include co , cs , sio and hco@xmath15 from the gound and h@xmath3o  and o@xmath16 ( the swas team ) from space .",
    "in addition , the detection of rotational h@xmath3  emission in the mid - infrared ( iso - sws ) from @xmath0  has been reported @xcite , with an estimate of the total mass of the order of 50@xmath17 .",
    "however , lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) were unable to confirm these amounts of h@xmath3  through absorption measurements in the far ultraviolet ( fuse ) and the matter seems at present inconclusive ( but see below , sect.3.1.2 ) .",
    "various explanations have been offered to explain the observed low levels of molecular concentration in dusty debris disks , particularly what regards co , being ubiquitous in the ism and in solar system comets .",
    "these include ` abnormally ' low gas - to - dust mass ratios , ` abnormally ' low _ gas _ phase co abundances ( relative to h@xmath3 ) , photodissociation of co and , simply , non - existence ( early dissipation through stellar wind and/or consumption during planet building ) .",
    "none of these explanations is flawless and the resolution of this issue will have to await future observational and theoretical improvements .",
    "observational studies of atomic gas , either ionised or neutral , in dusty debris disks have traditionally focused on line _ absorption _ in a very limited number of objects .",
    "although very sensitive to column densities , these studies are generally incapable of pin - pointing the regions of line absorption along the line of sight . in the following ,",
    "a number of observational studies are discussed , which were aiming at the detection of _ emission _ from atomic gas .",
    "the by - far best studied object among the dusty debris disks is the @xmath0  system .",
    "the attempt to directly measure , through 21 cm line emission , the amount of atomic hydrogen gas was unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "the presence of widespread ionised hydrogen in the disk is not expected and balmer line emission has not been detected @xcite .",
    "observations with the iso - lws may have detected feeble [ cii]157@xmath5 m  emission toward @xmath0   @xcite .",
    "few details about the circumstellar disk could be learned from these spatially and spectrally under - resolved observations , though .",
    "the resolution issue was greatly improved upon by using a large optical telescope , equipped with an echelle spectrograph and a long slit , leading to the discovery of widespread sodium gas in the disk @xcite .",
    "these observations provided finally conclusive evidence that the star @xmath0  is indeed surrounded by a disk in keplerian rotation , seen nearly edge - on ( fig.2 ) .",
    "follow - up observations @xcite covered the optical spectrum ( 0.3 to 1.1@xmath5 m ) at greater resolving power and , in particular , covered a larger area with the spectrograph slit positioned both along and perpendicularly to the disk - midplane ( figs.2 and 3 ) .",
    "projected slit widths were 6au and slit lengths 154au , covering the disk out to 300au in both the northeast ( ne ) and southwest ( sw ) parts of the disk .",
    "perpendicular slits were positioned at approximately 60au and 120au on both sides from the star , extending to 80au on either side of the midplane ( fig.3 ) .",
    "nearly 80 emission lines from the disk were detected , all from non - volatile elements including caii , cri+ii , fei , nai , nii+ii , tii+ii .",
    "in addition , a dozen lines lack so far a clear identification .",
    "neutral iron , with more than 50 strong lines , dominates the disk spectrum .",
    "measurements of the line emission along the perpendicular slits revealed that the gas disk is not perfectly plane ( fig.4 ) . inside @xmath18@xmath19 , the disk appears tilted at an angle of about 5@xmath20 , very much the same as inferred for the dust disk by heap et al .",
    "further out , the gas disk is flaring at an opening angle of about 10@xmath20  ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the two disk halves display significant asymmetries and small scale structure in their line emission , as illustrated by naid@xmath16 in fig.5 .",
    "the ne disk extends much farther out , in fact to the limit of our observations ( cf .",
    "fig.2 ) . in contrast ,",
    "further in , the sw side is brighter .",
    "these features can also be discerned in the dust disk , albeit at lower contrast @xcite .      as a complete surprise came the observed small velocity dispersion of the line emission from the atomic disk @xcite . in the absence of a major component of volatile gases",
    ", an excess of some hundred of kms@xmath22  over the local keplerian value of the radial velocity would be expected due to radiation pressure on the neutral sodium atoms . as different species",
    "will be differently sensitive to radiation pressure , their spectral lines should exhibit different widths .",
