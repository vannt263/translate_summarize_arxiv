    "the two - dimensional(2d ) fully frustrated xy ( ffxy)-model describes a 2d josephson junction array in a perpendicular magnetic field with the strength of the magnetic field corresponding to one magnetic flux quanta for every second plaquette of the array . the phase transitions of this model on a square lattice have been the subject of a long controversy@xcite@xmath4@xcite.the emerging canonical picture is that the model has two relevant phase ordering symmetries : an angular @xmath5-symmetry and a @xmath0-chirality symmetry @xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath6@xcite . as a consequence , the model has often been assumed to belong within the designation @xmath7 @xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath6@xcite .",
    "the controversial questions have been : does the model undergo a single combined transition or two separate transitions and , if the latter , in which order do the transitions occur ?",
    "the emerging consensus is two separate transitions : as the temperature is increased first a kosterlitz - thouless(kt ) transition associated with the angular @xmath5- symmetry and then at a slightly higher temperature a @xmath0-chirality transition @xcite@xmath6@xcite .",
    "the cause of the controversy can , retrospectively , be attributed to the fact that the two transitions are extremely close in temperature .",
    "we here generalize the 2d ffxy model into a a wider 2d ffxy - class of models by changing the nearest neighbor interaction in such a way as to keep all symmetries .",
    "this generalized 2d ffxy - class is shown to contain an additional groundstate .",
    "the existence of this additional grounstate leads to a phase diagram containing four sectors.@xcite .",
    "we here show that it has seven different phase transitions lines and four multicritical points .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to establish the characters of the transitions of this phase diagram .",
    "our simulations suggest that three of the critical points are consistent with the central charge @xmath2 and one with @xmath3 .    in section 2",
    "we define the 2d ffxy - model and in section 3 we describe the structure of the new ground state . in section 4 we propose an order parameter associated with the transition into this new groundstate . in section 5",
    "we give the results for the various phase transitions obtained from monte carlo simulations and determine the character of the four multicritical points by invoking a relation between the central charge @xmath8 and the bulk critical indices . in section 6",
    "we discuss the original 2d ffxy  model in view of our results .",
    "we also comment on related models not contained within the class of fully frustrated xy  model discussed in the present investigation .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
    "the hamiltonian which defines the 2d fully frustrated xy - class models on an @xmath9 square lattice is given by    @xmath10    with @xmath11 $ ] , where the sum is over nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "the phase angle @xmath12 for the @xmath13th site at the lattice point @xmath14 satisfies the periodicity @xmath15 .",
    "the magnetic bond angle @xmath16 is defined as the line integral along the link from @xmath13 to @xmath17 , i.e.@xmath18 with the magnetic vector potential @xmath19 for the uniform magnetic field @xmath20 in the @xmath21 direction . with",
    "the landau gauge taken , @xmath22 for the vertical link and @xmath23 for the horizontal one , where the frustration parameter @xmath24 measures the average number of flux quanta per plaquette .",

    "the boltzmann factor , which determines the thermodynamic properties , is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the temperature .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath28 is periodic in @xmath29 and is quadratic to lowest order in @xmath30 so that @xmath31 .",
    "these conditions for the interaction potential defines the class : the members of this class are distinguished by the explicit form of the interaction potential @xmath32 .",
    "if the relevant symmetry class is @xmath7 , then in principle three transitions are possible : separate @xmath5 and @xmath33 transitions or a merged @xmath7 transition . however , the number of allowed phase transitions for the ffxy - class is much larger@xcite . _",
    "the implication is that by just changing the specific form of @xmath32 within the ffxy - class one could encounter a plethora of phase transitions_. in order to verify this , we choose a parametrization of @xmath32 and find the phase transitions corresponding to this parametrization using monte carlo simulations techniques .",

    "let us first consider the groundstate for the standard 2d ffxy model on a square lattice : the spin configuration corresponding to the groundstate checkerboard is given in fig .",
    "2a.@xcite a square with ( without ) a flux quanta is denoted by @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the arrows give the spin directions and the thick ( thin ) links are the links with ( without ) magnetic bond angles @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) modulo @xmath29 . in this configuration",
    "all the links contribute the same energy @xmath53 to the groundstate .",
    "thus the energy for the four links constituting an elementary square is in this configuration @xmath54 .",
    "the broken symmetry of the free energy is for @xmath55 directly related to the fact that in order to change @xmath49 to @xmath50 squares in fig .",
    "2a by continuously turning the spin directions from the one groundstate to the other , an increase of the energy is required by a finite amount for a number of links .",
    "this required number of links goes to infinity with the size of the system : the two groundstates are separated by an infinite energy barrier in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the crucial point in the present context is that the groundstate shown in fig .",
    "2a does not remain the groundstate for all values @xmath37 . as @xmath37 is increased , the maximum link energy @xmath56 decreases and at a particular value @xmath57 the groundstate switches to the spin configuration shown in fig .",
    "the energy for the links around a square is for this configuration given by @xmath58 .",
    "the critical value @xmath59 is hence given by the condition @xmath60 leading to the determination @xmath61    the groundstate for @xmath62 shown in fig .",
    "2b has the property that an infinitesimal change of the middle spin is enough to flip between the two checkerboard patterns ( switching between @xmath49 and @xmath50 in fig .",
    "thus there is no barrier between these two checkerboard patterns for @xmath62 .",
    "this means that the broken symmetry of the free energy associated with the two possible checkerboard patterns states is restored .",
    "however , there is a new infinite barrier between the two degenerate groundstates on opposite sides of @xmath59 : continuously turning the spins to change from the spin - configuration in fig .",
    "2a to the spin - configuration in fig .",
    "2b requires an infinite energy .",
    "in order to characterize the phase transition properties of the 2d gffxy model one needs to identify a set of order parameters with which all possible transitions can be characterized :     plane . the staggered magnetization @xmath63 and the helicity modulus @xmath64 give us all four combinations , all of which are realized in the phase diagram .",
    "the horizontal dotted line at @xmath35 corresponds to the standard ffxy model which has two distinct , extremely close transitions . ]    the checkerboard pattern is usually associated with a @xmath0 chirality symmetry . for @xmath55 this symmetry",
    "is reflected in the existence of two degenerate groundstates ( the two checkerboards ) separated by an infinite energy barrier .",
    "the corresponding order parameter is related to the staggered magnetization @xmath63 defined as  @xcite    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the ensemble average and the vorticity for the @xmath67th elementary plaquette at @xmath68 is computed from @xmath69 with the sum taken anti - clockwise around the given plaquette .",
    "the corresponding broken symmetry is reflected in the following way : for any finite system the quantity @xmath70 can with finite probability acquire any value in the range @xmath71 $ ] allowed by the model .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath72 only values in either the range @xmath73 $ ] or the range @xmath74 $ ] can be acquired .",
    "this means that the order parameter @xmath75 in the tthermodynamiclimit only can take on the two values @xmath76 .",
    "the probability for the two values are equal but they are separated by an infinite free - energy barrier .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the order parameter @xmath77 has a @xmath0 symmetry which is broken . in the broken symmetry region @xmath78 whereas when the symmetry is unbroken @xmath79 .",
    "figure 3 shows the phase diagram in the @xmath80-plane .",
    "as seen @xmath78 corresponds to a finite region of this plane .    for @xmath55 and @xmath81 , the two groundstates in fig .",
    "2a and b are degenerate and separated by an infinite energy barrier .",
    "for @xmath82 this should instead take the form of an infinite free energy barrier in the thermodynamic limit , separating values which a local order parameter can acquire .",
    "to this end one needs to identify an appropriate local order parameter .",
    "such a possible order parameter is the defect density @xmath83 defined by    @xmath84    where the square lattice has been divided into @xmath85squares numerated by @xmath86 where each consists of four elementary plaquettes . here",
    "@xmath87 is the sum of the phase difference around a four - plaquette @xmath88 which means that @xmath89 can be @xmath90 or @xmath91 thus the defect density can be described in the following way : think of the elementary plaquettes as being either black ( @xmath92 ) or white ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "there are always equally many black and white squares .",
    "the defect density measures the average difference in the number of white and black squares contained in a four - plaquette .",
    "obviously the checkerboard groundstate corresponds to a zero defect density @xmath94 .",
    "however , for a finite temperature the checkerboard groundstate may contain a kink . this situation is illustrated in fig .  4 :",
    "start from a checkerboard pattern .",
    "the thick dotted line is a boundary between the two possible checkerboard patterns .",
    "the 90 degree turn of this line is associated with a four - plaquette with @xmath95 which is denoted as thick solid line surrounding four plaquettes in fig .",
    "thus a kink corresponds to a defect with @xmath96 according to our definition .",
    "the defect density defined here can be regarded as a generalization of the kink concept , since it does not rest on the possibility of uniquely identifying domain boundaries .",
    "thus the defect density remains a well defined concept even when the checkerboard symmetry is completely restored and @xmath79 .",
    "the groundstate shown in fig .",
    "2b is an example of a situation when @xmath79 , because switching between + and - in fig .",
    "2b does not involve passing any energy barrier .",
    "thus the defect density remains finite as @xmath27 is lowered towards zero for any @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , the groundstate in fig .",
    "2b corresponds to a finite defect density @xmath98 .",
    "it is also obvious that the defect density is monotonously increasing with @xmath27 .",
    "is measured by eq .",
    "( 5 ) . for the four plaquettes surrounded by thick full line , @xmath99 whereas all other four plaquettes have even number of vortices and thus @xmath100 . ]    a phase transition associated with this order parameter is signaled by either a discontinuous or a non - analytical behavior of @xmath83 as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath37 .",
    "the defect density makes a ddiscontinuousjump from zero to a finite value at @xmath59 in the limit of small temperatures and these two values are separated by an infinite energy barrier : the point @xmath101 is the starting point of a phase transition line ( see fig.3 ) . on this phase transition line",
    "the order parameter @xmath83 can only take on two values .",
    "these two values are equally probable but are separated by an infinite free energy barrier .",
    "thus the order parameter @xmath83 on this phase transition line possesses a @xmath0 symmetry which is broken .",
    "one should note that in case of @xmath83 the infinite free energy barrier between two different but equally probable values of @xmath83 only resides on well defined lines in the @xmath102-plane , whereas the infinite barrier for the chirality transition resides on an area of the @xmath102-plane ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "thus the phase transition associated with the defect density @xmath83 is more akin to a liquid - gas transition in the pressure temperature plane : the order parameter is the density difference on the two sides of the transition line and the infinite free energy barrier only exists precisely on the transition line .",
    "the @xmath5-symmetry is in 2d at most `` quasi '' broken because of the mermin - wagner theorem@xcite . as a consequence",
    "the corresponding phase transitions can not be described by a local order parameter .",
    "instead the phase transitions can be monitored by the increase of the free energy caused by a uniform twist @xmath103 of the spin angles across the system .",
    "expanding the free energy @xmath104 for small values of @xmath103 to lowest orders gives @xmath105 here , @xmath64 is the helicity modulus .",
    "it is finite in the low - temperature phase and zero in the high - temperature phase.@xcite @xmath106 is the fourth order modulus and can be used to verify that the helicity modulus @xmath64 makes a discontinuous jump to zero at the transition.@xcite this discontinuous jump is a key characteristics of the kt - transition.@xcite@xmath6@xcite",
    "in ref .  @xcite the phase transitions associated with the @xmath5-symmetry and the @xmath0-chirality symmetry were investigated .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is reproduced in fig .",
    "3 . this phase diagram has four sectors corresponding to all four possible combinations of transitions for a combined symmetry @xmath7 : the four sectors are characterized by the four possible combinations @xmath107 . the dashed horizontal line at @xmath35 in fig",

    "the phase @xmath108 is not realized @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we use all the three order parameters described in the previous section together with monte carlo simulations in order to deduce the nature of the various phase boundaries .",
    "( compare with fig .",
    "there are in total four multicritical points termed a , b , c , d(see text ) .",

    "5 gives a sketch of the resulting `` horizontal '' phase boundary in fig .",
    "3 . in this",
    "blown up scale one finds that it has one maximum and one minimum , as well as three multicritical points ending three distinct phase lines .",
    "the critical points are denoted by @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "a fourth multicritical point is found along the `` vertical '' phase line at much higher @xmath37 and lower @xmath27 ( see figs.3 and 5 ) .",
    "let us first consider the phase boundary from @xmath55 to the critical point @xmath112 .",
    "across this first section of the phase boundary the phase transition associated with the defect density @xmath83 is first order .",
    "6a illustrates the discontinuous change in the defect density @xmath83 .",
    "the defect - density histogram along this phase line has two distinct values of equal probability which remain distinct in the large @xmath113-limit .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "6b : for a given temperature @xmath27 , the lower value corresponds to the low-@xmath37 phase and the higher to the high-@xmath37 phase . as pointed out above",
    ", this is aanalogousto the density for a liquid - gas transition .",
    "note that for @xmath114 the @xmath37-value for the first order line is lower than @xmath115 .",
    "however , as @xmath27 is further increased , the @xmath37-value for the first order line increases .",
    "finally , at a critical temperature @xmath116 the density difference vanishes with increasing system size .",
    "this is the signature of the critical point @xmath112 which is hence the critical point ending the first order transition line for the defect - density .",
    "thus the critical point @xmath112 is analogous to the critical point ending the first order line for a gas - liquid transition .",
    "6c shows the defect - density histogram close to the critical point : at the critical point the free energy barrier between the two phases is @xmath113-independent . to good approximation",
    "this means that the ratio between the maximum and minimum in the kink - density histogram should be size - independent , whereas it increases ( decreases ) for lower ( higher ) temperatures @xcite .",
    "this condition is fulfilled to good approximation for the @xmath27-value in fig .",
    "at the critical point the defect - density difference @xmath117 ( the difference between the two maxima in fig .",

    "the @xmath119 size scaling is shown in fig .",
    "6d and is consistent with an exponent @xmath120 .",
    "one can express this exponent in terms of the central charge @xmath8 as @xmath121 @xcite@xmath6@xcite .",
    "the central charge @xmath8 is coupled to the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the defect density , the staggered magnetization and the magnetization for the 2d ising model can all aacquireprecisely two distinct values with equal probability separated by an infinite energy barrier .",
    "the broken symmetry reflected by these order parameters does hence have a @xmath0-character and the phase transitions are ising like .",
    "the central charge is @xmath122 for 2d ising like transitions .",
    "if the order parameter on the other hand is a 2d vector then the symmetry is @xmath123 ( which means that the order parameter with equal probability have the same magnitude and any direction , but that all these possibilities are separated by an infinite energy barrier ) then the central charge is @xmath3 .",
    "provided that our three order parameters covers all possibilities , then a phase transition can _ a priori _ be any combination of single and joint transitions involving these order parameters and is hence contained within the designation @xmath124 .",
    "these implies that the central charge can have the four values @xmath122 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 . here",
    "a @xmath0-transition corresponds to @xmath122 , an individual kt - transition or a combined @xmath128 transition corresponds to @xmath3 , the two possible combined @xmath129-transitions correspond to @xmath2 , and a combined @xmath124 corresponds to @xmath130 .",

    "@xcite the values of @xmath163 and @xmath8 were independently determined and given by @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "thus the apparent multicritical point for the usual ffxy model appeared to have critical properties inconsistent with a single @xmath0-transition and with critical @xmath163-values in between a single @xmath0-transition and the real @xmath167 multicritical point c for the 2d ffxy class .",
    "furthermore , the closeness of the @xmath163-values and @xmath8-values ( @xmath168 and @xmath160 for c , respectively , @xmath165 and @xmath166 obtained for the usual ffxy model in ref.@xcite ) suggests that the putative multicritical point found for the 2d ffxy model is an artifact of the closeness to the real critical point c for the 2d ffxy class .",
    "the present consensus is that the 2d ffxy  model undergoes two separate transition , a kt  transition at @xmath169 followed by a @xmath0-transition at @xmath170 with @xmath171.@xcite in particular korshunov in ref .",
    "@xcite has given a general argument which purportedly states that @xmath171 should be true not only for the 2d ffxy model , but also for the 2d ffxy class studied in the present work , provided that the interaction is such that its groundstate is the broken symmetry checkerboard state .",
    "this is in contradiction with the existence of the multicritical point c at @xmath172 ( compare fig.5 ) which does correspond to an interaction potential with a checkerboard groundstate .",
    "we suggest that the reason for this fallacy of the argument is connected to the closeness to the ( @xmath63,@xmath64)@xmath173(0,@xmath1740)-phase .",
    "the most striking feature of the phase transition for 2d ffxy model is the closeness between @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the phase diagram in fig .",
    "5 gives a scenario for which this feature becomes less surprising : the point is that the chirality transition and the kt - transition merge and cross as a function of @xmath37 for the 2d gffxy model .",
    "it then becomes more natural that , for some values of @xmath37 , the transitions can be extremely close .",
    "the value @xmath35 , which corresponds to the usual ffxy model happens to be such a value .",
    "there are many other @xmath7-models related to the 2d ffxy model@xcite .",
    "although , our results only pertain to the 2d ffxy - class defined in this paper , we note that , to our knowledge , none of the phase diagrams for related models contain a crossing of the kt and an ising - like transition . in a vast majority ,",
    "the kt - transition is always at lower temperature than the ising - like transition or possibly merged .",
    "however , in the model in ref .",
    "@xcite the situation is reversed with the ising - like transition below or merging with the kt - transition .",
    "also in this case a crossing is lacking .",
    "because there is no crossing it is notoriously difficult assert whether a merging takes place or whether the two transitions are only extremely close.@xcite for example the ising - xy model was in refs @xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath6@xcite found to contain such a line of merged transitions .",
    "however , more careful mc simulations in fact suggest that the transitions are extremely close but never merge along this line.@xcite the point to note is that for our 2d gffxy - model the transitions _ cross _ from which directly follows that a real merging exists in this case .",
    "we believe that this crossing is intimately related to the appearance of the additional groundstate .",
    "to sum up , we have found that the description of the phase diagram for the 2d ffxy - class of models requires at least three distinct order parameters consistent with the proposed designation @xmath175 : in addition to the usual kt @xmath5 transition and the chirality @xmath0-transition , there is also a defect - density transition with ising like @xmath0-character . within our simple parametrization of the interaction @xmath32",
    ", we have found that all combinations of transitions can be realized except two : the single @xmath0-defect transition and the fully combined @xmath124-transition .",
    "all the others are realized , i.e. the single @xmath0-chirality transition , the single @xmath5-kt transition , the combined @xmath0-defect and @xmath0-chirality transition , the combined @xmath0-chirality and @xmath5-kt , and the combined @xmath0-defect and the @xmath5-kt transition .",
    "since the gffxy - model is a subclass of the 2d ffxy - class this means that at least five of the symmetry allowed transitions can be realized .",
    "what about the remaining two ? here",
    "we speculate that a single @xmath0 -density transition will hardly be realized because it couples too strongly to the other transitions .",
    "however , one might imagine that there exists a potential @xmath32 for which the two nearby critical points @xmath112 and @xmath151 are merged .",
    "this critical point would then correspond to a merged @xmath124-transition with central charge @xmath130 .",
    "we also note that cristofano et al in ref .",
    "@xcite , argued from general symmetry considerations that the full symmetry of the ffxy - model allows for @xmath176 .",
    "the present results for the phase diagram of the 2d gffxy model supports this designation .",
