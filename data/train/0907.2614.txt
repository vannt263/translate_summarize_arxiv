    "the chapter on two - electron atoms or ions is of great importance when teaching quantum mechanics , and usually the opportunity of a transition from simple binary systems to more complicated structures , with examples of application of perturbation theory and variational methods .",
    "historically , understanding the two - electrons atoms was crucial to demonstrate that the theory of quanta was not just an ansatz that works fortuitously for the case of the hydrogen atom . indeed , while the bohr ",
    "sommerfeld quantization method accounts efficiently for the one - electron atoms , it first faced serious difficulties for the description of helium . then heisenberg@xcite and other pioneers ( for refs . , see , e.g. , the book by bethe and salpeter@xcite ) showed that the helium atom can be well described in the framework of the new quantum mechanics .",
    "however , binding two electrons to a helium nucleus or a heavier nucleus with charge @xmath0 is rather obvious , as the first attached electron leaves a positively - charged kernel that easily traps the second electron .",
    "the problem here is to calculate approximately the energy spectrum and the associated wave functions and not to demonstrate the existence of bound states .",
    "it is thus unfortunate that many textbooks , even among the best ones , are restricted to the case of helium and do not discuss the more challenging case of @xmath1 , i.e. , the negative hydrogen ion .",
    "noticeable exceptions are refs .  .",
    "the negative hydrogen ion , , enters a variety of physical , chemical , biological and geological processes.@xcite in astrophysics , it plays a role at sun s surface , and its absorption and emission properties have been studied by chandrasekhar in a series of papers.@xcite in some laboratories , there are nowadays beams of . intense beams of  are foreseen for future nuclear - fusion devices.@xcite when teaching few - body quantum mechanics , it is the simplest prototype of fragile structure , at the edge between binding and non - binding , which can not be described by simple tools such as hartree wave - functions , however efficient are these methods to account for the properties of well - bound systems .",
    "other examples are atomic clusters made of noble - gas atoms , or borromean nuclei with two weakly - bound peripheral neutrons .",
    "intimately related to  is the positronium molecule @xmath4 predicted in 1945 by wheeler@xcite and discovered only recently.@xcite demonstrating its stability against dissociation into two positronium atoms can be done with a generalization of the chandrasekhar wave function , though the calculation becomes slightly more intricate .",
    "this molecule has many symmetries .",
    "it can be seen that breaking particle identity and breaking charge conjugation have dramatically different effects on its stability . in the former case",
    ", it quickly disappears , while it the later case , it is reinforced .",
    "in particular , the stability of the hydrogen molecule can be ",
    "somewhat paradoxically  demonstrated as a consequence of the stability of the positronium molecule .",
    "this is of course at variance with the more physical starting point of two infinitely massive protons , but illustrates the importance of symmetry breaking which enters many other fields of physics .",
    "this paper is aimed at reviewing what can be taught on the quantum mechanics of the two - electron atoms and molecules at the elementary or more advanced level .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ two - at - gs ] with the ground state of two - electron atoms and ions , which is a spin - singlet configuration .",
    "the easiest case of a central charge @xmath0 is briefly reviewed , before discussing the case of the hydrogen ion with @xmath1 .",
    "we focus on the beautiful solution proposed by chandrasekhar,@xcite which is a mere product of single - electron wave functions with _ different _ range parameters , supplemented by a counter - term in which the two electrons are interchanged , so that the overall permutation symmetry is restored .",
    "two other levels of helium - like systems are presented in sec .",

    "[ two - mol ] , the case of the positronium molecule is presented , as well as some of its less symmetric variants . after a brief summary is in sec .",
    "[ se : concl ] , some details about the calculation of the matrix elements are given in appendix .",
    "we consider first the non - relativistic hamiltonian describing two electrons of mass @xmath5 and charge @xmath6 around a fixed charged @xmath7 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the coulomb problem has very simple scaling properties : the energies are proportional to @xmath10 and the distances to @xmath11 .",
    "we shall give all results in natural units which correspond to treating ( [ eq : h ] ) as if @xmath12 .",
    "the orbital wave function should be antisymmetric for a spin triplet , and symmetric for a spin singlet , as the ground state we shall consider first .",
    "the case of @xmath13 is treated in most textbooks .",
    "hence we shall give only a minimal review , for the sake of completeness .",
    "if the last term of ( [ eq : h ] ) is omitted , the hamiltonian is exactly solvable , and for the ground state , the unperturbed energy is @xmath14 and the wave function @xmath15 $ ] . to first order ,",
    "the energy is approximated and upper bounded by @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the variational energy corresponding to the trial wave function @xmath18 ) .",
    "the matrix element @xmath19 is routinely estimated by a partial - wave expansion .",
    "it is sufficient , as done , e.g. , by peebles,@xcite to evoke the gauss theorem , which states that the potential created at distance @xmath20 by a spherical shell @xmath21 of radius @xmath22 is @xmath23 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 if @xmath26 .",

    "however , it is easily checked that this approach requires @xmath32 to bind two electrons .",
    "an easy and pedagogically instructive improvement consists of replacing @xmath33 by @xmath34~,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a variational parameter , whose value measures the effective charge seen by each electron .",

    "is demonstrated only for @xmath40 .",
    "thus @xmath1 requires another treatment , as described in the following section .",
    "variational wave functions that bind  have been written down by bethe , hylleraas and several others .",
    "see , e.g. , the book by bethe and salpeter.@xcite for instance , a correlation factor @xmath41 or @xmath42 can be inserted into the wave function  ( [ eq : eff - q ] ) .",
    "the most elegant solution is perhaps that of chandrasekhar,@xcite which reads ( unnormalized ) @xmath43 where the permutation symmetry is explicitly broken by @xmath44 and restored by the second term .",
    "as compared to the standard shell - model wave function ( [ eq : eff - q ] ) , sometimes labelled @xmath45 , this wave - function is named `` unrestricted '' by goddard@xcite who gives a generalization .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath46 involve the same basic integrals as for the simpler wave function @xmath47 , and it is straightforward to derive , for the kinetic ( @xmath48 ) and potential ( @xmath49 ) energy and for the normalization ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 where the attractive terms ( proportional to @xmath52 ) are supplemented by the contribution from @xmath53 .",
    "as  is weakly bound , the physical picture is that of one electron far away , and the other one near the nucleus , feeling an almost unscreened coulomb potential .",
    "this suggests the following approximation : one freezes out @xmath54 , i.e. , assumes that one of the electrons is unperturbed , and varies @xmath55 , to get a first minimum @xmath56 that already establishes binding !",
    "this minimum is reached for @xmath57 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : chandra ] , dashed curve .",

    "the symmetric part where @xmath69 is not shown.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the task of minimizing @xmath58 or any similar variational energy can be simplified by using the virial theorem , which also holds for the best variational solution , with the mild restriction that the set of trial functions is globally invariant under rescaling .",
    "this was noticed very early.@xcite see , also , refs .  . a simple derivation of the virial theorem consists , indeed , to impose that in a rescaling @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of internal variables and the factor keeps the normalization , the expectation value of the hamiltonian remains stationary near @xmath72 .",
    "this obviously works for both the exact solution or the best variational approximation in a given set .",
    "for instance , in the case of the chandrasekhar wave function , one can set @xmath73 , @xmath74 . for given @xmath75 , the minimization over the overall scale @xmath76 fixes the proper balance of kinetic and potential energy , as required by the virial theorem .",
    "one is left with minimizing @xmath77 over the single variable @xmath75 , to recover the minimum at @xmath78 , as shown in fig .",

    "another challenging problem deals with states of unnatural parity .",
    "consider again the @xmath110 system , though similar considerations could be developed in the four - body case . if one neglects the spins and intrinsic parities , the ground state has angular momentum and parity @xmath111 .",

    "one needs a superposition , say @xmath122 for a given set of range parameters @xmath123 , the coefficients @xmath124 , and the resulting energy are given by a generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "then the range parameters can be adjusted by standard techniques , if the number of terms is limited .",
    "if this number increases , special care is required , to avoid numerical instabilities . to simplify the minimization",
    ", one can extract the range parameters @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 from an arithmetic series @xmath128 , allowing the possibility of equal values , e.g. , @xmath129 .",

    "this confirms the conclusion by mills , who found this state unbound.@xcite",

    "this energy has been much lowered by more and more sophisticated computations , @xcite to reach about @xmath148 .",
    "it was later realized that there are excited states , whose threshold is higher than two positronium atoms in the ground state , due to selection rules ; for refs . ,",
    "see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "an indirect experimental evidence for the ps@xmath139 molecule was reported recently,@xcite 62 years after its prediction !      once the positronium molecule is shown to be stable , one might study what happens for other mass configurations .",
    "though the hydrogen molecule @xmath149 is better described from the large @xmath3 limit , i.e. , the born ",
    "oppenheimer approximation , it is amazing that its stability can be understood from the @xmath150 limit .",
    "it is also rather instructive to study whether or not symmetry breaking does improve binding .    indeed , a system @xmath151 , i.e. , any rescaled version of ps@xmath139 , has many symmetries : exchange of the positive or the negative particles , and overall charge conjugation .",
    "consider first a breaking of permutation symmetry , for simplicity , identically in the positive and the negative sectors , keeping the average inverse mass @xmath152 constant .",
    "this corresponds to writing the hamiltonian as@xcite @xmath153 the second term decreases the energy of the molecule .",
    "however , the same effect is observed as for the three - body ion : the threshold decreases more substantially , benefitting from the property of two - body energies @xmath154 detailed numerical studies have shown that stability is lost for @xmath155 ( or @xmath156)@xcite .",
    "if , instead , charge conjugation is broken , i.e. , if the mass configuration becomes @xmath157{m^-,}m^-)$ ] , the decomposition reads @xmath158 and again the four - body ground - state energy is lowered by the second term .",
    "now , the threshold remains constant , at @xmath159 and thus the stability is improved .",
    "indeed , the hydrogen molecule is bound by about 17% below the atom  atom threshold , whilst this is only about 3% for the positronium molecule .",
    "we briefly reviewed how the stability of the ground state of , and the lowest spin - triplet state of helium can be reached with rather simple wave functions , whose matrix elements can be estimated by straightforward calculus . a more delicate  and less advertised ",
    "problem is that of the stability of the unnatural parity states , which forces one to push further the variational expansion , in order to demonstrate binding .",
    "the main message is that the hartree  fock method ,",
    "i.e. , a factorized wave functions with suitable ( anti- ) symmetrization is extremely efficient for deeply - bound systems , but fails for demonstrating the binding of states at the edge between stability and spontaneous dissociation .",
    "this is also observed in nuclear physics : halo nuclei with a weakly bound external neutron and the borromean nuclei with two external neutrons , require a dedicated treatment ( a borromean 3-body system is bound while its subsystem are unstable .",
    "for instance , @xmath160 and @xmath161 are not bound , but @xmath162 is stable against any dissociation and only rely on @xmath130 decay to disintegrate . ) .    the strategy initiated by hylleraas , chandrasekhar and others",
    "consists of using a basis of functions where each term breaks permutation symmetry .",
    "the proper boson or fermion statistics is restored by superposing terms deduced by permutation .",
    "the same strategy guided hylleraas and ore when they derived the first proof of stability of the positronium molecule , and lies also underneath the most recent calculations of this system .",
    "for example , in their study of the positronium molecule,@xcite varga and suzuki used a basis of correlated gaussians , and their own variant of the parameter search.@xcite this method is more and more widely used in quantum chemistry and other few - body problems .",
    "it consists , if @xmath163 are the internal variables , in describing the wave functions as superpositions of states such as @xmath164+\\cdots~,\\ ] ] where the ellipses are meant for terms deduced by permutation , charge conjugation or any other relevant symmetry which can be explicitly enforced .",
    "the two - electron atoms seems the best introduction to the advanced _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "in this appendix , we give some hints to estimate the matrix elements . these of the wave functions ( [ eq : eff - q ] ) and ( [ eq : chan ] ) have been given explicitly .",
