    "the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath9 , is one of the most precisely measured quantities in contemporary particle physics .",
    "the world average of the existing measurements is @xmath10 which is dominated by the recent value obtained by the e821 collaboration at bnl@xcite .",
    "it is so precisely measured that it is very useful in probing and constraining new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is therefore important to evaluate the sm prediction of @xmath11 as accurately as possible .",
    "the sm contribution to @xmath11 may be written as the sum of three terms , @xmath12 the qed contribution , @xmath13 , has been calculated up to and including estimates of the 5-loop contribution , see reviews  @xcite , @xmath14 in comparison with the experimental error in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bnl2001 ] ) , and with the hadronic contribution error discussed later , the uncertainty in @xmath13 is much less important than other sources of uncertainty .",
    "the electroweak contribution @xmath15 is calculated through second order to be  @xcite @xmath16 here again the error is negligibly small .",
    "less accurately known is the hadronic contribution @xmath17 .",
    "it can be divided into three pieces , @xmath18 the lowest - order ( vacuum polarisation ) hadronic contribution , @xmath19 , has been calculated by a number of groups . the value @xmath20 taken from ref .",
    "@xcite has been frequently used in making comparisons with the data .",
    "the next - to - leading order hadronic contribution , @xmath21 , is evaluated to be  @xcite @xmath22 the hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution @xmath23 has been recently reevaluated  @xcite@xcite , and it is found to be @xmath24 where we quote the estimate of the full hadronic light - by - light contributions given in ref .  @xcite . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hadlo_bydh98b ] ) , ( [ eq : hadnlo_bykrause ] ) and ( [ eq : hadlbyl ] ) , we can see that @xmath19 has the largest uncertainty , although the uncertainty in the light - by - light contribution @xmath23 is also large .    in this letter",
    "we update the evaluation of @xmath19 , which is given by the dispersion relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total cross section for @xmath27 at centre - of - mass energy @xmath28 .",
    "the kernel function @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 increases monotonically from 0.63 to 1 in the range @xmath34 .",
    "the form of @xmath35 for @xmath36 is given in  @xcite , and is used to evaluate the small @xmath37 contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "to evaluate @xmath26 , we use experimental data up to 11.09  gev and perturbative qcd thereafter .",
    "the most important contribution to @xmath26 comes from the @xmath38 channel ; the channels @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc .",
    "give subleading contributions .",
    "for example , if we evaluate @xmath44 using the sum of the data for the above 6 exclusive channels up to @xmath45gev , we obtain 87% of the total @xmath19 , with the @xmath46 contributing 72% .",
    "then if from 1.43 to 11.09  gev we were to use the measurements @xmath47 to determine @xmath26 , we would obtain another 11% of the total .",
    "as mentioned , our study to update @xmath19 is motivated by the increasing accuracy of the experimental value for @xmath48 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bnl2001 ] ) .",
    "the special features of our analysis are ( i )  that it is data - driven , based on all available data , including the new data on exclusive channels from novosibirsk , particularly @xmath46  @xcite , and the bes data on the @xmath49 ratio  @xcite , ( ii )   the careful application of a clustering method , so that data of differing precision can be combined consistently , and ( iii )  the use of qcd sum rules to resolve an apparent discrepancy between the inclusive and exclusive determination of @xmath26 for @xmath50  gev .",
    "we chose not to use data on hadronic @xmath51 decays to further constrain the @xmath52 channels for @xmath53 , because of the possible uncertainties connected with isospin - breaking effects .",
    "a careful study of the effects of including @xmath51 data has been made in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we apply the hadronic vacuum polarisation corrections given by swartz  @xcite . moreover , we calculated the final state radiative effects for all @xmath54 data , except for the new cmd2 data  @xcite , based on eq .",
    "( 45 ) of ref .",
    "these two corrections increase the @xmath46 contribution by about @xmath55 , to which we assign a 50% error . for the dominant cmd2 data the radiative corrections are already included by simply taking the cross section numbers for @xmath56 .",
    "since the recent accurate data  @xcite in the @xmath57 and @xmath58 resonance regions have not been corrected for any vacuum polarisation effects ( see the comment in  @xcite ) , we apply the full ( including the lepton vacuum polarisation ) corrections to these data . for the data on the other exclusive channels , and the inclusive data",
    "not discussed in  @xcite , insufficient information is available to make reliable radiative corrections .",
    "we therefore assign an additional @xmath59 uncertainty to their contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "the net effect is an error of about @xmath60 due to radiative corrections ; a further discussion will be given in  @xcite .",
    "we now come to the important problem of ` clustering ' data from different experiments ( for the same hadronic channel ) . to combine all data points for the same channel which fall in suitably chosen ( narrow ) energy bins",
    ", we determine the mean @xmath49 values and their errors for all clusters by minimising the non - linear @xmath61 function @xmath62 ^ 2 + \\sum_{m=1}^{n_{\\rm clust}}\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\{k , m\\ } } }   \\left[\\left(r_i^{\\{k , m\\ } } - f_k   r_m\\right)/ { \\rm d}r_i^{\\{k , m\\}}\\right]^2 .",

    "the statistical and point - to - point systematic errors are added in quadrature , whereas @xmath72 is the overall systematic error of the @xmath66 experiment .",
    "minimization of ( [ eq : chisquaredef ] ) with respect to the @xmath73 parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath63 , gives our best estimates for these parameters together with their error correlations .",
    "our definition ( [ eq : chisquaredef ] ) implies piecewise constant @xmath49 values but imposes no further constraints on the form of the hadronic cross section ( ` minimum bias ' ) . due to use of the overall normalization factors it also results in an adjustment of the different sets within their systematic uncertainties",
    "this means , for example , that sparse but precise data will dominate the normalization .",
    "still , the information on the shape of @xmath49 from sets with larger systematic uncertainties is preserved , and all data contribute weighted according to their significance .    the error estimate for each hadronic channel is then done using the complete covariance matrix returned by our @xmath61 minimization . therefore statistical and systematic ( point - to - point as well as overall ) errors from the different sets are taken into account including correlations between different energies ( clusters ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath61 directly reflects the quality of the fit and the consistency of the data .",
    "we have checked that for all hadronic channels we find a stable value and error for @xmath74 , together with a good , in which data sets are mutually incompatible , @xmath61/degree of freedom = 2.1 ,  1.6 .",
    "for both cases the error is enlarged by a factor of @xmath75 . ]",
    "if we vary the minimal cluster size around our chosen default values ( which are typically about 0.2  mev for a narrow resonance and about 30  mev for the continuum ) .    the dispersion integral ( [ eq : dispersion_rel ] ) is performed integrating ( using the trapezoidal rule ) over the clustered data directly for all hadronic channels , including the @xmath57 and @xmath58 resonances .",
    "thus we avoid possible problems due to missing or double - counting of non - resonant backgrounds , and interference effects are taken into account automatically . as an example we display in fig .",
