    "in @xcite s. negami proved that if a graph @xmath2 has a finite , unbranched , regular , planar cover then @xmath2 itself embeds in the projective plane @xmath3 ( for definitions see section  [ sec : prelims ] ) .",
    "we call a graph that embeds in @xmath3 _ projective_. note that all planar graphs are projective . in the same paper ,",
    "negami conjectured that this holds in general :    [ cnj : negami ] if a graph @xmath2 s has a finite unbranched planar cover then @xmath2 embeds in the projective plane @xmath3 .",
    "negami s result was extended by s. kitakubo to branched regular covers in @xcite ( with the exception of section  [ sec : necessity ] , any cover considered in this paper may be branched ) .",
    "we note that `` branched cover '' is not a standard term for graphs ; for a precise definition and discussion see definitions  [ dfn : branched - cover ] and remark  [ rmk : branched - cover ] .",
    "the definition used by kitakubo is what we call _ weak cover _ ; it is immediate from the definitions that every branched cover is a weak cover . for regular covers the converse holds as well : every regular weak cover is a branched cover .",
    "we do not have a clear idea about negami s conjecture for weak covers :    is negami s conjecture true for weak covers ?    given a finite cover @xmath0 and an embedding of @xmath1 into @xmath6 we define two properties called property @xmath4  and property @xmath5 .",
    "these properties depend on the covering map @xmath7 and the embedding of @xmath1 into @xmath6 .",
    "we prove negami s conjecture for covers @xmath0 fulfilling properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we show that regular covers fulfill properties @xmath4 and @xmath5  ( perhaps after re - embedding @xmath1 in @xmath6 ) .",
    "the converse does not hold : in example  [ ex : irregular ] we show an irregular cover fulfilling properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 , showing that the work here is more general than @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we now give a more detailed description of our results and the structure of this paper .",
    "in section  [ sec : prelims ] we give the necessary definition and background .    in section  [ sec : sufficiency ] we define properties @xmath4 and @xmath5  ( definitions [ dfn : pv ] and [ dfn : pe ] ) and show ( theorem  [ thm : sufficiency ] and corollary  [ cor : negami - cnj ] ) that if @xmath0 is a finite planar cover fulfilling properties @xmath4 and @xmath5   then @xmath2 is projective , thus proving negami s conjecture in that case .",
    "in fact , we show a little more : the map @xmath7 can be extended to a map @xmath8 , for some surface @xmath9 , and this map is a branched cover .",
    "it is then easy to see ( lemma  [ pro : f - covered - bysorp ] ) that either @xmath10 or @xmath11 .    in section  [ sec :",
    "regular ] we show that if @xmath12 is a _ regular _ finite , planar cover then it fulfills properties @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ".    in @xcite negami mentions the following strategy for proving conjecture  [ cnj : negami ] : given a finite cover @xmath0 it is a well - known application of group theory that there exists finite cover @xmath13 , so that the composition of the covers ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath14 ) is a finite regular cover ( we remark that the degree of @xmath15 is usually quite high )",
    ". however , negami continues , even if we assume that @xmath1 is planar , it does _ not _ follow that @xmath16 is planar as well . in section  [ sec : necessity ]",
    "we prove theorem  [ thm : necessity ] : let @xmath12 be a finite _ unbranched _ cover and let @xmath17 be a cover with @xmath18 . if the cover @xmath19 fulfills properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 , then either @xmath1 is planar and @xmath0 fulfills properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 , or @xmath1 embeds in @xmath3 ; in that case , lifting @xmath1 to the universal cover of @xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ , to the double cover @xmath20 ) we obtain a finite planar cover of @xmath2 fulfilling properties @xmath4 and @xmath5(this is sharp ",
    "see example  [ ex : have - to - lift ] ) .",
    "thus , if we wish to pass to a cover of @xmath1 in oder to prove that @xmath2 is planar , we need not look for further than double covers .    in section  [ sec :",
    "examples ] we give examples .",
    "the first is example  [ ex : irregular ] , which is an irregular cover fulfilling properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "next ( example  [ ex : k4 ] ) we give an example of two distinct double covers of the planar graph @xmath21 , both fulfilling properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we use both covers to embed @xmath21 .",
    "the first gives an embedding into @xmath6 and the second into @xmath3 , demonstrating that the embedding depends on the cover in a non - trivial way .",
    "next , we exemplify theorem  [ thm : necessity ] by showing ( example  [ ex : have - to - lift ] ) a planar cover @xmath22 that does not fulfill properties @xmath4 and @xmath5  for any planar embedding of @xmath23",
    ". however , @xmath23 embeds in @xmath3 and the lift of that embedding to @xmath6 does fulfill properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 . finally , we show a more disturbing phenomenon : in conjecture  [ ex : no properties ] we show a planar finite cover @xmath22 and we _ conjecture _ that is has no finite cover @xmath24 so the composition @xmath25 fulfills properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "what happens here is that the cover @xmath23 is simply the _",
    "wrong cover _ _ , and this can not be fixed by passing to a higher cover .",
    "this , perhaps , explains the difficulty in proving negami s conjecture .",
    "_ _ _    so is negami s conjecture true ? at the current time , the answer is not known . however , the work of many people ( including d. archdeacon , m. fellows , p. hlinn , negami , r. thomas ) accumulated in proving that negami s conjecture is equivalent to the statement : _ the graph @xmath26 has no finite planar cover .",
    "_ this seems to us very strong evidence supporting conjecture  [ cnj : negami ] .",
    "assuming conjecture  [ cnj : negami ] for a moment , in light of the results and examples in this paper we ask : suppose we are given a finite planar cover @xmath0 not fulfilling properties @xmath4 and @xmath5  for any embedding of @xmath1 ( or a cover of @xmath1 ) into @xmath6 ( _ i.e. _ , a `` wrong cover '' ) , how can we correct that cover ?",
    "we end section  [ sec : examples ] with two ways to `` fix '' the cover in conjecture  [ ex : no properties ] .",
    "the first is a cut - and - paste procedure that produces a cover fulfilling properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; this changes the graph @xmath1 .",
    "the second does not change @xmath1 but embeds it into some non - orientable surface ( not unlike theorem  [ thm : necessity ] ) .",
    "this gives an embedding of @xmath2 into _ some _ surface , not necessarily @xmath3 , with control over the euler characteristic of that surface .",
    "for a graph @xmath2 , we denote the vertices of @xmath2 by @xmath27 and the edges of @xmath2 by @xmath28 .",
    "naturally , any map between graphs is assumed to map vertices to vertices and edges to edges .",
    "we follow standard definitions and terminology used in topology : @xmath29 means _ closed _ regular ( or normal ) neighborhood , @xmath30 is read boundary , @xmath31 is read closure , and @xmath32 is read interior . a homeomorphism is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse .",
    "@xmath33 stands for euler characteristic .",
    "all surface are assumed to be connected .    as it is easy to reduce negami s conjecture to graphs @xmath2 with no cycles of length one or two ( that is",

    "then the composition @xmath315 does not fulfill properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we end this paper by describing two ways of dealing with the cover @xmath23 given in figure  [ fig : no - properties ] .",
    "first , note that if the four disks enclosed in dashed circles in figure  [ fig : no - properties ] are replaced by the disks given in figure  [ fig : fixme ] ( and some of the `` mushrooms '' are reflected ) , we obtain the cover shown in figure  [ fig : fixed ] that does fulfill properties @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the work in this paper suggests that topological `` cut - and - paste '' techniques such as this could be very useful .",
    "next , recall figures  [ fig : have - to - lift1 ] and [ fig : have - to - lift2 ] where we replaced a disk with a mbius band . similarly , we can replace the four disks in figure  [ fig : no - properties ] with four mbius bands , obtaining an embedding of @xmath23 into a non - orientable surface @xmath316 ; since replacing a disk with a mbius band lowers the euler characteristic by 1 , @xmath317 .",
    "just like @xmath318 , @xmath316 has an oriented double cover ( say @xmath319 ) .",
    "the euler characteristic is multiplicative under unbranched covers , and we conclude that @xmath319 is the surface of genus 3 .",
    "( in general , if we replace @xmath320 disks with mbius bands the oriented double cover will have genus @xmath321 . )",
    "the reader can verify that the proof of theorem  [ thm : sufficiency ] is valid , and gives a surface @xmath9 , an embedding @xmath322 , and a cover @xmath323 that extends @xmath7 .",
    "as in lemma  [ pro : f - covered - bysorp ] , @xmath324 .",
    "( in general , @xmath325 . )",
    "this does not give an embedding of @xmath2 into @xmath3 , but does give an embedding of @xmath2 into a surface with some control over its euler characteristic ."
