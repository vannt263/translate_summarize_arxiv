    "a number of possible practical applications of entangled states has been proposed , including the quantum computation  @xcite and the quantum teleportation  @xcite .",
    "thus it is very important to know , how the interaction with an environment influences the dynamical behavior of entanglement . in many experiments as a source of entangled pairs serves the process of the parametric down conversion in the non - linear crystals  @xcite , in which two - mode squeezed vacuum states are produced .",
    "hence , here we consider the time evolution of the two - mode squeezed vacuum , as an example of continuous variable entangled state , embedded in a thermal environment .",
    "moreover , let us assume that , for some reason , e.g. storage , both modes are captured in a resonant cavity , i.e. they are coupled to a common reservoir . additionally we presume that they have the same frequency .",

    "@xcite , hiroshima  @xcite and paris  @xcite assumed that the two - mode squeezed vacuum interacts with the environment in a different way . in their model both modes are spatially separated and thus each of them is independently coupled to its own reservoir .",
    "both modes are taken to have the same frequency and the same coupling constant .",
    "this model is justified , while the two - mode squeezed vacuum can be used as a quantum channel between sender and receiver stations in the quantum teleportation  @xcite .",
    "there is a possible experimental investigation of degradation of entanglement due to the interaction with the environment  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a bipartite system , namely , two modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "each of those modes has the hilbert space equivalent to the hilbert space of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the hilbert space of the system of the interest is a tensor product of subsystem s hilbert spaces , @xmath0 .",

    "bipartite system in question is embedded in the thermal environment , which we imitate by the set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "we model the coupling of both modes to the common reservoir by the interaction hamiltonian of the form : @xmath6 while in the case when each mode interacts with its own reservoir , the interaction hamiltonian is : @xmath7 in both cases @xmath8 is a coupling constant .    in order to study the evolution of our system we use the wigner distribution function defined as  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is density operator , @xmath11 and .    for the sake of convenience",

    "let us note , that there is possible an equivalent approach to the separability properties of quantum two - party gaussian states in the framework of the operator formalism for the density operator , as it has been shown by englert and wdkiewicz  @xcite .    to compute the degree of entanglement we use the _ logarithmic negativity _",

    "this measure can be regarded as a quantitative version of the peres - horodecki criterion  @xcite , because it quantifies the degree to which @xmath29 fails to be positive  @xcite .    for states described by the wigner function of the form  ( [ wigner ] ) , computing of the logarithmic negativity  ( [ miara ] )",
    "simplifies to process known as sympletic diagonalization of the variance matrix  ( [ variance ] ) , as has been shown in  @xcite , i.e. if @xmath31 is the sympletic spectrum of the variance matrix  ( [ variance ] ) , then the logarithmic negativity equals : @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is : @xmath35    evolution of two modes of the electromagnetic field coupled to the common thermal reservoir might be described by the diffusion equation , i.e. the fokker - planck equation .",
