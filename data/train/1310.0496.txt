    "such an approach ( in the case of a nontransverse homoclinic point ) has been suggested by s. tikhomirov .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the case of a diffeomorphism @xmath0 of a very simple form ( [ 4.0 ] ) to simplify presentation ( as the reader will see , even this case is not completely trivial ) ; of course , our reasoning can be applied in more general situations .",
