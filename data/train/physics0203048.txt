    "the topological structure of magnetic fields is an important subject in plasma physics .",
    "there , among other issues , it is related to the problem of stability of a plasma and to its energy content . fields with an enormous wealth of entangled , braided or knotted field lines exist for example in the solar atmosphere .",
    "note that the topological complexity of these solar magnetic fields is only revealed , if first , one takes into account that the observed loops anchored in the photosphere are closed by subphotospheric fields , and second , that already simple toroidal equilibria contain many different knotted and linked field lines .",
    "the simplest examples are the so called torus knots , which are formed by field lines where the quotient of the number of windings around the core and the torus axis is rational .    in general , magnetic fields in plasmas",
    "are not static , but evolve due to the motion of the plasma .",
    "the evolution of solar as well as most astrophysical magnetic fields is given in good approximation by the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( imhd ) @xmath1 which shows that the field can be considered as frozen - in with respect to the plasma velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the approximation of imhd which leads to this law is valid as long as the evolution does not lead to small scale structures , e.g.  thin current sheets .",
    "the ideal induction equation guarantees the conservation of the topology of field lines under the flow of @xmath2 , i.e. every linkage or knottedness of magnetic flux is preserved .",
    "mathematically speaking , the flow of @xmath2 is a differentiable isotopy of the space under consideration .",
    "it maps the field lines of @xmath3 at time @xmath4 to a topologically equivalent set of field lines for any later time @xmath5 .",
    "let us note that , following the usual terminology in plasma physics , the term ` topological equivalent ' is used here in the sense of a diffeomorphic isotopy .",
    "[ whitehead ]    in order to describe the structure of magnetic fields , it is desirable to have measures of complexity . these measures should be topological , i.e. they should be invariant under an arbitrary isotopy of the magnetic field , and therefore invariant under the ideal induction equation .",
    "an example of a topological measure for magnetic fields is the magnetic helicity , a quantity which has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years ( see e.g.  brown 1999 ) .",
    "magnetic helicity , which measures the linkage of magnetic flux , is only a lowest order topological measure .",
    "it fails for instance to detect the interlocking of magnetic flux tubes in form of the borromean rings or the whitehead link ( see figure [ borro ] ) .",
    "the total magnetic helicity of these configurations vanishes just as it does for three or two unlinked flux tubes .",
    "both configurations must possess a higher order linkage or knottedness of magnetic flux which is not detected by magnetic helicity .",
    "this naturally raises the question whether corresponding higher order measures similar to magnetic helicity exist which are sensitive to these linkages .",
    "here we would like to remark that the configurations shown in figure [ borro ] are highly idealized . in any real plasma",
    "we would not find this pure linkage but a mixture of different types of linkages , each of which is to be measured by a different integral .    in knot theory",
    "different invariants are known which distinguish e.g. the borromean rings or the whitehead link from unlinked rings .",
    "the problem is that invariants used in physical applications , e.g. in magnetohydrodynamics , should be expressed in terms of observable quantities , in our setting in terms of the magnetic field @xmath6 . up to now",
    "only the helicity , which is related to the gau   linking number , has been formulated as an invariant for magnetic fields in a satisfactory manner . as was recognized first by monastyrsky and sasorov ( 1987 ) and independently by berger ( 1990 ) and evans and berger ( 1992 ) , the link invariants based on so - called higher massey products",
    "( see massey 1958 , 1969 , kraines 1966 , fenn 1983 ) can be written as invariants applicable to magnetic flux tubes .",
    "similar to helicity , they only involve the magnetic fields and can be expressed as volume integrals over the space in consideration .",
    "their disadvantage is that their usage is restricted to magnetic fields confined to isolated flux tubes .",
    "in addition , these flux tubes must not possess a linkage lower than the linkage which is measured .",
    "in this paper we present a generalized third - order invariant for three magnetic fields not confined to isolated flux tubes . in the case of isolated flux tubes",
    "this invariant coincides with the invariant known from the massey triple product .",
    "using gauge fields in the context of an @xmath0 symmetry , the generalized invariant can be shown to originate from the same equation as helicity .",
    "therefore , we will first recapitulate some basic facts about magnetic helicity before we turn to our main subject , the third - order link invariant .",
    "magnetic helicity of a field @xmath6 with arbitrary vector potential @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 which can readily be shown to be gauge invariant if no magnetic flux crosses the boundary of the volume .",
    "since it is quadratic in magnetic flux it is often referred to as a second - order topological invariant .",
    "magnetic helicity measures the total mutual linkage of magnetic flux .",
    "this interpretation can be motivated if we envisage a simple system of two isolated and closed flux tubes @xmath9 and @xmath10 with vanishingly small cross - section .",
    "the latter condition ensures that the ( self-)helicities of the flux tubes vanish .",
    "moffatt ( 1969 ) has shown that for this configuration the helicity integral yields @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gau   linking number ( gau  1867 ) of the two tubes and where @xmath13 is the magnetic flux in the tube @xmath14 . introducing an asymptotic linking number , arnold ( 1974 ) was able to extend this interpretation to the generic case where field lines are not necessarily closed ( see also arnold & khesin 1998 , part iii ,  4 ) .",
    "similar to _ helicity _ we can introduce the more general _ cross - helicity _ of two magnetic fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "for a simply connected volume @xmath17 and provided that @xmath18 we define @xmath19 the boundary conditions ensure that this is again a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "to see that the two integrals on the right - hand side are equivalent , note that they differ only by a surface integral @xmath20 .",
    "this can be shown to vanish using the equivalence of @xmath21 with @xmath22 in a certain gauge and for a simply connected volume @xmath17 , as proved in [ equivboundaryconditions ] .",
    "since both integrals are gauge invariant this proves the equality for any gauge .",
    "@xmath23 measures purely the cross linkage of flux among the two fields .",
    "applied to our system of two isolated closed flux tubes with fields @xmath24 in the corresponding tubes this invariant yields @xmath25 which is now valid without the assumption of vanishingly small tube cross - sections .",
    "the significance of magnetic helicity arises from the fact that it is invariant in imhd .",
    "using merely the homogeneous maxwell equations we obtain @xmath26 which describes the time evolution of helicity density @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the electric potential and @xmath29 the electric field .",
    "the term @xmath30 is to be interpreted as a _",
    "helicity current _ , and @xmath31 as a _ source term_. in an ideal plasma , i.e. with @xmath32 , the source term vanishes and the helicity current can be written as @xmath33 therefore ( [ helicity - density ] ) takes the form : @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "elsasser ( 1956 ) already noticed that a particular gauge can be found such that @xmath36 . using either this gauge or an arbitrary gauge together with the boundary condition @xmath37",
    "this last equation implies the conservation of helicity in a comoving volume for an ideal plasma , since @xmath38 the invariance of integral ( [ heldef ] ) was first stated by woltjer ( 1958 ) .",
    "in this section we construct a third - order invariant which , under conditions specified below , yields an invariant for three magnetic fields .",
    "the derivation is based on some basic knowledge in differential geometry found e.g.  in frankel ( 1997 ) .",
    "we have noted before that ( [ helicity - density ] ) can be derived purely from the homogeneous maxwell equations . written in differential forms it reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the one - form potential of the field @xmath41 .",
    "the right - hand side of this equation is one of two ( pseudo- ) scalar lorentz invariants that can be constructed from the field tensor .",
    "we can interpret this equation as a special case of a general result in the theory of chern forms , namely the exactness of the second chern form @xmath42 in this equation @xmath40 and @xmath41 are a matrix valued one- and two - form . to be more precise",
    "they take their values in the lie - algebra @xmath43 of the structure group . in yang - mills",
    "theory this is the symmetry group of the interaction under consideration , with coupling constant @xmath44 . on the vector space @xmath43",
    "the trace defines a natural scalar product . for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , where the indices denote matrix components .",
    "equation ( [ chern - simons ] ) holds for an arbitrary , not necessarily abelian , field strength @xmath48 .",
    "the three - form on the left - hand side is known as the chern - simons three - form . for the case of electrodynamics ,",
    "i.e. for the abelian structure group @xmath49 , @xmath41 is given by @xmath50 , since @xmath51 vanishes and ( [ chern - simons ] ) reduces to ( [ fwedgef ] ) .",
    "in the non - abelian case ( [ chern - simons ] ) splits into a real and imaginary part @xmath52 as we will see in the following a third - order invariant can be derived from identity ( [ identity - cs - imaginary ] ) for the special case of the structure group @xmath0 .",
    "working with an @xmath0 structure group it is appropriate to choose the pauli matrices @xmath53 , @xmath54=@xmath55 , as a basis for the lie algebra @xmath56 .",
    "all results , however , are independent of this choice .",
    "the gauge potential @xmath40 and field strength @xmath41 now have three components @xmath57 where the summation convention over repeated indices is assumed .",
    "let us note that in the following we will refer to these fields as yang - mills fields , although they do not necessarily satisfy the yang - mills equation . using the identities for pauli matrices @xmath58 equations ( [ identity - cs - real ] ) and ( [ identity - cs - imaginary ] ) read @xmath59 if we now interpret the three components of the yang - mills potential @xmath40 as three independent potentials of three electromagnetic fields @xmath60 , the first identity states the helicity conservation ( in imhd ) for the sum of the self - helicities of the three individual fields @xmath61 , similar to the electrodynamic case .",
    "the second identity is new . for convenience",
    "we introduce the two - form @xmath62 , here on @xmath63 , and cyclic permutations of it .",
    "then we can write the second identity as @xmath64 to complete the analogy of this equation with ( [ helicity - density ] ) we have to rewrite it in the language of three - vectors . therefore we represent the one - form @xmath65 by the time component @xmath66 and the three - vector @xmath67 of the corresponding four - vector .",
    "the two - form @xmath68 is identified with the vector pair @xmath69 , equivalent to the identification of @xmath70 with the three - vector pair ( @xmath29,-@xmath6 ) .",
    "cyclic permutations immediately lead to corresponding pairs for @xmath71 and @xmath72 . using these conventions , the left- and right - hand side of ( [ second - identity ] ) read respectively @xmath73 and @xmath74 thus , identity ( [ second - identity ] ) is equivalent to @xmath75 which shows a similar structure as ( [ helicity - density ] ) in the case of helicity .",
    "it describes the time evolution of the density @xmath76 with its current @xmath77 and source term @xmath78 .",
    "this is the basis for the following theorem . +",
    "* theorem : * _ let @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 be three magnetic fields with potentials @xmath67 satisfying @xmath82 .",
    "the integral over a volume @xmath83 _",
    "@xmath84    _ is a gauge invariant , conserved quantity , if _    1 .",
    "the potentials obey @xmath85 for all @xmath86 , [ h-3-condition-1 ] 2 .",
    "the potentials obey the boundary condition @xmath87 for @xmath88 being the normal vector to the boundary of the integration volume @xmath17 .",
    "[ h-3-condition-2 ]    _ proof _ : let us first remark that condition ( [ h-3-condition-2 ] ) of the theorem implies @xmath89 as shown in [ equivboundaryconditions ] .",
    "it is therefore consistent with condition ( [ h-3-condition-1 ] ) since @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , we show in [ equivboundaryconditions ] that for a simply connected volume with @xmath89 condition ( [ h-3-condition-2 ] ) can always be satisfied . in order to prove the invariance of @xmath91 we observe that in an ideal dynamics ( [ third - order - density - evolution ] ) can be written as @xmath92 where the last term vanishes due to condition ( [ h-3-condition-1 ] ) .    integrating over the volume @xmath17 yields the total time derivative of @xmath91 on the left - hand side , while the right - hand side can be converted into a surface integral , analogous to ( [ helicity - conservation - proof ] ) in the case of helicity . the surface integral vanishes since condition ( [ h-3-condition-2 ] ) of the theorem implies @xmath93 on the boundary of the volume @xmath17 .",
    "this , together with the gauge invariance of @xmath91 shown in [ appendix - h-3-gauge - invariance ] , completes the proof .",
    "it is interesting to note that the new third - order invariant comes on an equal footing as the conservation of helicity , since both invariants where derived from the same identity ( [ chern - simons ] ) .",
    "however , contrary to the conservation of helicity , the third - order integral can not be applied to a single magnetic field , but requires a triplet of fields .",
    "thus we have to interpret this integral in the sense of the cross - helicity rather than the total helicity .",
    "a forthcoming paper will deal with the question of how a single magnetic field might be split into a triplet of fields with the required properties @xmath94 , thereby linking the given _ cross _",
    "third - order invariant and a _ total _ third - order invariant",
    ".    there is another way of looking at the new third - order invariant . by writing @xmath95",
    "the integral is to be interpreted as the cross - helicity of the two divergence - free fields @xmath79 and @xmath96 .",
    "note that the boundary conditions for the cross - helicity , namely @xmath97 and @xmath98 , are fulfilled due to condition ( [ h-3-condition-2 ] ) of the theorem . from this new interpretation",
    "the condition @xmath99 is an obvious requirement analogous to @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry of @xmath91 leads to @xmath101 which reveals the additional conditions @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "let us note that this interpretation does not simplify the direct calculation of the third - order invariant .",
    "it is still necessary to determine the fields @xmath104 which are not independent of the chosen representatives @xmath67 .",
    "third - order linking integrals for magnetic fields have been constructed from the massey triple product already by monastyrsky and sasorov ( 1987 ) , berger ( 1990 ) and also ruzmaikin and akhmetiev ( 1994 ) .",
    "however , these constructions are limited to cases where the three fields are confined to three isolated and mutually unlinked flux tubes with disjunct support .",
    "it is in fact easy to see that for this special case their invariants coincide with the integral ( [ h-3-continuous - integral ] ) given above .",
    "an explicit proof is given in [ equivalentintegrals ] .",
    "in particular , it is worth noting that for fields with mutually disjunct support the condition @xmath105 implies that the cross - helicity of all pairs of fields vanishes , i.e.  their flux tubes have to be mutually unlinked .    for a set of three arbitrary magnetic fields @xmath105 can not always be satisfied . to show that there are examples for which this can be satisfied , beyond the cases of three fields with mutually disjunct support , we give an explicit example in the next section .",
    "in this section we want to give an example of three magnetic fields not confined to flux tubes , which firstly allow for one - form potentials that obey @xmath106 and where secondly the integral invariant ( [ h-3-continuous - integral ] ) yields a non - trivial result .",
    "the existence of such an example proves that the new invariant is indeed a generalization of the third - order invariant derived from a massey triple product which was applicable merely to unlinked flux tubes .",
    "the fields we construct show an extraordinary high symmetry . for this reason they are interesting in their own right .",
    "the idea to construct three fields @xmath65 on @xmath107 which obey @xmath106 comes from yang - mills theory : an @xmath0 yang - mills field @xmath108 can , in view of ( [ su - two - aandf ] ) and the identities for pauli matrices ( [ pauli - matrices - identities ] ) , be written as @xmath109 by taking the exterior derivative of @xmath41 , @xmath110 we immediately observe that @xmath111 is a sufficient condition for all @xmath112 to vanish . in the special case of a vacuum yang - mills field ,",
    "i.e. @xmath113 , the requirement @xmath111 is trivially fulfilled .",
    "if we now reinterpret the three components of the yang - mills potential as potentials of three independent magnetic fields , we have constructed an example field configuration to which the invariant ( [ h-3-continuous - integral ] ) can be applied .",
    "an @xmath0 yang - mills vacuum field is now constructed on a time slice @xmath114 of @xmath107 using the mapping @xmath115 ( see e.g.  frankel 1997 , itzykson and zuber 1980 ) @xmath116 .",

    "an important consequence of this non - trivial winding number will be a non - trivial value of the invariant @xmath91 , as can be seen in equations ( [ h-3-in - example ] ) and ( [ h-3-and - w ] ) below .    in order to explicitly calculate the one - form potential @xmath40 given by the last expression we use that @xmath118 , as an element of @xmath0 ,",
    "has the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 and where @xmath126 is a unit vector in @xmath114 with coordinate components @xmath127 .",
    "a comparison with ( [ g - original ] ) shows @xmath128 substituting ( [ g - in - exp - form ] ) into ( [ pure - gauge - omega - a ] ) we obtain after some calculation @xmath129 .",
    "\\label{yang - mills - potential - components}\\ ] ]      as mentioned above we now interpret the three components of the non - abelian pure gauge yang - mills potential @xmath40 as potentials of three independent , non - vanishing magnetic fields .",
    "it is sufficient to consider only one of the three potentials @xmath65 , since due to @xmath130 and the cyclic symmetry of ( [ yang - mills - potential - components ] ) in the indices @xmath131 all three fields can be obtained from just one field by rotations that map the @xmath132-axes on one another . from ( [ yang - mills - potential - components ] )",
    "we calculate the vector potential @xmath133 in spherical coordinates @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 . using unit basis vectors @xmath137 and fixing a value for the `` coupling constant '' of @xmath138 , we find @xmath139 the corresponding magnetic field can be calculated from @xmath140 .",
    "it is easy to check that the fields @xmath141 are well defined and scale as @xmath142 for @xmath143 and as @xmath144 for @xmath145 .",
    "hence , they have no singularity and decay sufficiently fast for large radii .",
    "let us note that the fields @xmath141 are highly symmetric and similar . looking at the vector potential @xmath133 we observe that it is independent of the variable @xmath146 , therefore @xmath81 is invariant under rotations leaving the @xmath147-axis fixed .",
    "since the potentials ( [ yang - mills - potential - components ] ) are cyclic in @xmath131 it follows that each @xmath141 field is invariant under rotations about the @xmath132 axis .",
    "we have pointed out before that a rotation that maps the euclidian basis vector field @xmath148 to @xmath149 also maps @xmath79 to @xmath80 etc .",
    "furthermore , @xmath81 is similar to the total field @xmath150 in the following sense : let @xmath151 be a rotation that maps the euclidian basis vector @xmath152 to the vector @xmath153 , then @xmath154 .",
    "the magnetic fields @xmath141 are only of interest for us if their third - order invariant does not vanish . explicitly calculating @xmath67 for @xmath155",
    "we find , using the main theorem , @xmath156 the fact that this integral is non - vanishing proves , that the constructed invariant can not only be applied to all cases for which we where able to calculate the already existing invariant , i.e.  to three mutually unlinked flux tubes , but also to examples of triples of fields not having disjunct support .",
    "it is thus a true generalization of the existing invariant known from the massey triple product .",
    "as we have pointed out before , @xmath91 is related to the vacuum winding number @xmath157 of the connection @xmath158 .",
    "we easily find ( see also frankel 1997 ) @xmath159 where the trace term is usually referred to as the cartan three - form on @xmath0 .    in the general case the cross - helicities of three magnetic fields , for which we are able to find potentials such that @xmath160 , do not have to vanish . in our example",
    "we can easily verify that they do vanish , i.e. @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "of more interest are the three non - trivial self - helicities .",
    "if a triple of magnetic fields is derived from a yang - mills vacuum , ( [ df - su2 ] ) together with @xmath113 implies @xmath163 using the definitions @xmath164 and @xmath165 we find for @xmath166",
    "cyclic @xmath167 thus , for @xmath155 , we observe that @xmath168 therefore the self - helicities are equal to the value of the third - order invariant .",
    "this is a peculiarity of all magnetic field triples derived from an @xmath0 yang - mills vacuum .                    in our analysis of the three example magnetic fields",
    "we now turn our attention to the topological structure of the fields and the linkage of individual field lines .",
    "figure [ figure - b-1 - 2 - 3-field - lines ] and [ figure - zero - cross - helicity ] show numerically integrated field lines , where the starting points for integration are indicated by the foot points of the arrows that give the field line direction .",
    "we observe that all field lines are closed and have an elliptical shape .",
    "figures [ figure - b3-field - dens - cont ] and [ figure - b3-field - lines - on - torus ] visualize the toroidal structure of the individual fields at the example of @xmath81 . using @xmath169 and",
    "@xmath170 it follows that @xmath81 can be written @xmath171 therefore , the field lines of @xmath81 lie on @xmath146-invariant toroidal surfaces described by @xmath172 .",
    "figure [ figure - b3-field - dens - cont ] shows the poloidal @xmath81-field and contour lines for three different values of @xmath173 . a toroidal surface with @xmath174 and four field lines on it",

    "the central field line , sitting within all tori is characterized by @xmath175 . in view of the last equation , this is equivalent to @xmath176 which yields @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "we observe that all field lines wind around the central field line exactly once . from this and the toroidal structure of @xmath81",
    "we can conclude that any two arbitrary field lines @xmath179 and @xmath180 of @xmath81 have a gau   linkage @xmath181 .",
    "finally let us discuss the linking properties among field lines of different fields . to give an example , one field line of each field",

    "the symmetric appearance is due to the choice of symmetric starting points for the field line integration .",

    "it is interesting that the total linkage of the set of field lines is @xmath188 .",
    "even though we have seen that the mutual cross - helicities of all three fields vanish , their individual field lines , in general , are linked pairwise . to be more precise :",
    "if we e.g.  fix one field line @xmath184 of @xmath81 , then all field lines of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are either linked with @xmath184 exactly once or they intersect @xmath184 twice . for reasons of symmetry",
    ", there exists for each field line @xmath182 of @xmath79 a field line @xmath189 of @xmath79 , such that we find the total linkage @xmath190 .",

    "finally let us remark that in the same way as we obtained @xmath189 we can obtain field lines @xmath194 and @xmath195 , here with integration starting points @xmath193 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "together , these three field lines yield a configuration complementary to the one shown in figure [ figure - b-1 - 2 - 3-field - lines ] , which now has a total linkage of @xmath198 .",
    "an integral expression has been presented which generalizes the third - order invariant known from the massey triple product , to an invariant not limited to mutually unlinked flux tubes , if the involved fields allow for potentials that obey @xmath199 for  @xmath162 .",

    "emerge from the same general identity , which involves the chern - simons three - form in the context of an @xmath0 gauge symmetry . whether this identity leads to further results for other gauge groups has not yet been investigated , but it is clear that only expressions quadratic and cubic in magnetic flux can be obtained .",
    "the constructed invariant is to be seen as a `` cross - linkage '' of three fields .",
    "it still remains to clarify whether or how a total third - order invariant can be constructed and whether this is possible with the help of a cross third - order linkage such as in the case of helicity .",
    "there might e.g.  exist a subdivision of a single field into three components such that the total third - order linkage is determined by the cross - linkage alone .",
