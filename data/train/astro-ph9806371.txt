    "in this paper we describe the observations and analysis that have been performed in a search for photometrically detectable signals from the presence of extrasolar planets around the eclipsing binary cm draconis .",
    "this is the first long - term observational application of the transit method for the detection of extrasolar planets .",
    "the transit method is based on observing small drops in the brightness of a stellar system , resulting from the transit of a planet across the disk of its central star .",
    "such transits would cause characteristic changes in the central star s brightness and , to a lesser extend , color .",
    "the depth of a transit is proportional to the surface area of the planet , and the duration of a transit is indicative of the planet s velocity . if the central star s mass is known , the distance and period of the planet can then be derived .",
    "once repeated transits of the same planet are observed , the period can be obtained with great precision .",
    "the transit method was first proposed by struve ( 1952 ) ; later developments are described in @xcite .",
    "previous observational tests have been prevented by the required photometric precision ( which is about 1 part in 10@xmath2 in the case of an earth - sized planet transiting a sun - like star ) , and by the generally low probability that a planetary plane is aligned correctly to produce transits .",
    "this probability of orbital alignment is about 1% for planetary systems similar to our solar system .",
    "an observationally appealing application is available with close binary systems , where the probability is high that the planetary orbital plane is coplanar with the binary orbital plane , and thus in the line sight .",
    "this makes the observational detection of planetary transits feasible in systems with an inclination very close to 90@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , repeated planetary transits across the binary s components will result in unique sequences of transit - lightcurves , whose exact shape depends on the phase of the binary system at the time of the planetary transit ( fig .  [ fig : transshapes ] ) .",
    "jenkins et al .",
    "( 1996 ) demonstrated , that these unique sequences can be used for the detection of planetary signatures with amplitudes below the noise of the observed lightcurves , if signal detection techniques based on cross correlations with model lightcurves are applied .",
    "the near ideal characteristics of the eclipsing binary system cm dra for an observational test on the presence of planets has been suggested by schneider and doyle ( 1995 ) .",
    "the cm dra system is the eclipsing binary system with the lowest mass known , with components of spectral class dm4.5/dm4.5 ( see @xcite , for all system elements ) .",
    "the total surface area of the systems components is about 12% of the sun s , and the transits of a planet with 3.2 r@xmath4 , corresponding to 2.5% of the volume of jupiter , would cause a brightness drop of about 0.01 mag , which is within easy reach of current differential photometric techniques .",
    "the low temperature of cm dra also implies that planets in the thermal regime of solar system terrestrial planets would circle the central binary with orbital periods on the order of weeks .",
    "this allows for a high detection probability of planetary transits by observational campaigns with coverages lasting more than one planetary period .",
    "planets with orbital periods of 10 - 30 days around cm dra are especially interesting , since they would would lie within the habitable zone , which is the region around a star where planetary surface temperatures can support liquid water , and therefore the development of organic life ( see kasting et al . 1993 ; doyle 1996 ) .",
    "cm dra is relatively close ( 17.6 pc ) and has a near edge - on inclination of 89.82 . with this inclination , coplanar planets within a distance of cm dra of @xmath5 0.35 au will cause a transit event",
    "this maximum distance corresponds to a circular orbit with a period of about 125 days .",
    "there is also a low probability of observing orbits from planets inclined out of cm dra s binary orbital plane , if the ascending or descending nodes of the planetary orbits are precessing across the line of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations of cm dra presented in this paper are therefore the first attempt to obtain observational evidence of the existence of sub - jupiter sized planets around main - sequence binary stars , and to evaluate the probability that such detections are possible . for these observations we used differential ccd - photometry and employed 1 m class telescopes .",
    "to obtain sufficient observational coverage , the tep ( transits of extrasolar planets ) network was formed with the participation of several observatories in 1994 .",
    "preliminary accounts of tep network observations are given by doyle et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , martin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and deeg et al .",
    "a list of the observatories that have been participating is given in table  [ tab : scopes ] .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a)b )    assuming that we may have already observed transits of a potential planet 3 or more times , we searched for periodicities among the transit candidates , using those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipevents ] , and a few less pronounced candidates . among these",
    "_ transit _ candidates , several thousand possibilities for _ planetary _ candidates ( with 3 or more already observed transits ! ) were found .",
    "planetary _ candidate represents a combination of a possible planetary orbital period and epoch , the later one being defined as the time , when the planetary candidate is crossing in front of the barycenter of cm dra , as stated . modeled lightcurves of these planetary candidates ( assuming radii of 1.5 , 2 and 2.5 r@xmath6 , and using the model - code that generated the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transshapes ] ) were cross - correlated against the observed lightcurve .",
    "this led to a list of several 100 planetary candidates which reasonably fitted the observed lightcurve .",
    "for the best 10 of these planetary candidates , transit times were predicted , and pointed observations at these predicted times were undertaken in the spring of 1997 at the iac80 telescope .",
    "unfortunately , no transits were observed at any of these predicted times . except for",
    "these 10 tested planetary candidates , however , these results can not rule out any other planets in this size range yet . since it is impossible to observe at",
    "predicted transit times for the whole list of several 100 planetary candidates , we are currently again engaging in observations that will increase transit coverage in general , in order to reveal further smaller transit candidates .",
    "we want to emphasize , that the observed transit candidates of fig .",
    "[ fig : dipevents ] are examples of events that can be caused by planetary transits , but only _ repeated _ observation of transits from the _ same _ planetary candidate can verify their true nature .    whereas there are multitudes of planetary candidates that may have caused the light drops reported in table  [ tab : diplist ]",
    ", we note that there are no observed light - drops with amplitudes larger than 0.01 mag .",
    "cross - correlations between model - lightcurves of planetary transits and the observed light - drops showed that in no case can planets much larger than 2.5 r@xmath6 be responsible for these observed light - drops .",
    "our observational coverage gives a confidence of about 80% that such larger planets with periods of less than 60 days can be excluded .",
    "for periods of less than 20 days , this confidence is 98% . if the light - drops of table  [ tab : diplist ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : dipevents ] are indeed from planetary transits , they must result from planets with sizes between 1.5 and 2.5 r@xmath6 .",
    "a signal detection approach was taken for preliminarily assessing confidence in the detectability of planets in this size range within the current data set .",
    "for this , 36000 model transits were generated for 2 r@xmath6 planets with periods of 10 days through 30 days ( the habitable zone around cm dra ) , and included in the data .",
    "subsequent detection attempts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detcstat ] ) showed that 50% of the time , the detection statistic for a 2 r@xmath4 planet transiting cm dra would be above the detection statistics generated from our photometric data ( the number of times the cross - correlation values for the transit curve were higher than the noisy observational data ) . thus , our data from the 1994 through 1996 observing seasons allow us a confidence level of 50% that an actually existing 2 r@xmath6 planet would have been detected . for a 3 r@xmath6 planet ,",
    "a similar test gave 90% confidence .",
    "we would like to note , that one transit candidate reported by our group ( @xcite ) turned out to result from a problem with the flatfielding of that night s images .",
    "there were also reports ( @xcite , 1997 ) of cm dra being fainter by 0.08 mag throughout the whole night of june 1 , 1996 .",
    "if this event would have been caused by a planet with about 0.94 jupiter diameters , the long duration of the transit would indicate a planet with an orbital period of about 2.2 years .",
    "for such long periodic planets , the probability that their orbital plane crosses in front of cm dra , as well as the probability of catching a transit at the right time , are both very low .",
    "most important however , such a planet should have caused periodic variations in the minimum times of cm dra s primary eclipse of over 10 seconds , which have _ not _ been detected ( see sect .",
    "we never encountered any brightness variations this large and this long in duration ( the latter would have been due to our reduction procedure , where we set the brightness of cm dra relative to its reference stars to zero for each night ) .",
    "our data are therefore less sensitive to slow - changing atmospheric extinction variations but would miss unusually long transits that began before _ and _ ended after the nightly observations . however , since none of the reference stars anywhere near the field has a red color similar to cm dra , relative brightness changes may have been caused by differential color extinction .",
    "in addition , guinan et al.s observations were done in i band , which is notorious for variations caused by oh@xmath7 in the atmosphere .",
    "we believe therefore , that the event reported by them was most likely caused by a night with abnormal extinction , or was due to a flatfielding problem .",
    "the tep network has embarked on obtaining extended observational coverage of the eclipsing m star binary cm dra with the goal of detecting transits of planets which are orbiting in the plane of the binary components .",
    "reported here are the data from the first three years of this project , covering the years 1994 through 1996 .",
    "time series of about 200 hours coverage were obtained in each year of observations , containing a total of 17176 data points .",
    "this gives the most thorough coverage of any binary eclipsing star observed to date . in this coverage",
    "we observed six events in which the brightness of cm dra dropped between 0.004 mag and 0.01 mag over a time scale of an hour .",
    "these events are compatible with planetary transits , but their true nature can only be ascertained by further observational coverage .",
    "the absence of any light drops larger than 0.01 mag allows us to rule out the presence of close planets with radii of larger than 2.5 r@xmath6 ( corresponding to about 1.1% the volume of jupiter ) , with a confidence of 80% for orbital periods of less than 60 days .",
    "the confidence is 98% that such planets are absent with periods of less than 20 days .",
    "the light - loss events listed in table  [ tab : diplist ] are examples of what lightcurves from the transits of extrasolar planets with sizes between 1.5 and 2.5 r@xmath6 should look like . but",
    "again , their true nature can only be confirmed by observations of repeated transits from the same planet .",
    "furthermore , the light - loss events in table  [ tab : diplist ] only contain events that are _ visible _ in the lightcurve .",
    "the typical noise in the lightcurve is 2 - 3 mmag , and events from planets smaller than about 2 r@xmath4 could be hidden in the lightcurve . such small planets ,",
    "although their transits are visually undetectable in the lightcurve , may be found by the application of a matched filter algorithm - i.e. cross - correlations with the quasi periodic signals caused by planetary transits ( @xcite ) .",
    "detection statistical calculations show , that the confidence that planets with 2r@xmath4 could be detected in the current data - _ if _ they are present - is about 50% . in conclusion , it is therefore definitively possible to use the photometric transit method with ground based 1  meter class telescopes to obtain results about the presence of extrasolar terrestrial - sized planets within a star s habitable zone . with larger telescopes and longer observing times , this method may be extended to the detection of terrestrial - like planets around many other eclipsing binary systems , as well .",
    "the tep network wishes to thank numerous people , without whose support the acquisition of these data would have been impossible .",
