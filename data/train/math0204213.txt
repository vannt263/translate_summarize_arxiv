    "the concept of _ rationally connected _",
    "variety seems to become more and more important ( see the recent book of kollar @xcite ) , clearly unirational varieties are rationally connected but whether the latter concept is more general than the former is not yet known ( ibid .",
    ", problem 55 ) .",
    "irrespectively of the answer to this question , it remains an interesting geometrical problem to decide whether certain types of varieties are unirational ( or not ! ) .",
    "one the most striking results in this subject is a _ theorem of u. morin _ from 1940 @xcite saying that ( always in characteristic zero ) if @xmath3 is a _",
    "hypersurface _ of degree @xmath2 in a projective @xmath0-space then there exists a constant @xmath4 such that if @xmath5 and if @xmath6 is  sufficiently general",
    " then @xmath6 is unirational ( see theorem [ thm2 ] below for the precise statement ) .",
    "this theorem has been generalized to _",
    "complete intersections _ by _ predonzan _ in @xcite .",
    " modern  treatments of the results of morin and predonzan were given in the papers of ciliberto @xcite , ramero @xcite , paranjape - srinivas @xcite and we refer also to chap . 10 in the book of iskovskikh @xcite .",
    "recently the result of morin has been improved by harris , mazur and pandharipande @xcite in the sense that ",
    "sufficiently general  has been relaxed to  smooth  , this is an important improvement but - as far as we know - this result of @xcite for hypersurfaces has not yet been extended to complete intersections .",
    "a natural question is whether the result of morin can be extended to _ double covers _",
    "@xmath7\\longrightarrow \\p^r$ ] of @xmath8 ramified over an hypersurface @xmath9 of degree @xmath1 ; i.e. , whether there exists a constant @xmath10 such that if @xmath11 and @xmath12 is  sufficiently general ",
    "the variety @xmath13 $ ] is unirational . in the above quoted paper @xcite ciliberto",
    "has given a beautiful idea ( osservazione 3.6 ) how to proceed to prove such a theorem ( reducing it to a general criterion given by morin in his torino lecture of 1954 @xcite ) .",
    "however , as ciliberto remarks himself , the details of his outline depend upon a number of rather subtle verifications of  algebraic  nature .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give these details and to prove the theorem for double covers ; the precise statement is theorem [ thm3 ] below .",
    "our starting point is the theorem of morin - predonzan in the version of ciliberto , see for the precise statement theorem [ thm2 ] below .",
    "there are in the theorems of morin and predonzan ( at least ) two important , but delicate , technical points : _ firstly _ , in order to specify the field over which the unirationality occurs one needs a  sufficiently large ",
    "linear space @xmath14 contained in @xmath6 and _ secondly _ the pair @xmath15 must be  sufficiently general  . in the paper @xcite and in the book of iskovskikh one",
    "introduces the notion of  general pair  .",
    "however it is difficult to control this notion of  general pair  .",
    "on the other hand for the application of the results of morin - predonzan to the case of double covers these technical aspects play an important ( and in fact crucial ) role .",
    "therefore we have preferred to work with the precise notion of  generic  in the sense of weil @xcite or grothendieck @xcite ( although technically differently framed the notions",
    " generic  of weil and grothendieck are - of course - essentially the same ) . working with ",
    "it is important to distinguish between : ",
