    "a great deal of efforts in modern cosmology , over the course of the past decade , have been made in trying to understand the nature and the origin of dark energy which is responsible for late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "although cosmological constant is the simplest candidate of dark energy consistent with current observations , it suffers from a severe fine - tuning problem from a field theoretic point of view @xcite .",
    "it is then tempting to find alternative models of dark energy which have dynamical nature unlike cosmological constant .",
    "an accelerated expansion can be realized by using a scalar field whose origin may be found in superstring or supergravity theories .",
    "thus modern particle physics has been an attractive supplier for the construction of scalar - field dark energy models  such as quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , dilatonic models @xcite , and ghost condensate @xcite .",
    "although the dynamically evolving field models have an edge over the cosmological constant scenario , they too , in general , involve fine - tuning of initial values of the field and the parameters of the model . secondly , nucleosynthesis places stringent restriction on any additional degree of freedom ( over and above the particle physics standard model degrees of freedom ) which translates into a constraint on the ratio of the field energy density to the energy density of the background fluid @xcite .",
    "these problems can be addressed by employing scalar field models exhibiting _ scaling solutions _ @xcite .",
    "for instance , a standard scalar field @xmath0 with an exponential potential in general relativity ( gr ) @xcite can mimic the background ( radiation / matter ) remaining sub - dominant so as to respect the nucleosynthesis constraint @xcite .",
    "the scaling solutions as dynamical attractors can successfully address the second problem and can also considerably alleviate the fine - tuning problem of initial conditions .    for a viable cosmological evolution ,",
    "the scalar field should remain unimportant for most of the cosmic evolution and should emerge from the hiding epoch only at late times to give rise to the accelerated expansion .",
    "since scaling solutions are non - accelerating , the model should be supplemented by an additional mechanism allowing the field to exit from the scaling regime at late times .",
    "there are several ways of achieving this goal :    * \\(i ) at late times the potential becomes shallow to lead to the accelerated expansion .",
    "for example this is realized by the double exponential potential given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite ( here @xmath11 with @xmath12 being gravitational constant ) . *",
    "\\(ii ) a local minimum of the field potential appears at late times .",
    "the examples of this type of models are @xmath13^n$ ] @xcite and @xmath14 $ ] @xcite . in the former case",
    "the acceleration occurs for @xmath15 on average , whereas in the latter case the system always approaches a de - sitter universe after a damped oscillation of the field . *",
    "\\(iii ) assisted quintessence @xcite .",
    "this is realized by considering many fields @xmath16 with the sum of the exponential potential @xmath17 , since the presence of many scalar fields leads to the smaller effective coupling , i.e. , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "although these are interesting attempts to provide a successful exit from the scaling regime , it is fair to say that the aforementioned mechanisms are still phenomenological .",
    "it is of great importance to find cosmological models from fundamental theories of particle physics like string theory which may incorporate the findings of the phenomenological studies .",
    "string theory necessarily includes scalar fields ( dilaton @xmath19 modulus fields ) ; the low energy string effective action also gives rise to a modification of standard gr in terms of riemann invariants coupled to scalar field(s ) @xcite .",
    "the modifications are important to address the problems of past @xcite and future @xcite singularities . out of these corrections ,",
    "the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term is of a special relevance .",
    "the gb term is a topological invariant quantity which contributes to the dynamics in 4 dimensions provided it is coupled to a dynamically evolving scalar field .",
    "it is the unique invariant for which the highest ( second ) derivative occurs linearly in the equations of motion thereby ensuring the uniqueness of solutions .",
    "@xcite studied scalar - gauss - bonnet cosmology to demonstrate the existence of a particular dark energy solution .",
    "such a solution exists in the presence of an exponential potential @xmath20 and the gb coupling @xmath21 .",
    "more recently koivisto and mota @xcite showed that the gb coupling allows a possibility to lead to the exit from the scaling matter era to the dark energy dominated universe for the same model .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for other aspects of the gb dark energy scenario .",
    "in this paper we shall clarify the form of the gb coupling @xmath22 for the existence of scaling solutions by starting from a very general scalar - field lagrangian density @xmath1 where @xmath23 is a kinematic term of the field .",
    "this includes a wide variety of scalar - field models such as quintessence , k - essence , tachyon , and ghost condensate .",
    "the demand for scaling solutions not only determines the field lagrangian to be @xmath24 ( @xmath6 is an arbitrary function ) but also fixes the gb coupling in the form @xmath3 ( here we use the unit @xmath25 ) . thus our results are useful to construct viable dark energy models which possess scaling solutions in the matter - dominated epoch .",
    "we then investigate the fixed points for the scaling lagrangian @xmath24 with a gb coupling @xmath7 .",
    "we show the existence of a pure de - sitter fixed point which exists only for specific models and study a possibility to obtain a scaling matter era that finally approaches the de - sitter solution .",
    "a standard field with an exponential potential is a specific model to realize such a cosmological evolution provided that @xmath26 .",
    "a tachyon field also possesses the de - sitter fixed point , but it does not have a scaling matter epoch .",
    "however the scaling matter era followed by the de - sitter solution is possible if dark energy couples to dark matter .",
    "we shall discuss cosmological dynamics in such cases in details .",
    "the model we study is given by the following action @xmath27 + s_{m}[\\phi,\\psi_{i},g_{\\mu\\nu}],\\label{eqn : action}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a metric determinant , @xmath29 is a ricci scalar , @xmath1 is a lagrangian density in terms of a scalar field @xmath0 and a kinematic energy @xmath30 .",

    "the hubble parameter satisfies the constraint equation : [ hubble ] 3h^2=_m++24f ( ) h^3 .",
    "then the energy density of the gb term is given by @xmath44 .",
    "we define the fractional densities of the field @xmath0 , the gb term , and the matter fluid , respectively , as _ , _ 8f ( ) h , _",

    "<S> we also derive fixed points for such a scaling lagrangian with a gb coupling @xmath7 and clarify the conditions under which the scaling matter era is followed by a de - sitter solution which can appear in the presence of the gb coupling . among scaling models proposed in the current literature , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the models which allow such a cosmological evolution are an ordinary scalar field with an exponential potential and a tachyon field with an inverse square potential , although the latter requires a coupling between dark energy and dark matter . </S>"
