    "in general most physicists will almost instinctively associate a non - hermitian hamiltonian with unstable states , decaying wavefunctions , resonances and dissipation .",
    "such type of systems have been studied for a long time .",
    "they arise for instance when coupling channels in a system in which the wavefunctions factorize into functions which depend on separate sets of variables .",
    "the effective hamiltonians resulting in this manner are non - hermitian and have _ complex _",
    "eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "however , one should note that hermiticity of the hamiltonian is only a sufficient condition , which guarantees real eigenvalues and the conservation of probability densities .",
    "it needs to be emphasized that it is not a necessary condition and there could be non - hermitian hamiltonians with _",
    "real _ discrete eigenvalue spectra , which then constitute potential candidates for physical applications , such as for instance atomic systems without decay .",
    "precisely such type of hamiltonian systems are currently under intense investigation ( for a collection of recent results see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the central question in this context is of course how to obtain a consistent quantum mechanical framework .",
    "so far much effort has gone into the study of time - independent eigenvalue problems .",
    "the main question we wish to address here is how to couple an external time - dependent electric field to a non - hermitian hamiltonian with real eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : for the benefit of the non - expert and the audience of this conference we commence in section ii with a brief reviewlike introduction by recalling some by now well - known facts and arguments on the consistent quantum mechanical formulation of non - hermitian hamiltonian systems . in section",
    "a we review the time - independent formulation starting with a discussion of how to determine the appropriate domain for a non - hermitian hamiltonian from the choice of asymptotic boundary condition .",
    "in part 2 of this section we explain the limited role played by @xmath3-symmetry . in part 3 of section",
    "a we explain how pseudo - hermiticity can be employed to map almost all relevant problems in the non - hermitian scenario to a hermitian system in the same equivalence class .",
    "the two systems obtained in this manner are therefore isospectral . in section",
    "b we discuss how this formalism can be extended to include an evolution in time .",
    "we describe here gauge transformations , perturbation theory and how to compute various physical quantities in the non - hermitian setting . in section iii",
    "we discuss two methods of how to solve one of the key problems in this context , namely how to compute pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "section iv contains three explicit examples to which the formulation from the previous sections applies : i ) the generalized swanson hamiltonians , which constitute non - hermitian extensions of anharmonic oscillators , ii ) the spiked harmonic oscillator , which exhibits explicit supersymmetry and iii ) the @xmath1-potential , which serves as a toy model for the quantum field theoretical @xmath2-theory .",
    "we state our conclusions and an outlook to further problems in section v.",
    "the current interest in this subject was triggered eight years ago @xcite by the at the time rather surprising numerical observation that the hamiltonian @xmath4 defined on a suitable domain possesses a real positive and discrete eigenvalue spectrum for integers @xmath5 with positive real coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "this property holds despite it being non - hermitian @xmath7 and unbounded from below , for @xmath8 with @xmath9 . throughout this paper",
    "we use atomic units @xmath10 .",
    "viewing now @xmath11 in ( [ 1 ] ) as a differential operator in position space acting on some wavefunction @xmath12 , one needs to specify appropriate boundary conditions in order to select a meaningful domain . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the natural boundary condition , @xmath13 exponentially for @xmath14 , requires that one continues the eigenvalue problem into the complex @xmath15-plane .",
    "in fact , for @xmath11 in ( [ 1 ] ) it was found that the wedges bounded by the stokes lines in which this boundary condition holds are given by@xmath16 where @xmath17 . to see",
    "this one can follow the procedure for an asymptotic expansion of a differential operator as outlined for instance in @xcite . substituting @xmath18 into the eigenvalue equation @xmath19 yields @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 with infinity being an irregular singular point one may assume that @xmath22 .",
    "for large @xmath15 we can also neglect @xmath23 in comparison with the potential and obtain @xmath24 in order to extract the dominating exponential factor in @xmath12 and to achieve @xmath13 for @xmath14 , we require @xmath25 . with @xmath17",
    "this is equivalent to@xmath26 which amounts to the conditions ( [ we1 ] ) , ( [ we2 ] ) for the left and the right wedge @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "of course ( [ sin ] ) allows for many more solutions and therefore possible wedges , but the selection criterion for ( [ we1 ] ) , ( [ we2 ] ) is to reproduce the conventional wedge for the harmonic oscillator for @xmath29 , which is centered around the real axis .",
    "this means the domain of integration , which makes the eigenvalue problem of the non - hermitian hamiltonian operator in ( [ 1 ] ) in position space well defined for the asymptotic boundary condition @xmath13 exponentially for @xmath14 is any path in the complex @xmath15-plane which remains inside the wedges @xmath27 and @xmath28 when it approaches complex infinity .",
    "this means any path parameterized as @xmath30 with @xmath31 , which",
    "satisfies@xmath32\\in\\mathcal{w}_{r / l}%\\ ] ] guarantees the appropriate boundary condition , namely exponential decay at infinity of the wavefunction @xmath12 . for various purposes , for instance when one is concerned about a fast numerical convergence , one can also determine the anti - stokes lines , that is the domain on which the wavefunction vanishes most rapidly , see e.g. @xcite . for @xmath11 in ( [ 1 ] )",
    "the anti - stokes angles @xmath33 are just in the centre of @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "permissible domains are therefore usually some form of parameterizations for hyperbolae . for instance a modified version of a parameterization used in @xcite was suggested in @xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "this clearly satisfied the required asymptotic@xmath36=\\theta_{r / l}^{as}(n)\\in \\mathcal{w}_{r / l}(n).\\ ] ] for all values of @xmath37 .",
    "however , as we shall discuss in more detail in section iv certain manipulations depend crucially on the suitable choice of the parameterization and one needs various alternatives .",
    "the selection procedure for what is most `` appropriate '' is largely left to inspired guess work at this stage . as we shall see below , an extremely useful variation of ( [ z1 ] )",
    "was provided in @xcite@xmath38 with@xmath39{c}% \\lim\\limits_{x\\rightarrow\\infty}\\arg[z_{2}(x)]=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\in \\mathcal{w}_{r}(n)\\\\ \\lim\\limits_{x\\rightarrow-\\infty}\\arg[z_{2}(x)]=\\frac{-3\\pi}{4}\\in \\mathcal{w}_{l}(n ) \\end{array } ~\\ ] ] for @xmath40 .",
    "another permissible parameterization can be found for instance  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the above discussion with some examples in figure 1 :    figure 1 : stoke wedges in which the eigenfunctions of @xmath11 in ( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath41 vanish exponentially when @xmath42 .",
    "permissible paths @xmath43 with a=1 and @xmath44 as parameterized in ( [ z1 ] ) and ( [ z2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the stokes lines are depicted as dotted lines in the figure .",
    "so how can one explain such unconventional behaviour that a non - hermitian hamiltonian possesses a real eigenvalue spectrum ?",
    "shortly after the above mentioned observation it was suggested that the reality of the spectrum should be attributed to unbroken @xmath0-symmetry @xcite , that is the validity of the _ two _",
    "relations@xmath45   = 0\\quad\\text{and\\quad}\\mathcal{pt}\\phi=\\phi , \\label{pt}%\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a square integrable eigenfunction on some domain of @xmath11 . in other words , when the hamiltonian _ and _ the wavefunction remain invariant under a simultaneous parity transformation @xmath47 and time reversal @xmath48@xmath39{llll}% \\mathcal{p } : & ~p\\rightarrow - p\\quad\\quad & z\\rightarrow - z & \\\\ \\mathcal{t } : & ~p\\rightarrow - p & z\\rightarrow z & i\\rightarrow - i\\\\ \\mathcal{pt } : & ~p\\rightarrow p & z\\rightarrow - z\\quad\\quad & i\\rightarrow - i , \\end{array } \\label{ptpt}%\\ ] ] the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are real . as an example",
    "one sees that obviously the hamiltonian in equation ( [ 1 ] ) is @xmath0-symmetric .",
    "what is less straightforward to see is that for @xmath49 the second relation in ( [ pt ] ) does not hold .",
    "analytic arguments , which establish these facts for the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) may be found in @xcite .",
    "we shall now outline to what extend @xmath0-symmetry can be utilized .",
    "clearly @xmath50 and the last relation in ( [ ptpt ] ) implies that the @xmath0-operator is an anti - linear operator , i.e.  it acts as @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath11 with eigenenergies @xmath23 , @xmath19 .",
    "the anti - linear nature of the @xmath0-operator serves well to establish the reality of the spectrum , i.e.  @xmath54 , when _ both _ relations in ( [ pt ] ) hold .",
    "this follows simply from@xmath55 unfortunately , the anti - linearity is also responsible for the possibility that only the first identity in ( [ pt ] ) could hold , but not the second . in this situation one",
    "speaks of a broken @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "the argument leading to this is straightforward @xcite : let us consider first a unitary operator @xmath56 for which by definition@xmath57 holds for all eigenfunctions @xmath53 of @xmath11 . from equation ( [ u ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath58 with @xmath59 for all @xmath60 , which means that a unitary operator has only one dimensional representations .",
    "this property changes for anti - unitary operators @xmath61 , as in that case only @xmath62 is a unitary operator , which can be seen from@xmath63 now we can only deduce from ( [ a ] ) that @xmath64 with @xmath65 for all @xmath60 and this means that an anti - unitary ( which is implied by anti - linearity ) operator could have a two dimensional representation @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "indeed when @xmath68 is purely imaginary one can not construct a linear combination @xmath69 with @xmath52 of the two so - called flipping states @xmath53 , which remains invariant under the action of @xmath61 .",
    "we see that@xmath70 implies that @xmath71 , @xmath72 and therefore @xmath73 .",
    "this means that only for @xmath74 the two - dimensional representation is reducible and for purely complex @xmath68 it is irreducible . in the latter situation the second relation in ( [ pt ] ) does therefore not hold . from ( [ 44 ] ) we see that @xmath75 is an eigenfunction of @xmath11 with eigenvalue @xmath76 when @xmath46 is an eigenfunction of @xmath11 with eigenvalue @xmath23 .",
    "thus when the second relation in ( [ pt ] ) does not hold the eigenvalues of @xmath11 come in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "thus @xmath0-symmetry is merely a fairly good guiding principle and serves to identify immediately potentially interesting non - hermitian hamiltonian systems .",
    "however , as argued above the @xmath0-symmetry of @xmath11 does not constitute a guarantee for a real eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "it remains an open question at this stage to determine under which circumstances the @xmath0-symmetry is broken , albeit for hamiltonians acting in a finite dimensional hilbert space an algorithm based on stability theory has been provided @xcite .",
    "in addition one should stress , that @xmath0-symmetry can not be regarded as the fundamental property , which explains always the reality of the spectrum for non - hermitian hamiltonian systems as there exist also examples with real spectra for which not even the hamiltonian is @xmath0-symmetric @xcite ( see also examples below ) .",
    "in fact , more fundamental is the necessary and sufficient condition that the hamiltonian must be hermitian with regard to _ some _ positive definite inner product @xcite as we shall discuss next .",
    "we summarize the role played by @xmath0-symmetry in figure 2 :    figure 2 : @xmath0-symmetry and real eigenvalues      the formal question of how to establish a consistent quantum mechanical formalism for non - hermitian hamiltonian systems has already been discussed in @xcite prior to the above mentioned numerical observation . in fact",
    "the possibility of extending a hilbert space by a new intermediate state , which then leads to an indefinite metric has already preoccupied particle physicists more than half a century ago @xcite . some of these old results have recently been re - discovered and developed further .",
    "as already mentioned hermiticity is a useful property as it guarantees the reality of the spectrum .",
    "let us briefly recall this standard argument and discuss how it needs to be altered for the present scenario .",
    "suppose we have a diagonalizable hermitian ( symmetric ) operator @xmath77 with regard to the conventional inner product @xmath78 we use here hermiticity in the sense that it implies self - adjointness and ignore possible subtleties , which might arise from domain issues .",
    "in general we understand here the domain to be the entire real axis .",
    "multiplying next the eigenvalue equations@xmath79 by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , we obtain@xmath82 taking the difference between ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) thus implies for @xmath83 that hermiticity of @xmath77 with regard to the standard positive - definite inner product @xmath84 , i.e.  the validity of ( [ herm ] ) , is a sufficient condition for the energies @xmath85 to be real .",
    "taking next @xmath86 hermiticity then also implies the orthogonality of the states @xmath87 for all @xmath88 .",
    "it turns out that for non - hermitian operators we only need to change the definition for the inner product , i.e.  change the metric , to draw the same conclusions @xcite .",
    "taking now the domains as discussed in section 3 , by definition we obviously no longer have @xmath89 for a non - hermitian operator @xmath11 with @xmath90 obeying the eigenvalue equation @xmath91 therefore there is no guarantee for the reality of the spectrum and neither for the orthogonality .",
    "however , assuming @xmath92 to be a hermitian operator with respect to the standard inner product , we can define a new inner product @xmath93 supposing now that @xmath11 is hermitian with regard to this new inner product@xmath94 we may employ exactly the same arguments as above and ensure the reality of the spectrum as well as the orthogonality @xmath95 . note that with regard to the standard inner product one finds in general that @xmath96 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "what is left is to characterize in more detail and possibly to determine is the metric operator @xmath97 .",
    "mostafazadeh @xcite proposed to assume that @xmath11 is a pseudo - hermitian operator satisfying @xmath98 where @xmath92 is the hermitian operator with regard to the standard inner product as introduced above . since the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath77 and the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath11",
    "are related by a similarity transformation , they belong to the same similarity class and therefore have the same eigenvalues .",
    "the corresponding time - independent schrdinger equations are then simply ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) , where the corresponding wavefunctions are related as @xmath99 having real eigenvalues for the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath77 then guarantees by construction the same real eigenspectrum also for @xmath11 .",
    "in fact the necessary and sufficient condition ( [ 2 ] ) , which ensures the reality of the spectrum for @xmath11 follows then from ( [ herm ] ) @xmath100    clearly , when @xmath92 is hermitian with regard to the standard inner product it is also hermitian with regard to the @xmath92-inner product ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "a particular example for an @xmath92-inner product is the one introduced in @xcite @xmath101 where the new operator @xmath102 , with @xmath103 , @xmath104=0 $ ] and @xmath105=0 $ ] , is employed . in position space",
    "it reads @xmath106 .",
    "the operators @xmath102 and @xmath97 are simply related as @xmath107 .",
    "in addition one should stress that in fact these inner products can also be derived @xcite when starting from a biorthonormal basis , which is quite common to use in the study of non - hermitian hamiltonian systems with complex eigenvalues , that is decaying states , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "crucial for a proper quantum mechanical framework is of course to clarify the nature of the physical observables . in order to be suitable for a physical interpretation",
    ", observables @xmath108 have to be hermitian operators acting in some physical hilbert space .",
    "from what has been outlined above with regard to the inner products , it is natural to take them to be hermitian with respect to the new @xmath92-inner product@xmath109 this implies immediately that when @xmath110 is an observable in the hermitian system , then @xmath111 is an observable in the non - hermitian system .",
    "this means in turn that the standard position operator @xmath112 and the momentum operators @xmath113 are in general not observable in the non - hermitian system , but rather their non - hermitian counterparts @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "clearly @xmath114 and @xmath115 satisfy the standard canonical commutation relations",
    "@xmath116   = i$ ] when @xmath117   = i$ ] . for hamiltonians",
    "@xmath118 , which admit a polynomial expansion in @xmath119 , @xmath120 , it follows then directly from ( [ sim ] ) that @xmath121 these relations serve for instance as a consistency check when we start with a given non - hermitian hamiltonian and construct its hermitian counterpart by means of a similarity transformation .",
    "moreover ( [ 89 ] ) provides a simple way to express the non - hermitian hamiltonian in terms of the canonical @xmath122-variables , which have a physical meaning for that system rather than the @xmath123-variables , which are in general meaningless in that context .",
    "in addition , one may use ( [ 89 ] ) as a principle to construct non - hermitian hamiltonians with real spectra from a given hermitian hamiltonian and a set of canonical variables and vice versa with ( [ 90 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath92 is @xmath0-symmetric in the @xmath123-variables the corresponding quantities in the non - hermitian system will be @xmath0-symmetric in the @xmath122-variables .",
    "we conclude with a final comment in regard to the uniqueness of the metric operator @xmath97 .",
    "in fact there are various types of ambiguities arising , which we comment on in section iii when we discuss how to compute @xmath97 explicitly . in @xcite scholtz ,",
    "geyer and hahne proved that the metric operator @xmath97 is uniquely determined on a hilbert space if and only if a set of observables @xmath124 with respect to ( [ oh ] ) is irreducible on this hilbert space .",
    "the latter means that there is no bounded operator besides the identity , which commutes with all observables @xmath124 .",
    "taking this result into account allows to move the nature of the ambiguities from the metric to the specification of the set of observables . as we shall see below a subset or even one observable",
    "might be enough in practise .",
    "let us now discuss how to couple a laser field to the non - hermitian hamiltonians @xmath11 , which have the properties described above . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "i.e.  if the parameters involved lie within a non - relativistic regime and the dipole approximation holds , such a field can be approximated by a time - dependent electric field @xmath125 . in the following",
    ", we will briefly recall our recent results on the temporal evolution of the resulting system @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that @xmath125 is linearly polarized and has a finite duration @xmath126 .    within a hermitian framework and in the length gauge",
    ", such an evolution is described by the  time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the stark - losurdo hamiltonian @xcite . for a pulse of finite duration , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "we assume here that @xmath77 possesses a non - hermitian counterpart @xmath11 which is in the same equivalence class , i.e.  the validity of the first relation in ( [ sim ] ) .",
    "the central quantity of interest in this context is the time - evolution operator @xmath131 which evolves a wavefunction from a time @xmath132 to @xmath133 , that is @xmath134 . in ( [ timeev ] )",
    ", @xmath135 denotes the time ordering .",
    "one should note that , in general , @xmath136   .$ ] in fact , such a relation only holds for hamiltonians which are not explicitly time - dependent , as is not the case for the scenario we have in mind .",
    "when @xmath137 is a self - adjoint operator in some hilbert space , @xmath138 satisfies the relations @xcite",
    "@xmath139    we will now assume that the similarity transformation @xmath92 extends to the time - dependent case .",
    "thus , @xmath140 , with @xmath141 we take @xmath92 to be time - independent .",
    "this allows us to guarantee that the relations @xmath142 for the time - evolution operator @xmath143 associated to the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath144 also hold .",
    "then this operator fulfills the condition @xmath145 which follows from @xmath146 .",
    "it is worth stressing that we make no simplifying assumption on the time dependence of the hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the only requirements involved in our approach are i ) that @xmath11 be pseudo - hermitian and ii ) that the similarity transformation @xmath92 be time - independent .",
    "such conditions guarantee that the time - dependent schrdinger equation and the relations involving the time evolution operator remain valid also in the non - hermitian case .    these conditions , however , are far more general than those normally encountered in the literature .",
    "in fact , most studies make several simplifying assumptions on the time - evolution operator , in the sense that they concentrate on hamiltonians which are either not explicitly time - dependent , or which vary adiabatically and/or periodically with time .",
    "the first scenario is addressed by either solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath147 or , at most , by employing the time - evolution operators @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "the remaining situations are widespread in the atomic physics literature , in the context of open quantum systems . roughly speaking",
    ", if a system is close to the adiabatic limit this means that it is varying so slowly that the problem can be reduced to solving eigenvalue equations of the form @xmath149 . in a standard , hermitian framework",
    ", this implies that @xmath150 , and that transitions between different time - dependent eigenstates of @xmath151 will be induced by perturbations around the adiabatic limit . specifically for a system coupled to an external laser field , the time - dependent energies @xmath152 give the field - dressed states ( for a first derivation of the adiabatic theorem and for an extension of such a theorem to non - hermitian open quantum systems , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . for periodic fields ,",
    "such a procedure is closely related to the floquet theory , for which there also exists time - dependent quasienergies .",
    "this approach may be problematic if the field varies abruptly with time , such as , for instance , if it is an ultrashort pulse .",
    "the time - evolution operators characterized in the previous subsection may then be employed to compute various quantities of physical interest , such as for instance the transition probability @xmath153 from an eigenstate @xmath154 to @xmath155 of the hermitian electric field - free hamiltonian @xmath77 or eigenstate @xmath156 to @xmath157 of the non - hermitian electric field - free hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "another physical quantity of interest is the time evolution for the expectation value of an observable in the state @xmath88 is @xmath158 in a similar way we may proceed to compute ionization rates and probabilities etc . , but these examples are sufficient to see that , as in the time - independent scenario , the relevant computations for the non - hermitian system can be translated into the hermitian one , provided the @xmath92-operator is known .      apart from employing the length - gauge hamiltonian @xmath159 , one may describe a hermitian hamiltonian system coupled to an electric field in other gauges .",
    "concrete examples are the velocity gauge , obtained by employing the minimal - coupling prescription @xmath160 , or the kramers - henneberger gauge , obtained with the shift @xmath161 in the field - free hamiltonian @xmath77 as introduced in ( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonians are given by @xmath162 and@xmath163 respectively .",
    "in equation ( [ hv ] ) and ( [ hkh ] ) , @xmath164 are the momentum transfer @xmath165 from the laser field to the system in question and the classical displacement @xmath166 in the system caused by the laser field .    depending on the problem at hand",
    ", the gauge choice may considerably facilitate the computations .",
    "for instance , the length gauge is very appropriate for perturbation theory in the electric field , as the field coupling involves only one additional term , or for physical interpretations in the low - frequency regime , since it allows the physical picture of an effective time - dependent potential .",
    "the kramers - henneberger gauge is most useful in the high - frequency regime , especially if one wishes to exploit the periodicity of the field and perform floquet expansions .",

    "in addition to the momentum transfer and classical displacement , we have also introduced the classical energy transfer @xmath173 .",

    ", we will initially consider a time - dependent hermitian hamiltonian @xmath181 , where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are also hermitian and satisfy the time - dependent schrdinger equation . using the du hamel formula @xcite , we can express the time - evolution operator@xmath184 associated to @xmath185 as @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the time evolution operator with respect to @xmath182 .",
    "equation ( [ duhamel1 ] ) can then be solved iteratively to an arbitrary order in @xmath188 which will be the perturbation . roughly speaking if  @xmath189 , the series obtained by such means has a great chance to converge .",

    "it should be mentioned that there are also other possibilities to evaluate the similarity transformations , such as for instance suggested in @xcite or directly by using properties of differential equations @xcite .",
    "let us now demonstrate with some concrete examples how the above mentioned formalism can be applied .",
    "non - hermitian hamiltonians may arise for various different reasons . in the following we provide three such examples , which all arise from quite different argumentations and thus provide several types of motivations to study non - hermitian hamiltonian systems .",
    "one type of non - hermitian hamiltonian system arises form a purely mathematical consideration simply by perturbing a hermitian hamiltonian by adding a non - hermitian term .",
    "we start with a straightforward example , which results when perturbing the anharmonic oscillators@xmath257 for @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "defining now the hermitian operators @xmath260 with @xmath261 for @xmath262 it is straightforward to compute that@xmath263 for all @xmath264 . with ( [ 23])-([25 ] ) the generic expressions ( [ hhh ] ) and ( [ hh ] ) yield with @xmath265 @xmath266 which are related according to the first relation in ( [ sim ] ) . in the special case @xmath267 ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath268 becomes the swanson hamiltonian discussed in @xcite upon some change in the conventions for the coupling constants .",
    "this hamiltonian arises in the second quantization @xmath269 where the @xmath270 are coupling constants and @xmath271 , @xmath272 are the usual creation and annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "the sequence of hamiltonians ( [ hgs ] ) illustrates our assertion on the limitations of @xmath0-symmetry in section ii a 1 , that there are non - hermitian hamiltonians with real energy spectra which are , however , not @xmath0-symmetric . as one easily sees @xmath273",
    "is not @xmath0-symmetric when @xmath204 is odd , but still has a hermitian counterpart and therefore real eigenvalues .",
    "let us next assume that we had simply given the non - hermitian hamiltonian and we wanted to compute the @xmath92-operator .",
    "for instance , for @xmath274 and @xmath275 the corresponding equations ( [ he ] ) become@xmath276 respectively .",
    "both equations are easily solved by @xmath277 , thus confirming our previous calculation .",
    "having the operator @xmath278 at hand we compute from ( [ obs ] ) the observables which correspond to the position and momentum operator in the non - hermitian systems @xmath279 as @xmath280 respectively .",
    "then it is easily verified that indeed ( [ 89 ] ) , ( [ 90 ] ) and ( [ gaugenonherm ] ) hold .    with regard to the uniqueness of this solution",
    "one can see that the first equation in ( [ 65 ] ) is also solved by @xmath281 .",
    "in fact for what has been remarked at the end of the last section , it is clear that there should be more solutions corresponding to @xmath282 , with @xmath283 being some arbitrary well behaved function restricted by the demand that @xmath284 remains a bounded function .",
    "@xmath286 for @xmath287 . to see that other choices for @xmath288 will also lead to solutions of ( [ 65 ] ) is less straightforward as we have to turn the operator valued expressions for @xmath289 first into real valued functions before we can verify ( [ 65 ] ) .",
    "let us next illustrate how to fix the ambiguities by an explicit choice of the observables in the non - hermitian system , which is always possible for what has been said at the end of section ii a. demanding for instance that  @xmath290 should be an observable in the non - hermitian system , it follows immediately that the only choice for @xmath288 is @xmath291 and therefore ( [ xx ] ) is the corresponding set of canonical variables . in turn",
    "we could also choose @xmath292 to be an observable , which leads to @xmath286 and @xmath293 .",
    "for @xmath294 it is not possible choose @xmath292 to be an observable as one can not find a function @xmath288 such that @xmath295 becomes a function of @xmath113 only .",
    "a further interesting example is the spiked harmonic oscillator as it exhibits an explicit supersymmetry @xcite and therefore also phenomena like degeneracy of the energy eigenvalues and even level crossings .",
    "the hermitian version of this hamiltonian is simply @xmath296 this example is very instructive as it is exactly solvable . the normalized eigenfunctions are@xmath297 where the @xmath298 denote the generalized laguerre polynomials and the eigenenergies are@xmath299 clearly there is a degeneracy of the energy levels for @xmath300 .",
    "the standard harmonic oscillator hamiltonian results from ( [ hh ] ) for @xmath301 .",
    "the corresponding wavefunctions are related to ( [ phia ] ) as @xmath302 , @xmath303 .",
    "the motivation here to introduce an hermitian counterpart for this hamiltonian is that one wishes to regularize the singularity of the potential at @xmath304 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "with @xmath305 one easily produces the desired shift and with ( [ sim ] ) one obtains@xmath306 this is an example for which the moyal products are not very suitable for the computations as the last term in the potential of ( [ hxp ] ) is responsible for the fact that the related differential equations are of infinite order .",
    "nonetheless , commutators are easily evaluated in this case and for instance the canonical variables for the non - hermitian system are computed in a rather trivial way , resulting to@xmath307 once again we verify ( [ 89 ] ) and ( [ 90 ] ) for consistency .",
    "figure 3 : transition probability for the spiked harmonic oscillator , as functions of the field frequency @xmath308 and different parameters @xmath309 introduced in ( [ hxp ] ) .",
    "we consider the transition from the energy level @xmath310 to @xmath311 to first - order perturbation theory with respect to the external laser field@xmath312 the field amplitude is taken to be weak @xmath313 a.u . and",
    "the coupling constant is chosen as @xmath314 .",
    "the pulse length @xmath126 and the frequency @xmath308 are indicated in the figure .",
    "as this example is completely solvable it serves well to illustrate various general features .",
    "first we use it to argue that adding @xmath208 instead of @xmath209 to @xmath11 in order to construct the non - hermitian version of the stark - losurdo hamiltonian is unphysical . to see this we compute the transition amplitude in the weak intensity regime to first order ( [ u1 ] ) , where instead of the amplitude @xmath315 we would have @xmath316 .",
    "now for ( [ xp ] ) we would have that @xmath317 for @xmath86 , such that no effect would be visible in the transition amplitude to first order .",
    "let us therefore take instead the transformation @xmath318 .",
    "we then compute the canonical variables to@xmath319 for the corresponding non - hermitian system @xmath320 we evaluate next the transition amplitude for @xmath321 with @xmath314 , subjected to a monochromatic linearly polarized electric field @xmath322 and depict the result in figure 3 .    as expected",
    "we obtain the main contribution for the transition at @xmath323 .",
    "the value @xmath324 is perfectly reasonable and corresponds to adding @xmath209 to @xmath11 , with @xmath114 given in ( [ xp ] ) for the reasons outlined above .",
    "however , for large enough values of @xmath309 we observe that the transition probability becomes larger than 1 , which is of course inconsistent and unphysical .",
    "therefore to add @xmath208 to @xmath11 is meaningless in our framework , unless @xmath112 can be chosen to be an observable in the non - hermitian system .",
    "a further interesting hamiltonian arises when we specify in equation ( [ 1 ] ) the parameter @xmath326 , which involves a potential which is unbounded from below .",
    "recently jones and mateo @xcite established that this hamiltonian is in fact isospectral to the hermitian hamiltonian@xmath327 this hamiltonian is of great interest as it serves as a simplified version for the @xmath328 quantum field theory , which may for instance be used to mimic the higgs mechanism . to obtain the hamiltonian ( [ ht ] ) from ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath326 one needs to pass via two auxiliary hamiltonians as follows @xmath329 all manipulation in ( [ step ] ) are spectrum preserving . in the first step the general idea @xcite",
    "was used to map the contour from within the wedges @xmath27 and @xmath28 back to the real axis .",
    "as discussed in section ii a 1 there are many possible parameterization , which guarantee the appropriate boundary condition .",
    "unfortunately , there is no constructive method to select out the most useful contour within the wedges and this choice remains a matter of inspired guess work @xcite . here",
    "the best choice is guided by the desire to be able to construct a similarity transformation @xmath92 , which maps the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath11 adjointly into a hermitian hamiltonian @xmath77 .",
    "hitherto , this procedure was only successful in an exact manner for the class of hamiltonians in ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath326 , in which case @xmath92 can be constructed exactly either by operator methods @xcite , differential - equation techniques @xcite or moyal products @xcite . even for the next example",
    "@xmath330 the same transformation used as in @xcite does not yield an exact similarity transformation @xcite .",
    "the last step in ( [ step ] ) in the case @xmath326 is to transform @xmath77 into the hamiltonian @xmath331 ( [ ht ] ) via a fourier transformation .",
    "concretely , we exchange now the constant @xmath6 by @xmath23 in ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath326 and obtain @xmath332 thereafter .",
    "using now the parameterization @xmath333 as defined in ( [ z1 ] ) one obtains the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath334 the domain of @xmath335is now the entire real axis , where @xmath336 and the coupling constant @xmath6 has been introduced to separate off the non - hermitian part @xcite .",
    "next we want to compute @xmath92 by means of moyal products . for this",
    "we have to convert @xmath11 first into a real valued function and have to substitute the anti - commutator with the moyal products .",
    "thus we have to replace @xmath337 by @xmath338 .",
    "subsequently we can use ( [ moy ] ) and the differential equation ( [ he ] ) for the hamiltonian ( [ aq ] ) in the unknown quantity @xmath339 becomes @xmath340 we can solve this by @xmath341 such that @xmath342 . from ( [ sim ] ) we obtain thereafter the hermitian hamiltonian@xmath343 let us compare how these expressions are obtained by means of operator identities . in principle",
    "we have to make a general ansatz to find @xmath221 , but having already found @xmath92 we can simply extract it from ( [ etaa])@xmath344 and verify the corresponding expressions . from ( [ aq ] )",
    "we find that@xmath345 next we compute the @xmath88-fold commutators@xmath346 with @xmath265 we then find that the generic expression ( [ hhh ] ) for the hermitian hamiltonian yields precisely ( [ d2 ] ) and the generic expression ( [ hh ] ) for the non - hermitian hamiltonian gives ( [ aq ] ) .    now",
    "the non - hermitian system in terms of its canonical variables @xmath347 results from @xmath348 .",
    "in addition we verify @xmath349 .",
    "in this case it suffices to choose @xmath350 as an observable to make the metric unique . note also that it is not possible to demand @xmath290 to be an observable as we can not find a function @xmath288 such that all functional dependence on @xmath113 is eliminated from the term @xmath351 .",
    "given a non - hermitian time - independent hamiltonian @xmath11 , we argued that the analogue of the stark - losurdo hamiltonian should be @xmath352 where @xmath353 is the position operator in the non - hermitian system .",
    "as we have shown when we simply add @xmath208 to @xmath11 , we obtain unphysical results unless @xmath112 is an observable in the non - hermitian system .",
    "however , we also demonstrated that this is not always possible and @xmath112 is often degraded to be a mere auxiliary variable in the non - hermitian system .",
    "as in the time - independent scenario we saw that once the similarity transformation is known , one can easily translate all the relevant calculations into the hermitian system .",
    "the situation is less straightforward when the transformation @xmath92 and therefore the hermitian system is not known . in that case",
    "one may take our expressions as benchmarks and think of various different approximation schemes , such as standard perturbation theory , a perturbation via the @xmath102-operator , floquet type approximations for periodic potentials etc .    from what has been said one",
    "may adopt a rather pessimistic standpoint and conclude that in the end the non - hermitian formulation is in most cases a mere change of metric of a well posed hermitian problem . nonetheless , even leaving the technical difficulty aside to establish the precise relation between these conceptually different formulations ,",
    "it has been successfully argued that the non - hermitian formulation is often more natural and simplifies computations @xcite .",
    "for an atomic physicist this is of course a natural scenario when we compare these alternative formulations with treatments in various gauges , which are also just different ways to express the same physical quantity .",
    "it is a well established fact that different choices of gauges often drastically simplify problems in that context and allow for a more intuitive interpretation .",
    "for instance , tunneling processes can be visualized and interpreted more easily in the length gauge formulation , since then one may picture the problem in terms of a time - dependent effective potential barrier , whereas all other gauges would obscure this intuitive physical interpretation .",
    "furthermore , phenomena occurring in the context of high frequency fields are most intuitively understood when viewed in a time - dependent dichotomous potential in the kramers - henneberger gauge    let us conclude by commenting on some of the immediate open problems , which follow from what we discussed . concerning the time - dependent treatment it would be interesting to change the current set - up by allowing @xmath92 to be time - dependent .",
    "having entirely focussed on the pseudo - hermitian nature of the hamiltonians involved , we want to conclude with a final comment on the role played by @xmath0-symmetry in the time - dependent setting .",
    "when @xmath354=0 $ ] the term @xmath209 is only @xmath0-symmetric when @xmath355 .",
    "this means that @xmath0-symmetry depends on the explicit form of the laser pulse .",
    "taking for instance a typical pulse for a laser field with frequency @xmath308 , amplitude @xmath356 and gaussian enveloping function @xmath357 , that is of the form @xmath358 , the term @xmath208 would be @xmath0-invariant . however , the perfectly legitimate replacement @xmath359 @xmath360 @xmath361 in this field would break the @xmath0-invariance . recall that in this context the electric field is treated classically . for a discussion of @xmath362-symmetry for a full quantum electrodynamic setting we may refer to @xcite .",
    "however , for the physical applications we dealt with in this manuscript , @xmath0-invariance is not a relevant issue , since the pulse is always chosen such that @xmath363 and @xmath364 .",
