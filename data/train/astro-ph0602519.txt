    "the problem of the internal dynamics of galaxies is a very old one .",
    "it is of special interest because observed non - keplerian ( henceforth `` flat '' ) rotation curves @xcite apparently contradict the simple newtonian results .",
    "these observational facts are usually interpreted in favor of changing the matter model , i.e.  introducing dark matter that accounts for the difference between prediction and `` experiment '' , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , one might also shift the burden to the gravitational theory itself .",
    "the most radical change in this line of arguments would result in avoiding dark matter altogether , as for example in modified newtonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "so far these alternatives typically are at least as unsatisfactory as the dark matter hypothesis itself , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "taking a closer look at the usual approach , it is newtonian gravity rather than general relativity ( gr ) that is applied to the situation of gravitational dynamics of galaxies . because the velocity of the stars within a galaxy is small as compared to the speed of light and since the gravitational field is very weak ( at least a couple of schwarzschild radii away from a central galactic black hole @xcite ) the newtonian approximation seems to be sufficient .",
    "however , one has to be careful with such arguments .",
    "for instance , it is clear that corrections from gr are smaller in regions where gravity is weaker  and yet , the gr distortion of the elliptic orbit of mercury visually is most pronounced in the aphelion , and not in the perihelion , although gravity is weaker in the former .",
    "it is the main purpose of this paper to show that indeed the newtonian approximation breaks down , even though it might be valid locally everywhere in the galaxy .",
    "the idea to use gr rather than the newtonian approximation to describe the internal dynamics of galaxies appears to go back to a relatively recent paper by cooperstock and tieu @xcite .",
    "several errors were pointed out in subsequent publications , cf .",
    "@xcite and [ app : b ] .",
    "so it is fair to say that ref .",
    "@xcite caused a lot of confusion , interest and critical comments @xcite .",
    "actually , the approach of taking the non - linear character of gr more serious fits quite well to similar considerations on a cosmological scale @xcite . having a simple framework for",
    "the construction of exact solutions at our disposal helps to clarify these important issues .",
    "the prime goal of this paper is to provide and discuss such a framework and to point out where and why the newtonian approximation breaks down .",
    "we do not discriminate between elliptic , spiral or irregular galaxies , but it is clear that some galaxies will obey the subsequent physical idealizations better than others .",
    "order of magnitude estimates reveal that there are no relevant forces besides gravity in the description of intragalactic dynamics at the percent level .",
    "the matter content of a galaxy can be modeled very well by a pressureless perfect fluid .",
    "the approximation of vanishing pressure is applicable in the whole galaxy , aside from the very center where a galactic black hole may be located and a region close to the rotation axis where jets might be emitted . additionally , stationarity and axial symmetry will be imposed , which is reasonable for many galaxies .",
    "this implies the existence of two killing vectors and considerably simplifies the geometry .",
    "we are thus interested in axially symmetric stationary solutions of the einstein equations ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) @xmath3 with the energy momentum tensor @xmath4 where @xmath5 are mass density and 4-velocity , respectively .      theorem 7.1.1 of @xcite",
    "( the premises of which apply to the case under consideration ) guarantees that , without loss of generality , the line element can be brought into the following form : @xmath6 all functions @xmath7 depend solely on the non - killing coordinates @xmath8 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath9 is @xmath10-periodic .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath11 is determined by the killing norm of the timelike killing vector @xmath12 .",
    "we are not interested in inside solutions of black holes here , whence @xmath13 is timelike globally",
    ". we shall assume the perfect fluid velocity to be co - rotating , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "so actually @xmath15 is proportional to the killing vector @xmath12 .",
    "the conservation equation @xmath16 decomposes into @xmath17 if we suppose that @xmath18 then the first equation implies geodesicity of the 4-velocity while the second one expresses stationarity of the mass distribution .",
    "this seemingly mild assumption entails that the killing vector @xmath13 has to be geodetic and hence @xmath19 is constant .",
    "this is a crucial difference to the matterless case where no such restriction arises . without loss of generality one",
    "may set @xmath20 by a rescaling of the time coordinate in regions where @xmath18 .",
    "henceforth the vacuum case will always be considered as the limit of small @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 is valid globally .",
    "we emphasize that the presence of co - rotating pressureless perfect fluid sources _ simplifies _ the dynamics as compared to the vacuum case .",
    "in addition one may set @xmath22 .",
    "the proof as given e.g.  in @xcite is valid only for the vacuum case , but one can show easily that the crucial condition @xmath23 holds still for a pressureless perfect fluid ( albeit it ceases to hold once pressure is switched on or a cosmological constant is added ) . therefore , the line element reduces to @xmath24 with the redefinition @xmath25 . from now on we shall exclusively refer to this adapted coordinate system . inserting into the einstein equations , establishes ( cf .",
    "[ app : a ] and also @xcite ) @xmath26 remarkably , the only difference to the perturbative results in @xcite is the factor @xmath27 on the right hand side in the last equation .    before solving these equations we would like to point out that the 3-velocity as seen by an asymptotic observer who is at rest with respect to the center of the galaxy is @xmath28 provided @xmath29",
    "this may be derived by a standard adm split of the line - element @xmath30 ^ 2 + e^\\nu({\\operatorname{d}\\!}r^2+{\\operatorname{d}\\!}z^2)\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : admsplit}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the standard decomposition of @xmath31 into lapse and shift obtains @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the unit normal to the @xmath34 hypersurfaces and the shift vector is proportional to @xmath35 , as expected for angular rotation .",
    "the relativistic @xmath36-factor is given by @xmath37 with .",
    "so @xmath38 is the velocity distribution of the ( co-)rotating dust as seen by an asymptotic observer who is at rest with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "the results above can be found in the classic textbook @xcite ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) , but we have reviewed them in some detail here in order to make explicit the relevance of each of our assumptions , and also because the result for the velocity is crucial for our discussion .      the strategy for solving this coupled system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) is as follows : first , we find the general solution of the linear second order pde for @xmath39 in terms of a spectral density .",
    "then we use this solution to determine @xmath40 from - up to an integration constant .",
    "finally , we solve the last equation for @xmath21 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 as input .",
    "to match with input from observations we must fix the spectral density ( and thus the function @xmath39 ) accordingly . from we see that @xmath39 is simply the velocity @xmath38 times the coordinate @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the strategy is to take @xmath38 as an input and to deduce the mass density @xmath21 , rather than the other way around .",
    "we implement now this strategy and focus in this section on .",
    "the separation ansatz @xmath42 yields @xmath43 with the separation constant @xmath44 . because of reflection symmetry @xmath45 . therefore , @xmath46 solely is composed of even modes @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath48 then these modes diverge exponentially for @xmath49 . this is unphysical behavior . in @xcite a positive value for @xmath50 _ and _ fall off behavior at infinity was achieved by employing the non - smooth modes @xmath51 , which satisfy for @xmath52 only . consequently , there are sources localized at @xmath53 .",
    "we show in [ app : b ] that either the weak energy condition is violated in the whole galactic plane or the pressure must be negative , so these sources are unphysical and contradict our assumption of vanishing pressure . thus , we have no choice but to assume @xmath54 with @xmath55 yielding the modes @xmath56 .",
    "let us address first the zero mode @xmath57 . without loss of generality @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the zero mode solution reads @xmath60 we consider first the simplest case , @xmath61 .",
    "then the velocity is given by @xmath62 and exceeds the speed of light for small @xmath41 .",
    "while this is unpleasant , we note that the einstein equations - are invariant under the constant shift @xmath63 .",
    "so the constant @xmath64 may be absorbed into a redefinition of the time variable .",
    "thus , in addition to the fall - off condition for @xmath49 exploited above and to the fall - off condition for @xmath65 exploited below we have to impose a condition to fix @xmath64 , e.g.  by requiring @xmath66 . this will be discussed in more detail below ; right now we simply fix @xmath67 . then ,",
    "if @xmath68 , the velocity profile @xmath69 is linear , as expected from newtonian gravity for a disk rotating with constant angular velocity . to get a first glimpse at possible differences between newton and einstein we consider the simplest case when only the zero mode is switched on , i.e. , @xmath70 , and restrict ourselves to the galactic plane @xmath53",
    "in newtonian gravity one obtains @xmath71 however , general relativity behaves differently : plugging @xmath72 into yields @xmath73 with negative proportionality constant .",
    "the unperturbed einstein equation establishes ( @xmath74 ) @xmath75 conceptually ( although not physically ) this is an important result : given as input the same velocity profile in the galactic plane , @xmath70 , newtonian and general relativistic calculations yield different results for the mass density , even though locally the quantity @xmath21 as given in can always be matched to the newtonian @xmath76 in by adjusting appropriately in @xmath40 the integration constant @xmath77 .",
    "thus , only for a small region of spacetime the newtonian picture is correct .",
    "however , the zero mode obviously is unphysical because for large values of @xmath41 the velocity @xmath38 would exceed the speed of light .",
    "thus , from now on we set @xmath61 , i.e. , the zero mode is dropped .      in order to get the generic modes we use the rescaled variable @xmath78 and obtain from the separation ansatz above the ordinary differential equation @xmath79 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath80 .",
    "it can be solved by standard methods .",
    "the result for @xmath81 is given by @xmath82\\,.\\ ] ] the spectral densities @xmath83 and @xmath84 may be chosen according to the behavior required of @xmath85 .",
    "the functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 are modified bessel functions of the first and second kind , respectively ( the latter is also known as macdonald function ) .",
    "we note that @xmath86 blows up exponentially for large values of @xmath41 which is unphysical .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath88 .",
    "the function @xmath87 falls off exponentially for large values of @xmath41 and diverges like @xmath89 near @xmath90 .",
    "however , this divergence is compensated by a linear prefactor , so the integrand is well defined for any sufficiently regular @xmath83 .",
    "we plot @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the technical observation @xmath92 will be very useful below .    to summarize , the general solution of consistent with physical fall - off behavior @xmath93 and with the absence of spurious sources in the galactic plane @xmath53 is given by @xmath94 the constant @xmath64 has to be fixed by some additional boundary condition , e.g.  by requiring a certain behavior of @xmath39 as @xmath95 .",
    "this can be done efficiently by setting first @xmath67 , designing a useful spectral density @xmath83 and finally shifting @xmath39 by a suitable constant .",
    "the choice of @xmath83 determines not only the radial velocity profile , but also the @xmath96-dependence of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the behavior in @xmath96-direction is determined uniquely by the behavior in @xmath41-direction and vice versa .",
    "this is good for the predictability of the model , because one may fit one kind of behavior and predict the other , in addition to predicting the matter density .",
    "instead of fixing @xmath83 directly we found it useful to perform first a fourier transformation,@xmath97 where @xmath83 is determined in terms of a ( fourier ) transformed spectral density @xmath98 .",
    "this allows to represent @xmath99 as @xmath100 with some arbitrary function @xmath98 , which we may call again spectral density. it is evident that for @xmath101 the velocity profile is linear in @xmath41 , while for @xmath102 the velocity profile is flat .",
    "therefore , this purely technical step is very useful for matching with observational data .",
    "the function @xmath103 reads    [ eq : n ] @xmath104 for @xmath90 we obtain @xmath105    provided the function @xmath106 is sufficiently well - behaved .",
    "the result for @xmath107 is obtained from reflection symmetry .    for physical applications",
    "one still has to choose the spectral density @xmath108 suitably .",
    "it is instructive to consider the case of constant @xmath108 : the function @xmath85 turns out to be constant , which is problematic because for arbitrarily small values of @xmath41 the function @xmath109 as defined in grows without bound . in model building",
    "we have encountered this feature to be generic , rather than an artifact of a particular choice of @xmath108 : if the velocity profile is taken from experimental data it turns out that for some values of @xmath96 there will always be a region close to the axis @xmath90 where @xmath38 exceeds unity .",
    "this is a clear signal of the breakdown of our assumptions . for galaxies emitting jets",
    "this is not unexpected since jets emitted along the axis are not pressureless .",
    "also the region around eventual central galactic black holes is located on the axis , so perhaps there is good ( physical ) reason for these regions not being described by a dust - like matter model .",
    "it is not the purpose of the current paper to further discuss these regions , where closed time like curves may arise , similar to the gdel universe ( the appearance of such regions appears to be a generic feature of axially symmetric stationary solutions ) .",
    "therefore , we cut out the domains where @xmath110 and blithely ignore them ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : patch ] ) .",
    "while this is clearly unsatisfactory , it appears to be not much worse than ignoring the problem with cusps in newtonian cold dark matter models .",
    "experimental data imply @xcite that for small values of @xmath41 the velocity should increase linearly with @xmath41 and for intermediate values of @xmath41 it should yield an approximately flat profile .",
    "asymptotically it should fall off like @xmath89 in order to match the kerr solution @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is required that @xmath111 is regular for @xmath112 , where the quantity @xmath113 is of the order of @xmath114 , which allows to describe also the bulge region of the galaxy within our model .    with these remarks in mind",
    "we propose a simple 3-parameter function for @xmath108 ( @xmath115 is the step function ) : @xmath116 the three parameters , @xmath117 , have to be chosen appropriately .",
    "the quantity @xmath118 is of the order of the velocity in the flat regime ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the bulge radius @xmath113 is set to @xmath120 and @xmath121 to @xmath122 .",
    "note that @xmath108 is smooth besides the points @xmath123 .",
    "we stress that a smooth version of @xmath108 may be chosen to improve the model ( and also other refinements may be implemented according to phenomenological necessities ) , but we want to keep the model simple and exactly soluble for pedagogic reasons , while still being realistic enough to be applicable to galactic physics .      from and",
    "we obtain @xmath124 it may be checked that indeed satisfies up to some distributional contributions at @xmath125 . the latter lie in the region we are not capable to describe .",
    "it is an open problem how to deal with that region along the axis ( even in the newtonian approach ) , and we shall not address this issue here any further .",
    "however , as we shall see now , these critical regions lie outside the toy galaxy , i.e. , at values @xmath126 , and are localized along the @xmath96-axis . therefore , we are able to draw meaningful conclusions for galactic rotation curves .",
    "contour plots of the velocity are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : patch ] .",
    "the darker the region the higher the velocity .",
    "one unit corresponds to @xmath120 in these plots .",
    "the left figure shows that indeed the function @xmath111 is regular until @xmath127 , while the right figure reveals that on large scales the region we had to cut out stays close to the axis .",
    "the velocity profile in the galactic disk reads @xmath128 various limits are @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "figure [ fig : velo ] depicts the ratio @xmath132 up to @xmath133 .",
    "the velocity profile approximately behaves as required .",
    "remarkably , @xmath113 determines also the transition between the linear and the flat regime of the velocity profile , whereas the choice of @xmath121 determines the transition between the flat and the asymptotic regime .",
    "thus , within this model the thickness of the bulge may be predicted from the velocity profile .",
    "we have calculated the function @xmath40 by solving - and found that it is negligible up to the sub - permil level , besides the integration constant .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that @xmath134 .",
    "thus , for most practical purposes @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is an integration constant .",
    "the density may now be derived from , @xmath137 integrating the density over the white region in the right fig .",
    "[ fig : patch ] yields about @xmath138 solar masses for the total mass , which is not unreasonable .",
    "the density within the galactic disk behaves as follows : for @xmath95 is goes to a constant ( @xmath139 ) , for @xmath140 it falls off like @xmath141 and for @xmath142 it falls off like @xmath143",
    ".      we shall now compare the mass density for a given velocity profile as predicted by simple newtonian considerations with the gr mass density calculated above .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the galactic plane for simplicity .",
    "the newtonian density for a given velocity profile may be derived naively from equating the kinetic energy per mass , @xmath144 , to the potential energy per mass , @xmath145 .",
    "the quantity @xmath146 denotes the spherical radius @xmath147 , which coincides with the axial one in the galactic plane .",
    "differentiation establishes @xmath148 the proportionality constant is known , but irrelevant as we are interested solely in the ratio @xmath149 and @xmath21 contains still an arbitrary multiplicative constant @xmath150 which has to be fixed . in order to get a result which is robust with respect to slight changes in the spectral density @xmath108",
    "we assume an _ arbitrary _ function @xmath108 with the following two properties : 1 .",
    "it leads to an approximately linear velocity profile for small @xmath41 ( `` small '' meaning , small as compared to @xmath120 , but not so small that one is at the scale of the galactic black hole , e.g.  around @xmath151 ) , 2 .",
    "it leads to an approximately flat velocity profile for large @xmath41 ( `` large '' meaning , large as compared to sub-@xmath152 but still smaller than the whole galaxy , e.g.  around @xmath153 ) . for any given velocity profile @xmath99 one may compare the newtonian prediction with the one from gr :",
    "the ratio becomes singular as a consequence of @xmath154 . ]",
    "@xmath155 clearly , at each point in the galaxy we may achieve perfect agreement between newtonian and gr predictions by choosing @xmath150 appropriately .",
    "this reflects the local validity of the newtonian approximation .",
    "however , it is important to realize that globally @xmath150 can only be chosen once .",
    "because usually one requires consistency between newtonian and gr predictions in the region where luminous matter dominates , i.e. , in the linear regime ( @xmath70 ) , let us now fix @xmath150 such that @xmath156 consequently , in the flat regime ( @xmath157 ) we obtain @xmath158 thus , requiring consistency between newton and gr in the linear regime necessarily leads to a considerable deviation in the flat regime : newtonian estimates require @xmath159 of the mass density as compared to gr calculations in order to get the same velocity profile .",
    "we reiterate the key observation : the integration constant @xmath136 emerging in the gr solution can only be fixed once globally .",
    "we stress that these considerations are of relevance only for extended rotating sources .",
    "thus , they play no role for solar system tests because there the main gravitational source is localized in the sun .",
    "using a simple model for a galaxy we could show that the newtonian approximation over - estimates the amount of matter by about a third , whereas gr reduces the amount of dark matter needed to explain the flat rotation curves .",
    "this does not imply that exotic dark matter does not exist as insinuated by @xcite .",
    "after all , dark matter is a `` @xmath160 effect '' ( meaning that there is about five times as much of dark matter in the universe as ordinary matter ) and there are several independent measurements and arguments which suggest the existence of dark matter , e.g.  from microlensing @xcite .",
    "but as astrophysical measurements reach unprecedented accuracy the unexpected gr correction in the @xmath0 range predicted in our paper certainly will not be negligible .",
    "it is emphasized that this prediction has been essentially independent from the particular choice of the spectral density @xmath108 .",
    "it would be interesting to check the robustness of our results by relaxing some of our assumptions  in particular co - rotation  or ( some of ) the symmetry requirements .",
