    "the baseline traffic represents the most prominent traffic patterns @xcite , and is helpful to anomaly detection , capacity planning , and green computing .",
    "most traditional studies focused on baselining the single - link traffic @xcite , however , as the network - wide traffic analysis is becoming increasingly popular , baselining the network - wide traffic turns into a most urgent problem .",
    "the traffic matrix is an important kind of network - wide traffic data and has complex characteristics .",
    "the baseline of a traffic matrix should capture the common patterns among traffic flows , and be stable against the disturbance of large anomalies .",
    "principal component analysis ( pca ) was used for traffic matrix analysis in @xcite , and showed the low - rank nature of the baseline ( i.e. the deterministic ) component , but it performed poorly in the presence of contamination by large anomalies @xcite .",
    "recently , the robust principal component analysis ( rpca ) theory @xcite has attracted wide attentions .",
    "supposing a low - rank matrix is contaminated by a sparse matrix whose non - zeros entries may have large magnitudes , candes et al .",
    "@xcite presented a robust matrix decomposition method named principal component pursuit ( pcp ) , and proved that under surprising board conditions , pcp could recover the low - rank matrix with high probability . following this exact `` low - rank and sparsity '' assumption , bandara et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the robust baseline ( rbl ) method , and argued that rbl performs better than several existing traffic baseline methods .    intuitively , the baseline traffic time - series of each flow should be `` smooth '' enough , i.e. it records the long - term and steady traffic trends ( such as the diurnal pattern ) and neglects the short - term fluctuations .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this problem has not been adequately studied when baselining the traffic matrix .",
    "actually , the resulting baseline traffic time - series for rbl are not smooth enough , and it can be explained that the empirical traffic matrix does not exactly meet the `` low - rank and sparsity '' assumption , on the contrary , it also contains non - smooth noisy fluctuations which should be decomposed specially .",
    "furthermore , the evaluation of traffic baseline methods was not sufficient in previous studies .",
    "a key point is that obtaining the ground - truth baseline of real - world traffic data is usually impossible , consequently , one could neither measure the accuracy of a baseline method , nor compare the performances of different baseline methods . therefore",
    ", baselining network - wide traffic is still a challenging task .    in this letter , we first establish a refinement of the traffic matrix decomposition model in @xcite , which extends the assumption of deterministic traffic matrix to characterize the smoothness of baseline traffic .",
    "secondly , we propose a novel baseline method for the traffic matrix data , which solves a constrained convex program named stable principal component pursuit with time - frequency constraints ( spcp - tfc ) . as an extension of the stable principal component pursuit ( spcp ) method @xcite",
    ", spcp - tfc takes distinctive time - frequency constraints for our refined model .",
    "thirdly , we design the accelerate proximal gradient ( apg ) algorithm for spcp - tfc which has a fast convergence rate . at",
    "last , we evaluate our traffic baseline method by abundant simulations , and show it has a superior performance than rbl and pca .",

    "a traffic flow is the traffic of a original - destination ( od ) pair @xcite , or the traffic traversing a unidirectional backbone link @xcite . in @xcite , we proposed the simple traffic matrix decomposition model ( tmdm ) , assuming @xmath4 is the sum of a low - rank matrix , a sparse matrix , and a noise matrix .",
    "this model is equivalent to the data model of the generalized rpca problem @xcite , and the low - rank deterministic traffic matrix corresponds to the baseline traffic .",
    "however , tmdm gives no temporal characteristics of the baseline traffic .",
    "since each baseline traffic flow records the long - term and steady traffic trends , it should display a smooth curve .",
    "plenty of mathematical tools , such as wavelets and splines , can formulate smoothness .",
    "as the most salient baseline traffic patterns are slow oscillation behaviors , this letter formulates the baseline traffic time - series as the sum of harmonics with low frequencies , and establishes a refined traffic matrix decomposition model ( r - tmdm ) :    * definition 1 * ( r - tmdm ) _ the traffic matrix @xmath0 is the superposition of the deterministic ( baseline ) traffic matrix @xmath5 , the anomaly traffic matrix @xmath6 , and the noise traffic matrix @xmath7 .",
