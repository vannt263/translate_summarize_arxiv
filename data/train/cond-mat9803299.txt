    "the problem of electron correlations is one of the most fascinating and challenging of condensed matter physics .",
    "it is also of great practical importance .",
    "an example is the energy gap of a semiconductor which we certainly would like to be able to calculate without any adjustable parameter .",
    "its size depends crucially on electron correlations .",
    "therefore we can hope to calculate it only if we are able to treat correlations without making uncontrolled approximations .",
    "most people are unaware that this goal has not been reached yet . for a detailed understanding and accurate treatment of correlations it is mandatory to calculate the wavefunction of the ground state and the excited states of the electronic system .",
    "there are other powerful methods used in electronic theory which base their advantages by avoiding just that , like the density functional theory ( dft ) and the local density approximation ( lda ) to it [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the latter has been extremely successful and useful from various points of view .",
    "its conceptional simplicity is particularly noteworthy .",
    "however , by construction it excludes detailed insight into the correlation problem which can be gained , e.g. , by studying the pair - distribution function @xmath1 of the system .",
    "the latter is defined by    @xmath2    here @xmath3 is the ground - state wavefunction of the system , @xmath4 are the coordinates of the electrons and @xmath5 is their density at point @xmath6 .",
    "this function yields the probability of finding an electron at point @xmath7 provided there is one at point @xmath6 , @xmath8 to the one without that constraint .",
    "it is therefore suitable for describing electrons which avoid each other in order to reduce their mutual coulomb repulsion .",
    "this gives rise to a correlation hole which is associated with each electron .",
    "an accurate description of this correlation hole , in particular at small distances is the heart of the correlation problem .",
    "it is for that reason that the pair - distribution function is intimately connected with the exchange - correlation energy @xmath9 $ ] in density - functional theory .",
    "the relationship is    @xmath10=\\frac{e^2}{2}\\int~d^3r d^3r'\\rho(\\underline{r})~\\frac{\\tilde{g}(\\underline{r},\\underline{r}')-1}{|\\underline{r}-\\underline{r}'|}~\\rho(\\underline{r}')\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is related to @xmath12 via    @xmath13    the parameter @xmath14 multiplies the interaction constant @xmath15 of the electrons , which enters @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath16 [ 5,6 ] when @xmath12 is calculated .",
    "the simplicity of the lda or comparable approximations to density functional theory results from making a reasonable @xmath17 for @xmath12 instead of trying to calculate it from first principles .    given",
    "that one aims at calculating the many - electron wavefunction of a periodic solid one is faced with a number of quantum - chemical methods which are designed to do just that for small molecules . particularly well known are the configuration - interaction ( ci ) method [ 7 ] , the coupled electron pair approximation ( cepa ) [ 8 - 10 ] , and the coupled cluster ( cc ) method [ 8,9,11,12 ] .",
    "these methods have in common that they start out from a self - consistent field ( scf ) hamiltonian @xmath18 and its ground - state wavefunction .",
    "correlations are included by admixing @xmath19 excited states to the ground state . for solids",
    "it is important to use methods which are size consistent , i.e. , which yield a correlation energy proportional to the system size when the systems are large .",
    "this excludes the ci method which lacks that property .",
    "it is a variational method and therefore has the advantage of giving upper bounds to the energy .",
    "the size - consistency problem can be eliminated by expressing the energy in terms of cumulants [ 13,14 ] .",
    "this ensures that all approximations remain size consistent",
    ".    a scf calculation will be a good starting point for a correlation calculation only when the correlations are not too strong .",
    "this will generally be the case for solids which involve @xmath20 and @xmath21 electrons only .",
    "when @xmath0 electrons come into play , or in many cases also @xmath22 electrons , then the electron correlations are usually so strong that a scf wavefunction is not a good starting point for a computation of the exact wavefunction . in a molecular calculation",
    "the problem may be circumvented by starting instead from a multiconfiguration self - consistent field calculation ( mc - scf ) . by a proper choice of the active space ( or of the different slater determinants which are used )",
    "one can include the most important correlations already at that level and treat the remaining weaker ones by a subsequent ci or cepa calculation . for a solid",
    "this is not possible because several configurations @xmath23 would be required , i.e. , their number would become infinitely large .",
    "possibly , ways can be found in the future to solve this problem .",
    "at present , however , we depend on treating strongly correlated electrons by simplified model hamiltonians . therefore we will subdivide here the discussion of correlations into one of weakly and one of strongly correlated systems .    as regards weakly correlated systems another topic requires attention . when applying methods like ci or cepa in molecular calculations , the excited states which are admixed with the scf ground - state wavefunction are usually the scf ones , which extend generally over the whole molecule . going over to an infinite solid",
    "this would imply the admixture of infinitely many excitations ( configurations ) to the ground - state wavefunction @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is evident that the correlation hole of an electron is a rather local object , which is confined to the immediate surroundings of it .",
    "therefore , it should be described by @xmath25 operators acting on @xmath24 or @xmath25 excitations .",
    "this was first consequently done in ref .",
    "the same ideas were later applied in slightly modified versions , e.g. , in refs . [ 16,17 ] . working with local operators",
    "is also useful in order to limit efficiently the number of configurations one is admixing to @xmath24 .",
    "this brings us to the concept of partitioning and projection which has been stressed by lwdin [ 18 ] . instead of constructing the @xmath26 ground state @xmath27 from @xmath24 by applying operators chosen from the full operator- or liouville space @xmath28",
    "one limits their choice to a relevant subspace @xmath29 .",
    "the latter must contain , e.g. , all those local operators which are necessary in order to describe the correlation hole of the electrons with a required degree of accuracy .",
    "thus , instead of expanding the ground - state energy in powers of the residual interactions @xmath30 one partitions @xmath28 into a relevant part @xmath29 and an irrelevant one @xmath31 and projects the wave operators @xmath32 defined by    @xmath33    onto @xmath29 . within that restricted space the ground - state wavefunction and energy are found by diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the concept of projection and partitioning can also be applied to the computation of green s functions [ 19 ] .",
    "this is very useful when we calculate the spectral density of a strongly correlated electron system described by a model hamiltonian .",
    "the ones of @xmath34 metal and of @xmath35 planes , the most important structural element of the high @xmath36 superconducting cuprates serve as examples here .",
    "a particularly interesting phenomenon is that of electron or hole crystallization .",
    "the conditions for its occurrance were first determined by wigner [ 20 ] , who considered a homogeneous electron gas .",
    "a prerequisite for electron crystallization is that the electronic coulomb repulsion dominates the kinetic energy , a condition fulfilled for a homogeneous electron gas only when the density is very low . in intermetallic rare - earth compounds the @xmath37 electrons have a small kinetic energy even at large densities because of the small spatial extent of the @xmath37 orbitals .",
    "therefore , electron or hole crystallization is expected to occur in favourable cases even at high densities .",
    "there is clear evidence that @xmath38 is an example of @xmath37 hole crystallization at low temperatures [ 21,22 ] .",
    "one much investigated feature of strongly correlated electron systems is a high density of low - lying excitations .",
    "they involve predominantly spin degrees of freedom and lead to heavy - fermion behaviour ( for reviews see [ 23 - 27 ] ) .",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between the low - energy excitations of a heavy fermion system and those of a nearly free electron system , provided one renormalizes the effective mass of the latter",
    ". the characteristic low - energy scale of a heavy - fermion system can be of different physical origin like the kondo effect [ 28 ] , the zeeman effect [ 29 ] or quasi one - dimensional spin chains [ 30 ] . the materials @xmath39 [ 31 ] , @xmath40 [ 32 ] and @xmath41 [ 33 ] are examples for these three different physical cases .",
    "we start out describing the formalism used for the calculation of the ground state and some of its properties of a weakly correlated electron system .",
    "this is followed up by a presentation of the results for a number of semiconductors and ionic crystals .      in order to ensure size consistency in the sense described above we express all size - extensive quantities in terms of cumulants [ 13,14 ] .",
    "we divide the hamiltonian @xmath42 into two parts    @xmath43    and assume that the ground state @xmath44 of @xmath45 is known while @xmath46 must be treated approximately . in the case of weakly - correlated electron systems we shall identify @xmath45 with the self - consistent field hamiltonian @xmath18 and @xmath46 with the residual interactions , but we prefer keeping the discussion of the projection technique more general .",
    "we write for the ground - state energy    @xmath47    where    @xmath48    here the superoperator or liouvillean @xmath49 refers to @xmath45 , i.e. , it acts on operators @xmath50 according to    @xmath51_-.\\ ] ]    the brackets in eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) are defined as follows    @xmath52    the upper script @xmath53 indicates that the cumulant of that expectation value must be taken .",
    "the cumulant of a product of operators is defined by    @xmath54    for two operators this expression reduces to    @xmath55    using cumulants requires care [ 34 ] .",
    "for example , we must distinguish between the number 1 and the unit operator @xmath56 .",
    "the difference is    @xmath57    > from the properties of cumulants it follows that for any operator @xmath50 ( but not for @xmath53 numbers ) the following relation holds    @xmath58    the projection or partitioning method approximates @xmath59 by admitting for its construction only operators from a reduced @xmath60 subspace @xmath29 of the full operator space @xmath28 .",
    "the operator @xmath61 is thus projected onto @xmath29 .",
    "the quality of the approximation can be improved by successively increasing the dimension of @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath29 be of dimension @xmath62 and spanned by a set of operators @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "we may choose the @xmath65 to be orthonormal , i.e. ,    @xmath66    the wave operator is then given by    @xmath67    in case that all @xmath68 couple directly to @xmath46 , i.e. , when    @xmath69    one may use eq .",

    "it poses no problem to establish also a link between eqs .",
    "( 2.2 , 2.9 ) and the coupled - cluster method which was originally developed in nuclear physics [ 12 ] but has been successfully applied also to quantum chemistry [ 8,11 ] . as has been shown in refs .",

    ".      we can perform correlation calculations of high accuracy for the ground state of semiconductors or insulators applying the method of increments [ 36 - 40 ] .",
    "let us first consider the elemental semiconductors or the iii - v and ii - vi compounds which all have well defined bonds .",
    "we express @xmath80 in terms of ( localized ) wannier orbitals rather than ( delocalized ) bloch states .",
    "the wannier orbitals define the different bonds i. the relevant operators are identified with the operators @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the @xmath104 describe one - and two - particle excitations out of bond i where @xmath106 is a tcounting index .",
    "similarly , the @xmath105 describe those two - particle excitations , where the initial state of one excitation is the wannier orbital i while that of the other one is the wannier orbital @xmath107",
    ". therefore    @xmath108    where the @xmath109 and @xmath110 are determined according to eq .",
    "the method of increments provides a way of solving approximately that system of equations .",
    "it is based on the following idea .",
    "first , all electrons are kept frozen except those in bond i. after the corresponding correlation energy @xmath111 has been determined from eq.(2.16 ) , one repeats the calculations by releasing electrons in bonds i and j. this yields a new correlation energy @xmath112 or an increment    @xmath113    as compared with the previous case .",
    "thereafter , electrons in bonds @xmath114 are released with the remaining ones kept frozen and so on .",
    "after each step a new correlation energy @xmath115 etc . is obtained with corresponding increments    @xmath116    and so on .",
    "the total correlation energy @xmath90 is then written in terms of the energy increments as    @xmath117    where @xmath118 denotes pairs and triples of bonds , respectively .",
    "the advantage of this expansion is that the series is usually rapidly convergent [ 36 ] even when @xmath79 is not small .",
    "it has been demonstrated that there are strong relations between the method of increments and faddeev s equations , provided the latter are properly generalized to a hierarchy of cumulant equations [ 34 ] .",
    "these relations enable us to state the size of the error when the series ( 2.24 ) is terminated at some point .",
    "when ionic crystals are considered the increments refer to different ions instead of bonds . for example , the first increment to be calculated for @xmath119 is the correlation energy attributed to an @xmath120 ion surrounded by @xmath121 and @xmath120 ions .",
    "an accurate modelling of the surroundings is essential , since an isolated @xmath120 is not stable .",
    "similarly , the correlation - energy increment @xmath122 has to be determined .",
    "the two - body increments involve pairs of @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ions and so on .",
    "an important point is the following .",
    "the matrix element @xmath126 and @xmath127 which are needed to determine the correlation energy ( see eq .",
    "( 2.18 ) ) can be computed from clusters .",
    "when the cluster is chosen so large that a matrix element does not change any more , we are sure that its value is that for the solid .",
    "this enables us to apply quantum chemical program packages like molpro [ 41 ] to determine them and hence the different correlation contributions .",
    "starting point for the computation of the ground - state wavefunction and energy is a @xmath19 calculation .",
    "obtaining accurate @xmath19 energies for solids is still a difficult computational task .",
    "pisani and co - workers have developed the successful program package crystal [ 42 ] which allows for @xmath128 ( linear combination of atomic orbital ) calculations on periodic solids .",
    "it expands the bloch orbitals in terms of gaussian - type orbitals ( gto s ) and obtains the canonical scf solutions .",
    "the latter can always be transformed to a localized representation by using a suitable localization procedure [ 43 ] .",
    "however , convergency problems are encountered when gaussian functions with small exponents are used .",
    "an alternative ab - initio embedded - cluster approach has been developed within the framework of the lcao method in which the localization procedure is part of the process leading to the scf solutions [ 44 ] .",
    "thereby the solid is modelled as a central cluster embedded in the field created by the remaining part of the infinite solid .",
    "test calculations for @xmath129 agree with those obtained from the crystal program , but large scale applications have not been performed yet .",
    "a third possibility for obtaining the scf ground - state wavefunction of a solid is by means of cluster calculations .",
    "a fragment of the lattice is used with dangling bonds saturated by hydrogen atoms .",
    "an example is @xmath130 .",
    "the calculated localized orbital for the central bond of the cluster can be used to very good approximation for every bond of the solid .    after the scf ground - state wavefunction has been determined the correlation corrections",
    "are incorporated either on a @xmath92 ( see eqs .",
    "( 2.17 - 18 ) ) or @xmath103 ( see eqs .",
    "( 2.19 - 20 ) ) level , thereby applying the method of increments .",
    "we discuss first the results for the elemental semiconductors and the cubic iii - v compounds before we turn our attention to the ionic crystals .",
    "+    the @xmath19 calculations for the valence electrons are done with a basis set consisting of @xmath131 .",
    "its size is @xmath132 $ ] in standard notation , i.e. , four @xmath20-like gto s are contracted into three orbitals and similarly for @xmath21-like functions .",
    "the inner shells are described by a quasirelativistic pseudopotential [ 45 ] . in some cases a polarization potential",
    "is added in order to account for the polarization of the inner shells by the valence electrons . for further details concerning the basis set we refer to the original literature [ 46 ] . the cohesive energy obtained within",
    "the scf approximation is only between 55 - 72 % for the elemental semiconductors and between 55 - 67 % for the cubic iii - v compounds ( see tables 1,2 ) .",
    "thus , even for these weakly correlated systems the correlation contribution to binding is appreciable .",
    "lattice constants come out much better in scf approximation , the errors being less than 2% ( see fig .",
    "bulk modulili are generally overestimated by up to 20 % ( see , e.g. , table 4 ) . for a treatment of correlations",
    "the basis sets have to be enlarged .",
    "instead of using one set of @xmath22 functions only , we use two sets of @xmath22 functions and one set of @xmath0 functions .",
    "the basis is therefore of size @xmath133 $ ] which is very respectable for diamond and silicon , but less for heavy elements like @xmath134 or @xmath135 because of low lying @xmath22 states .",
    "results for the cohesive energy of the group iv semiconducting and the cubic iii - v compounds are listed in tables 1 and 2 , respectively . one",
    "notices that about 90 % of the binding energy are obtained in all cases .",
    "the missing percentage is due to basis set limitations . by including a second set of @xmath0 functions and one set of @xmath136 functions one would further improve the accuracy of the calculated values , in particular for the systems involving heavy atoms .",
    "it is well known that bond lengths or alternatively lattice constants are relatively well reproduced by a scf calculation .",
    "the same holds true for the group iv semiconductors as is seen from table 3 .",
    "the inclusion of a core polarization potential is important in order to come much closer to the experimental values .",
    "when correlations among valence electrons are included in the way described above the error for the lattice constant is less than 0.7 % in all cases .",
    "the bulk modulus @xmath137 is defined by    @xmath138    where @xmath139 is the ground - state energy as function of the lattice parameter @xmath140 . as mentioned before ,",
    "self - consistent field calculations overestimate generally @xmath137 .",
    "the core - polarization potential as well as the correlation energy lead to a decrease of @xmath137 so that the final results are close to the experimental ones ( see table 4 ) .",
    "this is easy to understand : when correlations are taken into account they keep electrons apart .",
    "therefore an increase in pressure results in a smaller energy increase than obtained by a scf treatment , where electrons come too close to each other at the expense of coulomb repulsion energy .",
    "we are particularly interested in trends concerning the @xmath141atomic correlation energy .",
    "the latter is obtained when a minimal basis set is used , i.e. , one containing one set of @xmath20 and @xmath21 functions only .",
    "correlations , which require for their description a larger than minimal basis set are termed @xmath142-atomic [ 14 ] .",
    "interatomic correlations reduce charge fluctuations between neighboring atoms .",
    "the simplest way of obtaining a good estimate of the one - bond and two - bond contributions is by making a bond - orbital approximation ( boa ) . in this approximation",
    "the ground state is written as a product of independent bonds containing two electrons each . in that case",
    "the interatomic correlation energy depends on the following quantities : the interaction matrix element @xmath143 describing the difference of the coulomb repulsion when two electrons are situated on the same atom and when they are placed on different atoms of the same bond ; the electronic hopping matrix element @xmath144 between atoms of the same bond ; the van der waals interaction , in simplest approximation between neighboring bonds , @xmath145 ; the bond polarity @xmath146 in case of heteropolar bonds [ 52 ] .    for the elemental semiconductors the bare hopping matrix element @xmath144 scales with the tight - binding band width of the system . for diamond",
    "the value is @xmath147 as obtained from band - structure calculations .",
    "we can determine the one for @xmath148 , @xmath134 and @xmath149 according to froyen and harrison [ 53 ] from the width of the lcao bands .",
    "once @xmath144 is known the parameter @xmath143 and @xmath145 follow from the one - bond and two - bonds increments    @xmath150    ( i and j label nearest - neighbor bonds ) when the latter are computed with a minimal basis set .",
    "a list of the calculated parameters is given in table 5 .",
    "one can use them in order to derive a simple scaling relation between the size of @xmath151 and the bond length @xmath22 .",
    "one finds that the following relations describe the data fairly well [ 54 ]    @xmath152    where the script @xmath153 refers to diamond .",
    "going over to the polar iii - iv compounds one expects a relationship    @xmath154    between the interatomic correlation energy in the presence of the polarity @xmath155 and the one calculated from @xmath151 without taking the polarity into account , i.e. , @xmath156 .",
    "in fact , the boa predicts that @xmath157 .",
    "but , when one calculates @xmath156 from eqs . ( 2.28 ) using the experimental values of @xmath22 and compares it with the @xmath158 results using minimal basis sets one finds a value of @xmath159 .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is the following . in the boa",
    "the excited electrons remain in their original bonds while in the ab inito approach excitations into other bonds are taken into account too .",
    "a simple estimate of the @xmath142atomic correlation energy is more difficult .",
    "using the values of the free atoms is a too rough method .",
    "one way is to apply an @xmath160 approach [ 55 ] originally suggested by moffitt .",
    "it takes into account that the ratio of @xmath20 and @xmath21 electrons differs from that of a free atom when a solid is formed .",
    "also , the electron number fluctuates when the atom is part of the solid and this is also accounted for in that approach . for more details",

    "are shortened while those in the other three directions parallel to the diagonals of a cube are elongated .",
    "the driving mechanism of the phase transition is the coulomb repulsion of holes .",
    "the energy is minimized when the holes move into one family of chains because of the large distances between ions in a chain . disregarding first the structural changes associated with the phase transition we are faced with a hamiltonian for the holes of the form    @xmath337    the operators @xmath338 , @xmath339 are the same as in eq .",

    "the last term is due to the exchange and @xmath188 refers of pairs of ions in the same chain . while exchange plays a minor role in a wigner crystal due to the large lattice constant it is of importance when crystallization takes place at high densities as it is the case here .",
    "considering only the coulomb term without taking screening into account except by using an effective charge , it has been demonstrated that the energy difference between a uniform distribution of holes and one with the holes concentrated in one family of chains is of the order of a few @xmath343 per formula unit [ 102 ] .",
    "a comparison with the effective @xmath0 bandwidth of order 0.2 ev makes plausible that hole crystallization will take place .",

    "this leads back to a state with short and long chains and therefore with holes concentrating in the short chains [ 30 ] .",
    "however , that order will not be a perfect one for the reason that the @xmath345-fold degenerate state has a slightly lower repulsion energy .",

    "the slow , antiferromagnetic fluctuations of the @xmath217 spins are replaced by a static staggered field acting on them .",

    "the following experimental observations are relevant in that respect",
    ". measurements of the hall constant demonstrate that at low temperatures only one carrier per @xmath532 ions remains .",
    "we interprete this being due to the @xmath335 chains representing almost half - filled hubbard systems .",
    "the resistivity is at low temperatures of the form @xmath533 like for a fermi liquid .",
    "a linear specific heat is found at low @xmath359 with a @xmath381 coefficient of order @xmath534 .",
    "the spin susceptibility is pauli like and similarly enhanced as @xmath381 , giving rise to a sommerfeld - wilson ratio of order unity .",
    "no indication of magnetic order is found down to @xmath535 , but below @xmath536 the susceptibility starts to increase again indicating the presence of another low energy scale [ 126 ] .",
    "these findings strongly suggest heavy - fermion behavior which is further confirmed by the observation that the ratio @xmath537 with @xmath538 is similar to that of other heavy - fermion systems .",
    "we reemphasize that the @xmath381 coefficient exceeds the one , e.g. , of @xmath539 metal by a factor of more than @xmath540 despite a carrier concentration of only 1 per @xmath532 ions .",
    "this shows clearly that the low - energy scale must involve spin degrees of freedom of the @xmath335 ions .",
    "indeed , chains of antiferromagnetically coupled spins have a linear specific heat @xmath358 .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments by kohgi and coworkers [ 22 ] have demonstrated that the magnetic excitation spectrum is that of a heisenberg chain with a coupling constant @xmath541 .",
    "this spectrum leads to a @xmath381 value of the observed size .",
    "the physical origin of the heavy - fermion excitations is therefore very different here than that in the kondo - lattice case .",
    "a theory has been developed which explains consistently the above experimental findings [ 30 ] .",
    "it is based on interpreting the structural phase transition in terms of a band jahn - teller ( cbjt ) effect .",
    "this interpretation is suggested by the physical considerations outlined in sec .",
    "iv in connection with the hole crystallization taking place . in the theory applied here",
    "the crystallization is due to a strong deformation - potential coupling which is quite common in mixed - valence systems .",
    "this potential has its origin in the coulomb repulsion of the @xmath37 holes .",
    "the @xmath542 transition splits the fourfold degenerate quasi-1@xmath22 density of states into a nondegenerate one corresponding to the short chains and a threefold one due to the long chains .",
    "the nondegenerate one is lower in energy and would be half filled if charge ordering were perfect and the holes were uncorrelated fermions . instead",
    ", the holes are strongly correlated .",
    "two holes on a site imply a @xmath543 configuration for @xmath331 and that has a much too high energy to occur .",
    "therefore , we are dealing with an almost full lower ( hole ) hubbard band rather than with an almost half - filled conduction band .",
    "therefore , the system should be close to an insulator . that @xmath38 is a semimetal and",
    "not an insulator is most probably related to the nonvanishing hopping matrix elements between @xmath37 orbitals in the long and short chains .",
    "we have discussed in sec .",
    "iv that the zero - point fluctuations of the @xmath37 holes lead to a partial ( though small ) transfer of holes to the long chains .",
    "we speak of self - doping if this transfer causes the gap in the excitation spectrum of ( quasi ) one - dimensional hubbard chains to vanish .",
    "accurate conditions for self - doping are not easily worked out , but a first step in this direction was done recently [ 127 ] .      with increasing charge ordering , correlations become more and more important because with the increase in concentration of holes in the short chains their average distance decreases .",
    "therefore , at low temperatures @xmath359 the @xmath193 hamiltonian ( see eq . ( 3.2 ) ) or a hubbard hamiltonian ( 3.1 ) must be used .",
    "using the former and making use of a slave - boson mean - field approximation we arrive at an effective mass enhancement of the form      here @xmath545 denotes the band mass , @xmath546 is the deviation of the short chains denoted by 1 from half filling and @xmath200 , where @xmath186 is the on - site coulomb repulsion between holes . with @xmath547 one",
    "finds @xmath548 ev and using @xmath549 with @xmath550 one obtains a ratio of @xmath551 .",
    "the derivation of the mass enhancement hides somewhat the fact that spin degrees of freedom are responsible for the heavy quasiparticles .",
    "they become better visible when one sets @xmath552 , which is the case of no charge carriers .",
    "even then one finds fermionic excitations with a large effective mass and corresponding heat coefficient @xmath381 .",
    "the theory was recently improved [ 103 ] by including in the hamiltonian ( 5.21 ) an on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath186 between @xmath37 holes .",
    "this one - dimensional jahn - teller model can be solved exactly by a lieb - wu bethe type ansatz .",
    "of particular interest is that a self - doped distorted phase is obtained in a sizable regime of parameters . since spin - wave - like excitations are responsible for the fermionic low - energy excitations associated with the specific heat and susceptibility at low @xmath359 we are dealing here with charge - neutral heavy fermions in distinction to the charged heavy electrons , which appear , e.g. , in @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we speak of an uncharged or neutral heavy fermi liquid .",
    "the physical interpretation given above allows for an explanation of another experiment .",
    "it has been previously found that an applied magnetic field of @xmath553 tesla has little influence on the @xmath381 coefficient above 2 k , but suppresses @xmath381 considerably below 2 k [ 128 ] .",
    "this effect is unexpected , since one would have thought that the changes are of order @xmath554 and therefore very small .",
    "however , we can explain the experiments by providing for a weak coupling between parallel short chains .",
    "when linear spin - wave theory is applied , a ratio of order @xmath555 between interchain and intrachain coupling opens an anisotropy gap which modifies @xmath509 in accordance with observation [ 129 ] .",
