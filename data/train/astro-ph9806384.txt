    "the asteroid 1689 floris - jan is a small sized object from the main asteroid belt .",
    "it was discovered on september 1930 by h. van gent .",
    "the diameter of 1689 floris - jan is estimated to be 9 to 27 km depending on the assumed albedo . in 1982",
    "schober et .",
    "al . ( 1982 ) presented ubv photometry of this object , which revealed its unusually long period of rotation of 6.042 @xmath0 0.21 days .",
    "typical periods of rotation of asteroids range from about 2 to about 20 hours . for many years",
    "this asteroid was considered to be one of the slowest rotators among minor planets .",
    "1689 floris - jan was selected as a target for the observations by our colleagues from the astronomical observatory of adam mickiewicz university , pozna , during a long term program of ccd photometry of minor planets ( kryszczyska et .",
    "al . , 1996 ) .",
    "observational data were collected at the ostrowik station of the warsaw university observatory . we used a ccd system attached to 0.6 m telescope ( udalski and pych , 1992 ) . on nights of february 10th , 1997 and february 11th , 1997 we used cousins i filter for 120 second exposures . on the night of march 7th , 1997",
    "we made unfiltered exposures with integration time of 60 seconds .",
    "de - biasing and flat - fielding were done with the procedures available in the iraf package .",
    "aperture photometry was obtained with the daophotii program ( stetson , 1987 ) .",
    "figure 1 presents the light curve of the 1689 floris - jan compared with the light curves of two nearby stars , obtained on the night 1997.02.11/12 .",
    "monotonic rise of brightness is observed .",
    "this is the manifestation of the long rotational period of the planet .",
    "short period light variations with an amplitude of about 0.1 mag . are superimposed onto the long term trend .",
    "we subtracted linear trends from the data from feb.10th , 1997 and feb .",
    "11th , 1997 separately .",
    "figure 2 shows the aov ( schwarzenberg - czerny , 1991 ) and fourier - clean ( roberts et.al . , 1987 )",
    "periodograms computed on the collected data points .",
    "peaks corresponding to the period of 0.003461 @xmath0 0.000006 [ days ] ( 4.98 @xmath0 0.01 minutes ) are clearly present on both periodograms .    figure 3 presents phased light curve based on the points from the two nights .",
    "solid line shows sine fit to the obtained light curve .",
    "full amplitude of the fit is 0.084 mag .",
    "taking into account that exposure time was 40% of the observed period we made the amplitude correction according to the following formula : @xmath1 this correction yields the real amplitude of about 0.11 mag .    the observed period might be two times longer ( i.e. about 10 minutes ) , if we assume that it was a result of the fast rotation of the object . lately",
    "two independent groups claimed similar periodicity in the light variations of an apollo - type object 1998 ky26 ( pravec and sarounova , 1998 ; hicks and rabinowitz , 1998 ) .",
    "no light oscillations of the 5 minute period were observed in the data obtained for 1689 floris - jan in the night of match 7th , 1997 .",
    "figure 4 presents the light curve of 1689 floris - jan compared with the light curves of the two nearby stars .",
    "no significant light variations are present .",
