    "dark energy is the mysterious entity that accounts for @xmath0 of the mass - energy content of the universe and is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate .",
    "the current cosmological observations [ 1 - 3 ] and theories suggest that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion due to dark energy .",
    "possible candidates for this dark energy are a cosmological constant , a slowly rolling scalar field , chaplygin gas , tachyonic field etc .",
    "the cosmological constant scenario with a spatially flat or a nearly spatially flat universe implies an energy density of order @xmath1 today . in this model , this energy density should be constant in time , giving rise to severe problems ( see ref.[4 ] ) , making the explanation of dark energy with a cosmological constant which is unnatural .",
    "a more general model is that of a slowly rolling scalar field , known as quintessence , which has a negative pressure and therefore accelerates expansion .",
    "+ researchers at fermilab in the us have carried out the first laboratory experiment to look for a hypothetical form of matter known as chameleon particles .",
    "chameleon particles were first proposed in 2003 by justin khoury and amanda weltman [ 5 ] at columbia university as a possible explanation for dark energy . in places where the density of matter is relatively high",
    ", chameleon particles interact very weakly with other matter and only over very short distances , which could explain why we have yet to spot them here on earth . in the inter - galactic space where matter density is extremely low ,",
    "the particles interact much more strongly with other matter and over very large distances",
    ". the particles could be spotted by how they affect light travelling to earth from distant galaxies which are considered details in ref .",
    "[ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "+ if chameleon particles could be created within a steel - walled vacuum chamber of few centimeters in diameter and several meters long(which is called gammav chamber ) , many of them would be unable to escape , that is because the mass of a chameleon is proportional to the local density .",
    "chameleons be created by firing a laser into a region of the chamber containing a very high magnetic field .",
    "if the chameleon field couples strongly to matter , we would have already detected it as a fifth force in gravitational experiments .",
    "a candidate one could come up with for such a scalar field could be the dilation from string theory .",
    "there exists a mechanism which suppresses the coupling of the field to matter , avoiding detection .",
    "recently , a new model was suggested [ 5 ] such that : in which a scalar field with a thin - shell mechanism couples to matter with gravitational strength while remaining very light on cosmological scales .",
    "the crucial feature of this field is that the coupling gives it a mass depending on the local density of matter .",
    "thus the scalar field is named chameleon .",
    "several works has been done due to chameleon field [ 9 - 13 ] . in regions of high matter density",
    ", chameleon field has a large mass and therefore its interaction with matter is small . in regions of low energy density , like the solar system , the mass is small and the interaction should be large and observable .",
    "the action of this field is suppressed by a so called thin - shell mechanism , to be discussed later . in opposition to slow rolling scalar field models , chameleons are not limited to quintessence . + the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we have considered a flat frw model which represents the corresponding equation of chameleon field where the scale function is taken as , ( i ) intermediate expansion and ( ii ) logamediate expansion . in both the cases we find the expressions of the chameleon field , chameleon potential and slow - roll parameters .",
    "we have taken some particular values of the parameters and constants for the graphical representation .",
    "the paper ends with a short discussion in section iii .",

    "the cold dark matter and chameleon field interact with each other .",
    "the variation of action of the above equation w.r.t @xmath6 gives , @xmath12 which reduces to , @xmath13    which is the wave equation for the chameleon field .",
    "again , the variation of the same equation w.r.t .",
    "metric tensor components gives ( choosing @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 which are the corresponding field equations . for simplifying the above model",

    "equations ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) together gives , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the integrating constant .",
    "if @xmath27 , then from ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) we get , @xmath28 this is the case where a particular matter dominated the universe and then the fluid is taken in the form of pressureless dust which is considered in ref [ 12 ] .",
