    "it is well known that the standard model ( sm ) includes three generations of fermions , but it does not prohibit the fourth generation . the restrictions on the number of fermion generations come from the qcd asymptotic freedom which constraint them to nine . therefore , shortly after the measurement of the third generation , a fourth generation was an obvious extension .",
    "interest in the fourth generation standard model ( sm4 ) was fairly high in the 1980s until the electroweak precision data seemed to rule it out .",
    "the other reason which shook the interest in the fourth generation was the measurement of the number of light neutrinos at the @xmath16 pole that showed only three light neutrinos could exist .",
    "however , the discovery of neutrino oscillations suggested the possibility of a mass scale beyond the sm , and the models with the sufficiently massive neutrino became acceptable @xcite . though the early study of the ew precision measurements ruled out a fourth generation @xcite , however it was subsequently pointed out @xcite that if the fourth generation masses are not degenerate , then the ew precision data do not prohibit the fourth generation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sm can be simply extended with a sequential repetition as four quark and four lepton left handed doublets and corresponding right handed singlets .",
    "the possible sequential fourth generation may play an important role in understanding the well known problem of cp violation and flavor structure of standard theory @xcite , electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , hierarchies of fermion mass and mixing angle in quark / lepton sectors @xcite .",
    "a thorough discussion on the theoretical and experimental aspects of the fourth generation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the experimental side ,",
    "recent searches by the cdf collaboration for direct production of fourth generation up - type quark @xmath17 and down - type quark @xmath18 found @xmath19 gev @xcite and @xmath20 gev @xcite , assuming @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "this indeed suggest that the fourth generation fermion must be heavy which supports the scenario of compositeness .",
    "the underlying assumption to perform these searches is that @xmath23 and negligible mixing of the @xmath24 states with the two lightest quark generations . to account for ew precision data",
    "such conditions are generally required for the sm4 with the one higgs doublet @xcite . moreover , when a fourth generation of fermions is embedded in theories beyond the sm , the large splitting case @xmath25 and the inverted scenario @xmath26 have not been excluded .",
    "recently , it has also been shown @xcite that the precision ew data can accommodate @xmath25 if there are two higgs doublets .",
    "thus there is no uniquely interesting set of assumptions under which experimental data must be interpreted @xcite and the determination of allowed parameter space of fourth generation fermions will be an important goal of the lhc era .",
    "the large values of the masses of fourth generation would provide special advantage to new interactions originating at a higher scale and the precise determination of the fourth generation quark properties may present the existence of physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is necessary to mention here that these new particles are heavy in nature , consequently they are hard to produce in the accelerators .",
    "therefore , we have to go for some alternate scenarios where we can find their influence . in this regard ,",
    "the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions provide an ideal plateform to establish new physics ( np ) .",
    "this is because of the fact that fcnc transitions are not allowed at tree level in the sm and are allowed at loop level through gim mechanism which can get contributions of np from newly proposed particles via loop diagrams . among different fcnc transitions the one @xmath27 transition plays a pivotal role to perform efficient tests of np scenarios @xcite .",
    "it is also the fact that @xmath7 violation in @xmath28 transitions is predicted to be very small in the sm , thus , any experimental evidence for sizable @xmath7 violating effects in the @xmath29 system would clearly point towards a np scenario . however , among the other np scenarios such as the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) and randall - sundrum ( rs ) models , the study of fcnc transitions in sm4 contain much fewer parameters and has the possibility of having simultaneously sizable np effects in the @xmath30 and @xmath29 systems compared to the above mentioned np models . in this context the constraint on the mixing between the fourth and third generation by using fcnc processes have been studied @xcite along with the effects of the sequential fourth generation on different physical observables in @xmath31 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 decays , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an incomplete list .",
    "the study of the @xmath29 system will be even more complete if one consider the similar decays of the charmed @xmath29 mesons @xmath33 . as @xmath34 is a bound state of two heavy quarks @xmath35 and @xmath36 ,",
    "therefore it is rich in phenomenology compared to other @xmath29 mesons . in literature , some of the possible radiative and semileptonic exclusive decays of @xmath34 mesons like @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 have been studied using the frame work of relativistic constituent quark model 49 , qcd sum rules and light cone sum rules @xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus on the semileptonic @xmath40 decays in sm4 .",
    "the special feature of the semileptonic @xmath41 decays compared to the other @xmath29 meson decays such as @xmath42 is that this decay can occur in two distinct ways i.e. through fcnc transitions and through weak annihilations ( wa ) . in the ordinary charged @xmath29",
    "meson decays the wa contributions are very small and can be safely ignored .",
    "however , for @xmath43 meson these wa contributions are proportional to the ckm matrix elements @xmath44 and hence can not be ignored . _ the decay under discussion here has already been studied in the universal extra dimension ( ued ) model @xcite where it has been seen that the wa contribution suppress the np effects coming through ued model in different physical observables .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see how sm4 effects in different physical observables will behave in the presence of these wa contributions_.    while working on the exclusive @xmath29-meson decays the main job is to calculate the form factors which are the non perturbative quantities and are the scalar functions of the square of momentum transfer @xmath45 . in literature the form factors for @xmath46 (",
    "@xmath47 decays were calculated using different approaches , such as light front constituent quark models , a relativistic quark model , qcd sum rules and through ward identities @xcite . in this work",
    "we will use qcd sum rules form factors @xcite to study the fourth generation effects on different physical observables such as branching ratio , forward - backward asymmetry , polarization asymmetries of leptons and the helicity fractions of final state meson @xmath48 for these decays . as the expected number of events for the production of @xmath34 meson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are about @xmath49 per year @xcite therefore",
    ", we hope that the phenomenological study of the @xmath34 meson could provide us a valuable tool for distinguishing the sm4 effects from the sm and other np scenarios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the two different contributions to the amplitude of @xmath50 decays which were named as wa and penguin contributions . these can be parameterized in terms of the form factors , where the values of the form factors appearing in the calculation of wa amplitude will be used from 53a and for the penguin contributions will be taken from @xcite .",
    "section iii presents the basic formulas for physical observables like decay rate , lepton forward - backward asymmetry , helicity fractions of @xmath51 meson and the polarization asymmetries of the final state lepton .",
    "the numerical study of these observables will be given in section v and the section vi gives the summary of the main outcomes of this study .",
    "the charmed @xmath29-meson @xmath33 is made up of two different heavy flavors , @xmath35-quark and @xmath36-quark , which brings wa contributions into the play .",
    "following the procedure given in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath52 decay the wa amplitude for the decay @xmath53 can be written as @xmath54 \\bar{l}\\gamma ^{\\mu } l   \\label{1a}\\]]where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the decay constants of @xmath34 and @xmath57 mesons , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the weak annihilation form factors which are calculated in qcd sum rules @xcite and can be parameterized as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 the values of the form factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 along with the given values of parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 were calculated by azizi et al .",
    "@xcite which are summarized in table i.    .@xmath66 form factors corresponding to wa in the qcd sum rules .",

    "we have carried out the study of invariant mass spectrum , forward - backward asymmetries , polarization asymmetries of final state @xmath11 meson and lepton in @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) decays in the standard model with extra sequential generation of quarks ( sm4 ) .",
    "particularly , we analyze the effects of fourth generation up - type quark mass @xmath73 and corresponding ckm matrix element @xmath74 to this process and our main outcomes can be summarized as follows :    * we have found that the branching ratios deviate sizably from that of the sm in almost all momentum transfer region .",
    "the study shows that the @xmath75 is an increasing function of the fourth generation parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 . at maximum values of these parameters , i.e. @xmath78 and @xmath79 gev , the values of @xmath75 increase approximately by 3 times of their sm values when the final leptons are muons or tauons .",
    "hence the accurate measurement of the @xmath75 for these decays is very important tool to explore physics beyond the sm . *",
    "the value of the forward - backward asymmetry decreases significantly from that of the sm value in sm4 when the mass of the fourth generation quark varies from @xmath3 gev to @xmath4 gev .",
    "the value of the zero position of forward - backward asymmetry shifted towards the left for all values of @xmath80 in @xmath81 decay .",
    "this shifting is significant for large values of the fourth generation ckm matrix elements @xmath82 and fourth generation top quark mass @xmath83 .",
    "as it is almost free from the hadronic uncertainties therefore this shifting will help us to find clues of the sm4 .",
    "* the polarization effects of final state @xmath11 meson and lepton are calculated in the sequential fourth generation sm4 .",
    "it is found that the sm4 effects are very promising , which could be measured at present and future experiments like lhcb where large numbers of @xmath84 pairs are expected to be produced .    in short",
    ", the precision measurements of these observables at tevatron and lhc will help us to find the indications of new physics encoded in the fourth generation parameters such as @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
