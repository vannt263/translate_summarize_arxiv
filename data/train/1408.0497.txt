    "the magnetic carpet typically contains magnetic features with magnetic flux ranging from @xmath0 mx , a part of which are kilo gauss flux tubes , also in the internetwork @xcite . the carpet is continually recycled with newly emerging flux replacing the pre - existing flux .",
    "magnetic elements split , merge , and cancel due to granular action  @xcite .",
    "additionally , recent observations show small - scale swirl events in the chromosphere , possibly due to the rotation of photospheric elements  . also , the magnetic elements display significant horizontal motions that can reach supersonic speeds  .",
    "all these dynamical aspects of the magnetic carpet make the overlying field non - potentiala source of magnetic energy  ( for a review on small - scale magnetic fields see * ? ? ?",
    "there is indirect observational evidence for the existence of non - potential structures in the quiet sun  @xcite .",
    "the vector magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) or its line - of - sight component ( @xmath2 ) at the photosphere is used to infer coronal fields , due to the unavailability of their direct measurements in corona .",
    "earlier studies of the co - evolution of magnetic carpet and coronal field were mainly through the potential field ( current - free ) extrapolations of the photospheric magnetic field ( for example , * ? ? ?",

    "recently ,  @xcite have used nonlinear force - free field extrapolations of the observed @xmath2 to study the magnetic energy storage and dissipation in the quiet sun corona .",

    "@xcite have used a 22 minute time sequence of very high resolution vector magnetograms to extrapolate the field into the upper atmosphere under the potential field assumption , and argued that the energy release through magnetic - reconnection is not likely to be the primary contributor to the heating of solar chromosphere and corona in the quiet sun . to test the basis of magnetic - reconnection between open and closed flux tubes as a plasma injection mechanism into the solar wind , @xcite used monte carlo simulations of the magnetic carpet .",
    "they also concluded that the slow or fast solar wind is unlikely to be driven by loop - opening processes through reconnections .",
    "the works of @xcite ( using models to study solar wind acceleration ) , and @xcite ( using observations to study solar atmospheric heating ) arrive at similar conclusions , disfavoring a significant role of the evolution of the magnetic carpet in supplying energy to the corona and solar wind , in contrast to  @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for the above conflicting results is that the potential field studies simplify the magnetic topology and do not include dynamic aspects like currents , and other nonlinear effects .",
    "also , as the methods of analysis are not the same , it may not be so straightforward to compare the results from those studies . with an ever increasing quality of the observations showing more intermittent flux filling the solar surface ,",
    "it is valid to inquire its contribution to the dynamics of the upper solar atmosphere and advance our knowledge towards a holistic picture of the magnetic connection from photosphere to corona , particularly in the quiet sun .    to rigorously address these issues , a continuous monitoring of the sun s magnetic field is desired",

    "* and references therein ) .    during the time evolution , the flux emergence , cancellation , along with splitting and merging of the elements are the possible ways of interactions among the magnetic elements at the corners of each grid .",
    "the los magnetic field reached a quasi - statistical equilibrium almost 15 hours after the initiation . during this time , the total magnetic flux increased from @xmath16 mx to @xmath17 mx . out of the total 48 hours of time evolution , which includes both the rise time and equilibrium period ,",
    "a portion of 8.5 hours time sequence is used for further analysis . the total flux in the source model fov roughly matches with that of the imax observations . in figure  [ context](c )",

    "there is an apparent rise in the non - potentiality with time , indicating the interaction of a newly emerging flux with the pre - existing coronal field .",
    "however , by combining the values of @xmath57 and @xmath54 , it can be seen that the coronal field over the hmi fov is potential .",
    "we note that in the bottom panel , @xmath67 for some points in time above a height of @xmath68 mm , which means a _ negative _ free energy .",
    "this is due to the fact that the surface integration is performed only over a sub - region within the full fov .",
    "the total volume integrated @xmath58 , however , remains positive .",
    "magnetic free energy is necessary but not sufficient to completely quantify the energy supply to solar corona .",
    "it is important to calculate the energy dissipation , and energy flux , which can then be directly compared with the observed radiative and conductive losses .",

    "the first and second parts on the right hand side of the equation  [ eq : disp ] are due to magneto - friction , and hyperdiffusion , respectively . to understand the evolution of @xmath72 with respect to height , at the time scale of minutes , we consider snapshots of @xmath72 from hmi simulations , separated by 15 minutes .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ sdo_disp ] .",
    "the top row shows @xmath2 ( lower boundary , ( a ) ) , and @xmath72 at three heights ( ( b ) : 2.2 mm , ( c ) : 4 mm , and ( d ) : 6.2 mm ) at 5.25 hrs into the simulation .",
    "bottom row is same as the top row , but 15 minutes after panels ( a)-(d ) . with very little change in the @xmath2 over the duration ,",
    "apparently , there is a drastic morphological change in @xmath72 ( panels ( b ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "this is very interesting to note , suggesting that the energy dissipation process due to magneto - friction and hyperdiffusion is _ non - localized _ in time ( i.e. , the locations of energy dissipation rapidly change with time ) .",
    "this in turn means that the time evolution of spatially averaged @xmath72 at any two locations separated by some distance ( having a different underlying magnetic morphology ) would be similar . in other words ,",
    "the average dissipation of magnetic energy is very uniform in our simulations .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath72 has a strong height dependence ( as seen in the greyscales of the right three panels ) .",
    "this was also indicated by  @xcite .",
    "these large - scale changes in the atmosphere are caused by small - scale random footpoint motions of magnetic elements at the photosphere .        to further quantify the above statements , figure  [ dissipat ] plots the horizontally averaged dissipation rate as a function of height and time .",

    "the width of each shaded band represent the range of minimum to maximum energy dissipated at that height .",
    "a vertical shaded rectangle is drawn to indicate the base of the transition region and corona .",
    "@xmath72 monotonically decreases with height in a similar way for regions with completely different underlying @xmath2 . in the top right panel ,",
    "results from the source model ( red ) , and imax ( blue ) are shown for comparison with those of hmi .",

    "we plot these results for the hmi simulations ( red : er ; blue : qr ; solid : 02 mm ; dashed : 24 mm ) .",
    "these plots show that on average , the energy dissipation is uniform over the entire fov and also fairly constant throughout the time evolution .",
    "another fact to notice is that @xmath72 reaches its statistically mean value very early in the simulations .",
    "recalling that the initial condition of the simulation is a potential field , the build - up of magnetic shear of coronal field and in turn the energy dissipation through hyperdiffusion , is contributing only a fraction of total @xmath72 .",

    "all sets have a flux of @xmath83 erg @xmath71 s@xmath4 at the photosphere .",
    "almost all of this flux is dissipated at heights below 2 mm , i.e. in the chromosphere ( for which , however , our model may not be valid , since the field below 10001500 km is not force - free ) . over a quiet sun ,",
    "the coronal base is typically above 3 mm  . at this layer , @xmath84 erg @xmath71 s@xmath4 , and",
    "@xmath85 erg @xmath71 s@xmath4 .",

    "these results indicate that the energy dissipation and flux are sensitive to the frictional coefficient , which can also be argued on the basis that the magneto - frictional energy is dominant in the simulations .",
    "with an aim to understand the role of the magnetic carpet in the heating of the solar corona , we simulated the coronal magnetic field using the disk center observations of quiet sun los magnetic field obtained from the _ sdo_/hmi and _ sunrise_/imax .",
    "to overcome the limitations of short duration imax data , we created a time sequence of synthetic magnetograms that roughly match the imax set in terms of the absolute flux ( figures  [ context][timeseries ] ) .",
    "a time series of the 3d nonlinear force - free magnetic field is constructed with the magnetograms as lower boundary conditions , and potential fields as initial conditions .",
    "the coronal field is evolved using equation  [ eq : ind ] , with a magneto - frictional relaxation technique ( equation  [ eq : mfr2 ] ) , including hyperdiffusion ( equation  [ eq : hd ] ) .",
    "we incorporated the non - force - free nature of the lower solar atmosphere ( @xmath100 mm ) by adding vertical flows that prevent the field from splaying out at the lower boundary ( equation  [ eq : mfr2 ] ) .",
    "these gentle flows weakly increased the field strength of the magnetic elements .",
    "next , we calculated @xmath54 , @xmath79 , and @xmath78 to quantitatively estimate the magnetic free energy , its dissipation , and energy flux injected at the base of corona .",
    "it is found that the energy dissipation in simulations with moderate resolution ( hmi ) , and much higher resolution ( imax / source model ) , is very similar close to the lower boundary . at low heights in these models",
    "most of the heating occurs in short , low - lying loops that originate from the mixed - polarity magnetic carpet .",
    "the average length of these loops is only a small fraction of the computational domain .",
    "further , these loops are highly intermittent , facilitating uniform energy dissipation over the entire surface . these loops can be formed by interactions of near - by elements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also from the newly emerging flux in the internetwork  @xcite .",
    "despite their intrinsic differences , imax and source model simulations are strikingly similar . moving away from the lower boundary , we see that @xmath101 decreases by more than two orders of magnitude at @xmath102 mm .",
    "this leaves only a few percent of @xmath77 at the coronal base .",
    "the energy flux into the corona as predicted by our model is approximately @xmath103 @xmath104 ( see the right panel of figure  [ eng_flux ] ) , which is about one order of magnitude smaller than the estimated radiative and conductive losses from the quiet - sun corona as derived from euv and x - ray observations .",
    "we conclude that the present model , which is based on evolving force - free magnetic fields and uses realistic photospheric boundary conditions , can not account for the observed coronal heating of the quiet sun .    .",
    "two thin vertical lines mark the period of 8.5 hours duration from which the time sequence of the source model is extracted for further analysis.[source_flux],scaledwidth=47.5% ]    @xcite used similar imax data to create a set of potential field models of the evolving magnetic carpet .",
    "they also concluded that the magnetic energy release associated with reconnections is not likely to supply the required energy to heat the chromosphere and corona .",
    "our estimate for the energy flux @xmath77 into the corona is below the upper limit provided by @xcite , indicating that flux estimates based on force - free - field modeling are consistent with those based on potential field modeling .",
    "however , both types of estimates are well below the values needed to heat the corona .",
    "this suggests that both potential - field and force - free - field models underestimate the amount of energy injected into the corona due to photospheric footpoint motions and other effects in the magnetic carpet .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising because these models make many simplifying assumptions about the structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere .",
    "for example , the models ignore the details of the lower atmosphere , where the density decreases with height over many orders of magnitude .",
    "also , the models assume that the coronal magnetic field evolves quasi - statically in response to the footpoint motions , whereas in reality the response may be more dynamic and significantly more energy may be injected in the form of alfvn waves  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the deficit in @xmath77 is smaller in the hmi set as compared to those of other models . assuming that this discrepancy is mainly due to the larger hmi volume more grid cells covering @xmath105 larger volume in physical space as compared to imax / source model volumes . ] , it means that there is a contribution from the long range magnetic connections , often reaching coronal heights , that was not possible with the imax set .",
    "this was also cited by  @xcite as a reason for their too low upper limit .",
    "future observations with high spatial resolution and large fovs are required to check and justify the contribution from long range magnetic interactions . also , imax and hmi observed mainly different kinds of features , with very different lifetimes . in the case of hmi",
    "it is predominantly network magnetic features ( including ephemeral regions ) and some internetwork fields , for imax it is dominated by internetwork fields .",
    "the latter are more likely to be horizontal and do not reach high into the atmosphere .",
    "additionally , imax observations were carried out in 2009 , at the depth of the last minimum in a very quiet part of the sun , while the hmi data were obtained in 2011 , i.e. when the sun was well on its way into the new cycle .",
    "a relatively large @xmath106 can be considered as a _",
    "basal _ flux to heat a diffused coronal region .",
    "compact features like xbps have a mean lifetime of eight hours @xcite , and an average emission height of 812 mm above the photosphere  .",
    "our model predicts a flux too small to account for the energy losses at those height ranges .",
    "another important issue to scrutinize here is the lower boundary condition itself .",
    "reliability of the extrapolations using the photospheric magnetic field has to be further reviewed .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the quiet sun model chromosphere is a non - force - free layer , and the extrapolations from the upper chromosphere may accurately yield the quiet sun field .",
    "further , our simulations do not capture the actual response of plasma to the dissipation , which is the determining factor when comparing the models with the emission maps of corona . also , it is possible that the energy released during events such as magnetic reconnection at some altitude can be dissipated at a different altitude due to reconnection - driven processes viz .",
    "jets , outflows , and waves  @xcite .",
    "these processes are not included in the present simulations .",
    "thus a detailed mhd description is necessary to evaluate the role of the magnetic carpet in the heating of solar atmosphere . to conclude ,",
    "our results show that the energy flux associated with quasi - static processes ( here modeled using magneto - friction and hyperdiffusion ) are not sufficient to heat the quiet solar corona .",
    "although this suggests that the evolution of the magnetic carpet ( through magnetic splitting , merging , cancellation , and emergence ) without invoking any other reconnection - driven and wave mechanisms , does not play a dominant role in the coronal energy supply , a final judgment can be passed only with better observational constraints of magnetic field , in particular , at the force - free upper chromospheric layer .",
    "observations from the next generation instruments such as the advanced technology solar telescope , and the solar - c , which can offer multi - wavelength coverage with excellent spectro - polarimetric sensitivity , and large fovs , will shed light on these issues .",
    "the authors thank the referee for many comments and suggestions that helped in improving the presentation of the work .",

    "funding for l.p.c . and e.e.d .",

    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .",
    "in this section we consider a model for the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field of the quiet sun .",
    "the field is assumed to consists of a collection of discrete flux elements or `` sources '' .",
    "each source has an associated magnetic flux , which can be positive or negative , but the combined flux of all sources is assumed to vanish . each source has a gaussian flux distribution with radius @xmath107 km .",
    "the spatial distribution of the sources continually evolves due to several processes : ( 1 ) random motions driven by sub - surface convective flows , ( 2 ) splitting and merging of like - polarity sources , ( 3 ) mutual cancellation of opposite - polarity sources , and ( 4 ) emergence of new bipoles . to simulate these processes ,",
    "we introduce a hexagonal grid with an edge length @xmath108 mm .",
    "initially , the sources are centered at randomly selected vertices of the hexagonal grid ( where 3 edges come together ) ; subsequently they start moving along the edges of the grid .",
    "each source has an equal probability ( 0.25 ) of moving along one of the three edges connecting to its original vertex , or remaining fixed at that vertex .",
    "the motion occurs with constant speed , @xmath109 @xmath110 , so that at time @xmath111 all moving sources again reach a neighboring vertex .",
    "then the process repeats itself , producing a random walk of the sources along the grid edges .",
    "therefore , in the present model all sources periodically return to the vertices ( at times @xmath112 with @xmath113 ) .",
    "the magnetic sources interact with each other only at vertices of the hexagons .",
    "for example , when two sources meet at a vertex , they are forced to merge or partially cancel each other , depending on their magnetic polarity . also , each source has a probability of splitting in two , which only occurs at a vertex so that the two parts may move away from each other along different edges .",
    "the emergence of a bipole is modeled by inserting a new pair of flux - balanced sources at a vertex and allowing the two sources to move apart along different edges of the grid .",
    "the newly inserted sources have absolute fluxes in the range @xmath114 mx .",
    "figure  [ elements ] illustrates various interactions between sources : ( a ) flux emergence , ( b ) emergence and subsequent partial cancellation , ( c ) splitting of an element , ( d ) total flux cancellation .",
    "each panel has two segments .",
    "the top segment shows the time sequence of the respective interaction ( the numbers given in the snapshots indicate time , in minutes , elapsed since an arbitrary start time ) , and the bottom segment shows the magnetic flux vs.  time .",
    "flux merging , and self - cancellation of a newly emerged bipole are other possible ways in which the elements interact .",
    "we emphasize that the motivation behind the source model is not to create a realistic magnetic flux distribution for the quiet sun , but rather to have a model with an average flux density similar to that obtained in the imax observations .",
    "the simulation is initiated with 50 magnetic sources with magnetic fluxes in the range @xmath115 mx .",
    "figure  [ source_flux ] shows the integrated flux of the sources ( i.e. , the sum of absolute values of fluxes ) as function of time .",
    "the initial phase of the model is dominated by flux emergence .",
    "after 15 hours into the evolution , the integrated flux reached a statistical equilibrium of @xmath17 mx .",
    "this is due to the balance between the new flux emergence and partial / complete cancellation of the magnetic elements .",
    "the two thin vertical lines mark the period of evolution ( 8.5 hours ) chosen for the main source model analysis presented in this work . in total ,",
    "2000 bipoles emerged in the complete time evolution of the model ( 360 during the 8.5 hour period ) .",
    "the average rate of flux emergence is about 150 @xmath116 , which is a factor three less than the value reported by  @xcite .",
    "however , their study included a much wider range of flux emergence events ( @xmath117@xmath118mx ) ."
