    "long - term measurement and monitoring of vital signs , _ e. g. _ heart rate , respiratory rate , body temperature and blood pressure , _ etc . _ , provides promise for the early treatment of any potential problems , especially for older adults .",
    "compared with the many wearable heartrate monitoring systems available , ballistocardiography provides an unintrusive and , thus , comfortable monitoring alternative .",
    "these systems record the motion of the human body generated by the sudden ejection of blood into the large vessels at each cardiac cycle @xcite .",
    "this technique has gained revived interest due to recent development in measurement technology @xcite and a growing preference for `` aging in place '' @xcite .",
    "a hydraulic bed sensor system @xcite has been recently developed to non - invasively collect the superposition of the ballistocardiogram ( bcg ) and respiration signals .",
    "the motivation for this work is to support continuous , non - intrusive monitoring of vital signs of older adults in an unstructured natural living environment .",
    "the hydraulic bed sensor is placed beneath the mattress and has shown to be flexible , low - cost and non - intrusive for monitoring an individuals heartrate .",
    "compared with other methods such as electrocardiography ( ecg ) , bcg does not need electrodes or clips to be affixed to the patient s body and thus is ideal for long term in - home monitoring .",
    "however , the lack of saliency and large variability in a bcg signal makes it much more difficult to detect individual heartbeats than with an ecg .    multiple - instance learning ( mil )",
    "is a variation on supervised learning for problems with incomplete training label information @xcite . in mil",
    ", training data are grouped into positive and negative `` bags . ''",
    "a bag is defined to be a multi - set of data points in which a positive bag contains at least one data point from the target class and negative bags are composed entirely of non - target data .",
    "thus , data point - specific training labels are unavailable . given training data in this form , the majority of mil methods either : ( 1 ) learn target concepts for describing the target class ; or ( 2 ) train a classifier that can distinguish between individual target and non - target data points . here , _",
    "concepts _ refer to generalized class prototypes in the feature space ; in the case of heartbeat characterization , a concept is the discriminative heartbeat pattern of an individual .",
    "this paper proposes to estimate a personalized heartbeat concept and , given this concept , perform heartbeat detection and heartrate estimation from bcg signals .",
    "the proposed method for addressing this goal is the application of the extended function of multiple instances ( @xmath0fumi ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "@xmath0fumi is well suited to the problem of heartbeat characterization from bcg signals as it is able to address multiple types of uncertainty in training data .",
    "namely , @xmath0fumi addresses mixed data samples and inaccurate labels in training data ; both are common in bcg analysis .",
    "the hydraulic bed sensor is composed of a transducer and a pressure sensor . the transducer is 53.5 cm long and 6 cm wide , and is filled with 0.4 liter of water @xcite .",
    "the integrated silicon pressure sensor ( freescale mpx5010gp ) attached to the end of the transducer is used for measuring the vibration of the discharged hose .",
    "four transducers are placed in parallel underneath the mattress to provide enough coverage of the pulse from the heartbeat .",
    "[ fig : bed_system ] and [ fig : bed_transducer ] show the hydraulic bed sensor system and placement of the 4 transducers , respectively .",
    "the four transducers are identical , but the data quality collected by those 4 transducers could vary depending on the sleeping position , type of mattress and the physical characteristics of the subject .            given the described hydraulic bed sensor , a bcg data set was collected for several people lying on their backs in the bed setup described above for 10 minutes each and a subset data containing bcg signal of four subjects was tested by the proposed method .",
    "the bcg signal was sampled at 100 hz and filtered by a butterworth band - pass filter with 3db cutoff at 0.4 hz and 10 hz to remove respiratory effects and high frequency noise .",
    "the study was approved by the university of missouri institutional review board .",
    "also , for ground - truthing , a piezoelectric pulse sensor ( adinstruments mlt1010 ) attached to subject s finger is used to record the pulse ejected by a heartbeat .",
    "[ fig : bcg_fs_plot ] shows a typical filtered bcg signal collected by one transducer and the corresponding finger sensor ground truth information , where the green circles denote every peak location of the filtered bcg signal . in this figure",
    ", we can see that there are prominent peak patterns , that appear near the ground truth locations denoted by finger sensor .",
    "however , although both of the sensors are assumed to be capturing a corresponding heartbeat signal simultaneously , there is some misalignment between the finger sensor and bcg pressure sensor . also , it is possible that one or more transducers fail to collect a clear heartbeat signal depending on the location and position of the subject in the bed .",
    "these uncertainties in the training data make it more difficult to apply traditional supervised learning methods for heartbeat detection or heart rate estimation on bcg signal .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to introduce the idea of training `` bags '' to address label uncertainty as well as mis - collection of heartbeat signals in the bcg data .",
    "specifically , we extract several bcg sub - segments ( each 81 points long corresponding to 0.81s ) that are centered on each peak in the bcg training data .",
    "each of these sub - segments are then treated as individual data points ( or `` instances '' ) during training .",
    "[ fig : bcg_fs_plot ] shows all peak locations in a sample bcg signal . in order to form the positive training bags ,",
    "the 3 instances from each transducer that are closest in time to the ground - truth location marked by the finger sensor were grouped together .",
    "similarly , all instances that are not placed in a positive bag , are grouped together to form one negative bag .",
    "[ fig : pos_bag_plot ] plots one randomly picked positive bag , where we can see a positive bag is mixed with false positive data ( green plots ) and the four assumed true positive data ( red plots ) are not guaranteed to be all heartbeat signal . by applying the @xmath0fumi algorithm to these training bags , we want to learn a representative and discriminative heartbeat concept .",
    "then , any signature based detection algorithm could be applied for heartbeat detection and heart rate estimation on testing data .",

    "however , the exact number of data points in a positive bag with a target contribution ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) , is unknown .",
