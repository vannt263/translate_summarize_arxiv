    "the aim of this paper is to examine the interplay between simple , singly or doubly excited `` doorway '' states , and multiply excited chaotic eigenstates ( compound resonances ) in processes , such as photon and electron scattering , photoionization , electron recombination , etc . , involving complex atomic or molecular systems .",
    "in particular , we identify the coherent and incoherent contributions of the compound resonances , and show how these are related to the total and partial cross sections of various reactions .",
    "we outline a method for the calculation of probabilities of these reactions , which involves summations over the doorway states , rather than the eigenstates .",
    "consider a finite quantum system with many degrees of freedom , such as a many - electron atom or ion , a polyatomic molecule , or a heavy nucleus . in the zeroth - order approximation",
    ", the states of such system can be constructed from some single - particle states . for atoms",
    "these will be the electron orbitals obtained in some mean - field potential , e.g. , using the hartree - fock method . for molecular vibrations , the zeroth - order states are normal - mode vibrations , which are determined by the quadratic expansion of the ground - state electronic energy near the equilibrium positions of the nuclei .",
    "in general , this description works well for the ground state of the system , and in many cases , it also provides a correct picture of low - lying excitations .",
    "thus , the ground states of most atoms and ions are characterized by their electronic _",
    "configuration_. the ground state of the molecular vibrational hamiltonian is simply a product of the zero - point motion states of all the normal modes .",
    "low - energy excitations then correspond to promotions of one of the electrons into an excited - state orbital , or adding a vibrational quantum to one of the normal - mode harmonic oscillators .",
    "of course , the exact energy of the atomic excitation will be affected by the _",
    "residual _ two - body coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "such correction can be relatively small in atoms or ions with a simple ground - state configuration ( e.g. , in alkali - like systems with one active electron above a closed - shell core ) . at the same time , in systems with several valence electrons , and in particular , with open - shell ground - state configurations , the single - particle picture does not hold well at all . a state in which one of the electrons is promoted to a higher - lying orbital will be _ mixed _ with other excited states , in which two or three electrons have changed their places .",
    "such effects are usually described as configuration mixing .",
    "finding the eigenstates of the system then requires constructing a basis of many - electron states of the relevant electronic configurations , and diagonalizing the hamiltonian of the residual interaction in this basis .",
    "similarly , accurate vibrational energies can be found by including anharmonic , e.g. , cubic and quartic , terms in the vibrational hamiltonian and diagonalizing its matrix , constructed using the zeroth - order ( harmonic ) basis states .",
    "a practical limitation to this approach is set by the maximum size of a matrix that can be diagonalized efficiently on a computer .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix sizes become very large in atomic systems with open @xmath0 and @xmath1 shells , due to a large number of active electrons , or in polyatomic molecules with many vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "such systems are characterized by large densities of the energy spectra , which promotes strong mixing of the zeroth - order basis states . as a result ,",
    "each of the eigenstates becomes a superposition of a large number of basis states , with the expansion coefficients behaving like random variables .",
    "further , these eigenstates often can not be assigned any meaningful quantum numbers , except the exact ones , such as the total angular momentum or parity . even when the hamiltonian matrix sizes are manageable , `` exact '' calculations of the spectra and processes in such systems are virtually impossible due to the extreme sensitivity of the eigenvalues to small perturbations , e.g. , the effect of states omitted from the basis , or higher - order corrections to the perturbation .    ( 0,0 ) ( 3,164)@xmath2 ( 256,164)@xmath3        this behaviour of quantum systems is termed _",
    "quantum chaos_. besides the gaussian statistics of the eigenstate components , there is also a specific correlation between the energy eigenvalues , which is characteristic of the spectra of random matrices @xcite .",
    "well - known examples of quantum - chaotic systems are excited heavy nuclei ( e.g. , those formed by neutron capture ) @xcite , and heavy atoms and ions with open @xmath1 shells , such as ce or au@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "another example is given by the vibrational motion of polyatomic molecules where anharmonic mixing between normal modes leads to intramolecular vibrational redistribution ( ivr ) @xcite .",
    "chaotic resonances have also been found recently in ultracold collisions of erbium atoms @xcite ( a manifestation of chaotic states in the excited er@xmath5 molecule ) .    in each of these examples the quantum - chaotic behaviour of the system",
    "leads to important observable effects beyond the energy - level statistics .",
    "narrowly spaced neutron resonances in heavy nuclei provide strong enhancements of parity nonconservation due to the weak interaction @xcite .",
    "electron capture in chaotic multielectronic resonances in open - shell ions results in recombination rates @xmath6@xmath7 times greater than the single - particle radiative recombination rate @xcite , as seen in many experiments @xcite .",
    "similar states feature in photoionization and photoemission in many ions , producing a complex interplay of broad and narrow resonances @xcite .",
    "ivr is an essential step in most chemical reactions .",
    "it also plays a key role in electron attachment and positron annihilation in polyatomic molecules @xcite .      while the exact calculation of many - body chaotic eigenstates is impossible , their nature allows one to develop a statistical theory to calculate the mean - squared values of matrix elements and amplitudes involving such states @xcite . in this way one can predict observables averaged over a small energy interval containing many such states ( which is often sufficient since",
    "the individual states can not be resolved experimentally ) .    of particular importance in this approach are _ doorway _ states .",
    "a doorway is a state which is coupled in the lowest order to the initial state .",
    "for example , in electron - ion recombination , doorways are dielectronic states ( i.e. , 1-hole-2-particle excitations of the combined ion ) . in molecular infrared photoabsorption , doorways are single - mode excitations . in considering the ivr process of a single - mode excitations ,",
    "the doorways are two- and three - quantum vibrational excitations coupled to the single - mode excitation in the lowest order .    to illustrate these examples , fig .",
    "[ fig : ivr_rec ] ( a ) shows schematically the absorption of an infrared photon of energy @xmath8 by a polyatomic molecule , followed by ivr . figure [ fig : ivr_rec ] ( b ) describes the recombination of an electron with energy @xmath9 with a multicharged positive ion @xmath10 .    in the description of both processes ,",
    "we adopt a _ temporal _ picture of the dynamics , as if probed by a short initial pulse .",
    "this picture is observed directly in the pump - probe studies of molecular ivr @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the electron - ion recombination usually deals with incident electrons of definite energy .",
    "( in spite of the high energy resolution achieved in experiments with electron coolers in ion storage rings @xcite , the measurements for complex targets are incapable of resolving individual chaotic resonances .",
    ", when compared with the excitation energy of the ion ( e.g. , au@xmath4 or w@xmath11 ) formed in the recombination event . in contrast , the frequency spread of @xmath12  @xmath13 achieved in high - resolution molecular spectroscopy @xcite , is about @xmath14 of the vibrational energy probed , so the experiment is capable of detecting individual `` bath '' states . ] )      in the process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivr_rec ] ( a ) , the energy of the photon is tuned to the frequency of the normal mode 1 ( e.g. , a ch or oh stretch mode , with @xmath15  @xmath13 ) . in the first step",
    "the photon excites a single - quantum vibration of this mode .",
    "lowest - order ( cubic and quartic ) anharmonic couplings @xmath16 perturbatively couple this initial state to some two- or three - mode vibrational excitations .",
    "these off - resonance states act as `` doorways '' which mediate the _ spreading _ of the vibrational energy into more complex multi - mode vibrational states , whose density is much higher than that of the modes or doorways .",
    "if @xmath16 is sufficiently strong ( and suitable doorway states are available ) , the excitation ultimately spreads into the `` bath '' of closely - spaced states @xcite .",
    "this is the essence of the ivr process .",
    "its time scale @xmath17 , is related to the energy width of the initial single - mode state with respect to its decay towards the bath states .",
    "high - resolution molecular spectroscopy in fact allows one to observe these states as clumps of narrowly spaced absorption lines within @xmath18 energy interval of the vibrational fundamental @xcite .",
    "the number of such lines is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total density of the vibrational spectrum for a given symmetry , at this energy .      turning to the second process [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ivr_rec ] ( b ) ] , the ground state of the target ion @xmath10 is usually a simple state described by a single dominant electronic configuration .",
    "the coulomb interaction @xmath21 between the incident and target electrons couples the initial state ( @xmath22 ) to the doubly excited states of the compound ion @xmath23 .",
    "in such states two electrons occupy some excited - state orbitals ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , leaving a hole in one of the target ground - state orbitals ( @xmath26 ) . for simple targets , photoemission from the doubly excited",
    "state completes the _ dielectronic recombination _",
    "process @xcite .    for open - shell targets such as au@xmath27 ( with @xmath28 outer orbital ground - state configuration ) ,",
    "the dielectronic resonances are embedded in a dense spectrum of multiply excited states and are strongly mixed with them @xcite . in the temporal picture this mixing describes a rapid decay of the dielectronic excited states into chaotic `` compound states '' ( a term which originated in nuclear physics , sometimes called feshbach resonances @xcite ) .",
    "its time constant @xmath29 is determined by the so - called _ spreading width _",
    "@xmath30 , as @xmath31 .",
    "( it plays the same role as @xmath18 in the first example , but on a completely different scale , e.g. , @xmath32  ev in au@xmath4 . ) in the energy eigenstate picture , each of the dielectronic states appears as a component in many chaotic compound states , contributing significantly to @xmath33 of them ( @xmath34 being the small level spacing between the compound states ) .    as a result of this spreading , the weight of every doorway in a given compound state is @xmath35 , and the probability for the compound states to autoionize ( i.e. , re - emit the electron ) is greatly reduced ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "on the other hand , their lifetimes with respect to emitting a photon are similar to those of the dielectronic ( and singly excited ) states , since any excited electron in the compound state can radiate .",
    "the electron `` trapping '' in the chaotic compound states thus leads to strongly increased recombination rates @xcite .",
    "specific examples of doorway states for electron recombination with au@xmath27 can be found in table i of ref .",
    "@xcite , while mixing of doorways with chaotic states was explored in ref .",
    ".    the energy spacing between the compound states can be very small ( see , e.g. , the estimates for au@xmath4 in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , beyond the best resolution available in the recombination experiments @xcite .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the recombination cross section is completely structureless .",
    "the dielectronic doorway states can produce broad maxima with widths @xmath37 in the energy dependence of the cross section .",
    "this is similar to the way in which the frequencies and strengths of vibrational fundamentals determine the overall infrared absorption spectrum of a polyatomic molecule . here",
    "the normal modes excited by the photon play the role of doorways for the ivr which follows molecular photoabsorption .    in what follows we consider a variety of processes initiated by a photon or electron impact on a complex atomic or molecular system .",
    "we aim to determine the roles played by the simple doorway states and chaotic , compound states in each case .",
    "although most of the expressions and conclusions are quite general , we will use the language of atoms ( or ions ) and atomic processes , with the many degrees of freedom and complexity ( chaos ) arising from the large numbers of active electrons and available orbitals .",
    "in isolated quantum many - body systems chaos emerges due to a rapid , exponential growth of the level density with energy .",
    "this growth is caused by the increase in the number of active particles promoted into unoccupied orbitals , following the increase in the excitation energy of the system . when the residual interaction between the particles is greater than the energy spacing between the levels that it mixes , the eigenstates @xmath38 become chaotic superpositions of the basis states @xmath39 , constructed from the single - particle orbitals ( e.g. , slater determinants , for the fermi system ) . in this regime",
    "the coefficients in the eigenstate expansion , @xmath40 note that we use indices @xmath41 , @xmath42 , etc . , to denote the compound eigenstates , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , etc .",
    ", for the basis states , and the averages are taken over nearby eigenstates .    for the system under consideration",
    "the hamiltonian matrix @xmath45 and the coefficients @xmath46 can be made real .",
    "we also assume that the basis states and the eigenstates have the same exact quantum numbers ( e.g. , the total angular momentum and parity , for a spherically symmetric system ) , and the usual normalization condition applies : @xmath47 .    besides eq .",
    "( [ sc0 ] ) , the coefficients display a systematic dependence on the eigenstate energy",
    ". this dependence can be described by ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the energy eigenvalue of state @xmath42 , @xmath50 is the expectation energy of the basis state @xmath44 , and @xmath34 is the mean energy spacing between the eigenstates .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is the spreading width .",
    "it characterizes the size of the energy interval in which the typical coefficients are close to maximum , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , is the number of _ principal components _ ,",
    "i.e. , the number of basis states that contribute significantly to a given eigenstate . in the strong mixing regime , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the spreading width can be calculated using the golden rule as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mean spacing between the states @xmath44 to which a given basis state @xmath43 is coupled @xcite , or evaluated in relatively small scale configuration - interaction calculations @xcite .",
    "its values in atomic systems range from @xmath57  ev in atoms , such as ce @xcite , to @xmath58  ev in multicharged ions , e.g. , au@xmath4 @xcite , or w@xmath59 ( @xmath6024 ) @xcite .",
    "let us consider the process of photoexcitation of a many - electron atom or ion @xmath61 from the ground state @xmath62 to an excited state @xmath38 above the ionization limit .",
    "this leads to either autoionization ( @xmath63 ) or radiative quenching of the excited state ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes are @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the electron - photon interaction operator , @xmath8 is the photon energy , and @xmath67 is the electron coulomb interaction .",

    "the sums are over the compound eigenstates @xmath42 with the energy @xmath49 and total width @xmath72 ( due to both autoionization and radiative decay ) .    note that in considering the photon impact we neglect the possibility of direct electron emission into the continuum .",
    "such process will either produce a distinct , smooth background for the resonant contributions , or , more likely for complex targets , the continuum states will be strongly mixed with the autoionizing resonances @xcite .",

    "simple single - electron excitation doorways do not have a dense spectrum , which means that @xmath169 may be small , making all three contributions comparable .    on the other hand , if the energy of the incident photon is sufficiently large , inelastic ( raman ) photon scattering becomes much more prominent due to the availability of many excited final states @xmath41 .",

    "a possible way of observing this effect in experiment is to measure and compare the total photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections .",
    "alternatively , one can measure the spectrum of secondary photon from the resonant raman scattering , varying the primary photon energy across the ionization threshold .",
    "in this work we have investigated the role of doorway states in electron- and photon - induced reactions mediated by strongly mixed compound resonances .",
    "our analysis shows that the resonance - averaged total reaction cross sections @xmath115 are given by the coherent contributions of the compound resonances .",
    "these cross sections are expressed in terms of doorway resonances ( i.e. , simple states coupled directly to the initial state of the target ) .",
    "the only difference with the standard approach for dielectronic recombination and photoionization is that the doorway resonances are broadened by the spreading width @xmath30 , which described their coupling to the dense spectrum of chaotic compound states .",
    "the situation with the partial cross sections is more complicated . for processes such as radiative electron capture ( photorecombination ) or photon scattering at energies which place the system in the strong - mixing regime , the number of the decay channels is very large . as a result , the stochastic contribution",

    "the ( resonance - averaged ) partial cross section can then be calculated from the total cross section by including the appropriate branching ratio , e.g. , @xmath201 , for photorecombination . here",
    "the ratio of the radiative and total widths of the compound resonances and the electron capture cross section @xmath202 can be calculated as in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the process leads to electron emission ( photoionization , electron scattering ) and the number of decay channels is small ( i.e. , the energy does not exceed threshold by much ) , the independent - resonance approximation may be deficient and the coherent contribution may need to be included .",
