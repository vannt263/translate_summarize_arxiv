    "atomic fermi gas systems have generated much interest in the last several years  @xcite .",
    "while these systems can be well - described by a relatively simple model hamiltonian , at low temperatures they exhibit a rich phenomenology whose theoretical description has proven to be challenging . at low momenta , or when",
    "the range of the interaction is sufficiently short , the dominant scattering process occurs in the @xmath0-wave channel , so that a single parameter , the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 , suffices to characterize the inter - particle interaction .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the fermi momentum ) , widely different behavior is observed .",
    "this ranges from the formation of tightly bound dimers in the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) regime when @xmath2 is small and positive , to cooper pairing in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) regime when @xmath2 is small and negative .",
    "these behaviors are connected by a strongly interacting , nonperturbative regime , known as the unitary regime , where @xmath4 is much larger than any other length scale in the system .",
    "remarkably , each of these regimes is accessible experimentally , and all exhibit superfluid behavior below a certain @xmath1-dependent critical temperature .",
    "while accurate mean - field theories exist for the bec and bcs regimes , there is no simple approximation that can accurately describe the transition between these regimes through the unitary limit . as a result",
    "much interest has been taken in applying numerical methods , such as quantum monte carlo and numerical diagonalization . for systems varying from @xmath5 to hundreds of particles ,",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations have been carried out to calculate ground state  @xcite and thermodynamic properties  @xcite . for smaller numbers of trapped atoms , energy spectra",
    "have been calculated using a basis set expansion method with correlated gaussians in coordinate space ( for up to six atoms )  @xcite and a stochastic variational approach ( for four atoms )  @xcite .",
    "the three - body problem has been solved analytically in the unitary regime  @xcite and numerically to high accuracy along the bec - bcs crossover  @xcite .",
    "in fact the few - body trapped cold atom problem has become more interesting recently , since it was pointed out that the virial expansion for the partition function in a harmonic trap works well at unexpectedly low temperatures into the quantum degenerate regime  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the scaling relations which exist for the dilute gas can allow larger systems to be addressed from the study of smaller ones  @xcite .    here we discuss the cold atom problem in the context of the configuration - interaction ( ci ) approach to interacting many - particle fermionic systems . in this approach , widely used in atomic , molecular and nuclear physics , a single - particle basis in the laboratory frame is used to construct a many - particle basis of slater determinants for a fixed number of fermions .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is then calculated in this many - particle basis and diagonalized . for a harmonically trapped system , a natural choice for the single - particle basis is that of the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "the short - range interaction of the cold atom problem is often approximated by a zero - range interaction .",
    "however , the obvious form of such a potential , a contact interaction @xmath6 , is ill - defined in three dimensions and must be regularized .",
    "this is usually accomplished by introducing a momentum or energy cutoff in relative motion and renormalizing the strength @xmath7 of the interaction so it reproduces the physical scattering length for the uniform gas , or the lowest bound state energy in relative motion for the trapped system .",
    "the many - particle energies are then calculated as a function of the regularization cutoff parameter .",
    "a contact interaction is non - vanishing only for relative angular momenta @xmath8 of the two particles . for a basis of harmonic oscillator wave functions ,",
    "a natural regularization parameter is the number of oscillator @xmath0 waves in relative motion .",
    "however , the convergence of the many - particle energies as a function of this regularization parameter for the renormalized contact interaction is slow ( as a low negative power )  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "a new effective interaction was introduced in the unitary limit for which the low - lying energies of the three- and four - particle systems converge substantially faster than for the conventional renormalized contact interaction as a function of the regularization parameter .",
    "while this effective interaction is no longer a contact interaction , it reproduces the same many - particle energies in the limit when the regularization parameter is sent to infinity .",
    "the faster convergence of the many - particle energies enables their calculation to higher accuracy when using this new effective interaction .",
    "another approach to improve the convergence relative to the renormalized contact interaction was investigated within the framework of effective field theory by including perturbatively next - to - leading order and next - to - next - to - leading order interactions  @xcite .    here",
    "we generalize the construction of such an effective interaction away from unitarity .",
    "we study the low - energy spectra of the three- and four - particle systems and find convergence properties versus the regularization parameter along the complete bec - bcs crossover that are similar to the unitary regime .",
    "we also use this effective interaction to study the thermodynamics of the three - particle system at unitarity .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate the exponential convergence of the free energy at finite temperature as a function of the regularization parameter .",
    "the converged free energy is compared with the exact free energy constructed from the known analytical spectrum of the three - particle system  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "slowromancap3@ , we derive closed expressions for the matrix elements of the new effective interaction for any scattering length and demonstrate convergence ( as a function of the regularization parameter ) of its two - particle eigentates to the exact eigenstates in the unitary limit . in sec .",
    "slowromancap4@ , we use this interaction to study the convergence ( vs. the regularization parameter ) of the spectra of the three- and four - body systems along the bec - bcs crossover and the three - particle free energy at unitarity .",

    "the trapped two species cold atom system is modeled by the hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the number of atoms for each species ( spin - up and spin - down ) , @xmath13 is the trap frequency , and @xmath14 is a short - range interaction . a natural length scale for this hamiltonian is the oscillator length @xmath15 .",
    "the interaction @xmath14 is modeled by a zero - range , pure @xmath0-wave interaction , which due to pauli exclusion acts only between particles of differing species .",
