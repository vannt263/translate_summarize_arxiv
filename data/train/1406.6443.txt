    "the study of electromagnetic properties of hadrons has attracted a lot of interest for many years .",
    "though qcd is the fundamental theory to describe the strong interaction , it is difficult to apply it directly to study the hadron properties due to the non - perturbative property .",
    "there are many phenomenological models based on hadron or quark level such as cloudy bag model @xcite , the constituent quark model @xcite , the @xmath1 expansion approach @xcite , the perturbative chiral quark model @xcite , non - local quark meson coupling model @xcite , the extended vector meson dominance model @xcite , the quark - diquark model @xcite and the schwinger - dyson formalism @xcite , etc .    as well as the above model calculations , there are also many lattice - qcd studies of the electromagnetic form factors . significant efforts to probe baryon electromagnetic structure in lattice qcd have been driven by the adelaide group @xcite , the cyprus group @xcite , and the qcdsf @xcite and lhp collaborations @xcite .",
    "though lattice qcd is the most rigorous approach , most quantities are simulated with large quark ( @xmath2 ) mass because of the computing limitations .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to extrapolate the lattice data to the physical @xmath2 mass .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt ) is a systematic tool in studying hadron physics and the lagrangian is well defined and based on the chiral symmetry which is the same as qcd .",
    "various formulations of @xmath3pt have also been widely applied to study the hadron properties .",
    "@xcite . to deal with the divergence of the loop integral ,",
    "most formulations of @xmath3pt are based on dimensional or infrared regularization . with dimensional regularization , it has been observed that expansions in @xmath3pt are consistent with experimental results up to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "extensions of @xmath3pt to explicitly incorporate vector mesons have been demonstrated to improve the applicability to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "an alternative regularization method , namely finite - range - regularization ( frr ) is widely applied in the chiral extrapolation of the lattice data .",
    "a ultraviolet regulator reflects the structure of hadrons is introduced in the loop integral .",
    "frr effective field theory ( eft ) was first applied in the extrapolation of the nucleon mass and magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "the remarkably improved convergence properties of the frr expansion mean that lattice data at large pion masses can be described very well and the nucleon mass obtained at the physical pion mass compared favorably with the experimental value .",
    "later , the frr method was applied to extrapolate the vector meson mass , magnetic moments , magnetic form factors , strange form factors , charge radii , first moments of gpds , etc .",
    "@xcite .    therefore , to study the hadron properties at relatively large @xmath0 and pion mass .",
    "it is important to consider the size effect of the hadrons . in the previous work",
    ", we proposed a new quantization condition , i.e. solid quantization @xcite . with the solid quantization ,",
    "the modified propagators of the hadrons as well as the non - local interaction are obtained .",
    "compared with the frr eft , the ultraviolet regulator can be derived from the lagrangian . in this paper",
    ", we will apply the non - local lagrangian in the heavy baryon formalism to study the nucleon magnetic form factors up to relatively large @xmath0 .",

    ", we briefly introduce the formalism in this section . in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory , the lowest chiral lagrangian for the baryon - meson interaction which will be used in the calculation of the nucleon magnetic moments , including the octet and decuplet baryons , is expressed as    @xmath6 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -i\\bar{t}_v^\\mu(v\\cdot { \\cal d})t_{v\\mu } + { \\cal c}(\\bar{t}_v^\\mu a_\\mu b_v+\\bar{b}_v a_\\mu t_v^\\mu),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the covariant spin - operator defined as @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the nucleon four velocity ( in the rest frame , we have @xmath10 ) .",

    "when @xmath0 is larger than about 0.4 gev@xmath132 , there is no visible contribution from the meson loop .",
    "this result can be easy understood from the meson cloud picture where the 3-quark core of nucleon is surrounded by the meson cloud . at low energy transfer ,",
