    "in fluid flow inertia has in general a destabilizing effect , whereas viscous forces tend to quickly restore smooth motion . the balance between the two is expressed in the dimensionless reynolds number @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are a characteristic length and velocity , respectively , and @xmath3 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid . as  is increased",
    "laminar flows tend to be unstable , and in some special cases it is even possible to determine a critical reynolds number by linearizing the governing equations .",
    "however , in shear flows such as pipe , channel and couette flows turbulence occurs in experiments for sufficiently strong perturbations @xcite in parameter regimes where the steady laminar flow is stable to infinitesimal disturbances .",
    "one of the striking features of linearly stable flows , first recognized by osborne reynolds , is that disordered and smooth motion can coexist @xcite . here",
    "turbulence is at onset restricted to localized patches ( called puffs in pipe flow ) embedded in a laminar background .",
    "recently , streamwise - localized solutions of the navier  stokes equations that share key spatial properties with puffs but are time - periodic have been discovered @xcite .",
    "although turbulent puffs are transient @xcite , spatial proliferation in the form of splitting can balance the decay of individual puffs and lead to an overall sustainment of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the persistent turbulent state emerging through this non - equilibrium phase transition , occurring at @xmath4 @xcite , consists of a spatially - temporally intermittent flow where individual turbulent clusters are transient but proliferate faster than they decay . at the same time turbulence",
    "can only be sustained locally , driven by the upstream laminar motion @xcite . at the downstream end",
    "the plug like velocity profile needs to recover towards the laminar parabolic profile before a new turbulent region can arise .",
    "this results in a minimum spacing of turbulent clusters @xcite and an effective recovery length @xcite . at higher  puffs",
    "are superseded by continuously growing structures called slugs @xcite , and it is usually assumed that given sufficient time turbulence will fill the entire pipe . this state depleted of laminar intermissions will in the following be referred to as fully turbulent flow .",
    "althoguh laminar - turbulent intermittency was first reported in the early experiments of reynolds @xcite , the probably first quantitative characterization of intermittency in pipes was provided by rotta @xcite . in his experiments",
    "he continuously disturbed the flow at the pipe inlet to generate turbulence and monitored its evolution at different downstream distances .",
    "he quantified the turbulent fraction and concluded that a state of fully turbulent flow would be always reached above the critical reynolds number @xmath5 , which he speculated to be about @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "wygnanski and coworkers later recongized the intermittent nature of turbulence in the transitional regime and concluded that a fully turbulent flow would be realized at about @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the increase in computing power has made it possible to numerically simulate intermittent flows in spatially extended domains @xcite .",
    "one advantage of simulations is that due to periodic boundary conditions in the axial direction the dynamics of turbulent patches can be studied for very long times , whereas in experiments they are convected out . using simulations in pipes of up to @xmath8 diameters in length , moxey and barkley @xcite argue that no laminar islands are found in turbulent flow beyond @xmath9 .",
    "however , results from a model of pipe flow , allowing for very long domains and observation times , suggest that neither the transition to fully turbulent flow nor the transition from puffs to slugs is sharp @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that laminar - turbulence intermittency is an intrinsic feature of shear flow .",
    "as the reynolds number increases laminar regions become scarcer yet they do not disappear entirely .",
    "the underlying physical process has its roots in a nearest neighbor interaction between turbulent regions .",
    "a clear constraint of all previous investigations is the limited observation times and pipe length accessible to numerical simulation and laboratory experiment . in order to estimate the dynamical behavior of pipe flow in the limit of infinite length and time",
    ", we performed numerical simulations of periodic pipes of up to @xmath10 diameters in length and considered observation times of up to @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the pipe diameter and @xmath2 the mean speed ; the reynolds number is @xmath13 ) . the navier  stokes equations were solved in cylindrical coordinates @xmath14 using the hybrid spectral finite - difference method of willis @xcite .",
    "the numerical discretization consists of a non - equispaced @xmath15-point finite - difference stencil in @xmath16 and of fourier modes in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the results for @xmath19 have been obtained with up to @xmath20 radial points and @xmath21 azimuthal fourier modes , whereas @xmath22 axial fourier modes have been used for a pipe length of @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 we used @xmath20 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the spreading of turbulence along the pipe was systematically studied by using the following procedure .",
    "first , a puff was generated at low reynolds number , e.g.  @xmath27 , from a localized perturbation .",
    "subsequently , the reynolds number was impulsively changed to a prescribed value and the dynamics was monitored in time .",
    "figure  [ slug2600]@xmath28 shows a snapshot of streamwise vorticity in a @xmath29 plane at @xmath30 after the reynolds number was increased to @xmath31 .",
    "although initially the localized puff appears to spread continuously , as a slug , it later splits into two smaller turbulent structures , the first one resembling a slug and the second one a puff . between them",
    "the cross - sectionally averaged streamwise vorticity @xmath32 ( red curve in fig .",
    "[ slug2600]@xmath33 ) rapidly approaches zero , whereas the streamwise velocity at the centerline ( blue curve ) slowly increases towards the laminar value @xmath34 , but does not quite reach it .",
    "our simulations confirm previous experimental observations , which identified mixed occurrences of puffs and slugs originating from single localized perturbations @xcite , and suggest that the coexistence of localized and expanding structures ( i.e.  puffs and slugs ) is intrinsic to pipe flow .",
    "in order to study the asymptotic behavior of the system simulations started from a localized disturbance were continued until the entire domain was filled with spatio - temporal - intermittency .",
    "the flow dynamics thereafter is shown in figure  [ sizes]@xmath28 , which is a space - time diagram of @xmath35 at @xmath36 . at a given instant in time",
    "@xmath37 , an @xmath18-constant cross section was considered laminar if @xmath38 .",
    "we note that our threshold choice yields a puff size of @xmath39 at @xmath27 , which is consistent with results from previous experimental studies considering the active part of the puff @xcite .",
    "note that when streamwise velocity or pressure are considered , the length of a puff is typically much longer due to the slow recovery of the parabolic profile in the downstream direction ( fig .",

    "scales considered here ) spreading events ( puff - splitting ) are very rare . in the absence of these events",
    "the length distributions are gaussian - like about the average puff length . at higher reynolds number",

    "[ sizes]@xmath33 show turbulent length distributions in the range @xmath46 $ ] . as the reynolds number increases ,",
    "turbulent patches become increasinlgy longer because relaminarization of pipe sections becomes more infrequent .",
    "the same analysis applied to the laminar gaps between turbulent sections renders exponential distributions as well ( fig .",
    "[ sizes]@xmath47 ) . here",
    "also distributions are exponential only for laminar gaps longer than the typical interaction length at which puffs strongly influence each other @xcite . at @xmath48",
    "this interaction length is about @xmath49 , whereas it rapidly decreases as @xmath50 increases ( at @xmath7 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "we note that exponential distributions of the size of chaotic and laminar clusters are a typical signature of spatio - temporal - intermittency and were previously reported in simulations of coupled map lattices @xcite , convection in an annulus @xcite , in the taylor - dean system @xcite and torsional couette flow @xcite .",
    "although the distribution of laminar lengths is expected to be scale invariant ( algebraic ) at the onset of sustained spatio - temporal - intermittency ( @xmath52 in pipe flow ) , the relevant physical decay and spreading processes occur at a time scale @xmath53 @xcite , clearly out of reach in the simulations .",
    "using very long simulations of a reduced model of plane couette flow , manneville @xcite has demonstrated that laminar size distributions are algebraic at onset .",
    "more recently , scale invariance at the onset of turbulence has been shown from simualtions of the navier ",
    "stokes equations for couette flow in a tilted domain @xcite . in pipe flow ,",
    "reduced models that recover the main features of the transitional dynamics have been also proposed @xcite and might prove useful in addressing this point .",
    "here we checked that the laminar size distributions are indeed exponential for @xmath54 , whereas we found that for @xmath55 our simulations can not be used to quantiatively estimate the distributions . exploring",
    "this low @xmath56 regime remains a challenge and would require time - integrations and domains substantially beyond those used in this work .",

    "[ sizes]@xmath33 naturally define a characteristic turbulent length @xmath58 at each reynolds number .",
    "the variation of the scale parameter @xmath58 as a function of @xmath56 is shown in a logarithmic vertical axis in fig .",
    "[ meansize]@xmath28 .",
    "as @xmath56 increases @xmath58 grows strikingly fast ( fig .",
    "[ meansize]@xmath28 ) .",
    "the data are best approximated by a super - exponential fit of the shape @xmath59 $ ] and indicate , if extrapolated , that no divergence of turbulent lengths occurs at a finite .",
    "this result suggests that no continuously growing slugs exist , but rather these split into smaller slugs after perhaps a very long , but finite time .",
    "moreover , the fit approximates the data well into the puff regime and hence provides a quantitative link between localized and pipe - filling turbulent flow . in the case of laminar gaps",
    "it was found that the analogous scale parameter @xmath60 decreases algebraically with reynolds number ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ meansize]@xmath28 ) , also supporting that fully turbulent flow is reached only in the asympotic  limit .",
    "note that @xmath60 is not the average laminar gap length because it does not contain information about the part of the distribution which is not exponential .",
    "for example @xmath61 at @xmath62 but the average laminar gap length is @xmath63 .",
    "we verified that the length distributions are independent of initial conditions by starting simulations with turbulent flow at large reynolds number and quenching to the desired .",
    "these lead to the same size distributions as the simulations started from a single puff .",
    "secondly , we repeated the simulations for different pipe lengths . again convergence to the same distributions was achieved .",
    "overall , the results show that the asymptotic size distributions are independent of the pipe length and initial conditions , and so they are an intrinsic property of the system in the ` thermodynamic limit ' .",
    "although lengths ( durations ) of laminar and turbulent regions in pipe flow had been previously investigated in experiments @xcite , the observation times of @xmath64 where too short to reach size distributions which are in statistical equilibrium ( see especially fig .  26 of ref .  ) .",
    "hence , the lengths of the observed laminar episodes was likely controlled by the time - scale at which turbulence was spontaneously triggered by the disturbance ( obstacle ) at the inlet .",
    "r +    while a variation of the cut - off @xmath65 discriminating laminar from turbulent flow necessarily leads to a shift of absolute values , the qualitative scaling remains unchanged .",
    "regardless of the choice , the characteristic turbulent ( laminar ) size scale super - exponentially ( algebraically ) with .",
    "it was found that turbulent distributions are more sensitive to the threshold value than laminar ones , which remain almost unchanged .    the gradual transition from spatio - temporal - intermittency to fully turbulent flow",
    "is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ meansize]@xmath33 , showing the skin friction dependence on .",
    "in contrast to previous simulations @xcite we do not observe an overshoot of the blasius curve as this is approached .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to numerical resolution .",
    "it is noted that to accurately resolve friction values high numerical resolutions are required . here",
    "convergence was checked by independently increasing the resolution in all directions until the difference between computed frictions was below @xmath66 . beyond @xmath67",
    "the flow rapidly converges to the blasius friction law , whereas for @xmath55 it was not possible to reliably compute friction values due to the extremely slow time - scales at which puffs merge , split and annihilate each other to open laminar gaps @xcite .",
    "the development of a laminar island at @xmath68 is shown in fig .",
    "[ lamisland ] and illustrates the collapse of streamwise vortices in an extended part of the flow domain .",
    "a similar phenomenon was observed in minimal channels , where occasionally streamwise vortices weaken across the entire domain and turbulent activity temporarily ceases @xcite .",
    "our observation that laminar islands keep emerging in the flow as the reynolds number is increased supports that quiescent regions are intrinsic to turbulent shear flow in realistically long domains . unlike in couette flows , where laminar - turbulent patterns have been suggested to emerge as a wavelength instability of the fully turbulent flow @xcite , in pipe flow laminar domains are found to appear at random locations and times in the turbulent flow ( see fig .",
    "[ sizes]a ) .",
    "our results are in agreement with recent experiments in long pipes @xcite which found random spacing between puffs following reynolds number reductions from fully turbulent flow .",
    "the essence of this process is captured by excitable and bistable media models @xcite : the emergence of a laminar gap depends here only on the state of turbulence in the nearby region .",
    "the results presented here can be used to test and calaibrate models of pipe flow that have been recently developed following different approaches @xcite .",
    "the exponential size distributions of laminar and turbulent lengths further suggest that laminar turbulent patterns in pipe flow are the manifestation of a contact process only asymptotically giving rise to fully turbulent flow .    .",
    "the time - snapshots are separated by @xmath69 in a frame co - moving at the mean - speed @xmath2 .",
    "here @xmath70 out of a domain of @xmath71 are shown . ]",
    "the traditional view of equilibrium puffs giving way to a regime of puff splitting and eventually to one of expanding slugs @xcite has originated from observations over time - scales typically accessible in laboratory experiments . while over these timescales",
    "this picture appears to reflect the sequence of events , it nevertheless obscures some of the most relevant physics .",
    "only the observation of a large number of events in extended domains and over long times reveals that a uniform state of turbulence ( or fully turbulent flow ) does not exist .",
    "instead strong spatio - temporal fluctuations are intrinsic to the flow including the extreme case where turbulence collapses in some part of the domain .",
    "as we have pointed out elsewhere @xcite , localized turbulent patches are also never in equilibrium , i.e.  they either grow or decay , and an equilibrium puff regime does not exist either .    in conclusion ,",
    "only one state of turbulence exists which is that of a spatio - temporally intermittent flow exhibiting large fluctuations . at low @xmath72 fluctuations manifest themselves in sequences of laminar and turbulent regions , whereas at @xmath73 laminar events become so scarce that turbulence flow will here appear as space filling but with large fluctuations of intensity in space and time providing the familiar turbulence intermittency still observed at reynolds numbers many orders of magnitude larger .",
