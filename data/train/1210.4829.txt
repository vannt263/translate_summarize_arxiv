    "random polynomials and random holomorphic functions are studied as ways to gain insight for problems arising in string theory and analytic number theory @xcite . in @xcite , kac studied and determined a formula for the expected distribution of zeros of some real gaussian random polynomials .",
    "his work was generalized to complex random polynomials and random analytic functions throughout the years , we refer to @xcite for more backgrounds and results .",
    "when the random polynomial is defined invariant with respect to some group action , the problem can turn out to be particularly interesting , we refer  2.3 in @xcite for examples . in this article",
    ", we will study a special family : the gaussian @xmath0 random polynomial .",
    "this is of particular interest in the physics literature as the zeros describe a random spin state for the  majorana   representation ( modulo phase ) on the unit sphere @xcite .",
    "given a probability space @xmath1 and @xmath2 a collection of i.i.d complex gaussian random variables with mean @xmath3 and variance @xmath4 on it , the family of @xmath0 random polynomials is defined as , @xmath5 although this polynomial is defined on @xmath6 , we may also view it as an analytic function on @xmath7 with a pole at @xmath8 .",
    "various properties of the zeros of random @xmath0 polynomials have been studied such as the distribution of zeros and the two points correlation function @xcite .",
    "first , zeros of this polynomials are uniformly distributed on @xmath9 with respect to the fubini - study metric , i.e. , the average distribution of zeros is invariant under the @xmath0 action on @xmath10 @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "let s denote @xmath11 as the empirical measure of zeros of gaussian @xmath0 random polynomials and define the pairing , @xmath12 we define the expectation , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the legesgue measure on @xmath6 .",
    "then the expected density of zeros is @xcite , @xmath15 in the sense that , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fubini - study metric on @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we can also study the two points correlation function of zeros of @xmath0 polynomials and its scaling property .",
    "we define the two points correlation function as @xcite , @xmath19 such that for any smooth test function @xmath20 , we have the pairing , @xmath21 if we scale the two points correlation function by a factor @xmath22 , then we have , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the geodesic distance of @xmath26 and @xmath27 on @xmath18 . it s easy to see , @xmath28 which implies zeros repel each other .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .      in this article , we will study the expected distribution of nonvanishing critical values of @xmath29 as @xmath30 large enough .",
    "note that the modulus @xmath29 is a subharmonic function , thus there is no local maxima ; local minima are all zeros and thus nonvanishing critical values are obtained only at saddle points @xcite . hence the expected density of nonvanishing critical values of @xmath29 we study in this article is in fact the expected density of values of saddle points of @xmath29 .",
    "the nonvanishing critical values of @xmath29 are obtained at points , @xmath31 for a random polynomial @xmath32 , it has no repeated zeros almost surely , which implies that the set ( [ set ] ) is almost surely equivalent to , @xmath33 i.e. , ( nonvanishing ) @xmath29 and @xmath32 have the same critical points almost surely .",
    "hence , we will first get the expected density of critical values of @xmath32 in theorem [ main ] , as a direct consequence , we can apply the polar coordinate to get the expected density of nonvanishing critical values of @xmath29 in theorem [ main2 ] .",
    "we denote the empirical measure of critical values of @xmath32 as , @xmath34 we now define the pairing , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the space of smooth functions on @xmath37 with compact support .",
    "we denote @xmath38 as the expected density of critical values of @xmath32 in the sense that , @xmath39 whereas @xmath40 is the  lebesgue   measure of @xmath6 .",
    "those definitions also apply to the empirical measure of the nonvanishing critical values of @xmath29 , @xmath41 which is a measure defined on the nonnegative real line @xmath42 .",
    "we define its expectation as , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the  lebesgue   measure on @xmath45 .    in this article , we will first get the exact formula for the expected density @xmath46 in the proposition [ dn ] by the kac - rice formula ( see section  [ kr ] ) , then we study the asymptotic behavior of @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "our main results are ,    [ main]the expected density @xmath46 of the empirical measure @xmath49 of the critical values of @xmath32 satisfies the estimate , @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "it seems that the growth @xmath47 is @xmath52 as @xmath53 is away from @xmath3 as @xmath48 , below is the computer graphic of this function with the variable @xmath54 ,        as proved in proposition [ dn ] , the density @xmath55 only depends on @xmath53 , i.e. , the modulus of @xmath29 , thus we can rewrite it as @xmath56 under the polar coordinate .",
    "if we integrate on @xmath57 variable , then @xmath58 will be the density of critical values of @xmath29 .",
    "thus as a direct consequence of theorem [ main ] , we get ,    [ main2]the expected density @xmath59 of the empirical measure @xmath60 of the nonvanishing critical values of @xmath29 satisfies the estimate , @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "the growth of @xmath59 is also of order @xmath63 as @xmath64 is large , but there is a peak when @xmath64 is small , the following is the computer graphic ,          first note that our setting is different from the one in @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite , critical points of @xmath0 polynomials are defined to be the points @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the smooth chern connection on the line bundle @xmath67 with respect to the  fubini  -study metric and @xmath32 is a global holomorphic section of the line bundle @xmath67 @xcite . by choosing such smooth chern connection , the expected distribution of critical points are also invariant under the @xmath0 action @xcite .",
    "but in this article , the critical points are defined by the usual derivative @xmath68 in fact , the derivative @xmath69 is a meromorphic flat chern connection on @xmath67 with a pole at @xmath8 . under this setting ,",
    "the expected density of critical points is not @xmath0 invariant , we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "our second remark is as following . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the expected density of nonvanishing critical values of the pointwise norm of gaussian random holomorphic sections of the positive holomorphic line bundle over compact khler manifolds .",
    "now let s briefly explain the main result in @xcite and compare it with theorem [ main2 ] .",
    "take gaussian @xmath0 random polynomials ( sections ) @xmath32 for example .",
    "we equip the line bundle @xmath67 with a hermitian metric @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the khler potential of fubini - study metric .",
    "then the pointwise @xmath72-norm of the holomorphic section @xmath73 is global defined on @xmath18 @xcite and hence the critical points of @xmath74 is defined as , @xmath75 we define the ( normalized ) empirical measure of critical value of @xmath74 as , @xmath76 which is also a measure defined on @xmath42 .",
    "then the expectation of @xmath77 satisfies the estimate , @xmath78 as @xmath30 large enough .",
    "in fact , this estimate is universal : it holds on any riemannian surfaces @xcite .",
    "thus the ( normalized ) density @xmath79 is exponent decaying as @xmath64 large enough which is quite different from the behavior of ( non - normalized ) density @xmath80 in theorem [ main2 ] .",
    "this is mainly because of the connection we choose : the usual derivative @xmath81 in this article is a meromorphic flat connection on @xmath18 with a pole at @xmath8 while in @xcite , the proof of ( [ timed ] ) relies on a choice of smooth chern connection @xmath82 .",
    "* acknowledgements * : the first named author would like to thank s. zelditch for suggesting this problem and many helpful discussions .",
    "in this section , we first review the kac - rice formula for a stochastic process , referring to @xcite for more details .",
    "then we generalize the formula to the expected distribution of critical values of @xmath32 .",
    "the kac - rice formula is as follows : let @xmath83 be a real valued stochastic process indexed by a compact interval @xmath84 .",
    "then the kac - rice formula for the expected number of zeros is , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the joint density @xmath87 of @xmath88 evaluated at @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath90 is a gaussian process , then the joint density @xmath87 is determined by the covariance matrix of @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the proof of this formula is explained in more details in @xcite .",
    "the idea of the proof is based on the following observation , @xmath92 we take expectation on both sides to get , @xmath93 thus the expected density of zeros of @xmath90 is given by , @xmath94 if @xmath83 is a complex stochastic process indexed by a compact complex domain , then the above formula reads , @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are lebesgue measures on @xmath6 . compared with ( [ realcase ] ) , we get @xmath98 since a @xmath4-dimensional complex random process is a @xmath99-dimensional real random process . in fact , this formula is based on the definition of the delta function , @xmath100 the formula arises when we take expectation on both sides .      in this subsection ,",
    "let s get the formula for the expected density of critical values of a ( real or complex ) stochastic process @xmath90 by the method of kac - rice .    for simplicity ,",
    "let s first consider a smooth real stochastic process @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a compact subset in @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath103 be a compact subset .",
    "let s denote the set of critical values in @xmath104 as , @xmath105 let s denote the measure @xmath106 on @xmath104 as , @xmath107 in the sense that , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is any smooth test function defined on @xmath104 .",
    "then we have the following lemma ,    [ easycase]let s denote @xmath110 as the joint probability of @xmath111 . then , @xmath112 where @xmath44 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are  lebesgue   measures on @xmath45 .    first note",
    "that , @xmath115 by taking expectation on both sides , @xmath116    in the proof of lemma [ easycase ] , we have assumed @xmath102 and @xmath104 being compact subsets in @xmath45 .",
    "but the proof of lemma [ easycase ] can be generalized to the @xmath0 random polynomials @xmath32 which are a collection of complex gaussian stochastic processes indexed by @xmath6 .",
    "the generalization of @xmath104 to be @xmath6 only requires picking up a sequence of discs centered at the origin with radius @xmath117 and taking limit in weak sense . and",
    "the generalization from @xmath102 to @xmath6 is the same .",
    "however , we do need to modify the pairing by choosing the test functions @xmath118 in the smooth compact supported space @xmath119 in order to change the order of the integration on @xmath6 .",
    "following the proof of lemma [ easycase ] , we have ,    [ complexcase ] the expected density of critical values of @xmath32 is , @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath97 are lebesgue measures on @xmath6 and @xmath122 is the joint density of @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the covariance matrix of @xmath123 .",
    "the proof of this formula is the same as the one in lemma [ easycase ] .",
    "note that we get @xmath125 in the formula since @xmath32 is a 1-dimensional complex gaussian process which is a 2-dimensional real process .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 is a gaussian process , hence the joint density @xmath110 is uniquely determined by the covariance matrix of @xmath123 , we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "by definition , the covariance matrix of the gaussian process @xmath123 is given by @xcite , @xmath127 the covariance kernel for the gaussian process @xmath32 is , @xmath128 then we can express each entry in the covariance matrix as , @xmath129      @xmath131 some straight forward computations show that the covariance matrix is , @xmath132 hence , @xmath133 now we denote , @xmath134 then by direct computations , we rewrite , @xmath135 we expand this expression and further rewrite @xmath136 as , @xmath137      let s integrate @xmath139 variable first . plug ( [ vv ] ) into ( [ ddddd ] ) , we can rewrite ( [ ddddd ] ) as , @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the following integral in @xmath139 variable , @xmath142 change variables @xmath143 to get , @xmath144 further change variable , @xmath145 to get , @xmath146 which equals to@xmath147 integrate it out , we have , @xmath148.\\ ] ] now we change variable @xmath149 , rewrite @xmath150\\ ] ] and @xmath151 plug these two lines back into the formula of ( [ ttt ] ) and use the polar coordinate @xmath152 , integrate on @xmath57 variable , we can rewrite @xmath47 as ,      there are two parts in the numerator , we use integration by part to simplify the first part .",
    "note that @xmath154dr,\\ ] ] then the first part is equal to , @xmath155e^{-\\frac{n(r-1)+1}{r^n}|x|^2}dr\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence the density ( [ ttttt ] ) is further simplified to be , @xmath156 which completes the proof .",
    "the trick to estimate @xmath47 is to calculate @xmath167 by integration by part , we have , @xmath168 where we denote @xmath169 thus , @xmath170 we claim @xmath171 this is quite straight forward , as @xmath172 , we rewrite , @xmath173 since @xmath174 uniformly on @xmath175 $ ] as @xmath176 , thus @xmath177 for the second integration , since @xmath178 on @xmath179 $ ] , we have @xmath180 hence we get @xmath181 as @xmath182 is chosen arbitrarily , letting @xmath183 yields the claim .",
