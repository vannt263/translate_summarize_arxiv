    "multiferroic materials exhibit ferroelectric ( or antiferroelectric ) properties in combination with ferromagnetic ( or antiferromagnetic ) properties in the same phase and have attracted considerable research interest due to their potential applications in multiple state memory elements , magnetic - field sensor and electric field controlled ferromagnetic resonance devices @xcite . amongst the multiferroic ceramics being widely investigated , bifeo@xmath0 is a promising candidate for novel applications which allow mutual control of the electric polarization with a magnetic field and magnetization by an electric field @xcite .",
    "bifeo@xmath0 is ferroelectric below t@xmath10 @xmath6 1103 k and antiferromagnetic below t@xmath11 @xmath6 653 k , having rhombohedrally distorted perovskite abo@xmath0 ( a = bi , b= fe ) structure @xcite .",
    "previous investigations revealed that pure phase of bifeo@xmath0 is difficult to obtain @xcite and various impurity phases of bulk bifeo@xmath0 have been reported , mainly comprising of bi@xmath12fe@xmath13o@xmath14 , bi@xmath15fe@xmath16o@xmath17 and bi@xmath18feo@xmath19 @xcite .    in bifeo@xmath0 ,",
    "magnetic ordering is of antiferromagnetic type , having a spiral modulated spin structure ( smss ) with an incommensurate long - wavelength period of 62 nm @xcite .",
    "this spiral spin structure cancels the macroscopic magnetization and prevents the observation of the linear magnetoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "in addition , the bulk bifeo@xmath0 is characterized by serious current leakage problems due to the existence of a large number of charge centres caused by oxygen ion vacancies @xcite .",
    "these problems limit the use of bifeo@xmath0 for fabrication of multifunctional devices @xcite . in order to overcome these problems ,",
    "many attempts have been undertaken @xcite .",
    "amongst which the partial substitution of bi@xmath20 by ions such as sm@xmath20 @xcite , nd@xmath20 @xcite etc and also substitution of fe@xmath20 by ions such as cr@xmath20 @xcite , or simultaneous minor substitution of bi@xmath20 and fe@xmath20 by ions such as la@xmath20 and mn@xmath20 or la@xmath20 and ti@xmath21 , respectively @xcite improved the magnetism and ferroelectricity in bifeo@xmath0 .",
    "the partial substitution of bi@xmath20 with ions having the biggest ionic radius has been found to effectively suppress the spiral spin structure of bifeo@xmath0 giving rise to the appearance of weak ferromagnetism @xcite .    among various kind of doping at a site",
    ", it was observed that the substitution of 10 @xmath9 gd in place of bi enhanced the room temperature magnetization of bifeo@xmath0 @xcite as well as improved the phase purity of bulk bifeo@xmath0 . at b site",
    ", the partial substitution of fe by ti is found specially attractive as the substitution of ti@xmath21 decreased the leakage current significantly and induced a remanent magnetization in bifeo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is observed that at 200 k due to the substitution of fe by ti in bife@xmath22ti@xmath23o@xmath0 , the area of the magnetization versus magnetic field ( m - h ) curve increased compared to that of pure bifeo@xmath0 .",
    "however , at room temperature the m - h loop was still very narrow @xcite which indicates that substitution of 25 @xmath9 ti in place of fe can not improve notably the magnetic properties at room temperature ( rt ) .",
    "therefore , in the present investigation , we intend to study the effect of co - substitution of magnetic gd and non - magnetic ti in place of bi and fe , respectively , in bifeo@xmath0 samples .",
    "so far there are reports on the co - doping effect of la@xmath20 and ti@xmath21 @xcite , la@xmath20 and mn@xmath20 @xcite , la@xmath20 and v@xmath24 @xcite , respectively in place of bi and fe in bifeo@xmath0 . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there is no published data on dielectric and magnetic properties of gd and ti co - doped bifeo@xmath0 samples measured at rt .",
    "therefore , nominal compositions of bi@xmath1gd@xmath2fe@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath0 ( x = 0.00 - 0.25 ) ceramics were synthesized by conventional solid state reaction technique and their structure , morphology , dielectric and magnetic properties were investigated .",
    "we observed that due to the combined effects of gd and ti , dielectric and magnetic properties of these ceramics were improved at rt .",
    "moreover , an asymmetry exhibiting shifts both in the field and magnetization axes of m - h curves was also observed in gd and ti co - doped ceramics which indicates the presence of exchange bias ( eb ) effect in these compounds at rt .",
    "the polycrystalline samples having compositions bi@xmath1gd@xmath2fe@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath0 ( x = 0.00 - 0.25 ) were synthesized by using standard solid state reaction technique .",
    "the high purity oxides of bi@xmath25o@xmath26 , gd@xmath25o@xmath26 , fe@xmath25o@xmath26 , and tio@xmath25 powders were carefully weighed in stoichiometric proportion , mixed thoroughly with acetone and grounded in an agate mortar until a homogeneous mixture was formed .",
    "the compacted mixtures of reagents taken in desired cation ratios were calcined at 800@xmath27c for 1.5 hours in a programmable furnace .",
    "the calcined powders were grounded again for 2 hours to get more homogeneous mixture .",
    "the powders were pressed into pellets of thickness 1 mm and diameter 12 mm by using a uniaxial hydraulic press and sintered at 825@xmath27c for 5 hours at heating rate 10@xmath27c per minute .",
    "the crystal structure of the samples ( sintered powder ) was determined from x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) data .",
    "xrd patterns were collected at rt using a diffractometer ( rigaku ultimate vii ) with cuk@xmath28 ( @xmath29 = 1.5418 @xmath30 ) radiation .",
    "the microstructure of the surface of pellets was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope ( fesem , jeol , jsm 5800 ) equipped with the energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) .",
    "the edx analysis has been used to determine the overall chemical homogeneity and composition of the samples .",
    "the dielectric properties were measured at rt using an impedance analyzer ( agilent 4294 a ) in the frequency range 100 hz-20 mhz .",
    "the magnetic properties of the samples were characterized by using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm , lakeshore 7407 series ) with a sensitivity of 10@xmath31 emu at rt .",

    "there are small traces of secondary phase bi@xmath12fe@xmath13o@xmath14 as labeled by @xmath32 still appear both in the undoped and doped samples .",
    "the apparently unavoidable formation of secondary phases during the solid - state synthesis of bifeo@xmath0 based materials have been reported in several articles @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of secondary phases do not affect ferroelectric and magnetic properties of the samples because these phases are neither magnetic nor ferroelectric at rt @xcite .",
    "the decrease in the peak intensities for x = 0.05 - 0.25 indicates the incorporation of ti in bi@xmath1gd@xmath2fe@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath0 ceramics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the twin peaks observed around 2@xmath33 @xmath34 40@xmath27 , 52@xmath27 and 57@xmath27 merges to form a broadened peak @xcite also confirms the substitution of ti in these compounds .",
    "splitting of peak around 2@xmath33 @xmath34 32@xmath27 as ti content increases to x = 0.25 suggests a structure change from rhombohedral to orthorhombic @xcite and is consistent with that of reported articles @xcite .",

    "notably , in the nominal compositions of bi@xmath1gd@xmath2fe@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath0 ceramics , it is expected that titanium is in its tetravalent state and the non magnetic ti@xmath21 substitutes fe@xmath20 .",

    "[ fig2](c )",
    ". the further increase of the ti content to 10 @xmath9 ( x = 0.10 ) reduced the average grain size to @xmath6 200 @xmath8 as well as made the distribution of the grains homogeneous ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "notably , increase of the ti content from x = 0.10 to x = 0.15 or 0.20 does not reduce anymore the average grain size from @xmath6 200 @xmath8 .",
    "due to the substitution of ti , the average grain size was reduced and the peak in the xrd pattern of the ti substituted sample was widened as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    however , for 25 @xmath9 ti doping , the average grain size remain unchanged , that is @xmath36 200 @xmath8 but some of the grains grow to larger sizes ( ( @xmath61 @xmath7 ) ( fig . [",
    "fig2](c ) ) .",
    "previous investigation suggested that the grain growth depends upon the concentration of oxygen vacancies @xcite and diffusion rate of the ions .",
    "large number of oxygen vacancies are generate in pure bifeo@xmath0 due to highly volatile nature of bi .",
    "an increment of the ti doping concentration in bi@xmath1gd@xmath2fe@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath0 decreased the average grain size significantly due to the fact that ti possesses a higher valence than fe and suppresses the formation of oxygen vacancies .",
    "therefore , the significant reduction of the average grain size in gd and ti co - doped bifeo@xmath0 samples could be interpreted by the suppression of the formation of oxygen vacancies because of the requirements of the charge compensation .",
    "the decreased oxygen vacancies lead to a lower grain growth rate which is actually a consequence of slower oxygen ion motion @xcite . to ascertain the level of doping in these samples , edx analysis was done on all of them .",

    "<S> room temperature dielectric and magnetic properties of bifeo@xmath0 samples , co - doped with magnetic gd and non - magnetic ti in place of bi and fe , respectively , were reported . </S>",
    "<S> the nominal compositions of bi@xmath1gd@xmath2fe@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath0 ( x = 0.00 - 0.25 ) ceramics were synthesized by conventional solid state reaction technique . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction patterns revealed that the substitution of fe by ti induces a phase transition from rhombohedral to orthorhombic at x @xmath5 0.20 . </S>",
    "<S> morphological studies demonstrated that the average grain size was reduced from @xmath61.5 @xmath7 to @xmath6200 @xmath8 with the increase in ti content . </S>",
    "<S> due to ti substitution , the dielectric constant was stable over a wide range of high frequencies ( 30 khz to 20 mhz ) by suppressing the dispersion at low frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric properties of the compounds are associated with their improved morphologies and reduced leakage current densities probably due to the lower concentration of oxygen vacancies in the compositions . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic properties of bi@xmath1gd@xmath2fe@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath0 ( x = 0.00 - 0.25 ) ceramics measured at room temperature were enhanced with ti substitution up to 20 @xmath9 compared to that of pure bifeo@xmath0 and ti undoped bi@xmath1gd@xmath2feo@xmath0 samples . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced magnetic properties might be attributed to the substitution induced suppression of spiral spin structure of bifeo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> an asymmetric shifts both in the field and magnetization axes of magnetization versus magnetic field ( m - h ) curves was observed . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the presence of exchange bias effect in these compounds notably at room temperature . </S>"
