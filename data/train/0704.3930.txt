    "in the katrin experiment the absolute neutrino mass is determined by the measurement of the integral energy spectrum of the electrons coming from beta decay of tritium molecules .",
    "the electrons are guided from the tritium source to the detector by magnetic field . between the source and the detector a large negative potential ( -18.6 kv )",
    "is applied at the main spectrometer , with the aim that only those electrons can reach the detector that have a decay kinetic energy above the value corresponding to this potential .",
    "the transversal energy component ( relative to magnetic field ) of the electrons is converted into longitudinal energy by using the inverse magnetic mirror effect .",
    "thus it is possible to measure the integral electron energy spectrum simultanously with high statistics and with high precision . for further information about the katrin experiment",
    "@xcite .",
    "the differential electron energy spectrum can be written ( in a first approximation , close to the endpoint ) as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the relativistic total electron energy , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the neutrino energy and mass , and @xmath4 is the nominal endpoint ( maximum of @xmath1 , if the neutrino mass is zero ) .",
    "there are several theoretical modifications to this simplified spectrum , the most important of them is due to the recoil molecular ion final state distribution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent calculation ) .",
    "degenerate neutrino masses are assumed ( the katrin experiment is able to find a non - zero neutrino mass only above 0.2 ev ) .",
    "the katrin experiment measures the integral energy spectrum , therefore one has to multiply the differential spectrum by the response function of the spectrometer ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , and to integrate from the minimal electron energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the electric potential in the middle of the main spectrometer ( analyzing plane ) and in the tritium source , respectively . the expected absolute detection rate of the katrin experiment can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for different neutrino mass and endpoint values .",
    "the most sensitive region for the neutrino mass determination is around @xmath8 ev , where the signal is twice as large as the background ( ref .",
    "it is clear from the figure that there is a positive correlation between the neutrino mass and the endpoint : a larger fixed endpoint value results in a larger fitted neutrino mass value .    in the katrin experiment ( like in several earlier neutrino mass experiments )",
    "the endpoint is a free parameter , to be determined from the katrin spectrum data .",
    "nevertheless , let us assume for a moment that the endpoint is a fixed input parameter .",
    "then a @xmath9 error of the endpoint results in a @xmath10 error for the neutrino mass squared ( using the last 20 ev of the spectrum for the data analysis ) . from the triton - he3 nuclear mass differences one has at present a @xmath11 ev error for the endpoint @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to determine the absolute potential values with a precision better than 100 mv . on the other hand , the katrin experiment aims to measure the neutrino mass squared with an accuracy of @xmath12 . to obtain this precision , the accuracy of the endpoint value ( as fixed parameter )",
    "should be at least 4 mev .",
    "therefore , it is obvious : * for the data analysis of the katrin experiment the endpoint can not be used as an external fixed input parameter ; it should be used necessarily as a free parameter , determined from the katrin data .",
    "analyses assuming the endpoint as a fixed parameter are not relevant for the katrin experiment . *",
    "in the presence of right - handed weak couplings the differential electron spectrum is changed to the following form : @xmath13 this formula is valid close to the endpoint .",
    "a similar change of the electron spectrum is due to the fierz parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is a linear combination of the right - handed vector ( @xmath16 ) , axial - vector ( @xmath17 ) , scalar ( @xmath18 ) and tensor ( @xmath19)couplings : @xmath20 ( only the dominant terms are shown in this formula , which is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the left - handed @xmath21 and right - handed @xmath22 couplings have the following simple relations with the widely used couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 introduced by lee and yang in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath25 , @xmath26 . as it is explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are several advantages using the couplings @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the standard model only the left - handed vector and axial - vector couplings @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are non - zero .",
    "there are many experimental observables ( like beta asymmetry , neutrino - electron correlation , beta polarization etc . ) that provide constraints for the couplings @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , these observables are quadratic in the @xmath22 couplings ( with zero neutrino mass the right - handed couplings have no interference with the dominant left - handed couplings ) , therefore the 95 % confidence limits are not too small : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 ( see the recent overview in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the @xmath33 normalization is used here ) .",
    "the signs of the couplings @xmath22 are not known ; in order to obtain a conservative limit for @xmath15 we assume that these signs are equal ( in this case there is no sign cancellation in eq .",
    "[ bprimed ] ) . then we get the following limits : @xmath34 right - handed couplings and neutrino mass determination in katrin ----------------------------------------------------------------    let us assume that the real value of the parameter @xmath15 is nonzero , and the katrin data are analyzed with @xmath35 theory ( standard model ) . in this case , the fitted neutrino mass value should deviate from the real mass value .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the @xmath36 relative deviation due to the unaccounted right - handed parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the katrin design parameters and the statistical method described in ref .",
    "@xcite have been used for this calculation .",
    "the fitted parameter in these calculations is the neutrino mass squared , not the mass .",
    "one has to emphasize also that the endpoint was taken as a free parameter . according to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] * the relative change of the neutrino mass due to the unaccounted right - handed couplings is of order of 5 - 10 % . * for small neutrino mass values ( below 0.5 ev ) the shift @xmath38 is smaller than the expected experimental error of the mass , for larger mass values ( above 0.5 ev ) the shift of the mass is larger than the experimental error .",
    "taking the endpoint as a fixed input parameter , the results are completely different . to illustrate this difference ,",
    "let us consider a special numerical example : we assume that the real neutrino mass is @xmath39=0.35 ev , and the real value of the parameter @xmath15 is @xmath40 .",
    "then we make a computer experiment : we generate the katrin data by using these real values , but we analyze the data assuming @xmath35 .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the fitted neutrino mass values of these calculations with fixed and with free endpoint . * with free endpoint the fitted mass values are close to the real mass . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of fixed endpoint the fitted neutrino mass with @xmath41 is completely different from the real mass value . in the case of @xmath42",
    "the fitted mass squared becomes negative , in spite of the positive real mass value . using the endpoint as a free parameter such a large deviation between real and fitted mass or mass squared values",
