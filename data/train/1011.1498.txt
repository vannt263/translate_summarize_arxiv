    "many recent models of galaxy formation assume that galaxy properties are determined by the haloes in which they form and not by the surrounding larger - scale environment ( e.g. kauffmann et al .",
    "1997 ; berlind et al .",
    "2003 ; yang et al . 2003 ; baugh et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this picture ,",
    "the galaxy population in a halo of a given mass is independent of where the halo is located .",
    "this is justified by the standard description of structure formation , namely the extended press - schechter theory ( eps , bond et al .",
    "1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; mo & white 1996 ) , which was in turn based on both linear growth theory of density perturbations of an initial gaussian random fluctuation field @xcite and the non - linear spherical collapse model .",
    "furthermore , simulation results as recent as percival et al .",
    "( 2003 ) indicated that the halo clustering should only depend on the mass .",
    "however , a few years ago , it was shown that galaxy properties such as the star formation rate ( gomez et al .",
    "2003 ; balogh et al . 2004",
    "; ceccarelli et al . 2008 ; and padilla , lambas , gonzalez 2010 in observations ; gonzalez & padilla 2009 in numerical simulations ) and colours @xcite depend on the large - scale structure .",
    "gomez et al . ( 2003 ) found that , for a sample of galaxies in groups and clusters from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the star formation rate decreases , compared with the field population , starting at @xmath7 4 virial radii toward the cluster centre .",
    "gonzalez & padilla ( 2009 ) used a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation and found that the fraction of red galaxies diminishes for galaxies farther away from clusters ( or closer to voids ) in environments with the same local density .",
    "these results support the view that galaxy populations also depend on the larger - scale environment , both in models and observations .    regarding the fact that haloes of the same mass should essentially exhibit the same properties , gao et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter g05 ) measured that the large - scale clustering of haloes of a given mass depends strongly on the formation time , for halo masses m @xmath8 6@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath11 m@xmath12 .",
    "this study , based on @xmath13-body simulations , showed that haloes assembled at high redshift are more strongly correlated than those of the same mass that assembled recently .",
    "this effect , which is not expected from the excursion set theory , was termed `` assembly bias , '' which consists in that the large - scale clustering of haloes of a given mass varies significantly with their assembly history @xcite .    on the observational side of the assembly bias , wang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that groups selected from the sdss with red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than groups of the same mass but with blue centrals , being this effect much more important for less massive groups .",
    "in addition to the clustering amplitude , zapata et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that galaxy groups of similar mass and different assembly histories show differences in their galaxy population , for example in the fraction of red galaxies .",
    "furthermore , cooper et al . (",
    "2010 ) studied the relationship between the local environment and properties of galaxies in the red sequence . after removing the dependence of the average overdensity on colour and stellar mass",
    ", they still found a strong dependence on the luminosity - weighted stellar age .",
    "galaxies with older stellar populations occupy regions of higher overdensities compared to younger galaxies of similar colours or stellar masses .",
    "the latter results show that the concept of assembly bias could be applicable to galaxies in addition to dark matter haloes , and would then affect the physics of galaxy formation .    other halo properties such as concentration , number of subhaloes , subhalo mass function , shape , halo spin , major merger rate , triaxiality , shape of the velocity ellipsoid , and velocity anisotropy at a given mass show an assembly - type bias effect in cosmological @xmath13-body simulations @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this assembly bias are not yet fully understood .",
    "eps assumes no such environmental dependence . at a fixed mass , the markovian nature of the random walk trajectories of perturbations smoothed at higher resolution , which characterise a halo ,",
    "is assumed to be independent of the environment encoded in random walks at lower resolution .",
    "thus , halo properties should not be related with the external environment in haloes of equal mass .",
    "these random walks are obtained using a top - hat fourier - space window function to smooth ( or to average ) the density fluctuations ; this filter in @xmath14-space allows to obtain an analytic expression of the halo mass function that is equal to the press - schechter formula .",
    "there have been attempts to modify this window function to consider an environmental dependence .",
    "zentner ( 2007 ) combined a gaussian window function and a variable height of the barrier for collapsed objects , but found an opposite trend for the assembly bias at low masses .",
    "furthermore , correlations between halo parameters do not simply show the same clustering behaviour .",
    "bett et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that both the most nearly spherical haloes and those with highest spins are more strongly clustered than the average .",
    "however , this fact contradicts the correlation between spin and shape , where more spherical haloes have on average a slightly lower spin parameter . also , for example , the work by croton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that there are aspects of the assembly history which are not encoded in halo concentration or formation redshift and which correlate with the large - scale environment .",
    "one possible explanation was suggested by dalal et al .",
    "they claim that the halo assembly bias is related to the peak curvature of gaussian random fields in high - mass haloes , whereas at the low - mass regime the bias arises from a subpopulation of low - mass haloes whose mass accretion has ceased .",
    "these haloes could have been ejected out of nearby massive haloes ( ludlow et al .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that these ejected low - mass subhaloes have earlier assembly times and a much higher bias parameter than normal ( not ejected ) haloes of the same mass , so that they contribute to the assembly bias .",
    "however , they also found that the assembly bias is not dominated by this population , indicating that effects of the large - scale environment on `` normal '' haloes is the main source for this bias .    despite the fact that halo mass continues to be the most important parameter to determine the galaxy properties , it is relevant to study the assembly bias to gain further insights on the development of the large - scale structure",
    ". this is particularly significant when galaxies are used to constrain cosmological parameters , as shown by wu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in their study of the effects of halo assembly bias on galaxy cluster surveys .",
    "they used the halo concentration to find that upcoming photometric projects such as the dark energy survey ( des ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) can infer significantly biased cosmological parameters from the observed clustering amplitude of galaxy clusters if the assembly bias is not taken into account .",
    "hester & tasitsiomi ( 2010 , hereafter ht10 ) found an assembly - type bias in that the rate of major mergers of haloes of a given mass changes with the local environment .",
    "they proposed a dynamical explanation for this effect , particularly for high densities , based on both tidal stripping , responsible for the decrease in the major merger rate of galaxy - like haloes , and interactions between bound haloes in the outskirts of groups , which are related with the increase in the merger rate in group - like haloes .",
    "this plausible explanation applies on scales of out to @xmath7 250 kpc .",
    "we suggest that , if the initial peak did not collapse completely onto haloes , their mass will not be an appropriate proxy for the peak height",
    ". they will present old ages , which would not be the case if the peak finished its collapse onto the halo ( it would look younger dynamically ) .",
    "therefore , the scale out to which we need to extend the inclusion of mass for the peaks could be as large as or even larger than the scale proposed by ht10 since , at low @xmath15 , the initial overdensity may be still spread in larger areas around the current collapsed halo .",
    "wang et al . ( 2007 ) mention a similar idea in that old , low - mass haloes were part of higher peaks in the initial density field than what is revealed by their present - day virial mass . by means of a semi - analytic model",
    ", we will show that , at the present time , the assembly bias may well be related with the infall region of a halo for scales a range where the one - halo clustering amplitude between populations of the same mass but different ages differs strongly ( see section [ section_two - point ] ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to understand the origin of the assembly bias and its role in the development of the large - scale structure and on the galaxy population , beyond the halo mass dependence . in order to reach this goal",
    ", we will study this effect on the semi - analytic galaxies of the lagos , cora , @xmath16 padilla ( 2008 ) model .",
    "this will allow us to compare our results with those obtained from observational data in future work , so as to provide another test for the @xmath17cdm model of the universe .",
    "also , we will show that it is fundamental to include the global effect from large scales on the peak height estimate .",
    "the results obtained with this proxy of the peak height will be compared with those obtained from the virial mass of host haloes by means of the spatial two - point correlation function and infall velocity profiles for galaxy samples of different relative ages .",
    "this new definition of an overdensity peak height will not be subject to the assembly bias seen at large separations , thus objects of the same mass but different ages will show essentially the same clustering in the two - halo regime . given that the assembly bias has also been detected separating samples according to several other parameters than the halo age , in subsequent papers we will also investigate its prevalence when studying galaxies and haloes of different concentrations , number of satellites , sphericity , and whether our proposed explanation for the assembly bias also responds when using observational data .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec_data ]",
    ", we introduce our simulation .",
    "we then perform the statistics of density fields for the simulation in section [ section_statistics ] to compare our results with those from other authors that show the assembly bias effect .",
    "the redefinition of the overdensity peak height by using the two - point correlation function and the infall velocity profile is developed in section [ sec_redefinition_full ] .",
    "the nature of the objects that are being considered with this redefinition are shown in section [ sec_freq ] .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section [ conclusiones ] .",
    "the cosmology used here is @xmath18 = 1 , @xmath19 = 0.28 , @xmath20 = 0.72 , @xmath21 = 0.9 , @xmath22 = 0.72 , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "we use the sag2 model by lagos , cora , @xmath16 padilla ( 2008 ; see also lagos , padilla , & cora 2009 ) , which combines a cosmological @xmath13-body simulation of the concordance @xmath17cdm universe and a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation .",
    "the numerical simulation consists of a periodic box of 60 @xmath11 mpc on a side that contains 256@xmath23 dark matter particles with a mass resolution of @xmath7 10@xmath24 @xmath11 m@xmath12 .",
    "the galaxy population in the semi - analytic model is generated using the merger histories of dark matter haloes .",
    "one of the main features of this model is the implementation of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback , which reduces star formation by quenching the gas cooling process , an important effect on massive haloes at low redshifts .",
    "one of the most important parameters throughout this work is the age .",
    "we will use it to study the assembly bias effect for galaxies of a wide range of luminosities and , also , for dark matter haloes of a wide range in mass .    for galaxies",
    ", we will use the mass - weighted stellar age or , simply , stellar age defined as    @xmath25     + where @xmath26 is the age of the universe today , @xmath27 is the time corresponding to the i@xmath28 output of the simulation , and @xmath29 is the star formation rate calculated using the stellar mass @xmath30 accreted in a time step @xmath31 .",
    "we use this parameter , the stellar age , as it can be directly obtained from observational data @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the formation redshift of a dark matter ( dm ) halo is defined as the redshift when it assembled 50 per cent of its final mass at @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to mention that the assembly bias has been detected by using this definition of age for dm haloes , and thus it will be used in this work .",
    "there are other definitions that show a weaker or absent dependence of halo clustering on the halo formation time , as was shown by li et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .      to study the assembly bias , which consists in that old haloes have a higher clustering than young haloes of the same mass , it is not convenient to work directly with the stellar or halo formation age because they correlate with the mass .",
    "for example , massive dark matter haloes have , on average , older stellar populations ( figure [ mvir ] ) .",
    "= 8.9 cm    we need a definition of age which is independent of the mass .",
    "this is very important if we want to study galaxies in haloes of a wide range of masses .",
    "for example , age maps could show old objects in regions inhabited only by massive haloes .",
    "motivated by this problem , the first step is to find a proxy for a non - mass - dependent age . one way to do this consists in using ages relative to the median stellar age as a function of the host dm halo mass .",
    "we define the @xmath1 dimensionless parameter ,    @xmath33     + where , for the i@xmath28 galaxy , @xmath34 is its stellar age , @xmath35 is the median stellar age as a function of host halo mass ( red squares connected by the solid line in fig .",

    "[ mvir ] ) . in the case of dm haloes",

    "this definition implies that objects with positive ( negative ) values of @xmath1 lie above ( below ) the median stellar age or formation time for a population of a given mass .",
    "then , positive values of @xmath1 correspond to older objects , whereas negative values of @xmath1 are related to younger objects .",

    "in this section we present the two - point correlation function which allows us to calculate the clustering of haloes and galaxies , measured directly from the simulation and from theoretical expressions for the power spectrum .",
    "the correlation function , @xmath41 , is a useful quantitative measure of the spatial clustering .",

    "= 8.8 cm = 8.8 cm    in order to test whether our simulation is able to reproduce the observed signal of assembly bias at large scales found by other authors , figure [ comparacion ] shows the spatial cross - correlation function for haloes of different formation times and a given mass against the full population of haloes in the simulation , at @xmath15 = 0 ( top panels ) .",

    "= 5.8 cm = 5.8 cm = 5.8 cm    = 5.8 cm = 5.8 cm = 5.8 cm    as can be seen from the lowest - mass bin ( top left panel ) , the amplitude of clustering is higher for the old population than the young one , particularly for scales ( one - halo term ) .",
    "this could indicate that their density profiles are different , probably those of the young population being dynamically less internally evolved .",
    "the strong difference in clustering at distances beyond 1 @xmath11 mpc may imply that if the mass in the vicinities ( surrounding areas or the infall region ) of haloes were taken into account , it would show no dependence on age .",
    "in other words , as the virial mass of haloes is not good enough as an overdensity peak height estimator in the simple eps picture , this alternative could provide a better estimator for this peak height .",
    "ht10 detected an assembly - type bias for the dark matter halo major merger rate using the millennium simulation @xcite , and proposed a physical mechanism for this effect that , as was mentioned above , extends out to @xmath7 250 kpc .",
    "owing to the result seen in the top row of figure [ xi_bines_m ] , it is possible that to explain the assembly bias one would need to characterise the peak with mass on scales larger than the virial radius ( see section [ sec_redefinition_full ] ) , extending the local definition of peak from within a halo to larger scales usually regarded as part of the global environment .",
    "additionally , recent studies have suggested that a population of subhaloes that were expelled from larger haloes located beyond three times the virial radius of the main halo could explain the age dependence of the clustering in the low - mass regime @xcite .",
    "although wang et al . ( 2009 ) found that these low - mass haloes are not the main source for the assembly bias , they claim that environmental effects at large scales have a very important role on this issue . in this case",
    ", the mass of the expelled subhaloes are bad indicators of their peak height , which could be better represented by the higher mass of a larger halo .",
    "note that our results reproduce those found by previous authors where the dependence of the clustering on the assembly history is only detected in low - mass haloes .",
    "this indicates that the peak may include matter around haloes to distances that depend on both halo mass and age .",
    "the statistical properties of the density fluctuation field can be represented by its power spectrum @xmath66 , or equivalently by its dimensionless power spectrum @xmath67 , @xmath68 + which measures the power per logarithmic unit bin in wavenumber @xmath14 .",
    "this spectrum is a direct manifestation of the hierarchical growth of structures , where small - scale perturbations collapse first to grow and later form larger - scale perturbations which will collapse and form larger objects , in a non - linear process as time progresses .",
    "directly related to this evolution are the abundance and clustering of galaxy systems and their variations as a function of mass and redshift .",

    "we propose to extend the proxy for peak height to larger scales so that it does not show the assembly bias effect . the scale will include the mass of the peak which has already collapsed but also , in some cases , some of the mass that , due to global environmental effects , has not done so yet",

    "the left column shows the lower mass bin , whereas the most massive bin is shown in the right column . this peak height definition can not fully trace the assembly bias at large scales for each mass bin , although it does a better job than the virial mass",
    "therefore , a redefinition of halo mass including larger scales than the virial radius could recover the simple prescription where the bias responds to the height of the mass peak alone . to achieve this goal",
    ", it thus seems necessary to consider influences beyond the virial radius , probably reaching the infall region of haloes .",
    "it is important to point out that the redefinition of mass does not affect positions and hence only changes the relative age @xmath1 of a galaxy .",
    "since this tentative approximation may be overcorrected as the scale may depend on different parameters ( e.g. mass , age ) , the next section will present an estimator for the size of the region to use for this new definition of peak height based also on the velocity profile of the infall region .",

    "table [ tabla_radius ] shows these radii in units of kpc .",
    "all the galaxies with @xmath135 @xmath131 conserved their virial masses , i.e. @xmath89 , in both cases .",
    "this means that some objects which were initially considered as those with low peak heights , as given by their virial mass , are now associated to regions with higher overdensities , particularly for low virial masses .",
    "we have presented a new proxy for the peak height that can account for the assembly bias at large scales ( section [ sec_redefinition_full ] ) . in some cases",
    "this model considers the mass enclosed by radii greater than the virial radius , inside which one could be including other haloes . in order to see differences between the old and young populations and how these could affect the statistics for @xmath41 and @xmath136 , figure [ freq ]",
    "shows the number of haloes inside each new peak height ( when @xmath137 ) , excluding the central galaxy , as a function of the ratio between their virial mass and the virial mass of the central galaxy , @xmath138 , for the mass ranges and parameters shown in figure [ best_ratio ] .",
    "as can be seen from both panels , there is a trend where the number of haloes contained in spheres of size @xmath6 around young galaxies ( blue ) is lower than that for spheres around old objects ( red ) , the effect being stronger for higher virial masses ( right panel ) .",
    "therefore , the peak for an old galaxy , after taking into account the parametrisation of the radius from equation ( [ eq_r_prm ] ) , adds more haloes and mass than for a young object .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the higher the virial mass , the lower is the influence of other haloes in defining the new peak height for galaxies .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    another interesting result is that , for the parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 , both old ( solid red lines ) and young ( dotted blue lines ) populations tend to add massive peaks , as can be seen from the left panel of figure [ freq ] , which shows that the maximum ratio where the distribution is non - zero is log(@xmath139 ) @xmath7 4 , but the minimum is log(@xmath139 ) @xmath140 and 0.4 for the old and young galaxies , respectively . for the case @xmath113 and @xmath114 , young objects ( long - dashed blue curves ) show a peak around @xmath2 = 0.6@xmath9@xmath138 , but they include a broad range of more massive haloes .",
    "old objects ( dashed red curves ) are characterised by this same behaviour and additionally show a peak at log(@xmath139 ) @xmath7 1.7 .",
    "these results indicate that old , low - mass objects are surrounded preferentially by high - mass haloes .",
    "the latter is consistent with recent results which show that old , low - mass galaxies suffer truncation of matter by nearby massive haloes @xcite .",
    "however , our results also indicate that there is a population of low - mass objects which are surrounded by smaller masses . in particular , for the @xmath115 and @xmath116 case ,",
    "this is only seen for old objects , regardless of their @xmath138 .",
    "it is possible that galaxies with low and high @xmath139 ratios correspond to different aspects of the assembly bias phenomenology .",
    "this , along with studies of the prevalence of this bias by varying the concentration , number of satellites , triaxiality , spin , and other halo parameters , are the focus of a forthcoming paper ( et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we have presented a new approach to estimate the overdensity peak height with the aim to understand the assembly bias effect .",
    "this is a relevant issue that could affect the ability of the next generation of galaxy surveys to infer accurate cosmological parameters .",
    "our method consisted in redefining the overdensity that characterises each galaxy using the information of its virial mass and the relative age , @xmath1 ; this new definition is proposed as a better alternative than the virial mass .",
    "wang et al . ( 2007 ) pointed out that old , low - mass haloes at @xmath141 are associated to higher overdensities in the initial conditions , compared to what would be expected from their final virial masses . instead of searching for the overdensity at high redshifts , we try to obtain a measure of the present - day peak height , which in turn can be tested using large , @xmath141 surveys . in order to do this ,",
    "we measure the assembly bias amplitude using two estimators , the two - point correlation function and the infall velocity profile .",
    "we find that when using the mass inside spheres of radius @xmath6 from equation ( [ eq_r_prm ] ) with the parameters in table [ tabla_prm ] , galaxies do not show significant differences in the two - halo regime for objects of a given mass range but different age .",
    "furthermore , the dependence on the age is reduced in the one - halo term as well ; the biggest difference is of a factor of two for the lowest mass bin at a separation of @xmath142 150 @xmath11 kpc , which  when using virial masses  becomes a difference of two orders of magnitude in the clustering amplitude at the same scale .",
    "the best - fit parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 imply that the relative age is not strictly necessary ( see equation [ eq_r_prm ] ) to find a peak height that includes the mass that has not collapsed completely onto haloes yet , and at the same time traces the assembly bias .",
    "we found that the best parameters are those that yield median sphere radii in the range of 1 - 4 @xmath88 .",
    "clearly , environmental effects out to these distances are playing the main role in shaping the two - halo term , as shown in fig .",
    "[ best_ratio ] .",
    "it is worth to point out that only low - mass objects , with @xmath143 @xmath131 , are subject to a change in their peak heights , which coincides with the mass limit for assembly bias found by several authors ( e.g. gao et al .",
    "this is also the case for our second - best fitting parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which introduce a dependence of the peak height on the age , and help trace the assembly bias while at the same time produce final masses that are in excellent agreement with the smt mass function .",
    "therefore , this option is the preferred one to obtain a proxy for the peak height which is not subject to the assembly bias effect .    neighbouring massive haloes that are typically at distances out to 4 @xmath88 ( see figs .",
    "[ best_ratio ] and [ freq ] ) are probably responsible for these effects .",
    "these could disrupt the normal growth of small objects and , therefore , affect their ages .",
    "however , we also find a population of haloes which , with the new definition , includes nearby low - mass haloes , particularly for old objects .",
    "to summarise , we stress the apparent fact that particularly for low - mass objects , the _ virial _ mass is not an adequate proxy for peak height in the standard eps picture , because equal virial mass objects can actually belong to initial density peaks of very different amplitude , as evidenced in the large differences shown in the 2-halo regime by statistics such as the correlation function and infall velocities .",
    "it is necessary to include a more global environmental component , i.e. the mass of the region that effectively characterises the peak height .",
    "when the latter is taken into account , we obtain the general prescription where the bias responds to the height of the mass peak alone at large scales .",
    "further work is required in order to confirm that this proposed parametrisation of the peak height is enough to account for other variations of clustering of equal mass haloes with different properties such as concentration , spin , etc .",
    "the next papers in this series will study this , along with an application of this method to large surveys .",
