    "theoretical consideration of strongly interacting many - particle systems , such as the atomic nuclei , has a number of difficulties , one of which is constructing of trial wave function .",
    "the wave function used should be characterized by proper set of the definite quantum numbers and corresponding symmetries , taking into account the most important physical modes of nucleon motion .",
    "it is usually assumed that structure of the constructed wave function is well known in the limitsd cases , i.e. in the case where a distance between fragments is very large or when we have a compact one - centre system .",
    "hence , the main attention is paid to determination of correct interpolation expression for the wave function in the intermediate region .",
    "many authors have worked at simultaneous description of both `` compact '' and `` friable '' structures ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "several decades ago due to activity of yu.a.simonov , great attention was paid to the hyperspherical function @xcite method ( the k - harmonic method ) which was considered as a general solution method for the nuclear many - particle problem .",
    "but it was shown that its practical application is limited effectively to compact systems ; moreover , the results obtained @xcite hardly differ from the results calculated using the simplest functions of the oscillator shell model with one variation parameter .    recently quite effective stochastic variational methods @xcite for semirealistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials using a number of multicluster model basic functions have been developed for the case of the lightest ( @xmath2 ) nuclei .",
    "they allow to find almost exact numerical solutions of many particle problems for some variants of nn - forces which are most frequently used in calculations of the light nuclei structure .",
    "unfortunately , only numerical estimations of energies and radii are usually obtained due to complication of the calculations .",
    "thus , results of such microscopic computations rarely can be used for estimation of other nuclear characteristics .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have many - particle wave function in evident form for real efficiency of the method .",
    "moreover , if we have the wave function in the explicit form , we will be able to use it in calculations of different nuclear processes within the nuclear system .    to construct simple and quite flexible microscopic trial wave function of the nucleus which correctly describes both compact and weakly bound states , it is of prime importance at studing of exotic nuclei with anomalous ratio n / z .",
    "it is known that deformation effects are significant in nuclei with @xmath3 .",
    "but concrete calculations are usually performed on the basis of spherical symmetry for cluster wave functions and detailed function for cluster - cluster motion .",
    "recently , we have tried @xcite to take into consideration the deformation effects in the framework of the many - particle oscillator shell model by using the variation principle ( without taking into account the cluster modes ) . in the present paper",
    "we describe microscopic model which employs orbital `` polarization '' as well as cluster degrees of the nucleon motion and exact angular projection .",
    "the model can be used for description of both compact and weakly bound states in the light and medium light atomic nuclei .",
    "below we briefly outline the construction of the trial wave function ( section [ sect2 ] ) and give all matrix elements ( m.e . ) of the basic physical operators needed for our computation ( section [ sect3 ] ) .",
    "the variational calculation results for the nuclei @xmath0be , @xmath1he are given in section [ sect4 ] .",
    "let us split considered a - nucleon system in two subsystems ( @xmath4 ) in such way that nucleon - nucleon interaction inside of each subsystem is a priori stronger then that between the two nucleons in the different fragments .",
    "we introduce the two fragments in order to simplify the account . in case",
    "if there are more fragments , the generalization can be written in a similar way .",
    "note that nucleon motion mode defined by interaction between subsystems will be the `` softest '' .",
    "analysis of the experimental data for the considered nucleus allows to choose correct splitting of a - nucleon system into fragments . as a rule , the most interesting `` physics '' at low energies",
    "is caused by the soft mode which should be the most detailed in the framework of the chosen model .",
    "for example , description of the a - nucleus weak - bound state will be sufficient if we were able to obtain the basic nuclear characteristics as well as the decay @xmath4 threshold on the assumption that separated fragments @xmath5 and @xmath6 are known compact nuclei .    in general , every microscopic model is associated with its own effective nn - potential .",
    "the most known effective nn - potentials have been constructed in the framework of the models based on the shell model wave function with one variation parameter .",
    "it is clear that using such nn - potentials in the more advanced models can be uneffective .",
    "however , this usage can be quite correct if nn - potential was built on the basis of the compact nuclei properties ( e.g. , ones of the magic nuclei @xmath7he , @xmath8o or @xmath9ca ) .",
    "the results of calculations @xcite for the magic nuclei @xmath7he , @xmath8o are rather similar for both simple and advanced model , therefore is valid to use mentioned above nn - potentials for the `` polarized '' orbitals model .",
    "let us further consider the standard microscopic nuclear model @xcite based on the many - nucleon hamiltonian with two - particle central exchange interaction @xmath10 where the radius dependence of the potential components can be represented by gaussian superposition , i.e. @xmath11 } \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{\\mu^2_{\\nu}}\\right ) \\ ; \\ ] ] projection operator @xmath12 in eq.([1 ] ) cut out the state of nucleon pair ( @xmath13 ) with defined spin @xmath14 and isospin @xmath15 .",
    "when fragments are separated enough , the hamiltonian @xmath16 should turn into the sum of separated subsystem hamiltonians plus coulomb repulsion between them due to the short - ranged nature of the nuclear forces @xmath17 i.e. , the limiting cases are known .",
    "the behaviour of the system in the intermediate range where altitude of vector @xmath18 significantly differs from zero , but is not large enough to neglect the nuclear interaction between particles in the different clusters , is open question .",
    "hence , it is necessary to define dependency of the center - of - mass kinetic energy operator @xmath19 on the stage of separation of the a - nucleus into fragments .",
    "we simulate @xmath19 in this range by expression    @xmath20\\cdot    \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{a_1}\\vec{\\nabla}_i\\right)^2-\\ ] ]    @xmath21\\cdot    \\left(\\sum_{j = a_1 + 1}^{a}\\vec{\\nabla}_j\\right)^2-    \\frac{\\hbar^2}{am}\\left(1-\\alpha_s\\right)\\cdot    \\sum_{i=1}^{a_1}\\sum_{j = a_1 + 1}^{a } \\vec{\\nabla}_i\\vec{\\nabla}_j \\ .\\ ] ] in our calculations the value of the parameter @xmath22 @xmath23)$ ] in eq.([4 ] ) was defined by the degree of importance of the pauli principle in the a - nucleon system .",
    "thus , @xmath24 if antisymmetrization acts on the variables of all a nucleons and @xmath25 in the other limiting case when the pauli principle acts only on the nucleons inside the clusters .    a total trial wave function @xmath26 is represented by superposition of a small number of determinant functions @xmath27 where @xmath28-components ( normalized , but generally not orthogonal ) are well known slater determinants @xmath29}(j)\\right ] \\ , \\qquad     f_{\\nu}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det\\left [     < \\phi_i^{[\\nu ] } |\\phi_j^{[\\nu ] } > \\right ] } } \\ , \\ ] ] filled by one - particle orbitals which have unificated form : @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the spin - isospin function and",

    "in order to perform the variational calculations it is necessary to obtain the matrix elements of some physical operators . needed overlap integrals can be expressed in terms of `` partial '' m.e . on the basis of the function set ( [ 7 ] ) using known determinant function technique @xcite .    at the beginning , we consider overlap integral of the functions @xmath28 with unity , i.e. @xmath37}|\\phi_j^{[\\mu ] } >",

    "first we consider numerical results obtained with one - center functions @xmath26 ( models n2n6 ) .",
    "the data in table [ tab1 ] show that the most binding energy growth is caused by taking into account the oscillator field deformation ( compare models n6 and n5 ) .",
    "independent orbital `` polarization '' is also significant ( compare models n5 and n4 ) .",

    "hence , the deformation effects can be considered using only one one - center slater determinant .",

    "[ fig1 ] that distance between density maximums ( centers of mass for two @xmath114-particles ) is @xmath163 fm . density of junction between @xmath114-particles is approximately 0.7@xmath164 .",

    "wave function of model i is a slater determinant for 6 nucleons filled by orbitals ( [ 31 ] ) , and contains four variation parameters : @xmath172 , @xmath149 for first four orbitals and @xmath150 , @xmath151 for the last two orbitals .",
    "wave function of the second model is superposition of a few slater determinants , similarly to the @xmath0be : one - center determinant ( model  i ) and two - center determinants with centers in points @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "this model contains 10 nonlinear variation parameters whose optimum values for the considered variants of nn - forces are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "it should be remembered , that a core in @xmath1he is nucleus @xmath7he . its energy calculated using simple su(3)-model function is equal for three variants of nn - forces : @xmath175 mev , @xmath176 mev , @xmath177 mev .",
    "comparison of these values with @xmath1he ground state energies in table [ tab2 ] shows that two neutrons are bound only in the case of model ii and nn - potentials v1 and g5 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that wave function of model ii describes the real systems more accurate than one - center function of model i.    note that authors do nt claim superexact description of the considered here nuclear systems which has been already studied profoundly by many authors ( see , for example , refs .",
    "the purpose of this study is to clarify the question about significance of `` compact '' and `` loosely bound '' structures at consideration of nuclear states using simple trial wave functions .    performed analysis allows to draw up some general scheme for the construction of the simplest and quite flexible trial wave function of weakly bound state as well as a strategy for concrete computation .",
    "first , possible significance of the deformation in formation of considered nucleus state is roughly estimated in the framework of the one - center determinant function model .",
    "next , cluster degrees of freedom are taken into account .",
    "hierarchy of the nucleon motion modes can be determined using non - projected wave functions @xmath26 that significantly reduces computations . moreover , such reduced evaluations give approximate optimum values for almost all variation parameters ( for example , compare corresponding parameters of models n7 and n8 in table [ tab1 ] ) .",
