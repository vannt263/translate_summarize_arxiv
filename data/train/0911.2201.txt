    "frequent measurements can slow down the evolution of a quantum system and eventually hinder any transition to states different from the initial one .",
    "this phenomenon , first considered by beskow and nilsson  @xcite in their study of the decay of unstable systems , was named quantum zeno effect by misra and sudarshan  @xcite , who suggested a parallelism with the paradox of the arrow by the philosopher zeno of elea .    since then , the quantum zeno effect has received constant attention by physicists and mathematicians , who explored different facets of the phenomenon .",
    "the whole field is very active . for an up - to - date review of the main mathematical and physical aspects ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the quantum zeno effect has been observed experimentally in a variety of systems , on experiments involving photons , nuclear spins , ions , optical pumping , photons in a cavity , ultracold atoms and bose - einstein condensates . in all the above - mentioned implementations ,",
    "the quantum system is forced to remain in its initial state through a measurement associated to a one - dimensional projection .",
    "no experiment has been performed so far in order to check the multi - dimensional quantum zeno effect and the quantum zeno dynamics , that is the effective limiting dynamics inside the measured subspace .",
    "however , these ideas might lead to remarkable applications , e.g.  in quantum computation and in the control of decoherence .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "the quantum zeno dynamics is related to the limit of a product formula obtained by intertwining the dynamical time evolution group with the orthogonal projection associated with the measurements performed on the system .",
    "it can be viewed as a generalization of trotter - kato product formulae @xcite to more singular objects in which one semigroup is replaced by a projection .    since the seminal paper by misra and sudarshan @xcite , the main object of interest has been the limit of the quantum zeno dynamics product formula .",
    "its structure has been thoroughly investigated and has been well characterized under quite general hypotheses . in particular , by assuming that the hamiltonian is lower bounded and the limit is strongly continuous , one obtains a unitary group within the projected subspace @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the much more difficult question of the existence of this limit , for infinite dimensional projections and unbounded hamiltonian , is still open .",
    "since this product formula and its properties are of great importance in the study of quantum dynamical semigroups and have remarkable consequences both in mathematical physics and operator theory , there have been many investigations from different perspectives and motivations .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .    in 2005",
    "exner and ichinose  @xcite proved the existence of a quantum zeno dynamics when the hamiltonian is positive and the domain of its square root has a dense intersection with the range @xmath0 of the projection .",
    "however , this result was proved in the @xmath1 topology , instead of the more natural strong operator topology . as a corollary of the main result",
    ", they solved the problem in the norm operator topology when the projections are finite dimensional .",
    "the first main result that we present in this paper is a complete characterization of the multi - dimensional quantum zeno effect , for hamiltonians that are not necessarily lower bounded , through the introduction of a novel product formula directly related to the quantum zeno effect .",
    "we show that the existence of the limit is related to a fall - off property of the spectral measure of the hamiltonian in the range of the projection .",
    "then , we also exhibit a characterization of the quantum zeno dynamics , in terms of the above - mentioned energy fall - off property and of the existence of a mean value hamiltonian in a generalized sense .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss the relation between the quantum zeno effect and its limiting dynamics , in particular we recall the product formula related to the quantum zeno dynamics .",
    "then , we introduce a new product formula which is directly related to the quantum zeno effect and present our first theorem on the characterization of the existence of its limit .",
    "finally , in the second theorem , we will give a characterization of the related quantum zeno dynamics .",
    "moreover , we consider an example that explains the differences between the conditions that imply the quantum zeno dynamics and the quantum zeno effect .",
    "the proofs of the theorems are postponed to section [ sec : iff condition ] .",
    "consider a quantum system @xmath2 , whose states are described by density operators , that are positive operators with unit trace , in a complex separable hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "the time evolution of the system is governed by a unitary group @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a time - independent self - adjoint hamiltonian .",
    "consider also an orthogonal projection @xmath6 , that describes the measurement process that is performed on @xmath2 .",
    "this kind of measurement ascertains whether the system is in the subspace @xmath7 .",
    "assume that the initial density operator @xmath8 of the system has support in @xmath9 , namely @xmath10 the state of the system at time @xmath11 is @xmath12 and after a measurement , if the outcome is positive , it becomes @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "observe that , since @xmath6 is not assumed to commute with the hamiltonian , when @xmath16\\neq 0 $ ] , the unitary evolution drives the system outside @xmath9 , and @xmath17 is in general smaller than unity .    if we perform a series of @xmath6-observations on @xmath2 at time @xmath18 , @xmath19 , its state after @xmath20 positive measurements is , up to a normalization , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the survival probability in @xmath9 reads @xmath23 our interest is focused on the following question : under what conditions @xmath24 misra and sudarshan @xcite baptized this problem _ quantum zeno effect _",
    "( qze ) : repeated @xmath6-observations in succession inhibit transitions outside the observed subspace @xmath9",
    ". that is , rephrasing the greek philosopher zeno , the observed quantum arrow does not move .    since the seminal paper @xcite",
    ", the main object of interest has been the limit of the following product formula @xmath25 and in particular whether @xmath26 exists and is given by a unitary group in @xmath9 .",
    "the existence of a unitary limit is tantamount to the presence of a _",
    "quantum zeno dynamics _ ( qzd ) .",
    "if this is the case , one immediately gets @xmath27 by the cyclic property of the trace .",
    "namely , qzd implies qze .    the following theorem , due to exner and ichinose @xcite , about the existence of the limit of the qzd product formula ( [ ampl . form ] )",
    "when @xmath6 is a finite rank projection and @xmath5 is positive , provides a sufficient condition for the quantum zeno effect . for a simple proof of this result see @xcite .",
    "[ th : ei ] let @xmath3 be a complex hilbert space and @xmath5 a positive self - adjoint operator with dense domain @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath6 be an orthogonal finite - rank projection onto @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the domain of the square root of @xmath5 , then @xmath32 uniformly for @xmath33 in finite intervals of @xmath34 .    the hypothesis @xmath30 on the pair hamiltonian  projection can be regarded as a condition on the spectral measure of @xmath5 over the range of @xmath6 in the following way : for every @xmath35 one gets @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the projection - valued measure associated to @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the above result can be summarized as follows : whenever a positive hamiltonian has a finite mean value @xmath38 on vector states in the range of @xmath6 , frequently @xmath6-observations force the state of the system to remain in the subspace @xmath9 and the limiting dynamics in this space is given by the unitary group @xmath39 .",
    "as a consequence , finite - energy states exhibit a quantum zeno effect .",
    "one can ask if the sufficient condition ( [ mean value - spectral measure ] ) is also necessary for the quantum zeno effect .",
    "we will show that the answer to this question is negative .",
    "indeed , the qze implies a condition weaker than ( [ mean value - spectral measure ] ) on the spectral measure of @xmath5 .    the first result of this paper is a characterization of the multi - dimensional quantum zeno effect . in order to achieve our goal",
    "we look at the problem from a different perspective . instead of considering the product formula ( [ ampl .",
    "form ] ) , let us move back our attention to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pn(t ) ] ) and ( [ eq : qzedef ] ) . by invoking the cyclic property of the trace",
    ", we will study the limit of the following product formula @xmath40 one gets that the quantum zeno effect ( [ eq : qzedef ] ) takes place if and only if @xmath41 we will call ( [ nzpf ] ) _ qze product formula _ , as opposed to the qzd product formula ( [ ampl . form ] ) .",
    "the next theorem is on the equivalence between the quantum zeno effect and a certain fall - off condition on the spectral measure associated to the hamiltonian , that is weaker than ( [ mean value - spectral measure ] ) .",
    "let us denote , as usual , with @xmath42 an operator - valued function defined in a neighbourhood of @xmath43 and such that @xmath44 , for @xmath45 .",

    "consider the product formula @xmath49 , where @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "[ fdtc ] @xmath53 2 .",
    "@xmath54 3 .   @xmath55 + uniformly for @xmath33 in finite intervals of @xmath34 .",
    "two comments are now in order .",
    "first , by taking the matrix element of condition [ fdtc ] .",
    "one obtains that for any @xmath35 @xmath56 that is @xmath57 let us compare ( [ eq : falloff ] ) with condition ( [ mean value - spectral measure ] ) . under the hypotheses of theorem [ th : ei ] , namely , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , one gets @xmath60 when @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , condition ( [ eq : falloff ] ) is implied by ( [ mean value - spectral measure ] ) , but it is weaker than the latter .",
    "second , when the measurement projection is one - dimensional , we can write @xmath62 , for some @xmath35 and @xmath63 . physically , this projection checks whether the system is in the pure state @xmath64 .",
    "in this case we get @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the _ survival probability amplitude _ in the state @xmath64 .",
    "its associated probability is @xmath67 and represents the probability of finding at time @xmath68 in state @xmath64 a system that started in @xmath64 at time @xmath43 .",
    "note that the survival amplitude can be rewritten as @xmath69 where @xmath70 , for every borel set @xmath71 , is the spectral measure of @xmath5 at @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 is nothing but the fourier transform of the spectral measure @xmath73 , i.e.  a characteristic function , in probabilistic jargon .    since @xmath74^n$ ]",

    "the following proposition , stated for a generic borel probability measure on @xmath34 , gives a characterization of the limit ( [ eq : qze1dim ] ) in terms of the fall - off property of the spectral measure @xmath73 for large energy values .",

    "interestingly enough , the first step in the proof of our main theorem [ iff condition qze multidimensional ] is proposition [ iff condition qze ] ( which is a special case of the first ! )    [ iff condition qze ] let @xmath78 be a borel measure on @xmath34 , with @xmath79",

    "<S> this phenomenon is related to the limit of a product formula obtained by intertwining the time evolution group with an orthogonal projection .    by introducing a novel product formula we will give a characterization of the quantum zeno effect for finite - rank projections , in terms of a spectral decay property of the hamiltonian in the range of the projections . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we will also characterize its limiting quantum zeno dynamics and exhibit its ( not necessarily lower - bounded ) generator as a generalized mean value hamiltonian . </S>"
