    "a low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) code is a linear code , whose parity - check matrix @xmath7 satisfies the following structural properties : ( 1 ) each row consists of @xmath8 `` ones '' ; ( 2 ) each column consists of @xmath9 `` ones '' ; ( 3 ) the number of `` ones '' in common between any two columns , denoted by @xmath10 , is no greater than 1 ; ( 4 ) both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are small compared to the length of the code and the number of rows in @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the ldpc codes defined above are called _",
    "regular_. throughout this paper , we restrict attention to regular ldpc codes .",
    "the concept of ldpc codes was first introduced by gallager in 1960 s  @xcite . however , this remarkable invention was almost disregarded for the deficiency of capacity computation by researchers in the following thirty years .",
    "it was not until late 1990 s and early 2000 s that mackay and neal rediscovered ldpc codes  @xcite .",
    "after that , a lot of efforts have been devoted to designing and constructing efficient ldpc codes . according to different constructing methods",
    ", ldpc codes can be classified into two main categories : computer - generated pseudo - random ldpc codes and well - structured ldpc codes . in general , the performance of well - structured ldpc codes is not as good as computer - generated pseudo - random ones .",
    "but such codes are needed for implementation in the sense that their properties can be explicitly determined in many cases . the well - structured ldpc codes are constructed using various methods , e.g. , finite geometry  @xcite , graphs  @xcite , partial geometry  @xcite , combinatorial designs  @xcite , generalized polygons  @xcite and so on .",
    "let @xmath11 be a binary @xmath12 $ ] linear code and @xmath7 be a parity - check matrix of the code @xmath11 .",
    "a _ stopping set _ in @xmath11 is the support of a binary vector having the length @xmath13 that does not have exactly one @xmath14 in common with any row of @xmath7 .",
    "the minimum size of non - empty stopping sets of @xmath11 is called the _ stopping distance _ of the code @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the minimum distance determines the code s error correcting capacity and the stopping distance is an important measure of the performance of iterative decoding over the binary erasure channel .",
    "thus , the study of the minimum distance and the stopping distance of a code is important in both theory and applications .",
    "however , in most cases , it is rather difficult to determine the minimum distance and the stopping distance of a specific ldpc code .",
    "kou , lin , and fossorier  @xcite constructed four classes of ldpc codes based on points and lines of finite geometries and gave the lower bounds of the minimum distance .",
    "in several special cases , the minimum distance of the codes were determined .",
    "later , tang , xu , lin and abdel - ghaffar  @xcite provided constructing methods based on hyperplanes of two consecutive dimensions of the finite geometries , which generalized the idea of  @xcite .",
    "they also got the lower bounds of the minimum distance .",
    "xia and fu  @xcite obtained the lower bounds of the stopping distance of these codes .",
    "kim , peled , perepelitsa , pless , and friedland  @xcite gave an explicit construction of two classes of ldpc codes based on @xmath16-regular bipartite graphs .",
    "they determined the minimum distance and the stopping distance for some special cases , and got the lower bounds for some other cases .",
    "recently , feng , deng , wang , and ma  @xcite presented three classes of ldpc codes based on the totally isotropic subspaces of symplectic , unitary and orthogonal spaces over finite fields respectively and determined the minimum distance for some cases .    in this paper",
    ", we first construct a bipartite graph @xmath17 with the adjacency matrix @xmath18 whose vertex set contains points and maximal sets of rank @xmath14 of @xmath0 .",
    "a point is adjacent to a maximal set of rank @xmath14 if and only if the maximal set of rank 1 contains the point .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath18 and @xmath19 both satisfy the four structural properties of parity - check matrices of ldpc codes .",
    "then we obtain two classes of ldpc codes , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , whose parity - check matrices are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "several properties of these two classes of ldpc codes are investigated , including the girth , the minimum distance , the stopping distance and the dimension .",
    "some simulation results show that the constructed ldpc codes perform better than random codes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec - pre ] we give a brief introduction to the space of @xmath1 symmetric matrices over @xmath2 , and present some auxiliary results . in section  [ sec - const ] , we construct the two classes of binary girth-@xmath5 ldpc codes , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "both the minimum distance and the stopping distance of @xmath4 and @xmath3 are mainly discussed in section  [ sec - main ] .",
