    "<S> the conjecture relates type iib superstrings on @xmath12 to @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath1 yang - mills in 4 dimensions and allows to compute the next - to - leading order correction to @xmath13 in the strong coupling limit  @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the t  hooft coupling . </S>",

    "<S> the infrared ( ir ) behavior of field theories at finite @xmath22 however prevents us from computing the free energy density in the form just described . </S>",
    "<S> there are two sources of ir divergences . </S>",

    "<S> diagrams with self - energy insertions have ir divergences that do not cancel order by order in the coupling constant . a second source of ir divergences , which is specific to non - abelian gauge theories , has to do with the gauge field self - interaction terms .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective field theory approach allows to remove systematically the ir divergences associated to thermal mass insertions . also , ir divergences related with the gauge field self - coupling terms are isolated and interpreted as a source of non - perturbative effects  @xcite . in the effective field theory approach for gauge theories , </S>",
    "<S> a hierarchy of two effective field theories in 3 dimensions which only contain static modes are constructed . </S>",
    "<S> since , in addition , these effective field theories do not contain fermionic fields , they are very convenient for non - perturbative studies on the lattice  @xcite .- theory is studied in  @xcite , qcd in  @xcite , qed in  @xcite , and scalar qed in  @xcite . the electroweak phase transition has been studied in the standard model  @xcite and in some of the minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model  @xcite . ]    if non - static modes are integrated out in the partition function @xmath32 , we can write @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an effective lagrangian compatible with the internal symmetries of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 describes a 3 dimensional effective field theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 is made out of an electrostatic field @xmath35 , a magnetostatic gauge field @xmath36 , and 6 scalars @xmath37 , where @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> these fields can be identified , up to field redefinitions , with the static modes of their 4 dimensional counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> note that fermion fields have been integrated out completely because they do not have a static mode . </S>",
    "<S> we can write @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a constant that can not be ignored when computing the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 contains the remaining terms and has the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the magnetostatic field strength with gauge coupling constant @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath45 in  ( [ lesym ] ) represents an infinite number of terms constructed out of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 that contribute only at order higher than @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 contains non - renormalizable interaction terms . </S>",
    "<S> we call the effective theory constructed by integrating out non - static modes _ electrostatic </S>",
    "<S> _ sym ( esym ) . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy can be written as @xmath50 , where @xmath51    we can go a step further by integrating out @xmath46 , and @xmath48 in  ( [ zesym ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an effective lagrangian compatible with the internal symmetries of the theory which is made out of a magnetostatic gauge field @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we can write @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 is of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the magnetostatic field strength with coupling constant @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath61 in  ( [ lmsym ] ) represents an infinite number of terms constructed out of @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we call this theory _ magnetostatic </S>",
    "<S> _ sym ( msym ) because it is made out of magnetostatic fields only . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy can therefore be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63    we may think of using  ( [ fem ] ) to compute the free energy density of sym . </S>",
    "<S> we need to determine @xmath40 , the effective parameters of @xmath64 , @xmath56 , and the effective parameters of @xmath57 . the term @xmath40 and the effective parameters of @xmath64 may be determined by computing the same physical quantities in both the full theory ( sym ) and in the effective field theory described by @xmath34 ( esym ) and comparing the result . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> this procedure may seem useless if we consider that to compute physical quantities in the full theory we have to remove the ir divergences . </S>",
    "<S> it is like having to face the very same problem we wanted to solve at the beginning . </S>",
    "<S> however , to compare results , it is actually enough to compute them in a region where we know that both theories describe the same physics .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , self - energy insertions of order @xmath31 in the full theory give rise to ir divergences . </S>",
    "<S> if we introduce an ir momentum cutoff @xmath65 , we will obtain physical quantities as expansions in powers of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion diverges when @xmath65 goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we demand @xmath67 , the expansion makes sense . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the result depends on @xmath65 and one can not get rid of it unless an infinite number of diagrams are summed up . in the effective theory , the thermal masses ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) are also of order @xmath31 ( we will explicitly see it below ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an ir momentum cutoff @xmath67 is equivalent to treating the mass terms in @xmath34 as interaction terms . by computing physical quantities in this way and comparing the results , we are able to determine the parameters of the effective theory ( esym ) as functions of @xmath22 , @xmath28 , and @xmath70 .    once we have determined the parameters of esym by matching , we can use esym as an ordinary field theory . in general , when computing diagrams using esym , we will encounter ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences . </S>",
    "<S> these uv divergences can be regulated by introducing a uv momentum cutoff @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , esym is not fully free of ir divergences . in order to regulate the ir divergences originated by the gauge boson self - interaction terms in esym </S>",
    "<S> , we have to introduce an ir momentum cutoff @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> analogously to what happened to the full theory with ir cutoff @xmath65 , we can make sense of the perturbative expansion of esym only if @xmath73  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the uv cutoff of esym has to satisfy @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath67 and @xmath73 , we can think of @xmath65 as @xmath75 and @xmath72 as @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can take @xmath65 as the ultraviolet cutoff of esym : @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath65 dependence of the parameters is canceled by the @xmath65 dependence of the loop integrals in esym .    </S>",
    "<S> we see from  ( [ lmsym ] ) that msym is a pure gauge theory in 3 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> it is a confining theory that can not be studied perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> its feynman diagrams only contain gauge field self - interaction terms and one should expect the same ir problems that we have already pointed out for the full theory and esym . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we introduce an ir momentum cutoff @xmath73 , we can still use a diagrammatic expansion to determine the effective parameters of msym by matching physical quantities with esym . </S>",
    "<S> of course , although we may be able to determine the effective parameters of msym , @xmath78 in  ( [ fem ] ) has still to be calculated non - perturbatively .    </S>",
    "<S> we write `` @xmath79 '' to denote that the physical quantity @xmath80 has been computed using the ir cutoffs @xmath65 or @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> an expression of this type for @xmath80 is suitable for matching but it should not be confused with a _ correct _ perturbative expansion ( which should have the ir divergences removed ) . the perturbative expansions performed with ir cutoffs are called _ strict _ perturbation expansions .    so far , we have used momentum cutoffs to learn how to organize the perturbative expansion of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills at finite @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it turns out to be more convenient to use a regulator that automatically gets rid of power divergences . </S>",
    "<S> such a regulator is dimensional regularization . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore consider the full theory in @xmath81 dimensions . since , in the present note , we are interested in computing the free energy density of @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath1 yang - mills to order @xmath20 , we limit ourselves to the effective parameters and corrections that contribute to such an order .    the strict perturbation expansions in the full theory can be greatly simplified </S>",
    "<S> if we consider that @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills in 4 dimensions ( sym@xmath82 ) can be obtained by dimensional reduction of @xmath83 supersymmetric yang - mills in 10 dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> physical quantities in sym@xmath82 can be obtained perturbatively by using sym@xmath84 feynman rules while loop integrals are performed in 4 dimensions ( sym@xmath85 )  @xcite . in this formulation , </S>",
    "<S> the 10d @xmath86 can be identified , up to scale redefinitions , with the 4d gauge field @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining @xmath88 are identified with the 6 scalars @xmath89 of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills in 4d . while leading order contributions to the _ strict _ perturbation expansions in the full theory can be easily computed using either sym@xmath82 or sym@xmath85 , higher than leading order contributions </S>",
    "<S> are much less arduous in sym@xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> the gauge coupling constant of esym , @xmath44 , can be read off from the lagrangian of the full theory . by substituting @xmath91 in the lagrangian of sym@xmath82 and comparing @xmath92 with @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> , we find out , to leading order in @xmath93 , @xmath94    in qcd , the gauge invariant electric screening mass is given by the pole location of the @xmath95 component of the complete gluon propagator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will use a similar definition in sym . </S>",
    "<S> using sym@xmath90 , the inverse gauge field propagator has the form @xmath96 $ ] . in order to compute the static masses in @xmath64 , it is convenient to define @xmath97 and @xmath98 such that @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are performed in feynman gauge .    </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic mass @xmath68 is determined by computing the electric screening mass in the full theory and matching it with the result obtained in esym . </S>",
    "<S> the electric screening in sym is the solution to the equation @xmath101 note that  ( [ meldef ] ) gives rise to a double expansion in powers of @xmath28 ( or equivalently , in number of loops ) and in powers of @xmath102 . in the calculation of the free energy to order @xmath20 , </S>",
    "<S> it is enough to compute @xmath103 at one - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> then , the expression for the electric screening mass to leading order in @xmath93 is @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> diagrammatically , @xmath105 is given by the graphs shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]@xmath106 .    </S>",
    "<S> these diagrams give rise to sum - integrals that can easily be evaluated by using standard methods  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in the full theory , the strict perturbation expansion for @xmath107 is @xmath108 in esym , the electric screening mass @xmath107 gives the location of the pole in the propagator for the field @xmath109 . denoting the self - energy function by @xmath110 , @xmath107 is the solution to @xmath111 similarly to  ( [ meldef ] ) , ( [ msdefeff ] ) also gives rise to a double expansion in number of loops and in powers of @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the strict perturbation expansion of @xmath68 is obtained as an expansion involving feynman diagrams evaluated at zero external momentum . since @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 are treated as perturbation parameters , there is no energy scale in the dimensionally regularized integrals and they all vanish . </S>",
    "<S> the solution to the equation ( [ msdefeff ] ) for the screening mass is therefore trivial : @xmath112 . comparing this result with ( [ melpert ] ) , we find that , to leading order in @xmath93 @xmath113    the calculation of the scalar static mass @xmath69 is similar to the calculation of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> we define a scalar screening mass @xmath114 which satisfies @xmath115 at @xmath116 in the full theory and an equation analogous to  ( [ msdefeff ] ) in the effective theory . after comparing the result in sym with the result in esym </S>",
    "<S> , we find that , to leading order in @xmath93 @xmath117    the effective parameter @xmath40 is evaluated by matching the calculation of the free energy density in the full theory and in the effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> the leading order contribution to the free energy density in the full theory is given by a familiar result from blackbody radiation @xmath118 , where @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) is the number of bosonic ( fermionic ) degrees of freedom of the theory . </S>",

    "<S> it has been suggested  @xcite that there could be a phase transition in @xmath21 at large @xmath3 . even though perturbative calculations can not settle the debate on this matter , it may be possible to find an indication of a phase transition by using pade approximants . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of  ( [ f3 ] ) using pade approximants has been carried out in  @xcite . there </S>",
    "<S> , an indication has been found of a smooth interpolation between the weak and strong coupling regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective field theory approach provides a systematic way to compute perturbative contributions to the free energy of sym while taking advantage of dimensional reduction ( sym@xmath90 ) to determine the effective parameters of esym . </S>",
    "<S> this is a major simplification for computing @xmath19 to order less than @xmath144  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> starting at order @xmath144 , there are non - perturbative contributions as well as perturbative contributions . </S>",
    "<S> non - perturbative effects are described by msym , a pure gauge theory in 3 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> as we have already pointed out , the effective field theory approach gives rise to effective field theories in 3 dimensions , without fermions , that are suitable for non - perturbative studies on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> lattice simulations of the effective field theories could therefore be used to explore the non - perturbative sector of @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath1 yang - mills . </S>"
