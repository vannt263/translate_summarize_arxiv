    "initially , this process has been explained by four - wave mixing rectification via third - order nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "however , a threshold for thz generation @xcite as well as plasma current measurements @xcite indicated that plasma formation plays an important role in the generation process .",

    "the quasi - dc plasma current can be efficiently produced in a gas irradiated by two - color laser pulses @xcite , in multicolor pump schemes @xcite and in chirped @xcite or few - cycle pulses @xcite .",
    "results published so far @xcite provide several important features of the thz spectrum .",
    "however , a general framework for analysis , control and design of thz radiation is still missing . similar to pulse shaping techniques in the optical range ,",
    "the broadband control of thz waveforms and its spectral properties is highly desirable for many applications , while the existing techniques are applicable only for a narrow bandwidth of few thz @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we advance the understanding of the fundamental physics in thz generation in gases as well as examine its basic mechanism associated with plasma formation .",
    "we demonstrate that thz generation in gases is intrinsically connected to optically - induced stepwise increase of the plasma density due to tunneling ionization .",
    "new spectral components are emitted in a discrete set of attosecond - scale , ultra - broadband bursts associated with these ionization events ; in the spectral representation thz emission results from an interference of these radiation bursts .    using appropriate field shapes of the pump pulses , e.g. tuning the frequencies and phases of two- or multi - color pulses , the temporal positions of the ionization events can be controlled . in turn , this allows to design the emitted radiation within a broad spectral range of more than 100 thz .",
    "this new concept of prescribing the phase and amplitude of each elementary contribution responsible for thz emission has a remarkable analogy in linear diffraction theory : the produced spectrum can be understood like the far - field diffraction pattern of a grating , where the ionization events play the role of the slits . a comprehensive",

    "@xmath42    in other words , the resulting thz spectrum is a simple linear superposition of the contributions @xmath43 and its structure is mainly governed by interference due to the spectral phases @xmath44 .",

    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq:4 ] ) describes sharp attosecond - long bursts of radiation localized near the ionization events .",
    "further on , the same simple superposition principle is also valid for higher frequencies in the more general eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : base](d ) shows that constructive spectral interference in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) appears also for frequencies @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is integer .",
    "this finding is consistent with recent experimental results  @xcite , where optical harmonics generated due to tunneling - ionization - induced modulations of the electron density were observed .",
    "therefore , our superposition principle may also offer a complementary understanding of brunel radiation  @xcite .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ eq:4 ] ) shows that thz generation can be understood completely analogous to far - field interference patterns produced by a diffraction grating @xcite , where the ionization events play the role of the slits .",
    "each of such `` slits '' produces a broad `` secondary wave '' , and their interference results in narrow lines , according to the huygens - fresnel principle @xcite .",
    "thz radiation then corresponds to the zeroth diffraction order .",

    "such inverse dependence of the thz spectral width on the pump duration was already observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is also compatible [ black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : base](f ) ] with comprehensive 3d simulations , where propagation and transverse effects are accounted for ( see methods ) .",
    "understanding the spectrum of the radiation emitted by the plasma current @xmath52 as an interference pattern provides a deeper insight into the mechanism responsible for the thz generation . beyond that , this understanding provides us with the possibility to shape the emitted radiation by suitable engineering of the pump field . here",
    ", we will restrict ourself to the thz and far - infrared domain described by eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "the latter indicates that , in order to control the thz spectral shape , we have to target the times of the ionization events @xmath4 and the values of @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fig : scont ] shows several examples of thz generation from simple variations of the two - color scheme . variations of the relative phase @xmath54 between fundamental and second harmonic component of the pump pulse have a strong influence on the thz spectral shape [ see cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ] , in addition to the known dependency of the thz yield  @xcite .",
    "this observation can be readily explained within our linear interference framework . for @xmath55 ( case 1 ) the coefficients @xmath45 are not sign definite [ red and blue circles in fig .  [ fig : scont](a ) ] .",
    "thus , for @xmath56 different contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) cancel each other , that is , destructive interference dominates .",
    "nevertheless , with increasing frequency @xmath40 the destructive interference is ( partially ) compensated by the spectral phases @xmath44 .",

    "in contrast , for @xmath15 ( case 2 ) all coefficients @xmath45 are positive .",
    "this obviously ensures that at @xmath56 constructive interference dominates , and the phase factor @xmath44 can lead only to destructive interference when @xmath40 is increased .",
    "therefore , the spectral maximum is located at zero frequency in this case . moreover , the coefficients @xmath45 are much larger in amplitude , which explains the increased thz yield for @xmath15 .",
    "we verified this behavior by comprehensive ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ( 3d ) numerical modeling ( see methods ) , which was recently successfully compared to experiments  @xcite .",
    "we consider a gaussian input beam with width @xmath58 m and duration ( fwhm ) @xmath59  fs for the 800  nm fundamental pump pulse ( pulse energy @xmath60j ) .",
    "the energy of the second harmonic at 400  nm is chosen as 7.5  % of the fundamental , with duration and width smaller than the values for the fundamental by a factor @xmath61 ( similar to typical experimental conditions ) .",
    "these pulsed input beams are focused with @xmath62  mm into argon at atmospheric pressure .",
    "in contrast to the simple lc model , the phase angle @xmath54 between the two components shifts during propagation . for our particular configuration , an initial value @xmath63 guarantees maximum thz energy yield of @xmath64j ; @xmath65 leads to a minimum yield of @xmath66j ; the generic value @xmath67 yields @xmath68j .",

    "they agree remarkably well with the predictions obtained from eq .",

    "we also observe a high sensitivity of the thz spectra towards detuning of the relative frequency ratio between the two pump components [ see case ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in fig .  [",

    "such pulses with so - called incommensurate sh ( frequency @xmath69 is shifted by @xmath70 ) offer a straightforward control of the position of the maximum thz spectral intensity , without decreasing the total thz yield .",

    "in summary , we have shown that thz emission in gases by multi - color laser fields is intrinsically connected with the attosecond jumps of the plasma density induced by tunneling ionization .",
    "the thz spectrum is described by a superposition of the spectrally ultrabroad contributions from separate ionization events .",

    "<S> applications ranging from nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy to remote sensing require broadband and intense thz radiation which can be generated by focusing two - color laser pulses into a gas . in this setup , </S>",
    "<S> thz radiation originates from the buildup of the electron density in sharp steps of attosecond duration due to tunnel ionization , and subsequent acceleration of free electrons in the laser field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the spectral shape of the thz pulses generated by this mechanism is determined by superposition of contributions from individual ionization events . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a straightforward analogy with linear diffraction theory , where the ionization events play the role of slits in a grating . </S>",
    "<S> this analogy offers simple explanations for recent experimental observations and opens new avenues for thz pulse shaping based on temporal control of the ionization events . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this novel technique by tailoring the spectral width and position of the resulting radiation using multi - color pump pulses . </S>"
