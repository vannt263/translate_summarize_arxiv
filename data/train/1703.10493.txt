    "<S> thermodynamic properties as well as low - energy magnon excitations of @xmath0 honeycomb - layered na@xmath1ni@xmath2sbo@xmath3  have been investigated by high - resolution dilatometry , static magnetisation , and high - frequency electron spin resonance studies in magnetic fields up to 16  t. at @xmath4  = 16.5  k , there is a tricritical point separating two distinct antiferromagnetic phases af1 and af2 from the paramagnetic regime . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our data imply short - range antiferromagnetic correlations at least up to @xmath5@xmath4 . well below @xmath4 , the magnetic field @xmath6@xmath7 9.5  </S>",
    "<S> t is needed to stabilize af2 against af1 . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal expansion and magnetostriction anomalies at @xmath4  and @xmath6  imply significant magnetoelastic coupling , both of which associated with a sign change of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition at @xmath6  is associated with softening of the antiferromagnetic resonance modes observed in the electron spin resonance spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy gap @xmath9  ghz implies considerable uniaxial anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude the crucial role of axial anisotropy favoring the af1 spin structure over the af2 one . </S>",
    "<S> while the magnetostriction data disprove a simple spin - flop scenario at @xmath6 , the nature of a second transition at @xmath10  @xmath7 13  t remains unclear . </S>",
    "<S> both the sign of the magnetostriction and grneisen analysis suggest the short - range correlations at high temperatures to be of af2-type . </S>"
