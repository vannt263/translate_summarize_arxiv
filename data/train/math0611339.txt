    "thus , it is natural to conjecture that perhaps under additional conditions on the distribution of @xmath36 , the function @xmath169 is regularly varying with index -1 .",
    "c.   the memory properties of the figarch process are of course of great interest .",
    "the sequence @xmath45 is a strictly stationary martingale increment sequence , but @xmath26=\\infty$ ] .",
    "so does it hold that the partial sum process @xmath170}x_k$ ] converges weakly to the brownian motion ?",
    "for @xmath171 , do the sequences @xmath172 have distributional long memory in the sense that @xmath173}\\{|x_k|^p-\\mathbb{e}[|x_k|^p]\\}$ ] converge to the fractional brownian motion with hurst index @xmath153 for a suitable @xmath174 ?",
    "d.   statistical inference .",
    "the figarch(@xmath127 ) is a parametric model , so the issue of estimation of its parameter is naturally raised .",
    "also , if @xmath148 is linked to some memory property of the process , semi - parametric estimation of @xmath148 would be of interest .",
