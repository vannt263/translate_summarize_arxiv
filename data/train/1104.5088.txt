    "the effects of fractionated radiotherapy and single dose radiation may be quite different depending on the gap between consecutive fractions . the larger the gap is , the larger the difference , due to the tissue recovery capabilities characteristic times .",
    "fractionated therapies are usually modeled including correction factors in single dose expressions . here",
    ", we will explore how to include fractionation in a recently introduced model derived using the tsallis entropy definition @xcite and the maximum entropy principle . as can be seen in @xcite ( and other works in the same issue ) nonextensive tsallis entropy has become a successful tool to describe a vast class of natural systems .",
    "the new radiobiological model @xcite ( maxent model in what follows ) takes advantage of tsallis formulation to describe the survival fraction as function of the radiation dose , based on a minimum number of statistical and biologically motivated hypotheses .",
    "the maxent model assumes the existence of a critical dose , @xmath0 , that annihilates every single cell in the tissue .",
    "the radiation dose can be written as a dimensionless quantity in terms of that critical dose as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the radiation dose .",
    "then the support of the cell death probability density function , @xmath3 , in terms of the received dose @xmath4 , becomes @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "a tsallis entropy functional can be written , @xmath6,\\label{eq : qentropy}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the nonextensivity index .",
    "the survival fraction of cells will be given by @xmath8 , that is the complement of the fraction of cells killed by radiation . in order to maximize functional",
    "we must consider the normalization condition , @xmath9 also , following @xcite , we must assume the existence of a finite @xmath7-mean value ( or the mean value of the escort probability distribution ) , @xmath10 then the lagrange multipliers method leads to , @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "so , the survival fraction the model predicts is @xmath13 valid for @xmath14 and @xmath15 . this model has shown a remarkable agreement with experimental data @xcite , in particular in those limits where previous models are less accurate , mainly at high doses .",
    "the analysis of the model also provides new hints about the tissue response to radiation : first , the interaction of a tissue with the radiation is universal and characterized by a single exponent ( not dependent on the radiation exposure ) ; second , the model includes a cutoff radiation dose above which every single cell dies .",
    "furthermore , previous models can be obtained as particular limiting cases .",
    "finally , as for those models , its mathematical expression is simple and can be easily plotted and interpreted .",
    "assuming valid for a single radiation dose , the total survival fraction , @xmath16 , for a fractionated treatment consisting of @xmath17 doses should be found as a composition of the survival probabilities of the successive radiation doses .",
    "however , the survival fraction now lacks the extensivity property .",
    "indeed , if two doses , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are applied over a tissue , the resulting survival fraction from their composition has two possible values .",
    "if the dose is assumed as additive , @xmath20 , the survival probabilities of individual cells under the @xmath21 and @xmath22 radiation events could not be treated as independent probabilities , @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "if survival fractions are multiplicative , @xmath24 , doses would not fulfill the superposition principle for the equivalent physical dose , @xmath25 .",
    "the subject of this manuscript is to develop on the composition rules that would lead to the survival fraction and the equivalent physical dose of a fractionated treatment , and to derive the biological implications of such rules .",
    "this will be approached within the framework of the @xmath7-algebra @xcite , as far as it is the natural one for the nonextensive maxent model .",
    "as it has just been exposed , if those composition rules are defined keeping the superposition principle for the dose , the survival fractions are not independent of each other and _ vice versa _",
    ", if the survival fractions are multiplicative , the dose becomes non additive @xcite .",
    "so , other biophysical properties of radiation tissue interaction need to be taken into account in order to perform a meaningful composition .",
    "let us suppose several radiation events occur so separate in time that physical consequences of one of them are independent from the others . in other words ,",
    "survival probabilities for individual radiation doses are independent .",
    "the survival fraction should then be the product of partial fractions , and for the whole treatment , @xmath26 where @xmath27 runs along the radiation sessions .    however , if the radiation doses occur simultaneously , _ i.e. _ as coming from different beams and concurrent in the same point of tissue , the radiation dose must be additive and the total survival fraction follows , @xmath28    in order to deal with a real treatment new generalized sum and product operations need to be introduced .",
    "notice that it is possible to write as a product , finding the expression that turns @xmath29 after @xmath30 fractions into @xmath29 after @xmath17 fractions .",
    "so , expression can be written as , @xmath31 this expression can be interpreted as a modified in which the denominator , which plays the role of the annihilation dose , gets reduced , in practice , by an amount @xmath32 after addition of the @xmath27-th fraction . on the other hand , for independent fractions this critical dose remains constant along the treatment .",
    "let us introduce a new nonextensive sum , @xmath33 , and product , @xmath34 , operators consistently defined to hold , @xmath35 subject to the condition @xmath36 , for @xmath37 .",
    "then , the coefficient @xmath38 $ ] relates equations and such that @xmath39 implies radiation fractions are completely correlated while @xmath40 means they are fully independent . according to both limits interpretation",
    ", @xmath41 values will depend on the time between fractions and also on tissue repair or recovery capabilities .",
    "a single radiation fraction with an effective dimensionless dose @xmath42 equal to the whole fractionated treatment can be found such that , @xmath43 after the @xmath27-th fraction , the dimensionless effective dose becomes , @xmath44 assuming @xmath45 . when the @xmath17-th fraction is given , then @xmath46 .",
    "all fractionated treatments sharing the same value of @xmath42 will provide the same value for the survival fraction .",
    "so , the same @xmath42 will provide the isoeffect criterion for the fractionated therapy .    in order to check the model reliability ,",
    "it has been fitted to data from @xcite using a weighted least squares algorithm .",
    "those data sets are considered as a reliable source of clinical parameters ( as the @xmath47 relation of lq model @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in figure [ fig : isoeffects - fits ] .",
    "isoeffect relationship data reported for mouse lung by @xcite ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , mouse skin by @xcite ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) and mouse jejunal crypt cells by @xcite ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , fitted to our model.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the obtained @xmath41 coefficients show a survival fraction behavior far from the pure @xmath7-algebraic limits ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "since @xmath41 values for usual tissue reaction differ from limiting values , it is worth to further study the biophysical interpretation of this new parameter .",
    "isoeffect curves for mouse jejunal crypt cells by @xcite .",
    "curves are calculated based on fitted parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 for different @xmath42 values of our model , shown for every plot.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    every @xmath42 value provides a different isoeffect relationship , as shown in figure [ fig : isoeffects - explain ] . once the involved coefficients for a treatment ( @xmath41 and @xmath0 ) are known it can be tuned to obtain the desired effective dose by changing @xmath17 and @xmath2 .      assuming the same physical dose per fraction , @xmath4 ,",
    "as is the case in many radiotherapy protocols , expression becomes a recursive map , describing the behavior of the effective dose in a treatment . for a given @xmath41",
    "there is a critical value of @xmath4 , @xmath55 dividing the plane @xmath56 in two different regions ( see figure [ fig : nmap ] ) . for a treatment with @xmath57 , there will always be a surviving portion of the tissue since always @xmath58 .",
    "however , if @xmath59 , after enough fractions @xmath60 , meaning that effective dose has reached the critical value and every single cell of tissue has been removed by the treatment . then it is possible to find @xmath61 , the threshold value of @xmath17 , that kills every cell , for a given therapy protocol .",
    "this is shown in the inset of figure [ fig : nmap ] .",
    "the larger plot represents @xmath61 isolines as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath41 ( dashed lines ) above @xmath62 ( solid line ) ; below this line , killing all tissue cells is impossible .",
    "the small one represents critical values @xmath61 in terms of @xmath63.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    if the desired result is the elimination of the radiated tissue cells , _",
    "i.e. _ surrounding tissue is not a concern for treatment planning , @xmath61 represents the minimum number of sessions needed to achieve this goal ; any session after that will be unnecessary . on the contrary , if the therapy goal requires the conservation of tissue cells ( for instance in order to preserve an organ ) , then the number of sessions must be lower than @xmath61 .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 is a cornerstone on isoeffect relationships .",
    "a fractionated therapy of fully independent fractions requires a greater radiation dose per fraction , or more fractions , in order to reach the same isoeffect as a treatment with more correlated fractions .",
    "the @xmath41 coefficient acts here as a relaxation term .",
    "immediately after radiation damage occurs ( @xmath39 ) tissue begins to recover , as @xmath41 decreases , until the tissue eventually reaches its initial radiation response capacity ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "in other words , the formerly applied radiation results in a decrease of the annihilation dose ( initially equal to @xmath0 ) describing the effect of the next fraction . the more correlated a fraction is to the previous one , the larger the value of @xmath41 and , thus , the larger the effect on the critical dose will be . notice that unlike @xmath64 , that characterizes the tissue primary response to radiation , @xmath41 characterizes the tissue trend to recover its previous radioresistance .",
    "correlation between fractions can be translated in terms of the late and acute tissue effects of radiobiology . indeed",
    ", damaged tissue repairing and recovering capabilities should determine the value of @xmath41 .",
    "given a dosage protocol , an early responding tissue would correspond to @xmath41 close to @xmath65 , whereas late responding tissue , would have @xmath41 closer to @xmath66 . notice that in current working models for hyperfractionated therapies this repair and recovery effects are introduced as empirical correction factors @xcite , as will be required for @xmath41 .    as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "nonextensivity properties of tissue response to radiation for single doses are more noticeable for higher doses than predicted by current models . on the contrary ,",
    "a lower dose per fraction brought out nonextensive properties for fractionated therapies .",
    "indeed , for high dosage a few fractions are applied in a treatment and a change in @xmath17 is not required for different @xmath41 values . however , in the lower dosage case , more radiation fractions need to be applied and the @xmath41 parameter may become crucial . in this case",
    "@xmath17 values move away from each other for isoeffect treatments with different @xmath41 .",
    "so , in order to achieve the desired therapy effects , fractionated radiotherapy must be planned for a tissue described by @xmath64 , varying @xmath4 according to @xmath41 .",
    "this @xmath41 coefficient should be experimentally studied as its value tunes the annihilation dose along a radiotherapy protocol .",
    "for some radiation treatments as brachytherapy the irradiation is applied in a single session but for a prolonged period of time .",
    "if the discrete irradiation sessions were close enough could be written as , @xmath67 in continuous irradiation the effective dose is in general small , and is possible to assume @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "then , @xmath70,\\label{eq : dotxmix}\\ ] ] where the terms of second order in @xmath42 and above have been neglected .",
    "it is obvious from dose additivity properties that in the continuous irradiation case and for two time instants @xmath71 and @xmath72 close enough , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the dose rate per unit time .",
    "however if both instants of time are far enough to make relevant the tissue recovering capabilities this expression becomes invalid .",
    "so , whereas a usual integration process could become valid in a short time period this is not true for longer intervals .",
    "so , in a similar way as was already done for the sum operation , a new definition for integration must be introduced .",
    "this can be done following @xcite and introducing the @xmath7-algebraic sum and difference , @xmath75 in those terms , a nonextensive derivative operation follows such that , @xmath76 then we can define the physical dose rate , @xmath74 , as the nonextensive time derivative of the equivalent dose ,    @xmath77    expression can be rewritten as a standard ode , @xmath78 which can be solved in the usual way taking into account that @xmath79 and @xmath74 are in general functions of time . due to the applied radiation ( @xmath74 ) the applied effective dose increases linearly .",
    "however a resistance force ( @xmath80 ) , that depends not only on tissue recovering characteristics but also on the dose rate and the effective dose itself , is slowing down this increase .    in order to show behavior ,",
    "let us suppose @xmath74 is constant ( a common case in clinical practice ) and @xmath79 slowly varying in time , so that it can be also taken as a constant .",
    "then it is straightforwardly obtained , @xmath81 allowing to find the needed irradiation time to kill every cell in the tissue ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath83 and showing that effective dose increases at a decreasing speed , @xmath84 until tissue cells get annihilated at time @xmath85 ( @xmath82 ) . under continuous irradiation ,",
    "survival fraction decreases faster at the beginning of irradiation process .",
    "however , depending on dose rate and @xmath79 coefficient , the killing process speed slows down until eventually every cell is killed .",
    "if the recovery capacity is very high ( @xmath86 ) the radiation effects stack slowly and there will always be surviving tissue cells ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "those radiation damages stack faster as long as tissue cells are less capable to repair it and if there is no repair processes at all ( @xmath88 ) the effective radiation dose grows linearly in time and cells get killed faster ( @xmath89 ) . this time shortening behavior with decreasing repairing rate is also shown by other radiobiological models @xcite .    comparing and we see that , in the limit of continuous dosage , they become the same expression with @xmath90 .",
    "however this relation may become invalid at high exposures as effective dose becomes larger and @xmath91 gets closer to @xmath66 . at this point ,",
    "the fractionated and continuous treatments differ .",
    "so @xmath79 must be studied regardless of @xmath41 but if a continuous alternative therapy is desired , known @xmath41 values can be a good starting point to find @xmath79 .",
    "the use of tsallis entropy and the second law of thermodynamics have allowed us to write a simple nonextensive expression for the single dose survival fraction .",
    "the mathematical constraints , required to define the probabilities composition such that the two limiting behaviors are described , introduce a new parameter , relating the radiation sessions .",
    "the fits to available experimental data show that usual treatment have non trivial values of this parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ , are not close to the limiting behaviors .",
    "this make the study of this coefficient relevant for clinical treatments and experimental setups .",
    "the existence of a critical dosage arises from these composition rules , providing a criterion to adjust a treatment to kill every tumor cell or minimize the damage over healthy tissue .",
    "this could be reached changing the number of sessions or the radiation dose by session , allowing to switch between isoeffective treatments .",
    "also an expression for the effective dose in continuous irradiation treatments has been found , showing it is phenomenologically linked to the previous one .",
    "this has the potential to provide isoeffect relationships in continuous dose treatments such as brachytherapy .",
    "besides , a relation between fractionated and continuous therapies could be established from the obtained coefficients .",
