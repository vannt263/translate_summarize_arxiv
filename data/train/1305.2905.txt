    "there are reactions whose properties can be described in terms of effective interactions .",
    "such interactions allow to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in comparison with direct calculations and thus considerably simplify the problem of finding the cross sections .",
    "one of the clearest examples in particle physics is the vector meson dominance model .",
    "the cross sections of high - energy photon interactions with nucleons and nuclei were observed to resemble that of purely hadronic reactions but smaller by about a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "relying on this observation it was assumed that the photon in @xmath2 reactions transforms into a vector meson @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and then interact with the target , so that the @xmath2 reactions effectively proceed as hadron ",
    "hadron ones .",
    "another example is provided by the regge theory which reproduces a number of properties of hadron ",
    "hadron scattering by assuming that the hadrons interact with each other through the exchange of a family of particles called reggeons .",
    "the present paper shows that the energy dependence of the ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutrino  nucleon scattering cross sections can be reproduced if one assumes that the uhe neutrinos effectively interact with the nucleons through excitations of leptoquarks in neutrino",
    " quark subprocesses .",
    "the standard model , within which the uhe neutrino  nucleon scattering cross sections are traditionally calculated  @xcite , is only consistent because of the remarkable cancellation between the quark and lepton contributions to triangle anomalies of gauged currents .",
    "this strongly suggests that in a more fundamental theory leptons and quarks should be interrelated  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems not so unusual that at ultra - high energies the standard model may reflect some properties of this fundamental theory and the leptoquarks may manifest themselves in uhe neutrino interactions .",
    "numerous theories lead to the possibility of quark  lepton interactions mediated by bosons called leptoquarks  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this paper is based on the buchmller ",
    "rckl  wyler ( brw ) leptoquark model  @xcite .",
    "leptoquarks in different reactions including those initiated by neutrinos have been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "experimental searches for leptoquarks have been carried out in @xmath6  @xcite , @xmath7  @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the most stringent limits to date on the first generation scalar and vector leptoquark masses are obtained by the h1 collaboration at hera in @xmath7 collisions . for couplings corresponding to the leptoquark",
    "lepton vertex @xmath10 , first generation leptoquarks with masses up to 800 gev are excluded at 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "limits on the scalar leptoquarks independent on @xmath11 are placed by the cms collaboration according to which masses below 640 gev and 650 gev are excluded , respectively for the first and second generation leptoquarks  @xcite .",
    "if the branching fraction of the leptoquark decay into a charged lepton and a quark is equal to unity , these limits increase to 830 gev and 840 gev , respectively .",
    "the ( charged current , neutral current , total ) cross section for deeply inelastic neutrino  nucleon scattering at neutrino energies @xmath12  gev in the laboratory reference frame show a power rise with @xmath13 and is described by expressions of the following form  @xcite :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the center - of - mass energy squared , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are positive constants . typically @xmath18 and its particular value depends on the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) of the nucleon used in the evaluation of the cross section .",
    "on the other hand , the quark densities in the nucleon at small bjorken  @xmath19 relevant for the considered deep inelastic regime can be parametrized as  @xcite    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are some constants .",
    "next - to - leading ( nlo ) order fits of pdfs at @xmath23 indicate that the parameter @xmath22 is of the order of  0.3 for @xmath24  gev@xmath25 and varies slowly with increasing @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the ranges of variation of @xmath27 and @xmath22 substantially overlap .",
    "this fact is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where @xmath27 from a series of papers is compared with @xmath22 obtained by using different pdf sets at @xmath28  gev@xmath25 .",

    "the effects of the @xmath26-evolution of the quark distributions induce corrections of only about 20%  @xcite .",
    "then , performing the integration over @xmath26 in  ( [ sm_cross ] ) under the approximation that one neglects the @xmath26-evolution yields  @xcite @xmath31,\\label{sm_cross2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 and the quark distribution functions are evaluated at some fixed scale . from  ( [ sm_cross2 ] )",
    "one can see that the power - type behavior @xmath33 of the quark distributions translates into a power - type rise with energy @xmath34 .",
    "in addition to the standard picture of neutrino interactions , the necessity of the equivalence between @xmath27 and @xmath22 and the power law behavior of the cross section  ( [ cross_1 ] ) naturally stem from a model within which uhe neutrino ",
    "nucleon scattering proceeds effectively through excitations of brw - like leptoquarks coupling to neutrino ",
    "quark pairs as well as to charged lepton  quark pairs .",
    "this mechanism is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "the following subprocesses allowed by the brw model can contribute to uhe @xmath35 scattering :    @xmath36    @xmath37    here @xmath38 ( the top quark distribution in the nucleon is neglected ) and @xmath39 ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand for scalar and vector leptoquarks , respectively ; the numbers in the brackets are the electric charges of the leptoquarks .",
    "the cross section for each subprocess reads  @xcite :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the total energy squared of the neutrino  quark collision , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mass and spin of the leptoquark , respectively , @xmath46 is the dirac delta function , @xmath47 is the width of the decay @xmath48 . the indices @xmath49 correspond to the subprocesses  ( [ sub1 ] ) and @xmath50 correspond to  ( [ sub2 ] ) .",
    "henceforth we take @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in the considered deep inelastic regime",
    "it is fair to put @xmath53 .",
    "then , convoluting  ( [ narrow ] ) with the quark densities parametrized in the form of  ( [ pdf ] ) yields    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 if uhe neutrino ",
    "nucleon scattering proceeds through the subprocesses  ( [ sub1 ] ) ; @xmath57 and @xmath58 if uhe neutrino ",
    "nucleon scattering proceeds through the subprocesses  ( [ sub2 ] ) .",
    "one can see from  ( [ cross_sec2 ] ) that our model reproduces the power rise of the cross section as @xmath59 and thus explains the observation @xmath60 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the presented model allows to evaluate the mass of the leptoquark in a way independent on its spin and electric charge .",
    "since @xmath22 depends on the momentum transfer squared @xmath26  @xcite ( in our case @xmath61 ) , the leptoquark mass will be given by the solution of the following equation :    @xmath62    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one can already conclude that the mass is not far from 1  tev .",
    "we have solved  ( [ equation ] ) graphically at @xmath63 taken from  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . to find the function  @xmath64 we adopted cteq6.6 m parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "this method gives within 17%    @xmath65      another consequence of the discussed model is the possibility to evaluate the leptoquark decay widths .    by demanding    @xmath66    and using  ( [ cross_1 ] ) , ( [ cross_sec2 ] ) and  ( [ equation ] )",
    "one obtains    @xmath67    for instance , @xmath68  gev at @xmath69 gev , @xmath70  cm@xmath25  @xcite , @xmath72  @xcite , @xmath73 ( the value of the parameter @xmath21 is found by using cteq6.6 m  @xcite and corresponds to @xmath72 ) .",
    "the leptoquark resonance turns out to be much wider than the massive gauge bosons of the standard model @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is also obvious that    @xmath76    irrespective of the quantum numbers of the leptoquark through which uhe neutrino ",
    "nucleon scattering proceeds . here",
    "@xmath77 is the width of the channel @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the charged current and neutral current uhe neutrino ",
    "nucleon scattering cross sections .",
    "the standard model calculations show that the ratio  @xmath81 is approximately equal to 2.27 and very weakly depends on @xmath82 in the region @xmath83 gev  @xcite so that @xmath84 .",
    "meanwhile , the brw model predicts @xmath85 .",
    "the leptoquark mass @xmath86 gev predicted by the present analysis is within the mass range experimentally accessible at the cern lhc in leptoquark pair production  @xcite as well as in single leptoquark production through generation of the equivalent lepton flux by the protons  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the latter case in detail .",
    "leptoquarks can be produced singly at the lhc by splitting of photons emitted from the proton beam into lepton pairs .",
    "one of the leptons can then interact with a quark ( antiquark ) from the other proton beam and thereby produce a leptoquark .",
    "this mechanism is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "since the minimal value of @xmath19 probed in this process at the lhc is of the order of 0.01 ( @xmath87 ) , the main contribution to the leptoquark production cross section will be from the valence @xmath88 or @xmath89 quark of the proton .",
    "the brw model allows two possibilities : 1 ) production of an ( @xmath90)-type vector leptoquark through the subprocess @xmath91 ; 2 ) production of an ( @xmath92)-type scalar leptoquark through the subprocess @xmath93 . following  @xcite",
    ", we find the cross sections for single inclusive production of ( @xmath94)-type leptoquarks in @xmath9 collisions valid for order of magnitude estimates :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the fine structure constant , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the masses of the charged lepton and quark , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath99 appears in estimating the proton structure function @xmath100 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the values of the cross sections for both leptoquarks @xmath101 and @xmath102 are close each to other because in the proton @xmath103 , so that for order of magnitude estimates one can take @xmath104 .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] displays the energy dependence of the cross sections for the leptoquark mass @xmath69 gev .",
    "single leptoquark production may be relatively easy to analyze experimentally due to a leptoquark decays into a charged lepton plus a quark . in this case",
    ", the final state has simple topology formed by an identified charged lepton plus jet , both at large transverse momenta ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the main contribution to the background arises from @xmath106 plus jet final states .",
    "unlike leptoquark decays , the transverse momenta of leptons and jets are not balanced in the background events and the latter can be well separated out .",
    "the neutrino decay channels of the leptoquarks can also be exploited but the rejection of the corresponding background @xmath107+jet is a more difficult task since one has to reconstruct the invariant mass from missing momentum and energy  @xcite .    according to the predicted leptoquark decay widths and the cross sections , a singly produced leptoquark will manifest itself at the lhc as a relatively wide resonance with @xmath108 gev residing in the mass range between 1123  gev and 1583  gev . for the energy @xmath109 tev and an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb@xmath110 already reached at the lhc ,",
    "the expected number of leptoquark events with the topologies ( @xmath111 ) and ( @xmath112 ) is @xmath113 and grows to values of the order of @xmath114 for @xmath115 tev at the same luminosity .    in the case of scalar and vector leptoquark pair production through gluon ",
