    ", we give a characterization of this subspace and propose the _ method of orthogonal projection _ which generalizes degroot s method .",
    "it is shown that in the method of orthogonal projection , as well as in degroot s method , no nonbasic agent can affect the final result .    in this paper , we show that the result of any degroot s procedure with a strong communication digraph as well as the result of any procedure of orthogonal projection without nonbasic agents can be represented by degroot s procedure whose communication digraph is a hamiltonian cycle with loops . in this cycle",

    "now we present the results from algebraic graph theory used in this paper .",
    "a longer list of results useful for decentralized control is given in  @xcite .    if the sequence of powers @xmath30 of a stochastic matrix @xmath5 has a limit @xmath31 then where @xmath32 is the normalized matrix of maximum out - forests of the corresponding weighted digraph  @xmath14 ( a corollary of the matrix tree theorem for markov chains  @xcite ) .",

    "this implies that where @xmath40 is the multiplicity of @xmath33 as an eigenvalue of  @xmath34 .",

    "a probability vector @xmath46 is called a _ stationary vector _ of a stochastic matrix @xmath5 if it is a left eigenvector of @xmath5 corresponding to the eigenvalue@xmath42 : @xmath50 .",
    "obviously , this condition is satisfied for the vector @xmath46 in the representation @xmath41 of @xmath31 provided that the convergence of degroot s method is guaranteed by the regularity of  @xmath51    by theorem  3 in @xcite , if for any vector of initial opinions @xmath52 degroot s method converges to the consensus @xmath53 then @xmath46 is a _",

    "note that one of the new applications of degroot s model is information control in social networks  @xcite .",
    "as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section6 ) , the final result of the method of orthogonal projection can be represented by a weight vector  @xmath61 : the inner product of @xmath61 and the vector of initial opinions gives the consensus : @xmath62 .",
    "this is analogous to the representation of the result of a convergent degroot s method : @xmath41 and @xmath63 ( see ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "given a probability vector @xmath43 it is easy to construct a weighted communication digraph generating @xmath46 as the final weight distribution ( the stationary vector of  @xmath5 ) of degroot s method .    in this section , we show that all positive weight distributions on the set of agents opinions are generated by a rather narrow class of digraphs , namely , hamiltonian cycles of the form @xmath64 with loops , where the vertices are denoted by @xmath65    by @xmath66 where @xmath32 is the normalized matrix of maximum out - forests of the weighted digraph  @xmath14 corresponding to  @xmath67 thus , given @xmath43 a necessary and sufficient condition of the fulfilment of @xmath41 is    a hamiltonian cycle is a strong digraph , so its maximum out - forests are precisely spanning out - trees ( see  ) . recall that the normalized matrix of spanning out - trees ( which in this case coincides with  @xmath32 ) is the matrix whose @xmath68-entry is @xmath69 @xmath70 .",
    "adding loops does not change the set of out - trees .",
    "thus , to solve the problem , i.e. , to implement a given probability vector @xmath71 as the final weight distribution of degroot s method with a communication digraph in the form if a hamiltonian cycle with loops , it is sufficient to construct a weighted cycle whose vector @xmath72 is proportional to  @xmath73 indeed , in this case @xmath74 coincides with @xmath43 which guarantees  .",
    "such a cycle can be constructed by means of the following lemma .",
    "[ 250810th2 ] for any positive vector @xmath75 there exists a unique weighted hamiltonian cycle of the form @xmath76 whose vector @xmath77 of total weights of out - trees coincides with  @xmath78 .",
    "the weight of the arc entering vertex @xmath3 in this cycle is @xmath79{\\prod_{i=1}^{n\\phantom{i}}q_i},\\,$ ] @xmath80    the proof of lemma[250810th2 ] is given in the appendix .",
    "now we apply lemma[250810th2 ] to solve our problem .",
    "[ p_picy ] for any positive probability vector @xmath81 there exists a family of weighted hamiltonian cycles of the form @xmath82 with loops such that using each of them as the communication digraph in degroot s method implements the consensus @xmath49 for any vector of initial opinions  @xmath47 .",
    "the weight of the arc entering vertex @xmath3 in such a cycle is proportional to  @xmath83    as stated above , any communication digraph whose vector @xmath84 of the weights of out - trees is proportional to @xmath46 implements @xmath46 as the final weight distribution of degroot s method .",
    "therefore , to prove proposition[p_picy ] , it is sufficient to observe that by lemma[250810th2 ] , a hamiltonian cycle with loops and any given order of visiting vertices can be taken as such a digraph .",
    "the only thing that should be taken care of is that this cycle must be a _ communication _ digraph , i.e. , the matrix @xmath85 ( see ) corresponding to it must be stochastic . since @xmath34 has zero row sums and nonpositive off - diagonal entries , @xmath85 is stochastic if and only if the diagonal entries of @xmath34 are less than or equal to  @xmath86 for a hamiltonian cycle with loops , this condition is satisfied if and only if all its arc weights do not exceed  @xmath86    [ ex_ham2 ]    consider the influence matrix @xmath87 and the corresponding communication digraph ( fig.[f_011211]a , which does not show loops for simplicity ) .",
    "proposition[p_picy ] enables one to construct another communication digraph , in the form of a hamiltonian cycle with loops , that shares the final consensus obtained through degroot s method with the given digraph for any initial opinions .",
    "observe that @xmath5 is regular and its stationary vector is : @xmath88 as stated in section[s_deso ] , @xmath89 now we construct a hamiltonian cycle @xmath90 with loops such that @xmath91 .",
    "proposition[p_picy ] implies that the vector of arc weights indexed by the vertices of @xmath90 can be @xmath92 where @xmath93 taking @xmath94 we obtain @xmath95 in this communication digraph ( which is shown in fig.[f_011211]b ) , loops with weights @xmath96 and @xmath97 must be attached to vertices @xmath42 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "it follows from proposition[250810th2 ] that if the weights of arcs entering each vertex are preserved , then the order of vertices in the cycle can be arbitrary .",
    "in particular , the cycle in fig.[f_011211]c is also suitable .",
    "thus , for each cycle with loops of this type , degroot s method leads to the same final consensus procedure ( determined by the weight distribution ) as for the original communication digraph .    since in proposition[p_picy ]",
    ", @xmath99 is the weight of the original opinion of @xmath19th agent in the final consensus ( the `` influence '' of the @xmath19th agent ) , it is worth noting that for communication digraphs in the form of hamiltonian cycles with loops , this weight is inversely proportional to the weight of the arc entering vertex  @xmath8 thus , in the upshot , the most powerful agent is the one least subject to the influence of the previous agent in the cycle rather than the one maximally affecting the next agent .",
    "finally , proposition[p_picy ] enables one , for any given coordination procedure based on the method of orthogonal projection  @xcite , to construct a degroot algorithm ( with the communication digraph in the form of a hamiltonian cycle ) that leads to the same consensus for any initial opinions .",
    "it is shown that any convergent discrete iterative pooling procedure taking into account the opinions of all agents with positive weights can be approximated ( in terms of achieving the same end result ) by degroot s procedure whose communication digraph is a hamiltonian cycle with loops .",
    "the weight of the arc entering vertex @xmath19 in this cycle is inversely proportional to the influence of agent  @xmath100 while the order of visiting vertices can be arbitrary .    for any vertex in a hamiltonian cycle",
    ", there is exactly one tree outgoing from this vertex .",
    "that tree includes all arcs of the cycle except for the arc entering this vertex .",
    "hence the elements of the vector @xmath72 of total weights of out - trees are given by the equations where @xmath101 is the weight of the arc entering vertex  @xmath102 consequently , @xmath103{\\prod_{i=1}^n\\prod_{j\\ne i}x_j } = \\frac{\\sqrt[n-1]{\\prod_{i=1}^{n\\phantom{i}}t_i}}{t_k},\\quad k=\\1n.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]                              < ?",
