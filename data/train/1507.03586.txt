    "consider a swarm of delay - coupled agents in the plane , with each agent indexed by @xmath0 .",
    "we build an erds - renyi communication network on the swarm as follows .",
    "starting with a globally - coupled network , pick an existing link at random , using a uniform distribution over the existing links , and remove it , until the mean degree matches some target value .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the set of neighbors of agent @xmath0 , that is , the set of agents with which agent @xmath0 shares a communication link .",
    "because of communication / sensing delays , information about the position of the neighboring agents is available with delay @xmath2 , assumed to be the same for all agents . for simplicity , we assume that all agents in the swarm have identical dynamics and that all connections in the network are bidirectional and fixed in time .",
    "the agents have self - propulsion and are attracted to their neighbors with strength that depends on the coupling coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "then the motion of agent @xmath0 is governed by the following equation : @xmath4[eq : agenti ] where superscript @xmath2 is used to denote time delay , so that @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "the first term in the above equations represents the self - propulsion of swarm agents .",
    "the second term models pairwise attraction between each agent and its neighbors in the swarm .",
    "this simplified model does not include short - range repulsion or other collision - avoidance strategies ; however , earlier studies indicate that the collective dynamics of the swarm are not significantly altered by the introduction of short - range repulsion terms @xcite .",
    "we examine the dynamics of the system analytically in the limit where the system is almost completely connected ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of neighbors of node @xmath0 ) , and show via simulations that the approximations made in the almost - connected limit hold closely even as the mean coupling degree is reduced to less than @xmath9 of possible links .",
    "in @xcite we derived the mean - field dynamics of the system in the limit @xmath10 where the delayed coupling was considered to be all - to - all .",
    "the difference considered in the model given by eq .",
    "[ eq : agenti ] is that each agent s motion depends only on its neighbors , rather than all other agents in the swarm .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the position of the center of mass of the swarm , and let @xmath12 ; note that @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the dot product in @xmath15 .",
    "the motion of the center of mass is governed by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of neighbors of agent @xmath0 ( in the globally coupled case , @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is the mean degree of the network .",
    "we denote the mean fraction of missing links by @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 . note",
    "that , if @xmath22 is the same for all @xmath0 , @xmath23 since @xmath24 and in the double summation , each @xmath25 appears @xmath26 times because the network is undirected and each node has @xmath26 neighbors .",
    "however , in our network @xmath27 is drawn from a binomial distribution .",
    "our previous work shows that in many instances either individual deviations from the center of mass are small , or in aggregate they average out over the whole population .",
    "( we discuss situations in which this assumption breaks in a later section ) .",
    "then , neglecting all terms of order @xmath28 and in the limit @xmath10 , the center of mass motion is given approximately by @xmath29    we note that the mean - field dynamics are identical to those for the globally - coupled homogeneous swarm described in @xcite , with coupling constant @xmath3 replaced by an ` effective ' value @xmath30 .",
    "quite remarkably , simulation results indicate that the system exhibits similar collective motions to the globally coupled case , even as @xmath31 is significantly decreased .",
    "these basic collective motion patterns are `` translation '' , where the entire swarm collapses to a point and travels along a straight - line trajectory at constant speed ; `` ring '' motion , where the swarm agents form concentric counter - rotating rings about the stationary center of mass ; and `` rotating '' motion , where the agents collapse to a small volume and collectively rotate about a fixed point .",
    "the collective motions of the swarm and the effects of non - global coupling are described in more detail in the following section .",
    "as in the globally coupled case , the steady - state motions of the swarm depend on values of the coupling coefficient @xmath3 , the delay @xmath2 ; in addition , there is now a dependence on the fraction of missing links @xmath20 .",
    "the collective motion patterns of the swarm for different values of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 are described in more detail below .      in the translating state ,",
    "the agent locations all lie close to the swarm center of mass , and the swarm moves with constant speed and direction . following the calculation in @xcite , it can be shown that the translation speed @xmath32 must satisfy @xmath33 .",
    "the system exhibits a pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath34 , where the translating state disappears .      for all values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , ( [ eq : ddotr ] )",
    "admits a stationary solution , @xmath35 . in this state , the agents converge to a pair of concentric , counter - rotating rings about the stationary center of mass .",
    "the mean radius and angular velocity of the agents in the ring state satisfy @xmath36 respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ringstate ] ) .",
    "the stability of the ring state is determined by the characteristic equation @xmath37 ^ 2\\ ] ] and is lost along hopf bifurcation curves which give rise to a rotating state .",
    "solving for values where roots of @xmath38 cross the imaginary axis , we obtain hopf bifurcation curves in the @xmath3 and @xmath2 plane : @xmath39 @xmath40 . when @xmath41 , we recover the equations for the globally coupled system by taking @xmath42 ; the factor of @xmath43 in @xmath44 which results from breaking a fraction of the links in the global network represents a perturbation from the globally - coupled case ( fig .",

    "all agent positions coincide ; however , when coupling is not global , different agents circle the fixed point with equal angular frequency but have different radii , and have a fixed relative phase offset from the center of mass , depending on their coupling degree ( see fig .",

    "the dynamics of agent @xmath0 becomes @xmath58 so that dynamically , less - than - global coupling in our erds - renyi network is approximately equivalent to a fully connected network of agents with heterogeneous coupling coefficients @xmath59 where the factor of @xmath51 is introduced so that @xmath60 in the fully connected case where @xmath18 . in the limit @xmath10 , we have @xmath61 where the motion of the center of mass @xmath62 is given by ( [ eq : ddotr ] ) .",

    "[ fig : rotex ] ) and our assumption becomes invalid . in this ` arc ' configuration the center of mass of the swarm moves closer towards the center of rotation than theory predicts .",

    "in this paper we have analyzed the collective motion patterns of a swarm with erds - renyi communication network structure , using a mean - field approach from statistical physics , with the assumption that the number of agents goes to infinity .",

    "we showed that behaviors described in @xcite for the globally - coupled swarm , namely translation , ring state , and rotation , persist as communication links are broken , even though the bifurcation curves are shifted as coupling degree of the network decreases .",
    "we derive expressions for the speed of the swarm in the translating state as a function of time delay and coupling coefficient ; for the mean radius and angular velocity of agents in the ring state ; and for the angular velocity , and individual radii and phase offsets for individual agents in the rotating state .",
    "we have verified these calculations with simulations of the full - swarm dynamics .",
    "it is remarkable that our model reduction , which starts with @xmath93 second - order delay - differential equations and yields one equation of the same type , is able to quantitatively capture so many aspects of the full swarm dynamics , even as the coupling degree of agents within the swarm is significantly decreased .    in the case",
    "that many agents are coordinating together , limited communication bandwidth makes all - to - all communication infeasible , and may lead to significant communication delays . by dropping the requirement for all - to - all communication used in our previous work , the current paper brings us one step closer to a possible implementation of swarming control algorithms for very large aggregates of agents .",
    "understanding the natural emerging dynamics of the system in these circumstances allows us to exploit them when designing controls for swarming applications .    in future work",

    "<S> the emergence of complex dynamical behaviors from simple rules of pairwise interaction in aggregates of agents is a remarkable yet widespread phenomenon that appears in a multitude of application domains . in biology , aggregates form at all spatial and temporal scales , from the microscopic ( ex . , aggregates of bacterial cells or the collective motion of skin cells in wound healing ) @xcite to large - scale systems of fish , birds , and even humans @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in control systems , the emerging capabilities of swarms can allow groups of relatively small , inexpensive agents to achieve tasks that are beyond any individual agent . </S>",
    "<S> for example , aggregates of locally interacting agents have been proposed as a means to create scalable sensor arrays for surveillance and exploration @xcite ; distributed sensing @xcite ; cooperative construction @xcite ; and the formation of reconfigurable modal systems @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> many biologically - inspired models are based on `` zones '' of attraction , repulsion , and/or alignment interactions between agents @xcite . setting different ranges for attraction / repulsion interactions between all agents in the swarm or introducing heterogeneous dynamics can lead to interesting behaviors , such as splitting of a large swarm into smaller groups @xcite . swarming with nearest - neighbor alignment </S>",

    "<S> however , some progress has been made in understanding how the structure and parameters of a given swarm model contribute to the aggregate motion of the group . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xcite presents a simulation - based analysis of the different kinds of motion in a fish - schooling model ; the authors map phase transitions between different aggregate behaviors as a function of group size and maximum number of neighbors that influence the motion of each `` fish '' . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the authors use simulations to study transitions in aggregate motions of prey in response to a predator attack .    in this paper , we are motivated by the idea of using a swarm of interacting autonomous aerial robots to conduct surveillance / monitoring of a specified environment , where a human operator uses a high - level control to guide the swarm as a whole ( e.g. , to set the monitoring region ) , while individual agent trajectories are governed by swarm interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is similar to the reduced - order swarm control described in @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to rigorously characterize the swarm motion patterns under a simple but general swarming model , as a function of model parameters , so as to exploit them for parametric control of the system . </S>",

    "<S> systems of interacting individual agents , whether natural and engineered , involve some degree of communication delay @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> time delay can have significant impact on system dynamics , leading to destabilization or synchronization of coupled systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in our earlier work with globally delay - coupled swarms of homogeneous @xcite and heterogeneous agents @xcite , communication delay can cause emergence of new collective motion patterns and , in the presence of noise , lead to switching between bistable patterns ; this , in turn , can lead to instability in robotic swarming systems @xcite .    because global coupling is easier to analyze and a reasonable assumption in cases of high - bandwidth communication and when the number of agents is small </S>",
    "<S> , many models make the mathematically simple but physically implausible assumption that swarms are globally coupled ( that is , each agent is influenced by the motion of all other agents in the swarm ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for large groups of agents , bandwidth restrictions generally mean that it is not feasible to maintain all - to - all communication . in this paper , we generalize our previous results for globally - coupled swarms by assuming an erds - renyi communication network , where the mean number of neighbors for each agent in the swarm is fixed .    </S>",
    "<S> we use mean - field dynamics to analytically predict transitions between regimes of different collective swarm motions as a function of model parameters for swarms consisting of homogeneous delay - coupled agents with a fixed undirected erds - renyi communication network . </S>",
    "<S> we use a simple yet general particle swarming model , which combines agent self - propulsion and inter - agent attraction . </S>",
    "<S> this choice can be justified in the case of swarming robots with very fast relaxation times , such as quadcopters , which can be treated as holonomic vehicles over the spatio - temporal scales required for a surveillance / monitoring deployment . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the stable motion patterns observed in the globally - coupled system ( translation , ring formation , and rotation about a common center of mass ) @xcite persist under non - global coupling , for appropriately chosen model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our results are verified through numerical simulations . </S>"
