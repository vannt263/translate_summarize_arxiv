    ", the field @xmath8 has four degrees of freedom ( two bosonic and two fermionic ) , and takes values in a target space denoted by @xmath9 , which is a supermanifold extension of the hyperbolic plane @xmath10 .",

    "the last term in the action is needed to break the non - compact symmetry and make the corresponding integral finite , so @xmath15 can be seen as the analog of a magnetic field , or a mass term .",

    "the transfer operator method is used in a non standard way . instead of estimating the top eigenvalue",
    "directly , it is used to bound some of the terms generated by the deformation uniformly in the length of the strip . for this purpose , we need only a reflection symmetry and compactness . to set up a transfer operator we need to express our measure as a product of local functionals .",

    "one might write this determinant in terms of a product of local functions of grassmann ( anticommuting ) variables , but would have to deal with a transfer matrix involving both real and grassmann variables .",
    "in contrast , here we write the determinant as a sum over spanning trees , using the matrix - tree theorem .",
    "then these trees can be described by a set of local variables and the boltzmann weight becomes a product of local non - negative functions .",
