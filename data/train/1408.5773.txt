    "at extreme temperatures and energy density , hadronic matter undergoes a phase transition to partonic phase called as quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "the main goal of heavy - ion collision experiments is to study the qgp by creating such extreme conditions by colliding heavy nuclei at relativistic energies . during the last decade",
    ", there are many heavy - ion collision experiments carried out at sps , rhic and lhc to create and study qgp in the laboratory . global observables like transverse energy ( @xmath0 ) , particle multiplicities ( @xmath1 etc . ) , @xmath2-spectra of the produced particles and their pseudorapidity distributions ( @xmath3 ) , with different colliding species and beam energies provide insight about the dynamics of the system and regarding the formation of qgp @xcite .",
    "it is also proposed that the correlation of mean transverse momentum , @xmath4 and the multiplicity of the produced particles may serve as a probe for the equation of state ( eos ) of hot hadronic matter @xcite . in a thermodynamic description of the produced system , the rapidity density ( @xmath5 ) reflects the entropy and the mean transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) , corresponds to the temperature of the system .",
    "except at the phase transition points , the rapidity density linearly scales with @xmath4 .",
    "if the phase transition is of first order , then the temperature remains constant at the co - existence of the hadron gas and the qgp phase , thereby increasing the entropy density .",
    "in such a scenario , @xmath4 shows a plateau with increase of entropy , thereby characterizing the phase transition associated with the time evolution of the system .",
    "hence , the global observables like , @xmath5 and @xmath4 , give indication of a possible existence of a qgp phase and the order of phase transition .",
    "@xmath6 gives the maximum energy density produced in the collision process which is necessary to understand the reaction dynamics .",
    "the formation of qgp may also change the shape of the pseudorapidity distribution @xcite .",
    "the event multiplicity distribution gives information of the centrality and energy density of the collision .",
    "the scaling of multiplicity with number of participant nucleons ( @xmath7 ) reflects the particle production due to soft processes ( low-@xmath2 ) . whereas , at high energy when hard processes ( high-@xmath2 ) dominate , it is expected that the multiplicity will scale with the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "there are models @xcite to explain the particle production taking a linear combination of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( called two - component model ) .",
    "the most viable way of studying qgp is via the particles produced in the collision in their respective domain of proposed methods .",
    "then one of the most fundamental questions arises about the mechanism of particle production and how they are related with the initial energy density , gluon density in the first stage of the collision evolution and entropy of the system .",
    "similarly , question can be put to figure out the role of soft and hard process of particle productions .",
    "it is proposed that the charged particle multiplicity or technically called as the pseudorapidity density distributions of charged particles , @xmath9 , can be used to address the above questions @xcite . here",
    "the pseudorapidity , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the polar angle , the produced particles make with the detector .",
    "so @xmath12 is called as one of the global variables to characterize the system produced in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "experimentally , it is more easy to estimate this quantity as most of the detectors are capable of detecting charged particles and it involves only kinematics of the charged particles .    in this review , in section - ii , we discuss the method of experimental determination of collision centrality , which is followed by discussions on the midrapidity pseudorapidity density distributions of charged particles for different collision energies , collision species and centralities in section - iii . in this section",
    ", we discuss about the longitudinal scaling and factorization of charged particles .",
    "the expansion dynamics of the system is discussed using the pseudorapidity density distributions of charged particles and the landau - carruthers hydrodynamics . in subsequent subsections , the scaling of total charged particles with collision centrality and its energy dependence",
    "are discussed .",
    "this follows with similar discussions on the photon pseudorapidity density at forward rapidities in section - iv , which includes longitudinal scaling of photons .",
    "subsequently , in section - v , discussions are made on the production of transverse energy and its use for centrality determination .",
    "section - vi includes discussions on collision energy dependence of transverse energy , which is followed by discussions on the centrality dependence in section - vii . section",
    "- viii includes discussions on estimation of initial energy density in bjorken hydrodynamic scenario , and its energy and centrality dependences .",
    "further we correlate the energy and centrality dependence of transverse energy per charged particle with chemical freeze - out criteria in section - ix . in section -",
    "x , we summarize the review with conclusions .",
    "appendix discusses on the important properties of gamma and negative binomial distributions .",
    "in heavy - ion collisions , the event centrality is of utmost importance to understand the underlying physics of the collision .",
    "the event centrality is related to the impact parameter , defined as the distance between the centroids of the two colliding nuclei in a plane transverse to the beam axis , of the collision .",
    "the impact parameter tells about the overlap volume of the two nuclei .",
    "this overlap volume determines the geometrical parameters , like number of participant nucleons ( @xmath13 ) , number of spectator nucleons ( @xmath14 ) and the number of binary collisions ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the impact parameter can not be determined experimentally .",
    "however , the global observables , like total charged particles ( @xmath16 ) , transverse energy ( @xmath17 ) or energy deposited in zdc ( @xmath18 ) etc . , are related to this geometrical quantity . by combining the experimental observables with simulation",
    ", one can estimate the impact parameter and hence , the centrality of the event class .",
    "the centrality is expressed as the percentile ( @xmath19 ) of the total hadronic interaction cross section corresponding to the charged particle multiplicity above certain threshold and is given by , @xmath20 in eq ( 1 ) , @xmath21 is the total nuclear interaction cross section of a+a collision . assuming constant luminosity , the cross section can be replaced by the number of observed events after the trigger efficiency correction .",
    "but at very high energy , when these two nuclei pass by each other , there is a large qed cross section because of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "this qed cross section is much larger than the hadronic cross section and this contaminates the most peripheral events .",
    "that is why the centrality determination is restricted to some percentile where the qed contribution is negligible .",
    "the fraction of hadronic events excluded by such cut as well as the trigger efficiency can be estimated by using a glauber model simulation .    for a given impact parameter , the @xmath13 and @xmath15 can be estimated by glauber monte carlo method .",
    "the parametrized negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) can be used to describe the nucleon - nucleon collisions . for heavy - ion collisions , @xmath13 and @xmath15",
    "are used to generate the number of charged particles by incorporating two - component model in the following way : @xmath22 this @xmath23 refers to the `` independent emitting source '' . the two - component model given in eq ( 2 )",
    "incorporates the soft and hard interactions .",
    "soft process is related to the @xmath13 and hard process is related to @xmath15 .    the functional form of nbd distribution is given by , @xmath24 eq ( 3 ) represents the probability of measuring @xmath25 hits per ancestor .",
    "here , @xmath26 represents the mean multiplicity per ancestor and @xmath27 controls the width of the distribution . in @xmath28 ) collision , a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) with a fixed value of @xmath26 and @xmath27 well describes the charged particle multiplicity data . the charged particle multiplicity for nucleus - nucleus collisions with a given impact parameter is generated by sampling @xmath23 times the @xmath29 multiplicity , which is generated by using nbd .",
    "finally , a @xmath30 minimisation is done by fitting the glauber monte carlo generated multiplicity and the charged particle multiplicity obtained from the collision data .",
    "the @xmath30 minimization will give us the value of @xmath31 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this gives a connection between an experimental observable and a glauber monte carlo . from this",
    "one can have access to @xmath13 and @xmath15 for a given class of centrality by nbd - glauber fit .",
    "for example , the centrality determination in alice using v0 amplitude is given in figure [ centrality ] .",
    "the two component model is fitted with the v0 amplitude in figure [ centrality ] to find out the @xmath13 and @xmath15 values for a corresponding centrality @xcite .",

    "it is observed from figure [ dnchdetacucu ] , [ dnchdetaauau ] and [ dnchdetapbpb ] that the distribution is symmetric around @xmath43 = 0 .",
    "it is also found that with the increase of collision energy , the width and amplitude of the @xmath44 increase .",
    "similarly , width of the central plateau region also increases with increase of energy .",
    "moreover , the plateau region converts into a dip for pb+pb collisions at @xmath32=2.76 tev as shown in figure [ dnchdetapbpb ] .",
    "this can be addressed by the particles compositions which is directly related to the chemistry of the qgp .",
    "the pseudorapidity distributions of kaon has more dip than pion and proton has more dip than pion and kaons at @xmath43 = 0 .",
    "this is because of the mass of the particles . in other way ,",
    "heavier is the particles , the more is the dip in its pseudorapidity distribution . in the mean time , the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles show that the total proton+anti - proton production cross section is higher at lhc than at rhic @xcite . that explains the dip observed for the pb+pb collisions at lhc energy .",
    "the multiplicity distribution at lhc can be well described by the double gaussian function as follows @xcite , @xmath45 it is reported in ref @xcite that the values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are same within the errors for each measured centrality bin . to test this",
    "whether it is valid for other systems and energies , we tried to fit this double gaussian function to other multiplicity distributions of au+au and cu+cu systems measured at @xmath32= 200 and 130 gev . to check the consistency",
    ", we considered @xmath9 distributions of three centralities : 0 - 6@xmath49 , 6 - 15@xmath49 and 15 - 25@xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath30 of the fitting , the fitting parameters @xmath50 , the ratio of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are given in table [ fitvalue1 ] , [ fitvalue2 ] and [ fitvalue3 ] .",
    "it can be seen from the tabulated values that the values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are same within the errors for different centralities at a particular energy . hence , this observation for rhic energies agree with the observation made at lhc energy .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ dnchdetacucu ] , [ dnchdetaauau ] and [ dnchdetapbpb ] that with increase of energy , the width of pseudorapidity distribution increases .",
    "this can be related to the longitudinal flow and velocity of sound of the system ( @xmath51 ) using landau hydrodynamic model .",

    "this observable is known as global barometric measure of the internal pressure in the ultra - dense matter produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this quantity depends on the initial state of the collision and the viscosity of the matter as it expands to its final state , when it is observed by the detectors .",
    "this observable when studied as a function of collision energy ( as shown in figure [ etech ] and the values are given in table [ table - excitation ] ) , shows three regions of interest .",
    "the first one from the lower sis energies to sps energies shows a steep increase of @xmath58 values , thereby indicating that the mean energy of the system increases ( at midrapidity , @xmath59 ) . in the second region , from sps to top rhic energy , @xmath58 shows a very weak collision energy dependence , i.e. like a saturation behaviour . in this region the mean energy",
    "does nt increase , whereas the collision energy increases .",
    "this may indicate that the increase in collision energy results in new particle production in this energy domain , which is consistent with higher particle multiplicity observed at these energies .",
    "this behaviour has been well described in the context of a statistical hadron gas model ( shgm ) @xcite . in the framework of shgm",
    ", it has been predicted that @xmath58 would saturate at energies higher to that of top rhic energy with a limiting value of 0.83 gev @xcite . here a static fireball is assumed at the freeze - out .",
    "however , a value of @xmath60 gev is observed at the lhc 2.76 tev center of mass energy recently , by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "this creates a third region in the excitation function of @xmath58 , showing a jump from top rhic to lhc energies . in this region , along with particle multiplicity , the mean energy per particle also increases , which needs to be understood from theoretical models taking the dynamics of the time evolution of the created fireball .",
    "it is however , observed that models based on final state gluon saturation ( cgc like ) seems to explain this behaviour in the excitation function of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the rhic beam energy scan ( bes ) data seem to follow the overall trend of the collision energy dependence of @xmath58 .",
    "it has been seen in one of the previous works of one of us ( rs ) @xcite that various freeze - out criteria like constant energy per particle ( @xmath61 gev ) @xcite , fixed baryon+anti - baryon density ( @xmath62 ) @xcite , fixed entropy density per @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) @xcite seem to describe the qualitative energy dependent behaviour of @xmath58 quite consistently upto rhic energies . as shown in the figure , a hybrid function which is a combination of logarithmic and power law in center of mass energy , seems to describe the data quite well . at very high energies , the creation and annihilation of gluons balances out leading to gluon saturation . in the framework of gluon saturation models , the high energy behaviour of this observable",
    "is well described @xcite .",
    "figure [ etechcent ] ( upper panel ) shows the centrality dependence of @xmath58 from @xmath65 = 7.7 gev to 2.76 tev energy .",
    "these data are enlisted in table [ table - etcent ] .",
    "since the centrality definitions by the cms experiment for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are different , fitting the centrality dependent @xmath66 by a function , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we have evaluated the @xmath66 values corresponding to the @xmath13 values used to define the centrality classes for @xmath67 .",
    "then we have estimated the lhc values of @xmath58 at different centralities , which are given in table [ table - etcent ] and are shown in figure [ etechcent ] . within the systematic errors , @xmath58 for all energies upto top rhic energy , show a weak centrality dependence with a modest increase from most peripheral collisions to @xmath71 , reaching a roughly constant value of around @xmath72 gev towards central collisions .",
    "the lhc data also show a similar behaviour but the constant value of @xmath58 is around 1.25 gev .",
    "this centrality dependence of @xmath58 is shown to be equivalent to the behaviour of @xmath73 as a function of centrality for top rhic energy @xcite and for @xmath74 tev @xcite at lhc .",
    "this is shown in the lower panel of figure [ etechcent ] .",
    "the value of @xmath75 gev / c at @xmath74 tev , which is almost 36% increase when compared with its value ( @xmath76 gev / c ) at top rhic energy @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath58 increases almost @xmath77 from top rhic to lhc energy .",
    "this shows that not only particle multiplicity increases while going from top rhic to lhc energy , the @xmath73 also increases , making a third region in the excitation function of @xmath58 .",
    "the near centrality independent behaviour of @xmath58 is explained by statistical hadron gas model ( shgm ) with a static fireball approximation at freeze - out @xcite .",
    "however , to explain the energy dependent behaviour of @xmath58 in the whole range of energies upto lhc , one needs to consider the dynamical effects during the time evolution of fireball .",
    "irrespective of the collisions species , the center of mass energies and the collision centrality , starting from the lower energies to top rhic energy , the system evolves to the same final state , which could be characterized by a constancy in chemical freeze - out temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "lhc data shows a different trend of @xmath58 , while the chemical freeze - out temperature does nt change that much from rhic to lhc .",
    "this needs to be understood from the thermodynamics point of view @xcite .",
    "a theoretical description of the time evolution of the produced fireball in heavy - ion collisions is difficult , as it involves different degrees of freedoms at different points .",
    "the shgm uses hadronic degrees of freedom at later times , when the chemical composition of the matter is frozen ( known as chemical freeze - out ) .",
    "then the particles mean free path becomes higher than the system size , which forbids the elastic collision of the constituents and the system is said to be kinetically frozen ( known as thermal or kinetic freeze - out ) .",
    "in general , freeze - out could be a complicated process involving duration in time and a hierarchy where different types of particles and reactions switch - off at different times .",
    "this gives to the concept of _  differential freeze - out \" _ . from kinetic arguments",
    ", it is expected that reactions with lower cross - sections switch - off at higher densities / temperature compared to reactions with higher cross - sections .",
    "hence , the chemical freeze - out , which corresponds to inelastic reactions occurs earlier in time compared to the kinetic freeze - out , which corresponds to elastic reactions . in accordance with the above discussions , one can think of strange or charmed particles decoupling from the system earlier than the lighter hadrons .",
    "a series of freeze - outs could be thought of corresponding to particular reaction channels @xcite . however , in general one focuses on chemical and kinetic freeze - outs , considering the freeze - out to be an instantaneous process . at higher energies ,",
    "when @xmath78 , the transverse energy production is mainly due to the meson content of the system .",
    "the experimental observations go in line with the above fact , when we observe the ratio of @xmath79 at higher energies @xcite .",
    "the intersection points of lines of constant @xmath58 and the freeze - out line give the values of @xmath58 at the chemical freeze - out @xcite .     and",

    "pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles is proposed to be one of the important global observables to characterize the hot and dense medium produced in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we reviewed the charged particle and photon multiplicity density distribution results obtained by various heavy - ion collision experiments starting from ags energies to top rhic and lhc energies . before going to the results , a brief introduction on determination of centrality",
    "centrality determination is important in terms of relating theoretical observables , like impact parameters and numbers of nucleon participant ( @xmath13 ) , to the collision geometry and observed particle multiplicity . to correlate them ,",
    "for example , two - component model with nbd is fitted with the v0 amplitude and the centrality percentile is evaluated to classify the events into different centralities . in the mean time the respective @xmath13 , @xmath15 and impact parameters are estimated by monte carlo glauber model .",
    "the @xmath9 spectra are discussed for cu+cu , au+au and pb+pb collisions at different energies .",
    "it is observed that the width and amplitude of the distribution increases with increase of collision energy . a double - gaussian function is fitted with the distribution and it is found that the ratio of amplitudes , the widths are similar from one centrality to other in their respective collision energy .",
    "more interestingly that more dip in the mid rapidity is observed in pb+pb collisions at @xmath32= 2.76 tev .",
    "this is an indication of different hadro - chemistry at lhc energy than rhic .",
    "still this needs to be understood in details .",
    "similarly , the energy dependence of @xmath81 of cu+cu , au+au , s+au and pb+pb collisions are discussed .",
    "then the limiting fragmentation behaviour of charged particles as well as photons are discussed for cu+cu , au+au and pb+pb collisions at different energies .",
    "the compilation of various experimental data go in line with the hypothesis of limiting fragmentation .",
    "moreover , after observing the centrality dependence of longitudinal scaling of charged particles , @xmath82 is used to confirm the scaling behaviour and the scaling seems to be valid for a wide range of energies .",
    "in contrast to charged particles , photons do not show any centrality dependence .",
    "it is interpreted as majority of photons in the forward rapidities are coming form @xmath83 decays .",
    "hence , mesons are not affected by baryon stopping as they are originated from valence quarks . cgc model has successfully explained the limiting fragmentation upto some extent .",
    "however , it needs more development and complete understanding of the final state effect and inclusion of quark distribution .",
    "this longitudinal scaling of hadrons still needs more insight to understand the physics process and its predicted violation at lhc energies in the frame work of shgm and the validity from experimental data are to be understood from theoretical considerations .    during the discussion of factorization",

    "similarly , photons at rhic energies also obey the landau hydrodynamics .",
    "it is observed that the @xmath84 normalized to @xmath13 scales with centrality .",
    "it is to be noted here that in the midrapidity , @xmath9 normalized to @xmath13 does nt scale with centrality , whereas the total charged particles do .",
    "this is because of the modification of charged particles at forward rapidities are strongly correlated with compensating changes at midrapidity .",
    "@xmath81 also shows similar scaling .",
    "it is found that trapezoidal rule can be used to explain the @xmath84 normalized to participant pair from ags energies to rhic energies .",
    "however , it fails at lhc energy .",
    "when a hybrid function constructed by adding the power law and logarithmic of @xmath32 , it explains the whole range of data indicating that the charged particle production is a combined process of midrapidity gluonic source ( power law ) and fragmentation process ( logarithmic ) .",

    "<S> we review the charged particle and photon multiplicity , and transverse energy production in heavy - ion collisions starting from few gev to tev energies . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results of pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles and photons at different collision energies and centralities are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the hypothesis of limiting fragmentation and expansion dynamics using the landau hydrodynamics and the underlying physics . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , we present the estimation of initial energy density multiplied with formation time as a function of different collision energies and centralities . in the end , the transverse energy per charged particle in connection with the chemical freeze - out criteria is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we invoke various models and phenomenological arguments to interpret and characterize the fireball created in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this review overall provides a scope to understand the heavy - ion collision data and a possible formation of a deconfined phase of partons via the global observables like charged particles , photons and the transverse energy measurement . </S>"
