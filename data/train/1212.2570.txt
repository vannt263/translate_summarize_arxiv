    "to describe the growth kinetics of adsorbates on surfaces , knowledge of diffusion coefficients of atoms and molecules on the surface is of vital importance .",
    "different experimental techniques can be utilized to measure corresponding diffusion coefficients .",
    "two of the first methods were field emission microscopy@xcite and field ionization microscopy.@xcite another technique is the laser induced thermal desorption,@xcite where first an area of adparticles is cleared by desorption and then the successive repopulation measured by desorption . for scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) several modes of operation have been described : taking scans of the surface with the adsorbed particles at different time instants to identify individual particle displacements,@xcite recording current signals in time with a locally fixed stm tip,@xcite and coupling the tip to a single adsorbate and tracking its motions.@xcite different procedures to extract diffusion coefficients from these and other techniques have been reviewed by barth in 2000.@xcite    analysis of island densities with predictions from rate equations for submonolayer growth kinetics is a further powerful method , @xcite which allows one also to determine binding energies between adatoms or of adatoms to small clusters .",
    "an extension of this method to multi - component systems is given in refs .  .",
    "in recent years the self - assembly of organic molecules on surfaces has attracted much attention in connection with the idea of developing electronic devices on a molecular level.@xcite molecules in organic surface growth often have high mobilities and sizes large compared to the lattice constant of the substrate .",
    "in this situation not all techniques are equally well suited .",
    "a convenient and powerful method is the recording of temporal current fluctuations with a fixed scanning tunneling microscope tip@xcite or , in principle , of signal fluctuations from any locally fixed microscopic or other probe.@xcite for example , for molecules on insulating substrates , the frequency or height fluctuations in an atomic force microscopy could be used .    in order to extract diffusion coefficients from signal fluctuations of a probe , a theoretical basis for",
    "the analysis of the measurement is necessary .",
    "one approach was developed for the auto - correlation function ( acf ) of an stm signal @xcite and applied , on the basis of the corresponding power spectrum , to oxygen atom diffusion on si(111),@xcite and more recently to hydrogen atom diffusion on si(111).@xcite another approach was followed in ref .   by analyzing the distribution of peak widths in the signal , which correspond to residence times of single molecules under an stm tip .",
    "we will refer to it as the residence time distribution ( rtd ) method in the following . for determining absolute values of diffusion coefficients ,",
    "a general problem is that the theoretical modeling involves a commonly not precisely known `` detection function '' with some finite range .",
    "however , when the extension of the diffusing molecules is larger than the detection range , this problem becomes essentially irrelevant and the size of the molecule enters as the relevant length scale .    in this work we first revisit both the acf and the rtd method .",
    "for the acf method we study , as a new aspect , modifications implied by the finite size of molecules and for the rtd method we give a detailed account of the functional form of the rtd in different time regimes . in the rtd , time intervals",
    "are considered where the molecule is under ( or very close to ) the tip .",
    "corresponding time intervals are also included in the calculation of the acf .",
    "it can therefore not be precluded that the interaction of the molecule with the tip is influencing the results .",
    "a possible influence can be evaluated systematically by changing the bias voltage,@xcite or the distance between tip and substrate . in order to ensure that the influence is small independent of adjustments , we develop a further method , which is based on the analysis of the distribution of peak - to - peak distances in the signal .",
    "this method is referred to as the interpeak time distribution ( it d ) method in the following .",
    "all three methods are applied to diffusion measurements of copper phthalocyanine ( cupc ) on the ag(100 ) surface previously reported in ref .  .",
    "we discuss advantages and disadvantages of the three procedures mentioned above and a possible combination of them , which enables us to improve the quality of results for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we consider @xmath0 molecules diffusing on a flat substrate area @xmath1 and a probing tip of an stm placed at a fixed position above the surface .",
    "the lateral tip position is chosen as the origin of an @xmath2-@xmath3-coordinate system on the surface .",
    "each diffusing molecule @xmath4 with its center at position @xmath5 gives a contribution @xmath6 to the total tunneling current @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the `` detection function '' .",
    "we regard the molecules as non - interacting , which should be a valid assumption at low concentrations @xmath9 , or more precisely on time scales smaller than @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mean intermolecular distance and @xmath12 the number density of molecules .",
    "the autocorrelation function @xmath13 of the current fluctuations @xmath14 can then be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the two - dimensional diffusion propagator @xmath17    to provide a quantitative prediction for @xmath18 , knowledge of the detection function @xmath8 is necessary .",
    "for the stm this requires a detailed treatment of the tunneling problem , which is a long - standing problem since the first pioneering work by tersoff and hamann .",
    "@xcite based on a simple approach , sumetskii and kornyshev @xcite suggested a gaussian detection function for small particles ( adatoms ) as a result of the tunneling barrier .",
    "for extended molecules , the lateral structure of the electronic charge density needs to be taken into account .",
    "in fact , without referring to first - principle calculations for the specific system under consideration , it is difficult to obtain accurate expressions for the tunneling current .    while such more detailed treatments are interesting in themselves , they are not really required for determining the diffusion coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "a more practical approach is to transform @xmath20 into a rectangular signal @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the heaviside jump function ( @xmath23 for @xmath24 and zero else ) , and @xmath25 is a threshold current to exclude background noise . if we consider situations , where at most one molecule can be in the detection region under the tip , each single molecule contribution @xmath26 to @xmath27 also transforms to a rectangular signal @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "accordingly , the detection function can be defined as `` indicator function '' of the molecule @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the set of center positions of the molecule which give rise to a tunneling current @xmath32 . to get a description that is independent of details of the molecule s shape , we assign a circle to the set @xmath31 .",
    "the radius @xmath33 of this circle can , for example , be determined by setting the covered area of the molecule equal to @xmath34 , by the gyration radius of the set @xmath31 , or by some other reasonable requirement .",

    "a disadvantage is that only the short - time regime @xmath148 is governed by single particle diffusion , while an accurate theoretical description of the crossover to the long - time regime , governed by collective particle diffusion , requires a careful consideration of the mutual exclusion of the molecules ( and possibly other interaction effects ) .",
    "the decay of the correlation function within this regime can be small , which then affects the accuracy of the @xmath19 values resulting from the fitting .",
    "another drawback is that the determination of the acf includes time intervals where molecules are under the tip and possible interactions with the tip can thus have an influence on the diffusion properties .",
    "both the rtd and it d method require some more effort in preparation of the data , which is connected to the determination of the threshold current @xmath25 and identification of the peaks .",
    "once @xmath25 is set , both the peak widths and interpeak distances can be extracted simultaneously .",
    "note that any method of determining @xmath25 is associated with some uncertainty .",
    "for the it d this is no problem in practice , because the interpeak intervals are comparatively large .",
    "we have checked that , when taking the interpeak distances as time intervals between peak maxima , the results do not change significantly . for the rtd",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath25 is a more severe problem . because molecules diffuse slowly into the detection area , the peaks in the original tunneling current signal have rather flat flanks . as a result",
    "the peak widths change more sensitively with @xmath25 than the interpeak intervals .",
    "an advantage of the rtd is that @xmath19 can be determined solely by analyzing the exponential tail for large residence times .",
    "one should note , however , that it may be difficult to obtain a good statistics in the tail regime , when the molecules are highly mobile or small . in this case the peaks are narrow and it could be difficult to resolve them accurately . in the rtd method",
    "the interaction with the tip can influence the residence times and in this case one would not determine the free diffusion of the molecules on the substrate . by systematically changing the bias voltage ,",
    "a possible influence can be reduced to a minimum.@xcite a strength of the rtd is that it is related to a single - particle problem .",
    "the it d method has the advantage that tip - molecule interactions can be expected to have , if at all , a marginal influence on the interpeak times ( irrespective of tip - substrate distances or bias voltages ) . for small interpeak times ,",
    "the it d is essentially also related to a single - particle problem . for large interpeak times , an approximate value of @xmath19 can be obtained based on an estimate for processes , where one molecule in the detection area under the tip is followed by another molecule .",
    "the values obtained in this way turn out to be close to those resulting from the other methods . compared to the residence times ,",
    "the interpeak times are quite large and are thus less prone to the experimental time resolution and the threshold value @xmath25 .",
    "in order to exploit the strength of each method one can combine the different methods , if the corresponding data in the relevant time regime have sufficient statistics . for a first classification of the measurement it is helpful to choose the acf method , because it yields fast results without analyzing the time series in detail . in a subsequent step",
    "the peak widths and interpeak intervals should be extracted with the procedure described in sec .",
    "[ sec : acf ] .",
    "we then recommend to use the rtd method for determining @xmath19 whenever the exponential tail is sufficiently pronounced and the tip influence on the diffusion can be neglected .",
    "otherwise the it d method should be preferred . in any case",
    ", one should always apply both the rtd and the it d method to perform consistency checks and to obtain most reliable results .",
    "our analysis for cupc on ag(100 ) shows that , despite diffusion coefficients extracted from the different methods may differ for one or another sample , the activation energies determined from the arrhenius plots should have comparable values , see fig .",
    "[ fig : arrhenius ] .",
    "an interesting question is whether the methods discussed here can be taken over to other fields .",
    "obviously , the acf method is well known in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs),@xcite where intensity fluctuations reflect concentration fluctuations , typically in some finite detection volume .",
    "similarly , analysis of density fluctuations has been applied as one variant to determine diffusion coefficients in field emission microscopy.@xcite in the situation discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : acf ] only one particle is in the detection area and accordingly information on the tagged particle diffusion ( tracer diffusion ) is obtained . in the hypothetical limit of very small particle concentrations in fcs , where the mean interparticle distance becomes larger than the linear size of the detection volume , one should essentially recover the behavior discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : acf ] ( with @xmath33 then playing the role of the detection length ) . in common applications of this method one is , however , not able to extract the tagged particle information and this makes a difference to the acf method discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : acf ] .",
    "this also prevents the use of the rtd and it d in the analysis of typical fluorescence signals .",
    "these methods can yet become useful in light of the ongoing development of sophisticated techniques to measure single - molecule properties .",

    "so far , we have considered circular shapes for planar molecules . the situation will evidently be more involved when rectangular or even more complicated shapes are considered .",
    "in addition rotational diffusion and anisotropies induced by the substrate then can modify the results .",
    "as mentioned above , the interaction of the stm tip with the diffusing molecule was neglected so far .",
    "the interaction is influenced by the experimental setup ( tip shape , tip - substrate distance etc . ) and it is specific for the tip and molecule material .",
    "one objective could be to minimize the tip influence experimentally .",
    "on the other hand , it could be interesting to study how the interaction potential affects the diffusion of the molecule .",
    "this potential has so far not been included in the analysis , but it should be possible and bears an interesting route to obtain information on the tip - molecule interaction .",

    "( [ eq : pitd ] ) by using the heaviside method.@xcite we give a straightforward derivation here , using separation of variables and eigenfunction expansions .",
    "let us first consider the equation for diffusion of a particle in a circular stripe @xmath153 ( @xmath141 here not equal to the lattice constant used in the main text ) with absorbing boundaries and initial distribution @xmath154 due to the radial symmetry @xmath155 , where @xmath156 satisfies the radial diffusion equation @xmath157 with @xmath158 and @xmath159 .    making the product ansatz @xmath160 , eq .",

    "one obtains @xmath162 , where the allowed values for @xmath163 are the eigenvalues of the radial laplace operator in the circular stripe , @xmath164 because the laplacian is negative definite , @xmath165 .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath166 are given by linear combinations of the zeroth order bessel functions @xmath167 and @xmath168 of first and second kind , @xmath169 ( where restriction to @xmath170 gives linear independent eigenfunctions ) .",
    "the dirichlet boundary conditions yield @xmath171 [ or @xmath172 , and @xmath173 as determining equation for the @xmath174 , @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) . introducing the cross product @xmath177",
    "the solution becomes @xmath178 where @xmath179 .",
    "utilizing the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions , @xmath180 the expansion coefficients @xmath181 follow from the initial condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : a.1 ] ) : @xmath182 the result for @xmath79 thus is @xmath183 the diffusion propagator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pitd ] ) relevant for the it d corresponds to the limit @xmath184 , where the spectrum of eigenvalues determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : a.4 ] ) becomes continuous .",

    "( [ eq : pxyt ] ) relevant for the rtd only one boundary condition @xmath193 has to be taken into account . in this case",
    "the bessel functions of second kind cease to apply , because their logarithmic singularity at the origin eliminates them from the space of functions , where the radial laplace operator is hermitean .",
    "notice that the logarithmic singularity would be no problem with respect of the integrability of @xmath79 .",
    "the eigenfunctions thus are given by @xmath194 , where the @xmath174 are determined by @xmath195 .",
