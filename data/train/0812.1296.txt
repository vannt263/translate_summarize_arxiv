    "a feature of governance in several countries with parliamentary elections  typically british commonwealth countries and britain itself  is that two major parties move in and out of power every few elections , while a smaller third party either has never or rarely governed .",
    "this lack of representation of the minority party occurs even though its vote fraction can be close to that of the major parties .",
    "governance is determined by the party ( or coalition ) that has the majority of members of parliament ( mps ) .",
    "each mp is the candidate with the most votes in each parliamentary district election .",
    "this voting system makes it difficult for a minor party to gain representation that mirrors its vote fraction .",
    "for example , if one party ( out of three ) receives 30% of the vote in every district while the other two parties equally share the remaining 70% , then the minority party will have no mps although it is supported by nearly 1 in 3 voters . as an illustration @xcite ,",
    "in the 1983 british election , the conservative party won 42.4% of the popular vote and 397 seats ( 61.1% of 650 seats ) , the labor party won 27.6% of the vote and 209 seats ( 32.2% of 650 ) , while the traditional third - place liberal party won 25.4% of the vote but only 23 seats ( 3.56% of 650 ) .",
    "similarly , canada had two major parties for much of the @xmath0 century  liberals ( center - left ) , progressive conservatives ( center - right ) , and a smaller , but still national scale , new democratic party ( leftist ) that has never governed @xcite .     agents and",
    "parameter @xmath1 ( see text for definition of @xmath2).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=31.0%]0.2 in   agents and parameter @xmath1 ( see text for definition of @xmath2).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=29.5%]0.2 in   agents and parameter @xmath1 ( see text for definition of @xmath2).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=31.0% ]    to understand how such a voting pattern can arise , consider the case of the traditional minority liberal party in britain . if their election fortunes seem promising , then supporters are likely to be galvanized to vote for their party . however ,",
    "if liberal prospects seem bleak and the diametrically opposed conservative party appears strong , a liberal may vote for the labor party to forestall the conservatives .",
    "this strategy clearly disfavors the minority party ( fig .",
    "[ elections ] ) .",
    "in fact , when the number of parties is larger than two , ambiguous outcomes for the voting preference , such as the condorcet paradox @xcite , can easily arise .",
    "there is also a richer range of phenomenology than in two - party voting @xcite .    to account for the endemic weakness of a minority party",
    ", we introduce the `` strategic '' voter model that encapsulates the strategic / ideological dichotomy outlined above .",
    "the original voter model  @xcite is a paradigmatic non - equilibrium process that describes ordering in non - equilibrium systems and consensus in opinion dynamics  @xcite . in the voter model",
    ", agents are endowed with a 2-state opinion variable .",
    "the dynamics is defined by picking a voter at random and updating its opinion and repeating _ ad infinitum_. in the update event , the agent adopts the opinion of a random neighbor .",
    "neighbors can be defined on a complete graph ( interaction with any other agent equiprobably ) , across the links of regular lattices  @xcite or complex networks  @xcite , or on adaptive graphs  @xcite .",
    "various extensions of the dynamics itself have been considered @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we define two natural versions of strategic voting and determine their dynamics in the mean - field limit .",
    "typically , the population is driven to a steady state where a single party is perpetually in the minority unless the strategic bias is extremely weak . in the symmetric - breaking steady state ,",
    "discrete fluctuations ultimately cause the minority party to escape its minority status on a slow time scale .",
    "it appears possible that election results ( fig .",
    "[ elections ] ) would exhibit these same oscillations if the data continued for a much longer time period .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath3 voters on a complete graph that have three possible opinions states : @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the idealized complete graph is used because of its simplicity and analytical tractability .",
    "each of these states is equivalent , in contrast to real political parties , and our model thus does not incorporate any subjective political attributes .",
    "we denote the fractions of the three types of voters as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the state of each individual evolves by the following voter - like dynamics :    * with rate @xmath10 , a voter spontaneously changes to another state equiprobably .",
    "this thermalization step ensures that consensus is never reached . * with rate @xmath11 ,",
    "a random pair of voters in states @xmath12 and @xmath13 is picked and one member of this pair adopts the state of the other voter . in general , @xmath11 does not equal @xmath14 ( see below ) .    in the mean - field limit ( @xmath15 ) , the fractions of each voter species evolve according to the rate equations : @xmath16 the terms proportional to @xmath10 account for spontaneous opinion changes , while the remaining terms account for voter - like updating . in the classic voter model @xcite",
    ", each @xmath17 , because a voter pair @xmath18 can change to @xmath19 or to @xmath20 equiprobably ; thus the density of each species is conserved . in our model , we only require @xmath21 to conserve the total density .    for the strategic voter model , we take @xmath22 to be nonzero when one of @xmath23 or @xmath24 denotes a minority state .",
    "a simple choice is a strategic bias that is independent of the fractions of each species , _ viz _ : @xmath25 ( and cyclic permutations for @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus if @xmath5 is in the minority , then an @xmath28 interaction favors the outcome @xmath29 rather than @xmath30 because @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath4 is in the minority , an @xmath28 interaction favors @xmath30 rather than @xmath29 .",
    "if neither @xmath4 or @xmath5 are in the minority , then they undergo conventional voter dynamics in which their average densities do not change .",
    "while it would be politically more realistic to have non - symmetric interactions in which the minority species has a definite preference for one of the two non - minority species , this more complicated model does not yield any additional insights about strategic voting .    in the @xmath33 sector of the composition triangle ( where @xmath9 is in the minority , see fig .",
    "[ triangle ] ) , the rate equations reduce to : @xmath34 here we use @xmath35 to simplify the @xmath10-dependent terms and the last term in the equation for @xmath36 .",
    "similar equations hold for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 sectors by cyclic permutations .",
    "we will also study a more realistic strategic voting in which the strategic bias vanishes as the minority population approaches those of the other two states . in terms of election sentiment ,",
    "if a minority party supporter believes that his / her party will win in an upcoming election , then there is every reason to vote ideologically with the party and not strategically . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case where the strategic bias varies linearly in the depth of minority status as quantified by the density - dependent strategic voting rate @xmath39 $ ] in eqs .",
    "( the @xmath40 sector ) , and analogously for the other sectors of the composition triangle .",
    "for a strategic bias with a fixed rate @xmath41 , we solve the last of eqs .   by rewriting it in the factorized form @xmath42 here @xmath43 quantifies the relative importance of the strategic bias ( with strong bias corresponding to small @xmath44 ) , and @xmath45\\equiv   \\frac{1}{2}\\left[(1 + 3x)\\pm\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right].\\ ] ] we now apply a partial fraction expansion to eq .   to render it integrable by elementary means and the solution is @xmath46 thus @xmath47 converges to its steady - state value of @xmath48 exponentially in time .",

    "it is clear that the stable fixed point value is @xmath48 for @xmath81 . in this case , any initial state in the @xmath33 sector flows to the fixed point @xmath82 ; this behavior is qualitatively similar to that of constant strategic bias .",

    "in a finite population , the stochasticity of the dynamics allows the system to eventually escape the basin of attraction of a fixed point .",

    "the fixed points in the rate equation then correspond , for finite @xmath3 , to an effective attractor for the probability distribution .",
    "because of finite - size fluctuations , the system can escape such a potential well and thereby move between different attractors .",
    "this barrier crossing corresponds to a change in the identity of the minority party .",
    "we can investigate this barrier crossing by rephrasing it as a first - passage problem  @xcite . following a standard calculation ( as given , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we find that changes in the identity of the minority party occur on a time scale that grows exponentially in @xmath3  @xcite , much longer than the time scale of fluctuations between the majority and second - place parties .",
    "we have tested this prediction by numerical simulations .",
    "the time span over which a given state is in the minority as a function of the total population @xmath3 does appear to grow exponentially with @xmath3 for both constant and state - dependent strategic bias , but with a much smaller amplitude for the latter case ( fig .",
    "[ t - vs - n ] ) . for the more realistic case of a state - dependent strategic bias , simulations of single realizations exhibit changes in minority status on a time scale that can be tuned to be in a similar range as that of election data ( fig .",
    "[ elections ] ) .",
    "we proposed a strategic voter model to describe the feature whereby two major parties dominate in certain parliamentary democracies , while a third party remains in the minority .",
    "our model is based on a strategic bias that inherently disfavors the minority species .",
    "we studied two variants of strategic voting in which the strategic bias is either fixed or state dependent . for fixed bias , the minority species is doomed to remain eternally in the minority in the rate equation limit . for a state - dependent bias , a bifurcation occurs between a stable minority and equal densities of the three parties as the strength of the strategic bias varies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our three - choice voting model has an important distinction with predator - prey models that exhibit `` competitive exclusion '' . this feature",
    " known as gause s law @xcite  states that two species that compete for the same resources can not stably coexist if other ecological factors are constant . in our model , if we consider the opinions as different species , the dynamics allow for spontaneous mutations and additionally the interactions are not constant but state dependent .",
    "these features allow for a stable coexistence of all species .    for finite populations ,",
    "stochastic fluctuations allow the minority party to escape its status on a time scale that grows exponentially with population size .",
    "the concomitant slow oscillations in the identity of the minority party can be readily seen in simulations , and this time evolution seems to roughly mirror real election data , especially if the latter could be extended over a much longer time scale .",
    "however , to quantitatively match the election data , it would be necessary to have a strategic bias that is still weaker than our state - dependent strategic voter model to reproduce both the density difference between majority and minority and the time scale for a change in minority status .",
