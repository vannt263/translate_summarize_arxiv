    "systematic investigation of elliptic event anisotropies can shed light on our knowledge of the equation of state and properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions . using a fourier decomposition of the azimuthal distribution of emitted particles with respect to the event plane angle ( @xmath4 ) the elliptic anisotropy is quantified by the second fourier coefficient @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however an estimate of the event plane , _ a priori _ unknown , and dispersion corrections have to be performed @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique @xcite circumventing these difficulties is to extract @xmath0 from the pair - wise azimuthal distribution of the emitted particles since the correlation of particles with the event plane induces correlations among particles into which @xmath0 enters quadratically .",
    "both methods are sensitive to various non - flow effects @xcite and one of our aims here is to investigate contributions of semihard processes .",
    "a large data set of 42@xmath510@xmath6 @xmath7pb@xmath8au collisions at 158 agev / c was taken by ceres in 1996 at the top 30@xmath9 of the geometric cross section .",
    "@xmath10the experiment with its full azimuthal acceptance is well suited to study azimuthal anisotropies of charged particles and high-@xmath1 pions .",
    "charged particles are reconstructed combining the information from two silicon drift detectors ( sdd ) and a mwpc placed behind the magnetic field .",
    "pions with @xmath114.5  gev / c are visible in the rich detectors ( @xmath12 ) and distinguished from electrons by a non - asymptotic ring radius .",
    "the sdd detectors are used for the event plane measurement by dividing the azimuthal acceptance into 100 samples arranged in 4 groups .",
    "@xmath7the non - uniformities in the @xmath13-distribution caused by dead regions in the detectors , beam and geometrical offsets are removed by standard correction procedures @xcite .",
    "@xmath7the correction factors for the event plane dispersion go from 3 to 6 depending on centrality .",
    "elliptic anisotropy of charged particles and high-@xmath1 pions obtained from the event plane analysis has been extensively studied as a function of centrality and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 is decreasing with centrality ( fig.[v2nch ] ) .",

    "the onset of saturation is clearly visible in the combined data of hadrons and pions in fig.[v2-ceres - na49 ] , which were corrected for hbt effects @xcite calculated with input from @xcite .",

    "the ratio @xmath17 in the semicentral collisions is 1.39@xmath180.07 averaged over the differential points ( fig.[v2-rp - cor]b ) , which is significant compared to a downward correction due to hbt of @xmath1910@xmath9 ( not applied ) .    assuming the non - flow contribution is due to an additional physics process ( e.g. resonance decays , semihard scattering ) the data were fitted by two gaussians at @xmath20=0 , @xmath21 sitting on top of the flow - modulated background ( fig.[2partcor ] ) .",
    "the widths of the gaussian peaks and their centrality dependence are different .",
    "the back - to - back peak is broader than the near - angle peak and its width increases with centrality ( fig.[yield - broadening]a ) whereas the near - angle peak retains its width .",

    "an explanation by minijet production @xcite is suggested by @xmath27 indicative of semihard rescatterings , @xmath28 as expected for fragmentation , and the scaling of the absolute @xmath29 yield with @xmath22 .",
    "the presented results on elliptic event anisotropies of charged particles and high-@xmath1 pions cover a wide range of @xmath1 and show a saturation behaviour around @xmath14  2  gev / c .",
