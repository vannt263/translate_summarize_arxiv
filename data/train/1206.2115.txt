    "most young stars are found in dense molecular cores  @xcite . there is a large volume of data concerning dense molecular cores traced by dust emission and dust extinction  @xcite .",
    "one of the primary outcomes of these studies is the core mass function ( cmf ) . because of the still unknown physical origin of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and its significance",
    ", emphasis has been placed on the possible connection between the cmf and the imf  @xcite .",
    "the construction of an analytic form of the cmf from observational data has largely focused on two functional forms , power law and log - normal .",
    "the majority of past studies claim to find a power law cmf , the shape of which resembles the salpeter imf  @xcite ( the upper mass limit of the original salpeter imf is @xmath6 ) @xmath7 such a power law cmf was found in millimeter continuum maps of the @xmath8 ophiuchus region by @xcite with the iram 30-meter telescope and a series of subsequent studies in the serpens region @xcite , the @xmath8 ophiuchus region @xcite , ngc 7538 @xcite , m17 @xcite , orion @xcite and the pipe nebula @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the cmf in 11 star - forming regions and find an average power law index of @xmath9 . recently",
    ", dust emission observations of the aquila rift complex with _ herschel _ reveal a power law mass function with @xmath10 , for @xmath11  @xcite , which is also consistent with the salpeter imf .",
    "a similar power law index is found in some molecular emission studies .",
    "for example , the cmf obtained from a @xmath12 study in the s140 region has @xmath13  @xcite . on the other hand , there are also studies that find a flatter cmf .",
    "@xcite studied seven molecular clouds l1457 , mcld 126.6 + 24.5 , ngc 1499 sw , orion b south , s140 , m17 sw , and ngc 7538 in @xmath0co and c@xmath14o , and find @xmath15 to be between 0.6 and 0.8 .",
    "@xcite studied cores in the orion molecular cloud traced by sub - millimeter continuum and found a power law with @xmath16 .",
    "these findings of small @xmath15 are in the minority and do not seem to be a special result of spectroscopic mapping . @xcite obtained the cmf from an extinction map and used complementary c@xmath14o observations to examine the effects of blending of cores in dust maps .",
    "they claimed to find a cmf with @xmath15 similar to that of the salpeter imf .    at a first glance",
    ", a similarity between the cmf and salpeter imf suggests a constant star formation efficiency , which is independent of the core mass .",
    "it is crucial to note , however , these studies are examining structures on vastly different scales of size , mass , and density . in @xcite , for example , the mass of the cores ranges from about 0.1 @xmath17 to @xmath18 . due to the large distances of many targeted regions , any `` cores '' over about 500  are certainly unresolved , with many showing signs of much evolved star formation , such as water masers @xcite and/or compact hii regions @xcite .",
    "the observed similarity between cmf and salpeter imf may be explained equally well by self - similar cloud structures as well as a constant star formation efficiency .    some observations ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "suggest a log - normal form for the cmf ( in the mass range of @xmath19 ) , @xmath20\\lp   \\label{lognormal}\\ ] ] this is reminiscent of the @xcite imf , which is also of log - normal form .",
    "theoretically , if the core mass depends on @xmath21 quantities which are random variables , the cmf would be log - normal when @xmath21 is large , i.e. , the core formation processes are complicated  @xcite .",
    "this is a result of the central limit theorem .",
    "a log - normal distribution also arises naturally from isothermal turbulence  @xcite .",
    "it is thus of great interest to distinguish the two forms of the cmf and obtain the key parameters associated with each form .",
    "@xcite show that a large sample with many cores is needed to differentiate these two forms .",
    "furthermore , we also emphasize here the critical need to obtain a large sample of cores in spectroscopic data .",
    "overlapping cores along the same line of sight can only be separated using resolved velocity information .",
    "it is important to evaluate the effect of such accidental alignment on the derived cmf .",
    "a nyquist sampled continuous spectroscopic map is also essential for studying the dynamical characteristics of star forming regions , such as the core velocity dispersion ( cvd @xmath22 see section 4.3 ) , of the whole core sample in one star forming region .",
    "the taurus molecular cloud is a nearby ( with a distance of 140 pc ,  @xcite ) low - mass star - forming region . in this work",
    ", we obtain a sample of cores in the @xmath0co data cube of this region .",
    "we study the properties of @xmath0co cores in detail and compare them with those found in the dust extinction map of the same region .",
    "we first briefly describe the data in  [ sec : data ] ; we present the methods used to find @xmath0co cores in  [ sec : methods ] ; we present the observed @xmath0co cmf and cvd in  [ sec : results ] ; we discuss the implications of our observations in  [ sec : discussion ] . in the final section we present our conclusions .",
    "in this work , we use @xmath23co and @xmath0co data in the form of a ( x , y , v ) cube of the taurus molecular cloud as observed with the 13.7 m fcrao telescope @xcite and the 2mass extinction map of the same region @xcite . the @xmath23co and @xmath0co lines were observed simultaneously between 2003 and 2005 .",

    "the extinction map has a pixel size of about 5 times that of the co data cube with , of course , no velocity information .",

    "cores have been empirically defined as regions with concentrated , enhanced intensity in a data cube or a map .",
    "we empirically assume an ellipsoidal shape for a core and use the findclumps tool in the cupid package , which is a part of the starlink software .",
    "we have tried two methods in the findclumps tool , gaussclumps @xcite and clumpfind @xcite .",
    "gaussclumps searches for an ellipsoid with gaussian density profile around the brightest peak and subsequently subtracts it from the data .",
    "it then continues the process with the core - removed data , iterating successively until a terminating criterion is reached .",
    "clumpfind identifies cores by drawing enclosing contours around intensity peaks without assuming the shape of cores a priori . unlike gaussclumps , clumpfind can not deconvolve overlapping cores .",
    "our subsequent analysis is based on gaussclumps and we discuss the caveats of clumpfind at the end of this section .    for fitted ellipsoids of revolution ,",
    "the core radius is defined as the geometrical mean of the semi - major and the semi - minor axes @xmath31 we take the observed size @xmath32 as a typical scale of a core .",
    "following the instructions for cupid , we first subtract the background by using findback .",
    "some studies of the taurus molecular cloud find a characteristic length scale of about @xmath33 , at which self - similarity breaks down and gravity becomes important @xcite .",
    "this length scale corresponds roughly to @xmath34 pixels in the @xmath0co data cube , and to @xmath35 pixels in the extinction map .",
    "we set the smoothing scale to 127 pixels in each axis for the @xmath0co data cube , and 25 pixels for the extinction map , both are close to the upper value of the scale at which the self - similarity breaks down .",
    "after background subtraction , we use the gaussclumps method of the findclumps tool to fit gaussian components in the @xmath0co data cube , which are identified as @xmath0co cores if their peak intensity is larger than a threshold ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which is set to five times of the rms noise ( parameter rms ) . since the data cube is large , running the 3d - gaussian fitting on the whole data cube is time - consuming . furthermore , the background differs substantially between different parts of the taurus cloud .",
    "the noise level also differs among different regions .",
    "the data cube is divided into several sections in the x - y plane as shown in figure [ fig1 ] to make the sizes of data sets suitable to handle , and to minimize the variation of the background and the noise level .",
    "the fitting parameters are given in table  [ gaussclumpspara ] .",
    "in practice , two adjacent regions are arranged to have an overlapping stripe of 100 pixels in width to avoid the cores touching boundaries being missed . in a final step ,",
    "the resultant catalog is checked and the duplicate cores are removed .",
    "findclumps outputs the total intensity , @xmath36 , through the summation of all pixels in each fitted core .",

    "<S> our data set has a spatial dynamic range ( the ratio of linear map size to the pixel size ) of about 1000 and spectrally resolved velocity information , which together allow a systematic examination of the distribution and dynamic state of @xmath0co cores in a large contiguous region . </S>",
    "<S> we use empirical fit to the co and co@xmath2 ice to correct for depletion of gas - phase co. the @xmath0co core mass function ( @xmath0co cmf ) can be fitted better with a log - normal function than with a power law function . </S>",
    "<S> we also extract cores and calculate the @xmath0co cmf based on the integrated intensity of @xmath0co and the cmf from 2mass . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that there exists core blending , i.e.combined structures that are incoherent in velocity but continuous in column density .    the core velocity dispersion ( cvd ) , which is the variance of the core velocity difference @xmath3 , exhibits a power - law behavior as a function of the apparent separation @xmath4 :   cvd ( km / s ) @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to larson s law for the velocity dispersion of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> the peak velocities of 3co  cores do not deviate from the centroid velocities of the ambient  gas by more than half of the line width . </S>",
    "<S> the low velocity dispersion among cores , the close similarity between cvd and larson s law , and the small separation between core centroid velocities and the ambient gas all suggest that molecular cores condense out of the diffuse gas without additional energy from star formation or significant impact from converging flows . </S>"
