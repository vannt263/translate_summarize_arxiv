    "recently , the investigation of transport properties of normal metal- superconducting ( n / s ) hybrid structures has attracted a considerable interest . in the classical work by blonder , tinkham and",
    "klapwijk@xcite it was shown , that at the energies below the superconducting gap @xmath0 the charge transport can only be realized via the andreev reflection at the n / s interface .",
    "this is a two - particle process in which the electrons with low energies @xmath1 incident from the normal metal ( n ) are reflected at the n / s interface as holes traversing the backward trajectories ( and vice versa ) . in accordance with the charge conservation law , at the superconducting region ( s ) the cooper pairs are formed and the normal current converts into the supercurrent . for the perfectly transparent n / s interface the charge doubling due to andreev reflection results in enhancement of the subgap conductance by a factor of two compared with the corresponding normal state conductance .",
    "being the two - particle process andreev reflection is strongly suppressed due to qp scattering at the layer of insulator separating the n and s regions .",
    "indeed , in case of the small interfactial barrier transparency @xmath2 , the andreev reflection probability , and therefore the conductance is proportional to @xmath3 which is smaller by the factor @xmath4 as compared to the single- electron case .",
    "the phenomenon of subgap conductance suppression results in the remarkable dependence of transport properties of n / s structures on the spatial distribution and symmetry of the superconducting gap .",
    "for example , recently the charge current measurements were utilized for the direct observation of multi vortex structures in mesoscopic superconductors @xcite .",
    "mixed state of mesoscopic superconductors is formed by a small number of vortices and reveals a rich variety of exotic vortex configurations , such as vortex molecules and multiquantum giant vortices , realizing in such samples due to the quantum confinement of the cooper pairs motion  @xcite . in ref .",
    "the phase transitions between different vortex configurations were observed by the multiple - small - tunnel - junction method , in which several small tunnel junctions were attached to the mesoscopic superconductor to simultaneously measure the charge transport at the different points of the sample .",
    "the measured transport characteristics were related to the local density of states ( dos ) , depending on the local supercurrent density and hence on the configuration of the vortex system .",
    "generally , when there is a uniform supercurrent flowing at the superconductor , the excitation spectrum acquires a doppler shift by the value @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a superfluid velocity , @xmath7 is a fermi momentum . in this case , the minimal excitation energy is given by @xmath8 . at large distances from the vortex core ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a coherence length )",
    "the doppler shift model gives quite a good approximation of the quasiparticle ( qp ) spectrum with @xmath11 ( see ref . [ ] ) .",
    "as long as the superfluid velocity is small compared to the critical value @xmath12 the doppler shift of the gap edge results in the reduction of the height and broadening of the superconducting dos peak @xcite .",
    "close to the vortex core ( @xmath13 ) where @xmath14 the gap edge @xmath15 goes to zero .",
    "however , in this case the doppler shift model does not hold : it completely misses one of the remarkable features of the vortex state : the presence of low - energy qp states localized within the vortex core .",
    "these vortex core states were found in the pioneering work by caroli- de gennes and matricon ( cdgm)@xcite within the more rigorous approach based on the quasiclassical solution of bogoliubov- de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "it was shown that qp states with energy lower than the bulk superconducting gap value @xmath0 are localized within the vortex core and have the discrete spectrum @xmath16 as a function of the quantized ( half  integer ) angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "this spectrum of the cdgm states varies from @xmath0 to @xmath18 as @xmath17 changes from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , crossing zero when @xmath17 changes its sign . at small energies",
    "@xmath21 the spectrum is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 for conventional superconductors , the interlevel spacing @xmath25 is much less than the superconducting gap @xmath0 since @xmath26 therefore the cdgm spectrum can be considered continuous as a function of the impact parameter of quasiclassical trajectory @xmath27 the presence of the qp states bounded in the vortex core was confirmed in scanning tunnel spectroscopy ( sts ) experiments by the observation of the zero - bias conductance peak at the vortex core@xcite",
    ". the analogous effect of the zero - bias conductance enhancement due to the resonant tunneling into the midgap surface states was thoroughly studied in high temperature d - wave superconductors@xcite .",
    "the goal of our work is to develop a theory to calculate the zero - bias conductance of n / s junction in case when the external magnetic field generates vortices in the s region near the n / s interface .",
    "we consider the charge transport across the direction of applied magnetic field .",
    "the n and s regions are assumed to be separated by the interfacial barrier , suppressing the andreev reflection and the electron transport .",
    "we predict the strong enhancement of the andreev reflection due to the resonant tunneling of qp through the barrier into the cdgm states localized within the vortex cores .",
    "the essential physics of this effect is analogous to the one which takes place in double - barrier resonant tunneling diode@xcite .",
    "the resonant tunneling in double - barrier quantum well structures occurs if the energy of incident qp wave coincides with the resonant energy , then the reflection probability is effectively suppressed due to the interference of the qp waves within the quantum well . in our case",
    "the quantum well is represented by the vortex core and the bounded low energy qp state consists of coupled electron and hole waves of almost the same amplitude .",
    "therefore , if the incident electron has resonant energy , then the reflected electron wave is suppressed and the hole wave leaking from the vortex core contributes to the andreev reflection probability .",
    "the important difference between our situation and the double- barrier diode case is that the spectrum of bound states is very dense with the characteristic interlevel spacing @xmath28 being much smaller than the bulk energy gap @xmath29 at the same time , the broadening of this levels due to the finite barrier transparency can be estimated as @xmath30 where @xmath4 is the transparency of the interfacial barrier and the factor @xmath31 is due to the exponential decay of subgap qp at the superconducting slab of the thickness @xmath32 which is in fact the distance from the vortex to the n / s interface , @xmath10 is the superconducting coherence length .",
    "hereafter in this paper we will neglect the discreteness of the bound energy levels assuming that @xmath33 in fact this condition is not very restrictive since @xmath34 is large in many superconducting materials , for example @xmath35 in nb and @xmath36 in al . neglecting the discreteness of the spectrum of bounded qp states we can use the quasiclassical approximation of qp quantum mechanics ( see e.g. ref . ) . within such approximation qp move along linear trajectories , i.e. the straight lines along the direction of qp momentum @xmath37 note , that for the n / s point contacts of atomic size in magnetic field it is necessary to take into account the non - quasiclassical divergence of the electron and hole trajectories@xcite . in the present work we consider the transport properties of wide n / s junction so that its transverse dimension @xmath38 is much larger than the fermi wave length @xmath39",
    "therefore the trajectory divergence can be neglected .",
    "also we assume that @xmath38 is much larger than the distance from the vortices to the n / s interface @xmath40 and the characteristic intervortex distance @xmath41 .",
    "the important point is that the total qp reflection probabilities can be found as a sum of individual vortex contributions .",
    "indeed , the intervortex distance is much larger than the fermi wavelength since @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the quasiclassical trajectories ( except those with @xmath44 ) can pass through not more than one vortex core . for some directions of qp momentum two resonant trajectories ( i.e. passing through the vortex cores )",
    "are coupled by the normal reflection at the interfacial barrier . assuming the specularly reflecting barrier this coupling occurs for the momentum angles at the narrow angle domains near @xmath45 where @xmath46 is integer .",
    "the width of the resonant angle domains @xmath47 is determined by the width of the resonant vortex core levels .",
    "therefore , the contribution of such trajectories to the amplitude of the reflected qp waves is negligible",
    ". then , evaluating the amplitude of the qp wave we can separate the resonant trajectories coupled with bounded qp states localized within the different vortex cores . since different trajectories do not interfere with each other , the resulting reflection probabilities and the conductance can be found as a sum of contributions from individual vortices .",
    "the dimensionless conductance ( further we will measure it in terms of the conductance quantum @xmath48 ) induced by a single vortex at zero temperature can be estimated as follows : @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the number of transverse modes of the n / s junction which effectively interact with the qp states bounded within the vortex core ( @xmath10 is the characteristic transverse size of the vortex core ) .",
    "the factor @xmath51 is the one - particle tunneling probability through the barrier consisting of the insulating layer at the n / s interface and the superconducting slab of the thickness @xmath40 .",
    "the total vortex - induced conductance is the sum of the individual vortex contributions @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total number of vortices near the n / s interface , @xmath41 is the intervortex spacing and @xmath38 is the transverse size of the junction . the resonant mechanism of andreev reflection exists along with the usual non - resonant scheme involving the two - particle tunneling through the interfacial barrier with the probability @xmath54 the corresponding zero - bias conductance can be estimated as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total number of transverse modes in n / s junction .",
    "therefore , the total conductance of the n / s junction in magnetic field can be evaluated as follows : @xmath57 where the coefficients @xmath58 .",
    "then , for the strong barrier @xmath59 the conductance induced by the vortex chain with spacing @xmath41 becomes dominant at @xmath60 where the threshold distance @xmath61 can be much larger than the vortex core size and the coherence length .",
    "the parameters of the vortex lattice can be estimated as follows : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the average magnetic field of the superconducting sample and @xmath64 is the flux quantum .",
    "then , the magnetic filed dependence of the vortex - induced second term in eq.([answer0 ] ) conductance is given by : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the upper critical magnetic field of the superconductor .",
    "note , that at zero magnetic field @xmath67 the conductance is @xmath68 and at @xmath69 the conductance is much larger : @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we suggest that if the surface barrier is high @xmath71 it should be possible to observe in experiment the field - induced increase of the conductance according to the eq.([answer ] ) .    in the present work we do not take into account the subgap qp states which exists near the surface of superconductor due to the mejssner screening of external magnetic field@xcite .",
    "such qp levels lie higher at the energy scale than the cdgm states if the density of supercurrent near the surface is less then the critical value . therefore , as long as the zero - bias conductance is considered the influence of the surface qp states can be neglected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ 1 ] a description of the model and the basic equations are given . in sec . [ 2 ] we solve the scattering problem to find the andreev and normal reflection probabilities .",
    "sec . [ 3 ] is devoted to the conductance calculation and sec.[4 ] to the discussion of obtained results .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec . [ 5 ] .",

    "for the sake of simplicity we assume that there is only one quantized qp mode in @xmath73 direction and take into account only the qp motion in @xmath76 plane , perpendicular to the vortex lines .",
    "considering one vortex from the array , the coordinate system is chosen so that the @xmath73 axis coincides with the vortex line and the origin at the @xmath76 plane coincides with vortex phase singularity point . neglecting the suppression of the superconductivity near the n / s interface due to the proximity effect",
    "we assume that at @xmath77 ( superconducting region ) the order parameter can be taken as follows : @xmath78 here @xmath0 is the gap value far from the vortex core , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the dimensionless profile and the phase of the order parameter .",
    "the particular form of @xmath79 is not essential for our consideration , therefore it can be chosen similar to the model profile of the isolated vortex core@xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath10 is the coherence length .",
    "the phase distribution @xmath80 consists of a singular part @xmath82 and a regular part @xmath83 determined by the particular metastable vortex lattice configuration realizing near the boundary .    in principle",
    ", the method developed in the present paper is applicable to the arbitrary order parameter phase distribution corresponding to the metastable vortex configuration . at first",
    ", we solve a generic problem of the influence of a single vortex near the n / s surface on the zero - bias conductance of the junction .",
    "the vortex stability condition given by the london model , requires vanishing regular part of the superfluid velocity at the vortex position : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the vector potential . on the microscopic level",
    ", this condition is necessary for the existence of the cdgm qp states forming the vortex phase singularity@xcite .",
    "the next step is the summation of the individual vortex contributions to the conductance which add independently .",
    "the particular vortex configuration near the boundary depends on many factors , such as the random pinning potential , geometry of the superconducting sample , magnetization history , etc . to estimate the dependence of the conductance on the magnetic field we consider the model situation assuming that the vortices near the boundary of superconductor sit periodically on chain with an intervortex spacing @xmath41 at a distance @xmath40 from the n / s interface .",
    "we take @xmath40 and @xmath41 as external parameters of the order @xmath86 where @xmath63 is the average magnetic field of the superconducting sample .",
    "the influence of the next vortex chains on the conductance can be neglected due to the rapid decay of the qp tunneling probability with the growing distance from vortices to the n / s interface .",
    "the expression for the dimensionless zero- bias conductance of the n / s junction can be written as follows(see ref . ) : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the probabilities of normal and andreev reflection respectively , @xmath75 is the incident angle : @xmath90 .",
    "the total number of propagating modes @xmath91 is determined by the channel width : @xmath92 the problem of qp scattering at the n / s interface is formulated within the bdg theory . the equation for the electron and hole waves coupled by the superconducting gap @xmath93 reads as follows :    @xmath94    here @xmath95 with @xmath96 @xmath97 the interfacial barrier separating the n and s regions is modeled by the repulsive delta potential @xmath98 parameterized by the dimensionless barrier strength @xmath99@xcite .",

    "to overcome the complexity of the scattering problem coming from the broken spatial invariance of the superconducting gap , we treat the eq.([bdg ] ) within quasiclassical approximation .",
    "generally , the quasiclassical form of the wave function can be constructed as follows : @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a slow varying envelope function .",
    "then the system ( [ bdg ] ) reduces to the system of the first - order quasiclassical equations along the linear trajectories defined by the direction of the qp momentum @xmath37 each trajectory is specified by the angle @xmath106 and the impact parameter @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the polar angle : @xmath109 introducing the coordinate along trajectory @xmath110 we arrive at the following form of the quasiclassical equation : @xmath111 with the hamiltonian :    @xmath112    where @xmath113 @xmath114 is the coherence length , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the dimensionless magnitude and phase of the order parameter and @xmath115    considering the zero - bias problem we will have to analyze only the zero - energy excitations with @xmath116 . within the normal metal region at @xmath117 neglecting the influence of magnetic field on the qp motion , the quasiclassical equation ( [ quasiclass ] ) becomes trivial : @xmath118 it means that the envelope function is constant along the trajectories .",

    "for the wave functions @xmath125 decaying at the different ends of the trajectory @xmath126 from eq.([dzita ] ) we obtain : @xmath127    as we will see below , the main contribution to the enhanced andreev reflection probability comes from the trajectories with small impact parameters @xmath128 passing through the vortex core .",
    "for such trajectories neglecting the nonsingular part of the superfluid velocity near the vortex core the analytical solution of eq.([eta ] ) can be obtained following the results of ref .",

    "the boundary conditions ( [ bc],[bc1 ] ) determine the specularly reflecting n / s interface , coupling the waves with wave vectors @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "therefore if the incident electron wave is @xmath136 then reflected electron @xmath137 and hole @xmath138 waves will have the form @xmath139 where and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the envelope functions .",
    "each point @xmath142 at the n / s interface lies on the intersection of two quasiclassical trajectories , characterized by the angles @xmath143 and @xmath144 from the simple trigonometry it is easy to see that the impact parameters of these trajectories are @xmath145 and @xmath146 correspondingly , where @xmath147 is the polar angle .",
    "the coordinate of the intersection point is @xmath148 and @xmath149 for the trajectories characterized by the angles @xmath143 and @xmath150 correspondingly .",
    "then , the reflection probabilities are given by : @xmath151 @xmath152 where the integration is done over the n / s interface , @xmath153 @xmath154 and @xmath155    following the usual procedure , to find the reflected wave amplitudes @xmath156 and @xmath157 one needs to match the n and s regions solutions at the n / s interface . for the envelope functions the boundary conditions ( [ bc],[bc1 ] ) yield :    @xmath158 @xmath159 @xmath160 @xmath161 @xmath162 are arbitrary constants and @xmath163 where @xmath164 are the solutions of eq.([eta ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ tetabc ] ) along the trajectories with @xmath143 and @xmath150 for the upper and lower signs correspondingly .    solving this system we obtain : @xmath165 @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168    note , that for the small impact parameters @xmath169 the factors @xmath170 can be obtained analytically with the help of eq.([etapm ] ) as follows : @xmath171    @xmath172    where @xmath173 for the small angles @xmath174 the equations ( [ eta+ ] ) and ( [ eta- ] ) are valid simultaneously yielding : @xmath175",

    "the factor @xmath3 is determined by the probability of the sequential tunneling of the incident and reflected qp through the high interfacial barrier .",
    "the second term is the total vortex - induced conductance @xmath256 ; it comes from the tunneling of the incident qp into the zero energy cdgm states inside the vortex core .",

    "the influence of impurities can be neglected completely assuming that the life time of the vortex core states due to the finite barrier transparency is much shorter than the relaxation time of the qp momentum : @xmath271 or @xmath272 where @xmath273 is an elastic mean free path of qp at the s region .",
    "this condition certainly can be fulfilled if the barrier transparency is not very high , i.e. @xmath274 and the vortex chain is situated not far from the n / s interface , so that the factor @xmath275 is not very small .",
    "otherwise , if the condition ( [ impurity ] ) is not fulfilled , the impurity scattering will modify the conductance . the simplest approach to estimate the conductance in this situation",
    "is based on the tunneling hamiltonian , yielding the eq.([tunn_hom ] ) for the conductivity . due to the impurity scattering",

    "in particular , the sharp peak at @xmath277 is smeared , therefore at the center of vortex the dos is smaller as compared to the clean case .",
    "but at the distances @xmath278 from the vortex core ( e.g. at the n / s interface ) the dos is not suppressed by the impurities even if @xmath279 . on the contrary , it is even larger than in the clean case due to the smearing of the dos peak at the center of vortex @xcite .",
    "therefore , in case of the rather high impurity concentration on the @xmath280 side the dependence of the vortex -induced conductance on the magnetic field is still described by the eq.([answer ] ) .",
    "another important point is the influence of impurities on the non - resonant part of the conductance , i.e. the first term in eq.([answer0 ] ) . in particular",
    ", the interference of qp waves reflected from the interface barrier and impurities on the n side of the n / s junction can also result in the low - bias conductance enhancement , known as reflectionless tunneling ( see ref . and references therein ) . in experiments where the reflectionless tunneling effect was observed @xcite",
    "the condition @xmath281 was fulfilled . in this case",
    "the critical value of magnetic field suppressing the reflectionless tunneling@xcite @xmath282 was much less than the upper critical field of the superconductor . in our case",
    "the applied magnetic field must be strong enough to create the dense vortex lattice in superconductor : @xmath283 .",
    "therefore , under the same experimental conditions as in ref .",
    "the reflectionless tunneling effect is absent in the range of magnetic fields that we are interested in .",
    "plot of the ratio @xmath225 of the average vortex induced conductivity to the conductivity in the absence of vortices .",

    "to summarize , we have investigated the low - energy charge transport in n / s junction across the direction of applied magnetic field .",
    "we have found the strong enhancement of the zero - bias conductance due to the resonant tunneling of the incident qp into the subgap vortex core states .",
    "the effect is most sound if the conventional channel of andreev reflection is suppressed by the high interfactial barrier .",
    "note that usually , the vortex core states are investigated in sts experiments , where the charge transport is measured along the direction of magnetic field . for the alternative to the sts methods now we can suggest the transport measurements in planar structure with wide - area n / s contacts .",
    "the vortex induced conductance that we have studied depends exponentially on the distance from the vortex chain to the n / s interface and therefore can be effectively controlled by the external magnetic field . also for the possible experimental setup one can consider the mesoscopic superconducting sample with lateral tunneling junctions , such as in ref .. since the vortex -induced conductance is proportional to the number of vortices , the conductance vs magnetic field dependence should reveal pronounced steps marking the switch of the total vorticity of the sample .",
