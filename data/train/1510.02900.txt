    "in combinatorics , a typical problem is to establish algorithms for generating and counting of all objects of a given type .",
    "we are interested in the situation when :     such an algorithm can be described in terms of generating operations , which make possible to build the objects under scrutiny recursively from the objects with lesser number of elements ;     each object can be associated with a number or a monomial in formal variables , in such a way that the generating operations correspond to certain algebraic or differential operations .    as a result",
    ", the set of all objects is mapped into a sequence of numbers or polynomials governed by certain recurrence relations .",
    "a remarkable fact is that in some cases the generating functions for these sequences appear also in the theory of integrable equations .",
    "we mention the relation between the number partitions and statistical mechanics @xcite , the combinatorics of painlev transcendents @xcite , of kdv solitons @xcite and of kp tau - function @xcite , as just few examples of interconnection of both theories .",
    "a well known example , which is more close to the subject of this paper , is given by the bell polynomials which describe the statistics of set partitions and also define the potential burgers hierarchy @xcite .",
    "our goal is to generalize this observation for several special types of set partitions with restrictions on the structure of blocks .    in sections [ s : sp ] , [ s : b ]",
    "we consider the generic set partitions and @xmath0 type partitions related , respectively , with the burgers and ibragimov  shabat linearizable hierarchies .",
    "section [ s : n - seq ] is the only one , where set partitions are replaced by other combinatorial objects ; the corresponding equations are related with the burgers hierarchy by the hodograph transformation . in all these cases",

    ", the combinatorics becomes more complicated , as well as its statistics : the definition of the monomial corresponding to a partition is based on the sequence of operations which bring to this partition , rather than on the size of its blocks .",
    "moreover , the combinatorics becomes more disguised : in the burgers case , the generating function is related intermediately with the higher flows , while in the kdv and nls cases it becomes the asymptotic series in powers of the spectral parameter for the logarithmic derivative of @xmath1-function , governed by riccati equation .",
    "the structure of all sections is uniform : first , we define the generating operations for the combinatorial objects under consideration , next , we introduce the polynomials which describe their statistics and derive the recurrence relations , finally , a comparison with an integrable hierarchy is given .",
