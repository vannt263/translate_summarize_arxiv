    "spreading of opinions , frauds , behavioural patterns , and product adoptions are all examples of social contagion phenomena where collective patterns emerge due to correlated decisions of a large number of individuals . although these choices are personal , they are not independent but potentially driven by several processes such as social influence @xcite , homophily @xcite , and information arriving from external sources like news or mass media @xcite .",
    "social contagion evolves over networks of interconnected individuals , where links associated with social ties transfer influence between peers @xcite .",
    "several earlier studies aimed to identify the dominant mechanisms at play in social contagion processes @xcite .",
    "one key element , termed behavioural threshold by granovetter @xcite , is defined as _",
    "`` the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so''_. following this idea various network models have been introduced @xcite to understand the threshold - driven spreading , commonly known as _ complex contagion _ @xcite .",
    "although these models are related to a larger set of collective dynamics , they are particularly different from _ simple contagion _ where the exposure of nodes is driven by independent contagion stimuli @xcite .",
    "in addition , collective adoption patterns may appear as a consequence of homophilic structural correlations , where connected individuals adopt due to their similar interests and not due to direct social influence .",
    "distinguishing between the effects of social influence and homophily at the individual level remains as a challenge @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in real social spreading phenomena all these mechanisms are arguably present . however , while in the case of homophily the adoption behaviour is only seemingly correlated , and for simple contagion only the number of exposures matters , in complex contagion the fraction of adopting neighbours relative to the total number of partners determines whether a node adopts or not , capturing the natural mechanisms involved in individuals decision makings @xcite . due to this additional complexity ,",
    "threshold models are able to emulate system - wide adoption patterns known as global cascades .",
    "behavioural cascades are rare but potentially stupendous social spreading phenomena , where collective patterns of exposure emerge as a consequence of small initial perturbations .",
    "some examples are the rapid emergence of political and grass - root movements @xcite , fast spreading of information @xcite or behavioural patterns @xcite , etc . the characterisation @xcite and modelling",
    "@xcite of such processes have received plenty of attention and provide some basic understanding of the conditions and structure of empirical and synthetic cascades . however",
    ", these studies commonly fail in addressing the temporal dynamics of the emerging cascades , which may vary considerably between different cases of social contagion .",
    "moreover , they have not answered why real - world cascades can evolve through various dynamic pathways ranging from slow to rapid patterning , especially in systems where the threshold mechanisms play a role and social phenomena spread globally . besides the case of rapid",
    "cascading mentioned above , an example of the other extreme is the propagation of products in social networks @xcite , where adoption evolves gradually even if it is driven by threshold mechanisms and may cover a large fraction of the total population @xcite .",
    "this behaviour characterises the adoption of online services such as facebook , twitter , linkedin and skype ( fig.[fig:1]a ) , since their yearly maximum relative growth of cumulative adoption @xcite ( for definition see material and methods ( mm ) ) is lower than in the case of rapid cascades as suggested e.g. by the watts threshold ( wt ) model .    to fill this gap in the modelling of social diffusion , here we will analyse and model real - world examples of social contagion phenomena .",
    "our aim is to identify the crucial mechanisms necessary to consider in models of complex contagion to match them better with reality , and define a model that incorporates these mechanisms and captures the possible dynamics leading to the emergence of real - world global cascades .",
    "we follow the adoption dynamics of the skype paid service `` buy credit '' for @xmath0 months since 2004 , which evolves over the social network of one of the largest voice over internet providers in the world .",
    "data includes the time of first payment of each user , an individual and conscious action that tracks adoption behaviour .",
    "in addition we follow the  subscription \" service over @xmath1 months since 2008 ( for results see supplementary information [ si ] ) .",
    "in contrast to other empirical studies where incomplete knowledge about the underlying social network leads to unavoidable bias @xcite , we use here the largest connected component of the aggregated free skype service as the underlying structure , where nodes are skype users and links confirmed contacts between them . this is a good approximation since it maps all connections in the skype social network without sampling , and the paid service is only available for individuals already enrolled in the skype network .",
    "the underlying structure is an aggregate from september 2003 to november 2011 ( i.e. over @xmath2 months ) and contains roughly 4.4 billion links and 510 million registered users worldwide @xcite .",
    "the data is fully anonymised and considers only confirmed connections between users ( for more data details see si ) .    in what follows",
    "we first provide empirical evidence of the distribution of individual adoption thresholds and other structural and dynamical features of a worldwide adoption cluster .",
    "we incorporate the observed structural and threshold heterogeneities into a dynamical threshold model where multiple nodes adopting spontaneously ( i.e. firstly among their neighbours ) are allowed @xcite .",
    "we find that if the fraction of users who reject to adopt the product is large , the system enters a quenched state where the evolution and structure of the global adoption cluster is very similar to our empirical observations .",
    "model calculations and the analysis of the real social contagion process suggest that the evolving structure of an adoption cluster differs radically from what has been proposed earlier @xcite , since it is triggered by several spontaneous adoptions arriving at a constant rate , while stable adopters who are initially resisting exposure , are actually responsible for the emergence of global social adoption ( fig .  [ fig:1]b and c ) .",
    "social contagion phenomena can be modelled as binary - state processes evolving on networks and driven by threshold mechanisms . in these systems individuals",
    "are represented by nodes , each being either in a susceptible ( 0 ) or adopter ( 1 ) state and influencing each other by transferring information via social ties @xcite .",
    "nodes are connected in a network with degree distribution @xmath3 and average degree @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , each node has an individual threshold @xmath5 $ ] drawn from a distribution @xmath6 with average @xmath7 .",
    "this threshold determines the minimum fraction of exposed neighbours that triggers adoption and captures the resistance of an individual against engaging in spreading behaviour .",
    "once a node reaches its threshold , it switches state from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and keeps it until the end of the dynamics . in his seminal paper about threshold dynamics , watts @xcite classified nodes into three categories based on their threshold and degree .",
    "he identified _",
    "nodes that spontaneously change state to @xmath9 , thus starting the process .",
    "such nodes have a trivial threshold @xmath10",
    ". then there are nodes with threshold @xmath11 , called _",
    "vulnerable _ , which need one adopting neighbour before their own adoption . finally , there are more resilient nodes with threshold @xmath12 , denoted as _ stable _ , referring to individuals in need of strong social influence to follow the actions of their acquaintances .    in the wt model @xcite , small perturbations ( like the spontaneous adoption of a single seed node )",
    "can trigger global cascading patterns .",
    "however , their emergence is subject to the so - called _ cascade condition _ : the innovator seed has to be linked to a percolating vulnerable cluster , which adopts immediately afterwards and further triggers a global cascade ( i.e. a set of adopters larger than a fixed fraction of the finite network ) .",
    "the cascade condition is satisfied if the network is inside a bounded regime in @xmath13-space @xcite .",
    "this regime depends on degree and threshold heterogeneities @xcite and may change its shape if several innovators start the process @xcite .",
    "degree and threshold heterogeneities are indeed present in the social network of skype .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath3 is well approximated by a lognormal function @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) with parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( fig .  [ fig:1]d ) , giving an average degree @xmath19 ( for goodness of fit see si ) .",
    "moreover , at the time of adoption we can measure the threshold @xmath20 of a user by counting the number @xmath21 of its neighbours who have adopted the service earlier .",
    "we then group users by degree and calculate the distribution @xmath22 of the integer threshold @xmath21 @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]e ) . by using the scaling relation @xmath23 all distributions collapse to a master curve well approximated by a lognormal function @xmath24 , with parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 as constrained by the average threshold @xmath27 ( see mm and si ) .",
    "note that we observe qualitatively the same scaling and lognormal shape of the threshold distribution for another service ( see si ) .",
    "these empirical observations , in addition to the broad degree distribution , provide quantitative evidence about the heterogeneous nature of adoption thresholds .",
    "since we know the complete structure of the online social network , as well as the first time of service usage for all adopters , we can follow the temporal evolution of the adoption dynamics . by counting the number of adopting neighbours of an ego",
    ", we identify innovators ( @xmath28 ) , and vulnerable ( @xmath29 ) or stable ( @xmath30 ) nodes .",
    "the adoption rates for these categories behave rather differently from previous suggestions @xcite ( fig .  [",
    "fig:1]f ) .",
    "first , there is not only one seed but an increasing fraction of innovators in the system who , after an initial period , adopt approximately at a constant rate .",
    "second , vulnerable nodes adopt approximately with the same rate as innovators suggesting a strong correlation between these types of adoption .",
    "third , the overall adoption process accelerates due to the increasing rate of stable adoptions induced by social influence . at the same time a giant adoption cluster grows and percolates through the whole network ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a , main panel ) . despite of this expansion dynamics and connected structure of the service adoption cluster ,",
    "the service reaches less than @xmath31 of the total number of active skype users over a period of @xmath32 years @xcite .",
    "therefore we ask whether one can refer to these adoption clusters as cascades .",
    "they are not triggered by a small perturbation but induced by several innovators ; their evolution is not instantaneous but ranges through several years ; and although they involve millions of individuals , they reach only a reduced fraction of the whole network .",
    "to answer we incorporate the above mentioned features into a dynamical threshold model @xcite with a growing group of innovators and investigate their effect on the evolution of global social adoption .",
    "note that we also perform a null model study to demonstrate , on the system level , that social influence dominates the contagion process , but not homophily ( see section s3 of the si , together with another empirical spreading scenario in s7.1 ) .",
    "our modelling framework is an extension to conventional threshold dynamics on networks studied by watts , gleeson , singh , and others , where all nodes are initially susceptible and innovators are only introduced as an initial seed of arbitrary size  @xcite . apart from the threshold rule discussed above , our model considers two additional features : ( i ) a fraction @xmath33 of ` immune ' nodes that never adopt , indicating lack of interest in the service ; ( ii ) due to external influence , susceptible nodes adopt the innovation spontaneously ( i.e. become innovators ) throughout time with constant rate @xmath34 , rather than only at the beginning of the dynamics . in this way",
    ", the dynamical evolution of the system is completely defined by the online social network , the distribution @xmath6 and the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider a configuration - model network , i.e. , we ignore correlations in the social network and characterise it solely by its degree distribution @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , node degrees and thresholds are considered to be independent @xcite .",
    "our threshold model , which has also been introduced in @xcite , can be studied analytically by extending the framework of approximate master equations ( ames ) for monotone binary - state dynamics recently developed by gleeson  @xcite , where the transition rate between susceptible and adoption states only depends on the number @xmath35 of network neighbours that have already adopted .",
    "we describe a node by the property vector @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is its degree and @xmath38 its type , i.e. @xmath39 is the type of the fraction @xmath33 of immune nodes , while @xmath40 is the type of all non - immune nodes that have threshold @xmath41 . in this way @xmath6 is substituted by the discrete distribution of types @xmath42 ( for @xmath43 ) .",
    "the integer @xmath44 is the maximum number of degrees ( or non - zero types ) considered in the ame framework , which can be increased to improve the accuracy of the analytical approximation at the expense of speed in its numerical computation ( see s4.2 ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the ame system describing the dynamics of the threshold model is reduced to the pair of ordinary differential equations ( see si ) ,    [ eq : reducedames ] @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the fraction of adopters in the network , @xmath47 is the probability that a randomly chosen neighbour of a susceptible node is an adopter , and the initial conditions are @xmath48 . here , @xmath49,\\ ] ] and , @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the binomial distribution",

    "after @xmath99 iterations ( matching the length of the real observation period ) we identify three regimes of the dynamics ( fig .",

    "we repeat the same calculations for another service and find qualitatively the same picture , but with the crossover regime shifted towards larger @xmath33 values due to the different parametrisation of the model process .",
    "note that another possible reason for the slow adoption could be the time users wait between their threshold has been reached and actual adoption .",
    "we test for the effect of this potential scenario on the empirical curves but find no qualitative change in the dynamics ( see si ) .",
    "we can use these calculations to estimate the only unknown parameter ( the fraction @xmath33 of immune nodes in skype ) by matching the size of the largest component ( @xmath105 ) between real and model adoption networks at time @xmath106 .",

    "the other analysed service turns out to lie right of the crossover regime , which explains its large innovator adoption rate and reduced size of stable and vulnerable adoption clusters ( see si ) .    to test the validity of the prediction of @xmath33 we perform three different calculations .",
    "first we measure the maximum relative growth rate of cumulative adoption and find a good match between model and data ( skype s3 and model skype s3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) . in other words , the model correctly estimates the speed of the adoption process .",
    "second , we measure the distribution @xmath95 of depths of induced vulnerable trees ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]d ) . finally ,",
    "in order to verify earlier theoretical suggestions @xcite , we look at the correlation @xmath97 between the degree of innovators and the average size of vulnerable trees induced by them ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]e ) .",
    "we perform the last two measurements on the real data and in the model process for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , as well as for the predicted value @xmath96 . in the case of @xmath97 , we find a strong positive correlation in the data , explained partially by degree heterogeneities in the underlying social network , but surprisingly well emulated by the model .",
    "more importantly , although both quantities appear to scale with @xmath33 , measures for the estimated @xmath33 value fit the empirical data remarkably well , confirming our earlier validation based on the matching of relative component sizes ( for further discussion see si ) .",
    "although some products and innovations diffusing in society may cover a large fraction of the population , their spreading tends to follow slow cascading patterns , the dynamics of which have been modelled before by simple diffusion models like that of bass @xcite .",
    "however , this approach neglects threshold mechanisms that arguably drive the decision making of single individuals . on the other hand , threshold models study the conditions for cascades in global diffusion but do not address their temporal evolution , which is clearly a relevant factor in real - world adoption processes .",
    "these models are commonly used to predict rapid cascading patterns of adoption , which is a more realistic scenario for the spreading of information , opinions , or behavioural patterns but are not observed in the case of product or innovation diffusion where adoption requires additional efforts , e.g. , free or paid registration . here",
    "we provide a solution for this conundrum by analysing and modelling the worldwide spread of an online service in the techno - social communication network of skype . beyond the novel empirical evidence about heterogeneous adoption thresholds and non - linear dynamics of the adoption process",
    ", we identify two additional components necessary to introduce in the modelling of product adoption , namely : ( a ) a constant flow of innovators , which may induce rapid adoption cascades even if the system is initially out of the cascading regime ; and ( b ) a fraction of immune nodes that forces the system into a quenched state where adoption slows down .",
    "these features are responsible for a critical structure of empirical adoption components that radically differs from previous theoretical expectations .",
    "we incorporate these mechanisms into a threshold model controlled by the rate of innovators and the fraction of immune nodes .",
    "the model is able to reproduce several pathways ranging from cascading behaviour to more realistic dynamics of innovation adoption . by constraining the model with empirically determined parameters ,",
    "we provide an estimate for the real fraction of susceptible agents in the social network of skype , and validate this prediction through correlated structural features matching empirical observations .",
    "our aim in this study was to provide empirical observations as well as methods and tools to model the dynamics of social contagion phenomena with the hope it will foster thoughts for future research .",
    "one possible direction would be the observation of the reported structure and evolution of the global adoption cluster in other systems similar to the ones studied in @xcite .",
    "other promising directions could be the consideration of homophilic or assortative structural correlations , the evolving nature of the underpinning social structure as studied in @xcite , interpersonal influence , or the effects of leader - follower mechanisms on the social contagion process .",

    "friends_. if user @xmath140 wants to add another user @xmath141 to his / her contact list , @xmath140 sends @xmath141 a contact request , and the edge is established at the moment @xmath141 approves the request ( or not , if the contact request is rejected ) .",
    "each edge is labelled with a time stamp indicating the moment the contact request was approved . as the underpinning social structure we consider the static representation of the skype social network , aggregated for @xmath2 months between september 2003 and november 2011 .",
    "the largest connected component of this structure includes roughly 510 million users and 4.4 billion edges .",
    "as the chosen service evolving on the skype network , we follow how users purchase `` credits '' for calling phones . for each user ,",
    "the dataset includes the date when he / she first adopted the paid product `` buy credit '' ( first credit purchase , for all purposes ) .",
    "we select this service since its lifetime of @xmath0 months is considerably long ( it was introduced in 2004 ) , and it can be adopted by registered skype users only . this way the aggregated skype network provides a complete description of the mediating social structure , which allows us to calculate the correct degree and adoption threshold for all individuals . to make additional observations and to further test our model ,",
    "we perform calculations on a second paid service called `` subscription '' , which was introduced in april 2008 , lasts for over @xmath1 months , and can also be adopted by registered skype users only .",
    "results regarding this service are presented in section [ sec : addserv ] .    by considering the online social structure and the adoption times",
    "we identify users as innovator , vulnerable , or stable nodes based on the number @xmath21 of adopting neighbours at the time of exposure .",
    "thresholds are calculated as @xmath20 for users with @xmath109 contacts .",
    "the adoption network is constructed by considering confirmed social links between users who adopted the service earlier than the time of observation @xmath81 . in order to avoid the effect of instantaneous group adoptions ( evidently not driven by social influence ) ,",
    "we only consider links between nodes who are neighbours in the underlying social network and whose adoption did not happen at the same time .",
    "note that for the categorization of nodes we use only the adoption time and the state of their peers , and thus ` real ' categories may differ slightly .",
    "for example , an innovator may appear as a vulnerable or stable node , even if its decision was not driven by social influence but some of its peers adopted earlier . to consider this bias we also measure ` effective ' rates of adoption for the model process , just like for the empirical case ( fig.1 , main text ) and section s3",
    ".    the dataset does not include identity information .",
    "all usernames are anonymized and there is no way of inferring a user s identity solely from the profile .",
    "the dataset does not contain any information about interpersonal interactions , apart from the contact list .",
    "parameters in the model are the rate of innovators @xmath142 , the degree distribution @xmath3 , the threshold distribution @xmath6 , and the fraction of immune nodes @xmath33 . other than @xmath33 , all of them can be estimated from the data as follows .",
    "as discussed in the main text , the rate of spontaneous adoption saturates approximately to a constant value after an initial transition period , which allows us to determine the rate of innovators by fitting a constant function on the curve after time @xmath143 .",
    "we estimate this rate to be @xmath144 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "s[fig : nullmodelrate]a where the dashed line assigns the fitted constant function .",
    "degrees in the aggregated skype network are broadly distributed with a fat tail corresponding to strong degree heterogeneities . to characterize this distribution",
    "analytically we select two candidate distribution functions .",
    "the first is a shifted power - law distribution function of the form , @xmath145 where @xmath109 denotes the degree , @xmath146 is the power - law exponent scaling the tail of the distribution , and @xmath147 is the minimum degree ( in our case 1 ) .",
    "@xmath148 is a constant scaling the shift of the distribution , which can be determined as @xmath149 since we know the average degree @xmath19 of the empirical network .",
    "this way our only free parameter during the fit is the degree exponent @xmath146 . after fitting this function by using the non - linear least - square method",
    ", we obtain a relatively good match with the empirical distribution ( fig .",
    "s[fig : degdistr]a ) for exponent @xmath150 .",
    "our second candidate function is a lognormal distribution function of the form , @xmath151 where @xmath72 and @xmath152 are the scaling parameters . after fitting this function by using the non - linear least square method with two free parameters ( @xmath72 and @xmath152 )",
    ", we obtain an excellent fit with the empirical distribution for parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    to select the best candidate function , we calculate the corresponding jensen - shannon ( @xmath153 ) divergence values @xcite between the empirical and fitted distributions . as a result",
    "we find that for the shifted power - law function the best fit provides @xmath154 , while for the lognormal distribution we get @xmath155 .",
    "thus we select the lognormal distribution as the best analytical function describing the degree distribution of the empirical network .",
    "the adoption threshold @xmath156 of a node is defined as @xmath157 , i.e. the fraction of adopting neighbours that trigger the adoption of the central node",
    ". therefore it can only take certain fractional values determined by the degree @xmath109 .",
    "although thresholds are defined as a fraction , by considering nodes of the same degree we can focus on the integer threshold @xmath21 , defined as the number of a node s neighbours who have adopted the service earlier .    in our method",
    "we first group nodes of the same degree , record their integer thresholds , and then calculate the threshold distribution for each degree group , as shown in the main text ( fig .  1e , inset ) .",
    "these distributions collapse to a master curve after normalization by using the scaling relation @xmath112 ( fig .  1e , main panel ) .",
    "moreover , this master curve can be well approximated by a lognormal distribution of the form , @xmath158 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as determined by the empirical average threshold @xmath27 and standard deviation ( std ) @xmath114 .",
    "these findings indicate that although individual thresholds are strongly determined by degree , their distribution is degree - invariant , suggesting that the fraction of adopting friends rather than its absolute number is relevant during the service adoption process .",
    "the estimated empirical values of parameters are summarized in table [ table : pars ] .        ) and 2nd largest ( @xmath93 ) components of the model network ( ` net ' ) , model adoption network ( ` casc ' ) , model stable network ( ` stab ' ) , and induced vulnerable trees ( ` vuln ' ) as a function of @xmath33 . dashed lines show the observed relative size of the real @xmath92 of the adopter network in 2011 ( fig .",

    "we check the dependence on @xmath33 of the average size of the largest connected component of the network ( @xmath92 ) of susceptible nodes available for the adoption process , the adoption network , the stable adoption network , and of vulnerable trees ( fig .",

    "finally we show the time when the adoption process has reached the @xmath68 of available susceptible nodes in the adoption network ( fig .",
    "s[fig : srv4model ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the @xmath33 dependence of the adoption process appears to be qualitatively similar to our earlier calculations on the `` buy credit '' service , but there are remarkable differences .",
    "firstly , the crossover regime ( depicted by the light grey area in fig .",
    "s[fig : srv4model ] ) is shifted towards larger @xmath33 values due to the different threshold distribution and innovator adoption rate . secondly , after matching the relative size of the largest connected component of the empirical adoption network ( last point on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "s[fig : srv4adclust ] , main panel ) , the predicted @xmath160 is out of the crossover regime .",
    "at this point the background social network is still not fragmented ( as evidenced by the black line in fig .",
    "s[fig : srv4model ] , which has not reached its maximum yet ) and it allows for the emergence of large connected adoption clusters .",
    "it is very sparse , however , which explains : ( a ) the dominating innovator adoption rate observed empirically ; ( b ) the reduced size of the giant component of the adoption and stable adoption networks ; and ( c ) the relatively large innovator trees as compared to the stable adoption network components .",
    "we observe that the largest vulnerable trees are smaller than the largest stable clusters in the empirical data , while the opposite is true for the model .",
    "a possible explanation of this difference is the assumption in the model that the network is degree - uncorrelated .",
    "this is a necessary approximation in order to treat the model analytically , but it might not hold for the empirical network . all in all , this picture suggests that the `` subscription '' service is out of the rapid and even the crossover cascading regimes , and that its dynamics is mostly driven by independent innovators rather than social influence , on a network of which a large majority is not susceptible to innovation ."
