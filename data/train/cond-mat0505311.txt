    "spin - triplet superconductivity , which is arousing much interests in recent years , is fascinating in a number of ways .",
    "theoretically , a most intriguing question is the following : if we consider the electron mechanism of superconductivity in the most frequently adopted hubbard model with an on - site electron - electron repulsion , we can show that triplet superconductivity is very difficult to realize for the simple reason that the pairing interaction mediated by spin fluctuations is only 1/3 in the triplet channel than in the singlet channel@xcite .",
    "so any theory attempting to explain triplet pairing has to overcome this question .",
    "experimentally , the discovery of superconductivity by maeno and coworkers in the layered perovskite ruthenium oxide sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 have kicked off renewed interests . suggestions for a triplet pairing in this material came from nmr knight shift@xcite and polarized neutron scattering@xcite . a broken time reversal symmetry is further observed with @xmath10sr@xcite and small - angle neutron scattering@xcite . as for the pairing symmetry , nmr and nqr relaxation rates have shown an absence of the hebel - slichter peak@xcite , which suggests line node(s ) in the gap function , which was supported by a specific heat measurement@xcite . while the angular dependence of thermal conductivity indicates the presence of horizontal line - nodes@xcite , a recent field - orientation dependence of the specific heat shows that the gap in the active @xmath7 band has minima along [ 100 ] directions with the passive @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands having gap minima along [ 110 ] directions@xcite .",
    "a theoretical work by zhitomirsky and rice@xcite has proposed horizontal line nodes with a good fit to the specific heat measurement@xcite . as for the mechanism that stabilizes triplet pairing , kuwabara and ogata@xcite , and independently sato and kohmoto@xcite , have suggested that triplet @xmath13-wave pairing can be induced by an anisotropy in the spin fluctuation .",
    "kuwabara and ogata@xcite have identified the most suitable gap function to be @xmath14 that breaks the time - reversal symmetry , which was also proposed by miyake and narikiyo@xcite .",
    "the chiral @xmath15 ( @xmath16 : @xmath13-wave like ) has also been obtained with a third - order perturbation theory by nomura and yamada@xcite and more recently by yanase and ogata@xcite , and with the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) for quasi - one - dimensional @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands by kuroki _",
    "et al._@xcite .    however , the validity of perturbation results truncated at finite orders has to be checked by non - perturbative methods . indeed , a recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) result by kuroki _ et al . _ have shown that the singlet @xmath17-pairing dominates over the triplet for the @xmath7 band.@xcite this situation has led arita _",
    "_ to show , with the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) , that @xmath18 pairing actually dominates over @xmath13-wave pairings as far as the on - site hubbard model is concerned , while if we go over to the extended hubbard model with off - site repulsion the triplet superconductivity can be favored but not dominant in extended hubbard model employing nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion for @xmath7 band in sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9.@xcite    generally , there is a flex result by arita et al@xcite who show that triplet superconductivity is much weaker than singlet pairs for the one - band , on - site hubbard model , which agrees with a phenomenology@xcite , while if charge fluctuations are enhanced by off - site repulsions triplet pairs have a chance to dominate .",
    "we have already shown triplet superconductivity can be dominant near the charge density wave ( cdw ) phase on square lattice with the flex in the extended hubbard model.@xcite    so the purpose of this paper is to examine how triplet superconductivity can become dominant in the extended hubbard model with the flex in general , and for @xmath7 band of sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 in particular . the extended hubbard model has been studied , primarily for specific charge densities @xmath19 , e.g. , half - filling or quarter filling , by means of the quantum monte carlo method@xcite , the weak coupling theory@xcite , the mean - field approximation@xcite , the second - order perturbation@xcite , the random phase approximation@xcite , the flex approximation@xcite , the slave - boson technique@xcite , the bosonization and the renormalization group@xcite . here",
    "we adopt the flex developed by bickers _",
    "et al._@xcite , which is a renormalized perturbation method to study pairing instabilities when exchange of spin and charge fluctuations are considered as dominant diagrams .",
    "this approximation is useful to explore the tendencies of dominant pairing relatively when the parameters are systematically varied .",
    "however , including the off - site coulomb repulsion @xmath1 susceptibilities and effective interactions become @xmath20 matrices for the lattice coordination number @xmath21 ( @xmath22 for the square lattice ) , which demand extremely computer resources .",
    "we show as far as the present finite - temperature result is concerned that ( i ) triplet @xmath4 pairing appears in between singlet @xmath23 and the cdw phase for @xmath24 , and ( ii ) the pairing symmetry changes as @xmath18 @xmath25 @xmath4 @xmath25 @xmath23 when the shape of the fermi surface is varied by the second - neighbor hopping @xmath2 .",
    "physically , all the results can be well explained by the structure and peak value of spin and charge susceptibilities .",
    "let us start with the extended hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath26 in the standard notation on a tetragonal lattice depicted in fig.[lattice ] , where nn ( nnn ) denotes nearest neighbor ( next - nearest neighbor ) sites .",
    "for the square lattice the unit of energy is taken to be the nearest - neighbor @xmath27 , and lattice constant @xmath28 .    to determine the dominant gap function",
    ", we solve liashberg s equation with the flex approximation , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the gap function , @xmath31 green s function , and @xmath32 the pairing interaction with @xmath33 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath34 , a measure of the pairing , becomes unity at @xmath35 . for the calculation",
    "we take an @xmath36 lattice , the temperature @xmath37 , and the matsubara frequency for fermions @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "esirgen _ et al._@xcite have extended the flex method to general lattice hamiltonians including the extended hubbard model . following them we introduce the pairing interaction , @xmath40(k - k';\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}};\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}')e^{i({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}+{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k'$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}')}\\nonumber\\\\ -&\\frac{1}{2}&\\left[v_{\\rm ch}\\chi_{\\rm ch}v_{\\rm ch}\\right](k - k';\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}};\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}')e^{i({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}+{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k'$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$ } } ' ) } \\nonumber\\\\ + & \\frac{1}{2}&v_{\\rm s}(0;\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}};\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}')e^{i({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}'-{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k'$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$ } } ) } \\left.\\right\\ } , \\label{s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for singlet pairing , and @xmath41(k - k';\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}};\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}')e^{i({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}+{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k'$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}')}\\nonumber\\\\ -&\\frac{1}{2}&\\left[v_{\\rm ch}\\chi_{\\rm ch}v_{\\rm ch}\\right](k - k';\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}};\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}')e^{i({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}+{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k'$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}')}\\nonumber\\\\ + & \\frac{1}{2}&v_{\\rm t}(0;\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}};\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}')e^{i({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}'-{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k'$}}\\cdot\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$ } } ) }   \\left.\\right\\ } \\label{t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for triplet pairing .",

    "we have found that the @xmath51 dependence of @xmath52 and @xmath53 does not significantly affect @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "accordingly the peak position of @xmath56 is almost the same as that for @xmath57 term in the expression for @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath58 , @xmath59 , appearing in the last lines in eqs.([s],[t ] ) respectively , are constant terms involving @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath60    when the off - site interaction @xmath1 is introduced all the vertices ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) as well as the susceptibilities become @xmath20 matrices for the lattice coordination number @xmath63 for the square lattice ) .",
    "we consider @xmath7 band of sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 whose band filling is @xmath64 . to represent the shape of the fermi surface obtained by arpes@xcite",
    ", we choose parameters @xmath65 and next nearest hopping @xmath66 .",
    "we first show the phase diagram against on - site coulomb interaction @xmath0 and the nearest neighbor coulomb interaction @xmath1 ( fig . [ phase ] ) .",
    "there , we have assumed that the dominant superconductivity pairing is the one that has the largest eigenvalue @xmath34 in liashberg s equation calculated at @xmath37 . while the value of @xmath34 for @xmath37 is still much smaller than unity , it is difficult to extend the flex calculation to lower temperatures , given the complexity of the ( extended hubbard ) model .",
    "so this amounts to an assumption that the order in which @xmath34 s appear for various pairing symmetries does not change for @xmath67 .",
    "the charge density wave ( cdw ) is identified as the region in which the charge susceptibility ( which has a peak at @xmath68 ) diverges at @xmath37 .    in the result a triplet superconductivity phase ( which does not exist for a single band when @xmath1 is absent ) is seen to appear just below the cdw phase for @xmath24 .",
    "the maximum eigenvalue of charge and spin susceptibilities and detailed behavior of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath1 for fixed @xmath69 is shown in fig .",
    "[ su - csdw ] . from the figure",
    "we see that the triplet superconductivity becomes dominant when the charge susceptibility @xmath56 is larger than the spin susceptibility @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ gap ] shows gap functions in @xmath71-space , which shows that the triplet ( which has the highest @xmath34 ) has a gap function @xmath72 ) , while the two singlet gap functions have @xmath23 and @xmath73.@xcite    we can trace back the reason why these gap functions are favored to the structure of spin and charge susceptibilities .",
    "figure [ peak ] shows the peak positions of spin and charge susceptibilities for @xmath74 .",
    "the peak positions for charge are around @xmath75 , while those for spin are ferromagnetic - like around @xmath76 , @xmath77 . in liashberg s eq.([elia])-([t ] ) , we see that for singlet the coefficient of @xmath70 ( @xmath56 ) term in @xmath78 are positive ( negative ) .",
    "so the dominant gap function must change sign across the momentum transfer that points the peak position in the spin susceptibility , while the gap function must not change sign across the momentum transfer that points the peak position in the charge susceptibility . for triplet ,",
    "on the other hand , the coefficients of @xmath70 and @xmath56 terms in @xmath55 are both negative .",
    "so the gap function should have the same sign across both the spin and charge peak positions .",
    "when @xmath1 is small , the spin susceptibility is much greater than the charge susceptibility , and the spin - fluctuation mediated pairing interaction for singlet is three times larger than that for triplet .",
    "this explains @xmath23 , which changes sign across @xmath76 , @xmath77 , becomes the dominant gap function . for large @xmath1 ,",
    "the charge susceptibility becomes dominant , and the pairing interaction becomes the same between singlet and triplet channels , i.e. , @xmath79 and @xmath80 become similar in magnitude . whether triplet is more favored than singlet depends on the other factors such as the number of nodes on the fermi surface , which work unfavorably for pairing since the integration around the node in the right hand side of eqn.([elia ] ) can not contribute to @xmath34 .",
    "so a larger the number of nodes is basically unfavored .    as another factor",
    ", we can find from fig .",
    "[ su - csdw ] that the @xmath34 s for the gap function @xmath4 and @xmath73 increase more sharply than that for @xmath23 for @xmath81 , where @xmath56 increases sharply .",
    "the reason should be that the first two have the same sign across the peak of @xmath56 around @xmath82 or @xmath83 , while the latter has slightly warped nodal lines .",
    "so there is a region exists where the gap function has the opposite signs across the peak of @xmath56 .",
    "returning to sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 , our result in fig .",
    "[ su - csdw ] indicates that if triplet can be dominant , the gap function should be @xmath4 which is degenerate with @xmath5 .",
    "the true gap function below @xmath84 should be a complex linear combination , @xmath85 which is more stable thermodynamically and breaks the time - reversal symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ tri ] ) .",
    "the absolute value of the gap function has minima on the fermi surface along @xmath86 $ ] and equivalent directions as depicted in fig .",
    "[ tri ] with open circles , which is consistent with the recent experiment of the specific heat in rotated magnetic fields.@xcite however , we also notice that the triplet region is very narrow , so identification of the pairing in sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 would require a precise determination of the parameters in that material . in addition , if we include the effect of @xmath11 and @xmath12 band of sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 this triplet region may expand .",
    "let us identify the relation between the pairing symmetry and shape of the fermi surface in the present context .",
    "for that purpose we can change the second neighbor hopping @xmath2 , which controls the warping ( and even the topology ) of the fermi surface . in fig .",
    "[ su - t ] we show @xmath34 and the dominant pairing symmetry when @xmath2 is varied with fixed @xmath87 and @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ fermi - gap - t ] depicts how the fermi surface obtained by @xmath88 changes with @xmath2 .",
    "the reason why those gap functions dominate can be understood in terms of the structure and value of the spin and charge susceptibilities . while the peaks in the spin susceptibility for @xmath89 correspond to the nesting vectors for the fermi surface",
    ", the peaks for large @xmath1 do not necessarily correspond to those .",
    "the result shows that the peaks change from @xmath90 , @xmath91 for @xmath92 , @xmath93 for @xmath94 , to @xmath95 , @xmath96 for @xmath97 as seen in fig .",
    "[ sdw - peak ] . on the other hand",
    "the peak position in the charge susceptibility remains at @xmath68 for the whole range of @xmath2 .",
    "the peak values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are shown in fig .",
    "[ csdw - t ] , where the peak of @xmath100 changes rapidly while @xmath101 has an almost constant peak value .    from the result",
    "we see that nearly antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations favor @xmath18 pairing for @xmath92 as in the high-@xmath84 cuprates , strong charge fluctuations favor @xmath4 for @xmath102 . for @xmath103 where the spin susceptibility again exceeds the charge susceptibility , nearly ferromagnetic spin fluctuations favor @xmath23 which has many sign changes on the fermi surface .",
    "finally it is interesting to identify the reason why the charge fluctuation is sharply peaked around @xmath104 . to elaborate the point , we first note the van - hove singularities , which reside at @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 for the @xmath109 tight - binding model .",
    "so the charge susceptibility with a peak around @xmath68 should be maximized when the fermi surface approaches @xmath105 and @xmath106 , since the pair hopping with the momentum transfer @xmath68 connects the van - hove singularities , where the density of state is large . in the terminology of the previous work of ours@xcite ,",
    "the fermi surface becomes `` thick '' around the van - hove singularities .",
    "we have actually studied the relation between the charge susceptibility and the fermi surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ van ] to confirm that the charge susceptibility becomes maximum for @xmath110 , at which the fermi surface just touches the van - hove singularities @xmath105 , @xmath106 and the topology of the fermi surface changes .",
    "we see in the figure that the fermi surface becomes `` thick '' around the van - hove singularities .",
    "the value @xmath104 is close to the @xmath2 for @xmath7 band of sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 , which may imply that triplet superconductivity induced by charge fluctuations may in fact be relevant there .",
    "so far we have shown all the results in @xmath111-space , but it is also heuristic to represent the pairing symmetry in real space as depicted in fig .",
    "[ real ] . from fig .",
    "[ su - t]-[csdw - t ] we see that @xmath18 is suppressed as the @xmath68 charge fluctuation increases , while from fig .",
    "[ su - csdw ] @xmath4 , @xmath112 and @xmath23 are favored as the charge fluctuation increases .",
    "this should be because strong @xmath68 charge fluctuations tend to arrange electrons diagonally on the lattice , and suppresses @xmath18 pairs across the nearest neighbors , but do not disturb the pairing such as @xmath4 , @xmath112 and @xmath23 formed across more distant sites .",
    "we have studied the pairing symmetry in the one - band extended hubbard model having the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion for square lattice . for the parameter which represents @xmath7 band of sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 , spin - triplet superconductivity",
    "whose symmetry is @xmath4 appears just below the cdw phase .",
    "so the true gap below @xmath84 is suggested to be a chiral @xmath6 which breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it would be interesting to experimentally detect the pairing state using , for example , a theoretical prediction made in ref . .",
    "however , the region for the spin - triplet superconductivity is very small , and the identification of the pairing in sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 will require a precise determination of parameters , and also a study of the effects of @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands .",
    "we have also examined the relation between the pairing symmetry and the shape of the fermi surface by varying @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , the shape of the fermi surface changes drastically which changes the structure of @xmath70 and @xmath56 .",
    "this in turn changes the pairing symmetry as @xmath113 .",
    "in addition , @xmath56 becomes especially large when the fermi surface touches van - hove singularities at which the fermi surface changes the topology , which is achieved for @xmath110 near the parameter for @xmath7 band of sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 .",
