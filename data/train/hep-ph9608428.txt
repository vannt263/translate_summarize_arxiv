    "<S> numerical results for the ( rest - frame ) @xmath0 potential in light - front quantized @xmath1 on a @xmath2 lattice are presented . both in the longitudinal as well as the @xmath2 spatial directions one obtains linear confinement . </S>",
    "<S> the confinement mechanism in light - front qcd depends on the orientation of the external charges : for longitudinally ( with respect to the boost direction in the infinite momentum frame ) separated quarks , confinement arises from the instantaneous interaction piece in the hamiltonian while for @xmath2 separated quarks , the confinement mechanism is similar to the one in hamiltonian lattice qcd . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , already a very simple ansatz for the effective link - field potential yields an almost rotationally symmetric @xmath0 potential . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum carried by the glue strongly depends on the orientation ( `` polarization '' ) of the @xmath0 pair .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 )    light - front ( lf ) quantization is the most physical approach to calculating parton distributions on the basis of qcd  @xcite . in the transverse lattice formulation of qcd  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one keeps the time direction and one spatial direction continuous and discretizes the transverse spatial directions . </S>",
    "<S> the space time geometry is thus an array of @xmath3 dimensional sheets ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : perpl ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one the one hand , this provide both uv and iv cutoffs in the transverse directions and on the other hand one can still perform lf quantization since the longitudinal directions are continuous . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the compact formulation , it is straightforward to implement gauss law as a constraint on the states  avoiding troublesome divergences for @xmath4 , which plague many other formulations of lf qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> another advantage of the transverse lattice is that confinement is manifest in the limit of large @xmath2 lattice spacing @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism differs for the longitudinal and the @xmath2 directions : if one separates a @xmath0 pair longitudinally then , since @xmath5 is large , the fields in different sheets couple only weakly and the quarks interact only with fields in the same sheet , i.e. effectively the theory reduces to @xmath3 dimensional qcd , where confinement is known to be linear . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when one separates the @xmath0 pair transversely , gauge invariance demands that they are connected by a chain of ( gluon ) link fields . for large @xmath5 , where there are only little fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , this implies that the energy of such a configuration is given by the energy for creating one link quantum times the number of link quanta , i.e. linear confinement also in the @xmath2 direction . </S>",
    "<S> since the confinement mechanisms are very different for these two cases , one might ask whether a rotationally invariant @xmath0 potential results in the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the limit of large @xmath5 one finds in @xmath6 dimensions @xcite :    @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the string tension , which is clearly not rotationally invariant . in order to investigate this issue , i used dlcq and a lanzcos algorithm to calculate the rest frame @xmath0 potential from the lf hamiltonian for @xmath1 on a @xmath2 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure for computing the rest frame potential in this formalism follows ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the light - front hamiltonian for compact qcd on a transverse lattice has been introduced by bardeen @xcite . for pure glue qcd in 2 + 1 dimensions </S>",
    "<S> one finds @xmath9 : + v_{eff}(u ) , \\label{eq : pminus}\\ ] ] where @xmath10    .45 cm    ( 15,9.3)(-7,5.5 ) ( 1.5,8.5)(0,1)1.7 ( 1.,11.1)(0,0)(discrete ) ( 1.,12.0)(0,0)@xmath2 space ( 1.5,12.6)(0,1)1.6 ( 2.,8.)(3,-1)1.2 ( 4.5,6.9)(0,0)long . space ( 4.5,6.2)(0,0)(continuous ) ( 7.1,6.3)(3,-1)1.8 ( 10.4,5.8)(3,1)1.8 ( 14.5,6.2)(0,0)(continuous ) ( 14.5,6.9)(0,0)time ( 15.8,7.6)(3,1)1.8    and @xmath11 are the link fields , which are quantized matrix fields and satisfy the usual commutation relations . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , one would like to work with @xmath12 , but in practice this is very complicated @xcite and it is advantageous to work with an unconstrained complex matrix field and instead add an effective constraint term @xmath13 to the light - front hamiltonian . in the case of @xmath14 , in the classical limit , @xmath13 can be taken of the form @xmath15 : + c_4 \\sum_n\\mbox{tr}:\\left [ u^\\dagger_nu_nu^\\dagger_nu_n\\right ] : , \\label{eq : constr}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which provides an effective potential which is minimized for @xmath18 . in the @xmath19 limit , </S>",
    "<S> the difference between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is irrelevant and eq.([eq : constr ] ) is thus suitable for enforcing the @xmath21 constraint in the classical limit . one might be tempted to try a similar ansatz for the lf quantized case </S>",
    "<S> there are several reasons why a different form for the effective potential might be desirable . </S>",
    "<S> first , if one would still attempt to work with an effective potential of the above form then physical states would necessarily look extremely complicated , which has to do with the fact that the above ansatz for the effective potential corresponds to working close to the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> thus even if the ansatz in eq.([eq : constr ] ) would work in principle , it would most likely not be very practical . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since a `` mexican hat '' potential corresponds to a situation where one is working with the _ false _ vacuum , it is questionable whether a physical situation where a particle runs at the bottom of a mexican hat can be described at all by a lf hamiltonian using degrees of freedom expanded around the origin .    </S>",
    "<S> for these two reasons , it makes more sense not to consider @xmath11 as the _ bare _ link field , but instead think of it as some kind of _ blocked _ or _ smeared _ variable . </S>",
    "<S> the blocking has several consequences . </S>",
    "<S> first , the @xmath21 constraint gets relaxed which reflects itself in the fact that the effective potential is no longer just a narrow valley @xcite . secondly , </S>",
    "<S> using smeared variables , it might be easier to cover large physical distances with only few degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the price one has to pay for these advantages is that the effective potential gets more complex and in general more terms are necessary than shown in eq.([eq : constr ] ) . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite an attempt has been made to fit the effective potential to the glueball spectrum by making an ansatz which includes all operators up to dimension four . </S>",
    "<S> since this work is a first study of the rest - frame @xmath0 potential and , as we will discuss below , the @xmath0 potential turns out to be rather insensitive to terms of dimension greater than two in @xmath13 , we will instead only consider a much simpler ansatz in the following and keep only the quadratic term @xmath22 an approximation , where one allows at most one link field quantum per link , was used . within this approximation , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains only a first order phase transition at the critical point , i.e. the lattice spacing always remains finite in physical units . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were done at the critical point , where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 )  with ( without ) fock space truncation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath0 potential is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] as a function of @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.cm    ( 1.5,1)(1.35,7.3 )    ( 3.,6.)(0,0)(a )    ( 15,6)(-7,1.3 )    ( 3.,6.)(0,0)(b )    one free dimensionless parameter was adjusted in the calculation to get equal string tensions in the longitudinal and transverse directions ( note that this parameter does not affect the numerical calculation but is only relevant for scale setting ) . for large @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath26 fills the area between the dotted lines . </S>",
    "<S> the symbols are numerical results at the critical point for various directions . </S>",
    "<S> the small residual anisotropy is probably due to the use of an oversimplified effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> note that while qed and qcd are equivalent as long as one restricts oneself to only one quantum per link ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) , this is no longer the case for the calculations without such a restriction ( fig . [ fig1]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , one would expect a much stronger violation of rotational symmetry than in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the reason this did not happen is probably the following : typically , ground states of lf hamiltonians are dominated by the lowest fock component . for the string connecting a @xmath0 pair , this implies that the wavefunction is dominated by components with only one quantum per link  where higher order terms in the effective potential do not matter . </S>",
    "<S> we are currently investigating excited states of the @xmath0 string , which correspond to hybrid stated of quarkonium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in these excited states , higher order terms in the effective potential do matter and we expect to obtain information about the connection between the form of the effective potential and rotational symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.cm    ( 15,8.5)(-1,1.5 )    another physical observable for the @xmath0 states is the momentum carried by the glue ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xglue ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one finds a strong anisotropy in the sense that the gluons ( link fields ) carry much more momentum when the @xmath0 pair is separated transversely than when it is separated longitudinally ( at the same physical distance , i.e. even though the same amount of energy is stored in the gluon field in both cases ) . such a result is physical and is familiar from qed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be most easily understood from the point - of - view of an infinite momentum boost : if the electric field lines before the boost are @xmath2 to the boost directions , the field after the boost will look almost like a transverse electromagnetic wave and carries a large ( pointing ) momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case when the electric field is parallel to the boost direction . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy effect is more pronounced in qcd than in qed because the ( rest frame ) electric field is squeezed into flux tubes . </S>",
    "<S> this effect might have measurable consequences in the decays of polarized hybrid states and shows that the difference between confinement mechanisms in lf - qcd for longitudinal and @xmath2 directions has physical consequences . </S>"
