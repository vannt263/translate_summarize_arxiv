    "in the context of the growth of renewable power sources in electricity generation , a novel power packet dispatching system has been proposed for the purpose of managing low power renewable power sources together with commercial power sources and supplying power based on demands  @xcite .",
    "the basic configuration of the power packet dispatching system , which consists of dc power sources , a mixer , power line , a router , and loads , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppds ] .",
    "the mixer produces power packets by switching selected power sources on and off based on its clock frequency .",
    "the proposed configuration of one power packet is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerpacket ] , which includes information tags and payload @xcite .",
    "in particular , useful information , such as the power source and power destination ( load address ) , are the main part of the header .",
    "the footer is the end signal of one power packet and the payload carries electric power .",
    "power packets are transmitted from a mixer to a router through a power line in the time - division multiplexing ( tdm ) fashion .",
    "the router is in charge of determining the route for each power packet according to the information attached in the header and transferring power to the requested load @xcite . for the sake of recognition of the packet signal in the router",
    "so as to determine the route for power packets precisely , the clock synchronization between the mixer and router is required .",
    "different clock synchronization methods have been employed in the power packet dispatching system . in @xcite",
    "the clock synchronization has been achieved by a clock recovery circuit and in @xcite an external clock line is adopted for external synchronization . however , the line connection for synchronization limits the extension of system distribution , because of the delay and noise generated by clock lines .",
    "the failure in synchronization caused by the deficiency of external clock line is explained theoretically in @xcite . in @xcite , a first order control of digital clock synchronization",
    "is applied and the clock synchronization is achieved automatically between the mixer and router with the aid of the preamble of power packet .",
    "the preamble contains several cycles of the mixer clock signal .",
    "the performance of clock synchronization is improved by a second order control scheme in @xcite .             + the security of power packet dispatching is defined as protecting the content of power packet , which consists of both information tags and power , from unknown consumer ( attacker ) . for the system in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppds ] , when an attacker who exists between the mixer and the router receives power packets , he may deduce the packet signal and then obtain private information of consumers . with respect to power , the attacker can steal the power if he connects some devices directly to the power line .",
    "in other words , there is no security in the basic power packet dispatching system according to the definition of security .",
    "we can easily imagine that the attacker may even change the information purposely and then send the tampered packet to the router .",
    "in doing so , he may give rise to wrong power dispatching , which will possibly cause a damage to the running system .",
    "considering the consumers privacy and safety of the system , the security of power packet between the mixer and router should be established . for this purpose",
    ", we propose to encrypt power packets before sending them .",
    "+ spread spectrum communications have been widely used in secure communication field .",
    "the uniform spreading of spectrum is one of the desired features in encryption .",
    "this is because the spectrum may be one of the clues for decryption . besides that",
    ", a message may be hidden in the background noise by spreading its bandwidth with coding and by transmitting signal at a low averaged power , which is called a low - probability - of - intercept  @xcite .",
    "chaotic sequences are very appealing for the use as carriers in direct - sequence spread spectrum ( dsss ) system due to their broad band spectrum .",
    "they can spread spectrum more uniformly compared with the conventional sequences such as the gold sequence and walsh - hadamard sequence as described in @xcite .",
    "power spread is also considered in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of synchronization between chaotic systems was reported by pecora and carroll @xcite .",
    "after that , many chaos - based communication systems had been proposed and analyzed @xcite . in the power packet dispatching system , power packet is generated in digital form . hence , digital encryption scheme is required .",
    "chaos shift keying ( csk ) scheme with coherent detection was firstly proposed in @xcite to encode digital symbols with chaotic signals .",
    "however , the sensitive dependence of chaotic signals upon initial condition makes it very difficult to replica signal in the receiver @xcite .",
    "therefore , in chaos - based communication systems , non - coherent detection of received signal has advantage over coherent detection . the differential chaos shift keying ( dcsk )",
    "scheme is a typical non - coherent chaos - based communication scheme @xcite , which also solves the problem of threshold shift in non - coherent csk system @xcite . in view of features of the dcsk scheme , we investigate the power packet encryption using dcsk scheme to estabish the security of power packet dispatching in this paper .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the operating principles of dcsk scheme are summarized according to references @xcite for its application to power packet encryption .",
    "section 3 presents two power packet encryption methods using dcsk scheme , which are partial power packet encryption and whole power packet encryption . at the same time",
    ", the security status of power packet is also discussed .",
    "power transfer through the modulator is analyzed and then examined through simulations in section 4 .",
    "the final section is devoted for the conclusions .",
    "the operating principles of the differential chaos shift keying ( dcsk ) scheme was reported in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dcskmod ] presents the block diagram of a dcsk modulator . in the scheme ,",
    "every information bit period is divided into two equal time slots , so that every bit @xmath0 can be represented by two consecutive chaotic sequences : reference sequence and data sequence . here",

    "the data sequence is determined by @xmath0 and the reference sequence .",
    "when the information bit to be sent is ` 1 ' , the data sequence is identical to the reference sequence . whereas , if the information bit is ` 1 ' , the data sequence is inverted to the reference sequence . in this way",
    ", the data sequence carries information bits .",

    "@xmath41 is also related only to the chaotic signal @xmath2 but it is negative . since awgn channel is assumed between the modulator and demodulator , it can be deduced that both @xmath36 ( or @xmath42 ) and @xmath37 have a zero mean .",
    "therefore , the threshold value of the detector can be set at zero optimally . as a consequence",
    ", the information bit can be recovered through the detector as @xmath43",
    "given the principles of dcsk scheme in section  [ sec : dcsk ] , we apply the scheme to encrypt power packet aiming to establish the security of power packet dispatching .",
    "when the scheme is applied to power packet encryption , the packet signals are encrypted as information bits in a conventional dcsk modulator . in this section ,",
    "two encryption methods for power packet will be discussed , i.e. , partial power packet encryption and whole power packet encryption . from the principle of dcsk demodulator , the spreading factor ( @xmath8 ) should be obtained by the demodulator in advance so that the information bits can be recovered correctly .",
    "we refer to @xmath8 as key in our encryption methods .      in the power packet dispatching system , the synchronization is essential to handshake between the sender and receiver of power packet , that is , the mixer and router . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerpacket ] , the preamble is designed for achieving the clock synchronization between the mixer and router @xcite . at the meantime ,",
    "from the viewpoint of privacy protect , the header should be hidden during transmission , because the header may include consumers private information .",
    "therefore the security of information is possibly established , provided that the preamble and header are protected . in partial power packet encryption , only preamble and header are encrypted using dcsk scheme .",
    "the rest of the packet ( payload and footer ) remains unencrypted .",

    "[ fig : moddemodsys ] .",
    "the mixer is integrated with a dcsk modulator and the router is integrated with a dcsk demodulator . as shown in this figure , the power packet generated by the mixer is partially encrypted through the dcsk modulator .",

    ", the encrypted packet can be recovered if the key is obtained beforehand as mentioned in section  [ sec : dcsk ] .",
    "the whole packet can be recovered , not only because the recovered preamble and header suffice to determine the route of power packet in the router , but also based on the fact that the unencryption of the payload and footer guarantees the power in power packet . + under partial encryption , assume that an attacker exists in the system during power packet transmission . the security status of information and power can be analyzed . here",
    ", we focus on the information contained in the preamble and header without considering the footer , since the footer is the end signal of a power packet . when the packet is caught by the attacker , he can not obtain information because of the disability of recovering the packet signals without the key .",
    "therefore , the security of information is achieved .",
    "nevertheless , the power can be stolen by the attacker if he connect some device directly to the power line .",
    "it means the security of power can not be achieved in this method .",
    "in addition , the power of power packet is carried by the payload as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "therefore , whole power of packet may be stolen by the attacker since the payload is transmitted without encryption .      in order to further improve the security of power packet dispatching",
    ", we propose to encrypt the whole power packet .",
    "figure  [ fig : wholemoddemodsys ] shows the whole power packet encryption method .",
    "it is clear that there is no difference in the security of information between these two methods , since the preamble and header are encrypted in both methods .",
    "next , we will discuss about the power .",
    "the power can still be stolen by the attacker if he connects some devices directly to the power line .",
    "however , we should bear in mind that payload carries the power of packet .",
    "thus what calls for special attention is that once the payload is encrypted , the power of encrypted packet may be changed .",
    "+ the whole encryption method encrypts both information tags and payload .",
    "it is different from the original dcsk scheme , where the tranferred signal is digital data without physical quantity . in order to transfer power ,",
    "the dcsk modulator is modified as in fig .",
    "[ fig : wholemoddcsk ] . in the chaos generator , we suppose the generated chaotic signal carries power for encryption . the data sequence becomes the product of chaotic signal and the packet signal .",
