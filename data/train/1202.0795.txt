    "<S> an arch will grow on a rapidly deployed thin string in contact with a rigid plane . </S>",
    "<S> we present a qualitative model for the growing structure involving the amplification , rectification , and advection of slack in the presence of a steady stress field , validate our assumptions with numerical experiments , and pose new questions about the spatially developing motions of thin objects .    </S>",
    "<S> the deployment of a quasi - one - dimensional object from a roll or pile is a canonical event , important for textile manufacture @xcite , tethered satellite control @xcite , intercontinental telecommunications @xcite , aerial refueling , boating , and gardening . despite this ubiquity </S>",
    "<S> , we were recently surprised by an observation of these dynamics , as embodied by a rapidly straightened chain on a tabletop @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the surprise in question is displayed in figure [ arch ] . </S>",
    "<S> one free end of an orderly monolayer of chain is rapidly pulled along a table , leading to the formation of a slowly growing , wobbling , noisy arch near the pick - up point . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon is not unique to chains , and may be observed in strings , ropes @xcite , and similar objects ; we will use the words `` chain '' and `` string '' interchangeably in what follows . </S>",
    "<S> we will suggest a mechanism for this robust behavior by considering the simplest analytical and numerical systems resembling that of figure [ arch ] : an inextensible string , and a chain of beads and springs .    </S>",
    "<S> 2 mm , the amplitude of the initial condition is @xmath05 cm , the imposed velocity of the pulled end is @xmath08 m / s.,width=412 ]    given a time - dependent curve @xmath1 parametrized by arc length @xmath2 , the wave equation @xmath3 describes a balance of inertia and line tension in a string of uniform mass density @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the stress @xmath5 , morally equivalent to the pressure in a one - dimensional fluid , is a multiplier field enforcing the metrical constraint @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this equation is , in principle , derivable as the zero - radius limit of an elastic rod , or the continuum limit of a chain of rigid links . </S>",
    "<S> taking an arc length derivative of and projecting along the unit tangent @xmath7 yields the auxiliary equation @xmath8 the solution of which serves to impose the constraint @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the `` screening potential '' of this poisson - like equation is the squared curvature @xmath9 , while the `` source '' term on the right hand side has been rewritten in terms of the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent using @xmath10 . from this form </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that the stresses induced by inertial motions of the string will be tensile unless one imposes compression through boundary or initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> positivity of the stress is proven for one fixed and one free end @xcite , and the proof may be extended to other conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we will not generally be concerned with unstable evanescent dynamics that might arise from imaginary wave speeds in .    </S>",
    "<S> relevant to our problem are a class of solutions to and for which the curve motion is a pure tangential velocity @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath13 is arbitrary and @xmath11 and @xmath14 are uniform along the curve @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the shape @xmath13 itself is simply one of two waves , namely that which travels at speed @xmath15 with respect to the lagrangian frame of moving at speed @xmath11 along the curve . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus stationary in the laboratory frame ; this and the linear dispersion inherent when @xmath16 is uniform are used to great effect in certain kinetic sculptures @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> how important is gravity ? </S>",
    "<S> the addition of a uniform term @xmath17 to the right hand side of breaks the degeneracy in @xmath13 and may generate compressive stresses . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining stationary - shape solutions of this augmented equation are the catenaries @xcite with the tangential velocity @xmath11 determining the tension , not the shape . </S>",
    "<S> given that compression ( @xmath18 ) corresponds to catastrophic failure , we can naively assume inertial stabilization of a symmetric catenary arch @xmath19 , @xmath20 a negative constant , bearing a tension @xmath21 , as long as the length parameters of the shape fall within a circle whose radius is the natural length scale defined by the velocity and gravity : @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> at this point , it is worth recalling the scales involved in figure [ arch ] . </S>",
    "<S> the terminal `` free stream '' tangential velocity @xmath23 8 m / s , @xmath24 is earth gravity ( @xmath0 10 m / s@xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 10 /m for the duration of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the ratio of inertial to gravitational accelerations , @xmath27 , is at least on the order of fifty to a hundred . </S>",
    "<S> so gravity is neglectable in this system , due to the large curvature that spontaneously emerges early in the process . </S>",
    "<S> gravity will only become relevant given sufficient growth time , or a stiffer curve with a bending or twisting length scale that could set a lower bound on the initial emergent curvature . adding a rigid motion with comparable velocity to the analysis a wobbling perpendicular to the catenary s plane , for example does not change the order of magnitude of the relevant terms .    </S>",
    "<S> returning to our original equations and , let s consider an initially planar curve @xmath13 with a small perturbation @xmath28 oriented perpendicularly to the plane containing @xmath13 . to first order in the perturbation , we have the decoupled equations @xmath29 which imply that @xmath30 and the height function @xmath31 moves through a stress background determined entirely by the planar dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> what should this stress profile look like for an unfurling planar string ? </S>",
    "<S> modulo the periodic component of the motion induced by the initial chain layout , material particles take heteroclinic trajectories between two arbitrary stationary shapes with tangential velocities of zero in the pile and the imposed pulling velocity @xmath11 downstream . </S>",
    "<S> these shapes correspond to stresses of zero and @xmath32 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> although one might expect velocity and stress discontinuities right at the moving front , we do observe a smooth transition region for the velocity in the experiment @xcite , which presumably corresponds to a smooth transition in stress . </S>",
    "<S> a nonperiodic , or temporally averaged , part of the dynamics appears to be nearly steady ; the arch grows slowly and remains within a nearly constant distance from the front . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , equations and indicate that time - dependent curves correspond to nonuniform , but not necessarily time - dependent , stress profiles ; large periodic deformations of the string do not imply similar features in the stress . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we introduce the traveling wave variable @xmath33 and provisionally presume a steady stress @xmath34 in the corresponding frame . in this frame , </S>",
    "<S> eulerian with respect to the curve but not the laboratory , we may approximate the slowly evolving dynamics with the equation @xmath35 this is a short - time description of @xmath36 that presumes smallness of second order time derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> it admits general solutions , for which the characteristics converge at infinite time , of the form @xmath37 , @xmath38 an arbitrary function . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ twotime ] compares the evolution of a wave packet under and the integrated form of for a tanh - shaped @xmath34 that interpolates between zero and the free stream stress @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> agreement is good for early times , when the packet is squeezed into a smaller footprint behind the free stream . </S>",
    "<S> the disturbance eventually reaches a nearly stationary configuration _ via _ a complicated modulated motion , not captured by the first order transport equation . note that squeezing the packet does not increase its amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> these transient , geometrically linearized dynamics are best expressed in a new variable , the `` slack '' @xmath39 taken up into the height function . in terms of @xmath40 , takes the form @xmath41 given a monotonically increasing @xmath42 , the right hand side of is composed of an amplification and an advection term . </S>",
    "<S> these are the ingredients for a convectively unstable system @xcite . however , in contrast to the open flow systems usually considered in this context , both the amplification and advection coefficients in drop to zero as the material particle moves downstream through a stress field that smoothly approaches its free stream value . </S>",
    "<S> the slack pools behind the free stream , as shown in the lower inset of figure [ twotime ] . </S>",
    "<S> this should correspond to a location near the upstream base of the arch .    </S>",
    "<S> , where @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> lower right inset : the evolution of the slack variable @xmath39 under ( full black curves ) for @xmath45 , at times @xmath51 , as viewed in a frame eulerian on the string , with the downstream direction to the right and the horizontal axis representing @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition at @xmath47 is uniform : @xmath52 , width=412 ]    in the experiment , this transient , localized slope amplifier was coupled to a height rectifier , namely a table . </S>",
    "<S> is this sufficient for the formation of an arch ? to explore this question , </S>",
    "<S> we have implemented a simple verlet integration @xcite of massive beads and stiff springs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while introducing extensibility , we exclude bending and twist elasticity , air drag , frictional interactions with the table , and any other messy and experimentally unavoidable physics . </S>",
    "<S> the 5000 beads begin sinusoidally arranged in a plane defined by the potential minimum created by a constant `` gravity '' perpendicular to a hard plane `` table '' , an exponential with argument 100 at a penetration depth of one spring rest length . </S>",
    "<S> a velocity in the direction of the sine s argument is imposed on one end bead . </S>",
    "<S> a small quantity of uniform noise is added to the vertical force density on each bead at all times , and there is also a damping coefficient which falls exponentially towards zero from an initial value of a few percent .    the snapshot of shape , stress , and height in figure [ mimic ] is the result of a simulation with initial layout amplitude and frequency of @xmath06 cm and @xmath00.6 cycles / cm , parameters similar to figure [ arch ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have set @xmath53 , and the half - width of the uniform noise distribution is @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the extensions of the springs are used as a proxy for stress , and these data are spatially averaged . </S>",
    "<S> an initial attenuating pulse travels down the chain , leaving a nearly quiescent wake , followed by a rapid transition to the free - stream stress @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this very noisy stress plateau also carries oscillations due to the undamped lateral motions of the chain arising from its initial configuration . </S>",
    "<S> an arch does indeed form , on the downstream side of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of gravity in the simulation is rather minimal , affecting only the qualitative shape of the arch . </S>",
    "<S> however , in simulations without the table and gravity potentials , the slack is nt rectified , and no arch forms . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics are quite robust with respect to changes in the spring constant . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations shown in this letter involve strains of about 2.5% in the plateau , but the important features are quite similar for strains an order of magnitude larger or smaller . </S>",
    "<S> we note in passing that the damping term in the dynamics causes effects comparable to those of a noise source . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative behavior shown here persists as long as the noise is above a threshold value , which is on the order of @xmath55-@xmath56 in the absence of damping .    ) after 150 ms for a configuration with initial layout amplitude and frequency of @xmath06 cm and @xmath00.6 cycles / cm . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity boundary condition is imposed on bead # 5000 . </S>",
    "<S> a portion of the corresponding three - dimensional shape is shown in an oblique view in the upper left inset . </S>",
    "<S> spring rest lengths are 2 mm , and the strain corresponding to a stress of 1 is 2.5% . </S>",
    "<S> the raw stress data extend from approximately -9 to + 11 in the noisy plateau region . </S>",
    "<S> noise from a uniform distribution of half - width @xmath54 is added to vertical force densities ; this may be compared to @xmath57 and spring force densities on the order of @xmath58.,width=480 ]    we return to our assumption of a steady stress distribution in the traveling wave frame . </S>",
    "<S> figures [ pullhi ] and [ pulllo ] show snapshots of two chains at three identical times . </S>",
    "<S> the chain of figure [ pullhi ] is that of figure [ mimic ] , while that of figure [ pulllo ] corresponds to an initial arrangement with similar amplitude but lower frequency , @xmath06 cm and @xmath00.1 cycles / cm , and the same level of added noise . the high - frequency chain appears to sustain a steady , or perhaps very slowly growing , transition region between low and high velocity , and is highly receptive to noise . </S>",
    "<S> the transition region moves approximately 6 - 7 beads / ms upstream , not much faster than the traveling wave coordinate ( 5 beads / ms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transition region on the low - frequency chain steadily widens as the chain unfurls , its leading edge moving significantly faster upstream ( 9 - 11 beads / ms ) , and out - of - plane growth is slower to develop and less pronounced . over the time interval shown </S>",
    "<S> , this region retains much qualitative information about its initial shape even as the material within it has achieved highly tangential velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the stress on this chain appears to reflect this ordered arrangement , but the nature of the pulse train in figure [ pulllo ] remains unknown . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of our steady stress assumption apparently depends on the initial conditions , specifically the curvature , or screening , of the string . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that , for both of the initial layouts shown , there are regions of chain in which the averaged stress becomes compressive for brief periods . </S>",
    "<S> these appear to behave as sources of slack for the system to amplify .    ) after 55 , 175 , and 295 ms for a configuration with initial layout amplitude and frequency of @xmath06 cm and @xmath00.6 cycles / cm . </S>",

    "<S> top views of a portion of the corresponding shapes are shown in the upper insets . </S>",
    "<S> other details as for figure [ mimic].,width=528 ]    our preliminary study has raised several questions . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps most interesting is the issue of how to analyze the planar dynamics we see in the insets of figures [ pullhi ] and [ pulllo ] , and the associated stress generation , in terms of the time - dependent screening and source terms of equation . </S>",
    "<S> there is some sort of signal being transmitted along our string , conveying information about the velocity boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the process of transmission is highly dependent on the evolving shape of the curve , and thus more complicated than transverse impulsive loading of a straight string @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interesting physics arises from gradients in the stress , which are absent in the klein - gordon - type equations describing the perturbative dynamics around stationary states of elastic rods @xcite , though we note that a uniform but time - varying tension is known to cause instabilities of planar motions of fixed - end strings @xcite . what slowly evolving stress distributions can be sustained by moving elastic curves ? and which spatially developing motions will inevitably bear structures like our arch ? </S>",
    "<S> are there analogous phenomena in elastic sheets , nets , fluid membranes , or the navier - stokes equations in certain geometries ? </S>",
    "<S> incompressibility of the system appears merely an analytical convenience , not a strict requirement . </S>",
    "<S> do short - lived zones of compressive stress only appear in compressible systems , and are they important ? finally , we have disregarded the periodic aspects of the curve s motion , and still lack an explicit description of the role of the rectifying potential . </S>",
    "<S> is it possible to describe the arch growth as a secular result of some forcing by the table , perhaps on the highly curved turning points , or is the resemblance to a resonance superficial ? </S>"
