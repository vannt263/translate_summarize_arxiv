    "beginning with the early work of thouless  @xcite , quasi one - dimensional conductors have provided a valuable arena in which to explore the influence of quantum interference effects on the transport properties of weakly disordered phase coherent conductors . by the early 80 s ,",
    "a complete scaling theory of localization in multi - mode wires had been formulated by dorokhov  @xcite ( and developed later by mello , pereyra and kumar  @xcite ) as a brownian motion of eigenvalues of the transmission matrix  the ` dmpk equation ' ( for a recent review see , e.g. , ref .  ) . for several symmetry classes , analytic results for the low moments of conductance",
    "were obtained in both the metallic and strongly localized regimes  @xcite . lately , a third , and potentially more versatile approach has been developed to investigate quantum transport in ( multi - terminal ) disordered conductors . by formally relating the transmission eigenvalue distribution to a ` multi - component green s function ' ( see below ) , nazarov has shown  @xcite that known results in the metallic limit can be inferred from the equations of motion of the average quasi - classical green function  @xcite .",
    "the transport properties of a conductor are fully specified by the transmission matrix @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the landauer - bttiker formula allows the conductance to be expressed through eigenvalues @xmath2 of the ` squared ' transmission matrix , @xmath3 the statistics of the @xmath2 follow the universal dorokhov distribution , valid in the metallic limit ( i.e. where the dimensionless conductance @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 by solving the corresponding quasi - classical equation in the diffusive limit , eq .",
    "( [ dorokhov ] ) has been established under very general conditions . yet , while the method introduced by nazarov is capable of describing accurately the transmission eigenvalue distribution in the metallic phase , the method fails to account for the phenomena of weak and strong localization .    in recent years",
    ", the development of a field theoretic technique to explore phase coherence phenomena in disordered conductors has exposed the strengths and limitations of the quasi - classical scheme .",
    "weakly disordered conductors and superconductors can be classified into one of ten symmetry classes  @xcite , their spectral and transport properties specified by a field theory of nonlinear @xmath0-model type  @xcite .",
    "it was realized that within the formally exact framework provided by the field theory , the quasi - classical equations of motion represent a saddle - point or mean - field approximation , involving only a single field configuration  @xcite .",
    "indeed , drawing on the substantial literature on the quasi - classical equations in the superconducting context ( the eilenberger  @xcite and usadel  @xcite equations ) , this identification simplified substantially the analysis of physical realizations of the ` novel symmetry ' classes of disordered superconductors introduced by altland and zirnbauer  @xcite .",
    "the absence of localization in the quasi - classical theory follows then from the neglect of fluctuations about this field configuration .",
    "describing localization within the @xmath0-model is however far from trivial .",
    "while weak localization corrections to transport can be developed as a systematic perturbation theory , the transition to strong localization is signalled by the growth of contributions non - perturbative in the conductance .",
    "indeed , a calculation by rejaei  @xcite of the exact transmission eigenvalue distribution relied on a mapping of the @xmath0-model for the quasi one - dimensional system onto a heat kernel ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "such an analysis affords little intuition into the origin of localization within the framework of the @xmath0-model .",
    "in particular , can the transition ( or , in quasi one - dimension , the crossover ) to strong localization be understood in terms of certain @xmath0-model field configurations ?",
    "a preliminary answer to this question was provided in an insightful work by muzykantskii and khmelnitskii  @xcite . using the field theoretic approach",
    ", it was demonstrated that the long - time response of a weakly disordered quasi one - dimensional wire to a voltage step was controlled by spatially inhomogeneous saddle - point field configurations of the @xmath0-model action .",
    "non - perturbative in the conductance , these field configurations were associated with rare `` anomalously localized '' states embedded deep within the metallic phase . whether these states provided a caricature of states near",
    "the anderson transition remains to date the subject of debate .",
    "later , in a related activity , it was shown the nucleation of localized quasi - particle states inside the gap of a weakly disordered symmetry broken superconductor were ascribed to spatially inhomogeneous saddle - point configurations of the action  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will show that , for a range of symmetry classes , the physics of strong localization is captured _ exactly _ by the inclusion of a set of new saddle points combined with their associated gaussian fluctuations .",
    "this recalls a previous investigation by andreev and altshuler  @xcite of energy level correlations in symmetry broken ( zero - dimensional ) chaotic systems  random matrix ensembles belonging to the unitary symmetry class . there it was shown that the two - point correlator of the density of states could be fully recovered from the inclusion of two saddle points together with their associated gaussian fluctuations . in both cases , the coincidence can be traced to the property of semiclassical exactness shared by the different @xmath0-model field theories .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to elucidate this principle in the quasi one - dimensional system comparing results for transmission eigenvalue distributions to those obtained from heat kernel methods .",
    "the novel view of localization presented here may inform the treatment of more complicated problems .",
    "following rejaei , our analysis rests on a relation which allows the ensemble average of the generating function of the transmission matrix @xmath6 ( at a particular energy ) of a quasi one - dimensional sample @xmath7 to be presented as a partition function of a nonlinear @xmath0-model of the appropriate symmetry class . the density of transmission eigenvalues may then be extracted using the relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 denote the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath10 . from this function",
    "one can infer the transmission eigenvalue density through the relation @xmath11 the moments of the transmission matrix can be cast in terms of the retarded and advanced green s functions @xmath12 of the microscopic hamiltonian of the wire as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the current operator through left and right cross - sections at @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , and the trace on the right hand side runs over spatial coordinates .",
    "following nazarov , it is helpful to note that the determinants in eq .",
    "( [ tgen ] ) can be recast in terms of a multi - component green s function according to the relation @xmath17 where , for example , in the case of the numerator of ( [ tgen ] ) , @xmath18 .",
    "thus the generating function @xmath19 may be related to the green s function of an enlarged hamiltonian , which includes an off - diagonal ` vector potential ' .    with this representation in hand",
    ", the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in the next section we present a complete analysis of the localization properties of class @xmath20i , one of the superconducting symmetry classes introduced by altland and zirnbauer  @xcite .",
    "we outline the @xmath0-model description of this symmetry class and reproduce nazarov s calculation in this context , before introducing the full set of saddle - point trajectories - geodesics on the target space - and performing a complete semiclassical calculation . from the latter",
    "we will extract the transmission eigenvalue density and mean conductance .",
    "the exactness of the results obtained are then verified by heat kernel methods . in the following section",
    ", the techniques developed above will be applied to two additional symmetry classes that are amenable to such a treatment . finally , in the last section",
    ", we will draw conclusions .",
    "superconductors which exhibit both time reversal symmetry and spin rotation invariance belong to symmetry class @xmath20i . by introducing the familiar nambu doublet of electron and hole operators in what we will refer to as the ` particle - hole ' ( ph ) space , in the mean - field approximation",
    ", the quasi - particle gorkov or bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent real symmetric matrix elements corresponding to the non - interacting single - particle hamiltonian of the quasi one - dimensional disordered wire and the superconducting order parameter respectively . with this structure ,",
    "the matrix hamiltonian @xmath25 satisfies the symmetry relations @xmath26 which in turn implies the identity @xmath27 between the retarded and advanced green s functions .      with this definition",
    ", the ratio of determinants which specifies the generating function  ( [ tgen ] ) can be conveniently expressed via a supersymmetric field integral , with the numerator arising from a fermionic integral and the denominator from its bosonic counterpart .",
    "since these are not identical , the corresponding partition function will inherit boundary conditions which break the supersymmetry . to identify the soft diffusion modes of the superconducting system",
    ", it is convenient to effect a doubling of the field space of the supervectors @xmath28 to include a ` charge - conjugation ' ( cc ) space  @xcite @xmath29 focusing on the transmission eigenvalue distribution at @xmath30 , we notice that if @xmath31 is the @xmath32 component of the matrix green s function @xmath33 in the cc space , then the advanced component @xmath34 is just the ( 2,2 ) component .",
    "thus the enlarged structure required is just the usual cc space .",
    "altogether , this leads to the representation @xmath35}^{{{\\cal g}}^{-1}}\\psi\\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denote the pauli matrices in the cc space .    once cast in the form of a functional field integral , it is a straightforward ( if somewhat lengthy ) and standard procedure to show that the low - energy properties of the partition function are contained with an effective field theory of nonlinear @xmath0-model type ( for a detailed discussion of the explicit derivation , we refer to one of the many standard references , e.g. ref .",
    "two points should be remarked upon .",
    "the first is that , since class @xmath20i has two symmetries  particle - hole and time reversal ( tr ) symmetry ( see eq .",
    "[ phsym ] )  the supervector needs to be doubled _ twice_. the size of the supermatrix field @xmath39 that appears at an intermediate stage in the derivation is thus @xmath40 ( ph@xmath41cc@xmath41tr@xmath41bf ) , but this is quickly reduced to the @xmath42 field @xmath43 by @xmath44 on the saddle - point manifold ( @xmath45 denote the pauli matrices in ph space ) , with the ph space then disappearing from view . secondly ,",
    "following rejaei , the ` vector potential ' associated with the coupling of the wire to the external leads , can be absorbed into a rigid boundary condition on the field integral .",
    "taking the metallic contacts at @xmath46 to be to clean normal conducting leads , the ensemble averaged partition function assumes the form ( with @xmath47 )    @xmath48 ^ 2 \\right)\\ ; , \\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the field integral is over @xmath42 supermatrix fields @xmath43 subject to the nonlinear constraint @xmath49 .",
    "finally , the supersymmetry breaking source terms enter the boundary condition , through the rotation matrix @xmath50 specifically , if we choose @xmath51 then the boundary condition at @xmath16 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and we have obtained the required form of rejaei s relation ( [ tgen ] ) .",
    "an alternative approach that matches nazarov s orginal formulation is to use the explicit expression for @xmath54 that follows from eq .",
    "( [ fdef ] ) and relate it directly to the green s function in the cc space , i.e. @xmath55\\right\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ * & = & \\left\\langle\\mathrm{tr}_{\\bf r}\\left [ \\hat v_r   { { \\cal g}}^{12}_{\\mathrm{bb } } \\right]\\right\\rangle\\big|_{\\theta = i\\phi}\\nonumber\\\\ * & = & -\\frac{i\\pi\\nu d}{2 } { { \\cal a}}\\left\\langle \\mathrm{tr}_{\\mathrm{tr } } \\left(q\\partial_x q\\right)^{12}_{bb}\\big|_{x=0 } \\right\\rangle_q\\big|_{\\theta = i\\phi } , \\label{nazf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 denotes an average with respect to the @xmath0-model action  ( [ sigma ] ) , @xmath57 is the cross - sectional area , and @xmath58 is the single particle density of states .",
    "@xmath59 denotes the trace over the tr space .",
    "henceforth , we will work only with the one - dimensional field @xmath60 , assuming that the width of the wire is much smaller than the localization length .      to develop a theory of localization from the field integral ,",
    "it is first useful to establish contact with the theoretical framework introduced by nazarov . as discussed in the introduction , the quasi - classical theory formulated by nazarov",
    "is contained within the saddle - point structure of the present action : specifically , a variation of the action with respect to @xmath43 subject to the nonlinear constraint , @xmath61 , obtains the saddle - point equation @xmath62 which expresses conservation of the matrix current @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , associating @xmath43 with the average quasi - classical green function , the saddle - point equation can be interpreted as the generalization of the quasi - classical equation derived in nazarov s early work to the superconducting wire .",
    "the simplest solution satisfying the given boundary conditions is block diagonal in the bf space and takes the form @xmath64 if one inserts this solution into eq .",
    "( [ nazf ] ) , and neglects field fluctuations around the saddle point , one finds @xmath65 then , making use of eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) , one can straightforwardly recover the dorokhov distribution ( [ dorokhov ] ) for a wire of dimensionless conductance @xmath66 .",
    "however , when derived from the supersymmetric field theory , one can see that the saddle - point equation presents not just one solution , but a whole family of solutions in the compact fermionic sector @xmath67 thus we see that even at the level of a purely _ semi - classical _ analysis , nazarov s treatment is missing two elements ; corrections associated with fluctuations around the conventional saddle - point solution  ( [ nazsol ] ) , and solutions  ( [ windings ] ) that loop multiply around the compact fermionic sector .",
    "we will show that these two ` channels ' of corrections are , respectively , responsible for the phenomenon of weak localization  as , indeed , one might have guessed from the connection between the role of fluctuations in the @xmath0-model and diagrammatic perturbation theory  and strong localization .    to uncover this relation , in the following",
    "we will undertake the semi - classical analysis taking into account fluctuations of the matrix fields at quadratic order around both the conventional and the non - trivial saddle - point field configurations .      to perform the field integration over the fluctuations ,",
    "it is necessary to review the structure of the target manifold . for the minimal ( @xmath68 ) nonlinear @xmath0-model associated with the symmetry class @xmath20i , the target space",
    " spanned by matrices @xmath69  turns out  @xcite to be in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath70 , by which we mean the lie group @xmath71 extended to an orthosymplectic lie supergroup .",
    "this group structure of the target manifold is the reason for the exactness of the semi - classical approximation  @xcite .",

    "if @xmath113 is some complex number , the operator @xmath114 on that hilbert space has eigenfunctions @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , with eigenvalues @xmath117 , so its ( unregularized ) determinant is given by @xmath118 taking the logarithmic differential ( to kill the @xmath113independent infinity ) one obtains @xmath119 therefore , @xmath120 and the above ratio of four determinants gives @xmath121 finally , when combined with the exponential of the classical action and summed over @xmath122 , one obtains the following expression for the partition function : @xmath123    note that the operator @xmath124 starts to exhibit negative eigenvalues as soon as @xmath125 exceeds @xmath126 .",

    "thus what we have done  evaluating the functional integral in the gaussian approximation around all of the saddle points ( without paying attention to question of existence ) , and summing contributions  was a purely formal calculation .",
    "nevertheless , the answer obtained in this way turns out to be exact !",
    "indeed , the validity of this expression can be established both directly and indirectly . in the following",
    ", we will motivate this conclusion by investigating the transmission eigenvalue density and the mean conductance from the partition function .",
    "then , by interpreting the field integral as a heat kernel , we will find an alternative exact method of computation .      with the partition function in hand",

    "all higher - order terms of the perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath82 turn out to vanish identically , a direct manifestation of semi - classical exactness .",

    "lately , it has been discussed @xcite in the context of the quasi - particle properties of a @xmath98-wave superconductor subject to a smooth random potential .",
    "previous studies of quasi one - dimensional systems in this class  @xcite have revealed a surprisingly rich behaviour , including localization - delocalization transitions with a number of critical points .      before exploring the properties of the nonlinear @xmath0-model action ,",
    "it is first necessary to confirm the form of rejaei s relation for this symmetry class . for this",
    "we refer to the @xmath0-model formulation of the bond disordered quasi one - dimensional chain given by altland and merkt  @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath221 chains of @xmath222 sites with hopping matrix element @xmath223 along the chains between sites @xmath224 and @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is a ` staggering ' parameter . in the following ,",
    "we suppose that a weak disorder potential ( which , further , lifts time - reversal symmetry ) of strength @xmath227 couples the chains .",
    "we view the single particle hilbert space as the product @xmath228 , with the first factor referring to the odd and even numbered sites along the chain .    the sublattice symmetry of the hamiltonian translates to the condition @xmath229 , where @xmath38 represent the pauli matrices in this odd / even subspace .",
    "from this sublattice symmetry there follows the relation @xmath230 the corresponding current operator is simply given by @xmath231 ( if we ignore the disorder and staggering , or evaluate it in the clean , unstaggered leads ) .",
    "thus the moments of the transmission matrix at zero energy are given by @xmath232 where @xmath233 projects onto the @xmath234 site of each chain .",
    "it seems that these moments can not in general be presented as the coefficients in some expansion of a functional determinant .",
    "the average conductance ( @xmath235 ) may however be obtained as the @xmath236 coefficient of the determinant of a hamiltonian with hopping @xmath237 between the @xmath238 and @xmath239 sites , and @xmath240 between the @xmath241 and @xmath242 sites ( since hopping is described by a @xmath243 term in the hamiltonian ) .",
    "we may thus study the usual partition function @xmath244 for @xmath245 ( the matrix @xmath170 being @xmath246 ) .",
    "the conductance can be then identified with the coefficient @xmath146 in the expansion @xmath247      the most general nonlinear @xmath0-model lagrangian for quasi one - dimensional systems belonging to class @xmath165iii ( and in suitable units of length )",
    "depends on two parameters @xmath248 : @xmath249 the target space of the nonlinear @xmath0-model for this class @xcite is of type @xmath250 and is obtained from the complex lie supergroup @xmath251 by picking @xmath252 in the boson - boson sector and @xmath253 in the fermion - fermion sector . for @xmath254",
    "these are @xmath255 and @xmath204 respectively .",
    "the exponential parametrization @xmath209 of the target space is achieved by setting @xmath256 with real commuting variables @xmath257 and anti - commuting variables @xmath258 .",
    "again , @xmath259 parameterizes the maximal abelian subgroup .",
    "based on the geodesics @xmath260 with @xmath261 , the semiclassical approximation for @xmath262 is found to be    @xmath263 / 4 t } \\;.\\ ] ]    expanding the result above for the partition function , and using eq .",
    "( [ condrel ] ) gives @xmath264 where the second expression is obtained by poisson resummation of the first .",
    "the result ( [ aiiicond ] ) depends periodically on the parameter @xmath265 with period @xmath193 .",
    "in fact , @xmath74 has the meaning of a topological angle . from ref .",
    "we know that tuning @xmath74 from @xmath266 to @xmath193 amounts to changing by two the number of channels ( which is assumed to be large in order for the @xmath0-model approximation be valid ) . in terms of the bond disordered chains discussed earlier @xmath267 where @xmath268 is the staggering parameter @xmath226 scaled by the strength of the disorder .",
    "we see that without staggering , a delocalized state appears only for odd channel number .",
    "the localization length diverges with critical exponent @xmath269 as the staggering approaches the critical values @xmath270 .",
    "if class @xmath165iii is realized by dirac fermions in a random abelian gauge field , the parameter @xmath271 measures the strength of the gauge disorder .",
    "although the lagrangian @xmath272 at first sight would seem to become unstable at @xmath273 ( the coefficient of @xmath274 becomes negative there ) , this is not really so .",
    "what matters is the _ full _ quadratic form @xmath275 which has the jordan normal matrix form @xmath276 , and is invertible for any @xmath277 .",
    "in fact , the final result ( [ aiiicond ] ) reveals a smooth dependence of the mean conductance on @xmath277 for all physical values ( @xmath271 ) including the fake singularity @xmath273 .      finally ,",
    "seeking an exact solution through the heat kernel , an exact calculation of @xmath278 is still possible as the hamiltonian @xmath279 obtained by canonical quantization from @xmath272 can once again be transformed to euclidean form : @xmath280 with @xmath281 . by solving the differential equation @xmath282 with the appropriate @xmath283-function initial conditions at @xmath284",
    ", we exactly recover the semiclassical answer ( [ aiiikern ] ) .",
    "we have confirmed the exactness of our semiclassical analysis for symmetry classes @xmath20i , @xmath197iii , and @xmath165iii . by simply summing over the saddle points of the classical action",
    " recall that these differed by the length of the geodesic looping around the compact fermion - fermion submanifold of the theory  and treating the fluctuations in the gaussian approximation , we have obtained the exact result for the partition function .",
    "the underlying reason for the exactness of our calculations is that the path integral on the @xmath0-model manifolds considered here satisfies an infinite - dimensional generalisation of the duistermaat - heckman theorem  @xcite .",
    "that is , the integration manifold in eq .",
    "[ g_action ] , being related to the space @xmath285 of based loops in @xmath160 , is symplectic with liouville measure , and the action is the momentum mapping on this manifold .",
    "we have discussed all the symmetry classes where the @xmath0-model target space has a group - like structure , and thus exhausted the situations in which the semiclassical approach is exact .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that this approach may inform future investigations of more taxing localization problems .",
    "one very interesting extension that could be tackled in a similar manner is the critical scaling of the localization length near the band center in situations where zero energy is described by class @xmath197iii or @xmath165iii .",
    "this lies outside of the scope of methods like the dmpk equation .",
    "let us review the structure of the @xmath0-model target space for class @xmath20i . the construction used in ref .",
    "is based on ` copying ' the symmetries of the hamiltonian to symmetries of the auxiliary space of the @xmath286-field . for class @xmath20i ( particle - hole and time reversal symmetry ) , this is achieved by demanding that the fields satisfy @xmath287 the subscript @xmath288 is to remind us that in the formulation of ref .   the variables @xmath289 and @xmath290 are ( super)_matrices _ mapping the auxiliary space to the physical hilbert space ( where the hamiltonian acts ) , and vice versa . in the present case we work with the more traditional column and row supervectors @xmath291 and @xmath292 , since :    * in the localization problem the @xmath39 field used to decouple the term arising from potential disorder retains the hilbert space structure of the hamiltonian ( particle hole space and spatial index ) , whereas in the random matrix problem that structure is lost on averaging and , more importantly , * we use some of the additional structure ( the cc space ) to enlarge our hamiltonian ( eq .  [ enlargedh ] ) .    transcribing the conditions ( [ matrixcond ] ) for supervectors gives @xmath293 where we used the fact that @xmath294 and @xmath295 can be chosen to be orthogonal matrices",
    "now in the localization problem @xmath39 is a @xmath40 matrix ( ph@xmath41cc@xmath41tr@xmath41bf - by ` tr ' we mean the space to accommodate time reversal symmetry ) , so we need to check that the conditions ( [ vectorcond ] ) give rise to a @xmath0-model with the same @xmath42 space as in the random matrix problem .",
    "this is straightforwardly verified following ref .   by observing that @xmath296 ( we drop the @xmath297 subscript from now on ) ,",
    "arising from a decoupling of potential disorder , has the symmetry @xmath298 the saddle - point manifold is spanned by @xmath299 or @xmath300 thus ( [ qsym ] ) implies that the symmetries of the @xmath42 field @xmath43 are @xmath301 which are the same relations found in ref .  .",
    "to construct an embedding of the @xmath302 matrix group - valued field @xmath170 in @xmath43 requires an explicit choice of @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "we use @xmath303 @xmath304 where @xmath305 are the pauli matrices in tr space , and @xmath306 and @xmath307 are projectors in the bose - bose and fermi - fermi sectors .",
    "note that the structure of the vector in cc space in the bosonic sector is in fact then _ not _ given by eq .",
    "[ ccdoubling ] , but rather looks like @xmath308 fortunately this does nt change the boundary conditions .",
    "now the correct embedding is obtained by finding a transformation to diagonalize the matrix @xmath309 @xmath310 while simultaneously sending @xmath311 why ?",
    "the point is that the set of @xmath312 s that preserve the symmetries ( [ qsym ] ) takes the form @xmath313 in such a basis .",
    "the stability group of transformations that send @xmath314 is then given by eq .",
    "[ tdef ] with @xmath315 , so that the saddle - point manifold is parameterized by @xmath316 an explicit form for @xmath317 is @xmath318 let us verify that this takes the maximal abelian subgroup @xmath165 to the @xmath43 matrices of the form ( [ bc ] ) : @xmath319 finally , the form of the action ( [ g_action ] ) in terms of @xmath170 follows from @xmath320 ^ 2&=&2\\,\\mathrm{str}\\left [ \\nabla g\\nabla g^{-1 } \\right]\\\\ & = & -2\\,\\mathrm{str}\\left [ g^{-1}\\nabla g \\right]^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]"
