    "the interplay between disorder and interactions is one of the most exciting topics in mesoscopic physics .",
    "both factors play an important role in determining the change of the number of electrons in a mesoscopic system as the chemical potential of the system is changed .",
    "the investigation of this problem is especially timely since ground - state properties of disordered interacting systems have recently become experimentally accessible .",
    "for example , by measuring the spacings between the gate voltages for which a quantum dot connected to external leads exhibits conductance peaks , one can infer the inverse compressibility of the electron gas in the dot @xcite .",
    "devices of this type have recently been used to measure the many - particle ground - state energy as a function of the number of electrons in a dot and large fluctuations ( compared to the single electron level spacing ) in this property were observed@xcite .",
    "large fluctuations have also been observed in earlier experiments in which the inverse compressibility of an insulating indium - oxide wire was measured @xcite .    in the absence of interactions the derivative of the chemical potential @xmath0 with respect to the number of electrons @xmath1 (",
    "i.e. , the inverse compressibility , equal also to the second derivative with respect to @xmath1 of the ground state energy ) of a system equals to the single - electron level spacing .",
    "it is well known that the single - electron level statistics in disordered systems are connected to the statistical properties of random matrices @xcite .",
    "the level spacings exhibit fluctuations and therefore one expects that the inverse compressibility of different samples , as well as the inverse compressibility for the same sample at different chemical potentials , will also exhibit fluctuations of order of the single - electron mean level spacing @xmath2 . in the non - interacting regime",
    "there are many theoretical approaches which can be used to calculate these fluctuations , among them are the random matrix theory ( rmt)@xcite , perturbative diagrammatic calculations @xcite and the supersymmetry method @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "once electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions are included the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "in contrast to the high energy excitations of an interacting system for which a rmt description works very well ( for example the high excitations of a nuclei@xcite and of disordered interacting systems@xcite ) , the _ ground - state _ energy of an interacting system as a function of the number of particles can not be understood by means of rmt .",
    "the average compressibility @xmath3 , as well as the average capacitance @xmath4 , are expected to decrease as result of interactions since it costs more energy to add particles into the system .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the situation for the average polarizability suppression by the e - e interactions @xcite .",
    "it is not a priori clear how the interactions will influence the fluctuations .",
    "previously we have calculated the influence of e - e interactions on the sample - to - sample fluctuations of the polarizability @xcite . by analogy",
    "one might expect that the relative magnitude of the compressibility and capacitance fluctuations should be suppressed .",
    "the average inverse compressibility @xmath5 is expected to increase as a function of interaction strength for repulsive interactions . from the experimental evidence it seems that the fluctuations in the inverse compressibility is proportional to @xmath5 @xcite . from numerical calculations one learns that for strong interactions the mean root square of the inverse compressibility are proportional to its average@xcite , with a proportionality constant of about @xmath6 for a very wide range of interactions and disorder strengths .",
    "however , it is evident that for weak interactions this ratio can not be constant .",
    "our goal is to study the behavior of the inverse compressibility for weak interactions , and to understand the transition to the strong interaction regime .    in this paper",
    "we extend the perturbative diagrammatic calculations to include e - e interactions .",
    "the average compressibility , capacitance and inverse compressibility as a function of the interaction strength are calculated .",
    "the fluctuations in the compressibility and capacitance are found to be strongly suppressed by the e - e interactions .",
    "the fluctuations in the the inverse compressibility of the sample can also be deduced from the fluctuations in the compressibility .",
    "it turns out that the fluctuations in the inverse compressibility , while not suppressed are relatively small .",
    "this is checked by an exact diagonalization numerical study of an interacting , spinless , disordered tight - binding model for nearest - neighbor interactions as well as for long - range coulomb interactions . for weak interactions the numerical results follow the perturbative calculation .",
    "as may be expected from earlier studies , @xcite deviations appear as the strength of interaction is increased .",
    "thus , a transition from weak - interaction behavior of the fluctuations to strong - interaction behavior is evident . in the end",
    "we discuss the significance of these results for the interpretation of the experiments .",
    "the compressibility may be written in terms of the exact green function of the system as : @xmath7 where @xmath0 is the fermi energy of the system , @xmath1 is the number of particles .",
    "given the hamiltonian @xmath8 , the exact green function can be written as @xmath9 for the non - interacting case eqs .",
    "( [ e0],[e0a ] ) take the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the volume and @xmath12 here @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the n - th eigenvector ( eigenvalue ) of the system .",
    "this defines the density of states at the fermi energy @xmath15 @xmath16 according to eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) in order to add one electron to the system the fermi energy should change by @xmath2 .",
    "this can be also represented in a diagrammatic perturbation theory by the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](a ) corresponding to @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes an average over different realizations of disorder .",
    "now let us discuss the influence of e - e interactions on the averaged compressibility .",
    "one would expect that repulsive e - e interactions will reduce the compressibility since it costs additional interaction energy to insert an electron into the system .",
    "we begin by investigating the role of short range interactions represented by @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a dimensionless coupling constant and @xmath22 ; here @xmath23 is the range of the interaction and @xmath24 is the systems dimensionality .",
    "the compressibility in the interacting case may be represented by the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](b ) , corresponding to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the result of summing the diagrammatic series shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) . for a short range interaction @xmath27 inserting the result for @xmath26 into eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) one obtains @xmath28 thus , the additional energy needed to add an electron due to the e - e interactions ( the charging energy ) is @xmath29 .",
    "this is exactly the result expected if one assumes a constant density of electrons in the system .",
    "the calculation of the compressibility for the long - ranged coulomb interaction can be performed along similar lines . for the coulomb interaction @xmath30 and for an infinite system @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) which for future convenience in the numerical simulations may also be written as @xmath34 . as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) the zero mode ( @xmath35 ) determines the behavior of the average compressibility .",
    "therefore , one must treat the zero mode carefully , since simply inserting the infinite system value of the interaction for @xmath35 will lead to no compressibility , i.e. , infinite capacity .",
    "the zero component of the fourier transform for a finite system is equal to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a numerical constant which depends on the geometry . thus repeating the summation of the diagrammatic series shown in fig . [",
    "fig.1](c ) one obtains @xmath38 where @xmath39 , which is the usual random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the e - e interactions . using the above result in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) results in @xmath40 therefore , the compressibility tends to its non - interacting value for @xmath41 ( i.e. , large screening length , possible for example in very small semiconducting grains ) and to @xmath42 of its non - interacting value for @xmath43 ( metallic grains ) .",
    "in this section we shall calculate the fluctuations in the compressibility in the presence of e - e interactions . for the non - interacting electrons",
    "the fluctuations are expected follow the wigner - dyson statistics . as was noted in ref .",
    ", in order to obtain the wigner - dyson statistics in the perturbative diagrammatic calculation one must insert a cut - off in energy ( or temperature ) of order of the single electron level spacing @xmath2 . explicitly the fluctuations can be calculated using the diagrams appearing in fig .",

    "the solution is @xmath52 where @xmath53 , ( for a two dimensional system the @xmath54 component drops out ) and @xmath55 . after inserting the value of diffusion propagator given in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) one is left with the following summation : @xmath56 the most significant contribution comes from the zero mode ( @xmath35 ) resulting in @xmath57    the fluctuations in the interacting case are represented by the diagrams shown in fig . [ fig.2](b ) corresponding to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ e8],[e12 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath60 appears in the power of four , which is the the result of the fact that when two rpa lines intersect , four lines appear . for the short range interactions",
    "we obtain @xmath61 thus , the fluctuations in the compressibility are suppressed by the interactions as compared to the non - interacting value .",
    "even the relative fluctuations ( defined as the fluctuations in the compressibility divided by the averaged compressibility ) are suppressed by the interactions . according to eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) : @xmath62    a similar situation exists also for the coulomb interactions . by using the value of @xmath60 given in eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) one obtains @xmath63 and ( using eq .",
    "( [ e13 ] ) ) @xmath64 thus , for @xmath41 the relative fluctuations are the same as in the non - interacting case , while @xmath43 the relative fluctuations are suppressed by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "it is important to note that for most metallic and semiconducting samples the above relation holds since @xmath66 is of the order of the fermi momentum , i.e. , @xmath67 for a grain with @xmath68 electron .",
    "from the experimental point of view , capacitance measurements is one of the most accessible methods to investigate the spectral properties of quantum dots and grains@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to connect the fluctuations in the compressibility to fluctuations in the capacitance for interacting disordered systems .",
    "the capacitance of a grain @xmath69 may be related to its chemical potential in the following way : @xmath70 which is equivalent to @xmath71 when @xmath43 and thus one may write the average capacitance as @xmath72 after inserting the calculated compressibility for the long - range coulomb interaction ( eq .",
    "( [ e13 ] ) ) one obtains @xmath73 which is the expected purely geometrical value of the capacitance .    the fluctuations in the capacitance can be expressed via the fluctuations in the compressibility in the following way @xmath74 which after inserting eq.([f9 ] ) results in @xmath75 thus when @xmath43 the fluctuations in the capacitance are much smaller than the average capacitance .",
    "as mentioned briefly in the introduction , the inverse compressibility @xmath76 of a quantum dot can be deduced from measurements of the spacings between consecutive gate voltages for which the conductance through the dot peaks .",
    "the spacings in the gate voltage are proportional to the difference between the chemical potential of @xmath77 and @xmath1 electrons @xcite denoted by @xmath78 , which may be related to the ground state energies in the following way : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the ground state energy of the dot populated by @xmath1 electrons . in the continuum limit @xmath81 , i.e. , the experiment actually measures the discrete limit of the inverse compressibility .",
    "the first step in connecting the results obtained from the compressibility calculations to the behavior of @xmath82 is to relate @xmath5 to @xmath3 . with no loss of generality one can write @xmath83 and @xmath84 which if one assumes a well behaved distribution of the compressibility will result in @xmath85 in a similar manner @xmath86 these relations are valid as long as @xmath87 . from eqs .",
    "( [ e9],[e13 ] ) and ( [ f6],[f8 ] ) it can be seen that this condition is usually fulfilled since @xmath43 .",
    "the above condition also holds in the non - interacting metallic regime for which the usual diagrammatic expansion is valid.@xcite thus @xmath88 for short range interactions and @xmath89 for coulomb interactions .",
    "the fluctuations in both cases are equal to @xmath90 from eqs .",
    "( [ h5],[h6 ] ) it is clear that @xmath91 grows proportionally to the interaction strength @xmath92,while the fluctuations are independent of the interaction strength .",
    "this behavior implies that while the e - e interactions tend to shift the distribution of the inverse compressibility the width of the distribution will not change significantly@xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath93 could also be anticipated from a simple assumption on the distribution of the electron density of the ground - state .",
    "the electrostatic energy needed to add an electron to a system of @xmath1 electrons is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the density of the @xmath1 electrons already in the system , and @xmath96 is the density of the additional electron . assuming that both densities are uncorrelated , and that on the average @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the average electrostatic energy needed to add an electron is @xmath99 which for short - range interactions results in @xmath100 and for the coulomb interactions @xmath101 .",
    "since under these assumptions @xmath102 , one immediately obtains eqs .",
    "( [ h5],[h6 ] ) , which is the classical limit of the coulomb blockade.@xcite    also the fluctuations in the inverse compressibility may be deduced from similar assumptions , resulting in @xmath103 for both short and long range interactions .",

    "[ fig.5 ] we present the correlation @xmath160 ( which corresponds to a pair of diagonal sites ) for the long - range interactions as function of the interaction strength . under the rpa assumptions we expect @xmath161 . as can be seen",
    "there is some correlation as result of the boundaries even without e - e interactions .",
    "as the interaction strength increases there is no dramatic change in @xmath160 up to @xmath162 and then one sees a strong deviation .",
    "a similar behavior can be seen for the short range interactions where the deviation appear at @xmath150 .",

    "this is surprisingly close to the values for which deviations from rpa theory are seen numerically .",
    "the main conclusion that follows of the previous sections is that the rpa approximation fails to explain the large fluctuations in the inverse compressibility seen in the experiment @xcite . under",
    "the assumptions of an rpa treatment of the e - e interactions the fluctuations are proportional to the single electron mean level spacing , therefore independent of the strength of the e - e interactions .",
    "in contrast , experiments show that the fluctuations are substantially larger than the mean level spacing , and seem to be about 15 percent of the average inverse compressibility .",
    "actually , one could have anticipated the failure of the rpa calculation for the experimental realizations , since their densities are too low for the rpa approximation to remain valid .",
    "for a 2deg quantum dot one may rewrite the condition for which the rpa fails @xmath166 as @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the electron density in the dot and @xmath169 is the bohr radius , which in gaas is @xmath170 .",
    "thus one expects rpa to fail at densities @xmath171 . in all of the recent experiments for which large fluctuations were observed @xcite the 2deg density is about @xmath172 , and the density in the dot",
    "is probably even lower .",
    "the large fluctuations in the inverse compressibility are caused by spatial fluctuations in the electron density which are not taken into account in the rpa approximation @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that although the charge distribution becomes inhomogeneous when the electron density is still much higher than the one critical for wigner crystallization .",
    "thus the experiments are apparently in an intermediate range of densities ( or intermediate e - e interaction strength ) . in this regime rpa approximation does not hold anymore and some density correlations do appear , however the systems are still very far from the wigner crystallization .    note that in the case of large dimensionless conductance @xmath173 that was considered in this paper we found no influence of the disorder on the structure of coulomb blockade peaks . for different physical reasons fluctuations of the order of the inverse compressibility may also appear in the localized regime.@xcite",
    "finally , it is also interesting to compare the fluctuations in the compressibility to the fluctuations in the polarizability.@xcite although the calculation of both quantities show many similar features , there is one crucial difference .",
    "the main contribution to the fluctuations in the compressibility comes from the zero - mode , which corresponds in the non - interacting case to the single electron level fluctuations . in the polarizability",
    ", there is no contribution from the zero mode , and the fluctuations stem from the other modes , which correspond to density fluctuations .",
