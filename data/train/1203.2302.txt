    "the wave - particle interaction has long been considered a dominant energy - momentum exchange mechanism in space and astrophysical plasmas . beyond the dense and internal boundaries of stars and planetary magnetospheres , space and astrophysical plasmas",

    "these plasmas are also believed to be turbulent systems described by a conventional energy cascade from large scales to small scales where dissipation takes place .",
    "while fluid theories provide satisfactory descriptions of macroscopic quantities at large scales , they are not equipped to explain the plasma physics at smaller kinetic scales , and one needs to include nonlinear kinetic processes ( wave - particle interactions and wave - wave interactions ) for a correct description of these turbulent and collisionless plasmas @xcite .",
    "+ studies of wave - particle interactions in space and astrophysical turbulent plasmas have commonly fallen under the scope of quasi - linear theory @xcite .",
    "quasi - linear theory departs from linear theory in conserving energy and momentum through the account of the wave - particle interaction , resulting in a diffusion process for an ensemble averaged distribution function solution to a fokker - planck equation .",
    "however , quasi - linear theory is constrained by a number of severe limitations making it inapplicable for plasmas containing large - amplitude quasi - monochromatic electromagnetic and/or electrostatic waves .",
    "indeed , the first assumption for quasi - linear theory consists in constraining particle orbits to their unperturbed components .",
    "a second assumption consists in assuming a wave spectrum sufficiently dense so that interference between modes is destroyed by phase - mixing .",
    "hence , quasi - linear theory is valid only when the bandwidth is broad enough to enable resonances to be maintained as particles are scattered , and non - linear trapping effects by individual waves are to weak to be taken into consideration .",
    "+ due to the inherent difficulties of strong turbulence theories , test - particle methods have become a favored tool for the study of wave - particle interaction beyond the constraints of quasi - linear theory .",
    "numerous methods have been developed in the context of the radiation belts alone , ranging from guiding - center approximation @xcite , to resonance - averaged hamiltonian @xcite , gyroresonance averaged equations @xcite and computer simulations taking into account approximate and exact dipolar fields [ see review @xcite and associated references ] .",
    "however , the general case of oblique has often been avoided in favor of the more tractable case of parallel of propagation @xcite .",
    "a strong case can be made for the neglect of oblique propagation and nonlinear effects for small amplitude waves since the appearance of a small parallel electric field can not trap orbits @xcite .",
    "however , if the electric field component of the wave becomes sufficiently large , such that nonlinear effects can be triggered , then a rich class of orbits can result , and the parallel approximation becomes invalid .",
    "+ recent observations of the weakly collisional plasma of the radiation belts are suggesting that obliquely propagating waves with poynting flux two orders of magnitude larger than previously observed whistlers waves are commonly generated in the radiation belts and appear correlated with relativistic electron microbursts @xcite .",
    "these large amplitude waves can propagate at large propagation angles ( @xmath5 ) , and possess amplitudes capable of energizing electrons on time scales of the order of the milliseconds @xcite . if these large - amplitudes waves are shown to be a common observational signature in the radiation belts , the conventional models used to describe the wave - particle interaction using a quasi - linear formalism will have to be revisited .",
    "it is not only inaccurate to assume that a particle will execute a random walk in pitch angle during the course of one bounce period , but as demonstrated below , a particle can be irreversibly accelerated to relativistic energies in less than one bounce period .",
    "+ in this report , we investigate the exact nonlinear wave - particle interaction in the relativistic regime . the inclusion of relativistic effects is a _ sine qua non _ condition for any attempt at solving the outstanding problems which have emerged in radiation belts dynamics as well as galactic cosmic ray .",
    "our goal is to provide a general framework for the wave - particle interaction by using a dynamical systems approach .",
    "such approach , although lacking the level of self - consistency found in numerical simulations , can facilitate the understanding of complex systems such as cosmic and space plasmas and therefore provide for an intuitive as well as quantitative leap between theoretical models and simulations .",
    "+ the report is written as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the dynamical system as well as its fixed points and invariants . in section 3",
    "we treat the special cases of parallel and purely perpendicular propagation . in section 4",
    "we study the general case of oblique propagation for the cyclotron - resonance case as well as the landau resonance .",
    "section 5 contains a discussion of the general framework for the understanding of the wave - particle interaction and the effect of oblique propagation in collisionless plasmas such as the radiation belts . in section 6",
    "we conclude and discuss studies currently underway to address limitations of the dynamical system approach .",
    "our study begins with the equation of motion of a particle in an electromagnetic field , as described by the lorentz equation .",
    "the equations of motion can be written as @xmath6},\\ ] ] for a particle of charge @xmath7 , momentum @xmath8 and rest mass @xmath9 .",
    "the lorentz factor , @xmath3 , is defined in terms of the relativistic momentum as follows : @xmath10 the electromagnetic field configuration consists of a background magnetic field @xmath11 to which is superposed an electromagnetic wave given by @xmath12 : @xmath13 @xmath14 the electromagnetic wave vector @xmath15 is chosen to point in the @xmath16 direction , obliquely to the background magnetic field lying in the y - z plane : @xmath17 @xmath18 with the wave magnetic field components written as @xmath19 and faraday s law , expressed in terms of the fourier components , providing for the components of the electric field@xmath20 we can therefore express the dynamical system in terms of the phase velocity @xmath21 , and the variables @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ; @xmath24 , resulting in the following coupled ordinary differential equations : @xmath25 in the classical case , the dynamical system is composed of four equations , the three components of the velocity plus the position coordinate along @xmath26 . however , in the relativistic case the expression for the lorentz factor must be obeyed and constitutes a constraint on the particle s trajectory .",
    "we can keep track of this constraint by adding an equation in the expression of a dynamical gyrofrequency : @xmath27 if we define the constant @xmath28 , it is straightforward to see that @xmath29 , and similarly , since @xmath30 , the time evolution of this quantity can be written as : @xmath31 in order to simplify the dynamical system , we can eliminate the explicit time dependence of the equations by making the following mathematical transformation : @xmath32 for the lorentz factor : @xmath33 we can therefore write the equations of motion as follow : @xmath34 if we absorb the lorentz factor @xmath35 into @xmath36 and @xmath26 , that is we write @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and write @xmath39 in terms of @xmath40 , we can express the dynamical system as : @xmath41 where the refractive index is represented as @xmath42 .",
    "the magnitude of the momentum is now written as @xmath43 , hence the lorentz contraction factor also transforms from @xmath44 .",
    "the dynamical system for the classical case can be recovered by setting @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , the equations are equivalent to the classical case under the following transformations : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "hence the main difference lies in the time dependence of the larmor frequencies and the extra term that goes as @xmath49 in the @xmath50 equation .",
    "it is convenient to express the relativistic momentum in spherical coordinates , that is in terms of a magnitude @xmath55 and phase angles @xmath56 .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing the following scalar and vector variables : @xmath57 where @xmath58 . using these definitions",
    ", we can rewrite the momentum @xmath59 in terms of the pitch angle @xmath52 and the dynamical gyrophase @xmath53 , both defined as    @xmath60    hence , all three momentum components in the wave frame are written as : @xmath61 using the definitions ( [ eq : tan_alpha ] ) and the representation of the momentum in ( [ eq : spherical ] ) , we can proceed to write the dynamical system ( [ eq : ds_in_ps ] ) in terms of the normalized variables : @xmath62 and the function @xmath63 , as follow : @xmath64 it is easy to observe that we can recover the classical regime by setting @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "we now proceed to study some of the properties of the dynamical system .",
    "a common first step in the study of dynamical systems is to find and investigate the properties of fixed ( stationary ) points .",
    "the fixed points of the dynamical system ( [ eq : ds ] ) are defined as the values in @xmath67 , for which @xmath68 .",
    "it can be demonstrated ( see appendix 1 ) that the dynamical system , for @xmath69 , possesses the following values for the fixed points : @xmath70 it is already evident from ( [ eq : fp77 ] ) that in the case of parallel propagation ( @xmath0 ) , the only fixed point is that for the trivial case @xmath71 .",
    "the fixed point for the relativistic regime appears therefore similar to the classical one for parallel and oblique propagation @xcite .",
    "the fixed point for the relativistic regime will translate into properties found in the non - relativistic regime , but also results in different types of structures in their vicinity . for non - zero propagation angles ,",
    "fixed points identify volumes of phase - space composed of physically trapped orbits .",
    "the trapped orbits could give rise to kinetic distortions in the distribution functions , such as beams and temperature anisotropies , as was revealed in the classical non - relativistic case @xcite .",
    "however , because the relativistic equations possess a constraint in the form of the lorentz factor @xmath3 , different effects are shown to arise .      the dynamical system ( [ eq : ds ] ) also possesses a number of invariants valid for the general case of oblique propagation .",
    "knowledge of these invariants is used to construct pseudo - potential structures . in turn , these structures provide information on trapped and quasi - trapped orbits .      using equations ( [ eq : norm ] ) to normalize equation ( [ eq : omega_dot ] )",
    ", the equation describing the evolution of the gyrofrequency can be written as follow : @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "hence , this equation has an exact solution , providing the following constant of the motion : @xmath75 we can write this invariant in terms of the variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 as follow : @xmath78 the conservation of this quantity will indicate the degree to which the constraint for the lorentz factor ( [ eq : constraint ] ) is respected in a numerical scheme .      a second general invariant can be found and expressed in terms of the normalized variables as follow : @xmath80 this invariant underlies a fundamental property of oblique propagation .",
    "one can indeed rewrite the invariant in the form @xmath81 , which means that one needs a change in the parallel momentum to change the energy .",
    "this is a well - known statement resulting from the maxwell - lorentz invariant quantity @xmath82 , since a parallel component of the electric field can not be eliminated by any lorentz translation , while the physics in a frame with @xmath83 , such as in the case of parallel propagation , is no different , therefore , than the physics in a frame where @xmath84 for which energy is a constant of the motion .",
    "the wave - particle interaction problem has overwhelmingly been treated for the special case of parallel propagation .",
    "even though we do not present any new result in this section , we find it useful to briefly discuss the parallel case as a means of comparison to the general oblique case .",
    "setting @xmath0 in ( [ eq : ds ] ) , we recover the following dynamical system :    @xmath85    in addition to the two invariants @xmath72 and @xmath79 , equations ( [ eq : ds_0 ] ) also possesses the following constant of motion for @xmath86 : @xmath87 + moreover , the existence of physically trapped orbits for @xmath0 requires that @xmath88 , hence , @xmath89 .",
    "however , this conditions results in @xmath90 .",
    "aside from the trivial case of @xmath71 , no fixed point exists and the parallel propagation has the particular distinction , with respect to oblique propagation , to not possess solutions for which a particle could be trapped in @xmath91 .",
    "+ the parallel case has been studied in both the classical and relativistic regime . the classical treatment covered by _ _",

    "roberts and buchsbaum _ @xcite",
    "have also treated the relativistic case with a special focus on the case @xmath92 , for which a cyclotron - resonant particle was shown to gain energy indefinitely , while for @xmath86 , the particle simply becomes phase trapped at cyclotron - resonance with no net gain in energy on average . using the invariant in equation ( [ eq : parallel_invariant ] ) as well as @xmath72 and @xmath79 ,",
    "those results can be expressed in terms of a pseudo - potential equation in the parallel component of the momentum that we write as @xmath93 : @xmath94}^2\\bigg{[}\\frac{n^2 - 1}{\\sigma(y)^2}-2\\frac{y}{\\sigma(y)}-\\bigg{(}y^2+n^2\\delta_2\\bigg{)}\\bigg{]}-\\frac{1}{8}\\sigma(y)^2\\bigg{(}y-1\\bigg{)}^4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the function @xmath95 .",
    "solutions to equation ( [ eq : potential_parallel ] ) for @xmath96 are bound states of the system for as far as parallel momentum is concerned .",
    "however , this only holds for @xmath86 . in the case of @xmath92",
    ", we can easily recover the unlimited acceleration found by _ _ roberts and buchsbaum__@xcite from the invariants of the motion . setting @xmath0 and @xmath92 for @xmath79",
    ", one finds that @xmath97 is constant .",
    "that is , if a particle is at cyclotron - resonance , it will remain so forever ( or until the wave damps ) , and gain energy indefinitely .",
    "it is demonstrated in the remainder of the report , that unlimited acceleration is also possible for oblique propagation and that it underlies a specific property of the fixed points .",
    "+      we now investigate the purely perpendicular case , as its treatment will be useful to characterize the dynamics for propagation angles that increase towards @xmath98 .",
    "the dynamical system is written in the following form : @xmath99    similarly to the parallel case , the dynamical system ( [ eq : ds_90 ] ) possesses its own set of invariants written as : @xmath100 with the fixed point analysis for this particular case showing that no fixed points exists , i.e. , a particle can not be physically trapped , we make the assumption that the solution for @xmath91 takes the form of a linear relationship in time : @xmath101 , with @xmath102 as the initial condition and @xmath103 as a constant . replacing the solution for @xmath91 in the invariant @xmath104 results in the following expression : @xmath105 it is therefore evident that for @xmath106 to be true , the term @xmath107 must be either zero , or compensated by the momentum in @xmath108 , @xmath109 , to grow to minus infinity as @xmath110 goes to infinity . in the absence of accessible landau and cyclotron resonances , the latter solution does not appear acceptable",
    ". we can qualitatively demonstrate this assumption by noting that for @xmath111 , the following approximation must be respected : @xmath112 .",
    "hence , either a ) @xmath113 , or b ) @xmath114.in the first case , if @xmath113 , then @xmath115 as well .",
    "hence for @xmath116 to be constant , stationary solutions giving @xmath117 are required .",
    "such solutions would necessitate @xmath118 .",
    "such constraint means that either @xmath119 or @xmath120 . but both solutions are unacceptable since they would imply the existence of a fixed point , which has been demonstrated to not exist for the special case of perpendicular propagation . in the second case , the requirement",
    "that @xmath114 means that since @xmath121 is bounded , @xmath122 , which is in contradiction with the evidence that @xmath91 must be linear in time because of a zero parallel electric field .",
    "we are therefore left with the assumption that @xmath123 , an assumption that can indeed be verified by numerical integration .",
    "+ without any loss of generality , we set @xmath124 , resulting in the solution @xmath125 . using @xmath116",
    "we find the following solutions for @xmath97 : @xmath126 similarly , the solution for @xmath127 can be directly found from @xmath104 : @xmath128 using those two solutions we can find the exact differential for @xmath77 : @xmath129d\\tau.\\ ] ] hence , the following solutions for @xmath77 : @xmath130}.\\ ] ] we can finally find the exact solution for the last variable in terms of @xmath110 from the dynamical system equation in @xmath91 , that is : @xmath131}.\\ ] ] we have therefore derived exact solutions for the perpendicular case , based on the existence of two invariants and the nonexistence of fixed points .",
    "two limiting cases can be deduced from these solutions .",
    "if the wave is sustained for long periods , such that the time of interaction with the particles @xmath132 for @xmath133 , the perpendicular propagation results in phase trapped orbits with no net gain of energy on average . in the opposite case where the interaction would be short - lived such that @xmath134 , we can calculate the average increment in energy during the time of interaction . if we write ( [ eq : gamma_90 ] ) in terms of @xmath135 , and assume large amplitude , low - frequency waves such that @xmath136 , then @xmath137 and a particle gains energy of the order of @xmath138 for every interaction .",
    "given a prescription in the probability of interaction @xmath139 with an electromagnetic wave of phase - speed @xmath140 , one could build a map to describe the nonlinear interaction of a particle in a relativistic turbulent plasma composed of highly oblique electromagnetic waves .",

    "the most commonly studied problems of wave - particle interactions have been addressed in the context of cyclotron - resonance .",

    "a general framework for understanding the wave - particle interaction for a monochromatic wave can be drawn from the previous theoretical analysis of the dynamical system presented in this paper . when the propagation is parallel , that is @xmath0 , the electric field can be eliminated by making a transformation to the wave - frame , resulting in the particle",
    "s dynamics being resolved entirely .",
    "the particle can be phase - trapped but never physically trapped .",
    "when the propagation angle increases , the obliquity becomes manifest through the appearance of a lorentz - invariant parallel electric field .",
    "this electric field physically traps orbits and can result in the creation of a beam parallel to the background magnetic field as well as anisotropies in temperature .",
    "indeed , the oblique propagation can provide an explanation for kinetic distortions of distribution functions for relativistic energies , in a similar manner that it does for the classical case .",
    "as the propagation angle increases , the stable fixed point ( @xmath195 ) , responsible for trapped orbits and kinetic distortions of distribution functions , goes as @xmath199 and therefore shifts trapped cells to higher parallel velocities . if the stable fixed point is too distant from the tail of the distribution , no particles will be trapped . this transition from physically trapped to untrapped orbits",
    "is singularized by the treatment of the purely perpendicular case . for @xmath1 , as well as for particles that do not belong to the basin of the stable fixed point for @xmath200 ,",
    "the dynamics of the orbit can be simplified to a back and forth slushing on the wave with no net gain in energy on average .",
    "+ on the other hand , if the propagation angle reaches the critical value @xmath196 , at which the stability of the fixed point is destroyed by the hopf bifurcation , the particle belonging to the basin of attraction will be accelerated uniformly to relativistic energies . for @xmath197 ,",
    "a particle initially belonging to the basin of attraction now becomes chaotic and physical trapping is lost .",
    "+ in - between the regions of phase - space composed of physically trapped and surfing orbits , resides one further source of particle energization .",
    "the acceleration in this case originates in the cyclotron - resonance and results in stochastic trajectories .",
    "the inclusion of obliquity as well as the preservation of nonlinearities and relativistic effects , reveal that for a given propagation angle , there is a window in parameter space for which a particle can be accelerated in a diffusive manner primarily along the perpendicular direction .",
    "this stochastic process is similar to that of the overlapping resonances for the classical case for obliquely propagating electrostatic waves @xcite .",
    "the results described in the section above consist indeed of an overlapping of resonances , but does operate for wave - amplitudes about two orders of magnitude lower than those previously assumed .",
    "the explanation for this discrepancy with the classical regime is that as the particle gains energy , the dynamical gyrofrequency @xmath201 decreases sufficiently to allow the particle to wander from one resonance to another .",
    "+ the acceleration mechanisms described above both have the important and interesting particularity to operate on short kinetic time scales .",
    "the difference is that one operates stochastically and energizes particles primarily along the perpendicular direction , while the second results in a locking in pitch angle and gyrophase , and accelerates particles coherently and primarily along the parallel direction .",
    "+      the most recent waveforms measured in the radiation belts have revealed an unexpected discovery .",
    "large - amplitudes , monochromatic , obliquely propagating , and bursty waveforms were not only repeatedly measured in the radiation belts @xcite , but appeared correlated with electron energization@xcite as well as relativistic microbursts events @xcite .",
    "the correlation between chorus waves and electron energization in the radiation belts is not recent , but it is suspected that if such waveforms were more commonly present in the radiation belts that they could be the dominant trigger responsible for the energization of electrons on short time - scales .",
    "a study by yoon@xcite has shown that if one solves the plasma equations self - consistently , that such waveforms were indeed capable to accelerate electrons on kinetic time scales consistently with the observations .",
    "even though our study lacks the levels of self - consistency provided by the numerical method developed by yoon@xcite , we arrive to similar conclusions if we choose parameters consistent with the radiation belts measured waveforms .",
    "if we integrate the dynamical system for a few wave - periods , and with low - frequency @xmath202 , large amplitude @xmath203 and for propagation angles obeying the hopf bifurcations , we find that kev electrons commonly found in the radiation belts could be accelerated on the order of the milliseconds to mev energies .",
    "+ however , despite encouraging results , we would like to leave a few words of caution .",
    "we can not rule that such a mechanism is at play in the radiation belts and the reasons are as follows .",
    "1 ) there is no clear understanding of the origin of the observed large - amplitude oblique waveforms in the radiation belts . before we can pinpoint their origin ,",
    "it is impossible to attempt any self - consistent approach to the current problem .",
    "2 ) the observations of these waveforms are plagued by uncertainties large enough to seriously undermine any attempt to determine precisely one or multiple acceleration processes . in the very case of the surfatron at landau resonance , one would need good resolution for the electric and magnetic field components of the waves to obtain propagation angles and wave vectors .",
    "3 ) finally , the wave forms are observed with an electrostatic component and the analysis above needs to be conducted with the addition of this compressive electric component . even though it can be shown that the addition of the electrostatic field with the same phase as the electromagnetic components of the fields would result in the same condition for the surfatron process , a difference in phase would shift the hopf bifurcation and have non - trivial effects that needs to be scrutinized . + in such context",
    ", we can not claim that such a mechanism is at play in the radiation belts , but we do suggest that since electrons with kev energies can be accelerated to mev energies on kinetic timescales , that such mechanism could possibly arise in the radiation belts and other space and cosmic plasmas who are suspected to be permeated by equivalent large - amplitude waveforms .",
    "we have developed a dynamical system to model the interaction of an ion with an obliquely propagating electromagnetic wave in the relativistic limit . we have given a particular focus on the effect of the obliquity on the particle dynamics .",
    "it was demonstrated that physical trapping of landau resonant particles could be identified by the fixed points analysis .",
    "perhaps the main conclusion of our study is that the wave - particle interaction of a single wave demonstrates a rich diversity of mechanisms ( acceleration , surfing , stochasticity , trapping ) for which the propagation angle is an important and critical parameter .",
    "indeed , the most telling observation , is that the physics at one propagation angle @xmath4 can be significantly altered for an angle @xmath204 . +",
    "even though the prime difference between oblique propagations with parallel and perpendicular propagations , resides in the inclusion of a region of phase - space for which particles are physically trapped , we have shown that the relativistic treatment also translates in coupled values in @xmath205 for which particles are accelerated to relativistic energies on kinetic time - scales @xmath206 .",
    "such a mechanism , even though requiring specific wave - properties , can be efficient since it operates on short - time scales , and the volume encompassed by the attractor is large enough to affect a non - negligible portion of a distribution function .",
    "+ furthermore , it was shown that relativistic effects enhance the cyclotron - resonant stochastic acceleration . as a result of the overlapping in resonances",
    ", particles can wander through multiple resonances resulting in a stochastic increase in energy .",
    "this relativistic effect is of interest , since it provides acceleration for wave - amplitudes lower than those required for classical regimes of overlapping cyclotron - resonance .",
    "such mechanism could pertain and be more spread than initially assumed in weakly collisional plasmas where particles can be confined for long - time scales .",
    "+ it should finally be pointed out that the model we used is not self - consistent , and will therefore require corrections in order to take into account the complexity of space and astrophysical plasmas . among these necessary corrections ,",
    "the departure from a monochromatic spectrum to one composed of a bandwidth , appears today as the most fundamental of them all .",
    "even though some of the large - amplitude waves recently measured in the radiation belt show a significant degree of monochromaticity , the cosmic and space plasmas are mostly turbulent , and the inclusion of additional waves to confirm or infirm the nature of the processes responsible for the acceleration of particles is an inevitable step .",
    "however , the dynamical system approach offers numerous advantages and the endeavors for greater self - consistency can be achieved accordingly .",
    "indeed , the dynamical system for the general case , once families of solutions have been found , can be used as a background nonlinear solution to the wave - particle interaction , upon which corrections , such as addition of waves , changing polarization , dispersion effects , inhomogeneous background magnetic field , etc .",
    ", can all be treated as perturbations to the family of solutions of the `` nonlinear homogeneous '' system .",
    "such method could be investigated theoretically and numerically , in the similar methodological fashion and with comparable tools that hamiltonian systems were constructed to investigate the impact of nonlinear perturbations .",
