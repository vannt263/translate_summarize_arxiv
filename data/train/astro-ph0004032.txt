    "there are two independent determinations of the oxygen abundance in the same object or independent determinations in different parts of the hii region .",
    "since the goal of the present study is a search for the line intensities  oxygen abundance relation but not an investigation of the chemical properties of individual galaxies , the independent determinations of oxygen abundance in the same object were included in the list as individual data points .",
    "our data confirm the conclusion of kennicutt et al ( 2000 ) that the edmunds and pagel calibration ( edmunds & pagel 1984 ) provides a more robust diagnostic of oxygen abundance , but an inspection of the fig.[figure:9664f1 ] shows that it still results in an oxygen abundance that is higher than the mean at any given log@xmath4 .",

    "the fact that the slope of the best fit differs from 1 has far - reaching implications : it means that value of @xmath15 varies systematically with @xmath2 and a quantity other than @xmath15 should be used in oxygen abundance determination . in order to verify the reality of this fact and to clearly recognize the consequences , the subset of selected hii regions with best determined oxygen abundances through the @xmath5  method has been considered",
    "this subset includes the low - metallicity ( 12+logo / h @xmath16 7.95 ) hii regions from izotov & thuan ( 1998 , 1999 ) and izotov & thuan , and lipovetsky ( 1994 , 1997 ) .",

    "the origin of this systematic error is as follows . in a general case",
    "the intensities of oxygen emission lines in spectra of hii regions depend not only on the oxygen abundance but also on the physical conditions ( hardness of the ionizing radiation and geometrical factor ) .",

    "therefore , the oxygen abundances derived with the @xmath5  method and with the p ",

    "the fact that the value of @xmath15 in hii regions with a given oxygen abundance varies systematically with @xmath2 can be directly established from detailed consideration of the @xmath7 versus o / h diagram , fig.[figure:9664f7 ] .",

    "inspection of fig.[figure:9664f7 ] shows that the hii regions with different values of @xmath2 lie along different straight lines shifted relative to each other depending on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "according to the model grid of mcgaugh ( 1991 ) this shifting is accounted for by the variations in the geometrical factors .",
    "the general best fit o / h  x@xmath8 ( equation ( 3 ) ) is very close to the best fit to the data for hii regions with 0.05 @xmath43 @xmath2 @xmath43 0.1 , fig.[figure:9664f7 ] .",

    "conversely , the hii regions with @xmath2 @xmath16 0.10 are shifted to the left from the general best fit in fig.[figure:9664f7 ] , and so the @xmath37 derived for them from equation ( 3 ) are lower than @xmath40 , fig.[figure:9664f6 ] .    thus , the above discussion of the subset of selected hii regions with best determined oxygen abundances through the @xmath5  method suggests that _",

    "hence , the extrapolated intersect @xmath9 seems to be more reliable than the extrapolated intersect @xmath10 and the values of x@xmath19 are more suitable for the oxygen abundance determination in the oxygen - rich hii regions .",
    "the dispersions in x@xmath19 and x@xmath17 values for a given oxygen abundance are significantly larger for oxygen - rich than for oxygen - poor hii regions .    for hii regions with 12+log@xmath40 @xmath43 8.15 the relations between o / h and x@xmath8 and between o / h and x@xmath19 have been again approximated by linear relationships .",

    "however in the case of oxygen - rich hii regions the systematic errors are masked by large random errors .",
    "there is no systematic error in the oxygen abundances derived with the p  method .",
    "thus , the determinations of oxygen abundances with the correction of @xmath4 for excitation effects result in oxygen abundances which are in better agreement with oxygen abundances derived through the @xmath5  method both in low- and in high - metallicity hii regions .",

    "there is no one - to - one correspondance between @xmath7 value and oxygen abundance derived with the p  method .",
    "inspection of fig.[figure:9664f9 ] shows that the differences between oxygen abundances derived with the p  method and with the @xmath4  method are systematically changed with @xmath3 from around 0.1 dex for hii regions with @xmath3 @xmath42 0.1 to around + 0.2 dex for hii regions with @xmath3 @xmath42 1 . in the general case , two hii regions ( with @xmath3 @xmath42 0.1 and with @xmath3 @xmath42 1 )",

    "it is easy to understand that the proximity of @xmath37 and @xmath48 for hii regions with @xmath3 in the range from @xmath42 0.7 to @xmath42 0.2 is caused by the fact that the hii regions with @xmath3 values from this range lie close to the derived o / h  x@xmath8 relation ( see discussion for low - metallicity hii regions and fig.[figure:9664f7 ] ) .    the exactness of oxygen abundance determination with the suggested p ",

    "method is comparable with the exactness provided by the @xmath5  method .",
    "the estimation of an exactness of the oxygen abundance determination with the p  method in the case of the oxygen - rich hii regions ( upper branch ) is more problematic since few high - quality oxygen abundance determinations with the @xmath5  method are available .",
    "the mean value of @xmath49 ( by absolute value ) for oxygen - rich hii regions is 0.14 , and for an individual hii region this difference can be as large as around 0.25 , fig.[figure:9664f9 ] . in the limiting case , when it is assumed that the oxygen abundances derived with the @xmath5  method are precise , the values of @xmath49 are totally accounted for by the inexactness of the p  method .",

    ". inspection of fig.[figure:9664f11 ] shows that the oxygen abundances derived with the p  method correlates even more tightly with the galactocentric distance than the oxygen abundances derived with the @xmath5  method . since the level of excitation in hii regions of ngc2403 is not very high ( @xmath2 is less than -0.2 for any hii region ) the @xmath4  method ( present calibration ) results in the oxygen abundances which are close to that derived with the p  method .",
    "the oxygen abundances determined with calibration of edmunds and pagel are slightly higher than that obtained with present calibration , in agreement with above conclusion that the @xmath4  o / h calibration of edmunds and pagel is shifted towards higher oxygen abundances by around 0.07 dex .",

    "are less reliable . for the majority of hii regions in the present compilation the differences between oxygen abundances derived with the p  method and with the @xmath4  method are appreciably less than between those derived with the @xmath4  method ( or the p  method ) and those from the @xmath5  method . in the general case",
    ", however , two hii regions can have the same @xmath37 while their @xmath48 can differ by @xmath42 0.3 dex .",
    "the calibration of @xmath4 presented here is compared to previous calibrations .",
    "the calibration of edmunds and pagel ( 1984 ) has the same slope but is shifted towards higher oxygen abundances by about 0.07 dex as compared to the present calibration .",
    "other previous calibrations ( mccall & rybski and shields 1985 , dopita & evans 1986 , zaritsky et al 1994 ) are shifted towards still higher abundances .    for the high - metallicity hii regions",
    "the exactness of oxygen abundance determination with the suggested p  method can not be firmly estimated due to the lack of the high - quality determinations of oxygen abundances with the @xmath5  method .",
    "indirect arguments suggest that the p  method provides as accurate oxygen abundances in oxygen - rich hii regions as the @xmath5  method taking into account the present - day state - of - art with the line intensity measurements .",
