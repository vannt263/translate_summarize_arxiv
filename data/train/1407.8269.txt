    "aggregation of preferences is a central problem in the field of social choice , and has received a considerable amount of attention from the artificial intelligence research community . while the most - studied scenario is that of selecting a single candidate out of many , it is often the case that one needs to select a fixed - size _ set of winners ( committee ) _ :",
    "this includes domains such as parliamentary elections , the hiring of faculty members , or ( automated ) agents deciding on a set of plans  @xcite .",
    "the study of algorithmic complexity of voting rules that output committees is an active research direction .",
    "much of the prior work on properties of multi - winner rules focuses on the setting where voters preferences are total orders of the candidates .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we focus on approval - based rules , where each voter lists the subset of candidates that she approves of .",
    "one of the advantages of such rules is the simplicity of ballots : approval ballots reduce the cognitive burden on voters ( rather than providing a full ranking of the candidates , a voter only needs to decide which candidates to approve ) and are also easier to communicate to the election authority .",
    "the most straightforward way to aggregate approvals is to have every approval for a candidate contribute one point to that candidate s score and select the candidates with the highest score .",
    "this rule is called _ approval voting ( @xmath5)_. @xmath5has many desirable properties in the single winner case  @xcite , including its `` simplicity , propensity to elect condorcet winners ( when they exist ) , its robustness to manipulation and its monotonicity '' @xcite . however , for the case of multiple winners , the merits of @xmath6 are `` less clear '' @xcite . in particular , for the multi - winner case , @xmath5does not address concerns such as proportional representation : if the goal is to select @xmath7 winners , @xmath8 of the agents approve the same @xmath7 candidates , and the remaining agents approve a disjoint set of @xmath7 candidates , then the agents in minority do not get any of their approved candidates selected .    as a consequence , over the years , several multi - winner rules based on approval ballots have been proposed . under _ proportional approval voting ( @xmath1 ) _ , each agent s contribution to the committee s total score depends on how many candidates from the agent s approval set have been elected .",
    "a sequential variant of this rule is known as _ reweighted approval voting ( @xmath2)_. another way to modulate the approvals is through computing a satisfaction score for each agent based on the ratio of the number of their approved candidates appearing in the committee and their total number of approved candidates ; this idea leads to _ satisfaction approval voting ( @xmath9)_. one could also use a distance - based approach : _ minimax approval voting ( @xmath3 ) _ selects a set of @xmath7 candidates that minimizes the maximum hamming distance from the submitted ballots .",
    "all the rules informally described above have a more egalitarian objective than @xmath5 .",
    "for example , steven brams , the main proponent of @xmath5 in single - winner elections , has argued that @xmath9is more suitable for more equitable representation in multi - winner elections  @xcite .",
    "based on their relative merits , approval - based multi - winner rules have been examined in great detail in both economics and computer science literature in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the handbook of approval voting discusses various approval - based multi - winner rules including @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath9and @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "however , there has been limited axiomatic analysis of these rules from the perspective of representation .    in this paper , we introduce and investigate the notion of _ justified representation _ ( @xmath0 ) in approval - based voting .",
    "briefly , a committee is said to provide justified representation for a given set of ballots if every large enough group of voters with shared preferences is allocated at least one representative .",
    "a rule is said to satisfy justified representation if it always outputs a committee that provides justified representation .",
    "this concept is related to the _ droop proportionality criterion _ @xcite and dummett s _ solid coalition property _  @xcite , but is specific to approval - based elections . a somewhat similar notion of _ representativeness",
    "_ was recenty proposed by ; however , justified representation does not imply representativeness and , conversely , representativeness does not imply justified representation .",
    "we show that every set of ballots admits a committee that provides justified representation ; moreover , such a committee can be computed efficiently , and checking whether a given committee provides @xmath0can be done in polynomial time as well .",
    "this shows that justified representation is a reasonable requirement .",
    "however , it turns out that very few of the existing multi - winner approval - based rules satisfy it .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate that @xmath5 , @xmath9 , @xmath3and the standard variant of @xmath2do not satisfy @xmath0 . on the positive side ,",
    "@xmath0is satisfied by @xmath1and some of its variants , as well as an extreme variant of @xmath2 .",
    "also , @xmath3satisfies @xmath0 for a restricted type of voters preferences .",
    "we then consider a strengthening of the @xmath0axiom , which we call _ extended justified representation ( @xmath4)_. this axiom captures the intuition that a very large group of voters with similar preferences may deserve not just one , but several representatives .",
    "@xmath4turns out to be a more demanding property than @xmath0 : of all voting rules considered in this paper , only @xmath1satisfies @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , it is computationally hard to check whether a given committee provides @xmath4 .",
    "we also consider another strengthening of @xmath0 , which we call _ strong justified representation ( @xmath10 ) _ ; however , it turns out that for some inputs @xmath10is impossible to achieve .",
    "we conclude the paper by showing how @xmath0can be used to formulate other attractive approval - based multi - winner rules , and by identifying several directions for future work .",
    "we consider a social choice setting with a set of agents ( voters ) @xmath11 and a set of candidates @xmath12 .",
    "each agent @xmath13 submits an approval ballot @xmath14 , which represents the subset of candidates that she approves of .",
    "we refer to the list @xmath15 of approval ballots as the _ ballot profile_. we will consider _ approval - based multi - winner voting rules _ that take as input @xmath16 , where @xmath7 is a positive integer that satisfies @xmath17 , and return a subset @xmath18 of size @xmath7 , which we call the _ winning set _ , or _ committee",
