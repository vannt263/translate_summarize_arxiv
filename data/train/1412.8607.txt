    "the black hole perturbation method is important to investigate the physical property of black holes , such as the quasinormal modes , and the various astrophysical phenomenon like the orbital evolution of stars around much larger black holes and the the gravitational waves induced by them .",
    "especially the later phenomenon include the extreme mass ratio inspirals which are one of the most important sources for the future space laser interferometers , elisa @xcite , decigo @xcite , and bbo @xcite .",
    "when the black holes are non - rotating , the metric perturbation can be analyzed by using the regge - wheeler and the zerilli equations @xcite , which are the single , decoupled equations for the odd and even parity modes , respectively . on the other hand , if the black holes are rotating , there is no such formalism .",
    "the perturbation of kerr black holes are usually analyzed by using the teukolsky equation which is the equation for the perturbation of the weyl scalars , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "there is a formalism , by chrzanowski @xcite and cohen and kegeles @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) , to compute the metric perturbation from the perturbation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 obtained with the teukolsky equation ( hereafter , this is called the cck formalism ) . in this method ,",
    "a radiation gauge is used to calculate the metric perturbation .",
    "recently , this method becomes more important , mainly because of the necessity to compute the gravitational self - force on the point particle orbiting around a kerr black hole , and several works have been done @xcite .    in spite of these developments , there are still only a few examples of the explicit computation of the metric perturbation by using the cck formalism . in our previous paper @xcite ( hereafter , paper i ) , we computed the metric perturbation induced by a rotating circular mass ring on the equatorial plane around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we found that if we consider only modes which can be derived from @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( which contain harmonic modes of @xmath2 ) , there appear unphysical discontinuities in the hertz potential and the metric perturbation at the ring radius .",
    "this discontinuities , however , can be removed by adding the lower modes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and by setting free parameters , corresponding to the gauge freedom , appropriately .",
    "we obtained metric perturbation which is regular everywhere except for the equatorial plane outside the ring radius .    in this paper",
    ", we extend this analysis to the case of the kerr black hole . as in the schwarzschild case ,",
    "this problem is stationary and axisymmetric .",
    "nevertheless , this problem contains both the mass and the angular momentum perturbation .",
