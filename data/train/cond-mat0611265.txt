    "recently an important concept for the analysis of systems driven out of thermal equilibrium , namely that of _ large deviations _ in the associated probability distributions , has again found considerable attention , both at the experimental and theoretical level .",
    "mathematically , large deviation functions have been defined and introduced long ago , but only in the early seventies were they shown to play a central role in characterising the properties of non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) measures , see @xcite for a review . for some time this idea remained",
    "mostly confined within the mathematical community until it was exploited in physics at the theoretical level by evans , cohen , and morriss who showed numerically that the temporal large deviation function of a certain observable , namely the shear stress , in the ness of viscous gases under shear displayed a surprisingly simple symmetry property @xcite .",
    "this symmetry property , now known as the _ fluctuation relation _ , was then formalised into a theorem by gallavotti and cohen @xcite . over the past years , a remarkable amount of research has been devoted to the investigation of the fluctuation relation in detail , with the goal to explicitly determine the large deviation function at the core of the theorem s formulation @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasised that at about the same period , experimentalists also started to employ , as a tool for analysing their data , the concept of large deviations @xcite .",
    "their initial interest was grounded in the belief that , much in the same way as the intensive free energy per degree of freedom constitutes a central quantity if one wishes to relate two systems in thermal equilibrium , large deviation functions might similarly allow for a comparison of ness _ dynamical _ properties , yet be applicable to systems both in and out of equilibrium .",
    "indeed , it has been a highly desirable , but as yet largely elusive goal of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics to be able to classify dynamical systems ( at least in a steady state ) according to a restricted number of ( macro- or mesoscopic ) criteria . in particular , it was expected that large deviation functions of observables such as energy flow , particle current ( or more generally entropy flow ) would display a sufficient degree of universality to render this approach fruitful ( see refs . @xcite through @xcite ) .    on the theoretical side , a series of recent results however lends support to such aspirations . by studying systems of interacting and diffusing particles governed by some markovian dynamics ,",
    "subjected to an external chemical potential gradient , bodineau and derrida @xcite , as well as bertini , de  sole , gabrielli , jona - lasinio , and landim @xcite , found a general strategy to completely determine the large deviation of the particle current flowing through the system .",
    "note , however , that in this setting the applied field ( and the related particle current ) become vanishingly small as the system size is increased .",
    "then the only two ingredients entering the final expression for the large deviation function are the diffusion constant and the equilibrium compressibility , which is an astonishingly simple result : the large deviations of the current are fully characterised by properties of the system at equilibrium or in the linear response regime .",
    "there are two restrictions , however , that apply to this series of recent advances .",
    "namely , first they all concern systems exhibiting _ normal _ diffusive dynamics . in physical terms",
    ", this means that the continuum limit can be taken by scaling time according to @xmath0 proportional to a microscopic length scale @xmath1 squared ( often referred to as the hydrodynamic limit ) .",
    "there are of course numerous situations in nature where diffusion becomes _ anomalous _ , which means that the time and length scales appropriate for taking the continuum limit are related by @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate the particle current large deviation functions in such physical systems governed by anomalous diffusion ; specifically , we shall address the following models : ( i ) mutually excluding particles in a driving ` electric ' field @xcite ; here @xmath4 in one space dimension , which is equivalent to the scaling for the noisy burgers equation @xcite , in two dimensions one finds @xmath5 with logarithmic corrections along the drive direction , while normal diffusive behaviour ensues transverse to it , @xmath6 ; ( ii ) critical driven diffusive systems ( driven model b ) @xcite , for which one similarly obtains @xmath7 in dimensions @xmath8 , with again logarithmic corrections at the upper critical dimension @xmath9 , and @xmath6 ; and ( iii ) particle diffusion in a quenched random velocity field , where according to the type of disorder , both super- and sub - diffusive behaviour may occur @xcite .",
    "based on a field theory representation of the non - linear langevin - type stochastic differential equations representing the above processes @xcite , renormalisation group ( rg ) methods will prove instrumental in extracting the appropriate asymptotic scaling variables in the long - time and large - system limit , and will be shown to provide the relevant tool for taking the proper continuum limit @xcite .",
    "the second restriction for most recent investigations is that these studies apply only to systems that are weakly out of equilibrium , since , as already mentioned before , the applied external field scales as the reciprocal of the system size . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", it is only for the one - dimensional exclusion process with periodic boundary conditions , with @xcite or without a bias @xcite in particle propagation , that the current fluctuations have been accessed analytically to date .",
    "the efforts of the present paper therefore bear on systems with anomalous diffusion in dimensions @xmath10 , some of which driven far away from thermal equilibrium .    in the course of this work we shall investigate the properties of the current large deviation in three different systems , which we define succinctly in the following subsection . in sections 2 , 3 , and 4 we present the rg analysis and our results for each of these model systems",
    ". section  2 itself will also expand on the field - theoretic methods upon which we shall rely , whereas most of the technical details will be skipped in the subsequent sections 3 and 4 .",
    "our conclusions are gathered in section 5 .",
    "we will first investigate the properties of particles ( without source nor sink ) subjected to a driving force along one spatial direction ( denoted ` @xmath11 ' in the following ) , whose local density @xmath12 evolves according to the continuity equation @xmath13 , with a particle current @xmath14 constructed from phenomenological considerations .",
    "the first term here is a fickian diffusion current , the second contribution originates from the driving force and describes a density - dependent velocity field @xmath15 along the drive , and finally @xmath16 represents gaussian white noise which accounts for fast degrees of freedom not taken into account explicitly in our mesoscopic description .",
    "the former continuum langevin description arises for instance from a discrete lattice gas description , which we shall use in the following to determine the particular form of the velocity field @xmath15 .",
    "if we transform from a lattice occupation number representation ( @xmath17 ) of the discretised system ( with lattice sites labeled by the index @xmath18 ) to ising variables @xmath19 , particle - hole ( @xmath20 ) symmetry dictates that to lowest order in the coarse - grained local density field @xmath21 we have @xmath22 .",
    "denoting by @xmath23 the average current , renaming @xmath24 , and allowing for a different effective diffusivity @xmath25 along the drive direction , we thus arrive at the following expressions for the transverse and longitudinal ( component along the drive ) currents @xmath26 the parameter @xmath27 accounts for the interaction of particles along the driving field .",
    "after rescaling such that the transverse current sector is effectively in equilibrium , the noise correlations read @xmath28 collecting everything into a single stochastic langevin equation for the density field @xmath29 , we at last arrive at @xmath30 where @xmath31 . further motivations for this phenomenological approach , and a detailed study of the scaling properties of this model can be found in @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that in the presence of a drive , and with periodic boundary conditions , and in general describe a non - equilibrium system . in one dimension",
    ", they reduce to the noisy burgers equation @xcite .    for our second example",
    ", we turn to the standard model of a driven diffusive system that exhibits a continuous non - equilibrium phase transition in its stationary state @xcite . in this case , the transverse current looks like the one for the time - dependent ginzburg  landau model with conserved order parameter , @xmath32 while the current component along the drive direction is still given by , and the noise correlations by and . for the field",
    "@xmath29 , this yields the langevin equation @xmath33 with the noise correlator .",
    "the system now has a critical point at @xmath34 ( within the mean - field approximation ) , which in the absence of the drive @xmath35 just describes the second - order phase transition in the ising model with kawasaki dynamics ( model b ) . in the presence of the drive ( @xmath36 ) , however , the universality class changes ; in fact , @xmath37 becomes irrelevant for the critical properties of the driven model b , which are entirely governed by the non - linear driving term @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider non - interacting particles diffusing in a random velocity field , as defined by honkonen @xcite . at the mesoscopic level ,",
    "the system is described over a @xmath38-dimensional continuum by a local density fluctuation @xmath39 subjected to a random field @xmath40 directed along @xmath41 .",
    "one primary feature of the model is that the amplitude of the field depends only on the transverse coordinates @xmath42 .",
    "the density field @xmath39 evolves according to the langevin equation @xmath43 with a current @xmath44 that accounts for the random field @xmath40 solely in the parallel direction : @xmath45 the thermal diffusion of particles is encoded by the white noise @xmath16 which enters the expression for the current .",
    "its correlations ensure that both the transverse and longitudinal sectors are in equilibrium , @xmath46 depending on the spatial correlations of the random field @xmath47 , particles can behave either sub- or superdiffusively @xcite .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the case of a spatially uncorrelated random field with gaussian distribution , whose correlations are described by a constant amplitude @xmath48 : @xmath49 this has the consequence that particles behave superdiffusively in the longitudinal direction , with a dynamical exponent @xmath50 in dimensions @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the previous systems , the superdiffusion here stems from the anomalous , but _ equilibrium _ wandering of particles in the quenched random velocity field , rather than from interactions that drive the system out of equilibrium .      in each of these systems",
    "the goal will be to determine the probability distribution @xmath52 of the total integrated current in the longitudinal direction @xmath53 up to time @xmath54 , and the related large deviation function ( ldf ) @xmath55 defined by @xmath56 and expressed in terms of the fluctuating time - averaged current @xmath57 . for finite - size systems @xmath55",
    "is peaked around its maximum @xmath58 , which becomes sharper as the system size increases ( i.e. , fluctuations decrease with system size ) . in most physical systems , @xmath55 does not edgewise reduce to a parabolic form  in other words it describes current fluctuations far beyond a gaussian distribution , even in equilibrium . as such",
    ", it appears as a promising tool to probe the distinctive features of ness as compared to equilibrium states .    for systems driven out of equilibrium by a field @xmath59 , the fluctuation relation takes the generic form @xmath60 .",
    "it connects the probabilities of observing longstanding current deviations both close to and far from the steady average @xmath61 .",
    "the fluctuations of the longitudinal current are also fully encoded in the moments or the cumulants of @xmath62 .",
    "we first introduce the generating function @xmath63 \\right\\rangle \\ ; \\ ] ] moments of @xmath62 are then given by the derivatives of @xmath64 at @xmath65 : @xmath66 after resorting to the standard janssen - de dominicis mapping to a field theory @xcite , we arrive for the systems presented above at the generic form @xmath67 } \\ .\\ ] ] the specific expressions for the actions @xmath68 $ ] will be our starting points in the analysis of the systems presented above .",
    "we utilise in our work the action functional field theory developed in @xcite , rather than the operator formalism of @xcite . these related but distinct methods lead to quite different techniques , as for instance recently exemplified in @xcite .",
    "a few remarks are in order before we proceed with evaluating the large deviation function for specific systems .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath64 defined in , does play the role of a partition function , whereas the usual dynamic ` partition function ' @xmath69 ( which expresses the conservation of probability ) and carries no relevant information .",
    "moreover , since the action defined in does not describe a markov process anymore , it is expected that @xmath64 will grow exponentially with time .",
    "it is therefore conventional to introduce a time intensive ` dynamical free energy ' @xmath70 which is related to the current large deviation function @xmath55 as defined in through a legendre transform , @xmath71 formally , the dynamical free energy @xmath72 is nothing but the generating function for the cumulants of the integrated longitudinal current @xmath62 in the asymptotic long - time limit : @xmath73      in analogy with standard thermodynamics , we observe that the quantity @xmath64 introduced in ( [ defz ] ) facilitates the description of current fluctuations in a _",
    "canonical _ way ( i.e. , at fixed intensive parameter @xmath74 ) rather than _ microcanonically _ ( at fixed value of the time - extensive quantity @xmath62 ) .    besides constituting a useful computational trick , introducing @xmath64 also provides us with a physical picture of the very configurations that give birth to large deviations .",
    "although at @xmath75 the action defined in does not correspond to a stochastic process anymore , one can understand @xmath76 $ ] as describing not a single , but rather an _",
    "ensemble _ of systems evolving in parallel , with dynamical rules that favour histories with non - zero longstanding deviation of the particle current @xcite .",
    "the value of physical observables such as correlation functions inferred from @xmath76 $ ] at @xmath77 can thus be understood as the typical value of these observables in a _ modified _",
    "steady state wherein the mean current is enforced to take an average value @xmath78 that is different from the average @xmath61 taken in the steady state .",
    "we see for instance from that negative values of @xmath74 favour histories with an excess current in the direction of the field .",
    "quantitatively , the correspondence between @xmath78 and @xmath74 is the same as in the legendre transform .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further examples and for a numerical exploitation of this picture .",

    "the continuum and large system size limits will be tackled in section [ subsec : ddsren ] with the presentation of the  unavoidably technical  rg analysis of the driven diffusive system we are considering .",

    "again , this anomalous behaviour is exemplified here for the first time .    at the critical dimension @xmath233 , the running coupling @xmath264 which gives the logarithmic correction @xmath265 at the upper critical dimension too , the rg analysis leads to an asymptotically exact result .      as well as allowing access to free energies , the replica trick can also be used to determine the correlation functions , averaged over thermal fluctuations and the random field .",
    "this is achieved by noting that @xmath266 thus we obtain at the tree level the correlation function in the @xmath74-state as @xmath267 the spatio - temporal correlation function reads @xmath268 i.e. , the supplementary correlations in the @xmath74-steady state are still uniform in time and along the longitudinal direction , which means that states conveying a ( slightly ) atypical value of the current do not break theses symmetries of the steady state . including loop corrections to the correlation function does not alter this result , but affects the power @xmath165 in , as a consequence of superdiffusivity .",
    "in the previous sections , we have shown that the implementation of dynamical rg techniques to the already well - studied ( see refs @xcite through @xcite ) dynamical free energy @xmath72 associated with the particle current provides new insights into the singular dynamical _ macroscopic limit _ of large systems . as is the case for the static free energies in thermal equilibrium setups",
    ", @xmath72 exhibits singularities only in the infinite volume limit . in the systems presented in this work ,",
    "@xmath72 becomes non - analytic at @xmath65 , where @xmath74 is the parameter canonically conjugated to the particle current : @xmath269 in finite - size systems , the variance of the integrated current grows with the system size faster than linearly .",
    "we have shown for the systems under consideration here that the exponents @xmath1 were simply related to the respective dynamical exponents @xmath270 through the anomalous exponent for the noise strengths . in our examples , the divergence of the variance ( @xmath271 ) emerges as a direct consequence of superdiffusion ( @xmath272 ) .",
    "our second system provides an example for a current ldf in presence of twofold , namely static _ and _ dynamic criticality .",
    "our final model system constitutes the first example of an _ equilibrium _",
    "system for which the fluctuations of the particle current were shown to produce anomalous scaling with system size .    in previous works , which remained confined to a specific one - dimensional system , namely the asymmetric exclusion process ,",
    "an exponent related to @xmath1 was determined using the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "of course , some of these existing results can be recovered through our field - theoretic methods employed here ( such as the scaling exponent in @xmath273 ) , but we have obtained additional asymptotically exact results in higher dimensions . as well as opening the path to a wide range of applications , our method also connects to other multi - purpose instruments of statistical physics ( such as replicas and supersymmetry for disordered systems ) that can be deftly adapted to describe the @xmath74-dependent states .",
    "as illustrated in sections  [ subseq : correlation_dds ] and  [ subseq : correlation_honk ] , our method also gives access to the correlation functions in the @xmath74-state , which to our knowledge can not be obtained from bethe ansatz computations , but still provides valuable physical information about the critical behaviour in the vicinity of @xmath65 .",
    "finally we remark that for the driven systems investigated here we have not been able to access the @xmath274 states which probe realisations of the process with a current _ opposite _ to the average current .",
    "this is likely because instead of remaining homogeneous in time and space , the typical trajectories develop heterogeneities in this situation .",
    "we may speculate that , as discussed by bodineau and derrida @xcite , non - stationary profiles , perhaps with shock - like spatial structures , will play an important role .",
