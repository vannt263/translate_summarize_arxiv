    "recently , a new flow on riemannian manifolds is introduced by kong and liu(@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : + @xmath2 + this is the hyperbolic version of the famous ricci flow .",
    "they studied its short - time existence in compact case , derived evolutions of curvatures which have wave character .",
    "a dissipative flow was also considered in @xcite .",
    "one remarkable result is @xcite , in which the authors proved that on compact surfaces with metric depending on one space variable , the flow has a global solution if the initial velocity is large enough .",
    "so given an initial metric , the geometric surgery can be replaced by choosing suitable velocity to allow the long - time existence . however , the evolutions of riemann curvature , ricci curvature and the scalar curvature are very complicated which contain the first - order derivative of time that is hard to control . in this paper ,",
    "i consider its complex version which is also introduced by kong and liu in @xcite : + @xmath3 + as we will see on calabi - yau manifolds , it can be reduced to a scalar ( complex ) hyperbolic monge - amp@xmath1re equation which is much easier to handle .",
    "the flow considered here can also be regarded as the hyperbolic version of k@xmath0hler - ricci flow : + @xmath4 + in the past several decades , nonlinear partial differential equations played important role in differential geometry .",
    "for example , the resolutions of calabi s conjecture @xcite and poincar@xmath5 s conjecture @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite are due to the methods of geometric analysis and the elliptic and parabolic type of equations are intensively studied . however , the hyperbolic equations have been ignored for a long time . for the elliptic and parabolic equations",
    ", we have the powerful tool the maximum principle which can not be applied to hyperbolic ones .",
    "this lack of practical tool may explain the reason why the research of hyperbolic equations on manifolds are not as active as the other two types .",
    "however , perelman @xcite @xcite @xcite introduced several powerful tools into the study of flow like the energy functional , the monotonicity formula , and the space - time geometry . in the euclidean space ,",
    "these methods are available for hyperbolic equations .",
    "so i believe we can refer to perelman s methods to study nonlinear hyperbolic equations on manifolds .",
    "hyperbolic equations are important in physics especially in general relativity .",
    "the famous einstein s equation has been studied for a long time .",
    "in fact , as illustrated in @xcite , the hyperbolic version of ricci flow is closely related to einstein s equation .",
    "so i hope , by studying the wave character of manifolds through hyperbolic equations , we can better understand the basic structure of the universe .",
    "there is already some work on wave equations on lorentzian manifolds which catches more interest from physicists .",
    "although wave equations on riemannian manifolds are also considered , the results are few and have a more analytic style that its influence on curvature are not considered . in my opinion , analyzing wave equations on manifolds from a more geometric viewpoint so that it may give more help to understand the geometry and topology of manifolds .",
