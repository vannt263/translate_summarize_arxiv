    "the past years orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access ( ofdma ) has been an important technique for broadband wireless communications .",
    "a major advantage of ofdma is its robustness in the presence of multi - path fading in cellular applications @xcite . in third generation partnership project",
    "long term evolution ( 3gpp - lte ) standard , the uplink access scheme is single - carrier frequency - division multiple access ( sc - fdma ) @xcite , a modified version of ofdma but having similar throughput performance and essentially the same overall complexity as ofdma .",
    "there are two approaches to assign users among channels . in localized sc - fdma ( lfdma ) , each user uses a set of adjacent channels to transmit data @xcite .",
    "the other is distributed sc - fdma in which the channels used by a user are spread over the entire channel spectrum .",
    "one realization of distributed sc - fdma is interleaved sc - fdma ( ifdma ) @xcite where the occupied channels for each user are equidistant from each other .",
    "currently , ifdma as well as lfdma has been investigated in 3gpp - lte for the uplink transmission @xcite .",
    "the trade - off on channel allocation between lfdma and ifdma is investigated in many literatures . in @xcite , song et.al .",
    "state that ifdma has less carrier frequency offset ( cfo ) interference but lfdma achieves more diversity gain . in @xcite myung et.al .",
    "find that lfdma with channel - dependent scheduling ( cds ) results in higher throughput than ifdma , whereas the peak to average power ratio ( papr ) performance of ifdma is better than that of lfdma .",
    "battery - powered equipments are increasingly employed by mobile users .",
    "it is of significance to consider minimum sum power ( min - power ) , subject to meeting demand target @xcite .",
    "the min - power problem for lfdma is proved to be @xmath0-hard in @xcite .",
    "as far as our information goes , few literatures investigate the min - power problem in ifdma , while some heuristic algorithms for consecutive channel allocation are presented in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a minimal power channel allocation ( @xmath1 ) algorithm for ifdma , which achieves global optimality in polynomial time . the min - power in ifdma",
    "is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem .",
    "the rate function is not restricted to any particular one in order to stress the generality of the proposed approach .",
    "we compare mpca with the global optimal solution for lfdma , as same as in @xcite .",
    "our key contributions are as follows .    *",

    "the optimal power cost is @xmath79 .",
    "next we show that for each feasible @xmath74 , the interleaved min - power can be reduced to a maximum weight perfect matching problem . as illustrated in  [ fig : bipartite ] , the nodes in the left part stand for the users , and the nodes in the right part stand for the order in each sub block @xmath33 . then each perfect matching in this bipartite graph is corresponding to a permutation @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "more specifically , any left node numbered @xmath9 is linked with the right node numbered @xmath78 in each matching .",
    "the weight for each link between @xmath9 and @xmath78 is set to be the negative value of the corresponding power cost , respectively .",
    "the minimal power cost is equal to the maximal sum of weights among all perfect matchings .",
    "the channel allocation problem is thereby identical to the maximum weight perfect matching in a bipartite graph , which can be solved by @xmath80 ( km ) algorithm @xcite in @xmath81 .",
    "the details of km are given in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we prove that for interleaved channel allocation , min - power is polynomial - time solvable for global optimality .    for interleaved channel allocation ,",
    "min - power admits polynomial - time algorithm for global optimality .",
    "@xmath82    then @xmath39 is @xmath83 .",
    "we can achieve the global optimality by resorting to the enumeration method , i.e. , to check every possible channel block @xmath84 by running km once .",
    "the total cost for the whole process should be @xmath85 .",
    "in this section , we give the description and pseudo - code of optimal min - power algorithm for the interleaved case , @xmath1 .    in @xmath1 , firstly the procedure @xmath39 is called to obtain all the @xmath36 channel blocks @xmath86 .",
    "the cost for this part is @xmath87 .",
    "then the weight for each corresponding matching between any user - channel pair @xmath88 is calculated for every channel block , as shown in line 25 , of which the cost is @xmath89 . since @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 .",
    "note that we flip the sign for the power cost so as to make sure the min - power to coincide with the maximum matching problem in the bipartite graph .",
    "the set @xmath92 is used to record the past solutions obtained from km algorithm , and is initialized to be empty at the beginning , in line 6 . in line 79 ,",
    "the km procedure is called for all the @xmath36 possible channel blocks and the total cost is @xmath93 . in line 8 ,",
    "the km returns a two tuple @xmath94 , where @xmath66 is the power value and @xmath43 is the corresponding permutation .",
    "finally the two - tuple @xmath94 that minimizes the value @xmath66 , is returned as the optimal solution .",

    "for performance evaluation , we consider sc - fdma uplink of a cell with random and uniform user distribution .",
    "[ tab : simulation ] summarizes the key parameters .",
    "the channel gain consists of path loss , shadowing , as well as rayleigh fading .",
    "the path loss follows the widely used cost 231 model that extends the okumura - hata model for urban scenarios . by the cost 231 model ,",
    "path loss is frequency dependent . log - normal shadowing model with 8 db standard deviation",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "a channel corresponds to a resource block in lte with twelve subcarriers .",
    ".simulation parameters [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we examine two performance aspects .",
    "first , performance evaluation of optimal lfdma @xcite and mpca ( corresponding to ifdma ) for min - power has been carried out . next , we examine the maximal supported user demand of the two allocation schemes .",
    "we remark that the system model ( section [ sec : details ] ) and the mpca algorithm are not restricted to any particular definition of the utility function or power function . for performance comparison ,",
    "the power cost value in min - power are derived from the logarithmic function .",
    "the setting is coherent with the literature @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for user @xmath9 ,",
    "the achieved rate on the whole channels set for the user is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the channel bandwidth , @xmath107 is the channel gain for user @xmath9 on channel @xmath32 , and @xmath108 is the noise power spectral density times the channel bandwidth . if assigning channels to user @xmath9 is feasible , the maximal cost of the assignment is clearly @xmath109 .",
    "so channel assignment is feasible only if the achieved rate over the channels set meets the demand , i.e. , if @xmath110 , otherwise the assignment is infeasible and can not be performed .",
    "uniform demand is used in the simulation , with @xmath111 kbps , @xmath112 .",
    "[ fig : plot1 ] shows the evaluation results of both lfdma and ifdma on varying the user demand .",
    "the user power limit @xmath19 is set to be 200 mw and the channel peak power limit @xmath20 is 10 mw .",
    "we can see from the results that lfdma performs slightly better than ifdma on minimal power consumption .",
    "besides , when the user demand is set to be more than 1.4 mbps , there is no feasible solution by using ifdma .",
    "however , lfdma can still support user demand higher than 1.4mbps .",
    "we give the maximal supported user demands results in  [ fig : plot2 ] .",
    "it can be seen from  [ fig : plot2 ] that the maximal supported user demands are distinctive between lfdma and ifdma .",
    "the user power limit @xmath19 is constant at 200 mw and the channel peak power limit @xmath20 is set to be 10 mw , as same as in  [ fig : plot1 ] .",
    "regarding for  [ fig : plot2 ] , the consecutive channel allocation scheme shows an outstanding performance compared with the interleaved scheme , since the maximal supported power cost for lfdma is about twice of that for ifdma .    for min - power problem ,",
    "though the lfdma outperforms ifdma in numerical experiments in both  [ fig : plot1 ] and  [ fig : plot2 ] , ifdma is polynomial - time solvable for global optimality .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the min - power problem on both ifdma and lfdma .",
    "we proved that min - power in ifdma is polynomial - time solvable .",
    "then the interleaved min - power problem was mapped to a maximum weight perfect matching problem in a bipartite graph , which can be solved by resorting to the classic km approach .",
