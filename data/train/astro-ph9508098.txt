    "modeling the gravitational structure of a galaxy , and therefore its lensing properties , requires knowledge of the extent , radial profile , and geometric form of its mass distribution .",
    "the interpretation of microlensing rates and optical depths along different lines of sight through the milky way , for example , is strongly dependent on the assumed distribution of total ( light and dark ) galactic mass . on larger scales , efficient and reliable image - inversion techniques designed to measure the structure parameters of intervening lensing galaxies require appropriate fitting functions for the lensing mass .",
    "this review focuses on techniques that form a symbiotic relationship with lensing in producing valuable and complementary constraints on galactic potentials , especially in providing partial answers to the following questions about galactic _",
    "dark _ mass :    * what is the physical extent of dark matter in galaxies ?",
    "* is the distribution of dark mass isothermal ? * what is the shape of dark `` halos '' ?",
    "the size of dark halos controls the galactic `` sphere of influence '' for lensing , interactions , and accretion . together with the radial and vertical structure parameters , halo extent determines the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "the notion of halos as distinct entities ceases to be useful , of course , on scales larger than half the mean distance to the nearest , comparably - sized neighbor .    if halos are extremely large and isothermal , they can not be totally baryonic without violating the constraints on @xmath0 from primordial big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) models .",
    "recent assessments give @xmath1 for @xmath2 ( walker  1991 , smith , kawano & malaney 1993 ) .",
    "since the density of observed baryons is @xmath3 ( pagel 1990 ) , the average ratio of dark - to - luminous baryons is @xmath4 , and at least some of the universe s baryons are dark .",
    "rotation curve analysis indicates that @xmath5 (  broeils 1992 ) , so that on scales comparable to  disks ( @xmath630  kpc ) , halos composed entirely of dark baryons are consistent with bbn .",
    "faint galaxies are more numerous and more dark matter dominated than brighter galaxies , but contribute less to the total luminosity of the universe .",
    "thus the upper limit placed by bbn on the size of baryonic halos is likely to be considerably larger than 30  kpc ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , but its calculation requires a model - dependent integral over the galaxy luminosity function , weighted by @xmath7 .      at large radius , the mass of our galaxy can be estimated from the kinematics of distant , presumably bound , objects  halos stars , satellite galaxies , and group members  and from the kinematics of magellanic clouds / stream system .",
    "the former has been done most recently by kochanek ( 1995 ) , who finds that , using a jaffe model as the global mass distribution for the galaxy , the total mass inside 50  kpc at 90% confidence is @xmath8 if the timing constraints of the local group are imposed and leo i is bound , and somewhat lower at @xmath9 if the timing constraints are not imposed .",
    "the corresponding masses within 100  kpc are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "a recent re - examination of the kinematics and proper motions of the magellanic clouds and stream using two different model potentials for the milky way ( lin , jones & kremola 1995 ) yields @xmath12 inside 100  kpc . about one - half this mass must lie _ outside _ the present cloud distance ( 50  kpc ) in order to explain with these models the observed infall of the magellanic stream .    since the luminous matter in the galaxy accounts for @xmath13 , the full range of dark mass estimates from these two methods is @xmath14 , with apparent contradictions at the lower end with local group timing and at the upper end with magellanic stream kinematics .",
    "the implied upper limit of @xmath15 from the magellanic stream model is only just consistent with the lower limit of @xmath16 from the satellite model . for comparison , the spherical isothermal dark halo used by many microlensing teams as a fiducial model contains @xmath17 interior to the lmc distance of 50 kpc ( griest 1991 ) . using this model and its first year s lmc data ,",
    "the macho team concludes with 68% confidence that the total mass in compact dark lenses is @xmath18 ( alcock  1995 ) .",
    "( for more complete reviews of the mass of the galaxy and its dependence on assumptions about leo i , see fich & tremaine 1991 , schechter 1993 , and freeman , these proceedings . )",
    "the kinematics of satellites can also be used to study the halos of external galaxies , but since only a small number of satellites are observed per primary , conclusions are based on a statistical analysis of the sample as a whole .",
    "based on satellite velocities and  rotation curves , erickson , gottesman and hunter ( 1987 ) concluded that the primaries in their sample have @xmath19 , total @xmath20 , and potentials that are well - described by a point mass model  all consistent with dark halos that extend no more than 3 disk radii . in a more recent study using a different sample , however ,",
    "zaritsky and white ( 1994 ) conclude that halos are nearly isothermal , with total @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( for @xmath23 ) .",
    "their result is primarily due to secondaries at 200 - 300  kpc , where the orbital times are on the order of a hubble time , thus necessitating the use of halo formation models to interpret the satellite kinematics .",
    "using their method , zaritsky and white conclude that the erickson  sample , which has smaller mean primary - satellite separation , is consistent with both small and large mass halos .    in the future ,",
    "weak lensing is likely to play a larger role in constraining the extent of dark halos .",
    "recent work by brainerd , blandford and smail ( these proceedings ) has given the first indication that the tangential distortion of background galaxies due to weak lensing by foreground galaxies is statistically measurable for a large sample ( @xmath24 ) of source - lens pairs .",
    "their measurement of @xmath25 for the total mass within 100 @xmath26 kpc is consistent both with a mass distribution that grows linearly to 100  kpc and one that truncates much sooner with total @xmath27 .",
    "the ring of  gas in the m96 group in leo ( schneider 1985 ) offers the rare opportunity to sample galactic potentials at very large radii using the well - defined orbits of cold gas .",
    "the leo ring has a radius of 100 kpc and completely encircles the early - type galaxies m105 and ngc  3384 .",
    "the radial velocities and spatial distribution of the gas are consistent with a single , elliptical _ keplerian _",
    "orbit with a center - of - mass velocity equal to the centroid of the galaxy pair , and a focus that can be placed at the barycenter of the system without compromising the fit . the implied dynamical mass within 100  kpc is @xmath28 , ( only twice that inferred from the internal dynamics of the galaxies ) , giving a total @xmath29 .",
    "the sensitivity of non - circular orbits to the power law form of the potential suggests that dark matter does not extend much beyond the ring pericenter radius of 60  kpc . as a caveat",
    ", it is yet clear to what degree m96 , a spiral located 60  kpc ( in projection ) outside the ring , may perturb the ring kinematics .",
    "the approximate flatness of  rotation curves is the best observational evidence that dark matter is present in spirals and has a shallower density profile than the light ; an isothermal halo is as shallow as @xmath30 .",
    "early theoretical studies ( gott 1975 ) suggested that violent relaxation would cause the inner regions of galaxies to have steeply falling profiles that would flatten to @xmath31 in the outer parts . more recent cdm models ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) indicate that dark halo profiles may be shallower than @xmath30 in the center and quite steep near the virial radius .",
    "compression by a dissipating gaseous disk may further contract and flatten the dark matter ( blumenthal  1986 ) , accounting in part for the apparent `` conspiracy '' between the dark and luminous mass that produces flat rotation curves .",
    "the radial structure of the mass and light in the milky way is less well - constrained than in external galaxies .",
    "determining the rotation curve of the galaxy , in particular , has proven notoriously difficult . on the other hand , distances and kinematics of old ,",
    "resolved stars can be used to measure the vertical restoring force of the local disk  and thus its surface mass density . in this way ,",
    "kuijken and gilmore ( 1991 ) report a mass column of @xmath32 within a 1.1  kpc band from the galactic plane , with @xmath33 due to the disk itself , and the rest contributed by a rounder halo .",
    "other recent estimates are similar : gould ( 1990 ) weighs in at @xmath34 , bahcall , flynn and gould ( 1992 ) at @xmath34 , and flynn and fuchs ( 1994 ) at @xmath35 .",
    "the dynamical disk mass thus seems to be in remarkable agreement with the detectable disk mass of @xmath36  at least locally , almost none of the disk mass is dark .",
    "since only about one - half of the local rotation support is provided by the observable disk , this further implies that dark matter in the galaxy is dynamically important at radii as small as 2.5 disk scale lengths",
    ". stated in the language of  4.2 , the milky way disk is one - half of its `` maximal disk '' value .",
    "unfortunately , uncertainties in the outer galactic rotation curve frustrate attempts to determine the distribution of mass in the outer galaxy , which is further complicated by a recent suggestion that the generally - accepted local rotation speed , @xmath37 , may be overestimated by @xmath610% ( merrifield 1992 ) .",
    "a smaller value would increase the relative dynamical importance of the luminous disk and decrease the slope of the outer rotation curve , to which @xmath38 is tied .",
    "conclusions drawn from microlensing results about the dark baryonic content of the milky way depend on the assumed distribution of dark _ and _ luminous matter in the galaxy (  paczyski , these proceedings ) .",
    "many studies have explored how different assumptions for @xmath39 , rotation curve slope , and the shape , truncation radius and radial profile of the halo affect these conclusions (  references in griest  1995 ) . as an indication of the importance of _ luminous _ structure , lensing by stellar bars in the milky way and",
    "the lmc has been held accountable , respectively , for most of the optical depth toward the galactic center ( zhao , spergel & rich 1995 ) and the lmc ( sahu 1994 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the galactic disk were `` maximal , '' the macho results toward the lmc would be consistent with a dark halo entirely composed of lensing baryons ( alcock  1995 ) .",
    "in contrast to the difficulties in the milky way , surface brightness profiles and rotation curves for external galaxies can be measured well , but their disk mass - to - light ratios , @xmath39 , are uncertain .",
    "a disk @xmath39 that is constant with radius ( but varies from galaxy to galaxy ) can explain the kinematics within the optical radius of many spirals (  kalnajs 1983 , kent 1986 , buchhorn 1992 ) , but the high velocities observed at the edges of  disks can be reproduced only by invoking a rapid radial increase in @xmath39 (  kent 1987 , begeman 1987 ) . since the age and metallicity gradients inferred from the blueing radial color gradients in spirals do not produce these strong , _ positive _ gradients in @xmath39 (  de  jong 1995 ) , dark matter is implicated .    in order to estimate conservatively the amount of dark matter in a galaxy , the `` maximum disk hypothesis ''",
    "is often adopted ( van albada & sancisi 1987 ) , which fixes the disk @xmath39 at the value that maximizes the disk mass without violating kinematic constraints .",
    "the hypothesis is controversial (  rubin 1987 , casertano & van albada 1990 , freeman 1993 ) , but when it is used to fit rotation curves , the resulting disk @xmath39 are larger for brighter and earlier type spirals than for fainter and later type spirals ( broeils 1992 , buchhorn 1992 ) .",
    "the correlation appears to be stronger in bluer bands .",
    "these trends may be due to the older stellar populations associated with early spirals , a notion supported by comparison with the @xmath39 derived from stellar population synthesis models ( athanassoula , bosma & papaioannou 1987 ) and the observed stellar dispersions in spirals ( van der kruit & freeman 1986 ) .",
    "alternatively , they may reflect trends in dark matter properties with galaxy type and luminosity that are incorrectly characterized by the application of maximum disk models ( van der kruit 1995 ) .",
    "-1.3 cm = -2.0 cm    -0.5 cm    it should be stressed that _ rotation curves do not constrain the dark matter distribution to have a @xmath30 ( isothermal ) volume density profile_. if ( 1 ) rotation curves were perfectly flat , ( 2 ) halos were spherical , and ( 3 ) the luminous mass were negligible , then indeed dark matter halos could be described by singular isothermal spheres over the radial range of the kinematics . in fact , rotation curves are seldom flat , but instead have slopes that are systematically related to the peak speed or the luminosity concentration of the galaxy ( kent 1987 , athanassoula , bosma & papaioannou 1987 , casertano & van gorkom 1991 , broeils 1992 ) : diffuse , slow rotators have rising rotation curves , while compact , fast rotators have falling curves .",
    "evidence is mounting that dark halos are not spherical (  5 ) .",
    "finally , since the stellar mass is not strongly constrained , dark halos with asymptotic @xmath40 and @xmath41 density profiles are also consistent with observed rotation curves ( lake & feinswog 1989 ) .",
    "even when @xmath30 halos are used to fit rotation curves  together with luminous disks of reasonable @xmath39  a large core radius must be assumed , so that the halo does not achieve its asymptotic ( isothermal ) speed at the last measured point ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is especially true of maximum disk fits (  broeils 1992 ) , but often applies to fits that assume smaller disk masses as well (  kent 1987 ) .",
    "this suggests that the linewidth of the  gas used in the tully - fisher relation is probably not governed by the asymptotic speed of an isothermal dark halo .",
    "rotation curve inversion is a step toward a model - independent method for determining the radial distribution of dark mass in galaxies .",
    "the technique has been criticized as being sensitive to noise ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , but for this application the typical uncertainties of 10 - 20% are quite tolerable .",
    "the method does depend on the assumed geometry of the mass and extrapolation of the rotation curve beyond the last measured point ( fig .  1 ) , but has the advantage of making this dependence explicit rather than camouflaging it by the use of a particular model for the dark mass .",
    "use of term `` halo '' to describe the distribution of dark matter may be prejudicial : there is no strong theoretical or observational evidence to indicate that dark matter in galaxies is distributed spherically .",
    "dark halos have been favored over dark disks as a means to stabilize galaxies against bar formation ( ostriker & peebles 1973 ) , but bulges ( kalnajs 1987 ) and hot disks ( athanassoula & sellwood 1987 ) are now believed to be more efficient stabilizers . traditional rotation curve analysis is insensitive to vertical structure , but accumulating observational evidence from other methods suggests that the dark mass may be considerably flattened toward the stellar plane , while remaining relatively axisymmetric , with an in - plane axis ratio of @xmath42 ( see review by rix 1995 ) .    here , we focus on @xmath43 , the vertical flattening of dark matter , since it is likely to have the stronger implications for both microlensing in the galaxy (  gould , miralda - escud , & bahcall 1994 ) , and the use of macrolensing as a probe of galaxy structure",
    ". the flattening of the dark mass may also provide a clue as to the nature of its constituents .",
    "n - body simulations of dissipationless collapse produce strongly triaxial dark halos ( frenk  1988 , dubinski & carlberg 1991 , warren  1992 ) , but adding a small fraction ( @xmath610% ) of dissipative gas results in halos of a more consistent shape  nearly oblate , @xmath44 , but moderately flattened , @xmath45 ( katz & gunn 1991 , dubinski 1994 ) .",
    "thus strongly flattened halos , with @xmath46 , may imply that dissipation has played an even greater role , perhaps implicating baryonic dark matter .    in order to measure @xmath43 of the dark mass , a probe of the vertical gradient of the potential",
    "is required . in the milky way , the measured anisotropy of the velocity dispersion of extreme population ii",
    "halo stars has been used to estimate the flattening of the mass distribution ( binney , may & ostriker 1987 , van  der  marel 1991 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the results depend on the unknown orbital structure of the stellar halo , so that @xmath43 can be confined only to lie between 0.3 and 1 at the solar neighborhood .    in external galaxies ,",
    "buote and canizares ( 1994 , 1995 ) have used the flattening of extended x - ray isophotes , assuming that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , to place constraints on the flattening of the dark matter in two early - type systems . for the elliptical ngc  720",
    ", they find that the dark isodensity contours have axis ratio @xmath47 at 90% confidence ; for the lenticular ngc  1332 , @xmath48 .",
    "this suggests that these dark halos are at least as flattened as their corresponding luminous galaxies , which have optical isophotes of axis ratio @xmath49 .",
    "these values contrast with that of @xmath50 derived for the s0 ngc  4753 by steiman - cameron , kormendy & durisen ( 1992 ) on the basis of fitting an inclined , precessing disk model to the complicated pattern of the galaxy s dust lanes .",
    "their remarkably good fit is independent of @xmath43 ; the flattening constraints are based on the assumption that the gas is smoothly distributed and has completed at least 6 orbits at all radii .",
    "stable rings around galaxies are not observed to have random orientations , but are found preferentially close to the equatorial or polar planes , suggesting that the potential may be oblate . in particular , polar ring galaxies ( prgs ) are surrounded by rings of gas and stars in orbits nearly perpendicular to the central stellar plane ; these rings can extend to 20 disk scale lengths .",
    "since in an oblate potential closed ring orbits are elongated along the polar axis and have speeds that vary with ring azimuth , the shape and kinematics of a polar ring are excellent extended probes of @xmath43 .",
    "early kinematic analyses of three prgs produced axes ratios for the _ potentials _ of @xmath51 with uncertainties of 0.2 ( schweizer , whitmore & rubin 1983 , whitmore , mcelroy & schweizer 1987 ) , corresponding to @xmath52 with very large uncertainties .",
    "subsequent studies using more detailed mass models and higher quality data over a larger radial range have narrowed the range for the dark mass to @xmath53 ( arnaboldi  1993 , sackett  1994 , sackett & pogge 1995 ) ; in each galaxy , @xmath43 is similar to the inferred flattening of the central _ stellar _ body .",
    "measurements of @xmath43 for spiral galaxies are rarer , more difficult , and sorely needed . assuming that gas disks evolve gravitationally toward a discrete bending mode in tilted rigid halos , hofner and sparke ( 1994 ) find that moderate halo flattening of @xmath54 can reproduce the observed  warps of five spirals . in principle , @xmath43  can also be constrained by the flaring of the  layer ; in the most detailed study of this type , olling and van  gorkom ( 1995 ) obtain @xmath55 for the dark halo of the sc ngc  4244 . since non - gravitational energy sources may be responsible for a substantial fraction of the vertical support of gas ( malhotra 1995 , and references therein ) , this measurement may be an upper limit to @xmath56 .",
    "since the mass distribution in cluster galaxies may be modified by the interactions and violent relaxation that shape the evolving cluster potential , we have restricted this review to relatively isolated galaxies that are more likely to be dynamically relaxed .",
    "furthermore , we have largely ignored ellipticals , the inner few kpc of which are thought to be responsible for the strong lensing of distant qsos and radio sources . although selection effects operate to favor flattened lenses in multiply - imaged systems ( kassiola & kovner 1993 ) , image inversion techniques yield lenses that are surprisingly flattened ( kochanek 1995a , and references therein )  the _ projected _ @xmath57 corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "can these flat lenses be reconciled with the axis ratio distribution of ellipticals , which peaks at @xmath59 ( ryden 1992 ) , or are disk galaxies implicated ?"
