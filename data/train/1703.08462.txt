    "analytical and numerical results strongly suggest that the dynamics of the universe on approach to the big - crunch / big - bang singularity is dominated by the time derivatives of the gravitational field @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the dynamics at each spatial point becomes ultralocal , oscillatory and chaotic and it is driven entirely by the gravitational self - energy .",
    "these generic features are exemplified by the mixmaster universe @xcite , which is a model of spatially homogeneous and anisotropic spacetime with the incorporated bianchi type ix symmetry . in the context of quantum gravity",
    ", the mixmaster universe seems to be an ideal tool for testing whether quantization can resolve the problem of classical singularities .",
    "the canonical formalism of the mixmaster universe in the misner variables describes the universe in terms of a particle in a 3-dimensional minkowski spacetime in a potential .",
    "the potential represents the spatial curvature of the universe whose geometry deviates from isotropy .",
    "the anisotropy potential is a sophisticated function of two variables and it is challenging to study it analytically . the usual approximations employed in the literature , the harmonic and the steep wall approximations , are based on a conjecture that the exact energy spectrum of a particle in the anisotropy potential is discrete .",
    "moreover , the validity of both approximations has never been rigorously studied and in particular , it has never been associated with the size of the universe .    in the present paper",
    "we fill those crucial gaps in the knowledge of the properties of the bianchi ix anisotropy potential .",
    "the immediate application of these results is to foster the development of quantum theory of the mixmaster universe proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , the results are universal and they should be useful for any approach to quantization of the mixmaster model like the misner approach , the wheeler - dewitt approach , loop quantum cosmology and other ones .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recall the essential elements of the canonical formalism for the mixmaster universe and in particular we discuss the anisotropy potential .",
    "iii deals with the asymptotic analysis of the spectrum of the quantum model in two opposite situations : of a large and small universe . in particular , we improve the steep wall approximation which is widely used in the literature . in sec . iv we prove that the spectrum associated with the anisotropy potential is purely discrete irrespectively of the size of the universe .",

    "the spacetime variables have the following cosmological interpretation : @xmath7 hence , the variable @xmath8 describes the isotropic part of geometry , whereas @xmath9 describe distortions to the isotropic geometry and are referred to as the anisotropic variables . the hamiltonian constraint ( [ con ] ) can be decomposed as a sum of isotropic and anisotropic parts which read ( up to a non - vanishing factor ) @xmath10    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the potential @xmath11 deserves particular attention due to its three `` open '' @xmath12 symmetry directions .",
    "one can view them as three deep `` canyons '' , increasingly narrow until their respective wall edges close up at the infinity whereas their respective bottoms tend to zero ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",

    "@xmath11 behaves as the two - dimensional isotropic harmonic potential : @xmath17 away from its minimum , the so - called steep wall approximation applies as @xmath11 tends to an equilateral triangle potential with its infinitely steep walls .",

    "( [ condec ] ) that during the evolution of the universe towards the singular point , @xmath18 and the factor in front of the potential @xmath11 goes to zero , @xmath19 . therefore ,",
    "as the universe contracts the potential walls move apart and the particle penetrates larger and larger parts of the anisotropy space @xmath20 .",
    "from the point of view of quantization ( see @xcite for details ) it is useful to replace the isotropic variables @xmath21 with ones that bring the singular point to finite values , namely : @xmath22 the anisotropic part of the quantised hamiltonian constraint ( [ condec ] ) reads as the @xmath23-dependent schrdinger operator , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 acts in the hilbert space @xmath27 .",

    "however , no proof of nonexistence of continuous spectrum of the schrdinger operator has been given so far .",

    "firstly , it is worth to note that the label @xmath5 in eq . is not an ordering parameter ( @xmath5 is complex ) , and the quantum numbers ( integers ) @xmath70 and @xmath69 are different from those appearing in the harmonic case ( @xmath75 ) in eq . .",
    "therefore we can not connect analytically both asymptotic expressions .",
    "nevertheless , the ordering between eigenvalues for each limit ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) is meaningful and the @xmath23-dependence of the respective eigenenergies can be analysed .    secondly , the asymptotic hamiltonians ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) do not possess a continuous spectrum .",
    "this constitutes a strong argument in support of the conjecture that @xmath26 has no continuous spectrum for any value of @xmath23 .",

    "this asymptotic analysis of eigenvalues does not give the threshold value @xmath78 that separates the two regimes of validity of the expression given in eqs and .",
    "probably , @xmath78 is an increasing function of the energy level and the harmonic approximation is expected to become a very poor approximation for large excitations and near the singularity @xmath79 .",

    "( [ steep ] ) is missing in the quantum energy formula and leads to the false idea that the quantum eigenenergies behave exactly as @xmath81 close to the singularity .",
    "this rough approximation has no qualitative consequence on the results of misner s paper .",
    "however , in our previous papers @xcite we have proved that the affine quantisation of the isotropic dynamics given by the hamiltonian constraint ( [ condec ] ) produces a repulsive potential term @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , in our case this corrected dependence in @xmath80 is crucial as the following formula shows the repulsive potential to be always dominant close to the singularity .",
    "it proves that a bounce must always exist , independently of the harmonic approximation used in our previous papers .",
    "the harmonic approximation appears just as a simplified bouncing scenario ( probably a smoother one ) , but the existence of bounce itself is unquestionable ( at least in the adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "this point is crucial to validate our results in @xcite beyond the framework of the harmonic approximation .",

    "the domain of @xmath85 is non - compact . ]",
    "there exists in the mathematical literature a general criterion for non - compact potentials to originate purely discrete spectra .",
    "it was proved by wang and wu in 2008 @xcite . a clear account of this result was later given by simon in @xcite .",
    "these authors assert that the schrdinger operator in any dimension : @xmath86 has a purely discrete spectrum if the lebesgue measure @xmath87 of the projection set @xmath88 is finite : @xmath89 in the next section , we apply this criterion to prove that the spectrum of the hamiltonian is purely discrete .",

    "this result validates implementation of approximations of the potential , which remove the three non - compact canyons and lead to more manageable schrdinger operators .",
    "furthermore , our study of the asymptotic expressions for the eigenenergies at large and small values of @xmath23 establishes several interesting facts .",
    "first , the harmonic approximation used in @xcite corresponds in fact to the mathematical asymptotic expression for large values of @xmath23 .",
    "second , the exact asymptotic behavior for small @xmath23 is not the one given by misner in @xcite : the factor @xmath80 is missing in misner s formula .",
    "then , thanks to the @xmath80 factor , eq . proves that the repulsive potential term @xmath82 present in @xcite is always dominant close to the singularity , even if the harmonic approximation is not valid .",
    "this point is crucial in validating our previous results on bouncing scenarios beyond the framework of the harmonic approximation .    finally , our asymptotic analysis of the spectrum is unable to give the threshold value @xmath78 that separates the two asymptotic regimes .",
    "only a qualitative knowledge of @xmath78 ( certainly dependent on the level of excitation ) would validate the domain of the harmonic approximation .",
