    "pad approximants ( pas ) have been shown recently to be very useful for describing meson transition form factors from the analysis of space - like ( sl ) experimental data @xcite .",
    "such parameterizations based on the measurement of sl data have been used to extrapolate our knowledge of the form factors down to the low - energy limit @xmath7 , thus extracting the low - energy parameters ( leps ) , and up to the high - energy limit @xmath8 , then predicting the asymptotic behavior . moreover ,",
    "they have been employed to reconstruct the double - virtual transition form factor @xcite .",
    "pas are now regarded as a valuable tool for incorporating available data into problems requiring a precise error estimation .",
    "they conform a data - driven approach that can be considered as simple , systematic and model independent , the latter because one can provide a systematic error which can be reduced as soon as more experimental data is included .",
    "these pas applied to the pseudoscalar transition form factors ( tffs ) are utilized in the evaluation of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons contributions to the hadronic light - by - light piece of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xcite , the calculation of the @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 rare decays @xcite , the extraction of the @xmath3-@xmath0 mixing parameters @xcite , the analysis of @xmath11 , @xmath3 and @xmath12 single and double dalitz decays @xcite , and in the quest for dark photons @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "they provide an excellent laboratory for synergic studies between theory and experiment .",
    "the pas @xmath13 to a given function @xmath14 are ratios of two polynomials ( with degree @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) , constructed such that their taylor expansion around the origin exactly coincides with that of the function up to the highest possible order , i.e. , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "they often provide a means of obtaining information about the function outside its circle of convergence , and more rapidly evaluating the function within it .",
    "however , in spite of being flexible and user friendly , pas reconstructed from their power series at the origin are rational functions with a simple analytical structure given by a set of poles .",
    "therefore , they do not possess branch cuts and can not be used to predict the position of resonance poles , which are hidden in the second riemann sheet of the complex energy plane .",
    "similarly , pas reconstructed using information on the branch cut , which allow for a precise determination of the resonance pole parameters @xcite , are not suitable for the extraction of the leps , i.e. , pas in their simplest form considered here can not access different riemann sheets . nonetheless , for special kind of functions , such as stieltjes @xcite or non - stieltjes but meromorphic functions",
    "@xcite , convergence theorems for pas are known . to apply these theorems , an understanding of the analytical properties of the functions",
    "is required in advanced .",
    "when this knowledge is missing , the practitioner would explore a sequence of pas and expect a pattern of convergence .",
    "even when convergence is guaranteed in advanced , this will be restricted by the limits of the theorem s applicability .",
    "the question is whether observing convergence beyond these limits one could infer , within some uncertainties , the approximate analytical structure of the function under consideration .    in this work",
    ", we will explore this last insight taking the @xmath0 tff as a proof of concept . within certain approximations , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proved the tff to be a stieltjes function for which the pa convergence is guaranteed in the sl and the time like ( tl ) below the production threshold  @xcite",
    ". not only that , but its rate of convergence is also known  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , convergence along the branch cut is not _ a priori _ ensured by the mathematical theorem . as we will see later",
    ", the particularities of the tff along the branch cut will decide on the success of our approximation .",
    "we will try to learn and extract from the employed sequence of pas details on the analytical properties of this tff in the energy regime covered by experimental data . in our previous analyses of the tffs from sl data",
    ", we have always carefully expressed the limits on the range of applicability of pas @xcite .",
    "initially , pas could be analytically continued from the sl region to the tl one , but only up to the first singularity , usually a branch cut in the form of a production threshold .",
    "for instance , in the case of the single dalitz decay @xmath18 pas can be safely extended into the tl region up to the pion mass since no branch cuts are present . on the contrary , for",
    "the @xmath19 decays , with @xmath20 , the presence of the @xmath21 branch cut could in principle limit the application of pas in the tl region .",
    "however , the @xmath22 decay and its associated tff in the tl region was recently measured with great accuracy by the a2 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the authors compared their measurement with several theoretical predictions , among them ours , based on sl parameterizations of the tff in terms of pas @xcite , and found that these pas show the best agreement with data for the full range of @xmath23 invariant masses reached in the experiment .",
    "this nice result challenged our understanding of the pas method and triggered , for the first time , a combined analysis of the @xmath3 tff from both sl and tl experimental data @xcite .",
    "the reason for that agreement can be understood by the fact that the branch cut in this decay ( @xmath21 unitary cut ) is not resonant inside the available phase - space region since the @xmath24 resonance is well beyond the @xmath3 mass .",
    "the pas will fail for sure at the first pole encountered on the real axis , or , to be more precise , will start failing at some point near the pole dalitz decays can be obtained from @xcite . ] . in any case , for the @xmath3 tff , this pole on the real axis is found to be at @xmath25 mev for the single - pole parameterization used frequently by the experimental collaborations @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath19 decays the pas can also be extended into the tl region up to the @xmath3 mass with excellent accuracy .",
    "the case of the @xmath26 dalitz decays is more cumbersome since the available phase space this time includes the resonant region .",
    "however , the analysis performed in @xcite on the @xmath0 tff using only sl data revealed that the pole on the real axis for the single - pole parameterization is located at @xmath27 mev . in order to estimate the region of influence of this pole",
    "one can make use of the half - width rule @xcite . in this case , the @xmath24 and @xmath28 resonances are within the phase - space region and the @xmath29 is not far from its end point .",
    "taking the values of their masses and widths from the pdg @xcite , the application of this rule gives @xmath30 mev @xcite .",
    "this value of the effective pole is compatible with the result obtained before from the single - pole parameterization , thus showing that the pole found at @xmath31 mev is somewhat a kind of weighted average of the three existing resonance poles .",
    "the range given by the half - width rule above implies that the region of influence of the former pole is from @xmath32 mev to @xmath33 mev .",
    "consequently , for the @xmath0 tff the pas can also be used in a safe manner up to around @xmath34 mev in the tl region resonance . as a result",
    ", we obtained that the lowest value of the region of influence in that case was around @xmath35 mev . ] .",
    "recently , the besiii collaboration reported the first measurement of the @xmath23 invariant - mass distribution for the @xmath36 decay up to @xmath37 mev @xcite .",
    "as discussed , our prediction for the tl region of the @xmath0 tff based solely on sl data should be able to describe this new measurement . in figure [ fig1 ] , the besiii experimental extraction of the modulus square of the @xmath0 tff as a function of the @xmath23 invariant - mass @xmath38",
    "is compared with our theoretical prediction .",
    "it is worth remarking that this is not a fit but a prediction and the agreement is seen to be excellent .",
    "transition form factor in the time - like region obtained from the @xmath39 fit to space - like data performed in @xcite .",
    "experimental points are from the besiii measurement in @xcite . ]",
    "the main purpose of the present work is therefore to further improve our determination of the @xmath0 tff taking into consideration not only the existing sl experimental data but also the new set of tl data from the recent besiii measurement .",
    "this combined analysis will allow us to better determine the leps of the tff , its normalization and the asymptotic limit .",
    "such an enhancement permits to reconsider the @xmath3-@xmath0 mixing , with special emphasis on the ozi - rule  violating parameters and the @xmath40 decays . in section [ tlregion ]",
    ", we comment on the reasons we believe justify the success of pas when applied to the tl region . in section [ tldata ] , we include the tl data in the analysis , present the new results and comment the improvements achieved .",
    "section [ mixing ] is devoted to the reassessment of the @xmath3-@xmath0 mixing parameters within a mixing scheme compatible with the large-@xmath4 chiral perturbation theory at next - to - leading order , with particular attention to the ozi - rule  violating parameters .",
    "the consequences of these results for the @xmath5 and @xmath41 radiative decays are also investigated . finally , in section [ conclusions ]",
    ", we conclude and mention the future prospects .",
    "within certain approximations , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proved the isovector contribution to the tff to be a stieltjes function , which is , that this contribution to the tff can be represented by an integral form defined as  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is any bounded and nondecreasing function  @xcite . by defining @xmath44 , identifying @xmath45 , and making the change of variables @xmath46 , eq .",
    "( [ stieltjes ] ) returns the once - subracted dispersive representation of the isovector contribution discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also exploited in refs .",
    "since im@xmath47  @xcite where @xmath48 , @xmath49 a linear polynomial with positive slope and @xmath50 the pion vector ff , then im@xmath51 is a positive function , the requirement of @xmath43 to be nondecreasing is fulfilled and the convergence of pas to the tff is guaranteed . is a stieltjes function , its @xmath52-subtracted version is a stieltjes function as well  @xcite . ]",
    "pad theory not only provides a convergence theorem for a sequence of pas to stieltjes functions , i.e. , @xmath53 , but also its rate of convergence  @xcite , given by the difference of two consecutive elements in the pa sequence . as we will see later",
    ", this error prescription will return very small theoretical uncertainties . to be more conservative , we designed in refs .",
    "@xcite a different method to extract such uncertainty which yields errors at the level of the statistical ones .",
    "still , even though the @xmath21 unitary cut driving the decay is of stieltjes nature , there is no _ a priori _ reason why the pa should work above the branch cut .",
    "the cumbersome situation is , however , that at least the @xmath54 sequence does work well above the cut ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) . and",
    "the unanswered question is , then , whether one could have anticipated this success and how general is for any arbitrary situation .",
    "a fair statement would be to say that , approximately , the tff is a meromorphic function which has nothing but a set of single and isolated poles within the data range . in this scenario , pa are an excellent approximation tool  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they tell us about the underlying physical phenomena driving the decay without the need to assume any model .    to better understand this situation from a qualitative point of view ,",
    "let us discuss the following .",
    "as we have said , in the zero - width approximation , the tff becomes a meromorphic function .",
    "if the tff contains a single and isolated pole , the @xmath54 sequence reproduces the pole of the tff with infinite precision .",
    "as soon as the width is again switched on , the @xmath55 threshold opens a branch cut responsible for that width .",
    "then , at first , no mathematical theorem will guarantee convergence on this scenario . on the contrary , if the convergence theorem is to be satisfied , one would expect the single pole of the @xmath54 to be located closer and closer to the threshold point as soon as @xmath56 , since this is the first singular point the pa is going to find .",
    "a closer inspection at the threshold expansion of the tff reveals a different pattern for real and imaginary parts in terms of the variable @xmath57 , the center - of - mass momentum in the @xmath21 rest frame . at low energies",
    ", one can model the @xmath58 tff as a convolution between the @xmath59 amplitude with the @xmath60 pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath55 branch cut at threshold has then , two different components , both of them well known .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath55 threshold for @xmath50 comes from the p - wave @xmath21 scattering amplitude ( the opened cut yields vector states ) together with the fermi - watson theorem that relates the phase of the scattering amplitude with the phase of the form factor below the first inelastic threshold .",
    "the @xmath21 p - wave scattering amplitude @xmath61 at threshold behaves like  @xcite : @xmath62&=&q^4\\sqrt{q^2}\\left(\\frac{a^2}{m_\\pi } + \\frac{4 a\\ , b\\ , m_\\pi^2 -a^2}{2 m_\\pi^3 } q^2 + { \\cal o}(q^2)^{3 } \\right)\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\textrm{re}[t^1_1(s)]&=&q^2 \\left(a + b\\ , q^2 + { \\cal o}(q^2)^2\\right)\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath63 , and where for the imaginary part we used the unitary relation im@xmath64=-\\sigma(s)$ ] .",
    "the absolute value of the threshold expansion of the amplitude @xmath61 is basically a polynomial in @xmath65 with the influence of its imaginary part starting only at @xmath66 .",
    "following the previous equation , if the threshold parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 are of order @xmath69 ( with the appropriate units )  @xcite , then the real part dominates near threshold and the absolute value is given basically by the real part .",
    "by virtue of the unitary relation for the @xmath50 , @xmath70 , and the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ t11exp ] ) , one concludes that while the real part of the threshold expansion of the @xmath50 starts at order @xmath71 , its imaginary part coming from @xmath72 $ ] only starts showing up at order @xmath73 .    in summary , since im[tff ] @xmath74 and @xmath50 at threshold is basically real , near the @xmath21 threshold the imaginary part of the tff , and thereby the expected discontinuity , will behave as @xmath75 , while its real part as @xmath76 .",
    "if this is the case and the offset of the threshold is that smooth , the @xmath54 sequence will be an excellent tool to reproduce the tff near and above the threshold .",
    "actually , taking the definition of a @xmath54 given by @xmath77 the polynomial part will reproduce the modulus of the @xmath21 discontinuity , and the pa pole part will account in an effective manner for the pole of the tff far away from the threshold .",
    "the last question is , then , up to what energy one can go above the threshold before failing .",
    "the threshold expansion itself must fail at some point because it breaks unitarity by powers of @xmath65 .",
    "a quantitative answer to this question would demand to study this problem using a particular model . to make a general statement , model independent , and qualitative",
    ", we notice that the threshold expansion should break down when the presence of the resonance pole is large enough and can not be approximated by a polynomial in @xmath65 .",
    "this happens basically at a distance of the pole given by the half - width rule  @xcite which , as argued in the introduction , provides a simple estimate of the pa range .",
    "the previous discussion already excludes the generalization of our results for any arbitrary stieltjes function since the clue feature is the behavior around the threshold point . while for vector and tensor form factors we foresee good performance of our pa method , for a scalar form factor with an abrupt threshold offset , the range of applicability within the time - like region will be more limited .",
    "parameterizations existent in literature which would be suitable to be compared our method with can be found in  @xcite .",
    ".low - energy parameters as obtained after a joint fit to both space- and time - like data with and without including the measured two - photon partial width as a restriction in the @xmath78 function of ( [ chi2 ] ) , second and third multicolumn , respectively . the leading coefficient of the tff asymptotic limit , the pole of the pa and the @xmath79 are also shown .

    "<S> the @xmath3-@xmath0 mixing is reassessed within a mixing scheme compatible with the large-@xmath4 chiral perturbation theory at next - to - leading order , with particular attention to the ozi - rule  violating parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 , @xmath6 decays are also considered and predictions reported . </S>"
