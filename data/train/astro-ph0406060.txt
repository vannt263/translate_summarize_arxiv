    "the additional mass near the lens contributes both a `` convergence '' ( additional gravitational focusing ) and `` shear '' ( gravitational tidal force ) to the lens potential , plus higher - order terms that may or may not be small ( see   [ sec : mockgrp ] ) .",
    "one set of systematic uncertainties in lens models occurs because the convergence is degenerate with the lens galaxy mass , in all lens observables but the time delays ; this is the well - known `` mass - sheet degeneracy '' @xcite . because of the degeneracy",
    ", the convergence is usually omitted from lens models , which leads to a variety of biases .",
    "attempts to correct the biases  for example , by using independent weak lensing analyses to constrain the convergence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  have been rare .",
    "a second set of systematic effects occurs because the shear is approximately degenerate with the ellipticity of the lens galaxy @xcite .",
    "two - image ( double ) lenses suffer badly : even when environmental effects are strong , models without shear fit the data just fine , and models that include shear reveal it to be degenerate with ellipticity . without independent knowledge of the environment ,",
    "the natural choice for doubles is to omit shear , but that must introduce errors into the models . the situation is better for four - image ( quad ) lenses , because the degeneracy between ellipticity and shear is only approximate .",

    "quads generally have enough constraints to detect the difference , and thus to reveal that shear can not be neglected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even so , models of quads may not uniquely constrain both the ellipticity and shear , leaving a large range of allowed models . furthermore , for both doubles and quads we must ask whether approximating the environmental effects as a simple shear ( neglecting higher - order terms in the lens potential ) is adequate .    these issues can be collected into a general question : _ if lens galaxy environments are poorly known , how wrong will standard lensing analyses be ? _",
    "we address the question by placing galaxies in simple but realistic environments whose properties we understand and control , and using them to generate catalogs of mock lenses .",
    "we then apply standard lensing analyses to the mock lenses , and study whether the results accurately recover the input parameters .",

    "we begin by examining a single ( but typical ) case to identify problems that arise when lens environments are unknown . in a subsequent analysis",
    "we will study in more detail how the errors depend on the properties of the environment .",
    "we stress that we focus on arcsecond - scale lens systems in which the lens potential is dominated by one galaxy ( or occasionally two or three galaxies in close proximity ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which are produced by the large dark matter halos of clusters .    in this paper",
    "we focus on systematic effects associated with the angular structure of the potential .",
    "there is an additional set of systematic effects associated with the fact that in models of many lenses the radial density profile of the lens galaxy is degenerate .",
    "we explicitly neglect this degeneracy by always assuming that the galaxies can be modeled as isothermal ellipsoids .",

    "we avoid any systematic errors associated with the radial profile , and highlight systematic effects associated with environment . in the follow - up analysis",

    "we first create a typical lens environment , a poor group of galaxies that mimics the group around the observed lens pg  1115 + 080 (   [ sec : mockgrp ] ) .",
    "we use the galaxies in the group to create a catalog of mock lenses (   [ sec : mocklens ] ) .",

    "this group appears to be typical of lens environments , and to be similar to x - ray selected groups in the nearby universe @xcite in terms of its galaxy population , kinematics , and x - ray properties @xcite .",
    "in addition , this lens is a favorite for many lensing applications ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , so it offers an insightful example .    the lens in pg  1115 + 080 consists of four images of a quasar at redshift @xmath12 around an early - type galaxy at redshift @xmath13 .",

    "we use the relative positions of these galaxies , together with the relative magnitudes given by @xcite .    in deciding how to distribute the mass within the group , it is useful to consider two extreme cases that bound the possibilities .",
    "one case places all of the mass in the group member galaxies and their individual dark matter halos ; this could represent a system where the galaxies have not interacted tidally with each other .",
    "the other case places all of the mass in a common dark matter halo , such that the galaxies are essentially massless tracers of the group potential . in nearby groups , the kinematics of group member galaxies and the presence of extended x - ray luminous halos suggest that the most of the mass is in a common group halo @xcite .",
    "the situation is less clear for the distant groups ( @xmath17 ) where lens galaxies are likely to be found .",
    "x - ray halos have been detected in two lensing groups at @xmath18 ( including pg  1115 + 080 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but studying them well enough to probe the group mass distributions is exceedingly difficult ( the x - ray halos are faint extended sources that have the bright quasar image superposed ) .",
    "theoretically , one might expect distant groups to be less dynamically evolved than nearby groups , and thus to have less mass in a common halo .",
    "given the uncertainties , we have analyzed both of these extreme cases .",
    "the systematic errors in lens models are qualitatively quite similar for the two cases , so we present only the case where all of the mass is in the galaxies and their individual dark matter halos .",
    "this choice makes it easier to discuss how observations of lens environments can be used to reduce or remove the model errors ( see   [ sec : fix ] ) .",
    "we model the galaxies as isothermal ellipsoids , which is consistent with evidence from strong lensing , stellar dynamics , and x - ray studies on small scales @xcite , and with galaxy - galaxy lensing and satellite kinematics on large scales @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assign all of the galaxies an ellipticity @xmath71 , which is typical for early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and we give them random orientations . the resulting parameters for the mock group galaxies are given in table  [ tab : grp ] .",
    "a visual sense of the group is given in figure  [ fig : kmap ] .",
    "note that the left panel shows the projected mass ( not light ) distribution , so it is perhaps more comparable to maps from @xmath72-body simulations than to images of observed groups .",
    "it is worth pointing out that even though we study a single global system ( the group ) , each galaxy has a unique local environment so we actually have 13 sample lens galaxy environments . as a further test of whether the group is reasonable , we can quantify the range of environmental contributions to the lens potential . for galaxy @xmath67 , the environmental piece of the potential",
    "is the part due to all the other galaxies : @xmath73 the lensed images tend to lie near a radius ( the einstein radius ) that is small compared with the typical distance between galaxies .",
    "therefore we might expand @xmath74 as a taylor series in polar coordinates centered on galaxy @xmath67 .",

    "equivalently , the convergence and shear can be expressed in terms of derivatives of the lens potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath79 even if the higher - order terms in eq .  ( [ eq : env ] ) are not negligible , the convergence and shear are still a useful way to quantify the environmental contribution to the lens potential .",
    "table  [ tab : grp ] lists the convergence and shear computed for each galaxy in the mock group , and figure  [ fig : gdist ] shows a histogram of the shears . for comparison , @xcite have computed the distribution of shears at the positions of early - type galaxies in @xmath72-body and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation .",
    "this distribution , which is also shown in figure  [ fig : gdist ] , represents the range of shears expected in standard galaxy formation models , and is also broadly consistent with the shears required to fit observed 4-image lenses ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; so it provides at least a rough guide to the shears felt by real lenses .",
    "although the sample size is small , the shear distribution for our mock group is remarkably similar to the distribution found by holder & schechter . ) that lies very close to , and is strongly perturbed by , galaxy # 3 .",
    "this galaxy has a small lensing cross section , so even if its shear is unusually large it contributes little to our analysis and does not affect our conclusions . ] while this test is by no means conclusive , it does suggest that our mock group is not way off base and is in fact quite compatible with the expected distribution of environmental contributions to lens potentials .",
    "while our mock group represents a single global system , the 13 member galaxies all have different _ local _ environments and therefore sample the range of environments that may be common to group galaxies .",
    "we have already made use of this fact in examining the distribution of shears and using it to argue that our group is reasonable .",
    "the next step is to sample the range of lens systems associated with these different environments .",
    "we do this by creating a catalog of mock lenses : we place many random sources behind the group , determine which are strongly lensed , and tabulate the positions , magnifications , and time delays of all the lensed images .",
    "we then employ the mock lens catalog to test the effects of environment in two ways .",
    "first , we imagine that we have observed the mock lenses , and we fit each one individually with standard mass models to constrain the lens galaxy properties ( mass , ellipticity , substructure , etc . ) and hubble constant @xmath8 .",
    "second , we use the statistics of the lens sample to constrain the cosmological constant @xmath7 and to study the relative numbers of quad and double lenses .",
    "the main question is whether or not standard lensing analyses , in which environment is unknown or poorly understood , yield accurate constraints on the various parameters . in essence , we are using a monte carlo approach to sample the errors in lensing analyses that are associated with group environments .",
    "the remainder of this section is devoted to the details of the monte carlo techniques",
    ".      in creating the mock lens catalog , solving the lens equation to find the images of a given source is straightforward using the algorithm and software by @xcite .",
    "the only subtleties relate to how the random background sources are selected . to sample lens properties realistically , we must account for `` magnification bias , '' or the fact that highly magnified lens systems are more readily discovered than less magnified systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if we want to mimic real samples , and in particular if we want to avoid undersampling quad lenses , when choosing sources we should give more weight to those with large magnifications",
    ". this amounts to applying a non - uniform probability density in the source plane , which has the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is 1 if a source at position @xmath82 is multiply - imaged and 0 otherwise , @xmath83 is the magnification of a source at that position , @xmath84 is the number of background sources brighter than flux @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the flux limit of a survey .",
    "if the luminosity function of sources has a power law form , @xmath87 , then the probability density simplifies to @xmath88 formally , we just draw from this probability density to generate the sample of sources , and then solve the lens equation to obtain the mock lens catalog .    in practice , the probability density eq .",
    "( [ eq : psrc2 ] ) is quite complicated ( because of the lensing caustics , for example ) , and there is no general algorithm for drawing from a complicated two - dimensional probability density .",
    "fortunately , a simplification is possible . in the special case @xmath89",
    "we can transform the probability density as follows : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is 1 if an image at position @xmath92 corresponds to a source that is multiply - imaged , and 0 otherwise .",
    "the first equality uses the fact that the total magnification is the sum of the magnifications for all the images , and the magnification of image @xmath67 is @xmath93 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the second equality uses the fact that @xmath94 is the jacobian of the transformation between the source and image planes .",
    "while the sum makes the middle expression look complicated , it just ensures that the probability density is carried into every part of the image plane , with no gaps or overlaps .",
    "the bottom line is that with @xmath89 , the magnification weighting in the source plane corresponds to _ uniform _ weighting in the image plane .",
    "therefore , what we can do is sample image positions uniformly within the multiply - imaged region of the image plane , and then map them back to the source plane to obtain a set of random sources with magnification weighting .    apart from ease of use , this transformation has one additional advantage and one small drawback .",
    "the drawback is that we have had to assume a source luminosity function of the form @xmath95 ; but this is not so different from the luminosity function of sources in the largest existing lens survey ( see   [ sec : mock2 ] ) .",
    "the practical goal of including magnification bias is to avoid undersampling quad lenses , and for this purpose the @xmath89 luminosity function is perfectly adequate .",
    "the fringe benefit of sampling uniformly on the sky is that each galaxy in the group is automatically weighted by its lensing cross section , so massive galaxies contribute the most to our sample of mock lenses just as they would in reality .    in creating the final catalog , choosing the source density represents a compromise between adequate sampling of the range of lens properties and the computational time required for the lens modeling .",
    "we find that a sampling density ( in the image plane ) of 40/@xmath96 yields a total of 2606 doubles and 1043 quads , which seems sufficiently large but still manageable .",
    "the number of mock lenses associated with each of the 13 galaxies is given in table  [ tab : grp ] .",
    "once we have created the mock lenses , we imagine observing them with the following measurement uncertainties : @xmath97 in the positions , which is typical of modern data ( from hubble space telescope images or radio interferometry , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; 10% uncertainties in the fluxes ; and time delay uncertainties of 2 days , which is somewhat better than much current data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but achievable with dedicated campaigns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mock lenses require that we specify the cosmology and the redshifts of the source and lens .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , and we use the lens redshift @xmath13 and source redshift @xmath12 to mimic pg  1115 + 080 .",
    "note , however , that these particular values only affect the time delays .",
    "the time delay between images @xmath67 and @xmath68 has the form : @xmath101 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term in square brackets is expressed in angular units , so the only physical scale ( and the only dependence on redshifts and cosmology ) appears in the factors out front . changing the redshifts or the cosmology would rescale all time delays in the same way , and",
    "would not affect our conclusions .",
    "once we have the mock lenses , we fit them using the two standard lens models that are usually applied when nothing is known about environment . when a new lens is discovered , the first thing people usually do is fit it with a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) . if the fit is poor , the common next step is to add an external shear  to model a possible environmental perturbation using just the @xmath78 term in eq .",

    "our goal is to identify the kinds of problems that arise from standard analyses when little or nothing is known about lens environments .      for studying the statistics of lens samples , it is useful to make two small modifications to the mock lens catalog",

    "conceptually , one takes a measurement of the optical depth , adds data or models for the mass function and a model for the cross section , and uses eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau2 ] ) to place constraints on the volume of the universe and hence @xmath7 .",
    "we first consider some of the basic quantities derived from models of individual lenses : the goodness of fit @xmath119 , the mass ellipticity @xmath120 , and the hubble parameter @xmath121 .",
    "figure  [ fig : d - eh ] shows histograms of these quantities for sie and sie+shear models of the mock double lenses in the catalog from   [ sec : mock1 ] .",
    "doubles provide just 7 observables : position and flux for each image , and the time delay .",
    "sie models have 7 parameters : @xmath22 , @xmath120 , and @xmath21 for the galaxy , position and flux for the source , and @xmath121 .",
    "sie models of doubles therefore have @xmath122 , and in general it is possible to find models that fit the data perfectly ( @xmath123 ) . unfortunately , there are large errors in the recovered mass ellipticity and hubble parameter caused by the neglect of environment .",
    "the problem is worse with sie+shear models ; even though environment is included ( in the shear approximation ) , it is completely unconstrained and so there are enormous uncertainties in the models . _ doubles suffer a fundamental problem : with so few constraints , lens models can not even detect an environmental component in the lens potential , much less constrain it well enough to yield accurate results . _    figure  [ fig : q - eh ] shows that the situation is better with quad lenses because the additional images provide more constraints .",
    "quads offer 15 observables : position and flux for each image , and three independent time delays .",
    "so both sie models ( 7 parameters ) and sie+shear models ( 9 parameters ) are well constrained .",
    "in fact , sie models generally give terrible fits : among our mock quads the median @xmath119 is 464 , and in 95% of the lenses the model can be ruled out at more than 99% confidence ( @xmath124 for @xmath125 ) . in other words , quads have enough constraints to make it obvious that environment can not be neglected . in this case",
    "the significant errors in @xmath120 and @xmath121 are irrelevant because the @xmath119 already reveals that the models are wrong . like real lenses @xcite ,",
    "our mock lenses indicate that quads can not be well fit by models that neglect environment .",
    "the sie+shear models of quads are more interesting .",
    "now the median @xmath119 among the mock quads is 19.3 , and in only 52% of the systems can the model be excluded at 99% confidence ( @xmath126 for @xmath127 ) . in the other 48% the sie+shear model provides an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "thus , approximating the environment as a shear is sufficient to provide a good fit to many quads .",
    "_ this approximation is not adequate , however , for recovering accurate values for the ellipticity and hubble parameter . _ the errors in these quantities , while smaller than for doubles , are still worrisome .    particularly troubling",
    "is the fact that the errors are not random but biased . for doubles ,",
    "sie models usually overestimate both @xmath120 and @xmath121 : the median recovered ellipticity is @xmath128 ; and @xmath129 of the mock doubles yield @xmath130 . for quads ,",
    "sie+shear models do reasonably well with ellipticity : 88% of the quads with acceptable fits ( and 74% of all quads ) have ellipticity errors @xmath131 . but",
    "@xmath121 is still a problem , as @xmath132 of the quads with acceptable fits yield @xmath130 .",
    "poor knowledge of environment can clearly cause not just uncertainties but also significant biases in lensing measurements of ellipticity and @xmath8 .    in the remainder of the paper we use the sie lens models for double lenses ( because they give perfect fits , and sie+shear models are underconstrained ) , and the sie+shear models for quads .",
    "it is often said that lensing robustly measures the mass of the lens galaxy within the einstein radius . to be precise",
    ", this statement applies to quad and einstein ring lenses , while for doubles lensing measures a mass  radius relation of the form @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the image radii and @xmath136 is the aperture mass ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "( quads and rings can actually be thought of in the same way , but with @xmath137 since all the images appear near the einstein radius . ) for simplicity we limit our discussion to the mass within the einstein radius as appropriate for quads and rings , keeping in mind that it would be modified slightly for doubles .",
    "an important caveat is that lensing measures only the total projected mass within the einstein radius .",
    "the total certainly includes contributions from the lens galaxy ( its stellar component and dark matter halo ) .",
    "but there is also a contribution of @xmath138 from the convergence .",
    "physically , this mass might represent a smooth background in which the galaxy is embedded , such as a common group dark matter halo ; or it might represent mass in the immediate foreground or background , such as the halos of other group member galaxies that overlap the line of sight .",
    "models that neglect convergence assume that all of the measured mass must come from the lens galaxy , and hence overestimate the galaxy mass .    to examine this effect",
    ", it is more instructive to quote the velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy ; while the mass depends strongly on the aperture and is not directly observable , the velocity dispersion depends only weakly on aperture ( not at all for isothermal models ) and is observable ( actually the velocity dispersion of the stars ; see below ) . for isothermal models ,",
    "the mass within the einstein radius is @xmath139 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : b ] ) , so the conversion is simple .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist - sig ] shows that the models do slightly overestimate the velocity dispersion , with a typical error of @xmath46% ( and a broad range , especially for doubles ) . while small , the errors are larger than the typical @xmath41% measurement uncertainties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they represent a systematic shift rather than random errors",
    ".    the errors may bear on a historic controversy in lensing analyses : the relation between the velocity dispersion of the dark matter ( the @xmath23 parameter in isothermal models ) and that of the stars .",
    "@xcite argued that the ratio should be @xmath140 if galaxy luminosity densities",
    "are @xmath141 power laws , but studies of more realistic models for the luminosity indicated that the _ central _ stellar velocity dispersion @xmath142 actually obeys @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "the difference may seem small in the velocity dispersion , but it looms large in lens statistics because the lensing optical depth scales as @xmath144 .",
    "most recently , @xcite have found @xmath145 by combining direct measurements of @xmath142 for five lens galaxies with model determinations of @xmath146 .",
    "we can not measure this ratio in our simulations since we do not include a stellar component .",
    "however , we can say that if standard models are overestimating @xmath146 then this effect could explain part but not all of the difference of the measured value from unity .      in some applications",
    "lensing is used as a natural telescope that provides high resolution for studying the structure of quasars and their host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    "accurate lens models are essential for `` de - lensing '' the system , or removing the effects of lensing magnification and distortion to infer the intrinsic properties of the source .",
    "in other applications the need to know the magnification and distortion is less obvious but no less important ( see   [ sec : substr ] ) .",
    "we consider how reliable lens models are for such applications , focusing on the magnifications of unresolved images since we use only point - like sources .",
    "when studying magnifications it is important to separate images of different types : images that lie at minima of the time delay surface and have positive parity , as opposed to images that lie at saddlepoints of the time delay surface and are parity - reversed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a double has one minimum and one saddlepoint , while a quad has two of each .",
    "the image type has become particularly important in studies of microlensing and millilensing ( see   [ sec : substr ] ) .",
    "if the lensed images are point - like then the parities can not be observed directly , but image parities can almost always be determined unambiguously with even simple lens models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    figures  [ fig : d - mu ] and [ fig : q - mu ] show histograms of the error in the lensing magnification , for doubles and quads respectively .",
    "_ we see that standard lens models tend to underestimate the magnifications , often by a factor of @xmath41.52 and sometimes much more . _",
    "the important qualitative point is that the errors are biased : the models almost always underestimate the magnifications .",
    "lensing offers unique constraints on small - scale structure in lens galaxies via the phenomena of microlensing by stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and millilensing by dark matter clumps ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the question is whether environment - related errors in lens models can affect the results .",
    "the millilensing constraints , in particular , are derived from lenses with `` flux ratio anomalies , '' or flux ratios that are inconsistent with smooth lens potentials .",
    "conceptually , the probability of having a flux ratio anomaly is given by the abundance of mass clumps times the cross section for any given clump to cause millilensing ( to significantly perturb the flux of an image ) .",
    "converting the abundance of flux ratio anomalies to a clump abundance therefore requires the ability to compute a clump s millilensing cross section .",
    "but that cross section depends in a complicated way on the total lens potential .",
    "the dependence is not apparent in the detailed simulations used by @xcite and @xcite to derive clump abundances , but it is made explicit in the analytic expressions derived by @xcite for the millilensing cross sections of clumps modeled as isothermal spheres .",
    "we focus on millilensing because there are as yet no simple expressions for microlensing cross sections .",
    "we compute the cross section for an isothermal clump to produce a 30% change in the flux of an image .",
    "figure  [ fig : q - sub ] shows the ratio of the cross section computed with an sie+shear lens model to the cross section computed with the true lens potential , for the mock quad lenses .",
    "studying the four types of images separately is important because saddlepoint images  especially the bright saddles  are believed to be particularly susceptible to perturbations ; this effect provides a unique signature of lensing by small - scale structure that allows it to be distinguished from other effects @xcite .",
    "there are indeed errors in the millilensing cross sections due to errors in the lens models .",
    "interestingly , the error distributions appear to be symmetric in @xmath147 .",
    "they tend to have relatively tight cores but broad wings , so the rms error in @xmath147 is 0.29 for the bright saddles , 0.31 for the faint saddles , 0.14 for the bright minima , and 0.09 for the faint minima .",
    "( we are considering only quads where the sie+shear model provides an acceptable fit . )",
    "the fact that bright saddlepoint images are so sensitive to the model errors is troubling because they are so important for millilensing analyses .",
    "one would naively expect that a @xmath430% uncertainty in the millilensing cross section might cause a comparable uncertainty in the inferred clump abundance , which would make this effect smaller than other statistical and systematic uncertainties in current results ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". however , to make that statement quantitative and precise we would need to replicate complete millilensing analyses ( following , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as for microlensing , without a simple way to compute perturbation cross sections we can only guess that there would be qualitatively similar results . clearly there is much more to do here ; we just want to point out that analyses of small - scale structure depend on the overall lens model , and errors in that model related to environment can not be ignored .",
    "we now switch gears and turn to statistical analyses of lens populations and the constraints they yield on the cosmological constant @xmath7 . as discussed in   [ sec : mock2 ] ( see eq .  [ eq : tau2 ] ) , lensing limits on @xmath7 depend on the optical depth @xmath106 , so the key question is whether environment causes errors in @xmath106 . first , though , it is useful to ask whether there are errors in the lensing cross section ( from which the optical depth is determined ) . to answer this question , we compare the biased cross section @xmath148 that a galaxy has when placed in its proper environment to the biased cross section @xmath149 the _ same _ galaxy would have if it were assumed to be isolated .",
    "any differences indicate that neglecting environment does cause errors in the cross section .",
    "figure  [ fig : csec - hist ] shows the errors in the form of a histogram of the ratio @xmath150 .",
    "_ models that neglect environment underestimate the cross section by tens of percent or more . _",
    "the underestimate is caused entirely by the magnification bias , ) . except in the rare case of naked cusps ,",
    "the unbiased cross section is simply the area enclosed by the radial caustic , so it is insensitive to convergence and shear . ] and arises because standard models underestimate the magnifications ( see   [ sec : mag ] ) .",
    "the next question is how errors in the cross section propagate into errors in @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lam - hist ] gives a sense of the effect , by showing the error in @xmath7 that would result from each of the cross section errors in figure  [ fig : csec - hist ] .",
    "_ underestimates in the cross sections lead directly to overestimates in @xmath7 , which can be quite large .",
    "_ this figure is a bit unfair , because constraints on @xmath7 properly depend on the optical depth , and not all galaxies contribute equally .",
    "for example , the point at @xmath151 ( corresponding to the point with @xmath152 in figure  [ fig : csec - hist ] ) is produced by galaxy # 5 , which is strongly perturbed by galaxy # 3 . however",
    ", galaxy # 5 has a small cross section and contributes little to any lens sample , so its properties are not very important .",
    "a better approach is to compute the optical depth by summing the cross sections , and then compare the `` model '' ( galaxies assumed to be isolated ) and true optical depths .",
    "this lead to an error @xmath153 , and hence an inferred value @xmath154 ( indicated by an arrow in figure  [ fig : lam - hist ] ) .",
    "this result holds if all lens galaxies lie in environments like our mock group , which is unlikely .",
    "the final effect of environment on lens statistics can not be determined because the distribution of lens galaxy environments is unknown .",
    "still , we can make a crude estimate .",
    "@xcite use galaxy demographics to predict that at least @xmath425% of lens galaxies lie in groups or clusters .",
    "if we conservatively assume that the fraction of lenses with groups is indeed 25% while the other 75% are isolated , we would find a cross section error @xmath155 and hence an inferred value @xmath156 ( also indicated in figure  [ fig : lam - hist ] ) .",
    "even this simple and conservative estimate points to the importance of measuring lens galaxy environments and understanding their effects on lens statistics .",
    "a long - standing puzzle in lens statistics is why so many lenses are quads rather than doubles @xcite . in the class statistical sample of 13 lenses ,",
    "7 are doubles and 5 are quads @xcite .",
    "( the remaining lens is a complicated system that has six images because there are three lens galaxies ; see @xcite . )",
    "the quad / double ratio depends on the relative cross sections for 4-image and 2-image lenses ( along with magnification bias ) , and it is thought to depend mainly on the ellipticity of lens galaxies . an observed quad / double ratio near unity",
    "is said to require a typical ellipticity @xmath157 that is much larger than observed or predicted for normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "in fact , some have spoken of the high observed ratio creating an `` ellipticity crisis '' in lensing ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "conventional wisdom holds that environment has little effect on the quad / double ratio , because ( when averaged over orientation ) shear does not significantly change the 2-image and 4-image cross sections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite recently showed that low - mass satellites around lens galaxies , which are common and not very sensitive to the larger environment , can roughly double the predicted quad / double ratio .",
    "we can now determine the effects of a larger group environment , using a model that is more realistic than simple shear .    under the standard assumption that galaxies are isolated",
    ", we would compute a quad / double ratio of 0.25 for each of our galaxies ( the same because they all have the same ellipticity ) .",
    "by contrast , placing the galaxies in their proper environments yields the quad / double ratios shown in figure  [ fig : quaddoub ] .",
    "we find that neglecting environment causes significant errors in the quad / double ratio .",
    "more relevant than the individual ratios is the net ratio after summing the 2-image and 4-image cross sections for all the galaxies ; this represents the ratio that would be expected for a real lens survey .",
    "the net quad / double ratio is again 0.25 when environment is ignored , but 0.50 when environment is included . _ in other words , neglecting environment causes a significant underestimate of the quad / double ratio . _    note that our predicted quad / double ratio of 0.50 is higher than the ratio @xmath158 in our mock lenses .",
    "part of the difference may be due to statistical fluctuations in the mock lens catalog , because some of the galaxies produce a small number of lenses ( see table  [ tab : grp ] ) .",
    "however , most of the difference arises from magnification bias .",
    "the mock lenses were generated using magnification bias corresponding to a source luminosity function @xmath87 with @xmath89 ( see   [ sec : mocklens ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the lens statistics calculations use a slightly steeper source luminosity function with @xmath159 ( as appropriate for comparison to class ) .",
    "the steeper luminosity function produces a larger magnification bias that increases the weight of quads relative to doubles .    even with environment included",
    "our predicted quad / double ratio is still somewhat smaller than observed .",
    "part of the explanation may be that we have assumed a particular ellipticity , @xmath160 .",
    "increasing the ellipticity to @xmath161 but holding everything else fixed would yield a quad / double ratio of 0.67 with environment included , which is close to the observed ratio .",
    "( with @xmath161 and environment omitted , the quad / double ratio would be 0.40 . ) a proper analysis would have to include an appropriate distribution of ellipticities .",
    "another part of the explanation may be that we have considered just one mock group , and the full distribution of lens environments will need to be taken into account .",
    "a third issue is that we have not considered low - mass satellite galaxies , which would further increase the quad / double ratio @xcite .",
    "still a fourth possibility is that the high observed quad / double ratio is a statistical fluke .",
    "thorough study of these possibilities is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we mainly want to point out that environment represents a systematic effect that can significantly increase the predicted quad / double ratio without violating other constraints ( c.f .",
    "having identified some of the environment - related problems in lensing analyses , we briefly consider what causes them and how they can be fixed .",
    "( a fuller treatment of these issues will be given in the follow - up paper . ) for doubles the situation is clear : with so few constraints , lens models are unable to recognize and constrain an environmental contribution to the lens potential ; to fix the errors , it will be necessary to study the environment separately and impose it on the lens models .    for quads ,",
    "lens models are often able to constrain shear from the environment , but the shear approximation clearly fails to capture all of the environmental effects . returning to eq .",
    "( [ eq : env ] ) , the question is whether the errors are caused mainly by neglect of the convergence term ( @xmath77 , representing the additional mass at the position of the lens galaxy ) , or by neglect of the higher - order terms . to address this question ,",
    "we consider what would happen if we somehow knew @xmath77 for each galaxy and could include it in the models . according to the mass - sheet degeneracy @xcite , the @xmath77 term simply rescales some of the model quantities without affecting the goodness of fit ; some of the key rescalings are : @xmath162 where @xmath23 is the inferred velocity dispersion while @xmath109 is the biased cross section , and @xmath163 is the power law index of the source number counts ( see   [ sec : mocklens ] ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : grp1 ] and [ fig : lam - hist2 ] show that this rescaling makes the model results much more accurate .",
    "in particular , it removes the _ biases _ in quantities such as the ellipticity , hubble parameter , lens galaxy velocity dispersion , image magnifications , and @xmath7 .",
    "there are still some random errors : 0.07 in @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; and 0.20 and 0.16 in @xmath164 ( for the bright saddle and bright minimum images , respectively ) . ) .",
    "] interestingly , adding the convergence does not fix the underestimated quad / double ratio , because it rescales the 2-image and 4-image cross sections in the same way leaving the ratio unchanged . _",
    "still , it appears that neglecting the convergence from the environment is the primary cause of the biases in lensing results for quads .",
    "_ whether the residual scatter is due to neglect of the higher - order terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : env ] ) or just to observational noise is not clear from this analysis .",
    "the problem is that the convergence is not directly observable , because it usually represents dark matter . nor is there a reliable way to estimate the convergence from properties of lens models .",
    "this statement may seem surprising , because for simple environments dominated by a single spherical halo there is a general relation between shear  which can be inferred from lens models , at least for quads  and convergence @xcite : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the offset between the lens galaxy and the environment halo , and @xmath167 is the mean convergence ( or surface mass density in units of the critical density for lensing ) in an aperture of radius @xmath166 centered on the environment halo . because of the average , @xmath77 and @xmath78 depend on radius and on the halo properties ( mass , concentration , etc . ) in different ways , and there is no universal relation between them .",
    "a second and more troubling problem is that the convergence is a scalar while the shear is a rank-2 traceless tensor ( or a headless vector with an amplitude and a direction that is invariant under @xmath168 rotations ; see eq .",
    "[ eq : env ] ) .",
    "this means that in an environment comprising multiple mass components , the convergence and shear from the different components sum in different ways , and attempts to relate the net convergence to the net shear break down .",
    "a final problem is that this could never work for doubles anyway , since there are no good model constraints on the shear .",
    "the only solution is to build a model that allows us to translate observable quantities into reliable inferences about the convergence .",
    "if we can identify and model all of the mass components in the lens environment , then the shear , convergence , and higher - order terms will all be included self - consistently .",
    "creating such a model is not as crazy as it may sound , because many of the key parameters are observable .",
    "for example , the relative positions of the group member galaxies can be measured , and the relative magnitudes can be used to derive the @xmath22 ratios ( recall the faber - jackson relation , eq .",
    "[ eq : brat ] ) .",
    "although the mass ellipticities can not be directly observed , we can hypothesize that they are not critical ; we can set them to zero when modeling the mock lenses and see whether we still obtain accurate model results .",
    "( to be precise , we let the main lens galaxy be elliptical but make all the _ other _ galaxies circular . ) in other words , all of the new parameters in the most basic _ realistic _ model of environment are either constrained by observations or fixed , so adding complexity has not caused an explosion of free parameters .",
    "we now consider whether such models are sufficient to fix the problems in lensing analyses . to allow for realistic noise in the observational constraints on the new parameters , we include generous uncertainties : measurement errors of @xmath169 in the relative positions ; and intrinsic scatter of 0.08  dex in the @xmath170 relation @xcite , or 0.16  dex in the model @xmath22 ratios .",
    "figure  [ fig : q - grp3 ] shows the results when we apply such models to quad lenses .",
    "there are no biases in the results , and the scatter is encouragingly small : just 0.02 in both @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; and 0.050.06 in @xmath164 .",
    "in other words , models that include the environment break the mass - sheet degeneracy and fix the problems with standard lensing analyses . furthermore , these models do notably better than the models in figures  [ fig : grp1 ] and [ fig : lam - hist2 ] that just included convergence , indicating that the higher - order terms in the lens potential from the environment ( eq .  [ eq : env ] ) are in fact significant .",
    "note that neither the assumption of circular group galaxies nor the inclusion of noise causes significant problems in the models .",
    "figure  [ fig : d - grp3 ] shows that similar results hold for doubles , with slightly larger scatter : 0.07 in @xmath120 ; 0.03 in @xmath121 ; and 0.08 in @xmath164 . while we saw in ",
    "[ sec : problems ] that doubles are largely useless for astrophysical measurements when environments are unknown , we see now that observing and modeling the environment makes doubles almost as valuable as quads .",
    "finally , figures  [ fig : lam - hist3 ] and [ fig : quaddoub2 ] show that @xmath7 and the quad / double ratio can also be recovered well from statistical models that account for environment .",
    "in this paper we have effectively studied 13 different galaxy / environment configurations , but they were all drawn from a single mock group of galaxies .",
    "we must therefore acknowledge the following caveats and questions about our results .",
    "_ is our mock group realistic ?",
    "_ we constructed the system to mimic the group around the observed 4-image lens pg  1115 + 080 , and to be similar to nearby x - ray luminous groups , so it has reasonable properties .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of lensing shears produced by the system is similar to what is measured and predicted for ( quad ) lenses ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the group s contribution to the lens potential seems realistic .",
    "however , the proper way to answer this question is to study more real groups around real lenses in detail .    _ is this group typical ?",
    "_ our group represents just one sample system .",
    "based on current knowledge of lens environments ( limited though it is ) and on the shear distribution , we believe that it captures features that are representative .",
    "but we must identify the full distribution of lens environments before we can say for sure .",
    "_ how do the results depend on the group properties ? _",
    "it seems likely that the systematic effects will scale with the mass or richness of the environment .",
    "however , that glib generalization obscures a lot of interesting details .",
    "a group s contribution to the lens potential may depend on many properties beyond its total mass : the ellipticities of the group member galaxies ( addressed briefly in this paper ) ; the properties of the galaxy population , such as the elliptical / spiral and dwarf / giant ratios ; the fraction of mass in the common halo versus that bound to the galaxies ( e.g. , the degree to which the galaxy halos have been truncated by tidal stripping ) ; the radial profile and angular structure of the common halo ; and the offset between the group centroid and the lens galaxy . in the limit that the environment is dominated by a common dark halo , we must also understand how well observables such as the group centroid and velocity dispersion will be able to constrain the important properties of the environment .",
    "studying these issues in detail is the subject of the follow - up paper .    much more detailed understanding of lens environments is clearly required .",
    "we need to characterize the distribution of lens environments in order to guide theoretical calculations . for lenses lying in groups ( or clusters )",
    ", we must find the member galaxies and measure the centroid and velocity dispersion of the system , and then build sophisticated lens models that finally treat environments properly . even for lenses that do not lie in groups or clusters ,",
    "careful observations will be needed in order to establish that the environments are unimportant .",
    "poor groups of galaxies around strong gravitational lens systems can affect lensing constraints on the masses and shapes of galaxy dark matter halos , the amount of substructure in dark matter halos , the quad / double ratio , the properties of lensed sources , the hubble constant , and the dark energy density .",
    "not knowing that a lens lies in a group can cause biases and uncertainties in lensing analyses .",
    "models of double lenses that neglect the environment will generally fit the data well ( @xmath171 ) but yield parameter values that are grossly incorrect .",
    "models of quad lenses will reveal that environment can not be ignored but will not fully constrain the environmental component of the lens potential .",
    "the standard shear approximation for quads is generally adequate for fitting the data , but not for recovering correct parameter values .",
    "the essential point is that the environment - related errors are not random errors but systematic biases , such as overestimates of lens galaxy velocity dispersions , the hubble constant , and @xmath7 , and underestimates of the image magnifications .",
    "these systematic effects help resolve one long - standing puzzle in lensing , but seem to aggravate two others .",
    "the solved problem is the high number of quad lenses relative to doubles ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown that neglecting environment can cause models to significantly underestimate the quad / double ratio ; accounting for environment can increase the ratio to near the observed value .",
    "the first unsolved problem involves lensing and the hubble constant .",
    "analyses of lens time delays that invoke what we think we know about galaxy dark matter halos yield @xmath172  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 , which is low compared with the conventional value @xmath173 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we find that poor knowledge of environments leads to an overestimate of @xmath7 , which would seem to worsen the problem .",
    "however , updated analyses have revised the lensing results upwards , with best - fit values in the range @xmath175@xmath176 @xcite . in this case , correcting for environment might even resolve any discrepancies that may remain between lensing and other methods .",

    "@xcite recently pointed out that if lens models can be made accurate at the @xmath41% level then strong lensing can probe the dark energy equation of state in a manner complementary to the other probes now being discussed ( such as supernovae , the microwave background , and weak lensing ) .",
    "we have argued that as long as lens environments are poorly understood there is no way for lensing to achieve this kind of accuracy .",

    "<S> it is suspected that many strong gravitational lens galaxies lie in poor groups or rich clusters of galaxies , which modify the lens potentials . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , little is actually known about the environments of most lenses , so environmental effects in lens models are often unconstrained and sometimes ignored . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such poor knowledge of environments introduces significant biases and uncertainties into a variety of lensing applications . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we create a mock poor group of 13 galaxies that resembles real groups , generate a sample of mock lenses associated with each member galaxy , and then analyze the lenses with standard techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we find that standard models of 2-image ( double ) lenses , which neglect environment , grossly overestimate both the ellipticity of the lens galaxy ( @xmath0 ) and the hubble constant ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> standard models of 4-image ( quad ) lenses , which approximate the environment as a tidal shear , recover the ellipticity reasonably well ( @xmath2 ) but overestimate the hubble constant ( @xmath3 ) , and have significant ( @xmath430% ) errors in the millilensing analyses used to constrain the amount of substructure in dark matter halos . for both doubles and quads , standard models slightly overestimate the velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy ( @xmath5 ) , and underestimate the magnifications of the images ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> standard analyses that use the statistics of lens populations to place limits on the dark energy overestimate @xmath7 ( by 0.050.14 ) , and underestimate the ratio of quads to doubles ( by a factor of 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic biases related to environment help explain some long - standing puzzles ( such as the high observed quad / double ratio ) , but aggravate others ( such as the low value of @xmath8 inferred from lensing ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of the biases are caused by neglect of the convergence ( gravitational focusing ) from the mass associated with the environment , but additional uncertainty is introduced by neglect of higher - order terms in the lens potential . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , we show that directly observing and modeling lens environments should make it possible to remove the biases and reduce the uncertainties </S>",
    "<S> . such sophisticated lensing analyses will require finding the other galaxies that are members of the lensing groups , and measuring the group centroids and velocity dispersions , but they should reduce systematic effects associated with environments to the few percent level . </S>"
