    "in the ` tuning fork ' galaxy classification scheme by @xcite lenticular galaxies occupied an intermediate position between ellipticals and spirals .",
    "they looked homogeneously red and smooth , as ellipticals , implying that they contained an old stellar population , and they had at least two large - scale structural components , centrally concentrated spheroids ( bulges ) and extended stellar disks , as spirals .",
    "hubble suggested that the morphological - type sequence might be an evolutionary sequence from the simplest shapes to more complex ones because his classification was ` almost identical with the path of development derived by jeans from purely theoretical investigations ' @xcite .",
    "later , the opposite evolution was supposed by the dominant cosmological paradigm : pure disks ",
    "late - type spirals ?  formed first , and later they merged into spheroids  bulges of early - type disk galaxies or elliptical galaxies .",
    "but in all schemes lenticulars remain secondary products of galaxy evolution .",
    "the most common opinion is presently that lenticular galaxies are former spirals which lost their gas and could not produce more young stars .",
    "the transformation of spirals into lenticulars is thought to be related to dense environments .",
    "indeed , within dense environments lenticulars are the dominant galaxy population @xcite ; whereas in the field the fraction of s0s is only about 15% , with spirals being the majority  @xcite . within the typical group environments the fractions of s0s and spirals are comparable , both about 40% -45%  @xcite , and in clusters the fraction of s0s may reach 60%  @xcite .",
    "the studies of galaxy morphologies with the hubble space telescope have shown , that the morphological - type balance within dense environments changes abruptly at the redshifts of 0.40.5 @xcite .",
    "the fraction of elliptical galaxies in clusters stays constant at @xmath620%-30%between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while spiral galaxies , constituting about 50% -70%  of all galaxies in high - redshift clusters , are replaced by lenticulars at the redshift of 0.4 @xcite . according to these results ,",
    "the exact place of s0 formation at @xmath9 was supposed to be clusters and the proposed mechanisms for this transformation were associated to dense environments via tidal effects and interaction with hot intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "however , recently some additional observational information was presented which gave evidence for equal presence of lenticulars and spirals in the clusters and in groups at redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite have found that at @xmath9 the fraction of s0s in groups is exactly the same as the fraction of s0s in clusters , and exceeds significantly the fraction of s0s in the field , so they have concluded that the group and subgroup environments were the main sites of the formation of s0 galaxies , and clusters at @xmath9 had then to accrete the groups together with their s0s .",
    "moreover @xcite have measured strong evolution of the s0 fraction in massive groups with galaxy velocity dispersions of @xmath11 km / s between @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "so the probable place of the proposed galaxy transformation has shifted now from cluster to groups .",
    "the information on galaxy morphologies at even higher redshifts , @xmath13 , implies another possible way of s0 formation .",
    "deep fields of the hubble space telescope have provided high - resolution images of high - redshift galaxies ; the statistics of the morphological types at @xmath13 demonstrate the absence of shapes typical for lower redshifts ( those of the ` tuning fork ' ) and the dominance of clumpy irregular types : chains , nests , ` head - tails ' , etc . @xcite .",
    "kinematical studies of gas motions within these chains and nests have shown that these are massive , of @xmath14 solar masses , gravitationally - bound disks where star formation proceeds in clumps with typical sizes of about 1 kpc and where the thickness of the disks matches just the clump sizes being 11.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "theoretical considerations confirm that gas - rich disks at @xmath15 are gravitationally unstable and should fragment into clumps with typical masses of @xmath16 solar mass @xcite .",
    "the observed timescales of star formation in these clumpy disks is much less than @xmath16 years  on average , @xmath17 years , according to @xcite .",
    "it means that at @xmath15 we expect fast formation of * thick * stellar disks via effective consumption of gas by star formation during a few @xmath18 years with subsequent feedback ( stellar winds of massive stars , supernova explosions ) which should clear the disks of remaining gas and would produce s0 galaxies which will be 10 - 12  gyr old at @xmath19 .    if the bulk of s0 galaxies were spirals at @xmath20 , or only 4  gyr ago according to the modern universe lcdm timescale , then star formation proceeded in their disks only 45  gyr ago . in that case",
    "their disks should now contain stars as young as 45  gyr and with the solar magnesium - to - iron ratio .",
    "stellar populations in cluster elliptical galaxies are much older than 4  gyr @xcite , and however the mean integrated colours of the nearby ellipticals and lenticulars are the same @xcite .",
    "@xcite explained this controversy with the aid of age - metallicity degeneracy : if the younger stellar population of s0s are also more metal - rich than the stellar populations of ellipticals , then the colours might be the same .",
    "the age - metallicity degeneracy problem can be solved to determine both metallicity and mean age of the stellar populations in s0 disks by using e.g. lick indices including h@xmath21 @xcite or by combining optical colours with the near infrared ( nir ) data @xcite .",
    "there were numerous attempts of doing so , but with controversial results .",
    "by combining the optical colours with the nir data @xcite found that the s0 disks are younger by 35  gyr than their centers ( which they called ` bulges ' ) , while @xcite did not detect any age difference between the bulges and the disks in their sample of s0s , and @xcite , among a few s0 galaxies , found 2 or 3 where the centers were prominently younger than the outer disks .",
    "the dominant positive age gradients along the radius up to several effective radii are found for a large sample of field s0 galaxies by @xcite from the grjh surface photometry .",
    "the similar photometric study of 53 s0 galaxies in the virgo cluster by @xcite has revealed zero mean age gradient along the radius and the very old centers of s0s ( @xmath22  gyr ) .",
    "the same scatter of conclusions is seen among the studies done by using spectral line indices .",
    "the early paper by @xcite where the centers of s0s were assumed to be old _ by definition _ , demonstrated bluer @xmath23-colours of the disks with respect to the mg@xmath24 metallicity sequence for old stellar populations , so the disks were concluded to be younger than the ` bulges ' .",
    "later , with the advent of lick indices and modern stellar population models , @xcite found the disks to be older than the centers in a few nearby s0s .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by @xcite and by @xcite for small samples of s0 fornax members , including dwarfs and giants , while @xcite , analysing data for coma cluster member galaxies , did not see any age difference between the centers and the outer parts of the galaxies in their sample .",
    "deep spectral observations of individual nearby s0 galaxies were also published : in ngc  3115 the disk is younger than the bulge ( 6  gyr * vs * 12  gyr ) @xcite , and in ngc  3384 the age trend is opposite @xcite .",
    "however , we would note that most of these studies probed the disk stellar populations at the radii of maximum 12 exponential scale lengths ; the photometric study by @xcite and the study of ngc  3115 are the only ones reaching outer disks of their s0s .    in the present work , we have measured variations of lick indices along the radius up to 24 exponential scale lengths in 15 nearby lenticular galaxies in different environments . by using photometric decomposition ,",
    "we have extracted the regions where the bulge or disk dominate , and have determined the mean ( light - weighted or ssp - equivalent ) ages , metallicities , and magnesium - to - iron abundance ratios for the bulges and for the stellar disks .",
    "these data are crucial to evaluate currently available scenarios of formation of s0 galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 presents our sample .",
    "section  3 describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "section  4 reviews the details of the photometric structures and gives our own photometric analysis of some moderately inclined galaxies of our sample .",
    "the central section  5 presents the age and abundance measurements in the bulges and in the large - scale disks of the galaxies under consideration .",
    "sections 6 and 7 contain the discussion and the conclusions respectively .",
    "the sample consists of nearby lenticular galaxies for which deep long - slit spectra have been obtained at the russian 6 m telescope during the last five years as a part of several observational programs .",
    "the main body of the sample is the set of edge - on lenticular galaxies selected for the kinematical study and dynamical modelling by natalia sotnikova and observed in the frame of her observational proposal ; the kinematical profiles for these galaxies are to be published later . for the purpose of the present work we have taken the raw spectral data and have derived lick - index profiles .",
    "four additional moderately inclined s0 galaxies come from our sample of nearby early - type disk galaxies  group members whose central parts have been studied earlier with the multi - pupil fiber spectrograph of the 6 m telescope ; the kinematical and lick - index data for the central parts of these galaxies have been partly published in @xcite .",

    "the correlation between [ mg / fe ] and @xmath73 is suggestive , with the spearman correlation coefficient of 0.6 ( less than 10%probability of no dependence ) .",
    "the correlation between the age and the disk thickness is formally insignificant , with the spearman correlation coefficient of about 0.35 , due to the thick disk of ngc  1184 which has an intermediate age ; but neverthless all the _ old _ disks of our sample galaxies are _ thick _ disks , while the only two young disks , those of ngc  4111 and ngc  7332 , are certainly _ thin _ disks .",
    "the disk of ngc  2732 , with its ssp - equivalent age of 8  gyr and the scale height of 0.5 kpc , is halfway between thin and thick disks .",
    "the range of the scale heights is from 0.3 kpc ( in the disks with the ages of 23  gyr and [ mg / fe]@xmath74 ) to 0.60.9 kpc ( mostly in the disks with the ages @xmath75  gyr and [ mg / fe]@xmath76 ) .",
    "let us compare it to our galaxy disks scale heights : 0.3 kpc for the thin stellar disk and about 1 kpc for the thick stellar disk @xcite .",
    "many arguments evidence for s0s and spiral galaxies being relatives ",
    "the most recent arguments in favour of the parallel morphological sequences of ss and s0s can be found , e.g. , in @xcite . but after taking into account our present results , it looks like s0s are progenitors of spirals , opposite to what was thought before . indeed , if we compare stars of the thick disk of our own galaxy with the thick stellar disks of s0s studied here we will see full resemblance : the ages @xmath77  gyr , [ mg / fe]@xmath78 , the total metallicity , which is closer to [ mg / h ] due to mg coupling with oxygen , both being @xmath69-elements , than to [ fe / h ] , [ z / h ] is between @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite . in other spiral",
    "galaxies thick stellar disks are also much older than the embedded thin disks @xcite .",
    "so if now one provides fresh cold gas accretion into the disks of our s0s , after several gyrs of star formation we would get typical spiral galaxies , with the thick old stellar disks and thin younger stellar disks .",
    "the idea by fuhrmann @xcite that primary large - scale components of all galaxies must be thick stellar disks plays here nicely .",
    "indeed , observations reveal that star formation in disk galaxies at @xmath81 proceeds in clumps with the sizes of about 1 - 1.5 kpc embedded into large - scale disks which are gravitationally bound ; and the scale heights of these disks correspond to the clump sizes so the gaseous disks at @xmath81 are thick @xcite .",
    "hence , the stellar disks forming from this gas in these galaxies should be also thick .",
    "the sph simulations of the secular evolution for such a configuration promise very effective ( and so brief ) star formation @xcite ; observations of starforming galaxies at @xmath15 confirm the short timescales of their star formation @xcite ; so after ceasing star formation the emerged passively evolving stellar structures would possess magnesium - overabundant stellar population .",
    "the first observations of the massive , disk - dominated , passive ( no star formation ) galaxy population at @xmath15 have already appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "initial simulations of the evolution of massive clumpy turbulent star - forming disks implied strong radial inflow of the clumps into the galactic centers , and so it seemed to be a way to form bulges of the future early - type disk galaxies : the resulting model bulges looked similar to the ` classical ' bulges , with large sersic indices and slow rotation @xcite",
    ". however later inclusion of the star formation feedback into the simulations has resulted in stopping strong gas radial inflows due to shorter lifetimes of the clumps ; and instead of the bulges , thick stellar disks emerge now from these simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude directly that intense star formation in high - redshift clumpy disks may produce the present thick disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "so now we are proposing the following new scenario of disk galaxy evolution .",
    "all disk galaxies were s0s immediately after their birth at @xmath15 . later , at @xmath82 , some of them were provided with cold gas accretion sources to form thin stellar disks  those might become spirals ,  and some of them failed to find such sources  these remained lenticulars . inside large cluster - size and group - size dark haloes , there are little chances to find external sources of cold gas accretion , due to surrounding hot intergalactic gas ,  so in nearby clusters the dominant disk - galaxy population is lenticulars . or",
    "perhaps , the tidal effects  harrassment resulting in starvation  are more effective in stripping the outer cold gas reservoirs of the disk galaxies preventing late building of thin disks ; this hypothesis is more in line with the smooth dependence of the s0 ( and s ) fraction on the local environment density over a full range of the latter parameter , from field to clusters @xcite .",
    "our scenario implies that the disks of spiral galaxies must be on average more massive ( and so more luminous , say , in the @xmath83-band ) than the disks of s0s ; indeed , we see such difference in fig .",
    "11 of the paper by @xcite where , at fixed bulge luminosity , the disks of spirals are more luminous than the disks of s0s .",
    "moreover , the bulges of early - type spirals are also on average slightly more luminous ( in the @xmath83-band ) than the bulges of s0s @xcite ; so we think that the bulge growth during thin disk formation is probably inavoidable . in general",
    ", our scenario explains long - standing problem with the s0s being fainter than e and sa galaxies between which they are positioned at the hubble s ` tuning fork ' @xcite . also , it explains why the tully - fisher relation of s0 galaxies goes in parallel to the tully - fisher relation for spirals , but with the 0.5 mag shift in the @xmath84-band toward fainter luminosities at the fixed rotation velocity @xcite : this shift is too small for the star formation truncation 45  gyr ago but , as the authors conclude , ` could therefore be explained by a systematic difference between the total mass distributions of s0s and spirals , in the sense that s0s need to be smaller ... than spirals ' .",
    "the open question remains what can be these sources of cold - gas prolonged accretion ",
    "they may be cosmologically motivated filaments @xcite or rich systems of irregular - type dwarf satellites which have been merging with the host galaxy one after another . to support the latter possibility",
    ", we would like to bring forward the recent curious finding by @xcite : by considering a sample of isolated host galaxies , they have found that the pairs ` s0@xmath85satellite ' have on average twice higher velocity dispersion ( los velocity differences ) than the pairs ` s@xmath85satellite ' .",
    "a close inspection of their figures reveals an absence of the ` s0@xmath85satellite ' pairs with the velocity differences less than 50 km / s .",
    "it might mean that the satellites of the present s0s have much less chances to merge with their host galaxies than the satellites of spirals .",
    "perhaps , among a primordial population of isolated s0s covering a full range of satellite velocity dispersions the host galaxies with the lower satellite velocity dispersions have become spirals , and only the host galaxies with the high satellite velocity dispersions preventing their numerous minor mergers remain still s0s .",
    "we have studied the stellar population properties along the radius up to several scale lengths of the disks in 15 s0 galaxies spread over a range of luminosities ( though all are more luminous than @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) and settling in different environments .    for the large - scale stellar disks of the galaxies ,",
    "we have found metallicities from the solar one down to [ z / h]@xmath0 , elevated magnesium - to - iron ratios , [ mg / fe]@xmath1 , and mostly old ages .",
    "nine of 15 galaxies have large - scale disks older than 10  gyr , which includes all the galaxies from the sample which reside in dense environments .",
    "the isolated and some loose - group galaxies have intermediate - age(7 - 8  gyr ) stellar disks , and only two galaxies , ngc  4111 and ngc  7332 , demonstrate the ssp - equivalent ages of their disks of 23  gyr . just these two young disks have appeared to be thin , and the other , old , disks have scale heights typical for thick stellar disks .",
    "we conclude that s0 galaxies are the primordial type of disk galaxies largely shaped by @xmath88 , especially those found in clusters today .",
    "some rejuvenation of the disks , but mostly of the bulges , is possible later for some , but not all , lenticular galaxies .",
    "the bulges are almost always coeval or are younger than the disks .",
    "spiral galaxies may form from lenticulars at @xmath89 by accreting external cold gas into their disks ; in dense environments cold gas deficiency exists so the most primordial lenticulars in dense environments remain s0s up to now being the dominant galaxy population in the galaxy clusters at @xmath19 .    despite apparent homogeneity of the s0 morphological type ( ` smooth red disk@xmath85bulge systems ... ' ) , the glance ` in depth ' reveals very large scatter of main structural and evolutionary properties even among lenticular galaxies of the same luminosity : s0s may be disk- or bulge - dominated galaxies @xcite , with exponential or de vaucouleurs-like surface brightness profiles of the bulges , and all the intermediate values of the sersic parameter @xmath90 can be met too @xcite ; and the stellar population of the bulges spans the full range of ages ",
    "@xcite , and also this paper .",
    "this diversity provokes a suggestion that s0 galaxies may be formed through different evolutionary channels ; and many theoretical suggestions provide a variety of possible physical mechanisms of s0 shaping ( see introduction ) .",
    "however , properties of stellar populations , especially in the outer parts of s0 galaxies less suffering from secular evolution ( influencing mainly the central parts of galaxies ) can restrict strongly the possible scenaria of s0 galaxy formation .",
    "namely , the old ages and high magnesium - to - iron ratios of the large - scale stellar disks of s0s exclude evidently their ( trans-)formation from spirals at intermediate redshifts , @xmath91 .",
    "we have now in hand some hints on the ages larger than 10 gyr in many large - scale disks of s0 galaxies , especially those populating dense environments : our sample studied in the present paper reveals a majority of old disks , but it is very small and spread over various environment types ; and also the recent results by @xcite for the virgo 53 s0s give the mean age of their ( inner and ) outer parts of @xmath92 gyr . if the tendency for the outer disks of s0s to be old is confirmed , all the scenaria which suggest spiral galaxy transformation into s0s in clusters and rich groups at intermediate redshifts would be disproved . what then remains ? only turbulent unstable starforming thick gaseous disks at @xmath93 @xcite which might leave thick quiescent stellar disks after a brief effective starforming epoch , and perhaps also gas - rich major mergers , if they occur at @xmath15 in future cluster environments @xcite ; and subsequent evolution with episodic rejuvenation according to our scenario proposed above .",
    "however , to make more certain conclusions , further investigations of the stellar population properties in the outer parts of lenticular galaxies are quite necessary .",

    "<S> by undertaking deep long - slit spectroscopy with the focal reducer scorpio of the russian 6 m telescope , we studied stellar population properties and their variation with radius in 15 nearby s0 galaxies sampling a wide range of luminosities and environments . for the large - scale stellar disks of s0s , we have measured ssp - equivalent metallicities ranging from the solar one down to [ z / h]@xmath0 , rather high magnesium - to - iron ratios , [ mg / fe]@xmath1 , and mostly old ssp - equivalent ages . </S>",
    "<S> nine of 15 ( 60%@xmath213% ) galaxies have large - scale stellar disks older than 10  gyr , and among those we find all the galaxies which reside in denser environments . </S>",
    "<S> the isolated galaxies may have intermediate - age stellar disks which are 7 - 9  gyr old . </S>",
    "<S> only two galaxies of our sample , ngc  4111 and ngc  7332 , reveal ssp - equivalent ages of their disks of 23  gyrs . just these two young disks appear to be thin , while the other , older disks have scale heights typical for thick stellar disks . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar populations in the bulges at radii of @xmath3 are on the contrary more metal - rich than the solar @xmath4 , with the ages homogeneously distributed between 2 and 15  gyr , being almost always younger than the disks . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that s0 galaxies could not form in groups at @xmath5 as is thought now ; a new scenario of the general evolution of disk galaxies is proposed instead .    </S>",
