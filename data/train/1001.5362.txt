    "@xmath4the distance @xmath5 is a function of two space - time points @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the distance @xmath0 as a function of two points contains much more information , than ten functions @xmath3 , which are functions of one point . to obtain the finite distance @xmath0 from the infinitesimal distance @xmath8 , a set of additional conditions ( and additional information ) is to be fulfilled .",
    "in particular , the obtained _ finite distance _ @xmath0 _ _  is to be a single - valued function of any two points of the space - time__. construction of the space - time geometry by methods of the riemannian geometry construction leads , in general , to a many - valued finite distance @xmath0 .",
    "this fact is a nonsense .",
    "besides , the riemannian geometry in itself appeared to be inconsistent r2005,r2006 .",
    "however , in the twentieth century nobody paid attention to this fact , because there were no alternative to the riemannian geometry .",
    "when this alternative appeared @xcite , the problem of the general relativity revision arose .",
    "let us stress , that it was just the problem of revision , but not a problem of a new gravitational theory construction , because the main idea of the general relativity ( geometrization of physics ) remains changeless .",
    "the problem of the general relativity revision contains two essential points    \\1 . a use of more effective and general mathematical method : the physical geometry , described completely by the finite space - time distance and only by it .",
    "\\2 . description of the relativity theory in terms , which are adequate to this theory .",
    "in fact , when the relativity theory came in the stead of the nonrelativistic physics , some terms and concepts of the nonrelativistic physics remained in the relativity theory .",
    "these concepts do not prevent one to solve concrete physical problems . however , they prevent from development of the relativity theory .  in particular , nonrelativistic concept of two events",
    "nearness prevents from the general relativity generalization @xcite .",
    "the present paper is written in the framework of the physics geometrization .",
    "the program of the physics geometrization is a generalization of the relativity theory on the case of non  riemannian space - time geometry .",
    "the general relativity ( theory of gravitation ) is created at the supposition , that the space - time geometry is a riemannian geometry . in the twentieth century",
    "the riemannian geometry was considered as the most general kind of geometry , which is available for the space - time description .",
    "however , it appears , that there exist non - riemannian geometries , which are more general in the sense , that the set of riemannian geometries is only a negligible part of the set of non - riemannian ( physical ) geometries .",
    "physical geometries are described completely by a finite space - time interval , but not by infinitesimal space - time interval as riemannian geometries .",
    "physical geometry is a constructive ( nonaxiomatizable ) geometry , which can not be deduced from axiomatics .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that a heavy sphere creates a deformation of the space - time in such a way , that the space - time geometry ceases to be a riemannian geometry .",
    "the fact is that , the metric tensor , given in the whole space - time , determines the space - time geometry only under condition that the space - time geometry is riemannian . in the twentieth century",
    "the riemannian geometry was considered as a most general space - time geometry .",
    "the condition , that the space - time geometry is a riemannian geometry , seemed to be very reasonable .",
    "the riemannian geometry is a mathematical geometry in the sense , that it is a logical construction , and all propositions of mathematical geometry are deduced from a system of axioms . the main property of a mathematical geometry is the fact , that any mathematical geometry is a logical construction .",
    "it is a secondary circumstance , whether or not the mathematical geometry describes mutual disposition of geometrical objects .",
    "there are such mathematical geometries ( for instance , symplectic geometry ) , which do not describe a disposition of geometrical objects .    on the contrary",
    ", any physical geometry is defined as a science on mutual disposition of geometrical objects in the space or in the space - time .",
    "it is a secondary circumstance , whether or not the physical geometry is a logical construction .",
    "the physical geometry is described completely by means of a distance @xmath9 between any two points @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the space , or of the space - time . in this sense",
    "the physical geometry is a distance geometry @xcite .",
    "physical geometry distinguishes from the distance ( metric ) geometry in the sense , that the distance geometry is not completely a metric geometry .",
    "for instance , in the distance geometry the concept of a curve is formulated not only in terms of a distance , whereas in physical geometry all geometrical concepts are formulated in terms of a distance @xmath0 and only in terms of distance .",
    "in fact the physical geometry is formulated in terms of the world function @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a use of world function is more effective from technical viewpoint .",
    "( for instance , the scalar product @xmath13 of vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a linear function of world functions of points @xmath16 , whereas in terms of the distance @xmath0 the scalar product is a more complicated expression",
    ".    in reality there exist nonaxiomaitzable space - time geometries , which can not be deduced from a system of axioms .",
    "riemannian geometries form a small subset of all possible physical space - time geometries , which are nonaxiomatizable , in general .",
    "different nonaxiomatizable space - time geometries may have the same metric tensor . as a result metric tensor",
    "does not determine the space - time geometry uniquely .",
    "besides , the riemannian geometry is inconsistent , in general .",
    "the riemannian geometry is considered as a kind of a mathematical geometry , i.e. it can be deduced from a system of axioms .",
    "these axioms are inconsistent at some points . as a result",
    "the riemannian have at least three well known defects .",
    "first , a parallel transport of a vector from the point @xmath17 to the point @xmath18 depends on the path of the transport .",
    "it means that there is no absolute parallelism in the riemannian geometry .",
    "second , from physical viewpoint the main characteristic of the space - time geometry is a distance @xmath9 between two space - time points @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this distance must be single - valued . however , in the riemannian geometry the distance @xmath9 is defined as the length of the geodesic , connecting points @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the riemannian geometry",
    "there are such points @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which my be connected by several geodesics of different length .",
    "it leads to multiformity of the distance @xmath9 .",
    "third , the euclidean geometry is a partial case of a riemannian geometry .",
    "let us construct euclidean geometry on a two - dimensional plane @xmath19 by means of the method of the riemannian geometry construction , i.e. we define the distance @xmath9 as a length of a geodesic ( the shortest line , connecting points @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "as far as in the case of euclidean geometry the geodesics are straight lines , one obtains in the cartesian coordinate system    @xmath20    let us cut a hole in the two - dimensional plane @xmath19.the geodesics , passing through the hole , become to be impossible , and the shortest lines pass around the hole .",
    "their lengths change , and the formula ( [ a1.1 ] ) ceases to be valid for some points . as a result the plane @xmath19 with a hole can not be embedded isometrically into the same plane @xmath19 without the hole .",
    "this result is a paradox , because , if experimentally one cuts a hole in a flat piece of tin - plate , the obtained piece with a hole can be embedded isometrically in the original piece of tin - plate .",
    "mathematicians know this paradoxical result , which means , that the conventional method of the riemannian geometry construction is inconsistent . however , they have no alternative to the conventional method of the riemannian geometry construction . as a result",
    "they prefer to consider riemannian geometries on convex sets of points .",
    "of course , such a restriction by the convex point sets does not solve the problem of the riemannian geometry inconsistency .",
    "this problem may be solved only by a change of the geometry construction method .",
    "deduction of the geometrical propositions from a system of basic axioms is a very laborious process .",
    "one needs to prove numerous theorems . besides",
    ", one should be sure that the basic axioms are compatible between themselves .",
    "a test of this compatibility is a very laborious process .",
    "for any new space - time geometry one needs to repeat this test of the geometry consistency",
    ".    however , the main problem of the mathematical geometries construction is a doubt , that any space - time geometry may be deduced from a finite system of basic axioms .",
    "indeed , any geometry is a continual set of geometrical propositions .",
    "it follows from no quarter , that a continual set of geometrical propositions can be deduced from a finite number of basic propositions by means of the formal logic .",
    "it is true , that euclid succeeded to deduce all propositions of the euclidean geometry from several axioms .",
    "however , it does not mean that such a deduction is possible for other geometries .",
    "in reality such a deduction is impossible for most of physical geometries , i.e. for geometries , which can be used for the space - time description @xcite .    for construction of physical geometries one should use the proper euclidean geometry itself ( but not the method of its construction ) .",
    "the proper euclidean geometry @xmath21 is a mathematical geometry and a physical geometry at the same time .",
    "it means , that the proper euclidean geometry @xmath21 can be deduced from a system of basic axioms , and all its propositions can be expressed in terms of the world function @xmath22 of the proper euclidean geometry @xmath21 . replacing @xmath22 in all propositions of the euclidean geometry @xmath21 by the world function @xmath23 of other physical geometry @xmath24 ,",
    "one obtains all propositions of the physical geometry @xmath24 .",
    "the procedure of the world function replacement is a change of distances between the points of the space ( or space - time ) .",
    "such a change is a deformation of the euclidean geometry .",
    "this method of a physical geometry construction is called the deformation principle @xcite .",
    "the deformation principle is very simple . it does not need a proof of numerous theorems and a test of the geometry consistency .",
    "( all theorems has been proved at the construction of the proper euclidean geometry ) . a use of the deformation principle for the physical geometry construction does not need an application of the formal logic .",
    "the deformation principle admits one to construct nonaxiomatizable geometries .",
    "most of physical geometries are nonaxiomaitzable , and they can not be constructed by the conventional method ( deduction of a geometry from axioms ) . in particular , the riemannian geometry ( @xmath23-riemannian one ) , constructed by means of the deformation principle , has not defects , which are characteristic for the riemannian geometry , constructed by the conventional method .",
    "there is a fern - parallelism in the @xmath23-riemannian geometry .",
    "the world function is single - valued . cutting a hole in the space - time ,",
    "one does not change the space - time geometry in the remaining part of the space - time .",
    "contemporary theory of gravitation as well as the contemporary cosmology are based on the supposition , that the space - time geometry is a riemannian geometry .",
    "however , generalization of the general relativity on the case of a physical space - time geometry shows that the deformation of the space - time geometry of minkowski generates a non - riemannian space - time geometry r2009 .",
    "the obtained generalization admits one to obtain the world function of the space - time geometry directly @xcite .",
    "in particular , the space - time geometry , generated by a heavy sphere is non - riemannian .",
    "the world function of a riemannian geometry satisfies the equation@xmath25the first approximation of the world function of the space - time , generated by the heavy sphere of mass @xmath26 has the form@xmath27where @xmath28 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the world function ( [ a1.3 ] ) does not satisfy equation ( [ a1.2 ] ) .",
    "it describes non - riemannian space - time geometry , although the metric tensor coincides with the metric tensor of newtonian approximation@xmath29note , that in riemannian geometry , constructed for the metric tensor ( a1.4 ) , the world function is many - valued , whereas the function of non - riemannian geometry is single - valued @xcite , as it follows from ( [ a1.3 ] ) .",
    "this fact tells in behalf of non - riemannian geometry .",
    "note , that a use of physical ( non - riemannian ) geometry is not a hypothesis , which should be tested by experiments .",
    "it is a logical necessity , because the riemannian geometry is incosistent .",
    "it means that contemporary theory of gravitation and cosmology need a revision .",
    "we do not state , that such a revision will lead to a change of our cosmological conceptions .",
    "however , such a change may take place .",
    "for instance , the concept of dark matter , made on the basis of unsatisfactory theory of gravitation may appear to be invalid .    in this paper",
    "we try to obtain the law of free particle motion in non - riemannian space - time geometry .",
    "this law has been formulated for microparticles , moving in the arbitrary space - time geometry @xcite . this law has been presented in invariant form ( in terms of the world function ) .",
    "now we present it in terms of differential equations ( in the conventional coordinate form ) .",
    "the state of a simple microparticle is described by its skeleton @xmath30 , which consists of two points @xmath31 .",
    "these two points form a vector @xmath32 , which describes the energy - momentum of the microparticle .",
    "the length @xmath33 of vector @xmath34 is the geometrical mass @xmath35 of the microparticle @xmath36where @xmath23 is the world function of space - time geometry . the geometrical mass @xmath35 is connected with the usual mass @xmath37 of the microparticle by means of relation@xmath38where @xmath39 is some universal constant .",
    "there are complex microparticles , whose skeleton @xmath40 consists of @xmath41 , @xmath42 space - time points .",
    "the world function of the space - time of minkowski has the form@xmath43@xmath44evolution of the microparticle in the space - time is described by a world chain @xmath45 of connected links @xmath46 }   \\label{a2.5}\\]]where any link @xmath47 } $ ] is a set of points @xmath48 , defined by the relation @xmath49 } = \\left\\ { r|\\sqrt{2\\sigma \\left ( p_{s},r\\right ) } + \\sqrt{2\\sigma \\left ( r , p_{s+1}\\right ) } = \\sqrt{2\\sigma \\left ( p_{s},p_{s+1}\\right ) } \\right\\ }   \\label{a2.6}\\ ] ]    the links @xmath50 of the world chain have the same length . according to ( [ a2.1 ] ) it means that they have the same mass . if the particle motion is free , the adjacent vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 are in parallel .",
    "it means that @xmath52where @xmath53 is the scalar product of vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "the same degeneration takes place in the case of the riemannian space - time geometry .",

    "macroparticles ( metorites , planets , stars ) consist of many microparticles , connected between themselves by some force fields .",
    "microparticles can not move independently and stochastically , because they are connected between themselves . as a result",
    "the motion of all microparticles inside the macroparticle is not free .",
    "it is described by a deterministic ( single - valued ) world chain .",
    "any such a deterministic world chain is determined as a mean chain , which is a result of averaging over the surface ( [ a2.26 ] ) .",
    "a result of this averaging of the surface ( [ a2.26 ] ) leads to the point @xmath125 , which together with the given point @xmath126 determines uniquely the next link @xmath127 .",
    "thus , to obtain a deterministic world chain of a macroparticle , one needs to produce an averaging of stochastic world chains of microparticles , which is equivalent to a statistical description .",
    "the obtained mean world chains are described by dynamic equations in finite difference , which depend on the geometrical mass @xmath35 of microparticles , constituting the macroparticle . to obtain differential dynamic equations",

    "multivariant physical space - time geometries are not considered in the contemporary theoretical physics .",
    "one believes , that the space - time geometry may not be nonaxiomatizable ( multivariant ) , because it is not known , how to construct such geometries ( the deformation principle is either unknown , or is not accepted ) .",
    "one does not admit , that a free motion of microparticles may be stochastic , and statistical averaging of these stochastic world chains is not considered .",
    "one believes , that the mean world lines of free macroparticles are geodesic lines of the space - time geometry . restoring the space - time geometry on the basis of these geodesic lines one obtains the riemannian geometry , which is determined by its geodesic lines and lengths of their segments .",
    "one ignores the fact , that there is an intermediate link between the world lines of free macroparticles and the space - time geometry .",
    "this intermediate link has a form of statistical averaging . as a result",
    "different physical geometries of space - time , having similar mean world lines of free macroparticles , are substituted by one ( riemannian ) geometry .",
    "such an approach is admissible , when one considers motion of free macroparticles in a fixed space - time geometry .",
    "however , this approach appear to be wrong , when a generation of the space - time geometry by the matter distribution is considered .",
