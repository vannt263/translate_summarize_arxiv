    "during the last years there was an enormous progress in the computation of physical observables at higher - orders . based on kln theorem , we know that virtual and real contributions must be put together to obtain finite results .",
    "however , both of them contain certain divergences originated in the loop or in the phase - space integration .",
    "for this reason , it is important to properly understand the singular behaviour of scattering amplitudes .    in this article",
    "we briefly explore the collinear regime of scattering amplitudes in the context of qcd@xmath0qed , and describe the computation of splitting functions in the triple collinear limit .",
    "these objects control the singular behaviour of scattering amplitudes when two or more particles become collinear  @xcite .",
    "when working in the time - like ( tl ) kinematical region , strict - collinear factorization  @xcite guarantees the universality of splitting functions and their independence of the non - collinear particles @xcite .    for the double collinear limit ,",
    "splitting functions were first introduced in ref .",
    "they have been computed at one - loop  @xcite and two - loop level  @xcite , both for amplitudes and squared matrix - elements .",
    "the multiple collinear limit has been studied since it is an essential ingredient of @xmath1lo hadronic computations .",
    "many tree - level multiple collinear splittings were computed @xcite , although higher - orders corrections are not fully known . at one - loop level",
    ", there were only some partial results for @xmath2 @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we gave a full description of triple - collinear splitting functions at one - loop level for processes which involve at least one photon .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : properties ] we establish the notation and describe catani s formula .",
    "besides that , we briefly describe the computational techniques applied to obtain the results . in section [ sec : photons ] we discuss the photon - started triple - collinear splitting functions , focusing in the polarized case .",
    "we make some comments on the structure of the results , specially about gauge invariance properties . after that , we describe the remaining splitting functions in section [ sec : qcdstarted ] and present the conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the most general configuration , let s consider an @xmath3-particle process where @xmath4 particles become collinear at the same time .",
    "momenta are labelled as @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the set of collinear particles .",
    "partons are considered massless , so @xmath7 .",
    "subenergies are defined as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "strict - collinear factorization is fulfilled in the tl region , i.e. @xmath10 for every @xmath11 , so we performed all the computations in this kinematical regime . also , it is suitable to use a sudakov - like parametrization to describe the collinear momenta . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the light - like vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 , so that ^ = p_1,m^ - n^ , [ ptilde ] corresponds to the collinear direction and @xmath14 describes how the collinear limit is approached , with @xmath15 .",
    "also , we define z_i =  , i c  , as the longitudinal momentum fractions , which fulfil @xmath16 .    besides kinematics , factorization properties become manifest when working in the _ light - cone gauge _ ( lcg ) @xcite . in spite of some technical difficulties , the ghosts decouple from the theory and the gluons only have physical polarizations . since the collinear limit involves the presence of almost on - shell virtual states , lcg guarantees that internal lines can be expressed in terms of physical particles .",
    "thus , keeping the most singular contribution when @xmath17 , we obtain & & _ a a_1  a_m(p_1 ,  , p_m ; ) + & &  , [ factorizacionlomultiple1 ] where @xmath18 is the splitting amplitude .",
    "when the parent parton is a vector particle @xmath19 , it is possible to remove its polarization vector @xmath20 and define amputated splitting amplitudes .",
    "the polarized splitting functions are obtained from the tensor product of two amputated splitting matrices , i.e. * * p**^_v a_1  a_m & & ( ) ^m-1 ( ^_v a_1  a_m)^ + & & ^_v a_1",

    "@xmath21 keeps all the spin information of the parent parton , thus it allows to have a complete description of the collinear limit . to obtain the unpolarized splitting",
    ", we just contract with @xmath22 and divide by the number of polarizations , _ v a_1 a_m & = & d_(,n ) * * p**^_v a_1  a_m , [ ecuaciondespolariza ] where @xmath23 and d_(,n ) & = & -_^d_st + , is the lcg gluon propagator in the context of dreg @xcite .",
    "notice that we use @xmath24 instead of the @xmath25-dimensional metric because we work in the cdr scheme @xcite .    in an analogous way",
    ", we can extend for fermion - started processes . instead of removing a polarization vector",
    ", we amputate the spinor @xmath26 and obtain an object with open fermion chains . in the @xmath25-dimensional theory , helicity conservation implies _",
    "q a_1  a_m(s , s ) & = & _ q _ s , s _ q a_1  a_m , [ fermionpolvsunp ] so we only require to compute the unpolarized splittings started by quarks . however , there is a subtlety related with the concept of _ helicity conservation _ in dreg . considering @xmath27 , there are contributions originated by helicity - violating interactions , so non - diagonal terms should be added to .",
    "however , after removing ir / uv poles , non - diagonal terms in spin space are proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "since we compute the @xmath29 corrections , these additional terms are neglected here .    working in the tl - region @xcite ,",
    "the polarized - splitting functions are rank-@xmath30 tensors that depend only on the collinear momenta ( i.e. @xmath31 with @xmath32 ) , the quantization vector @xmath13 and the @xmath33-dimensional metric .",
    "so , it is necessary to write all the possible tensorial structures and define a basis .",

    "here @xmath35 is a rearrangement of @xmath4 elements including the possibility of repeating them , while @xmath36 is just a permutation of @xmath4 elements .",
    "notice that for a generic @xmath4-collinear process there are @xmath37 elements in the tensorial basis .",
    "besides that , the first @xmath38 elements of the proposed basis are symmetric under the exchange @xmath39 , and the remaining are antisymmetric .",
    "since we are interested in the triple - collinear limit , we can adapt the previous basis for the case @xmath40 .",
    "so , we have @xmath41 and the splitting function is expanded as * * p**^_v a_1 a_2 a_3 & = & _ j=1^ a_j f_j^ . [ descomposition2 ] in the following , we will use the same notation applied in ref . @xcite . to obtain the coefficients @xmath42",

    "( m_sym m_asym)_ij , that is written as the direct product of a @xmath44 symmetric matrix ( @xmath45 ) times a @xmath46 antisymmetric one ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath48 , so @xmath45 becomes singular in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "this is expected since @xmath25 vectors in a @xmath50-dimensional vector space are always linearly dependent .    due to the fact that splitting functions are contracted with physical polarization vectors , only a subset of the tensorial structures @xmath51",

    "in other words , since @xmath52 , we can cancel @xmath13 and replace @xmath53 every time that @xmath54 corresponds to a polarization vector s index . in consequence , using cramer s rule ,",
    "only the relevant coefficients are extracted , which increases the computational performance .",

    "also , it is possible to express the insertion operator in terms of a @xmath67-number , i.e. @xmath68 because color algebra is closed when @xmath69 .    besides that , all the scheme dependence is also controlled by , up to @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , it is regulated by the coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are zero for cdr scheme .",
    "this property is very useful to simplify our expressions because we are interested in @xmath29 corrections to the nlo contributions to the splitting functions .",
    "so , working with @xmath60 up to @xmath29 , we get rid of any scheme dependence in the final result .",

    "thus , the corresponding polarized splitting functions are symmetric both under the exchange @xmath39 and @xmath75 . in consequence",

    "we end up with a list of master integrals ( mi ) multiplied by rational coefficients .",
    "so , we expand the result up to @xmath29 and verify that @xmath76 does not contain @xmath28-poles ( which constitutes another consistency - check ) .",

    "<S> in this article , we study the triple - collinear limit of scattering amplitudes , focusing the discussion in processes which include at least one photon . to deal with infrared divergences we applied dimensional regularization ( dreg ) and we worked in the time - like ( tl ) kinematical region in order to ensure the validity of strict - collinear factorization . </S>",
    "<S> both polarized and unpolarized splitting functions were obtained using independent codes , which allowed to implement a first cross - check among them . </S>",
    "<S> the divergent structure of all the triple - collinear splittings was compared with the catani s formula , and we found a complete agreement . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the polarized case , this comparison imposed additional constraints in the finite part of some master integrals ( mi ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of photon - started splittings led to very compact expressions , because of gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions were identified with the abelian terms of the remaining splitting functions , which constitutes another cross - check of the results .    </S>",
