    "classical multiway channels were already studied by shannon  @xcite .",
    "ahlswede  @xcite first determined the capacity region of the channel with @xmath0 senders and @xmath1 receivers , where all senders want to transmit independent messages , which all receivers should get . for a good overview on multiuser communication theory in general consult  @xcite , or the textbook  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we define the corresponding quantum channel ( after allahverdyan and saakian  @xcite ) , extending the definition of a classical  quantum channel ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "our motivation is twofold : in the first place , it is a very common situation that many users want to communicate via the same transmission system , and all real systems should be described by quantum mechanics . then , secondly , we feel that it helps understanding quantum communication if we try to solve questions known in a classical context for quantum channels .",
    "this the more , as for holevo s results on quantum channels ( coding theorem and information bound ) not only the question and its answer , but even the method of solution is rather close to classically well known mathematics ( see  @xcite ) , and we should find out whether this similarity extends further .",
    "the results of the present work are : we bound the capacity region , the actual bounds being obtainable from the classical case by formally replacing shannon entropy by von neumann entropy in the expressions , thus following a general principle or feeling in physics .",
    "the central result is a proof of the direct coding theorem for the multiple access channel ( one receiver : @xmath2 ) , using the technique of holevo  @xcite and schumacher / westmoreland  @xcite , which was designed to solve the single  sender case .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : channel ] the basic definitions are stated , in particular quantum multiway channels are formally introduced .",
    "section  [ sec : basics ] reviews notation and facts about quantum information quantities we shall need . in the following section  [ sec : upperbounds ] we prove the outer bounds for the capacity region .",
    "sections  [ sec : distortion : fidelity ] contains a central result on the state disturbance of a measurement with high success probability . in section  [ sec : directcoding ] this result is used to prove the direct coding theorem for the quantum multiple access channel . in the last section  [ sec : qq : dmc ] we comment on the quantum  quantum multiway channel which may be fed with arbitrary input states .",
    "the results of the present work are part of the author s ph.d .",
    "thesis  @xcite , mainly chapter iii ( with alternative proofs ) , and appendix a.",
    "this is the simplest situation of multi  user communication in general : consider @xmath0 independent senders , sender @xmath3 using a ( finite ) alphabet @xmath4 , say with an a priori probability distribution @xmath5 .",
    "this alphabet serves as a set of tags of different actions each user may take , such that a signal appears in the output system , composed of the effects of these @xmath0 independent choices , and the channel noise . to the output system the @xmath1 receivers have partial access , and their task is to each reconstruct the @xmath0 messages the senders chose to send .",
    "this is to be achieved by block  coding and via a previously agreed coding / decoding scheme .",
    "formally , this model is captured as follows : the channel is simply a map @xmath6 from the input alphabets into the set @xmath7 of states of the ( finite dimensional ) c@xmath8algebra @xmath9 , mapping the input @xmath10 to the output state @xmath11 . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that @xmath12 is the full operator algebra of the finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath13 , and we shall assume that the @xmath11 are density operators on @xmath13",
    ". are uniquely described by density operators _ inside _ @xmath9 . ]    however , to express the theory in this algebraic manner has its merits , as we shall see :    the output state ( generally mixed ) is accessed by several receicers .",
    "these are represented by _ commuting _",
    "@xmath14subalgebras @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) of @xmath9 : the meaning is that receiver @xmath17 may use any measurement ( povm ) whose elements belong to @xmath15 .",
    "the commutativity ensures that these measurements can be performed together .",
    "the typical case of this situation is that @xmath18 , where we identify @xmath15 with the subalgebra @xmath19 of @xmath9 . by linear extension",
    "we may view @xmath20 as a completely positive , trace preserving map from @xmath21 to @xmath9 , where @xmath22 is the commutative algebra of @xmath23valued functions on @xmath4 , whose elements we identify with their indicator functions . if all the @xmath24 commute with each other ( hence have a common diagonalization ) the channel is called _ quasi  classical _ , and _ classical _ if @xmath9 is a commutative algebra .",
    "it should be stressed that all this can be embedded into standard quantum theory by identifying all algebras in question with operator algebras in some sufficiently large hilbert space , e.g. a commutative algebra with a set of diagonal matrices . to get more familiar with this formalism",
    "the reader might consult a book like  @xcite .    for fixed a priori distributions define the _ channel state _",
    "@xmath25 on @xmath26 .",
    "this serves as the quantum analogue of the joint distribution of the random variables representing input and output letters in the classical case .",
    "it may be interpreted as the joint state of the system after the channel usage , where the senders kept a record of their individual letters ( this is possible because they input classical information , reflected in the classical nature of their systems ) .",
    "note the 11correspondence between states @xmath27 on @xmath26 and pairs @xmath28 of channels @xmath20 and probability distributions @xmath29 on @xmath30 .",
    "this is a feature of our model , which relies on the commutativity of the @xmath31 ( compare  @xcite for the difficulties encountered in more general situations ) .",
    "we will employ block coding on the discrete memoryless channel generated by @xmath20 : for sequences @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the @xmath34block channel @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 we now introduce some notation to describe the channel as seen by a subset of senders , while the others enter only stochastically :    for a @xmath37=\\{1,\\ldots , s\\}$ ] denote @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( similarly @xmath41 ) .",
    "define the _ reduced channel _ @xmath42 by @xmath43 ( here @xmath44 denotes the complement @xmath45\\setminus j$ ] of @xmath46 in @xmath45 $ ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath47 transmission is now by using codes on @xmath34blocks :    an @xmath34_block  code _ is a collection @xmath48 of maps @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the set of messages of sender @xmath3 ) and decoding observables ( povms ) @xmath51 , indexed by @xmath52 , i.e. : @xmath53 such that @xmath54 there are @xmath1 ( average ) _ error probabilities _ of the code , the probability that the receiver @xmath17 guesses incorrectly any one of the sent words , taken over the uniform distribution on the message sets : @xmath55 we call @xmath48 an @xmath56code if all error probabilities @xmath57 do not exceed @xmath58 .",
    "the _ rates _ of the code are the @xmath59 .",
    "a tuple @xmath60 is said to be _ achievable _ , if for any @xmath61 there exists for any large enough @xmath34 an @xmath56code with @xmath3th rate at least @xmath62 .",
    "the set of all achievable tuples ( which is clearly closed ) is called the _ capacity region _ of the channel , and to determine this region is the problem to be addressed here .",
    "some observations should be made : first , the capacity region is _ convex _ , by the _ time sharing principle _ :",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath63 be rate tuples of @xmath64 and @xmath34block codes , respectively , with error probability @xmath58 each . by concatenating the codewords to @xmath65blocks , and tensoring the corresponding decoding observables , we get an @xmath65block code with error probability at most @xmath66 , and with rates @xmath67 .",
    "second , note that in the multi  user situation not a single number describes the performance of the channel ( as with capacity in the single  sender case ) . instead ,",
    "only with given behaviour of the other senders the channel gets a specific capacity for a particular sender .",
    "intuitively , this is because the others ( unknown ! ) actions may be seen as additional noise ( a phenomenon known as `` interference '' in classical multi  user channels ) .",
    "in this section we introduce some notation in which we express our results . from  @xcite , appendix a , we use the definitions of various information quantities for observables and @xmath14subalgebras , which we review for the sake of self  containedness :    let @xmath68 be a c@xmath8algebra , and @xmath69 a state on it . for a @xmath14subalgebra @xmath70",
    "we want to define the _ entropy of @xmath69 with respect to this subalgebra _ ( we shall stress the dependence on @xmath70 , as @xmath69 is supposed to be fixed ) . to this end",
    "let us consider the restriction @xmath71 of @xmath69 to @xmath70 , and define @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the unique _ trace _ on @xmath70 ( i.e. a positive @xmath23linear functional on @xmath70 , with the properties @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) , that assigns @xmath76 to all minimal idempotents of @xmath70 .",
    "an important example is the usual trace of @xmath77 , in which case the formula gives the familiar von neumann entropy of the state .",
    "motivated by identities for classical shannon entropy we may now define , for ( elementwise ) commuting @xmath14subalgebras @xmath70 and @xmath78 : the conditional entropy @xmath79 and the mutual information @xmath80 the condition that the algebras commute is crucial here : it ensures that all observables in @xmath70 are coexistent with all observables in @xmath78 , and also , that the product @xmath81 is indeed the algebra generated by @xmath70 and @xmath78 .",
    "of course , these definitions are only formally derived from well known classical formulas , and there is no reason to expect that they are meaningful ( which indeed they are only to a limited degree : see the discussions in  @xcite , and in  @xcite ) .",
    "anyhow , for our purposes they make sufficient sense .",
    "if @xmath82 is a third @xmath14subalgebra , commuting with both @xmath70 and @xmath78 , we may finally define the conditional mutual information @xmath83 we note , that the conditional mutual information is positive , by the strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy ( see  @xcite , theorem  a.9 ) .",
    "in all the above expressions we supressed the dependence on the underlying state @xmath69 . in cases of possible ambiguity",
    "it is added as a subscript .    with these definitions we have the ( easily checked ) identities for the system introduced in section  [ sec : channel ] , with the channel state @xmath27 : @xmath84 } ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where in the last line an alternative notation is used :    for a channel @xmath85 and a probability distribution @xmath86 on @xmath87 let @xmath88 with the von neumann entropy @xmath89 : so this is the familiar writing of a conditional as an average of entropies .",
    "there are a number of important relations between all these quantities , of which we shall make use of two :    [ lemma : subadd ] let @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) be two channels , and @xmath86 a probability distribution on @xmath92 . forming the channel state @xmath93 we have the following subadditivity relation : @xmath94    this is well known for classical channels , and the proof in our case runs exactly the same .",
