    "@xmath1 of @xmath2 is the spin - partner of @xmath3 in the charmomium family , however , it seems to @xmath4 behaves very differently from other family members . searching for @xmath4 , as well as @xmath5",
    "is a challenging task for both experimentalists and theorists of high energy physics @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 was first seen at the cern intersecting storage rings ( isr ) @xcite , and later the e760 group at fermilab reported observation of @xmath1 by studying the @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , the e835 group claimed that they did not see @xmath1 in this channel .",
    "instead , e835 reported observation of @xmath1 in another channel @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently , the babar collaboration set an upper bound for the production rate of @xmath4 as @xmath8 for @xmath9 at @xmath10 c.l .",
    "by contrast , the belle collaboration reported null result on searching for @xmath4 via @xmath11 and gave an upper bound on the branching ratio as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the cleo collaboration has announced observation of @xmath1 in the decay @xmath13 with a very small branching ratio @xcite . as a comparison ,",
    "so far , the bes ii collaboration has not seen @xmath4 yet , and searching for it may be an important issue for the upgraded stage bes iii .",
    "one needs to understand the experimental status about the production rate of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , a relatively larger production rate may be associated to new physics @xcite , therefore study on @xmath4 production may provide a chance to investigate effects of new physics , such as supersymmetry at lower energy scales . of course , before invoking for new physics",
    ", one needs to more accurately estimate the production rate of @xmath4 in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "suzuki suggested to look for @xmath1 at @xmath14 and if approximately @xmath15 , he estimated the cascade branching ratio as @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "gu considered another decay chain and estimated the branching ratio @xmath17 as @xmath18@xcite .    in the decay of b - meson into charmonium",
    "is the so - called internal emission process where due to the color matching the process is suppressed compared to the external emission .",
    "moreover , the non - factorizable effects would further change the contribution of the internal process besides a color factor of 1/3 @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems that the smallness of @xmath19 is natural .",
    "however , one could not reproduce experimental value of the @xmath20 decay rate @xcite in the qcd improved factorization , so that the authors of @xcite suggested to consider re - scattering effects in b meson decay .",
    "they claimed that @xcite a larger branching ratio for @xmath21 which is consistent with data , was obtained .",
    "motivated by the same idea , they applied the same scenario to investigate the re - scattering effects for @xmath22 case , i.e. supposing that the decay @xmath23 occurs via the the subsequent re - scattering effect of @xmath24 , the products of decay @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "they obtained a branching ratio ( @xmath26 ) which is much larger than the upper bound set by the belle collaboration .",
    "it is very possible that the branching ratio of @xmath22 was overestimated in their work due to uncontrollable theoretical uncertainties , such as some input parameters and basic assumptions adopted in their calculation , which were comprehensively discussed in their paper .    even though we may suppose that we have full knowledge on the weak and strong interactions at the quark level and can derive the quark - transition amplitude , the most difficult part is evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements of the exclusive processes .",
    "in fact , at present , a complete calculation of @xmath11 based on an underlying theoretical framework is absent .",
    "the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach is believed to be successful for estimating transition rates of b and d into light mesons @xcite , even though there is still dispute about its applicability @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite applied the pqcd approach to study @xmath27 and also obtained results which satisfactory comply with data .",
    "therefore we have reason to believe that it is appropriate to analyze @xmath28 in this framework . in this work ,",
    "we calculate decay rate of @xmath29 in the pqcd .    generally , for two - body non - leptonic decays of b meson , both factorizable and non - factorizable diagrams contribute to the transition amplitudes , however , for @xmath29 , the contributions from factorizable diagrams disappear since the conservation of g parity leads to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the decay rate of @xmath28 is much different from that in @xmath31 @xcite where both factorizable and non - factorizable diagrams contribute .    to be more precise than the qualitative understanding",
    ", one needs to calculate the non - factorizable contribution where the qcd effects are accounted .",
    "moreover , since the process is not factorizable , the convolution integral would involve the initial b - meson and all the two produced mesons altogether .",
    "our numerical results indeed indicate that the order of magnitude of @xmath22 should be of order of @xmath32 , which is smaller than the upper bound set by the babar collaboration @xcite and slightly below the upper bound given by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "it is noticed that our result about @xmath33 is smaller than that estimated by the authors of @xcite and more consistent with data .",
    "indeed , more decisive conclusion should be made as more accurate data are accumulated by bes iii , cleo , babar , belle and even the lhcb .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , we formulate the decay amplitude of @xmath23 in the pqcd approach",
    ". then we present our numerical results along with all the input parameters in sect .",
    "iii . the last section is devoted to our conclusion and discussion .",
    "some tedious expressions are collected in the appendix .",
    "the quark - diagrams which contribute to the transition amplitude of @xmath34 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ hard ] . as has been discussed in the introduction , the factorized diagrams fig .",
    "[ hard ] ( a),(b ) do not contribute to the amplitude because the the g parities of axial meson @xmath1 and axial current are mismatched and in the flavor su(3 ) symmetry limit , the corresponding hadronic matrix element is forbidden@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the effective hamiltonian relevant to @xmath29 decay in the sm is written as @xcite @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are the wilson coefficients and @xmath37 are the relevant operators defined as @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the color indices . the explicit expressions of the wilson coefficients appearing in the above equations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we define , in the rest frame of the b meson , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 to be the four - moneta of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath1 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 to be the momenta of the valence quarks inside b(@xmath49 ) , @xmath45 ( @xmath50 ) , and @xmath1 ( @xmath51 ) , respectively .",
    "then we parameterize the light cone momenta with all the light quarks and mesons being treated as massless @xmath52 where the mass ratio @xmath53 is set as @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are the fractions of the longitudinal momenta of the valence quarks .",
    "the superscripts `` @xmath57 '' ( plus ) and `` @xmath58 '' ( minus ) mean that the three - momentum is parallel or anti - parallel to the positive @xmath59 direction which is defined as the direction of the three - momentum of the produced @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the transverse momenta of the valence quarks inside b , @xmath45 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the calculations of the non - factorizable diagrams fig . [ hard ] ( c),(d ) . then we divide the operators appearing in the effective hamiltonian into two categories according to their chirality , i.e. @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    for the type of @xmath65 , the hard kernels of fig .",

    "( [ hard - c ] ) comes from the fierz transformation on the @xmath64 operators .    similarly , for fig .",

    "finally , for each type of operators we obtain the decay amplitude @xmath69 which is a sum of the two non - factorizable diagrams . for saving the space ,",
    "we collect them in appendix a. the wave functions relevant to calculation is given in appendix b.    the decay width of @xmath29 is written as @xmath70 with the total amplitude is the sum of @xmath71 as @xmath72 @xmath73 denotes the three - momentum of the produced meson in the center - of - mass frame of b meson .",
    "all the explicit expressions of @xmath74 are collected in appendix a in order to shorten the text and focus on the physics contents .",
    "the input parameters used in the text are given below : @xmath75 gev , @xmath76 gev @xcite .",
    "@xmath77 gev @xcite . for the ckm mixing parameters ,",
    "we take @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the parameters appeared in the wave functions are put in the appendix b following the corresponding wavefunctions .    using the above parameters , finally one obtains the branching ratio of @xmath29 ( in the numerical calculation , we take the central values listed in the data book for the input parameters ) @xmath82    since all the parameters adopted in our numerical computations are included in the wavefunctions of the concerned hadrons and the sudakov factor which are obtained by fitting data of some well measured processes , thus the error of our final result is due to the uncertainties in such fitting .",
    "because of the uncontrollable factors , one can not expect to get very accurate value at the present stage .",
    "therefore , we only keep two significant figures without explicitly marking out the error range .",
    "but in the last section for discussion , we will present a rough error estimate which may make sense .",
    "there are some theoretical uncertainties in our calculations .",
    "one of them comes from the next to leading order corrections to the hard amplitudes@xcite . in view of this point",
    ", we check the sensitivity of the decay rate with different choices of hard scales , i.e. we set the hard scales as @xmath83 and other parameters are fixed .",
    "then we can obtain the branching ratio of @xmath29 and the error may be a few percents and the whole result is not sensitive to the change of hard scales .",
    "another uncertainty comes from the non - perturbative parameters in meson wavefunctions , such as @xmath84 in @xmath44 meson wavefunctions , although they are determined directly from previous experiments or some non - perturbative methods like qcd sum rules . here",
    "we vary the value of @xmath84 at the range @xmath85 gev , with other parameters fixed , as ref .",
    "@xcite did , then we find that the errors can be as large as 20% .",
    "it can be observed that the decay rate is relatively more dependent on the value of @xmath84 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author proposed that @xmath86 is a promising mode to look for @xmath4 and presented a theoretical estimation on the branching ratio as @xmath87 . combining this branching ratio with @xmath88",
    ", one could predict the branching ratio of the decay chain @xmath89 as @xmath90",
    "in this work , we employ the framework of pqcd approach to calculate the transition rate of @xmath29 and predict the branching ratio to be about @xmath91 .",
    "it is observed that only non - factorizable diagrams contribute to the decay amplitude , because this transition is a g - parity violation process .",
    "so one can expect it to be relatively suppressed compared with @xmath92 which is about @xmath93 @xcite . in our work , we estimate the ratio and obtain results which are reasonably consistent with data . in this way , we not only naturally reproduce the production rate of @xmath4 at babar and belle , but also have a chance to study the non - factorizable diagrams .",
    "usually , in most processes , both factorizable and non - factorizable diagrams contribute and it is hard to separate their contributions .",
    "thus when comparing with data , there is an obvious uncertainty .",
    "however , this case is an optimistic place where only non - factorizable diagrams contribute .",
    "it enables us to uniquely investigate the non - factorizable contributions to the weak transitions and testify applicability of the theory , pqcd .",
    "our prediction is consistent with the upper bound reported by the belle and babar collaborations @xcite at the level of order of magnitude .",
    "thus we can conclude that the pqcd is applicable to the process , especially to deal with the non - factorizable diagrams .",
    "in fact , all these phenomenological parameters in the wavefunctions of @xmath94 are priori determined and the choice of the factorization scale follows the conventional way . in our numerical computations",
    ", we do not introduce any free parameter to adjust .",
    "therefore the error of the final result obtained in this work is due to the uncertainties included in the wavefunctions of the concerned hadrons and the sudakov factors which are expressed in terms of a few phenomenological parameters .",
    "as the input parameters which exist in the wavefunctions of the concerned hadrons , vary within a reasonable range , an error of about 20% is expected . on other aspect",
    ", it would be difficult to make a precise estimate on the uncertainty because it is determined by non - perturbative qcd effects , thus only the order of magnitude of the results can be trusted . even then , our theoretical predictions are more consistent with the present data , i.e. the upper bounds set by the experiments .",
    "it seems that based on the pqcd approach , the obtained results are more consistent with data than the earlier analyses @xcite , thus one expects that the theoretical framework may reflect the real physics picture , at least works in this case .",
    "if the future experiments further reduce the upper bound and the theoretical estimate on the branching ratio of @xmath95 can not tolerate the new data even considering the range for the input parameters , one would confront a serious challenge to our understanding of the physics mechanisms , therefore , we hope that by improvement to reduce both statistical and systematic errors , new measurements of the babar and belle collaborations will provide important information towards the answer , otherwise we may need to wait for the data of the future lhc - b .    to be more accurate in both theory and experiment , we need to wait for more data and improvement in the method .",
    "indeed , a favorable channel for observing @xmath4 is decay of @xmath96 .",
    "however , unfortunately , the bes collaboration has not observed this mode and one needs to wait for the upgraded stage , i.e bes iii which would accumulate much larger database in future and then we can further investigate the consistency between theory and experiments .",
