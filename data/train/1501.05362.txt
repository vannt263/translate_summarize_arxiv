    "our main goal in this paper is to first briefly explain ( in  2 ) the general ideas and results concerning fractal strings and their complex dimensions which led to the intimate connections ( discussed in  3 ) between the vibrations of fractal strings and the riemann zeta function @xmath10 and then , the riemann hypothesis , discovered in the early 1990s by the author and his collaborators ( carl pomerance [ lappom1,2 ] and helmut maier [ lapmai1,2 ] , respectively ) . the resulting geometric interpretation of the critical strip @xmath17 for @xmath3 was made entirely rigorous by means of the mathematical theory of complex dimensions developed by the author and machiel van frankenhuijsen in a series of research monographs [ lap - vfr13 ] ( and papers ) . due to space limitations , we will not be able to do justice to this theory , for which the interested reader can refer to the latest book in the above series , [ lap - vfr3 ] , and many relevant references therein .",
    "+ in  6.3.1 and  6.3.2 of [ lap - vfr2,3 ] was introduced , at the semi - heuristic level , the notion of spectral operator @xmath1 , which sends the geometry onto the spectrum of a fractal string .",
    "intuitively , the parameter @xmath2 plays here the role of the upper bound for the minkowski dimensions of the fractal strings on which @xmath1 acts . in the forthcoming book ,",
    "@xcite , and in an associated series of papers , [ herlap25 ] , hafedh herichi and the author have developed a mathematical theory of the spectral operator , within a rigorous functional analytic framework .",
    "in particular , they have precisely determined its spectrum as well as that of the closely related infinitesimal shift ( of the real line ) @xmath5 , viewed as the first order differential operator @xmath18 acting on a suitable hilbert space of functions , the weighted @xmath19-space @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is arbitrary .",
    "it turns out that @xmath22 or , more briefly , @xmath23 in the sense of the functional calculus for the unbounded normal operator @xmath24 in this manner , the spectral operator @xmath1 can be viewed as a suitable quantization of the riemann zeta function .",
    "actually , in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , a quantized ( i.e. , an operator - valued ) dirichlet series , euler product representation and `` analytic continuation '' of @xmath25 are obtained ( for suitable values of @xmath2 and/or under appropriate assumptions ) .",
    "+ in this context , the question of the invertibility of the spectral operator is a key question .",
    "it is shown in @xcite ( see also [ herlap2,3 ] ) that @xmath1 is `` quasi - invertible '' for all @xmath16 [ equivalently , for all @xmath7 or for all @xmath26 respectively ] if and only the riemann hypothesis is true ( i.e. , iff @xmath27 with @xmath28 implies that @xmath29 ) .",
    "this result provides a natural operator theoretic counterpart of the result of the author and h. maier in [ lapma1,2 ] showing that a suitable inverse spectral problem , ( isp)@xmath30 , for fractal strings ( of dimension @xmath31 ) is true in all possible dimensions @xmath31 in @xmath32 ( or , equivalently , due to the functional equation of @xmath33 , for all @xmath34 or else for all @xmath35 , respectively ) if and only if the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) is true .",
    "+ in @xcite ( see also [ herlap2,3 ] ) , the spectrum of @xmath1 is shown to obey several `` mathematical phase transitions '' ; one conditionally ( i.e. , if rh holds ) , in the midfractal case ( in the sense of [ lap13 ] ) when @xmath36 , and another one unconditionally ( i.e. , independently of the truth of rh ) , at @xmath37 . the first phase transition is intimately connected with the universality of the riemann zeta function ( see [ herlap1,4 ] ) .",
    "a brief exposition of some of the most relevant results of [ herlap15 ] is provided in  4 of the present article . + the spectral reformulation of the riemann hypothesis obtained in @xcite , revisited and extended in [ lap - vfr13 ] in the light of the mathematical theory of complex dimensions , and given a rigorous operator theoretic version in [ herlap13 ] , is a symmetric criterion for rh .",
    "indeed , due to the functional equation satisfied by @xmath3 ( and thus connecting @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , it can be equivalently formulated for all values of the underlying parameter ( @xmath31 in [ lapmai1,2 ] and [ lap - vfr13 ] or @xmath2 in [ herlap15 ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the new criterion for the riemann hypothesis obtained in this paper is asymmetric , in the sense that it is only stated ( and valid ) for all values of the underlying parameter @xmath2 in the open interval @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , its counterpart for all values of @xmath2 in the symmetric interval @xmath41 can not be true , due to the universality of the riemann zeta function @xmath3 in the right critical strip @xmath42 . more specifically ,",
    "the main new result of this paper is the following ( see  5 and theorem [ t1 ] below ) : the spectral operator @xmath1 is invertible ( in the usual sense of the invertibility of an unbounded operator ) for all values of @xmath2 in @xmath40 if and only if the riemann hypothesis is true . again , this new _ asymmetric _ spectral reformulation of rh does not have any analog for the interval @xmath41 because the spectral operator is not invertible for any value of @xmath2 in @xmath41 .",
    "this raises the question of finding an appropriate physical interpretation for this asymmetry , which amounts to finding `` the '' physical origin of the phase transition ( conditionally ) occurring in the midfractal case where @xmath43 .",
    "+ in the previous context of the results of [ lapmai1,2 ] , early speculations were made by the author in [ lap2,3 ] to find a physical interpretation of the corresponding mathematical phase transition at @xmath44 in terms of wilson s notion of complex dimension within the realm of his theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena in quantum statistical physics and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "we leave it to the interested reader to find his or her physical interpretation of the asymmetric criterion for rh obtained in the present paper .",
    "our own expectation is that physically , this asymmetry or phase transition finds its source in the symmetry breaking associated to an appropriate ( and possibly yet to be discovered ) quantum field theory .",
    "( unlike in [ boscon1,2 ] or [ con ,  v.11 ] , it would occur at @xmath45 rather than at @xmath46 , the pole of @xmath33 . )",
    "presumably , this quantum field theory should be intimately associated with number theory ( or `` arithmetic '' ) , geometry , dynamics and spectral theory , and probably formulated in the spirit of the conjectural picture for the generalized riemann hypothesis ( grh ) proposed in the author s earlier book , _ in search of the riemann zeros _ : _",
    "strings , fractal membranes and noncommutative spacetimes _",
    "@xcite , in terms of a riemann flow on the moduli space of quantized fractal strings ( called `` fractal membranes '' ) and the associated flows of zeta functions ( or partition functions ) and of their zeros . however , we invite the readers to follow their own intuition and to be led into unknown mathematical and physical territory , wherever their own imagination will guide them . + in closing",
    "this introduction , we stress that the main goal of this paper ( beside providing in ",
    "24 a brief survey of earlier relevant work which partly motivates it ) is to obtain the following theorem , in  5 .",
    "( see theorem [ t5.4 ] and the comments surrounding it for additional information . )",
    "let @xmath47 be the nonnegative self - adjoint operator naturally associated with the normal operator @xmath48 . for notational simplicity , we write @xmath48 and @xmath49 instead of @xmath15 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "note that for @xmath51 , both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are unbounded linear operators ( according to the results of [ herlap14 ] discussed in  4 ) .",
    "[ t1 ] each of the following statements is equivalent to the riemann hypothesis @xmath52rh@xmath53    1 .   for every @xmath54",
    ", the spectral operator @xmath48 is invertible .",

    ", the unbounded operator @xmath49 is invertible .",
    "3 .   for every @xmath7 , the nonnegative self - adjoint operator @xmath49 is bounded away from zero .",
    "finally , we point out that for the reader s convenience , we have included ( just before the references ) a glossary of some of the main notation and terminology used in this paper .",
    "in this section , we give a brief overview of the theory of fractal strings and their complex dimensions ( see @xcite ) .      a _ fractal string _ is a one - dimensional drum with fractal boundary .",
    "hence , it can be realized geometrically as a bounded open subset of the real line : @xmath55 .",
    "as is well known , @xmath56 is then the disjoint union of its connected components ( open intervals ) .",
    "therefore , we can write it as a countable union of disjoint ( bounded ) open intervals @xmath57 denoting by @xmath58 the length of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath61 is nonincreasing and ( if @xmath62 is infinite , which will always be assumed from now on , in order to avoid trivial special cases ) that @xmath63 .",
    "since all of the key notions considered in fractal string theory are independent of the geometric realization @xmath56 , we may consider that a fractal string is equivalently given by the sequence of lengths ( or _ scales _ ) @xmath64 , with the distinct lengths written in nonincreasing order and according to their multiplicities .",
    "+ the geometric point of view , however , is essential to motivate and define the spectral problem associated with @xmath65 , as well as to connect and contrast the theory of fractal strings with the higher - dimensional geometric and spectral theory of fractal drums .",
    "+ to a given fractal string @xmath64 ( or @xmath55 ) , we associate the _ geometric zeta function _ of @xmath62 , denoted by @xmath66 , and defined ( for @xmath67 with @xmath68 large enough ) by @xmath69 as it turns out , @xmath66 is holomorphic in the open , right half - plane @xmath70 ( the set of all @xmath67 such that @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 is the largest such half - plane . here , the unique extended real number @xmath73 is called the _ abscissa of convergence _ of @xmath74 : @xmath75 ; see , e.g. , [ hardwr , ser ] .",
    "early on ( see [ lap23 ] and [ lap - vfr3 ,  1.2 ] ) , the author observed that @xmath31 coincides with the minkowski dimension of @xmath62 ( i.e. , of the boundary @xmath76 of any of its geometric realizations @xmath56 ) : @xmath77 . recall that this notion of fractal dimension ( often also called `` box dimension '' in the applied literature ) and very different mathematically and physically from the classic hausdorff dimension ( see @xcite ) , can be defined as follows : given @xmath78 ,",
