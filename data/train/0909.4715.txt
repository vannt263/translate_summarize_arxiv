    "in @xcite the problem of how to give an explicit combinatorial definition of weak higher categories was solved , and the development of a conceptual framework for their further analysis was begun . in the aftermath of this , the expository work of other authors , most notably street @xcite and leinster @xcite , contributed greatly to our understanding of these ideas .",
    "the central idea of @xcite is that the description of any @xmath0-dimensional categorical structure @xmath2 , may begin by starting with just the underlying @xmath0-globular set , that is , the sets and functions @xmath3^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { x_2 } \\ar@<1ex>[l]^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { x_3 } \\ar@<1ex>[l]^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { ... } \\ar@<1ex>[l]^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { x_n } \\ar@<1ex>[l]^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s}}\\ ] ] satisfying the equations @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which embody the the objects ( elements of @xmath6 ) , arrows ( elements of @xmath7 ) and higher cells of the structure in question . at this stage",
    "no compositions have been defined , and when they are , one has a globular set with extra structure . in this way",
    "the problem of defining an n - categorical structure of a given type is that of defining the monad on the category @xmath8 of @xmath0-globular sets whose algebras are these structures .",
    "as explained in the introduction to @xcite , this approach works because the monads concerned have excellent formal properties , which facilitate their explicit description and further analysis .",
    "the @xmath0-operads of @xcite can be defined from the point of view of monads : one has the monad @xmath9 on @xmath8 whose algebras are strict @xmath0-categories , and an @xmath0-operad consists of another monad @xmath1 on @xmath8 equipped with a cartesian monad morphism @xmath10 .",
    "the algebras of this @xmath0-operad are just the algebras of @xmath1 .",
    "strict @xmath0-categories are easily defined by iterated enrichment : a strict @xmath11-category is a category enriched in the category of strict @xmath0-categories via its cartesian product , but are too strict for the intended applications in homotopy theory and geometry . for @xmath12 the strictest structure one can replace an arbitrary weak @xmath13-category with  and not lose vital information  is a gray category , which is a category enriched in @xmath14 using the gray tensor product of 2-categories instead of its cartesian product @xcite .",
    "this experience leads naturally to the idea of trying to define what the higher dimensional analogues of the gray tensor product are , so as to set up a similar inductive definition as for strict @xmath0-categories , but to capture the appropriate semi - strict @xmath0-categories , which in the appropriate sense , would form the strictest structure one can replace an arbitrary weak @xmath0-category with and not lose vital information .",
    "crans in @xcite attempted to realise this idea in dimension 4 , and one of our main motivations is to obtain a theory that will deliver the sort of tensor product that crans was trying to define explicitly , but in a conceptual way that one could hope to generalise to still higher dimensions .",
    "our examples([ex : gray ] ) and ( [ ex : crans ] ) embody the progress that we have achieved in this direction in this paper . in @xcite the theory of the present paper",
    "is used to show that the _ funny tensor product _ of categories  which is what one obtains by considering the gray tensor product of @xmath15-categories but ignoring what happens to 2-cells  generalises to give an analogous symmetric monoidal closed structure on the category of algebras of any higher operad . from these developments",
    "it seems that a conceptual understanding of the higher dimensional analogues of the gray tensor product is within reach .",
    "fundamentally , we have two kinds of combinatorial objects important for the description and study of higher categorical structures ",
    "@xmath0-operads and tensor products . in @xcite",
    "a description of the relationship between tensor products and @xmath0-operads was begun , and @xmath11-operads whose algebras involve no structure at the level objects were canonically related with certain lax tensor products on @xmath8 . under this correspondence the algebras of the @xmath11-operad coincide with categories enriched in the associated lax tensor product .",
    "sections([sec : eg - lmc])-([sec:2-functoriality ] ) of the present paper continue this development by studying , for a given category @xmath16 , the passage @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the category of graphs enriched in @xmath16 , in a systematic way .",
    "this analysis culminates in section([sec:2-functoriality ] ) where the above assignment is seen as the object part of a 2-functor @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a sub 2-category of the 2-category of lax monoidal categories , and @xmath21 is as defined by the formal theory of monads @xcite .",
    "from this perspective , one is able to describe in a more efficient and general way , many of the previous developments of higher category theory in the globular style .",
    "for instance , in section([ssec : induction ] ) we give a short and direct explicit construction of the monads @xmath9 for strict @xmath0-categories from which all their key properties are easily witnessed . in sections([ssec : general - op - mult ] ) and ( [ ssec : induction ] ) we give shorter and more general proofs of some of the main results of @xcite . in section([ssec : monmonad - distlaw ] ) using a dual version of our 2-functor @xmath22 and the formal theory of monads @xcite , we obtain a satisfying general explanation for how it is that monad distributive laws arise in higher category theory ",
    "see @xcite @xcite . in sections([ssec",
    ": tci ] ) and ( [ ssec : tcii ] ) we apply our theory to simplifying many aspects of @xcite .    the correspondence between @xmath11-operads and certain lax monoidal structures on @xmath8 given in @xcite , associates to the 3-operad @xmath23 for gray categories , a lax tensor product on the category of 2-globular sets .",
    "however the gray tensor product itself is a tensor product of 2-categories .",
    "any lax monoidal structure on a category @xmath16 comes with a `` unary '' tensor product , which rather than being trivial as is the usual experience with non - lax tensor products , is in fact a monad on @xmath16 . for the lax tensor product induced by @xmath23 ,",
    "this is the monad for 2-categories . in section([sec : lift - mult ] ) we solve the general problem of lifting a lax monoidal structure , to a tensor product on the category of algebras of the monad defined by its unary part .",
    "this result , theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) , is the main result of the paper , and provides also the sense in which these lifted tensor products are unique . in practical terms",
    "this means that in order to exhibit a given tensor product on some category of higher dimensional structures as arising from our machinery , it suffices to exhibit an operad whose algebras are categories enriched in that tensor product . in this way , one is able see that the usual gray tensor product and that of crans , do so arise",
    ".    moreover applying this lifting to the lax tensor products on @xmath8 associated to general @xmath11-operads ( over @xmath24 ) , one exhibits the structures definable by @xmath11-operads as enriched categories whose homs are some @xmath0-dimensional structure . in this way",
    "the globular approach is more closely related to some of the inductive approaches to higher category theory , such as that of tamsamani @xcite .    in section([ssec :",
    "a - infinity ] ) we describe two applications of the lifting theorem . in theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) we construct a tensor product of @xmath25-algebras . as explained in @xcite",
    "the problem of providing such a tensor product is of relevance to string theory , and it proved resistant because of the negative result @xcite which shows that no `` genuine '' tensor product can exist .",
    "however this result does not rule out the existence of a _ lax _ tensor product , which is what we were able to provide in theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) .",
    "it is possible to see the identification by joyal and street @xcite , of braided monoidal categories as monoidal categories with a multiplication as an instance of theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) .",
    "another instance is our second application given in corollary([cor : coh - bm2c ] ) , namely an analogous result to that of joyal and street but for braided monoidal 2-categories .",
    "a weak @xmath0-category is an algebra of a _",
    "contractible _ @xmath0-operad . in section([sec : contractibility ] ) we recall this notion , give an analogous notion of contractible lax monoidal structure and explain the canonical relationship between them .    in this paper we operate at a more abstract level than in much of the previous work on this subject . in particular , instead of studying monads on the category of @xmath0-globular sets , or even on presheaf categories , we work with monads defined on some category @xmath18 of enriched graphs . as our work shows , the main results and notions of higher category theory in the globular style can be given in this setting .",
    "so one could from the very beginning start not with @xmath24 as the category of @xmath26-categories , but with a nice enough @xmath16 .",
    "for all the constructions to go through , such as that of @xmath9 , the correspondence between monads and lax tensor products , their lifting theorem , as well as the very definition of weak @xmath0-category , it suffices to take @xmath16 to be a locally c - presentable category in the sense defined in section([ssec : lcpres ] ) .    proceeding this way one obtains then the theory of @xmath0-dimensional structures enriched in @xmath16 .",
    "that is to say , the object of @xmath0-cells between any two @xmath27-cells of such a structure would be an object of @xmath16 rather than a mere set .",
    "some alternative choices of @xmath16 which could perhaps be of interest are : ( 1 ) the ordinal @xmath28=\\{0<1\\}$ ] ( for the theory of locally ordered higher dimensional structures ) , ( 2 ) simplicial sets ( to obtain a theory of higher dimensional structures which come together with a simplicial enrichment at the highest level ) , ( 3 ) the category of sheaves on a locally connected space , or more generally a locally connected grothendieck topos , ( 4 ) the algebras of any @xmath0-operad or ( 5 ) the category of multicategories ( symmetric or not ) . the point is , the theory as we have developed it is actually _ simpler _ than before , and the generalisations mentioned here come at _ no _ extra cost .",
    "given a topological space @xmath2 and points @xmath29 and @xmath30 therein , one may define the topological space @xmath31 of paths in @xmath2 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 at a high degree of generality . in recalling the details",
    "let us denote by @xmath32 a category of `` spaces '' which is complete , cocomplete and cartesian closed .",
    "we shall write @xmath33 for the terminal object .",
    "we shall furthermore assume that @xmath32 comes equipped with a bipointed object @xmath34 playing the role of the interval .",
    "a conventional choice for @xmath32 is the category of compactly generated hausdorff spaces with its usual interval , although there are many other alternatives which would do just as well from the point of view of homotopy theory .",
    "let us denote by @xmath35 the reduced suspension of @xmath2 , which can be defined as the pushout @xmath36 { i{\\times}x}=\"tr \" [ d ] { \\sigma{x}.}=\"br \" [ l ] { 1{+}1}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\":\"br\",:\"bl\":\"br \" ) \" br \" [ u(.3)l(.3 ) ] ( : @{-}[r(.15)],:@{-}[d(.15)])}\\ ] ] writing @xmath37 for the category of bipointed spaces , that is to say the coslice @xmath38 , the above definition exhibits the reduced suspension construction as a functor @xmath39 in a sense this functor is the mother of homotopy theory  applying it successively to the inclusion of the empty space into the point , one obtains the inclusions of the @xmath27-sphere into the @xmath0-disk for all @xmath40 , and its right adjoint @xmath41 is the functor which sends the bipointed space @xmath42 , to the space @xmath31 of paths in @xmath2 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "this adjunction @xmath43 is easy to verify directly using the above elementary definition of @xmath44 as a pushout , and the pullback square @xmath45 { x^i}=\"tr \" [ d ] { x^{1{+}1}}=\"br \" [ l ] { 1}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\":\"br\"^{x^i},:\"bl\":\"br\"_-{(a , b ) } ) \" tl \" [ d(.3)r(.3 ) ] ( : @{-}[l(.15)],:@{-}[u(.15)])}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the inclusion of the boundary of @xmath34 .",
    "the collection of spaces @xmath31 is our first example of an enriched graph in the sense of    [ def : enriched - graph ] let @xmath16 be a category .",
    "graph @xmath2 enriched in @xmath16 _ consists of an underlying set @xmath6 whose elements are called _ objects _ , together with an object @xmath31 of @xmath16 for each ordered pair @xmath47 of objects of @xmath2 .",
    "the object @xmath31 will sometimes be called the _ hom _ from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "a morphism @xmath48 of @xmath16-enriched graphs consists of a function @xmath49 together with a morphism @xmath50 for each @xmath47 .",
    "the category of @xmath16-graphs and their morphisms is denoted as @xmath18 , and we denote by @xmath51 the obvious 2-functor @xmath52 with object map as indicated .    the 2-functor @xmath51 is the mother of higher category theory in the globular style  applying it successively to the inclusion of the empty category into the point ( ie the terminal category ) ,",
    "one obtains the inclusion of the category of @xmath27-globular sets into the category of @xmath0-globular sets . in the case",
    "@xmath53 this is the inclusion with object map @xmath54 { ... } = \" m \" [ r ] { x_{n{-}1}}=\"r \" \" r\":@<1ex>\"m\":@<1ex>\"l \" \" r\":@<-1ex>\"m\":@<-1ex>\"l \" } } & \\mapsto & { \\xygraph{{x_0}=\"l \" [ r ] { ... } = \" m \" [ r ] { x_{n{-}1}}=\"r \" [ r ] { \\emptyset}=\"rr \" \" rr\":@<1ex>\"r\":@<1ex>\"m\":@<1ex>\"l \" \" rr\":@<-1ex>\"r\":@<-1ex>\"m\":@<-1ex>\"l \" } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] and when @xmath55 this is the functor @xmath56 which picks out the empty set .",
    "thus there is exactly one @xmath57-globular set which may be identified with the empty set .",
    "it is often better to think of @xmath51 as taking values in @xmath58 . by applying the endofunctor @xmath51 to the unique functor @xmath59 for each @xmath16 ,",
    "produces the forgetful functor @xmath60 which sends an enriched graph to its underlying set of objects .",
    "this manifestation @xmath61 has a left adjoint which we shall denote as @xmath62 for reasons that are about to become clear .",
    "the functor @xmath62 is a variation of the grothendieck construction . to a given functor",
    "@xmath63 it associates the category @xmath64 with objects triples @xmath65 where @xmath29 is an object of @xmath1 , and @xmath66 is an ordered pair of objects of @xmath67 .",
    "maps are just maps in @xmath1 which preserve these base points in the obvious sense .",
    "it is interesting to look at the unit and counit of this 2-adjunction . given a category @xmath16 , @xmath68 is the category of bipointed enriched graphs in @xmath16 .",
    "the counit @xmath69 sends @xmath42 to the hom @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath16 has an initial object @xmath70 has a left adjoint given by @xmath71 .",

    "consider the case where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the representable @xmath77",
    ". then @xmath64 may be regarded as the category of endo - cospans of the object @xmath26 , that is to say the category of diagrams @xmath78 and a point of @xmath73 is now just a map @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath1 is also cocomplete one can compute a left adjoint to @xmath80 . to do this note that a graph @xmath2 enriched in @xmath64 gives rise to a functor @xmath81 where @xmath6 is the set of objects of @xmath2 .",
    "for any set @xmath82 , @xmath83 is defined as the following category .",
    "it has two kinds of objects : an object being either an element of @xmath82 , or an ordered pair of elements of @xmath82 .",
    "there are two kinds of non - identity maps @xmath84 where @xmath66 is an ordered pair from @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is free on the graph just described . a more conceptual way to see",
    "this category is as the category of elements of the graph @xmath85 { z}=\"r \" \" l\":@<1ex>\"r \" \" l\":@<-1ex>\"r\"}\\ ] ] where the source and target maps are the product projections , as a presheaf on the category @xmath86 { = } [ r(1.25 ) ] { \\xybox{\\xygraph{0 [ r ] 1 \" 0\":@<1ex>\"1\":@<1ex>@{<-}\"0 \" } } } * \\frm{-}}\\ ] ] and so there is a discrete fibration @xmath87 .",
    "the functor @xmath88 sends singletons to @xmath75 , and a pair @xmath66 to the head of the hom @xmath89 .",
    "the arrow map of @xmath88 encodes the bipointings of the homs .",
    "one may then easily verify    let @xmath75 , @xmath77 and @xmath1 be cocomplete .",
    "then @xmath90 has left adjoint given on objects by @xmath91 .    in the exposition",
    "thus far we have focussed on building an analogy between the reduced suspension of a space and the graphs enriched in a category .",
    "now we shall bring these constructions together .",

    "the important properties of @xmath51 are apparent because of the close connection between @xmath51 and the @xmath96 construction .",
    "a very mild reformulation of the notion of @xmath16-graph is the following : a @xmath16-graph @xmath2 consists of a set @xmath6 together with an @xmath97-indexed family of objects of @xmath16 .",
    "together with the analogous reformulation of the maps of @xmath18 , this means that we have a pullback square @xmath98_{(-)_0=\\ca gt_v } \\save \\pos?(.3)=\"lpb \" \\restore \\ar[r]^- { } \\save \\pos?(.3)=\"tpb \" \\restore & { \\fam{v } } \\ar[d]^{\\fam(t_v ) } \\save \\pos?(.3)=\"rpb \" \\restore \\\\ { \\set } \\ar[r]_-{(-)^2 } \\save \\pos?(.3)=\"bpb \" \\restore & { \\set } \\pos \" rpb \" ; \" lpb \" * * @ { } ; ? !",

    "we conclude    [ prop : gfam2fun ] @xmath51 is a familial 2-functor .",
    "in particular it follows from the theory of @xcite that @xmath51 preserves conical connected limits as well as all the notions of `` grothendieck fibration '' which one can define internal to a finitely complete 2-category .",

    "see @xcite for more details on this part of 2-category theory .",
    "we shall not use these observations very much in what follows .",
    "more important for us is    [ lem : g - em - object ] @xmath51 preserves eilenberg - moore objects .    given a monad @xmath101 on a category @xmath16 , we shall write @xmath102 for the category of @xmath101-algebras and morphisms thereof , and @xmath103 for the forgetful functor",

    "[ def : nmnd ] let @xmath16 be a category . a monad _ over @xmath24 _ on @xmath18 is a monad on @xmath146 in the 2-category @xmath58 .",
    "that is , a monad @xmath147 on @xmath18 is over @xmath24 when the functor @xmath101 does nt affect the object sets , in other words @xmath148 for all @xmath127 and similarly for maps , and moreover the components of @xmath149 and @xmath150 are identities on objects . in this section",
    "we will describe how such a monad , in the case where @xmath16 has an initial object denoted as @xmath151 , induces a multitensor on @xmath16 denoted @xmath152 .",
    "let us describe this multitensor explicitly .",
    "first we note that @xmath153 enables us to regard any sequence of objects @xmath112 of @xmath16 as a @xmath16-graph .",
    "the object set is @xmath154 , @xmath155 for @xmath156 , and all the other homs are equal to @xmath151 .",
    "then we define @xmath157 and the unit as @xmath158 before defining @xmath159 we require some preliminaries . given objects @xmath160 of @xmath16 where @xmath156 , and @xmath161 denote by @xmath162 the obvious subsequence inclusion in @xmath18 : the object map preserves successor and @xmath163 , and the hom maps are identities . now given objects @xmath118 of @xmath16",
    "where @xmath164 and @xmath132 , one has a map @xmath165 given on objects by @xmath166 and @xmath167 for @xmath164 , and the hom map between @xmath168 and @xmath46 is @xmath169 . with these definitions in hand",
    "we can now define the components of @xmath159 as @xmath170 ^ -{\\{t\\tilde{\\tau}\\}_{0,k } } & & { t(z_{11}, ... ,z_{kn_k})(0,n_{\\bullet } ) } \\ar[rr]^-{\\mu_{0,n_{\\bullet } } } & & { \\tbar\\limits_{ij}z_{ij}}}.\\ ] ] from now until the end of ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we shall be occupied with the proof of    [ thm : tbar ] let @xmath16 be a category with an initial object @xmath151 and @xmath147 be a monad over @xmath24 on @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath152 as defined in ( [ eq : tbar])-([eq : mubar ] ) defines a multitensor on @xmath16 .",
    "in principle one could supply a proof of this result immediately by just slogging through a direct verification of the axioms .",
    "instead we shall take a more conceptual approach , and along the way encounter various ideas that are of independent interest . for most of the time we will assume a little more of @xmath16 : that it has finite coproducts , to enable our more conceptual approach . in the end",
    "though , we will see that only the initial object is necessary .",
    "we break up the construction of @xmath152 into three steps .",
    "first in ( [ ssec : nmonad->monmonad ] ) , we describe how @xmath171 acquires a monoidal structure and @xmath147 induces a monoidal monad @xmath172 on @xmath171 .",
    "then we see that this monoidal monad induces a lax monoidal structure on @xmath171 , which in turn can be transferred across an adjunction to obtain @xmath152 .",
    "these last two steps are very general : they work at the level of the theory of lax algebras for an arbitrary 2-monad ( which in our case is @xmath114 ) .",
    "so in ( [ ssec : laxalg - const1 ] ) and ( [ ssec : laxalg - const2 ] ) we describe these general constructions , and in ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we finish the proof of theorem([thm : tbar ] ) .",
    "finally in ( [ ssec : path - like ] ) we present a condition on @xmath101 which ensures that @xmath101-algebras and @xmath173-categories may be identified .",
    "from now until just before the end of ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we shall assume that @xmath16 has finite coproducts .",
    "we now describe some consequences of this .",
    "first , the functor @xmath174 which sends an enriched graph to its set of objects becomes representable .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath26 the @xmath16-graph which represents @xmath175 .",
    "it has one object and its unique hom is @xmath151 .",
    "the second consequence is that @xmath171 inherits a natural monoidal structure and any normalised monad @xmath147 on @xmath18 can then be regarded as a monoidal monad @xmath172 .",
    "the explanation for this begins with the observation that the representability of the underlying set functor @xmath175 enables a useful reformulation of the category @xmath171 as the category of endocospans of @xmath26 as in section([ssec : enriched - graphs ] ) .",
    "the usefulness of this is that such cospans can be composed , thus endowing @xmath171 with a canonical monoidal structure .",
    "the presence of @xmath151 in @xmath16 enables one to compute coproducts in @xmath18 .",
    "the coproduct @xmath2 of a family @xmath176 of @xmath16-graphs has object set given as the disjoint union of the object sets of the @xmath177 , @xmath178 when @xmath107 and @xmath179 are objects of @xmath177 , and all the other homs are @xmath151 .",
    "with finite coproducts available one can also compute pushouts under @xmath26 , that is the pushout @xmath180 of maps @xmath181 ^ -{y } \\ar[l]_-{x } & y}\\ ] ] in @xmath18 is described as follows . the object set of @xmath180",
    "is the disjoint union of the object sets of @xmath2 and @xmath182 modulo the identification of @xmath107 and @xmath179 , and let us write @xmath183 for this special element of @xmath180 .",
    "the homs of @xmath180 are inherited from @xmath2 and @xmath182 in almost the same way as for coproducts .",
    "that is if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are either both objects of @xmath2 or both objects of @xmath182 and they are not both @xmath183 , then their hom @xmath184 is taken as in @xmath2 or @xmath182 .",
    "the hom @xmath185 is the coproduct @xmath186 .",
    "otherwise this hom is @xmath151 .",
    "note that in the special case where the homs @xmath187 and @xmath188 are both @xmath151 , one only requires the initial object in @xmath16 to compute this pushout .",
    "given a sequence @xmath189 of doubly - pointed @xmath16-graphs , one defines their _ join _",
    "@xmath190 where @xmath191 is the colimit of @xmath192_-{b_1 } \\ar[r]^-{a_2 } & { ... } & 0 \\ar[l]_-{b_{n-1 } } \\ar[r]^-{a_n } & { x_n}}\\ ] ] in @xmath18 which can be formed via iterated pushouts under @xmath26 .",
    "this defines a monoidal structure on @xmath171 whose tensor product we denote as @xmath193 .",
    "given a functor @xmath194 over @xmath24 , one has a functor @xmath195 whose object map is indicated on the right in the previous display .",
    "when both @xmath16 and @xmath196 have an initial object , one defines for each sequence of doubly - pointed @xmath16-graphs a map @xmath197 as follows .",

    "moreover any natural transformation @xmath205 over @xmath24 defines a monoidal natural tranformation @xmath206 .",

    "finally we note that the functor @xmath211 has a left adjoint @xmath212 which we shall now describe .",
