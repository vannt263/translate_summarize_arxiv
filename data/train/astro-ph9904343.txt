    "starting in 1996 we undertook a long term project , direct ( as in `` direct distances '' ) , to obtain the distances to two important galaxies in the cosmological distance ladder  m31 and m33  using detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) and cepheids .",
    "these two nearby galaxies are stepping stones to most of our current effort to understand the evolving universe at large scales .",
    "first , they are essential to the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale ( jacoby et al .  1992 ; tonry et al .",
    "second , they constrain population synthesis models for early galaxy formation and evolution and provide the stellar luminosity calibration .",
    "there is one simple requirement for all this  accurate distances .",
    "debs have the potential to establish distances to m31 and m33 with an unprecedented accuracy of better than 5% and possibly to better than 1% .",
    "these distances are now known to no better than 10 - 15% , as there are discrepancies of @xmath1 between various distance indicators ( e.g.  huterer , sasselov & schechter 1995 ; holland 1998 ; stanek & garnavich 1998 ) . detached eclipsing",
    "binaries ( for reviews see andersen 1991 ; paczyski 1997 ) offer a single step distance determination to nearby galaxies and may therefore provide an accurate zero point calibration  a major step towards very accurate determination of the hubble constant , presently an important but daunting problem for astrophysicists .",
    "a deb system was recently used by guinan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to obtain an accurate distance estimate to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the detached eclipsing binaries have yet to be used ( huterer et al .",
    "1995 ; hilditch 1996 ) as distance indicators to m31 and m33 .",
    "according to hilditch ( 1996 ) , there were about 60 eclipsing binaries of all kinds known in m31 ( gaposchkin 1962 ; baade & swope 1963 , 1965 ) and only _ one _ in m33 ( hubble 1929 ) , none of them observed with ccds .",
    "only now does the availability of large - format ccd detectors and inexpensive cpus make it possible to organize a massive search for periodic variables , which will produce a handful of good deb candidates .",
    "these can then be spectroscopically followed - up with the powerful new 6.5 - 10 meter telescopes .",
    "the study of cepheids in m31 and m33 has a venerable history ( hubble 1926 , 1929 ; gaposchkin 1962 ; baade & swope 1963 , 1965 ) .",
    "freedman & madore ( 1990 ) and freedman , wilson & madore ( 1991 ) obtained multi - band ccd photometry of some of the already known cepheids , to build period - luminosity relations in m31 and m33 , respectively .",
    "however , both the sparse photometry and the small samples ( 11 cepheids in m33 and 38 cepheids in m31 ) do not provide a good basis for obtaining direct baade - wesselink distances ( see , e.g. , krockenberger , sasselov & noyes 1997 ) to cepheids  the need for new digital photometry has been long overdue .",
    "recently , magnier et al .  ( 1997 ) surveyed large portions of m31 , which have previously been ignored , and found some 130 new cepheid variable candidates .",
    "their light curves are , however , rather sparsely sampled and in the @xmath2-band only .    in kaluzny",
    "et al .  ( 1998 , 1999 , hereafter : papers i and iv ) and stanek et al .  ( 1998 , 1999 , hereafter : papers ii and iii ) , the first four papers of the series , we presented the catalogs of variable stars found in four fields in m31 , called m31b , m31a , m31c and m31d . here",
    "we present the catalog of variables from the field m31f . in sec.2",
    "we discuss the selection of the fields in m31 and the observations . in sec.3",
    "we describe the data reduction and calibration . in sec.4",
    "we discuss briefly the automatic selection we used for finding the variable stars . in sec.5",
    "we discuss the classification of the variables . in sec.6",
    "we present the catalog of variable stars , followed by a brief discussion of the results in sec.7 .",
    "m31 was primarily observed in 1996 with the 1.3  m mcgraw - hill telescope at the michigan - dartmouth - mit ( mdm ) observatory .",
    "we used the front - illuminated , loral @xmath3 ccd `` wilbur '' ( metzger , tonry & luppino 1993 ) , which at the @xmath4 station of the 1.3  m telescope has a pixel scale of @xmath5 and field of view of roughly @xmath6 .",
    "we used kitt peak johnson - cousins @xmath7 filters .",
    "data for m31 were also obtained , mostly in 1997 , with the 1.2  m telescope at the f. l. whipple observatory ( flwo ) , where we used `` andycam '' ( szentgyorgyi et al .  1999 ) , with a thinned , back - illuminated , ar coated loral @xmath3 pixel ccd .",
    "the pixel scale happens to be essentially the same as at the mdm 1.3  m telescope .",
    "we used standard johnson - cousins @xmath7 filters .",
    "fields in m31 were selected using the mit photometric survey of m31 by magnier et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and haiman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ( see paper i , fig.1 ) .",
    "we selected six @xmath8 fields , m31a  f , four of them ( a  d ) concentrated on the rich spiral arm in the northeast part of m31 , one ( e ) coinciding with the region of m31 searched for microlensing by crotts & tomaney ( 1996 ) , and one ( f ) containing the giant star formation region known as ngc206 ( observed by baade & swope 1965 ) .",
    "fields a  c were observed during september and october 1996 five to eight times per night in the @xmath2 band , resulting in total of 110160 @xmath2 exposures per field .",
    "fields d  f were observed once a night in the @xmath2-band . some exposures in @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "were also taken .",
    "m31 was also observed , in 1996 and 1997 , at the flwo 1.2  m telescope , whose main target was m33 .    in this paper",
    "we present the results for the m31f field .",
    "we obtained for this field useful data during 29 nights at the mdm , collecting a total of @xmath11 exposures in @xmath2 and @xmath12 exposures in @xmath10 .",
    "we also obtained for this field useful data during 22 nights at the flwo , in 1996 and 1997 , collecting a total of @xmath13 exposures in @xmath2 , @xmath14 exposures in @xmath10 and @xmath15 exposures of @xmath9 .",
    "the details of the reduction procedure were given in paper i. preliminary processing of the ccd frames was done with the standard routines in the iraf - ccdproc package .",
    "stellar profile photometry was extracted using the _ daophot / allstar _ package ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) .",
    "we selected a `` template '' frame for each filter using a single frame of particularly good quality .",
    "these template images were reduced in a standard way ( paper i ) .",
    "other images were reduced using _",
    "allstar _ in the fixed - position - mode using as an input the transformed object list from the template frames . for each frame",
    "the list of instrumental photometry derived for a given frame was transformed to the common instrumental system of the appropriate `` template '' image .",
    "photometry obtained for the @xmath16 and @xmath10 filters was combined into separate data bases .",
    "@xmath10-band images obtained at the mdm were reduced using flwo `` templates '' .",
    "two templates were used in the case of @xmath2-band images .",
    "an mdm template was used to fix the positions of the stars .",
    "the @xmath2 photometry was transformed to the instrumental system of an flwo template .",
    "the photometric @xmath17 calibration of the mdm data was discussed in paper i. in addition , for the field m31f on the night of 1997 october 9/10 we have obtained independent @xmath7 calibration with the flwo 1.2  m telescope .",
    "there was an offset of @xmath18 in @xmath2 and @xmath19 in @xmath20 between the flwo and the mdm calibration .",
    "the @xmath2 offset is well within our estimate of the total @xmath21 systematic error discussed in paper i , and the @xmath20 offset falls slightly above .",
    "we also derived equatorial coordinates for all objects included in the data bases for the @xmath2 filter .",
    "the transformation from rectangular coordinates to equatorial coordinates was derived using 79 stars identified in the usno - a2.0 catalog .",
    "we have also compared these coordinates with those given by magnier et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and find a good agreement , with an average difference of @xmath22 for 66 of the transformation stars found in both catalogs .",
    "the procedure for selecting the variables was described in detail in paper i , so here we only give a short description , noting changes when necessary .",
    "the reduction procedure described in previous section produces databases of calibrated @xmath7 magnitudes and their standard errors .",
    "the @xmath2 database for m31f field contains 7997 stars , with up to 108 measurements , the @xmath10 database contains 26540 stars with up to 69 measurements and the @xmath9 database contains 3382 stars with up to 7 measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : dist ] shows the distributions of stars as a function of mean @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 magnitude .",
    "as can be seen from the shape of the histograms , our completeness starts to drop rapidly at about @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the primary reason for this difference in the depth of the photometry between @xmath29 and @xmath10 is the level of the combined sky and background light , which is about three times higher in the @xmath10 filter than in the @xmath29 filters .",
    "the measurements flagged as `` bad '' ( with unusually large _ daophot _ errors , compared to other stars ) and measurements with errors exceeding the average error , for a given star , by more than @xmath30 are removed .",
    "usually zero to 10 points are removed , leaving the majority of stars with roughly @xmath31 @xmath2 measurements . for further analysis",
    "we use only those stars that have at least @xmath32 measurements .",
    "there are 5838 such stars in the @xmath2 database of the m31f field .",
    "our next goal is to select a sample of variable stars from the total sample defined above .",
    "there are many ways to proceed , and we largely follow the approach of stetson ( 1996 ) , also described in paper  i. in short , for each star we compute the stetson s variability index @xmath33 ( paper i , eq.7 ) , and stars with values exceeding some minimum value @xmath34 are considered candidate variables .",
    "the definition of @xmath33 is rooted in the assumption that on each visit to the program field at least one pair of observations is obtained , and only when both observations have the residual from the mean of the same sign does the pair contribute positively to the variability index .",
    "the definition of stetson s variability index includes the standard errors of individual observations .",
    "if , for some reason , these errors were over- or underestimated , we would either miss real variables , or select spurious variables as real ones .",
    "using the procedure described in paper i , we scale the _ daophot _ errors to better represent the `` true '' photometric errors .",
    "we then select the candidate variable stars by computing the value of @xmath33 for the stars in our @xmath2 database .",
    "we used a cutoff of @xmath35 and additional cuts described in paper i to select 122 candidate variable stars ( about 2% of the total number of 5838 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : stetj ] we plot the variability index @xmath33 vs. apparent visual magnitude @xmath24 for 5838 stars with @xmath36 .",
    "we based our candidate variables selection on the @xmath2 band data collected at the mdm and the flwo telescopes .",
    "we also have the @xmath37-bands data for the field , up to 69 @xmath10-band epochs and up to 7 @xmath9-band epochs , although for a variety of reasons some of the candidate variable stars do not have a @xmath9 or @xmath10-band counterpart .",
    "we will therefore not use the @xmath37 data for the period determination and broad classification of the variables .",
    "we will however use the @xmath37 data for the `` final '' classification of some variables .",
    "next we searched for the periodicities for all 122 candidate variables , using a variant of the lafler - kinman ( 1965 ) string - length technique proposed by stetson ( 1996 ) .",
    "starting with the minimum period of @xmath38 , successive trial periods are chosen so @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the time span of the series .",
    "the maximum period considered is @xmath41 . for each candidate",
    "variable 10 best trial periods are selected ( paper i ) and then used in our classification scheme .",
    "the variables we are most interested in are cepheids and eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) .",
    "we therefore searched our sample of variable stars for these two classes of variables .",
    "as mentioned before , for the broad classification of variables we restricted ourselves to the @xmath2 band data .",
    "we will , however , present and use the @xmath37-bands data , when available , when discussing some of the individual variable stars .    for ebs",
    ", we used the search strategy described in paper ii . within our assumption the light curve of an eb",
    "is determined by nine parameters : the period , the zero point of the phase , the eccentricity , the longitude of periastron , the radii of the two stars relative to the binary separation , the inclination angle , the fraction of light coming from the bigger star and the uneclipsed magnitude .",
    "a total of six variables passed all of the criteria .",
    "we then went back to the ccd frames and tried to see by eye if the inferred variability is indeed there , especially in cases when the light curve is very noisy / chaotic .",
    "we decided to remove two dubious eclipsing binaries , classifying one as a periodic variable with half the determined period .",
    "its light curve is presented in section  6.3 .",
    "the remaining four ebs with their parameters and light curves are presented in the section  6.1 .    in the search for cepheids",
    "we followed the approach by stetson ( 1996 ) of fitting template light curves to the data .",
    "we used the parameterization of cepheid light curves in the @xmath2-band as given by stetson ( 1996 ) .",
    "there was a total of 64 variables passing all of the criteria ( paper i and ii ) , but after investigating the ccd frames we removed 12 dubious `` cepheids '' , which leaves us with 52 probable cepheids .",
    "their parameters and light curves are presented in section  6.2 .    after the selection of four eclipsing binaries , 52 cepheids and one periodic variable , we were left with 65 `` other '' variable stars . after raising the threshold of the variability index to @xmath42 ( paper i )",
    "we are left with 17 variables . after investigating the ccd frames we removed 10 dubious variables from the sample , which leaves seven variables which we classify as miscellaneous .",
    "their parameters and light curves are presented in the section  6.4 .",
    "in this section we present light curves and some discussion of the 64 variable stars discovered by our survey in the field m31f . and",
    "( when available ) @xmath37 photometry and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) @xmath2 finding charts for all variables are available from the authors via the anonymous ftp from the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics and can be also accessed through the world wide web . ]",
    "the variable stars are named according to the following convention : letter v for `` variable '' , the number of the star in the @xmath2 database , then the letter `` d '' for our project , direct , followed by the name of the field , in this case ( m)31f , e.g. v244 d31f .",
    "tables  [ table : ecl ] , [ table : ceph ] , [ table : per ] and [ table : misc ] list the variable stars sorted broadly by four categories : eclipsing binaries , cepheids , other periodic variables and `` miscellaneous '' variables , in our case meaning `` variables with no clear periodicity '' .      in table",
    "[ table : ecl ] we present the parameters of the four eclipsing binaries in the m31f field .",
    "the light curves of these variables are shown in figure  [ fig : ecl ] , along with the simple eclipsing binary models discussed in the papers i and ii .",
    "the variables are sorted in the table  [ table : ecl ] by the increasing value of the period @xmath45 . for each eclipsing binary",
    "we present its name , j2000.0 coordinates ( in degrees ) , period @xmath45 , magnitudes @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the system outside of the eclipse , and the radii of the binary components @xmath48 in the units of the orbital separation .",
    "we also give the inclination angle of the binary orbit to the line of sight @xmath49 and the eccentricity of the orbit @xmath50 .",
    "the reader should bear in mind that the values of @xmath51 and @xmath50 are derived with a straightforward model of the eclipsing system , so they should be treated only as reasonable estimates of the `` true '' value .",
    "one of the eclipsing binaries found , v1835 d31f , is a good deb candidate .",
    "however , a much better light curve is necessary to accurately establish the properties of the system .",

    "some cepheids seem to be brighter in the @xmath9 band than in @xmath2 .",
