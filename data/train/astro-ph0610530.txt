    "the bipolar homunculus nebula surrounding @xmath0 carinae offers an unusually well - constrained laboratory to study a wide array of physical processes in the interstellar medium .",
    "the distance , size , shape , orientation , and structure of the nebula are all known ( smith 2006 ; davidson et al .",

    "/ visual wavelengths the homunculus is seen mainly in reflection . the dust that absorbs and scatters this light acts as a calorimeter by re - emitting the absorbed luminosity in the infrared ( ir ) , providing us with a practical and accurate measure of the bolometric luminosity of the central source ( e.g. , smith et al.2003b ; cox et al .  1995 ; hackwell et al .  1986 ; davidson 1971 ; pagel 1969 ; westphal & neugebauer 1969 ) . despite these constraints",
    ", @xmath0 car s nebula is such a bright and complex object that it leaves no shortage of observational puzzles .",
    "these can sometimes make it difficult to see the trees for the forest .",
    "relevant physical conditions in the homunculus nebula can be constrained if we understand the origin of the distinct double - shell structure in the walls of the nebula .",
    "these layers manifest themselves in three independent ways that have been clearly observed .",
    "first , high resolution thermal - ir images reveal a stratification in the dust color temperature , with a thin outer shell at @xmath9140 k , and a warmer , thicker inner zone with a color temperature of @xmath9200 k ( smith et al .",
    "second , near - ir spectra show an outer skin of h@xmath1 , and an inner shell in tracers of dense , low - ionization atomic gas like collisionally - excited lines of [ fe  ii ] ( smith 2006 , 2002a ) .",
    "these two layers are segregated from one another .",
    "third , the two distinct shells can be seen at different radial velocities in uv absorption profiles along our line - of - sight to the star ( gull et al .",
    "2006 , 2005 ; nielsen et al .",
    "the outer molecular layer is also detected in uv absorption lines of ch and oh ( verner et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the inner layer is also seen in visual - wavelength emission lines like [ ni  ii ] and [ fe  ii ] , plus faint emission of h@xmath10 and [ n  ii ] ( davidson et al.2001 ; hillier & allen 1992 ; allen & hillier 1993 ; smith et al.2003a ) .",
    "a detailed account of this structure was given recently in paper i ( smith 2006 ) .",
    "it is this pronounced double - shell structure that we aim to reproduce in the model presented here .",
    "we are particularly interested in the physical conditions that allow h@xmath1 to form and survive in such a thin layer .",
    "so far , @xmath0 carinae is the only luminous blue variable ( lbv ) known to be surrounded by molecular gas in its own ejecta , while nearly all lbv nebulae exhibit bright near - ir emission of [ fe  ii ] ( smith 2002b ; smith & hartigan 2006 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 is probably a consequence of the extreme youth and high density of the nebula .",
    "new observations presented in paper i , obtained with the phoenix spectrograph on the gemini south telescope , have shown the h@xmath1 layer to be surprisingly thin ( only a few per cent of the radius ) and uniformly so , despite the fact that it traces a wide range of different radii at various latitudes in the bipolar nebula .",
    "this hints that the near - ir h@xmath1 emission arises at the inside surface of an optically - thick shell , which absorbs the remainder of whatever fuv radiation penetrates the inner [ fe  ii]-emitting zone .",
    "by varying the density in this outer shell , we can test what physical density permits h@xmath1 to survive .",
    "this density constraint , in turn , provides an independent measure of the mass of the homunculus because the geometric thickness of the shell is known .",
    "the total mass is thought to be at least 12 m@xmath8 derived from ir dust observations ( smith et al .",
    "car s grains may have unusual composition ( chesneau et al .",
    "here we are fine - tuning an earlier uniform - density shell model for the physical conditions in the homunculus ( ferland et al .",
    "2005 ) in order to account for the observed thin structure of the h@xmath1 layer .",
    "we simulate the conditions within the nebula using the development version of cloudy , last described by ferland et al .",
    "the incident stellar continuum is represented by an interpolated 20,000  k costar atmosphere with a total luminosity of 5@xmath310@xmath11 . to account for the hard x - rays from the colliding wind binary system , we add a high - energy component corresponding to a 3@xmath310@xmath12 k blackbody with a luminosity of 30 @xmath13 ( e.g. , corcoran et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the lack of a prominent h  ii region shows that few hydrogen - ionizing photons strike the inner edge of the nebula , most likely due to absorption by the stellar wind .",
    "therefore , we extinguish the net continuum by photoelectric absorption from a neutral hydrogen layer of 10@xmath14 @xmath15 to account for this . some high - energy photons are transmitted and they help drive the chemistry .",
    "we also include the galactic background cosmic ray ionization rate , although the actual ionization rate may be higher if radiative nuclei are present .",
    "cosmic rays have effects that are similar to x - rays , providing ionization that helps drive the chemistry .",
    "we adopt solar gas phase abundances except for the following : he / h=0.4 , [ c / h]=4.4 , [ n / h]=2.82 , and [ o / h]=4.12 . the gas : dust mass ratio was set to the normal ism value of 100 , and we adopted silicate grains rather than graphitic grains because the 2175   absorption feature is absent in observations ( e.g. , hillier et al .",
    "2006 ) and the 10  @xmath16 silicate emission feature is strong ( see , however , chesneau et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we chose the nebular geometry to be a thick shell separated into two radial zones , where the concentric shells are permitted to have different densities .",
    "table 1 gives our adopted geometric and physical properties of the double - shell structure .",
    "the inner shell ( zone 1 ) has lower density and is geometrically thicker , corresponding to the gas traced by infrared [ fe  ii ] lines and warm @xmath9200 k dust .",
    "the outer shell ( zone 2 ) is very thin , and corresponds to the material traced by h@xmath1 emission and cooler @xmath9140 k dust .",
    "the outer edge of the inner shell is directly in contact with the inner surface of the outer shell .",
    "we calculated the physical conditions in these two zones separately in cloudy , using the _ transmitted _ continuum at the outside of zone 1 as the _ incident _ continuum for zone 2 .",
    "although the shells were calculated using spherical symmetry in cloudy , they are meant to approximate the observed properties of the nebula roughly along our sight line through the polar region of the bipolar lobes .",
    "the equatorial region of the nebula with much smaller radii was modeled separately ( see below ) .",
    "the inner and outer radii for the two zones were taken directly from observations ( paper i ) and are not free parameters .",
    "our goal is to investigate the densities in these two zones , to answer the following questions : 1 ) what is the density in zone 1 that is consistent with the observed @xmath17 value of @xmath1810@xmath19 @xmath5 ( smith 2002a ) and permits significant fuv radiation to fully penetrate the shell , causing iron to remain as fe@xmath6 throughout ?",
    "2 ) what is the minimum density in zone 2 that allows hydrogen to become predominantly molecular , and iron to recombine to fe@xmath7 ?",
    "the most important free parameters here are therefore the value of @xmath20 chosen for each zone , but other factors like the gas : dust mass ratio and the filling factor play roles as well",
    ". the main determining factor in whether or not h@xmath1 can survive in zone 2 is the attenuation of fuv radiation in the lyman and werner bands by the total column density of gas and dust in both zones . based on spatially - resolved infrared [ fe  ii ] spectra ( paper i ) we adopt a volume filling factor of 0.5 in zone 1 . from similar h@xmath1 spectra and the size scales of structures seen in _ hst",
    "_ images ( morse et al .",
    "1998 ) we adopt a filling factor of 0.9 for the thin outer shell in zone 2 .",
    "a fraction of 0.9 also matches the fraction of the total stellar luminosity absorbed by dust grains that is reemitted in the ir , while @xmath910% of the starlight escapes at near - uv and visual wavelengths .",
    "finally , we note that we have ignored the possible influence of the little homunculus ( ishibashi et al .",
    "this inner nebula has a much lower mass  a few percent of the homunculus ( smith 2005 )  and is apparently clumpy on large scales , allowing both radiation and wind to leak through .",
    "thus , its influence should be minimal , absorbing whatever small amount of lyman continuum radiation may escape the dense stellar wind , causing strong variability in the radio continuum ( duncan et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of a cloudy calculation matched to observations of the polar lobes of the homunculus roughly along our line - of - sight ( paper i ) .",
    "the transition between zones 1 and 2 is sudden at a depth of a little more than 7@xmath310@xmath21 cm , showing a thick inner zone traced by [ fe  ii ] and a very thin outer shell seen in h@xmath1 emission . in order to reproduce this sharp transition ,",
    "the simulation required a strong density increase of a factor of 1530 from zone 1 to 2 .    throughout zone 1 , hydrogen remains fully atomic , while fe is singly ionized ( representative values about halfway through zone 1 give an h@xmath1 fraction of 5@xmath310@xmath22 and a neutral fe fraction of 2@xmath310@xmath23 ) .",
    "the electron density from infrared [ fe  ii ] line ratios in zone 1 is n@xmath2410@xmath19 @xmath5 ( smith 2002a ) . to match this constraint ,",
    "the hydrogen density in zone 1 was set to 10@xmath25 @xmath5 , since n@xmath26/n@xmath27 was only about 3% at this distance from the star .",
    "only 12% of the hydrogen was ionized at the innermost edge of zone 1 , probably through balmer continuum ionization from the 2s level .",
    "this may account for the faint h@xmath10 emission there ( smith et al .",
    "2003a ; davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) , as well as faint radio continuum ( duncan et al .",
    "1997 ) . in both zone 1 and 2 ,",
    "heating of the gas was dominated ( @xmath2890% ) by grain - gas photoelectric heating , whereas direct heating by line absorption was minimal .    to investigate the formation of h@xmath1 and the recombination of fe in zone 2 we considered several different values for the hydrogen density , and discuss a few representative values here :",
    "n@xmath27=10@xmath29 , 10@xmath30 , 10@xmath31 , 10@xmath32 , and 10@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "table 1 lists the properties in zone 2 at these various densities , and figure 2 gives a detailed view of the transition to molecular gas for each of these adopted densities .",
    "with n@xmath27=10@xmath29 @xmath5 , we found that h@xmath1 did not form at all , with h remaining fully atomic and fe remaining singly ionized throughout zone 2 . when the density was raised to 2@xmath310@xmath29 @xmath5",
    ", h@xmath1 did begin to form at the outer edge of zone 2 ; the molecular fraction reached a maximum of about 40% at the outermost edge ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , fe remained singly ionized throughout zone 2 at this density .",
    "this is not in agreement with observations , since fe  i absorption is seen from zone 2 in uv spectra ( nielsen et al .",
    "2005 ) , so the density must be higher than 2@xmath310@xmath29 @xmath5 . at a density of 3@xmath310@xmath29 @xmath5 , hydrogen became 99% molecular at the outer edge of the shell ( fig .",
    "2 ) , but fe@xmath6 still did not recombine to fe@xmath33 .",
    "observations suggest that h@xmath1 should form and the recombination of fe should occur _ early _ in zone 2 , especially at the remote polar regions where the radiation field is weaker than at other latitudes .",
    "this condition is met only for higher hydrogen densities around 10@xmath32 to 10@xmath4 @xmath5 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "at a depth of only about 10@xmath34 cm into zone 2 ( 1020% of the way through the layer ) , the h@xmath1 fraction begins to rise sharply .",
    "this is because its destruction rate collapses as uv radiation in the lyman and werner bands becomes optically thick and is extinguished by the much higher column density of gas and dust encountered here .",
    "once molecules begin to form , the transition is rapid .",
    "hydrogen remains fully molecular throughout the rest of zone 2 , while fe@xmath6 does finally recombine .",
    "the fe@xmath6/fe@xmath7 transition occurs at a slightly larger depth than the atomic / molecular hydrogen transition , because fe@xmath7 can still be ionized by balmer continuum photons with wavelengths longer than the lyman - werner bands .",
    "the hydrogen density is probably not much above 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , because then the h@xmath1 shell would be thicker than observed , and the extinction to the star would be unreasonably high .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 1 shows the dust temperature for various grain radii at a range of depths through the shell . in zone 1 , we see that only the largest grains with radii @xmath350.2 @xmath16 can match the observed dust color temperatures .",
    "the transition to higher densities at the beginning of zone 2 is accompanied by a sharp drop in the grain temperature , as observed in mid - ir images ( smith et all.2003b ) .",
    "this sharp drop to lower grain temperatures only occurred for the highest - density models with n@xmath27=10@xmath32 to 10@xmath36 @xmath5 in zone 2 .",
    "the grain temperature in zone 2 appears to be independent of grain size .",
    "this is perhaps because much of the short - wavelength fuv radiation has been extinguished and the grains are heated predominantly by radiation at near - uv , visual , and ir wavelengths instead , where the absorption efficiency is less sensitive to grain size ( e.g. , draine 2003 ) . in this case",
    ", grain - gas photoelectric heating will drop as well .",
    "in fact , we see that the grain temperature eventually drops to within 20 k of the equilibrium blackbody temperature t@xmath37 ( dashed line ) , independent of grain radius .",
    "the fact that the temperature in zone 2 is nearly independent of grain size is interesting , because it contradicts long - held conventional wisdom .",
    "the observed near - blackbody color temperature has often been taken as an indication that the grains have radii of 12 @xmath16 ( smith et al .  2003b , 1998 ; polomski et al .",
    "1999 ; hackwell et al .  1986",
    "; mitchel et al .  1983 ) .",
    "however , figure 1 indicates that grains this large may not be necessary to explain the grain temperature in zone 2 after all ( although some large grains are still needed for the nearly gray extinction ; rodgers 1971 ; hillier 2006 ; whitelock et al .",
    "in particular , a population that includes _ both _ large and small grains is evidently allowed in zone 2 .",
    "the visual extinction through zone 1 is only @xmath91 mag , compared to about 4.59 magnitudes for zone 2 ( table 1 ) .",
    "thus , the thin outer h@xmath1 shell dominates the visual extinction , the total infrared luminosity , and also the scattered light seen in visual - wavelength images and hard x - rays ( corcoran et al .",
    "this is why model shapes for the homunculus derived from [ fe  ii ] or [ ni  ii ] emission from zone 1 ( davidson et al .",
    "2001 ; allen & hillier 1991 ) are too small compared to images , whereas model shapes derived from h@xmath1 emission have the correct apparent size ( paper i ) .",
    "the stellar continuum that illuminates the nebula is strongly reprocessed by the inner region before it reaches the denser outer zone .",
    "figure 3 shows the stellar continuum ( the smoother dotted line ) that is incident upon the inner nebula .",
    "the gray solid line with many spectral emission features is the net emission that emerges from the inner region and goes on to irradiate the molecular gas in zone 2 .",
    "this continuum is a combination of the attenuated incident continuum plus reprocessed emission from the inner nebula .",
    "the uv continuum has been heavily absorbed by dust within the inner region .",
    "thermal dust emission dominates the infrared continuum , and the dust is warm enough for the 10  @xmath16 silicate feature to come into emission .",
    "many emission lines , mainly atomic and singly ionized species , are formed in the inner region .",
    "the major effect of this reprocessed continuum will be upon dust in the outer nebula .",
    "much of the incident uv continuum has been converted into thermal - ir emission already .",
    "the uv is the most effective in photoelectrically heating gas , so the outer nebula is cooler as a result of the absence of this light , as noted earlier .",
    "the very strong infrared continuum heats the outer nebula indirectly , by first heating the dust , which then shares its energy with the gas as the result of gas - dust collisions .",
    "the emergent spectrum from zone 2 with @xmath20=10@xmath32 @xmath5 is shown with the solid black line in figure 3 .",
    "as expected , the thermal - ir continuum is shifted toward longer wavelengths because of the cooler dust , and the uv / visual light is more severely attenuated than for zone 1 .",
    "interestingly , when we compare the spectrum from zone 1 alone to the emergent spectrum from zone 2 ( which includes the emergent spectrum of zone 1 that passes through zone 2 ) , we see that the 10  @xmath16 silicate feature has a different shape  the silicate profile from zone 2 is somewhat muffled , indicating that the emission is beginning to turn optically thick .",
    "in fact , when the density is increased to @xmath20=10@xmath4 @xmath5 in zone 2 ( dashed gray line ) the silicate feature turns clearly to self - absorption .",
    "this trend in the silicate profile shape has two important implications .",
    "first , when the emission begins to turn optically thick , the silicate profile appears wider and flatter , and the peak moves toward longer wavelengths .",
    "this effect will modify the required contribution from other grain species like corrundum ( see chesneau et al .",
    "second , the strong silicate feature observed in @xmath0 car s mid - ir spectrum may indicate that densities of @xmath20=10@xmath4 @xmath5 are too high ( although the effects of clumping are an issue ) . if densities near our lower bound @xmath20=10@xmath32 @xmath5 are preffered , then a total mass of the homunculus near 16 m@xmath8 is favored over a much larger value of @xmath930 m@xmath8 ( see  5.1 ) .",
    "this is , perhaps , a relief .",
    "high spatial resolution spectroscopy of the silicate profile in the homunculus could provide a powerful and independent constraint on the density and total mass of the nebula .",
    "near - infrared h@xmath1 emission is seen at all latitudes in the homunculus ( paper i ) , even though the distance from the star changes by an order of magnitude . in the side walls of the polar lobes at mid - latitudes ,",
    "the oblique incident angle of the radiation ( i.e. `` seasons '' ) will mitigate the stronger radiation field at closer radii to the central star , but this geometric advantage disappears for the molecular gas at the pinched - waist of the nebula .",
    "thus , we also investigate the physical conditions in the equatorial plane of the homunculus , where h@xmath1 is seen nearest to the star .",
    "the equatorial model was identical to the polar lobe / line - of - sight model , except that the radii and thicknesses of zones 1 and 2 were adjusted to match observations ( paper i ) , and the density in zone 1 was increased .",
    "the equatorial model is summarized in table 2 .",
    "figure 4 shows the results of a cloudy calculation matched to observations of the radial stratification in the equatorial plane of the homunculus ( paper i ) .",
    "the inner radius is set approximately equal to the distance between the star and the weigelt knots , which is 0@xmath382 to 0@xmath383 ( smith et al .  2004 ; dorland et al .",
    "2004 ) , or roughly 10@xmath21 cm if we correct for the 41  inclination angle ( paper i ; davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) . in order to match observed electron densities of @xmath3910@xmath29 @xmath5 in the weigelt knots and other bright equatorial ejecta ( smith 2002 ; hamann et al .  1999 , 1994 ; davidson et al .",

    "to 10@xmath40 @xmath5 ( hamann et al .",
    "] this was also the highest density that allowed h to remain predominantly atomic and fe to remain as fe@xmath6 throughout zone 1 .",
    "even though the material is much closer to the star and feels a much stronger radiation field than in the polar model , @xmath210@xmath4 @xmath5 in zone 2 was still sufficient to allow a sharp transition to molecular hydrogen and neutral fe .    unlike the polar model",
    ", the inner edge of zone 1 experienced a more substantial h@xmath6 fraction of @xmath975% , while @xmath920% of the iron was ionized to fe@xmath41 .",
    "this ionization occurs despite the fact that , aside from hard x - rays ( corcoran et al .",
    "2001 ) , we did not include radiation from a hot companion star in our calculation . throughout most of zone 1 ,",
    "the typical molecular hydrogen fraction was of order 10@xmath42 , while the neutral fe fraction was typically 10@xmath23 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 4 shows the dust temperature for grains in the equatorial model . in zone 1",
    ", the predicted dust temperatures greatly exceed observational constraints on the color temperature for most grain sizes .",
    "the hottest extended dust in the core of the homunculus ( associated with the weigelt knots and more distant ejecta ) is about 550 k ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ; chesneau et al .",
    "this is marginally consistent with @xmath43=0.2 @xmath16 grains within observational uncertainty , but the observed tempertures would be more consistent with significantly larger grains .",
    "the transition to lower dust temperature at the boundary between zones 1 and 2 is not as stark as in the polar model , but like the polar model , the grain temperature in zone 2 drops and becomes insensitive to grain size ( fig .  4 ) . here",
    "it fully reaches temperatures as low as the equilibrium blackbody temperature t@xmath37 .",
    "figure 5 shows the incident ( dotted ) and transmitted energy distributions for the equatorial model .",
    "the transmitted radiation is that which escapes from the outer boundary of zone 2 .",
    "this emission at the equator is of particular interest , as it illuminates material in the equatorial skirt at larger radii .",
    "some of that equatorial gas has pecular spectral properties , like the so - called `` strontium filament '' ( hartman et al .",
    "2004 ; zethson et al .  2001 ; bautista et al .  2006 , 2002 ) , the very bright and possibly fluorescent [ ni  ii ] @xmath447379 emission ( davidson et al .  2001 ) , and he  i @xmath4410830 emission ( smith 2002 ) . in figure 5",
    "we see that radiation shortward of 2000   is severely attenuated , while near - uv radiation beyond this limit remains strong .",
    "our most important observational constraint on the density in the polar lobes is that molecular hydrogen is able to survive and fe becomes neutral , even though they are within only 0.1 pc of the most luminous hot supergiant in our galaxy .",
    "furthermore , both of these conditions should be met in the polar model of zone 2 with some room to spare , since h@xmath1 emission is seen to be fairly uniform at all latitudes , including lower latitudes closer to the equator ( and closer to the star ) where the radiation field is stronger .",
    "as we have discussed above , these constraints are only met for high densities of n@xmath27=10@xmath45 @xmath5 in zone 2 .    from the thermal - ir spectral energy distribution and conservative assumptions , smith",
    "( 2003b ) derived a lower limit to the total mass of the homunculus of about 12.5 m@xmath8 ( about 11 m@xmath8 in the cool 140 k shell , and 1.5 m@xmath8 in the warmer inner shell ) .",
    "if this mass of cool dust were spread evenly over the volume of the h@xmath1 shell inferred observationally , the density would be at least n@xmath27=10@xmath31 @xmath5 in zone 2 ( paper i ) .",
    "however , our cloudy calculations show that even higher densities are likely , as noted above .",
    "these higher average densities distributed over the same volume would imply a total gas mass for the homunculus in the range of roughly 1535 m@xmath8 .",
    "thus , our study confirms the large mass of the homunculus deduced from ir observations of dust , but uses an independent method sensitive to the gas density .",
    "it also confirms that previous ir estimates were indeed lower limits to the total mass .",
    "we also find that 35 m@xmath8 is an upper limit to the mass , since for densities much higher than 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , the transition to molecular gas would occur earlier and the h@xmath1 shell would be thicker than observed .",
    "caveats : although our mass estimate is sensitive to the gas density , it is not completely independent of the gas : dust ratio , since dust helps attenuate the uv radiation in the lyman - werner bands that destroys h@xmath1 , and grains act as a catalyst by providing a surface for h@xmath1 formation .",
    "however , like mass estimates from thermal - ir dust emission , these are probably underestimates if they are wrong .",
    "our cloudy calculations were tuned to match the observed structure in ir lines of h@xmath1 and [ fe  ii ] , but they naturally reproduce the bimodal stratification of the observed dust color temperature as well .",
    "high - resolution thermal - ir images show a thick inner shell at @xmath9200 k and a thin outer shell at @xmath9140 k ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ) , where the cooler dust color temperatures are coincident with the outer h@xmath1 shell .",
    "this is clearly reproduced in our model ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "our earlier simulations with cloudy used a uniform density of 10@xmath29 @xmath5 throughout a thick shell ( ferland et al .",
    "2005 ) and were able to reproduce a transition from h to h@xmath1 and fe@xmath6 to fe@xmath7 at some point within the shell , _ but in that model a sharp drop in dust temperture did not occur at the same position as the onset of h@xmath1_. instead , in the constant - density thick - shell model , the dust temperature began to drop immediately at the inner radius of the shell and continued smoothly thereafter .",
    "therefore , the observed sharp transition from a geometrically thick zone of @xmath9200 k to a very thin layer of @xmath9140 k dust coincident with the onset of the thin h@xmath1 shell ( fig",
    ".  1 ) gives a robust and independent confirmation that a sharp density contrast between the two zones is indeed required .    because of the strong density increase of a factor of 15 - 30 from zone 1 to zone 2",
    ", the model also successfully reproduced the relative contributions to the total mass observed in each component .",
    "fits to the ir spectral energy distribution ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ) show that the 200 k dust in the inner shell only contains about 10% of the total mass in the nebula , while the rest of the mass resides in the thin outer shell at 140 k. because the outer shell is so thin , it must be much denser in order to have a higher total mass .",
    "the relative masses for the inner ( @xmath91 m@xmath8 ) and outer ( 16 - 33 m@xmath8 ) shells in table 1 agree with these observational constraints . by stark contrast",
    ", a uniform - density thick shell would have much more mass in the [ fe  ii ] zone .",
    "interestingly , the radial behavior of the dust temperature brings into question long - held notions about the grain properties .",
    "several authors have noted that the low dust color temperatures at thermal - ir wavelengths are close to the equilibrium blackbody temperatures at those radii , suggesting large grain sizes above @xmath461  @xmath16 ( mitchell et al .",
    "1983 ; mitchell & robinson 1986 ; hackwell et al.1986 ; robinson et al .",

    "silicate emission feature , but chesneau et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , mitchell & robinson ( 1978 ) , and hyland et al .",
    "( 1979 ) have suggested that this may be due to a partial contribution from other grain emission features like corrundum .",
    "] in contrast , we find that the dust temperature in the outer layer is _ independent of grain size _ ( figs .  1 and 4 ) , and approaches the equilibrium blackbody temperature even for small grains .",
    "the material becomes optically thick and severely attenuates the uv radiation , leaving the burden of energy balance to heating by longer wavelength radiation . at longer wavelengths",
    ", the difference between absorption efficiency and the thermal - ir emissivity is smaller , allowing small and large grains to maintain similar temperatures .",
    "the dust temperature never gets below the equilibrium blackbody temperature in our calculations .",
    "therefore , the very low dust temperature of 110 k that morris et al .",
    "( 1999 ) deduced from fits to the far - ir spectral energy distribution is probably too low , especially at the small radii in the equator suggested by those authors .",
    "although the temperature is apparently independent of grain size in zone 2 , very small grains are not permitted in zone 1 because corresponding high temperatures are not seen there .",
    "the color temperature in zone 1 is about @xmath9200 k , which would be consistent with grains of radius @xmath350.2  @xmath16 .",
    "thus , our calculations relax but do not eliminate the constraints on large grain size posed by the low observed dust temperatures in the homunculus . allowing the presence of somewhat smaller grains may be relevant to the high degree of polarization ( thackeray 1961 ; visvanathan 1967 ; warren - smith et al .  1979 ; meaburn et al .  1987 ; 1993 ;",
    "walsh & ageorges 2000 ) and the unusual scattering properties of the homunculus seen in high - resolution polarization imaging ( schulte - ladbeck et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "an accurate model for zone 1 determines the radiation field that penetrates it to illuminate the outer h@xmath1 shell ( fig .",
    "3 ) , but the inner shell is interesting in its own right because of the physical conditions that give rise to the extraordinarily bright infrared [ fe  ii ] emission seen there ( paper i ) .",
    "these bright infrared [ fe  ii ] emission lines are a common feature of other lbv nebulae ( smith 2002b ; smith & hartigan 2006 ) , which is in contrast to the outer h@xmath1 shell that seems to make @xmath0  car unique among hot luminous stars .    to investigate this bright [ fe  ii ] emission in detail",
    ", we ran cloudy using the more sophisticated large fe atom .",
    "this predicts the strength of numerous fe lines , including the distinct [ fe  ii ] ( @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath48 ) transitions in the 12 @xmath16 region .",
    "for example , with solar fe abundance , our cloudy model for zone 1 predicts a total luminosity for [ fe  ii ] @xmath4416435 of about 65 l@xmath8 . this line has been observed extensively in @xmath0  car in both moderate and high resolution spectra ( smith 2002a ; paper i ) , and exhibits an average brightness in the polar lobes of about 2@xmath310@xmath49 ergs s@xmath50 @xmath15 arcsec@xmath51 ( although the local value is highly spatially dependent ) .",
    "integrating this over the roughly 140 - 150 arcsec@xmath52 projected area of the homunculus would indicate a total flux in this line of 3@xmath310@xmath22 ergs s@xmath50 @xmath15 ( excluding the bright [ fe  ii ] contribution from the little homunculus ; smith 2005 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a total observed [ fe  ii ] @xmath4416435 luminosity of about 4050 l@xmath8 .",
    "the agreement between our model s predicted luminosity of 65 l@xmath8 and the observed value of @xmath945 l@xmath8 in this same line is remarkable , considering that the bipolar homunculus has a somewhat smaller projected area on the sky than the equivalent - radius spherical shell in cloudy .",
    "this match indicates that the gas - phase fe abundance is indeed roughly solar in zone 1 .",
    "a solar gas - phase fe abundance here is actually quite astonishing . in dusty regions of the ism ,",
    "the abundance of fe is normally depleted by two orders of magnitude due to the formation of fe - bearing grains ( e.g. , shields 1970 ) .",
    "we do nt expect the overall dust - to - gas ratio in zone 1 to be unusually low , since the mass inferred for the gas from the observed electron density agrees with the mass measured from the 200 k dust component that occupies the same region ( uncertainties of a factor of 2 are likely , but not factors of 100 ) .",
    "therefore , some process has selectively destroyed fe - bearing grains _ without _ destroying the remaining grain population , or some mechanism has specifically inhibited the formation of fe - bearing grains .",
    "shock speeds @xmath2880 km",
    "s@xmath50 can destroy iron grains and release the corresponding atomic fe into the gas phase .",
    "while we see no spectroscopic evidence for such fast shocks in the polar lobes today , shocks of this speed may have been active earlier in the life of the homunculus .",
    "if such shocks destroyed the fe - bearing grains early - on , they may have been released into an environment where the density was too low to reform the grains , locking fe in the gas phase .",
    "alternatively , the ejecta in the homunculus are c- and o - poor , and n - rich .",
    "the low oxygen abundance may have inhibited the formation of iron oxides , which can be an important repository for storing fe in the solid phase of the ism . in the absence of c , o , and fe",
    ", grains might form preferentially with al , mg , or ca instead . interestingly",
    ", mid - ir spectroscopy of the homunculus strongly suggests the presence of al - bearing grains like corrundum ( mitchell & robinson 1978 ; hyland et al .",
    "1979 ; chesneau et al .",
    "we also know that fe is present in the gas phase in the outer h@xmath1 shell , since fe@xmath7 is seen in absorption there in uv spectra ( gull et al .  2005 ; nielsen et al.2005 ) .",
    "the existence of a region of the ism with a high dust content and where fe is predominantly in the gas phase has important ramifications beyond the study of @xmath0 carinae , and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we have shown that the observed double - shell structure of the homunculus requires a strong density jump in the walls of the nebula .",
    "the observed transition from atomic to molecular gas ( paper i ) and the corresponding drop in dust temperature ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ) result when fuv radiation propagating through the low - density inner zone suddenly encounters the high densities in the thin outer shell .",
    "the absorption of this uv radiation in the lyman - werner bands by gas and dust in the dense outer shell regulates the destruction rate of h@xmath1 , allowing the h@xmath1 to survive .",
    "the required density contrast between these two zones is a factor of roughly 1530 .",
    "while our cloudy calculations explain how the observed properties of the double - shell structure result from a strong density stratification , they do not explain the origin of the density structure itself .",
    "since the homunculus appears to be expanding ballistically ( smith & gehrz 1998 ) and because the current stellar wind is too weak to shape the massive nebula , it is likely that this density structure was determined early . the observed",
    "stratification is reminiscent of the layered structure seen in cooling zones behind shock fronts ; although this is unlikely to be occuring at the present time ( paper i ) , the observed density structure may be frozen - in to the ejecta from shocks that occurred during the event itself as the dense material cooled .",
    "as noted in the previous section , shocks present during an earlier epoch would also be interesting from the point of view of the gas - phase fe abundance .",
    "the rapid cooling of this dense layer may have triggered severe thermal instabilities , which in turn , could explain the currently - observed clumping and fragmentation seen in images of the homunculus ( morse et al .",
    "1998 ) . alternatively",
    ", the low - density inner zone may result from a photoevaporative flow off the inside face of the much denser outer h@xmath1 shell , as is commonly seen in photodissociation regions at the surfaces of giant molecular clouds .",
    "finally , an obvious possibility is that the two shells simply result from separate ejection events during the @xmath920 yr timespan of the great eruption . we know that this is at least plausible from the existence of the outer ejecta , the homunculus , and the little homunculus , indicating that @xmath0 car has suffered multiple mass ejections ( walborn 1976 ; walborn et al .",
    "1978 ; ishibashi et al .  2003 ; smith 2005 ) .",
    "our models that reproduce the fundamental observed structure have constrained the most basic physical properties of the homunculus : namely , its density and temperature .",
    "these will allow further refinements to models trying to understand emission line spectra , unusual grain properties , molecular chemistry , abundances , and radiative transfer models of the appearance of @xmath0 car s nebula in images . the physical explanation for this distinct double - shell structure may have wider applications as well , especially to objects like planetary nebulae .",
    "for example , the bipolar nebula m2 - 9 has a similar and pronounced double - shell structure , with a thin outer h@xmath1 shell and an inner [ fe  ii ] shell ( smith et al .",
    "2005 ; hora & latter 1994 ) . the uv radiation field of m2 - 9 is known to be highly asymmteric and time variable because of a central binary system ( e.g. , doyle et al .",
    "2000 ) , so it is likely that a density jump controls the shape of the h@xmath1 lobes , as in @xmath0 car . our cloudy models for @xmath0 car would then suggest that the transition from atomic to molecular gas in such pne would be accompanied by a similar sharp drop in observed dust color temperature at mid - ir wavelengths , possibly insensitive to grain size as well .      since @xmath0 car is the only lbv nebula known to have a dense h@xmath1 shell , we must ask if this is a truly unique property of @xmath0 car itself , or if it is simply a consequence of @xmath0 car being observed at a special time so soon after its mass ejection ; the homunculus is also the _ youngest _ lbv nebula . we expect that in the decades immediately following the outburst , the ejecta around @xmath0 car were extremely dense and self - shielding , permitting the formation of not only dust , but also h@xmath1 and even more complex polyatomic molecules like ammonia ( smith et al .",
    "the physical conditions in this early high - density epoch are of great interest .",
    "this material has since been expanding and thinning , as the observed extinction drops and the star brightens ( whitelock et al .",
    "1983 ; davidson et al .",
    "1999 ; smith et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "due to the high mass of the homunculus and its relatively empty surroundings , the shell will continue to expand quasi - ballistically .",
    "thus , the hydrogen density will drop as @xmath53 , and because of ballistic motion , roughly as @xmath54 as well . in another couple",
    "hundred years , the density in the nebula will drop below the threshold at which h@xmath1 can survive ( this may happen even sooner , since @xmath0 car resides in a giant h  ii region with a strong ambient uv field ) .",
    "eventually , the homunculus will become an atomic shell resembling the massive shells seen around other lbvs and lbv candidates , like the more evolved nebulae around the pistol star ( figer et al .",
    "1999 ) , ag car ( voors et al .",
    "2000 ) , and p cygni ( smith & hartigan 2006 ) . at these later stages ,",
    "the homunculus may even overtake and mix with more distant outer ejecta ( walborn 1976 ) , appearing as a single ring - like lbv nebula , thereby erasing the details of its eruptive history .",
    "we have modeled the basic double - shell structure in the homunculus , as traced most vividly by near - ir emisison from [ fe  ii ] and h@xmath1 ( paper i ) .",
    "our aim was to constrain the density which permits the survival of h@xmath55 , and thus , to provide an independent constraint on the mass of the homunculus and the physical conditions in the nebula .",
    "the main observational constraints on our cloudy models were the geometric thickness of each zone , the electron density in the inner [ fe  ii ] zone , and the survival of both h@xmath1 and fe@xmath7 in the thin outer zone .",
    "our primary conclusions are as follows :        \\3 .",
    "the relative mass of gas in the two zones closely matches that derived for warm and cool dust components in the same two zones ( smith et al .",
    "this suggests that previous assumptions of a normal gas : dust mass ratio of 100 are not wildly in error .",
    "we predict a sharp drop in the dust temperature between the inner and outer zones of the double shell , as observed ( smith et al .",
    "the temperature in the outer zone approache the equilibrium blackbody temperature independent of grain size , due to shielding of uv radiation .",
    "this relaxes constraints on the unusually large grains inferred from observed dust temperatures .",
    "even though dust formation was efficient in the ejecta of @xmath0 car , we find that the gas phase fe abundance is still roughly solar .",
    "one normally expects fe to depleted by two orders of magnitude in dusty environments .",
    "this has occurred despite the severe depletion of c and o in the ejecta .",
