    "<S> , we use the starlight event generator for the simulation of the virtual photon flux and then use the maid unitary isobar model for the simulation of the neutron production in the interactions of a virtual photon with a polarized proton . in the @xmath1 hadronic interaction simulation , </S>",
    "<S> the differential cross sections for forward neutron production are predicted by a simple one - pion exchange model and the glauber model . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated @xmath0 values for both the contribution of ultraperipheral collisions and the hadronic interactions are in good agreement with the phenix results . </S>"
