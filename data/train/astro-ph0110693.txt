    "as the closest observed supernova in nearly 400 years , sn 1987a in the large magellanic cloud offers unique opportunities for detailed study of the evolution of a supernova and the birth of a supernova remnant . in the 14 years",
    "since the explosion was detected , it has been extensively studied in all wavelength bands from radio to gamma - ray using both ground- and space - based observatories .",
    "these observations have revealed a complex evolution of both the supernova itself and the supernova remnant which is developing as the ejecta and their associated shocks interact with the circumstellar material .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic of these observations are the optical observations which show the beautiful triple - ringed structure surrounding and illuminated by the supernova ( burrows et al .",
    "the inner ring is believed to represent an equatorial density enhancement in the circumstellar gas at the interface between a dense wind emitted from an earlier red - giant phase of the supernova progenitor star , sk@xmath7202 , and a faster wind emitted by this star in more recent times ( crotts , kunkel & heathcote 1995 ; plait et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the past few years",
    ", there has been increasing evidence for interaction of the expanding ejecta or the associated shocks with the equatorial ring , with small regions of enhanced h@xmath8 emission , or ` hotspots ' appearing just inside the ring .",
    "the first of these was detected by pun et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , but studies of ground - based and _ hubble space telescope _  ( _ hst _ ) data by lawrence et al . ( 2000 ) show that this spot was detectable as far back as march 1995 ( day 2933 since the supernova ] ) .",
    "lawrence et al . also present evidence for up to eight additional regions of enhanced emission from about day 4300 ( december 1998 ) .",
    "the most prominent are the original spot at position angle @xmath9 and a group of spots just south of east between position angles of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    at radio wavelengths , the initial outburst was very short - lived ( turtle et al .",
    "1987 ) compared to other radio supernovae ( e.g. weiler et al .",
    "this prompt outburst is attributed to shock acceleration of synchrotron - emitting electrons in the stellar wind close to the star at the time of the explosion ( storey & manchester 1987 ; chevalier & fransson 1987 ) .",
    "after about three years , in mid-1990 , radio emission was again detected from the supernova , with the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) at 843 mhz ( ball et al .",
    "1995 ) and with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 1.4 , 2.4 , 4.8 and 8.6 ghz ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1992 ; gaensler et al .",
    "this emission has increased more - or - less monotonically since its first detection . the spectral index over the observed frequency range has remained close to @xmath12 , indicating optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "x - ray emission was observed to turn on at about the same time as the second phase of radio emission and also has increased in intensity since then ( gorenstein , hughes & tucker 1994 ; hasinger , aschenbach & trmper 1996 ) .",
    "recent observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _  have resolved the x - ray emission into an approximately circular shell ( burrows et al .",
    "this second phase of increasing emission is attributed to the interaction of shocks driven by the ejecta with circumstellar material and is distinct from the interaction with a radially decreasing stellar wind which characterises radio supernovae .",
    "it therefore signifies the birth of the _ remnant _ of sn 1987a  the first observation of the birth of a supernova remnant .",
    "we use the name snr 1987a for the remnant .    by late-1992 ,",
    "snr 1987a was sufficiently strong to image at 9  ghz using the atca ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "this image , which exploited super - resolution to resolve the source , showed that the remnant was roughly circular with a diameter of about 08 , fitting inside the optical equatorial ring ( reynolds et al .",
    "1995 ) , and with bright lobes to the east and west , suggesting an annular structure with an axis similar to that of the optical emission .",
    "the eastern lobe was about 20% brighter than the western lobe . to follow the evolution of this structure",
    ", the remnant has been imaged at roughly yearly intervals since 1992 .    despite the increasing brightness",
    ", the size of snr 1987a is increasing only slowly .",
    "gaensler et al . (",
    "1997 ) fitted a model consisting of a thin spherical shell to the @xmath13-plane data and showed that , between 1992 and 1995 , the average expansion velocity of the remnant was only @xmath14 km s@xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , the average expansion speed between 1987 and 1991 was about 35,000 km s@xmath15 ( jauncey et al .",
    "comparison of four images obtained between 1992 and 1995 showed that the brightness of the lobes increased relative to that of the spherical shell and that the asymmetry between the east and west lobes increased markedly over this period ( gaensler et al .",
    "1997 ) . by 1995 , the peak brightness of the eastern lobe was 1.8 times that of the western lobe .",
    "the only other young supernova which has been imaged with high resolution at radio wavelengths is sn 1993j in m81 .",
    "frequent observations using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques ( e.g. van dyk et al .",
    "1994 , marcaide et al .",
    "1997 , bartel et al .",
    "2000 ) have shown that the radio emission is in the form of an expanding shell , the outline of which is nearly circular , but rather lumpy .",
    "unlike snr 1987a , sn 1993j remains in the radio supernova stage with decreasing flux density , making further imaging difficult .",
    "recent observations of sn 1980k ( montes et al .",
    "1998 ) and sn 1979c ( montes et al . 2000 ) have shown variations in the rate of decline of flux density or , in the case of sn 1979c , possibly small increases , indicating variations in the density of the circumstellar medium , but , like sn 1993j , these objects are best considered to be still in their radio supernova stage .",
    "the slow expansion velocity of snr 1987a suggests that the expanding shock and the leading ejecta have encountered a significant density enhancement , greatly reducing their velocity ( chevalier 1992 ; duffy , ball & kirk 1995 ; chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ) .",
    "these models assume spherical symmetry and hence do not account for the increasing asymmetry of the source .",
    "furthermore , they do not predict the continuing increase in brightness of the remnant as observed by ball et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and discussed further below .",
    "an alternative explanation for the slow apparent expansion velocity is that the shock excites slowly moving clumps of circumstellar material and then moves on .",
    "ball & kirk ( 1992 ) modelled the emission observed up to day 1800 by shock heating of two clumps and obtained a good fit to the data up to that time .",
    "as discussed by gaensler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , it is not easy to account for the observed asymmetry of snr 1987a",
    ". models involving the annular structure of the circumstellar material ( e.g. chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ) have difficulty accounting for the degree of enhancement in the lobes and the east - west asymmetry .",
    "similar difficulties are encountered in trying to explain the optical hotspots .",
    "lawrence et al .",
    "( 2000 ) conclude that `` fingers or jets '' in the distribution of ejecta from the supernova is the most plausible explanation .    in a recent publication ,",
    "ball et al . (",
    "2001 ) have analysed the 843 mhz flux densities observed with most to 2000 may ( day 4820 ) .",
    "they find a transition from a declining rate of increase observed from about mid-1991 ( day @xmath16 ) to early-1995 ( day @xmath17 ) , to a larger and constant rate of increase , @xmath18jy day@xmath15 , since then .",
    "this change in slope occurred at about the same time as the appearance of the first optical hotspot ( lawrence et al .",
    "2000 ) , suggesting a possible connection .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the atca observational data base from 1995 to february 2001 ( day 5100 ) and discuss these results in conjunction with those of ball et al .",
    "the evolution of the radio flux densities is discussed in section 2 .",
    "the sequence of images is extended to late-2000 and discussed in relation to recent optical and x - ray imaging in section 3 .",
    "future prospects are canvassed in section 4 .",
    "flux density monitoring observations of snr 1987a are made using the atca at 4  6 week intervals using one of the 6-km array configurations .",
    "observations are made simultaneously at two frequencies , either 1380 and 2496 mhz ( 2368 mhz before mid-1997 ) or 4790 and 8640 mhz .",
    "a 128-mhz bandwidth is observed at all frequencies .",
    "the two frequency pairs are observed alternately , with 20 min on snr 1987a and 3 min on phase calibrators before and after the snr observation , with a total observation time typically of 12 hours .",

    "flux calibration is relative to pks  b1934 - 638 , assumed to have flux densities of 14.95 , 11.14 , 5.83 and 2.84 jy at the four frequencies , respectively .",
    "data are first checked for obvious interference or telescope problems , flagged if necessary and then are processed using miriad scripts to ensure consistency .",
    "visibility data are calibrated in both phase and amplitude and images formed using baselines longer than 3 k@xmath22 .",
    "these images are cleaned and sources above a threshold identified .",
    "a table of source positions and integrated and peak flux densities is output for each frequency . at least at the two higher frequencies , snr 1987a",
    "is resolved and so integrated flux densities are quoted . an unresolved source , j0536 - 6919 , is present on all images with an observed flux density ranging between 80 mjy at 1.4 ghz and 6 mjy at 8.6 ghz and serves as a check on the system calibration .",

    "it lies at about 1.5 primary beam radii from the pointing centre , so it s flux density measurements at this frequency are not very reliable .",
    "measured flux densities for snr 1987a are given in appendix 1 .",
    "figure  [ fg : fluxes ] shows the measured flux densities of snr 1987a at the four atca frequencies .",
    "estimated uncertainties represent a combination of random noise and scale errors resulting from errors in the calibration . except at 8.6 ghz",
    ", the scale errors are estimated from the scatter in the measured flux densities of j0536 - 6918 since day 4000 . at 8.6 ghz ,",
    "j0536 - 6918 is outside the half - power radius of the primary beam , and scale errors are taken to be 1.25 times the 4790 mhz scale errors . at the lower frequencies and at later times , the errors in the flux density estimations are dominated by the scale errors . since , except at 8.6 ghz ,",
    "the flux density of j0536 - 6918 is comparable to that of snr 1987a and since there is no evidence for systematic changes in the flux density of j0536 - 6918 , these scale errors can be reduced by dividing the flux densities by the normalised flux density of j0536 - 6918 from the same observation .",
    "flux densities from day 3000 scaled in this way for 1.4 , 2.4 and 4.8 ghz are shown in figure  [ fg : scflux ] .",
    "these plots show that the continued increase in flux density observed at 843 mhz by ball et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is also observed at higher frequencies .",
    "the increase in slope observed at about day 2900 in the most data is also seen in the atca data ( fig .",
    "[ fg : fluxes ] ) .",
    "ball et al . ( 2001 ) stated that the most data after day 3000 were well fitted by a linear trend .",
    "however , we believe that there is significant evidence for an long - term increase in slope after day 3000 in both the most data set and the atca data sets , i.e. , the rate of increase in flux density is increasing .",
    "evidence for this is shown in fig .  [ fg : fluxvar ] which shows residual flux densities after fitting a second - order polynomial to the most and scaled atca flux densities from day 3000 and subtracting the linear component .",
    "these plots all show a systematic trend with the residual flux densities being , on average , negative at central times and positive at both early and late times . fig .",
    "[ fg : fluxvar ] also shows the second - order term of the fit which in all cases is positive and of about 3-@xmath25 significance .",
    "these data sets are essentially independent so there can be little doubt about the significance of the effect .    to further quantify this effect ,",
    "straight lines were fitted to the atca data sets from day 3000 , both for the unscaled data and for the data ( except at 8.6 ghz ) scaled by the flux density of j0536 - 6918 .",
    "results of this fitting are given in table  [ tb : grad ] .",
    "the second and third columns give the gradient and @xmath26-intercept of the lines fitted to all data between day 3000 and day 5100 ( cf .",
    "[ fg : fluxvar ] ) .",
    "the point of interest here is that there is a systematic increase of the date of intercept with frequency . especially for the higher frequencies ,",
    "the intercept is well after the date of first detection of the snr .",
    "this shows that the higher frequencies have a higher relative rate of flux density increase and that the present rate of increase is much higher than that at early times .",
    "note that this effect is seen in both the scaled and unscaled data , so it is not an artifact of the scaling procedure .    as a further check ,",
    "the data sets were split into two halves , from day 3000 to day 4050 and from day 4050 to day 5100 , and straight lines fitted to both halves .",
    "results are tabulated in columns 4  7 of table  [ tb : grad ] .",
    "the values of reduced @xmath27 for the combined fit were computed by treating the two lines as a single model describing the complete data set from day 3000 onward .",

    "in fact , the difference is typically small and of either sign , showing that there is no systematic curvature .",
    "the mean difference @xmath75 across the entire data set is @xmath76 compared to the rms fluctuation of @xmath77 .",
    "the observation that the relative flux density gradient is both greater and increasing more rapidly at the higher frequencies ( table  [ tb : grad ] ) implies a systematic change in the spectral index .",
    "figure  [ fg : si_time ] shows the computed spectral indices from 843 mhz to 8.4 ghz as a function of time . because of the uneven and non - simultaneous sampling at the different frequencies , spline curves were fitted to all data sets except that at 1.4 ghz .",
    "spectral indices were then computed by interpolating values at 843 mhz , 2.4 , 4.8 and 8.6 ghz to times when the 1.4 ghz flux density was measured , and fitting power - law spectra to flux densities .",
    "the interpolation was unreliable near the start of the data set for 2.4 and 8.6 ghz because of sparse data , so only three points were fitted there .",
    "apart from a few high points between days 1200 and 1400 near the start of the data set ( which have large error bars ) , there is a more - or - less steady increase in spectral index , corresponding to a flattening of the radio spectrum , throughout the whole data set .",
    "it is possible that the variation consists of step changes , with the most obvious step times being around day 3000 and day 4700 . at early times , the mean spectral index was about @xmath0 , but in the last year ( 2000 ) it was @xmath1 .",
    "the radio spectra are remarkably close to power law and show no sign of either positive curvature , as would be expected if either free - free absorption or synchrotron self - absorption were important , or negative curvature as is predicted by diffusive shock acceleration theories ( e.g. reynolds & ellison 1992 ) .",
    "the radio spectral index of about @xmath12 is considerably steeper than the canonical @xmath78 expected for synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated in strong shocks , for which the spectral index @xmath79 and the electron energy index @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the compression ratio in the shock ( jones & ellison 1991 ) . for high mach - number shocks in a monatomic non - relativistic gas , @xmath82 , giving @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "a steeper radio spectrum implies a steeper electron energy distribution and a smaller compression ratio in the shock ; @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "monte - carlo modelling of non - linear diffusive shock acceleration , including the dynamical effects of the accelerated particles ( e.g. baring et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggest that young and hence fast shocks have a _ larger _ compression ratio than older shocks , resulting in a flatter synchrotron spectrum .",
    "duffy , ball & kirk ( 1995 ) included the effect of accelerated ions on the shock structure and were able to model the observed spectrum with the shock expanding into a terminated stellar wind structure .",
    "however , this model predicts a declining brightness and a steepening spectrum for the radio emission , both of which are contrary to observation .",
    "the observed spectral index is also steeper than those for typical supernova remnants ; no snr in the green ( 2000 ) catalogue has a spectral index definitely steeper than @xmath88 and the mean spectral index for shell - type remnants is @xmath89 .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that the current flattening of the spectrum represents an evolution toward the typical index of @xmath78 . at the current rate",
    ", it will only take about 50 years to reach @xmath78 .",
    "the clump interaction model of ball & kirk ( 1992 ) predicts a declining flux density at later times .",
    "however , this model was based on only two clumps .",
    "the model could be extended to invoke interaction with an increasing number of clumps , maybe tens or hundreds at the present time .",
    "a more accurate description would involve a statistical hierarchy of effective clump sizes .",
    "this could account for both the gradient increase and the short - term fluctuations in the observed flux density .",
    "both radio and optical evidence ( e.g. spyromilio , stathakis & meurer 1993 , van dyk et al .",
    "1994 , spyromilio 1994 ) point to a clumpy circumstellar medium around other supernovae .",
