    "a knowledge of the corresponding characteristic energy scales @xmath16 and @xmath17 is essential for an understanding of the low - temperature properties of the compound .",
    "the nfl behavior dominates the thermodynamic and transport properties up to 10 k. notably , the electronic specific heat divided by @xmath8 exhibits a logarithmic increase upon cooling with a spin fluctuation temperature @xmath18  k.@xcite the corresponding entropy revealed a doublet ground state of the yb@xmath19 ions with a kondo temperature @xmath12 of approximately 17 k.@xcite the cef level scheme of ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 was determined from inelastic neutron scattering : the @xmath20 multiplet of the yb@xmath19 is split into 4 doublets at energies corresponding to 0 - 200 - 290 - 500  k , respectively.@xcite    the strong interplay between kondo effect and cef splitting manifests itself in the transport properties of the system .",

    "such behavior was confirmed for ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 by means of resistivity investigations under pressure:@xcite above 4 gpa , the single peak in @xmath22 splits into three separate maxima .",
    "the two maxima at lower @xmath8 were attributed to kondo scattering on the ground - state doublet with the onset of coherence and to kondo scattering on thermally populated cef levels .",

    ": for systems with a thermopower as described for ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 the anticipated behavior upon application of a small pressure or weak lowering of @xmath21 is the appearance of a low-@xmath8 shoulder . with further decreasing @xmath21 two separate minima",

    "as the kondo temperature is reduced by ni substitution on the cu site , a shoulder appears at low @xmath8 already for the lowest ni content studied ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , it remains unsolved , whether only a single minimum occurs , when the system is pushed to the hf regime for ni concentrations @xmath27 , or whether the appearance of the low-@xmath8 shoulder is directly related to the development of the hf state .",
    "ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 seems to be an appropriate system to address this problem , since it , being a hf metal , exhibits a single minimum in @xmath0 .    in order to change the effective coupling between the @xmath28 and the conduction electrons , substitution on all crystallographic sites has been realized in ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 , generally with the aim of lowering the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature .",

    "<S> the appearance of the low-@xmath8 extrema in @xmath0 and @xmath7 is attributed to the lowering of the kondo scale @xmath9 with decreasing @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the characteristic energy scales for both the kondo effect and the crystal electric field splitting @xmath11 are deduced . </S>",
    "<S> an extrapolation of @xmath12 to @xmath13 allows to estimate the kondo temperature of ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 to 29  k. for pure ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath14 lie within one order of magnitude and thus the corresponding extrema merge into one single feature . </S>"
