    "series of observational facts assembled over the past decade on active galactic nuclei have led to the so - called `` unified '' model of agn ( for a review of these facts , as well as for the detailed characteristics of the unified model see krolik 1999 ) .",
    "our current specific interest in the unified model is that the central engine ( black hole and accretion disk ) and its close environment ( dense gas clouds emitting the broad lines which constitute the broad line region , blr ) are embedded within an optically thick dusty / molecular torus . along some lines of sight ,",
    "the torus obscures and even fully hides the central engine and the blr .    in that respect ,",
    "the case of ngc1068 , a bright seyfert 2 active galaxy , is particularly enlightening .",
    "the spectrophotometry in polarized light reveals the presence of a hidden blr ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) , the conical shape of the narrow line region ( nlr )  both on large ( pogge 1988 ) and small ( evans et al . 1991 ) scales  indicates that the ionizing radiation is collimated by an opaque blocking torus and , finally , the symmetry center of the uv / optical polarization map ( capetti et al .",
    "1995 ) is found to be coincident with the radio core ( gallimore et al .",
    "1996a ) , the 12.4 @xmath0  peak ( braatz et al .",
    "1993 ) and the maser emission ( gallimore et al . 1996b ) , suggesting that this is the location of the hidden true nucleus .",
    "this object appears then particularly suitable for unveiling the putative torus through its infrared emission , which , according to current models should be quite strong ( _ e.g. _ pier & krolik 1992a , b , 1993 ; granato & danese 1994 ; efstathiou , hough & young 1995 ; granato , danese & franceschini 1997 ) . in this search ,",
    "high spatial resolution is a requisite in order to locate very precisely and to characterize the structure of emission sources .",
    "hence , adaptive optics ( hereafter abbreviated ao ) in the 1 - 5 @xmath0  window is the tool . at the distance of ngc1068  ( 14.4mpc ) , 1",

    "ngc1068  was observed in an imaging mode through the standard spectral l ( 3.48 @xmath0 ) , l ( 3.81 @xmath0 ) , and m ( 4.83 @xmath0 ) bands and through a circular variable filter for the pah ( line 3.3 @xmath0  rest wavelength , and continuum ) . through the l , l and m bands",

    "it was excellent during four nights , ranging from 0.4  to 0.7  .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of the ao correction was optimal and the images obtained with comic were diffraction - limited .",
    "however , the gain of the intensifier was not optimized at that time , which resulted in strehl ratios lower than expected .    in order to minimize position offsets between the calibration star and the agn , we selected a reference star within 2 degrees of the target . for both the galaxy and the point spread function ( psf ) reference star ,",
    "the air - mass was at most of 1.3 , ensuring differential refraction effects to be negligible ( less than one pixel ) .",
    "individual exposure times were chosen so as to observe under conditions of background limiting performances ( blip ) . in this way , the readout - noise is dominated by the background photon noise , and we just take an average of the images to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we observed several photometric standard stars to obtain a precise flux calibration and another star to determine the psf for later deconvolution .",
    "standard infrared data reduction procedures were applied to each individual frame , for both the galaxy and the reference stars : dead pixel removal , sky subtraction , flat fielding from sky images at each wavelength . as the ao system is compensates for image shifting , no additional shift correction was applied .    thanks to the length of our observing run",
    ", we obtained a largely redundant data set .",
    "we discovered in particular that we had experienced a problem of astigmatism during 2 nights , due to an unappropriate tuning of the visible wavefront sensor leading to a very low signal to noise ratio on the shack - hartmann analysor ( alloin & marco 1997 ) .",
    "being aware of this flaw , we decided to review in depth the ao optimization parameters for the entire data set and to remove all suspicious blocks .",
    "in addition , we applied a selection procedure of 32-images data cubes , based upon the seeing value and the strehl ratio .",
    "the corresponding equivalent integration times are reported in table [ data_ac ] .",
    "to better interpret the ngc1068  observations with adonis , we need to track precisely which visible image of ngc1068  is seen by the wavefront analysis sensor ( wfas ) in its evaluation of the ao correction .    in order to recover this information ,",
    "we have used hst images with 45 mas pixel size both in the continuum and in the lines ( f791w , f547 m f658n , and f502n ) , properly aligned and flux scaled to a same 1 sec exposure at the entrance of the telescope , to construct a composite image which mimics the one seen by the wfas .",
    "the image alignment was performed using point - like sources in the field of view , which allows a registration within 10mas ( tsetanov , private communication ) . the flux scaling has included corrections for the exposure time of each image and the mean hst camera efficiency over the corresponding filter .",
    "then , each of these corrected images has been weighted by the corresponding mean wfas wavelength response , before addition .",
    "we find indeed that the light received from ngc1068  on the wfas is largely dominated by continuum light and is not much weighted by the [ oiii]-line light distribution .    and finally , to mimic the image seen on the wfas ccd , from which the ao corrections are computed , we have degraded the hst composite image by a `` seeing '' effect of @xmath11  : this includes both an atmospheric effect ( @xmath10.6  according to the mean seeing value -fwhm- measured on the selected nights of the observing run ) and the instrumental spread function ( 0.85  ) , which is rather large because of the photocathode -ccd spacing . as the wfas takes into account , to compute the ao correction , the light centroid over a 6  circular diaphragm",
    ", we have derived the light centroid within a 6  aperture on the degraded composite hst image .",
    "this position is the reference for the wfas .",
    "we need also to locate the centroid of the degraded hst composite image with respect to the lynds visible peak , as measured from the hst image f547 m .",
    "we find a slight offset between the visible centroid and the lynds visible peak : the visible centroid ( using ngc1068  for the correction ) is located 99 mas to the n and 86 mas to the e of the lynds peak .",
    "this offset is taken into account in our estimate of the ngc1068  infrared sources location ( sect .",
    "the offset may differ from one ao system to another . in the case of adonis , the offset is largely due to the 6  entrance to the wfas .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ lmimage ] the l and m band images of ngc1068 .",
    "we used a magnitude ( log ) scale because of the high dynamics of the images provided by the ao .",
    "the images have been deconvolved using a lucy - richardson algorithm ( midas package ) .",
    "we have also observed ngc1068  in the l band : this image is very similar to the one obtained in the l band .",
    "thus , our current data analysis and subsequent discussion will be based on the two l and m bands , only .",
    "the l and m band images show :    \\i ) an unresolved core down to the resolution ( fwhm ) of 0.24  ( 16pc ) and 0.33  ( 22pc ) , respectively at 3.5 and 4.8 @xmath0 .",
    "this core has already been observed at 3.6 @xmath0  by chelli et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and at 2.2 @xmath0  by marco et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , thatte et al .",

    "( 1998 ) and is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the inner ionizing cone ( p.a.=15@xmath2 , evans et al . 1991 ) .",
    "it extends in total over @xmath180pc , with a bright spot at each of the @xmath1e  and @xmath1w  edges at a radius of @xmath125pc from the central engine .",
    "\\iii ) an extended emission along the ns direction , almost aligned with the radio axis and the ionizing cone axis . at low level isophotes ( in particular in the l band )",
    ", a change in the direction of the axis of this emission can be noticed , reminiscent of a similar change of direction of the radio jet ( gallimore et al .",
    "1996a ) .    down to faint levels",
    ", the 4.8@xmath0  thermal infrared emission appears to be extended over @xmath13  in diameter ( @xmath1210pc ) .",
    "it is striking that the two different ao systems used , adonis for the l and m bands and pueo for the k band , reveal a similar structure of the agn environment .",
    "these ao systems are using wfs of different types , shack - hartmann for adonis and curvature for pueo , as well as deformable mirrors of different types , piezo - stack for adonis and bimorph for pueo .",
    "the lucy - richardson deconvolution applied on both data sets uses psfs obtained in two different ways : we used an observed stellar psf in the case of the adonis data set  as the l and m band data are less sensitive to rapid psf fluctuations  and we used the psf recovered from the ao loop parameters in the case of the pueo data set .",
    "the two ao experiments differ in many aspects , while leading to a similar result for the structure of the agn dusty environment .",
    "therefore we are quite confident that this structure is real and not hampered by significant ao artifacts ( chapman et al .",
    "finally it should be noticed that the high resolution image of the agn in ngc1068  obtained in the k band with the ao system at the keck telescope _ ( www2.keck.hawaii.edu/realpublic/ao/ngc1068.html ) _ reveals a comparable structure , pending that a precise orientation and a scale be provided for the keck ao data set .      as it was not possible to observe simultaneously in the visible and in the infrared , we took advantage of a characteristic feature of ao systems which is to preserve the optical center for all objects : the infrared camera field has a position fixed in regard to the centroid of the visible counterpart of the object observed .",
    "indeed , by observing a star ( psf or photometric standard ) , we determine a reference position in the infrared image to within the precision we are aiming at in this study ( better than one infrared camera pixel , 0.1  ) .",
    "any offset of the galaxy infrared peak relatively to the star infrared peak would then reveal an intrinsic offset between the galaxy infrared light peak and the galaxy visible light peak .",
    "this is a method for positioning infrared versus visible sources in the agn .    to improve the precision ,",
    "we have fitted the psf and the ngc1068  emission peaks by gaussian profiles .",
    "the l and m band peaks in ngc1068  are coincident within the positional precision given above . we have also derived the position of this l and m peak in ngc1068  with respect to the visible peak , following the procedure described in sect .",

    "additional local heating processes , e.g. related to shocks induced by the jet propagation , might be at work as well along the ns extension .",
    "the latter suggestion stems from the conspicuous change of direction of the emission at 3.5@xmath0 , following that of the radio jet . indeed , kriss et al .",

    "fluxes at 3.5 and 4.8@xmath0  have been measured through circular apertures centered on the near - infrared peak , with a radius varying from 0.3  to 1.5  ( 22 to 100pc ) .",

    "1998 ) , as well as high resolution images obtained at 10@xmath0  ( alloin et al . 1999 ) , we have reconstructed the sed of the core emission through an 0.6  diameter diaphragm , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sed ] . therefore , this sed refers only to the central engine and its immediate environment ( including the inner parts of the dusty / molecular torus as well as some contribution from the ns extended structure ) . in this plot ,",

    "( 1998 ) , while this is not the case in the k band .",
    "the part of the near - infrared to mid - infrared emission which is arising from hot to warm dust grains can be represented by a series of grey - bodies of different temperatures and this summation is expected to result in a smooth distribution .",
    "yet , an emission bump at 2.2@xmath0 is observed , which could be interpreted as the unremoved stellar contribution in the k band , within the 0.6  diameter diaphragm . under this assumption , an upper limit of 75% for the stellar contribution to the flux at 2.2@xmath0 , can be derived .",

    "it is interesting as well to compare these 1996/1997 measurements in the infrared to those performed by rieke & low as early as 1975 .",
    "therefore , we have derived , for their 3  diameter diaphragm , the 1996/1997 observed fluxes at 1.25 , 1.65 ( both uncorrected for the stellar contribution ) , 2.2 , 3.4 , 4.8 and 10@xmath0 , from rouan et al .",

    "this magnitude offset is not expected to vary with time because it refers to the outer parts of the agn ( @xmath18 110 pc ) .",

    "the [ k - l ] color in the extended structures can be contaminated by some stellar contribution in the 2.2@xmath0  band . from grains at @xmath28@xmath1480k , which are the dominant contributors , we expect a [ k - l]@xmath36 color of 4.0 . given the observed [",
    "k - l ] value , we deduce that the pourcentage of the flux at 2.2@xmath0  which arises from the dust component ( with at most @xmath28@xmath1480k ) is of 30% . for this estimate ,",
    "we have not considered any correction for extinction .    how can the lack of [ l - m ] color gradient between the 0.6  diameter core and the extended structures be explained ? given the unresolved and intense core emission at 2.2@xmath0  ( fwhm = 0.12  from rouan et al .",
    "1998 ) it can be inferred that the hottest dust grains are extremely confined and located at a radius less than 4 pc . with l@xmath31",
    "= 8 @xmath34 erg s@xmath25 , they would be present only up to @xmath26 = 1.1 pc .",
    "hence , there must exist a very steep dust temperature gradient close to the central heating source .",
    "such a few parsec scale corresponds to a resolution which is well beyond that accessible at 3.5 & 4.8 @xmath0 .",
    "in fact the l and m emission we are measuring in an 0.6  diameter core is already strongly dominated by the warm grains .",
    "because of this suspected steep temperature gradient , the procedure applied previously to derive the stellar contribution in the 0.3  to 0.5  radius ring can not be used in the core .",
    "the mass of dust associated with the near - infrared emission can be estimated only in a rough way , as it depends on the ( unknown ) grain composition and grain size distribution . assuming graphite grains and following barvainis ( 1987 ) , the infrared spectral luminosity of an individual graphite grain is given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the grain radius , @xmath39 is the absorption efficiency of the grains , and @xmath40 is the planck function for a grain temperature @xmath41 . following barvainis ( 1987 ) , we take @xmath38=0.05@xmath0 and in the near - infrared , @xmath42 , @xmath43 leading to @xmath44=0.058 ( for the k band ) .",
    "because no [ l - m ] color gradient is detected towards the 0.6  diameter core , we consider the simple case of 2 populations of dust grains in that region , hot grains at t=1500k and warm grains at t=500k , matching the extreme values in that region .",
    "solving the equation @xmath45 for the three bands available , k , l and m , one derives 210@xmath46 and 910@xmath47 , for the number of grains at 1500k and 500k respectively , in the 0.6  diameter core .",
    "this indicates that there are @xmath1450 times more warm dust grains than hot dust grains in the 0.6  diameter core .",
    "the warm dust grains dominate the [",
    "l - m ] color . with a grain density @xmath48=2.26  g@xmath49 ,",
    "the mass of warm dust grains is found to be @xmath50(warm dust)@xmath10.5  @xmath4 .",
    "this mass is above that of hot dust grains detected in two seyfert 1 nuclei : 0.05  @xmath4 in the case of ngc7469 ( marco et al .",
    "1998 ) and 0.02  @xmath4 in the case of fairall 9 ( clavel et al .",
    "this result supports the fact that only a small fraction of the dust present in the torus is heated close to its sublimation temperature .",
    "in ngc1068 , like in other agn ( see for instance ngc7469 ) , dust is present also in the nlr region ( see fig . [ lmimage ] ) .",
    "it has been shown in sect .",
    "5 that the infrared emission in the l & m bands over the region @xmath51 pc follows a power - law . in addition",
    "the temperature of the grains deduced from the [ l - m ] color has been found to remain roughly constant with radius .",
    "thus , we can derive the radial profile of the warm grain number density in the nlr region , @xmath52 . under optically thin conditions , probably applicable in the nlr ,",
    "the brightness is directly proportional to the grain number density .",
    "then the observed brightness power - law leads to @xmath53=1.0 , suggesting a concentrated grain distribution ( a uniform grain density would correspond to @xmath53=0 ) . in ngc7469 ,",
    "the warm dust component led to a figure for @xmath53 around 1.5 ( marco et al .",
    "several torus models have been developed so far to explain the obscuration of the blr and uv / x - ray continuum sources along some lines of sight ( agn unification scheme ) .",
    "some of these models are generic , while others have been designed to match the case of ngc1068 .",
    "pier & krolik ( 1992a , b , 1993 ) propose a thick , parsec - scale , uniform density torus illuminated by a nuclear source .",
    "the dust can be heated up to the effective temperature of the nuclear radiation at the inner edge of the torus .",
    "they investigate models with effective temperatures between 500 k and 2000 k. such a model can explain the unresolved core observed at 2.2 , 3.5 and 4.8 @xmath0  with ao in the particular case of ngc1068 .",
    "does it explain the extended near infrared emission also revealed by these observations ?",
    "indeed , extended emission over 1  to 2  could result from reflected radiation from the torus and/or dust in the nlr .",
    "therefore , this model accounts for most of the features unveiled with high resolution imaging in the near infrared .",
    "efstathiou & rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) propose a model with a very thick tapered disk .",
    "they assume the melting temperature of all dust grains to be identical ( 1000k ) , but consider a radial distribution of the grain physical parameters ( size and chemical composition ) . in the case of ngc1068 ,",
    "efstathiou et al . ( 1995 ) have shown that the torus emission alone can not account for the total infrared emission .",
    "they attribute the excess infrared emission to a distribution of optically thin dust with @xmath53=2 in the nlr region .",
    "their model is in disagreement with the steep grain temperature gradient across the torus , which we infer to exist close to the central engine .",
    "conversely , the dust postulated to be present in the nlr by their model is indeed detected with the ao data set .",
    "granato & danese ( 1994 ) and granato et al . ( 1996 , 1997 ) developed a simple thick ( @xmath5430 ) torus model extended over several hundreds pc . to minimize the number of free model parameters , they have adopted a dust density distribution constant with radial distance from the nuclear source .",
    "but , they do not rule out the possibility , in the case of smaller values of the optical depth ( @xmath55=1.5 ) , that a more concentrated density distribution exist . their predicted size and shape for the near infrared emission are compatible with those derived through ao observations at 2.2 , 3.5 and 4.8 @xmath0 .",
    "a revised modeling of the agn in ngc1068  is timely , owing to the emergence of sub - arcsec resolution images in the near infrared ( ao techniques ) and in the millimeter range ( interferometric techniques ) , giving direct access to the dust and molecular environment of the central engine .",
    "the observation , for the first time at high angular resolution , of ngc1068  at 3.5 and 4.8 @xmath0  provides new informations to build a more realistic model of this agn under the current unification scheme . + as regard to the agn structure , we do observe : + ( i ) an unresolved core , already known at 2.2@xmath0  to have a size ( fwhm ) less than 8pc , and interpreted as the inner region of a dusty / molecular torus in which the central engine of ngc1068  is embedded , + ( ii ) along p.a.@xmath1100@xmath2 , an extended emission up to 40pc on either side of the core , particularly prominent at 4.8@xmath0 .",
    "this structure , also detected at 2.2@xmath0  up to 20pc on either side of the core , is coincident in p.a . with the parsec - scale disc of ionized gas detected with vlbi ( p.a.@xmath1110@xmath2 ) , and is found to be roughly perpendicular to the axis of the ionization cone in ngc1068 .",
    "we interpret it as the trace , up to a 40pc radius , of this dusty / molecular torus seen edge - on , + ( iii ) an extended emission along the ns direction up to 50pc from the core and with rather symmetrical properties on either side , both at 3.5 and 4.8 @xmath0 .",
    "again , this extended emission is detected , both at 2.2@xmath0  on a similar scale , and at 10 and 20 @xmath0  on a slightly larger scale .",
    "it reveals the presence of dust in the nlr , heated both by hard radiation within the ionizing cone and by shocks associated with the agn radio jet . + as regard to the dust temperature and dust distribution in the central arcsec of the nucleus , we get a final picture as follows . as close as @xmath26 @xmath11pc from the central engine , the dust is heated up to its evaporation temperature , 1500k .",
    "then the dust temperature declines very rapidly and reaches t@xmath1500k at @xmath56 28pc .",
    "the total mass of warm dust within a 22pc radius region is found to be around 0.5@xmath4 .",
    "it is observed as well that the near infrared flux of ngc1068 , in the 2.2 to 4.8 @xmath0  range , has increased by a factor two over some 20 years , while in the 10 @xmath0window the flux increase is only by a factor 1.2 .",
    "our results bring observational evidence of a dusty torus in the agn of ngc1068 .",
    "they further support agn modelling in the framework of the unification scheme : a thick torus surrounding a central engine ( black hole and accretion disc ) .",
    "although several models of the agn in ngc1068  are available , none matches in detail all the aspects of the current near - infrared results obtained at a subarsec scale .",
    "such new observational constraints make it both timely and exciting to run updated models .",
    "yet , we are aware that the most convincing and undisputable argument for the presence of the torus - like structure will come from a study of the kinematics of the gas within the 100 central parsec of ngc1068 .",
    "we expect such information to be soon obtained from isaac / antu observations on paranal ."
