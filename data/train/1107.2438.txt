    "one of the most important questions in quantum information theory is the classification of states containing inequivalent types of quantum correlations .",
    "many results exist in the case when the parts of the composite system are effectively distinguishable , but much less is known in the case of identical particles .",
    "when discussing entanglement at short scales , one can expect that indistinguishability of identical particles changes the nature of quantum correlations in a fundamental way .",
    "understanding such correlations and inequivalent types of entanglement of identical particles is also of great importance outside quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "following recent success in describing the algebra of polynomial invariants under the local unitary group of multipartite quantum systems in the limiting case of large hilbert space dimensions @xcite , in this paper we turn to the question of finding a similar description when identical particles are present .",
    "in the case of distinguishable subsystems one has a natural notion of local operations : these can be realized by acting on the parts separately .",
    "lack of distinguishability of particles , however , prevents one to apply this definition directly to identical particles , and indeed , the notion of entanglement in this case is not entirely settled yet and several different definitions exist @xcite . in this paper",
    "we regard unitary evolutions generated by hamiltonians built from single - particle observables as the analogue of local transformations as e.g. in ref .",
    "the state space is then of the form @xmath0 ( bosons ) or @xmath1 ( fermions ) , and a local transformation is described by the appropriate restriction of @xmath2 ( to be denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ) for some unitary operator @xmath5 acting on @xmath6 .    in some cases",
    "the physical setting provides a splitting of the single particle hilbert space into the direct sum of orthogonal subspaces .",
    "the most natural example is when the position of a particle can be localized in one of a few possible regions of space having vanishing or negligible overlap . in this situtation",
    "we may assume that the single - particle hamiltonian leaves the orthogonal subspaces fixed , and this further restricts the possible transformations leading to conservation of local particle numbers .",
    "finally , one may have to consider a quantum mechanical system where both bosons and fermions are present and the most general hilbert space obtained this way has the form @xmath7 on which the local unitary operations @xmath8 act where @xmath9 .",
    "note that the same hilbert space can also be interpreted as the state space of a system of @xmath10 types of particles where different types can be distinguished but particles of the same type are identical .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : luinv ]",
    "we introduce the object which we study , namely , the inverse limit of the algebras of invariant polynomials under products of unitary groups starting over any irreducible representation where the limit is taken as the dimensions tend to infinity . here",
    "we state that the inverse limit does not contain `` too many '' elements , that is every element is already represented for some finite values of the dimensions .",
    "section [ sec : symfunc ] summarizes some concepts related to the representation theory of the unitary groups and its connection to symmetric groups and their representations . in section [ sec : hilbser ]",
    "we derive a formula for the dimensions of the homogeneous subspaces of the inverse limit in terms of induced characters .",
    "section [ sec : mat ] prepares the detailed study of bosonic and fermionic systems by collecting some properties of regular bipartite graphs and integer stochastic matrices . in section [ sec : alggen ] we utilize these tools in the simplest nontrivial case : we describe invariants of pure states of a quantum system containing any number of identical bosons .",
    "the main result is stated in section [ sec : various ] which deals with the most general quantum systems containing different types of bosonic , fermionic or distinguishable particles in any combination .",
    "we find a convenient way of encoding elements of an algebraically independent generating set by certain graphs . in section [ sec : mixed ] we show that the problem of finding invariants of mixed states can be completely reduced to the case of pure states .",
