    "instantons in yang - mills theories at finite temperature have been extensively investigated in the past years .",
    "instantons at finite temperature , commonly called calorons , were firstly studied by harrington and shepard @xcite , who demonstrated the analytic description to the 1-instanton of @xmath5 gauge theory living in @xmath6 . the radius of the compact space @xmath7 is naturally interpreted as the inverse of the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the harrington - shepard caloron is constructed by locating the infinitely many bpst instantons @xcite along the one direction with the equal separation @xmath9 .",
    "the authors of @xcite start from the bpst instanton in the t hooft ansatz : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the index of @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the t hooft symbol and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the position and the size of the instanton , respectively .",
    "it can easily be shown that the anti - self - dual equation is enjoyed if the function @xmath16 obeys the laplace equation .",
    "hence the 1-instanton in @xmath6 is obtained by superposing the bpst instantons placed periodically along the @xmath17 direction with period @xmath18 . by scaling the size of each instanton @xmath19",
    ", one can perform the infinite sum in @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and we have taken @xmath24 for simplicity . therefore calorons are interpreted as the periodic instantons on @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , the harrington - shepard construction can not be applied to the general solutions including all the moduli parameters .",
    "this is because the t hooft ansatz does not contain all the moduli . to find the most general solutions",
    ", one needs to consider the nahm construction @xcite of calorons , which provides a strong scheme to study the structure of solutions or moduli spaces",
    ". a natural generalization of calorons are doubly periodic instantons on a torus @xmath1 . instantons on a torus , sometimes called torons , are studied in various contexts @xcite .",
    "sometimes problems in gauge theories are simplified when one considers non - linear sigma models that are recognized as the strong gauge coupling limit of the uv theories .",
    "actually , explicit constructions of instantons or calorons are possible in non - linear sigma models .",
    "for example , instantons of the sigma models in two dimensions have very simple structures .",
    "these two - dimensional instantons are called lumps .",
    "the lumps in the sigma models are studied in much detail @xcite , where the explicit construction of lumps , moduli space structure , and scattering process has been investigated .",
    "recently , the constituent structure of the lumps in the non - linear sigma models is studied @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is discussed that the lumps with twisted boundary conditions in compact spaces lead to the constituent structure .",
    "this type of structure of the lumps on @xmath26 is quite similar to the calorons in yang - mills theories with nontrivial holonomies , in which there appear monopole constituents of calorons @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to establish the systematic construction of bps lumps in supersymmetric non - linear sigma models on a torus @xmath1 for the arbitrary charge @xmath2 .",
    "the sigma model lumps with @xmath27 on @xmath3 are obtained by multiplying the charge-1 solution by @xmath2 times",
    ". we will show that the same is true even for the lumps in compact spaces .",
    "following the harrington - shepard philosophy , we will collect the lumps on @xmath3 aligned in two distinct directions and construct the explicit solutions on @xmath1 .",
    "we also demonstrate that the collections of infinitely many @xmath2 lumps on @xmath3 with various boundary conditions result in the solutions on @xmath1 with twisted periodic conditions .",
    "the solutions have appropriate pole structure and correct topological charge @xmath2 .",
    "we will also examine the modular invariance of the solutions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we define the model .",
    "we consider the supersymmetric @xmath0 model and the bps equation for lumps . in section 3 , focusing on the @xmath28 model , we give the constructive method to fabricate doubly periodic bps lumps on a torus starting from the charge-@xmath2 ones on @xmath3 .",
    "the modular invariance of the solutions will be studied .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the conclusion and discussions .",
    "in this section , we start from the @xmath29 supersymmetric @xmath30 $ ] sigma model in four dimensions . although supersymmetry is not essential for the construction of solutions , we embed the model into the superfield formalism .",
    "this is because one can easily generalize the model to the ones with other target spaces in the superspace formalism @xcite .",
    "another important point is that the supersymmetric property of solutions is necessary when one discusses the relations between the sigma model lumps and other solitonic objects in gauge theories .",
    "see footnote [ fn : susy ] .",
    "we follow the wess - bagger conventions @xcite .",
    "the space - time metric is given by @xmath31 .",
    "following the quotient construction of sigma - models @xcite , the lagrangian in four - dimensional @xmath29 superspace is given by @xmath32 where the chiral superfields @xmath33 are the fundamental representation @xmath34 of the global @xmath35 symmetry , @xmath36 is the @xmath37 vector superfield and @xmath38 is the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) parameter .",
    "the component expansion of the chiral superfield is given by @xmath39 while the the vector superfield in the wess - zumino gauge is @xmath40 in the following , we consider the bosonic part of the lagrangian .",

    ", we have the constraint for the the scalar fields , @xmath43 while the f - term condition is trivial .",
    "therefore the lagrangian is rewritten as @xmath44 since the gauge field does not have the kinetic term , it is eliminated by the equation of motion , @xmath45 next , we consider the bps equation for lumps which depends on the two - dimensional directions @xmath46 .",
    "the lumps are instantons in two - dimensional sigma models . in the following , we consider two - dimensional models though we started from four dimensions .",
    "the dimensional reduction from four to two dimensions is straightforward .",
    "the model becomes the two - dimensional @xmath47 @xmath0 model this @xmath47 @xmath48 sigma model is the world - volume effective theory of a 1/2 bps vortex in supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "it was discussed in @xcite that the 1/2 bps lumps in the supersymmetric sigma model are interpreted as the 1/4 bps instantons in supersymmetric gauge theories .",

    "we focus on the first condition .",
    "the solutions to the bps equation preserve a half of @xmath47 supersymmetry",
    ". therefore the lumps are 1/2 bps configurations .    in order to satisfy the constraint , it is convenient to consider the following field decomposition : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an @xmath58-component vector .",
    "then one easily finds that the bps equation becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the projection operator .",

    "the solution to the bps equation should be a holomorphic function , and it is required to be settled down to the vacuum asymptotically .",
    "when we take the base point ( vacuum ) condition @xmath73 , the 1-lump solution is given by @xcite @xmath74 the residue of the function @xmath75 associated with the solution is evaluated at the pole @xmath76 , giving the expected result @xmath77 .",

    "the two - dimensional supersymmetric sigma models are considered as the effective action of a vortex in supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "therefore the lumps on the compact spaces are interpreted as four - dimensional gauge theory instantons inside the vortex wrapping the compact spaces .",
    "we will explore this possibility in the future works .",

    "although , the generalization of our construction to @xmath0 with @xmath187 is straightforward , its dynamics would be different compared with the @xmath69 case as in the case of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the other time - dependent solutions , for example , the q - lumps @xcite on the torus can be constructed in the same way . lumps with fractional topological charges and their constituents in gauged sigma models @xcite and",
    "the other context @xcite have been studied .",
