    "several applications where wireless body area networks ( wban ) are deployed around the human body , reliable and low delay communication is of paramount importance because of the critical nature of the collected data ( e.g. heart rate , blood pressure ) .",
    "energy consumption is also key for the prolonged operation of the devices attached to the human body . for their communication",
    "needs these wbans usually employ radio frequency ( rf ) technologies that operate in the industrial , scientific and medical ( ism ) radio band .",
    "one of the dominant solutions is the ieee 802.15.4 standard that is engineered specifically for low power devices  @xcite .",
    "however , it is also possible to use the widely popular wireless lan ( wlan ) standard ieee 802.11  @xcite because of the readily available access point ( ap ) infrastructure .",
    "regardless of the specific wireless communication technology , when multiple sensors are deployed in the human body , a wban in a star topology is usually created so that all the on - body nodes communicate with a gateway for forwarding the collected data .",
    "[ fig : dual - rf - bcc - principle ] ( left ) depicts the organization of a wban in a star topology that is employed by practical systems  @xcite . although rf is the only practical mechanism to forward data in this scenario ,",
    "still several significant problems remain .",
    "rf signals suffer considerably from body shadowing in a highly variable way with respect to human body  @xcite .",
    "this makes communication between on - body nodes , and also off - body , very unreliable .",
    "this inherent unreliability of rf communication around the human body is a critical problem for several real - life applications .",
    "we discuss two emerging application scenarios here to motivate our system design .",
    "one example is vital sign monitoring where multiple nodes need to be deployed in several different places of the human body  @xcite .",
    "traffic is usually flowing in the uplink direction , i.e. from the wban nodes to the gateway .",
    "consider for example a human that has a node on the torso and one on the wrist for monitoring the heart rate . if this human is a patient lying in bed , then the rf link of the sensor on the torso might be completely blocked .",
    "however , it is possible that the node on the wrist can communicate perfectly with the gateway . or it can happen the other way around as fig .",
    "[ fig : dual - rf - bcc - principle](a ) indicates .",
    "since humans usually move frequently , any sensor can be potentially blocked and the data may not be communicated on - time to the gateway ( or it can be lost completely ) .    besides health monitoring , the other important application is real - time media entertainment . with the rising popularity of wearable devices ,",
    "it is even possible that high data rate video streams need to be forwarded from the human body ( uplink ) .",
    "one specific application example with downlink traffic , is audio streaming from a wifi access point ( ap ) to on - body earphones without wires  @xcite .",
    "in these two examples rf connectivity between the ap and the earphones / glasses might be unreliable leading to problems in the audio / video transmission .",
    "therefore , the optimal node on the body must be found and act as a relay in order to transmit the data to and from the wifi ap .",
    "this node can be for example a smartphone .    to address the problems identified in the aforementioned scenarios , in this paper we propose a novel wban architecture , a network layer ( nwk ) protocol that exploits the proposed architecture , and an optimization framework supported by an analytical performance model of the system . in our architecture that is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual - rf - bcc - principle](b ) , all the wban nodes on the human body are equipped with both rf and body - coupled communication ( bcc ) transceivers . when the rf link of a node is unreliable the node uses the bcc link for forwarding its data through the human body to a node with a better rf link .",
    "the rationale of this design choice is based on the extremely power - efficient bcc technology that can be used instead of rf communication .",
    "prototype bcc transceivers use simple baseband communication and have a very small form factor ( 1mm@xmath0 dye in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the proposed wban architecture with two transceivers on board a wban node is an economically and technically viable option for real - life applications .",
    "* contributions .",
    "* the contributions of this paper are :    * first , we propose a new cooperative wban architecture that employs two communication technologies namely bcc and rf .",
    "this architecture is orchestrated by a novel nwk relay selection protocol that identifies the optimal relay for forwarding the data off the body .",
    "the proposed scheme is unlike any existing relay selection protocols since two different communication technologies are used . *",
    "second , for each medium access control ( mac ) protocol of the rf and bcc subnetworks we develop accurate expressions of the delay and energy consumption as a function of specific protocol parameters .",
    "our novel contributions here include first the performance modeling of a nwk that concurrently uses two wireless mac / phy technologies .",
    "second , our model is a cross - technology model , i.e. it quantifies the impact of a specific parameter setting for one mac on the second and on the complete system .",
    "* third , we propose the use of the analytical performance models for further optimization of the duty cycling of the bcc transceivers and the retransmission strategy of the rf transceivers so that energy consumption and delay are minimized .",
    "* benefits . *",
    "the _ first _ advantage is that devices with a blocked rf link can use the services of the remaining nodes for forwarding their data to a gateway and improve thus the reliability of the data delivery .",
    "this idea is demonstrated with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig : dual - rf - bcc - principle](b ) while we have also outlined this generic architecture in  @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished with c1 .",
    "_ second _ , rf transmissions are reduced to the absolute minimum since wban nodes do not communicate with each other through the rf link .",
    "the benefit is that the rf link is carrying a reduced load and the interference to surrounding rf devices is also minimized  @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished with c1 .",
    "third _ advantage is that a node with an rf link that is not completely blocked , but operates inefficiently ( higher number of required retransmissions that increase delay and energy consumption ) , can communicate with other nodes through bcc and select another node for data forwarding .",
    "this is accomplished with c2 and c3 .",
    "our performance evaluation focuses on highlighting these benefits .",
    "performance is evaluated both through simulations and also through the use of real rf traces .",
    "results with ieee 802.15.4 rf traces interestingly support even more the need for our system in real scenarios due to the severity of human body shadowing .",
    "* paper organization . * the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "related work is presented in section  [ section : related - works ] . in section  [ section : system - architecture ]",
    "we provide an overview of the system architecture and in section  [ section : relay - selection ] we delve into the details of the relay selection and packet forwarding algorithm .",
    "section  [ section : modeling - approach ] presents the motivation and an overview of our performance modeling approach . in section  [ section : rf - radio - model ]",
    "we present the performance model of the rf network while in section  [ section : bcc - model ] we present the analytical model of the bcc network . the mac protocol optimization that further exploits the previous analysis",
    "is described in section  [ section : optimization ] .",
    "the performance of our system is evaluated with simulations and real measurements in section  [ section : experiments ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ section : conclusions ] we conclude this paper .",
    "in this paper we deal with the problem of optimizing data delivery from a wban to a gateway .",
    "the problem is challenging because communication between on - body and off - body nodes is very unreliable  @xcite . the most promising way to attack",
    "the problem is through cooperation between wban nodes  @xcite . with cooperation",
    "the nodes that aid in forwarding the data of other nodes are the _",
    "relays_. there is a plethora of works that focus on selecting the optimal relay in the general case of wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) by considering different optimization objectives , while fewer works have focused in wbans .",
    "_ the majority of research works investigated cooperation in wsns / wbans with the objective to minimize power consumption . _ in  @xcite the authors consider relay selection in wsns for minimizing the power consumption of individual nodes .",
    "they evaluate the impact of the sensor wake up schedules on the consumed power , and then they propose incentive mechanisms for participating in the cooperative network .",
    "this is an optimization approach that perceives the nodes as independent competing entities that may help each other for relaying data to a gateway .",
    "a number of authors investigated the impact of cooperation on the power consumption and lifetime of the complete wban introducing thus a more holistic approach  @xcite .",
    "in these two works the cooperating nodes communicate with each other through the rf links opportunistically when they can not reach the gateway .",
    "however , a particular node may still not be able to reach another on - body node . to combat these intermittent problems ,",
    "another parameter that was also investigated together with relay selection was power control .",
    "power control effectively means topology control in the wban  @xcite , i.e. we can allocate more power to nodes that need it so that they can reach the rest of the network or the gateway .",
    "even though this approach ensures optimal power allocation for given channel conditions , power may be wasted in nodes with poor rf links . in the category of research efforts that target power minimization",
    "we can not identify solutions that eliminate the problem of a completely blocked rf link , but rather state - of - art solutions that allocate optimally the system resources to combat the rf inefficiencies .",
    "this is still unacceptable in scenarios where data from a specific node must be transmitted in real - time to the gateway .",
    "another significant number of research efforts focused on the problem of reliable communication and was motivated from experimental results . in  @xcite",
    "the authors first focus on obtaining an experimental characterization of the channel . from the obtained results ,",
    "the use of statically assigned relay nodes in specific body locations was proposed .",
    "nevertheless , specific on - body nodes may still fail or be occluded due to body shadowing .",
    "another aspect that affects the wban performance is the mobility of the user .",
    "mobility models for wbans driven from experiments were studied in  @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors study the problem of user mobility and posture changes and how they affect wban performance .",
    "the solution is a multi - hop protocol that is aided by a single relay .",
    "in contrast to all the previous works that look into each specific node as a potential relay , there is an option to use multiple wban nodes for improving the reliability and/or energy / power .",
    "this class of protocols , that also targets generalized wireless cooperative networks , proposes the creation of _ clusters _ across groups of nodes in order to improve the diversity gain in the rf link by simultaneously transmitting the same information over different wireless paths  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is the major problem of node synchronization in this case . in cooperative schemes that involve many nodes we can also add recent works that apply advanced techniques like network coding  @xcite .    despite the architectural and protocol differences , all the previously described schemes share one common characteristic which is the use of a single rf communication technology .",
    "to alleviate the problems of a single technology two different ones can be used .",
    "the number of works in this area is quite limited .",
    "a communication protocol that uses two technologies was presented in  @xcite . in that work",
    "the authors proposed the use of two different rf bands namely the 433mhz and 2.4ghz .",
    "the 433mhz band is used for data aggregation whereas the 2.4ghz band is used for data forwarding to the gateway . since the range of the 433mhz band is limited to approximately 2 meters around the node it is possible to improve the reliability and energy consumption by reducing the number of nodes competing for the same channel .",
    "still , both links use rf for on - body communications and two independent rf bands are required .",
    "_ thus , all the techniques we discussed in the last three paragraphs can not address completely the rf reliability problem because of the fundamental problems of the wireless channel .",
    "_    finally , we should mention that none of the previous works employed an in - depth analysis of the impact of the mac protocol parameters on energy / delay / reliability of the complete cooperative network .",
    "we could only trace a limited number of works for non - cooperative systems that use analytical protocol performance models for further optimization .",
    "these approaches use the mac model of ieee 802.15.4 for power minimization at an individual node  @xcite .    when compared to all the related works , our approach is significantly different .",
    "it focuses on using simultaneously the most reliable and most efficient rf link ( in terms of delay / energy ) for data forwarding since these two aspects are intertwined .",
    "our solution consists of a new wban architecture and a novel cooperative protocol design that is supported by an analytical performance model . with our system",
    "even when at least one node has an active rf link the data from every wban node will reach the gateway . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no other wban system can guarantee that .",
    "we consider a wban that consists of @xmath1 nodes where each node is equipped with an rf transceiver and a bcc transceiver .",
    "these two hardware components use different mac / phy protocols and are both controlled from a specialized nwk protocol .",
    "the nodes are organized into a single - hop bcc network , and a subset @xmath2 of them form a single - hop rf network as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dual - rf - bcc - principle ] .",
    "all the nodes that are part of the rf network can connect to a gateway for forwarding the collected data .",
    "each wireless link has different delay / energy characteristics due to channel variations .",
    "while only @xmath2 nodes are part of the rf network , all the @xmath1 nodes participate in the bcc network .",
    "non - relay nodes transmit their packets through the bcc link to one of the relays , while the selected relay transmits wirelessly to the gateway the locally generated and forwarded data packets .",
    "nodes that do not have a relay responsibility are allowed to put into sleep mode the rf transceiver for reducing the energy consumption . however , since it is possible that in the future they assume the role of an rf relay , they wake up periodically , they transmit an rf packet , and after they receive a response they update the received signal strength indication ( rssi ) value of their rf link .",
    "the ieee 802.15.4 is used for rf communication . a non - beacon - enabled and un - slotted carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance ( csma / ca ) algorithm",
    "is assumed for channel access .",
    "all the nodes sense the channel status during the clear channel assessment ( cca ) slots .",
    "the basic idea of the un - slotted csma / ca algorithm is that backoff and packet transmissions are not aligned to specific slot boundaries .",
    "the un - slotted csma / ca operates as follows .",
    "each time a device generates a packet for transmission it waits for a random number of slots , called the backoff counter , ranging from 0 to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the backoff exponent . in ieee 802.15.4 , the backoff counter",
    "is decremented to zero regardless of the cca result and by default @xmath4 is initialized to 3 .",
    "when the backoff counter reaches zero , the device performs cca only once in order to check whether the channel is busy or not .",
    "if the channel is idle during the cca period that has duration @xmath5 ( fig .  [ fig : rf - mac - protocol ] ) , the device transmits its data packet .",
    "when the channel is busy during the period @xmath5 , the backoff exponent @xmath4 is increased by 1 and the random backoff procedure is repeated .",
    "the backslash - shaped blocks in fig .",
    "[ fig : rf - mac - protocol ] depict the increase in the backoff time after a failed cca .",
    "more details regarding its operation are provided later while the complete algorithm is available in  @xcite .",
    "bcc without requiring skin contact can be realized with two electrode transmitter / receiver devices capacitively coupled to the human body  @xcite .",
    "the transmitter generates a variable electric field while the receiver senses the variable potential of the body with respect to the environment .",
    "a signal attenuation of less than 70db has been measured between devices placed at various positions of the human body  @xcite .",
    "the human body channel is especially affected by interference below 1mhz while for higher frequencies the interference level is below -75dbm . in this paper a bpsk modulation scheme is assumed where the digital pulses are directly transmitted to the human body through the capacitive plates  @xcite .",
    "digital pulses of 1.2v for transmission are used , and an receiving band of 1 - 30mhz was chosen for improving the ber in the presence of interference .",
    "the ber was measured to be lower than @xmath6 for the aforementioned conditions .",
    "the energy efficiency of the transceiver was measured at 0.32nj / bit . since the design of the phy is not the focus of this paper we do not delve into further details .",
    "the interested reader can find more details about a typical prototype transceiver in  @xcite .    regarding the mac layer it is a protocol that employs the well - known concept of low power listening ( lpl )  @xcite .",
    "lpl exploits a specialized _ wake up receiver _ hardware that is always in active mode and consumes very little energy while the main receiver is deactivated .",
    "[ fig : bcc - mac - protocol2 ] presents the channel access scheme for a single packet .",
    "a preamble packet is always transmitted before the transmission of an actual data packet which means that nodes contend with preambles .",
    "the contention for the transmission of preambles follows the same backoff procedure with the rf mac .",
    "nodes that are asleep can wake up with the preamble and prepare for the actual data reception .",
    "the preambles contain the destination address so that they wake up the appropriate node .",
    "when a preamble is successfully received , the node that wakes up sends an acknowledgment packet that is named _ ready - to - receive _ ( rtr ) since it also serves as an indication that the receiver can accept the actual data packet . after this transmission",
    "the receiver waits for the data packet to arrive and transmits the final ack .",

    "the first and main task of our distributed wban system is to calculate the optimal subset of @xmath2 rf relays from all the available nodes , while the second task is to forward the data through the optimal relay if needed . to accomplish the first task , our system is designed as follows .",
    "each wban node @xmath10 calculates the average delay and energy of the direct rf transmission and then it informs the remaining nodes in the network .",
    "the random variables of the delay and energy are denoted as @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "this functionality will be analyzed in subsections  [ subsection:1 ] and  [ subsection:2 ] .",
    "how this information is used for selecting a node as a relay will be examined in subsection  [ subsection:3 ] .",
    "the process of making the actual forwarding decision is described in  [ subsection:4 ] .",
    "all this functionality is concisely captured in the pseudo - code of fig .",
    "[ fig : coop - protocol ] .    in the pseudo - code of fig .",
    "[ fig : coop - protocol ] we introduce two specific _ control _ messages at the nwk , namely @xmath13 for broadcasting the parameter estimates , and second @xmath14 that is used for relay selection .",
    "a summary of the most important functions that are used by our protocol stack are provided in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "finally , our protocol defines three data structures at each node in the form of linked lists , and are denoted as @xmath15 while their use will be explained in the next subsections .",
    "the parameter estimation and information exchange functionality is captured in the function param_est_node ( ) in the pseudo - code of fig .",
    "[ fig : coop - protocol ] and is executed periodically every @xmath16 seconds by every node . when an rf node is not a relay , the rf transceiver is deactivated by entering an idle state  @xcite and so it has to enter an active state to execute this function .",
    "the channel estimation itself is a local task at each rf node that is executed by default in ieee 802.15.4 for every received packet and so no extra overhead is introduced by our scheme ( i.e. when param_est_node ( ) is invoked it reads the latest rssi measurement from the related register of the micro - controller ) .",
    "next , this measurement is used for calculating the average delay and energy that are denoted as @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] respectively ( the expectation of these random variables ) .",
    "this is accomplished by using the rssi measurement in the analytical model that we develop in sections  [ section : rf - radio - model ] and  [ section : bcc - model ] .",
    "next , node @xmath10 broadcasts the rf link performance estimates expressed though the average delay @xmath17 $ ] and average energy cost @xmath19 ^ 2/ e_{rem}(i)$],^2/ e_{rem}(i)$ ] .",
    "this is a simple metric but it captures the fact that the cost is increased as the remaining energy is reduced after continuous utilization , while if the energy of a single transmission is low then this has an impact on lowering the cost .",
    "our framework can support different and potentially better cost functions . ] with the special message @xmath13 .",
    "this message is transmitted at the bcc link and is broadcast which means that all the bcc transceivers of all the nodes will receive it .",
    "this concludes the description of the core functionality of the parameter estimation and information exchange functionality of our system .",
    "next we discuss some important details .    *",
    "robustness of status_bcc transmissions .",
    "* the bcc phy offers a proven reliable link since it transmits with bpsk modulation and in addition it uses channel coding for eliminating bit errors  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath13 messages are sent with a constant period @xmath16 even when the channel does not change . in case of a packet loss",
    ", this periodic propagation of information allows all nodes to reach the same consistent state .    * communication overhead . *",
    "the forwarding of this information through the bcc link consumes a fraction of the bcc data rate .",
    "here we provide a simple analysis to demonstrate that this communication overhead is negligible for the bcc link .",
    "every @xmath16 the @xmath1 nodes transmit a @xmath13 message of length @xmath20 bits . and",
    "in the ( unrealistic ) worst case every @xmath16 all the current @xmath2 relays will also send a message @xmath14 in order to change their role .",
    "then the bcc data rate overhead is @xmath21 bps . for a typical update frequency of @xmath16=1 sec , and a payload of @xmath20=20 bytes for these short control messages , @xmath1=@xmath22 , and @xmath2=@xmath23",
    ", we have an overhead 2.4kbps which is negligible for the bcc phy of 10mbps .",
    "the advantage of our system is that the bcc link offers highly reliable , low - energy , and high - data rate communication  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the control messages that are exchanged across the different nodes and pass through the bcc link are more efficient in terms of both energy / bit and delay / bit when compared to rf .",
    "* frequency of channel estimate propagation .",
    "* when the rf channel changes rapidly , more frequent updates will be required since they will affect the relay selection . instead ,",
    "when the channel is fairly static , the relay nodes will change in larger time scales .",
    "this is an important aspect that is a general problem that presents itself in wireless communication systems . in this paper",
    "we evaluate this aspect in our performance evaluation section .      while collecting the information and broadcasting it is an important task , it is also critical to ensure that the incoming information at a node is properly processed .",
    "this functionality is implemented in the rx_status_bcc ( ) function of the pseudo - code in fig .",
    "[ fig : coop - protocol ] .",
    "this function is invoked when a new @xmath13 message is received . in this case",
    "this function first re - sorts the two linked lists named @xmath24 and @xmath25 that contain all the @xmath1 network nodes according to the delay and energy estimates of their rf links .",
    "next we explain why this simple message processing approach is enough .",
    "* exploiting the mac for serializing information updates .",
    "* the @xmath13 messages are transmitted and processed sequentially by all nodes and this ensures consistent and reliable flow of information in the network .",
    "[ fig : example - status - bcc - message ] has an example with five nodes that will clarify how these messages are processed .",
    "assume that the nodes start from the same consistently order lists @xmath24 and @xmath25 shown in the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : example - status - bcc - message ] .",
    "assume now that node 2 measures a local change in the rf performance .",
    "from the last known state shown in the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : example - status - bcc - message ] , it knows its new position in the list @xmath24 that it now updates locally .",
    "then , it broadcasts a @xmath13 .",
    "the transmission of this message is naturally serialized by the bcc mac in the sense that if there are more updates from other nodes they will be transmitted sequentially .",
    "thus , this list will be updated only once for every @xmath13 message transmission and all nodes make this update simultaneously .      at this stage of our system description",
    "we have explained how all the necessary information is being updated .",
    "now the actual relay selection decision is carried out in the second part of the function rx_status_bcc ( ) . in lines 4 - 8 of the pseudo - code node @xmath10 checks how many nodes perform better than itself in terms of delay and energy costs .",
    "a relay node drops the role of being a relay if it estimates from these measurements that either its delay or energy performance of the rf link is worse from more than @xmath2 ( nodes that are allowed to be relays at all times ) .",
    "if this is the case it means that at least @xmath2 nodes have better performance characteristics depending on the delay or energy optimization objective .",
    "the node releases the token by transmitting a message @xmath14 to the currently best non - relay node in list @xmath24 ( lines 11 - 12 ) .",
    "similarly , in the case that a node estimates that it should become a relay , but currently it is not a relay , it waits for the broadcasted token that will be released in the way we explained before ( lines 14 - 16 ) .",
    "the rx_token_bcc ( ) function is responsible for processing the @xmath14 messages . when this message is received by the appropriate node , it starts this new relay role .    *",
    "robustness of token_bcc transmissions . * [ subsection:4 ] @xmath14 messages are transmitted reliably , i.e. all nodes ack the packet . since a token is acknowledged by the new relay , the `` old '' relay that releases it , and the remaining network nodes , know that the transaction was executed .",
    "thus , all nodes know exactly which node is a relay and which is not .",
    "note also that the transmission of tokens is also serialized in the bcc network which means that a new token is released when the last transaction is successfully completed .      at this stage in describing our system",
    "we have explained how it creates a list of the best relays .",
    "now the task of node @xmath10 is to check if packet forwarding through relay node @xmath26 should take place and this task is executed at the network layer by the function tx_data_nwk ( ) . when the application layer ( appl ) wants to send a packet it does so with this function that is executed on demand .",
    "this is where the algorithm determines if the bcc or the rf links will be used . in the pseudo - code in fig .",
    "[ fig : coop - protocol ] , the condition for forwarding data through a relay @xmath26 is that the expectation of the energy cost of the local rf transmission denoted as @xmath18 $ ] , must be higher than the energy cost of the combined use of the bcc link and the rf link of the relay @xmath26 : @xmath27 \\geq \\mathbb{e}[e_{bcc}]+ \\mathbb{e}[e_{rf}(n)]^2/e_{rem}(n)\\ ] ] the forwarding condition can also be formulated in terms of the delay and be expressed as @xmath28 \\geq \\mathbb{e}[d_{bcc}]+\\mathbb{e}[d_{rf}(n)],\\ ] ] or the forwarding decision can be based on a combined metric ( e.g forward only when both the delay and energy of the relayed transmission is better ) . in the previous expressions , @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 $ ] denote the expectation of the random variables of the energy and delay for one packet transmission in the bcc network .",
    "expressions and are evaluated by the main loop of the packet forwarding algorithm depicted in function tx_data_nwk(k ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : coop - protocol ] . in this function ,",
    "the loop checks first the best relay node that is contained in the list @xmath31 , and if the condition is satisfied , then the message is forwarded to it . otherwise ,",
    "if the condition is not satisfied by the best relay then we employ direct rf transmission since all the remaining relays will have worse energy transmission cost .",
    "* motivation . * in the previous section we explained that the rf relays are selected based on their delay and/or energy efficiency by using information that is distributed in the wban .",
    "if a node simply measures the average delay in the rf link and reports it to the wban , this does not account for the time consumed in retransmissions and channel access failures .",
    "the same is true for the bcc link .",
    "thus , a node needs to precisely account for the previous parameters in order to decide if it will use forwarding through bcc or not . therefore ,",
    "before an actual forwarding decision is made by a node it must know that this is indeed the optimal course of action . _ to accomplish that we develop not a cross - layer , but a same - layer and cross - technology performance model of the two mac / phys that are controlled by the nwk",
    ". _    * traffic assumptions . * throughout this section we consider applications where a node @xmath26 generates locally and asynchronously data packets with an poission rate of @xmath32 packets per second . thus , we adopt an m / g/1 queueing model for modeling the random variables of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the rf and bcc networks respectively .",
    "several works that we reference in our subsequent analysis use a similar approach for capturing the service behavior of csma / ca algorithm .",

    "based on the number of required execution cycles , we used the additional delay and power consumption of the micro - controller in that mode .",
    "so in this way we include both communication and computational energy and delay costs .",
    "* results . * in our results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : real - traces ] we see the average packet delay for different @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to note that even when both nodes are assumed to be used simultaneously , helping each other as the baseline system we defined earlier ( this system here is denoted as `` rf relay '' ) , this is not always the optimal case even when compared with just `` torso '' and `` pocket '' .",
    "the reason is that there is significant body shadowing between the node in torso and the node in the pocket and so there is significant packet loss that has to be compensated with higher number of retransmissions .",
    "energy and delay results follow a similar trend in fig .  [",
    "fig : real - traces](b ) . regarding the plr , when @xmath66 is increased this is decreased as fig .",
    "[ fig : real - traces](c ) indicates .",
    "the proposed system reaches perfect plr because the best link is selected and there is no need for many retransmissions .",
    "finally , we also evaluated the impact of a slower frequency for propagating rf channel estimates .",
    "we measured all the previous parameters and we only present delay in fig .",
    "[ fig : real - traces](d ) .",
    "this higher update frequency mainly affects the `` rf relay '' system because it makes suboptimal rf relay decisions .",
    "our system is affected with a difference that is barely noticeable .",
    "of course for an even slower update frequency of more than 10 seconds , we observed that similarly the performance of all systems was becoming proportionally worse .",
    "an interesting detail is that the used traces consider backlogged traffic at each node which is inconsistent with the poisson assumption used in our performance model .",
    "thus , the performance improvement clearly shows that our approach is not limited by the traffic model and it can work under more general settings .",
    "in traditional rf - based wbans in the face of body shadowing there is a fundamental tradeoff : either consume more energy for retransmissions or channel coding in order to increase reliability and suffer also higher delay , or reduce delay and energy at the cost of reduced reliability .",
    "however , we demonstrated that the above does not have to be the case if nodes cooperate through a delay / energy - efficient secondary link ( in this case bcc ) in order to select the most efficient rf link for forwarding wban data to a gateway .",
    "the performance gains are materialized not only with the novel wban architecture , but also with a nwk protocol that uses an algorithm for rf relay selection and packet forwarding driven by a performance model .",
    "furthermore , the cross - technology performance models are exploited for local optimization of the mac parameters of the protocols that operate in the bcc and rf subnetworks .",
    "the performance results indicate that the proposed system is more efficient than a state - of - the - art scheme in terms of energy and delay under different realistic channel conditions , application loads , and performance constraints .",
    "the potential concern regarding the proposed system is the need for two different technologies .",
    "however , existing ic technology already allows the integration of multiple transceivers in a single chip .",
    "our future work will be focused first on the optimal configuration of other system parameters like the number of used relays and the content of the transmitted packets .",
    "next , we intend to investigate the potential benefits of the proposed system when it is used with an ieee 802.11 rf communication link for multimedia transmission scenarios .",
