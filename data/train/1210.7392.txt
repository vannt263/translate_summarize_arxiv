    "it is well known that under extreme conditions a crystalline material may undergo a structural transition to a phase which remains effectively stable upon returning to standard thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the existence of such phases , polymorphism in compounds and allotropy in elemental crystals , results in materials with differing electrical and optical properties , such diamond and graphite .",
    "polytypism is a particular case of polymorphism in which the coordination number does not change .",
    "for example , iii - v and group - iv semiconductors can crystallize in their non - naturally occurring polytypic phase while maintaining their tetrahedral coordination@xcite .",
    "for example , iii - v semiconductors can crystalize in either the zincblende ( zb ) phase or the hexagonal wurtzite ( wz ) phase . under extreme conditions cubic diamond ( cd )",
    "transforms to a hexagonal wurzite crystal , known as lonsdaleite ( ld ) .",
    "the form of diamond was not discovered until 1967 when it was found in a meteorite@xcite .",
    "it was synthesized soon thereafter@xcite and is now believed to be the hardest known substance@xcite .    the high pressure phases of si and ge have been investigated@xcite and it has been determined that both undergo a series of structural phase transitions from cubic , to @xmath1-sn , to simple hexagonal , to an orthohombic phase , to hexagonal closed packed , to a face centered cubic phase@xcite . on the other hand , iii - v semiconductors typically crystalize either in @xmath1-sn , nickeline ( nias ) or rocksalt structures when subjected to high temperature and pressure@xcite .",
    "more recently , the growth of wz phase bulk gaas was achieved under extreme conditions @xcite .",
    "extreme temperatures and pressure are not the only ways to achieve wz or ld growth .",
    "laser ablation have been used to synthesize stable ld phase si @xcite iii - v nanowires tend to crystalize in the wz phase@xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to various factors such as the small nanowire radii @xcite , growth kinetics@xcite , interface energies@xcite and electron accumulation at the catalyst s interstitial site @xcite .",
    "it is now believed that the tendency of nanowires to crystalize in wz / ld phase may be true for group - iv semiconductors as well@xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally found that si nanowires with a radius in excess of 10 nm tend to crystalize in the ld phase @xcite and a number of recent theoretical investigations have confirmed that the hexagonal ld phase is the more stable for si nanowires exceeding certain critical dimensions@xcite .",
    "similar structural phase transitions are expected for ge nanowires as well @xcite .",
    "semiconductor nanowires have attracted much interest due to their potential applications such as photovoltaic cells@xcite , nano - mechanical resonator arrays @xcite , thz detectors @xcite , single photon detectors@xcite , field - effect transistors@xcite , single - electron transistors , and other devices@xcite .",
    "in addition , the quasi 1-d nature of nanowires allows materials with large lattice mismatches to be combined to form hetrostructures that are not possible in planar structures .",
    "the design and characterization of such devices requires an understanding of the electronic and optical properties of wz / ld phase semiconductors .",
    "even though bulk ld phase si , ge and diamond have been synthesized in the laboratory , their electronic structure still remains experimentally unverified .",
    "since these materials may be used for spin based devices , spin - orbit interactions should be included . the band structures and dielectric functions for ld phase diamond ,",
    "si and ge has been calculated using empirical pseudopotentials @xcite , however these calculations were done without the inclusion of spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the bandstucture of ld phase diamond si and ge have also been calculated using density functional theory @xcite , however these methods have well known shortcomings in predicting energies of excited states . therefore , there is a need for accurate empirically based band structures including spin .    in this paper",
    ", we first present bulk electronic band structure calculations for diamond , si and ge in the ld phase using empirical pseudopotentials with the inclusion of spin - orbit interactions .",
    "these calculations are based on transferable model pseudopotentials assuming an ideal ld structure .",
    "the spherically symmetric ionic model potentials are first obtained by fitting the calculated bulk energies of the cubic polytype to experiment .",
    "the band structure of the ld polytype is then obtained by transferring the spherically symmetric model pseudopotentials to the ld crystal structure .",
    "these model potentials are expected to be transferable between polytypes due to the similarities in their crystal structures . like the cubic structure , the ld structure is built from tetrahedrons of the same atom but are stacked differently . in both structures all of the nearest neighbors and",
    "nine out of the twelve second nearest neighbors are at identical crystallographic locations @xcite and all the second nearest neighbors are equidistant .",
    "hence the local electronic environment should be very similar in both polytypes .",
    "this method has proven to be quite successful in obtaining the bulk band structures of various semiconductor polytypes in the past@xcite .",
    "we have used this method to predict the band structures of wz phase iii - v semiconductors@xcite and our calculations are in excellent agreement with experiment for the cases for which the wz band gaps are known ( namely gaas , inp and inas ) . since then , a number of recent experiments have provided further conformations of the predicted band gaps ( and their respective symmetries ) @xcite and the effective mass of inas@xmath2@xcite .",
    "we have also calculated the dielectric functions for diamond , si and ge in the ld phase in the linear response regime within the electric dipole approximation for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the c - axis of the crystal .",
    "these calculations are in part motivated by recent experimental results showing that the photoluminescence(pl ) intensity in nanowires is strongly polarization dependent @xcite , including si nanowires@xcite .",
    "nanowire polarization effects can arise from the dielectric mismatch at the wire surface @xcite , electron - hole recombination selection rules @xcite , as well as from the underlying wz - type crystal structure@xcite .",
    "the dominant effect could be more easily identified if the optical dielectric functions for these semiconductors were easily available .",
    "however , experimentally measuring optical dielectric functions for ld phase semiconductors is difficult due to the extreme conditions required for growing bulk samples .",
    "our dielectric function calculations are carried out within the one - particle picture .",
    "much has been done in recent years to include the effects of two particle contributions ( such as electron - hole interactions ) in the dielectric function @xcite . in the case of _ first principles _ calculations , this improves agreement with experiment for the low energy part of the optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to the dielectric function comes from one - particle calculations , which by itself tend to be in good agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "moreover , while two - particle corrections improve _ ab - initio _",
    "dielectric functions@xcite , empirical methods include some two - particle effects through their fit to the experimental data ( which includes such effects ) .",
    "typically , dielectric functions calculated using epms are in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "the required momentum matrix elements , required for our calculations , are obtained from the pseudopotential wave functions . in general ,",
    "momentum matrix elements for pseudopotential calculations need to be corrected for the missing the core states .",
    "such corrections are typically done using nonlocal terms @xcite , which can also account the exchange and correlations effects as well@xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "nonlocal effects are included in the form of spin orbit interactions only .",
    "another problem with _ ab - initio _ dielectric function calculations is that @xmath3 is often overestimated@xcite .",
    "this is then improved upon by the inclusion of local field effects @xcite such as electron - phonon interactions , which typically affect the low frequency part of the dielectric function ( terahertz regime ) . however",
    ", this is not necessary in our case since local field effects shift the peak positions@xcite .",
    "the epm includes such effects through the fitting to experiments which necessarily include the effects .",
    "we instead adopt a simpler approach to take the missing core states and local field effects into account .",
    "we correct the static dielectric function , @xmath3 , for the unknown polytype by making use of the _ known _ @xmath3 of the cubic phases of diamond , si and ge .",
    "first , the optical dielectric functions for these cubic group - iv semiconductors are calculated .",
    "the optical sum rules are then used to obtain a set of constants which normalizes the calculated cubic @xmath3 to their respectively known experimental values .",
    "since the constituent element of each polytype is the same , corrections to account for the missing core states should be nearly the same and transferable between polytypes .",
    "these normalization constants are then used to correct @xmath3 for the unknown polytypes(ld ) , which therefore also corrects the ld phase dielectric functions as well . unlike calculations involving local field effects",
    ", our simple approach fixes @xmath3 without shifting peak positions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : epm ] outlines the empirical pseudopotential method , followed by a description of both the cubic and hexagonal band structures , and a discussion of the respective symmetries of the two polytypes in section [ sec : bands ] .",

    "finally , we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use the empirical pseudopotential formalism of cohen and chelikowsky @xcite .",

    "the nearest neighbors are the same in the two polytypes ( due to their tetrahedral symmetry ) , and nine of the twelve next nearest neighbors are in identical positions in both crystals and the remaining three next nearest neighbors are equidistant .",

    "for example at the @xmath65 point the point group operations must be followed by a translation @xmath75 .",
    "the ld crystal structure has lower symmetry than the cubic diamond structure , and the so interaction leads to additional lifting of orbital degeneracies . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , the hexagonal crystal field of ld",

    "[ fig : wz - c]-[fig : wz - ge ] .",
    "the electronic band structures are calculated in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "the ld band structure is more complicated its cd counter part due to its lower crystal symmetry . for a given energy range , there are roughly twice as many bands for the ld phase .",
    "the points , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , are special points where the energy levels stick together because the structure factor is zero there .    due to the similarities of the two crystals",
    ", many of the high symmetry points in the brillouin zones of cubic and ld have a one - to - one correspondence with each other ( just as in the case of zb and wz ) .",
    "this one to one correspondence is particularly useful in interpreting their respective band structures .",
    "the volume of ld s first brillouin zone is about half of that of its cubic counter part .",
    "therefore , if one were to take an intersection of the two brillouin zones such that each of their @xmath65-points conincide , then the @xmath72-point in the cubic structure also coincides with the @xmath65-point in ld @xcite .",
    "thus , in the free electron model , the zone center ld / wz energies can be directly predicted from the cubic @xmath65 and @xmath72 point energies . in single group notation ( absence of so interactions ) , the cubic @xmath78 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 states correspond to @xmath78 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively in ld .",
    "however , the presence of the crystal potential will perturb the exact one to one correspondence of the high symmetry point energies .",
    "because of this zone folding of the @xmath72-valley , indirect gap cubic materials with an @xmath72 valley conduction band minima could be expected to have a direct gap in the ld phase ( unless the energy of that state was significantly shifted by the crystal potential )",

    "their estimated band gap from lda calculations ( with corrections ) was about @xmath113 ev .",
    "the ld band gap for diamond is also significantly smaller than its cubic phase band gap of @xmath114 ev .    in the case of the ld phase si ,",
    "the calculated band gap is @xmath115 and the band minima is at the @xmath73-valley .",

    "it has a @xmath117 conduction band minima .",
    "the @xmath117 symmetry is due to the fact that cubic phase ge has a conduction band minima at the @xmath72 valley , which folds over to @xmath117 in the hexagonal phase .    with the inclusion of so interactions for ld , the top three valence states are typically ( in order of decreasing energy ) @xmath86 , @xmath84 , @xmath84 ( normal ordering)@xcite or @xmath84 , @xmath86 , @xmath84 ( anomalous ordering ) which results from a negative spin - orbit energy .",
