    "observations of diffuse gamma - ray emission from the galactic plane give us some knowledge on galactic cosmic - rays , interstellar medium and interaction between them .",
    "the observed features , most recently by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory , are described fairly well by a model based on dynamic balance and realistic interstellar matter and photon distributions ( hunter et al .",
    "1996 ) .    however , the observed intensity exceeds the model prediction by as much as 60% for energies above about 1 gev .",
    "one of the possible explanation of this discrepancy is that the theory of diffuse gamma - ray production may not be adequate at high energies : astrophysical gamma - rays above 1 gev have never been measured before with high statistical accuracy ( hunter et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "there are three basic components for the production of galactic diffuse gamma - rays : nuclear interactions between cosmic - rays and matter , bremsstrahlung collisions between electrons and matter , and inverse compton scattering of electrons with low - energy photons . above about 200 mev , the first component , more specifically the gamma - ray production from the decay of neutral pions produced in cosmic - ray ( protons and nuclei ) collisions with interstellar matter , is known to be the dominant one .",
    "previous works on this component used isobaric models and scaling models for the nuclear interaction : see dermer ( 1986a ) for detail .",
    "these studies , however , were focused on lower energies .",
    "this is natural since the gamma - ray spectrum from pion decay has a peak around 70 mev and drops rapidly toward higher energies . in order to compare the observed high - energy diffuse gamma - ray emission with model predictions , however , it is necessary to use more detailed models which describe high - energy proton - proton ( @xmath1-@xmath1 ) collisions more accurately . here",
    "we use monte carlo event generators that are commonly used in the analysis of high - energy physics experiments to simulate such collisions .",
    "we apply these results for the calculation of the galactic diffuse gamma - ray flux from cosmic - ray interactions up to @xmath2 gev and compare it with previous studies and data from the egret detector .",
    "the gamma - ray production source function from nuclear interaction , or the gamma - ray spectrum resulting from pion decay in @xmath1-hydrogen atom collisions , is given by stecker ( 1970 ) @xmath3 where the cosmic - ray proton flux is denoted by @xmath4 [ @xmath5s@xmath6sr@xmath6gev@xmath6 ] , @xmath8 is the differential cross section for the production of a @xmath9 with kinetic energy @xmath10 in the galactic ( rest ) system due to a collision of a cosmic - ray proton of kinetic energy @xmath11 with a h atom at rest , @xmath12 is the total pion energy and @xmath13 is its mass , and @xmath14 is the atomic hydrogen density .",
    "@xmath15 is the minimum proton kinetic energy that contributes to the production of a pion with energy @xmath10 .",
    "it can be calculated from the kinematics easily .",
    "following dermer ( 1986a ) , we write @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the inclusive cross section for the reaction @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the @xmath9 multiplicity ) and @xmath20 is the normalized @xmath9 spectrum : @xmath21      we studied the three monte carlo programs hadrin ( hnssgen and ranft 1986 ) , pythia ( ststrand 1994 ) , and fritiof ( pi 1992 ) , in comparison with the scaling model of the @xmath9 production cross section by @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction given in an analytical form by stephens and badhwar ( 1981 ) .",
    "this scaling model was used in some of the previous calculations ( stephens and badhwar 1981 ; dermer 1986a ) .",
    "the first program , hadrin , focuses on a threshold and resonance behavior of inelastic hadron - nucleon interactions and uses tabulated cross sections for many possible reaction channels based on experimental data .",
    "it focuses on describing the nuclear collision at laboratory energies below 5 gev .",
    "[ fig : tp97cms ] shows the comparison of the simulated @xmath9 kinetic energy spectrum with experimental data and analytic calculations based on the isobar model ( stecker 1970 ) and the scaling model ( see also dermer 1986a ) in the center - of - mass system ( cms ) . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tp97ls ] is the same data but in laboratory system ( ls ) .",
    "one can see both hadrin and the isobar model calculations show good agreement with experimental data within limited statistical accuracy of the data .",
    "the program called pythia focuses on high - energy @xmath1-@xmath1 colliders and its performance is reported in detail ( sjstrand and van zijl 1987 ) .",
    "this is based on a string - fragmentation model , but incorporates low transverse momentum ( @xmath22 ) interactions , which is our main concern .",
    "its usefulness for fixed target experiments , the situation similar to ours , is not fully studied , however .",
    "the other program , fritiof , implements a model for low-@xmath22 hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus reactions which treats a hadron as a string - like object with its color force field stretching like a vortex line .",
    "a detailed description of the model and its comparison with experimental data are reported ( andersson , gustafson and pi 1993 ) .",
    "here we compare their predictions with the @xmath1-@xmath1 collision data : due to the experimental difficulty in obtaining @xmath9 spectra in high - multiplicities , we use gamma - ray spectra .",
    "[ fig : rapid ] shows the cms rapidity ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the pion energy in cms and @xmath25 the longitudinal momentum in cms ) distributions for beam momenta of 12.4 , 205 , and 300 gev / c .",
    "data are obtained in bubble chamber experiments at argonne ( jaeger et al .",
    "1975a ) and fermilab ( jaeger et al . 1975b",
    "; sheng et al .",
    "predictions and data are normalized to match the total cross sections given by the fitted formula given by dermer ( 1986b ) .",
    "the scaling calculation has been executed as a combination of the analytic stephens and badhwar ( 1981 ) model and a monte carlo program decay ( hnssgen and ritter 1984 ) to treat @xmath9 decays .",
    "one sees a general agreement of data with monte carlo predictions , but some overprediction is seen in the forward and backward ( @xmath26 ) directions at high energies .",
    "this tendency is more evident for pythia : it may partly due to its main intention to describe high transverse momentum ( @xmath22 ) phenomena , while fritiof is a model to describe low @xmath22 hadronic reactions .",
    "we do not use pythia to calculate the gamma - ray flux since the forward region plays an importrant role at high energies ( see below ) .",
    "[ fig : invcrs ] shows the comparison of the model prediction of the invariant cross section of @xmath9 production with experimental data at isr .",

    "monte carlo calculations agree well with the scaling calculations given by stephens and badhwar , but both of them overpredict the cross sections at higher rapidities , as was seen in the previous figure ( see the discussion of stephens and badhwar about the significance of this discrepancy ) .",
    "this results in systematic uncertainties of the final gamma - ray flux at higher energies ( @xmath28 gev ) .      measured inclusive cross sections , @xmath17 , for the reaction @xmath18",

    "we adopt dermer s parameterization below 1 tev / c and use @xmath30 mb as a smooth fit to the pythia prediction above 1 tev / c , where @xmath31 with @xmath32 the proton mass , since it is based on newer fit to the total cross section and charged particle multiplicity distributions are described well up to @xmath33 gev ( sjstrand and van zijl 1987 ) .      galactic diffuse gamma - rays",
    "are mostly produced in the central region of the galaxy and we should use the cosmic - ray spectrum there : however , since our knowledge is limited within the local solar neighborhood , the best we can do is to use the local cosmic - ray spectrum which is estimated by using appropriate assumptions from the solar - modulated spectrum actually observed .",
    "[ fig : crspec ] summarizes the observations and demodulated spectra calculated by different authors .",
    "there is a factor of about 5 uncertainty in the proton spectrum at @xmath34 gev , but as we will see these low energy protons do not contribute much to the diffuse flux , as has been pointed out before ( e.g.  stephens and badhwar 1981 ) . in order to quantify the spectrum uncertainty , we will calculate the diffuse gamma - ray flux for three extreme cases : the `` maximal '' ( `` minimal '' ) flux corresponds to the upper ( lower ) envelope of calculated demodulated spectra and connects to @xmath35 spectra above 100 gev , and the `` median '' flux takes the form of @xmath36^{-1/2 } & ( e_p\\le100\\,{\\rm gev } ) \\cr                       6.65\\times10^{-6}\\left({e_p \\over 100\\,{\\rm gev } }                       \\right)^{-2.75 } & ( e_p>100\\,{\\rm gev } )                      \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the unit is @xmath5s@xmath6sr@xmath6 .",
    "these are inspired by the parameterization on the demodulated spectrum given by ormes and protheroe ( 1983 ) for @xmath39 gev and the fit by honda et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for higher energies .",
    "the cosmic - ray proton fluxes used in this work are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crspecmm ] . notice that these fluxes are _ extremes _ and do not represent _ typical _ errors . since the direct observation of cosmic - ray composition",
    "is limited to energies less than @xmath40 gev / nucleus , and there may be a possible steepening of the proton flux above 40 tev ( asakimori et al .",
    "1993 ) , flux of diffuse gamma - rays above about @xmath41 gev suffers large uncertainty .",
    "the effect of heavier nuclei than proton in cosmic - ray and the interstellar matter was estimated by different authors .",
    "it has been treated as a constant multiplification factor independent of energy .",
    "this is valid for the calculation of diffuse gamma - rays in the gev region , since the proton / helium ratio in cosmic - rays seems to be constant in the 10@xmath42100 gev range .",
    "however , recent observations show different spectral indices between protons and other heavier nuclei ( see biermann , gaisser and stanev 1994 ; wiebel - sooth , bierman and meyer 1995 for summary ) . this difference may be explained by a model in which protons and heavier nuclei come from different kinds of sources ( biermann , gaisser and stanev 1994 ) .",
    "therefore we derive an energy dependence of this nuclear enhancement factor , @xmath43 , assuming @xmath35 spectrum for protons and @xmath44 spectra for heavier nuclei ( wiebel - sooth , bierman and meyer 1995 ) .",
    "following gaisser and shaefer ( 1992 ) , @xmath43 can be written as @xmath45\\,,\\ ] ] dropping a factor which is related to propagation ( only necessary for the case of antiprotons discussed in gaisser and shaefer ( 1992 ) , where @xmath46 is the ratio of numbers of nuclei of type @xmath47 to protons ( the subscript cr indicates the quantity in cosmic - rays ) , @xmath48 the total number of wounded nucleons in a collision between a nucleus @xmath47 and a proton ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 the total inelastic cross section for a collision between a nucleus @xmath47 and a proton ( @xmath49 ) , and @xmath51 is the ratio of helium to hydrogen in interstellar matter ( ism ) .",
    "the ism is assumed to be a mixture of 93% hydrogen and 7% helium after garcia - munoz et al .",
    "we assume @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the cosmic - ray abundance in gev range and is tabulated in gaisser and shaefer ( 1992 ) .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsm ] which is to be compared with previous estimates : 1.5 by cavallo and gould ( 1971 ) , @xmath54 by stephens and badhwar ( 1981 ) , 1.45 by dermer ( 1986a ) .",
    "@xmath43 takes a value of 1.52 for @xmath55 gev , as given in gaisser and shaefer ( 1992 ) .",
    "notice that in the above expression the relativistic rise of interaction cross sections is cancelled out .",
    "the differences may be partly attributed to a larger multiplicity enhancement factor used in stephens and badhwar ( 1981 ) and a lower helium / proton ratio used in dermer ( 1986a ) .",
    "monte carlo simulators can produce gamma - rays as final products instead of @xmath9 s , including the decay kinematics .",
    "also other secondaries , such as neutral kaons which may yield gamma - rays , are included , although their contribution is minor .",
    "thus we generated histograms for gamma - rays , not for @xmath9 s , for various proton energies with logarithmic binning ( 1 decade = 10 bins ) . in this case the equation ( [ eq : srcfn ] ) can be written in a summation form of @xmath56 or , using @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 with @xmath61 the normalized value of the histograms at @xmath62 ( @xmath63 here to incorporate the fact that 2@xmath64 s are produced by a @xmath9 ) . in the range of energies 3 gev @xmath65 12.5 gev no complete experimental data are available .",
    "therefore we decided to use hadrin for @xmath66 gev , the scaling model for @xmath67 gev , and fritiof for @xmath68 gev : we joined models with a linear connection in the overlapping energy regions ( 38 gev ) to obtain a smooth curve . above 10 gev results from two models will be compared . for monte carlo programs",

    "it is interesting to note that the power - law index obtained here is similar to that of the cosmic - ray source spectrum predicted by the cosmic - ray reacceleration theory ( ptuskin 1995 and references therein ) : in this theory the source spectrum is proportional to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 ( where @xmath96 is the rigidity ) and the escape length to @xmath97 to match the observed spectrum at all energies .    in any case , more detailed analysis is necessary before going on , since in the above fitting the bremsstrahlung and inverse compton components are fixed : these components will change following the electron spectrum which is related to the proton spectrum through the cosmic - ray proton to electron ratio , which is usually believed to be universal .    on the other hand , _ cos b _ data indicate that the diffuse gamma - ray spectrum in the inner galaxy ( @xmath98 ) is consistent with the cosmic - ray proton spectrum of about @xmath99 ( bloemen 1987 ) , which does not seem to be consistent with the egret result ( hunter et al .",

    "the result is not inconsistent with previous calculations : the observed excess of the galactic diffuse gamma - rays above about 1 gev can not be explained by revising the models of cosmic - ray interaction with interstellar matter .",

    "<S> this study is motivated by the result on the galactic diffuse gamma - ray flux observed by the egret detector on the compton gamma - ray observatory , which indicates an excess above about 1 gev of the observed intensity compared with a model prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the prediction is based on cosmic - ray interactions with interstellar matter , in which secondary pion productions are treated by a simple model . with the improved interaction model used here </S>",
    "<S> , however , the diffuse gamma - ray flux agrees rather well with previous calculations within uncertainties , which mainly come from the unobservable demodulated cosmic - ray spectrum in interstellar space . as a possible solution to the excess flux , </S>",
    "<S> flatter spectra of cosmic - ray protons have been tested and we found that the power - law spectrum with an index of about @xmath0 gives a better fit to the egret data , though the spectrum is not explained completely . </S>"
