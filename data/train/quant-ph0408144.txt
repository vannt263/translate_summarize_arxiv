    "since the discovery of a geometric effect by berry @xcite in the shape of an additional phase factor after an adiabatic and cyclic transport of a quantum system berry s phase has been intensively investigated and generalized : the extension to degenerate subspaces by wilckzek @xcite , the removal of the adiabatic constraint by aharonov and anandan @xcite and the cyclic condition by samuel and bhandari @xcite using the early ideas of pancharatnam @xcite and the kinematic approach to geomeric phases by mukunda and simon @xcite , to name a few . in all these contexts",
    "the geometric phase is dependent only on the geometry of the subjacent hilbert space , but not on the particular dynamics of the system under consideration .",
    "furthermore , manini and pistolesi @xcite proposed an off - diagonal geometric phase to exhibit the geometry of state space in situations where the usual ( diagonal ) geometric phase is undefined .",
    "this has been verified experimentally by some of the authors @xcite .",
    "in course of the development of quantum mechanics it has become clear that the concept of pure states is not sufficient when taking environmental influences causing decoherence effects into account .",
    "then one has to use the concept of mixed states .",
    "probably the first treatise of a geometric phase for mixed states is due to uhlmann @xcite in a quantum algebraic context .",
    "another definition of a mixed state geometric phase is due to sjqvist _",
    "@xcite using an interferometric approach for its definition . for both definitions",
    "one has to keep in mind that there exist points in parameter space for which the mixed state geometric phases remain undefined provoking an extension to off - diagonal mixed state geometric phases @xcite .",
    "the geometric phase is associated with an evolution of a system governed by an hamiltonian , e.  g. a neutron in a magnetic field where the geometric phase arises by the spinor evolution due to the coupling with the magnetic field . here",
    ", we observe a geometric phase as an effect of the change in the spatial degrees of freedom in an interferometry setup .",
    "a proposal to verify the spatial geometric phase is due to sjqvist @xcite using polarized neutrons by reversing the rles of the magnetic field and the spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , an experiment using unpolarized neutrons has been performed by hasegawa _",
    "@xcite to test the cyclic spatial geometric phase by inducing a relative phase shift of @xmath0 between the interfering neutron beams in a perfect silicon single - crystal interferometer .",
    "the geometric interpretation of this experiment has been dismissed by wagh @xcite demanding for further investigations , namely in the non - cyclic case , which is the purpose of the current article .",
    "let us briefly review the basic concepts of geometric phases : a geometric phase is a quantity which is deeply connected to the curvature of some underlying ( state- or parameter- ) space .",
    "a two - dimensional plane in three dimensional real space does not have an intrinsic curvature , but when considering a sphere embedded in euclidean real space we have to take the curvature of this manifold into account . in geometry this curvature is reflected for example in the angle difference of a vector transported around a loop along geodesics , i.  e. great circles : if a vector is pinned onto a sphere and then transported along a meridian to the equator , for some angle @xmath1 along the equator and back to the initial point without changing its length and its direction in the tangent plane to the surface of the sphere , the vector will point in a different direction with a relative angle of @xmath1 as the _ holonomy _ associated with the loop .",
    "if we do the same on a two - dimensional plane the initial and the final vector will point in the same direction .",
    "berry @xcite was the first who addressed this issue in quantum mechanics : he considered a system initially in an eigenstate @xmath2 of the governing hamiltonian @xmath3 dependent on the parameters @xmath4 changing with time @xmath5 .",
    "as a demonstrative example one may consider a neutron coupling to a magnetic field @xmath6 due to its magnetic dipole moment @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are the pauli matrices and the magnetic moment @xmath9 of a neutron .",
    "suppose now that the neutron is initially polarized in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "if the direction of the magnetic field is changed adiabatically , i.  e. slowly enough to avoid transitions to an orthogonal state , the system will stay in the eigenstate @xmath10 at all times @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , when tracing out a _ loop _ in parameter space the final state @xmath11 at time @xmath12 will be the same as the initial state up to an additional phase factor : @xmath13    the first phase value @xmath14 is dependent on the time needed to transverse the loop and on the energy @xmath15 of the system , whereas the second phase @xmath16 is dependent only on the circuit integral in parameter space revealing the geometric structure .",
    "the latter is termed _ berry phase _ or more general _ geometric phase _ in contrast to the former _ dynamical phase _ @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 can be rewritten as a surface integral by use of stoke s theorem yielding @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the surface enclosed by the loop in parameter space with @xmath21 denoting the area element and @xmath22 in an obvious abbreviated notation .",
    "for the neutron example  or more generally for any spin-1/2 particle ",
    "@xmath18 equals half of the solid angle enclosed by the loop as seen from the degeneracy point @xmath23 in parameter space .",
    "this can also be related to the example from geometry above where the holonomy after the transport of the vector pinned initially to the north pole of a sphere equals the solid angle as seen from the origin of the sphere .",
    "several restrictions have been relaxed in course of the years , e.  g. extensions to nonadiabatic @xcite , noncyclic and nonunitary @xcite , and nonpure @xcite geometric phases have been made .",
    "important in our case are the generalizations to the nonadiabatic regime by aharonov and anandan and to noncyclic paths by samuel and bhandari .    in this case",
    "we have to introduce the projective hilbert space ( ray space ) @xmath24 by identifying all state vectors in hilbert space @xmath25 which differ only by an overall phase factor : @xmath26 the stress is therefore shifted from the parameter space of the hamiltonian in case of berry s construction to state space .",
    "we are not interested in the changes of the driving parameters ( as the direction and strength of the magnetic field ) but in the changes of the state itself . in berry s considerations these two spaces",
    "are identical since the state follows the changes in parameters due to the adiabaticity condition .    in the construction by aharonov and anandan",
    "one considers an open path in hilbert space which is projected to a path in ray space by use of the equivalence relation in eq .",
    "( [ equivalence ] ) , i.  e. the curve @xmath27 \\mapsto { |\\phi(t)\\rangle } \\in \\mathcal{h}$ ] is projected to @xmath28 \\mapsto \\pi({|\\phi(t)\\rangle})\\equiv{|\\phi(t)\\rangle}{\\langle \\phi(t)| } \\in \\mathcal{r}$ ] with @xmath29 . for @xmath30",
    "an absolute phase factor of @xmath31 is immaterial , since the curve @xmath30 is defined via the evolution of the projection operator @xmath32 .",
    "the geometric phase is a property of ray space , where @xmath30 is closed due to the equivalence of the initial and the final state @xmath29 and can be calculated via a surface integral over the area enclosed by @xmath30",
    ".    one can find many different curves @xmath33 in hilbert space differing by a phase factor @xmath34 and yielding the same curve in ray space under the projection map @xmath35 .",
    "on the other hand for a given curve in ray space there exists one distinct curve in hilbert space fulfilling the parallel transport conditions , namely that two neighbouring states @xmath31 and @xmath36 in @xmath25 have the same phase , that is to say , @xmath37 is real and positive .",
    "this implies by taylor expansion that @xmath38 . for this curve",
    "the dynamical phase vanishes as one can verify by inserting the schrdinger equation @xmath39 into the parallel transport condition .",
    "the concept can be extended to apply to open paths in ray space where @xmath40 by closing the curve by a geodesic , i.  e. a path in ray space with the shortest distance from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "then one obtains a well - defined surface area enclosed by the path generated by the evolution of the system plus the geodesic closure .",
    "this surface provides an expression for the geometric phase , which has been proven by samuel and bhandari @xcite .    to sum up",
    ", for a general evolution of a quantum state the state obtains a dynamical phase dependent on the energy and time as well as a geometric phase only dependent on the subjacent geometry of state space . for special hamiltonians",
    "which fulfill the parallel transport conditions the dynamical phase vanishes , which is also the case when the state is transported along a geodesic .",
    "an example of the latter is an evolution along a great circle on a sphere for a two - level system which we will encounter in the forthcoming discussion .",
    "due to feynmann @xcite the description of any two - level quantum system is equivalent to the description of a spin-1/2 particle . exploiting this equivalence",
    "there is in principle no difference between manipulations in the spin space of neutrons with the orthogonal basis @xmath43 as eigenstates of @xmath44 , and momentum space with @xmath45 as orthogonal basis vectors corresponding to two directions of the neutron beam in an interferometer . in both cases",
    "one can assign a geometric phase to the particular evolution of the initial state .",
    "an even more appropriate description for the interferometric case for the forthcoming discussion is in terms of `` which - way '' basis states @xmath46 , namely , if the neutron is found in the upper beam path after a beamsplitting plate it is said to be in the state @xmath47 , or in the state @xmath48 , if found in the lower beam path . in case of a @xmath49 beamsplitting of the incident ( neutron )",
    "beam into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam the associated wave vector after the beamplitter can be written as an equally weighted coherent superposition of the two paths @xmath50 with the relative phase @xmath51 depending on the particular physical realization of the beamsplitter .",
    "for testing the spatial geometric phase we use a double - loop interferometer ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - setup ] ) , where the incident unpolarized neutron beam @xmath52 is split up into a diffracted reference beam @xmath53 and a transmitted beam @xmath54 .",
    "the transmitted beam is subjected to further evolution in the second loop of the interferometer by use of beamsplitters ( bs1 and bs2 ) , an absorber ( a ) with transmission coefficient @xmath55 and the phase shifter ps2 generating a phase shift of @xmath56 on the upper and @xmath57 on the lower beam path , respectively , yielding the final state @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath59 since before the beam splitter bs1 the beam is clearly localized as seen from the second loop of the interferometer .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath60 comprises all the manipulations in the second loop : @xmath61 the geometric phase can then be extracted from the argument of the complex valued scalar product between the initial and the final state @xmath62 ( when removing dynamical contributions as will be discussed later ) .",
    "this is where the reference beam comes into play : @xmath53 is not subjected to any further evolution , but is stationary apart from adding a phase factor @xmath63 by use of the phaseshifter ps1 .",
    "@xmath53 propagates towards the beamsplitter bs2 from the upper path , thus we can assert it to be in the state @xmath64 . then by the variable phase shift @xmath63 one can measure the shift of the interference fringes reflecting the phase difference between @xmath53 and @xmath65 .",
    "this preparation of the states is followed by the recombination of the two beams @xmath65 and @xmath53 at the beamsplitter bs2 and the detection at the detector d@xmath66 in the forward beam .",
    "this step can be described by the application of the projection operator @xmath67 ( with @xmath68 , which can always be achieved by an appropriate choice of the phase of the basis states ) to @xmath65 as well as to @xmath53 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is some scaling constant .",
    "the intensity @xmath71 measured in the detector @xmath72 is proportional to the absolute square of the superposition @xmath73 : @xmath74 we notice a phase shift of the interference pattern by @xmath75 .",
    "this phase shifts corresponds to the pancharatnam connection @xcite between the state @xmath76 and the state @xmath77 from which we can extract the geometric phase .",
    "explicitly we obtain @xmath78,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 .",
    "the geometric phase is defined as @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath17 denotes the dynamical part . from refs . @xcite and @xcite we know that the dynamical part stemming from the phase shifter ps2 is given by a weighted sum of the phase shifts @xmath81 and @xmath82 with the weights depending on the transmission coefficient @xmath55 .",
    "in particular we have @xmath83 which vanishes by an appropriate choice of phase shifts and transmission , i.  e. @xmath84 for @xmath85 .    by varying the relative phase @xmath86 from @xmath87 to @xmath0 and setting @xmath88 the geometric phase @xmath18",
    "can be plotted over @xmath86 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - phaseshift ] ) .    }",
    "$ ] in dependence on the relative phase shift @xmath89}$ ] for @xmath90.,width=264 ]",
    "for every two - level system we can use the _ bloch - sphere _ for depicting the state vectors and evolutions thereof as points and curves on a sphere . then the results obtained above , i.  e. the shift of the interference pattern in eq . ( [ eq : interference ] ) without dynamical contributions , should be equal to the ( oriented ) surface area enclosed by the paths of the state vectors on the _ bloch - sphere _ , or , equivalently , to the solid angle traced out by the state vectors as seem from the origin of the sphere .",
    "as we can observer in figure [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - bloch ] the north pole of the sphere can be identified with a state with well known path , i.  e. an eigenstate of the observable @xmath91 .",
    "after the beam splitter bs1 the state @xmath54 evolves to an equal superposition of upper path and lower path , therefore the evolution on the bloch sphere is given by a geodesic from the north pole to the equatorial line ( the particular point on the equator is arbitrary due to the arbitrary choice of the phases of the basis vectors ) .     and lower path @xmath92).,width=226 ]",
    "the absorber changes the weights of the superposed basis states , in particular for the extremal values of @xmath55 parameterized by the angle @xmath93 with @xmath94 we end up either again with an equally weighted superposition for no absorption ( @xmath95 or @xmath96 ) or the state is now on the north pole for total absorption ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) , since in the latter scenario we know the particle has taken the upper path when detecting a neutron in @xmath72 . for @xmath99",
    "the state is encoded as a point on the geodesic from the north pole to the equatorial line .    due to the phase shifter ps2",
    "we obtain a relative phase shift between the superposing states of @xmath100 : @xmath101 this can be depicted as an evolution along a circle of latitude on the bloch sphere with perodicity of @xmath0 .",
    "the recombination at bs2 followed by the detection of the forward beam in d@xmath66 is represented as a projection to the starting point on the equatorial line , i.  e. we have to close the curve associated with the evolution of the state by a geodesic to the point @xmath102 on the sphere as discussed for non - cyclic paths in section [ sec : geomphase ] . as for the reference state @xmath53",
    "we note that the phase shift of @xmath103 has no impact on the position of the state on the bloch sphere , it stays at the north pole . due to the recombination at bs2 and the detection the state",
    "is also projected to @xmath102 contributing to the forward beam incident to the detector d@xmath66 .",
    "the paths are depicted in figure [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - paths ] in detail for cyclic [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - bloch360 ] as well as non - cyclic evolution [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - bloch180 ] . for a relative phase difference greater than @xmath104 we have to take the direction of the loops into account . in [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - bloch180 ]",
    "the first loop is transversed clockwise , whereas the second loop is transversed counter - clockwise yielding a positive or negative contribution to the geometric phase , respectively .",
    "the numerical calculation of the surface area @xmath20 enclosed by the path transversed by the neutron is straightforward by evaluating the solid angle @xmath105 via a surface integral and using @xmath106 . for the cyclic case",
    "this integral can be solved easily by calculating the segment on the sphere according to figure [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - bloch360 ] to obtain @xmath107 . for the non - cyclic case",
    "no analytic expression has been found to compare the results with the phase shift of the interference fringes appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : interference ] ) . however , the numerical results are equivalent and agree with figure [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - phaseshift ] .",
    "for an experimental test of the spatial geometric beam we have used the double - loop perfect - crystal - interferometer installed at the s18-beamline at the high - flux reactor ill , grenoble @xcite . a schematic view of the setup is shown in figure [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - setup ] .",
    "before falling onto the skew - symmetric interferometer the incident neutron beam was collimated and monochromatized by the 220-bragg reflection of a si perfect crytal monochromator placed in the thermal neutron guide h25 .",
    "the wavelength was tuned to give a mean value of @xmath108 . to eliminate the higher harmonics we have used prism - shaped silicon wedges .",
    "the beam cross - section was confined to @xmath109 and an isothermal box enclosed the interferometer to achieve reasonable thermal environmental isolation . for the phase shifters parallel sided aluminium plates",
    "have been used : @xmath110 mm inserted in the first loop as ps1 and @xmath110 mm and @xmath111 mm , respectively , in the second loop for ps2 yielding a ratio of @xmath112 for @xmath113 . to avoid dynamical phase contributions",
    "a gadoldinium solution with @xmath114 is due to the different absorptions of the @xmath110 mm and @xmath111 mm al - phaseshifters .",
    "] has been used as an absorber . for a comparison with the theoretically predicted values",
    "one has to keep in mind that the contrast reflecting the coherence properties is different between each of the beams in the interferometer .",
    "accounting for this experimental fact in the theoretical derivation of the geometric phase we notice a slighlty flattened curve in figure [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - phaseshiftexp ] compared to figure [ fig:2004-splitbeamnist - phaseshift ] .",
    "nevertheless , one can recognize the increase in geometric phase for @xmath115 $ ] due to the positively oriented surface followed by a decrease due to appearance of a counter - clockwise transversed loop on the sphere yielding a negative phase contribution .",
    "in summary we have shown that one can ascribe a geometric phase not only to spin evolutions of neutrons , but also to evolutions in the spatial degrees of freedom of neutrons in an interferometric setup .",
    "this equivalence is evident from the description of both cases via state vectors in a two dimensional hilbert space .",
    "however , there have been arguments contra the experimental verification in @xcite which we believe can be settled in favour of a geometric phase appearing in the setup described above .",
    "the twofold calculations of the geometric either in terms of a shift in the interference fringes or via surface integrals in an abstract state space allows for a geometric interpretation of the obtained phase shift .",
