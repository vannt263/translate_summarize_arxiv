    "car @xmath11 tries to park in space @xmath12 .",
    "if the spot is full then @xmath11 parks in the first available spot @xmath13 .",
    "if no such spot exists then @xmath11 leaves the parking lot .",
    "the function @xmath14 is called a parking function if every car is able to park . ]",
    "let @xmath15 denote the set of parking functions , which carries a permutation representation of the symmetric group @xmath16 via @xmath17 .",
    "we will call this the classical parking space .",
    "we note that @xmath15 has size @xmath18 and its @xmath0-orbits are counted by the catalan number @xmath19 .",
    "each orbit is represented by an increasing parking function , but one could also parametrize the orbits by other catalan objects , for example the _ nonnesting partitions _",
    "defined in definition  [ nonnesting - partitions - definition ] below .",
    "[ s_3-parking - example ] below we exhibit the @xmath20 elements of @xmath21 , grouped into @xmath22 @xmath23-orbits by rows .",
    "the increasing orbit representatives are on the left . @xmath24",
    "the permutation action of @xmath23 on @xmath21 decomposes over the orbits .",
    "furthermore , note that the the action of @xmath23 on the orbit @xmath25 is isomorphic to the action on cosets of a subgroup of type @xmath26 , which has frobenius characteristic given by the complete homogeneous symmetric function @xmath27 .",
    "hence the action of @xmath23 on @xmath21 has frobenius characteristic @xmath28      now we review how the action of @xmath29 on @xmath15 can be generalized to other finite weyl groups @xmath0 ( crystallographic real reflection groups ) .",

    "given @xmath33 , let @xmath34 denote the reflection through the hyperplane @xmath35 .",
    "this endows @xmath0 with set of coxeter generators @xmath36 .",
    "the product @xmath37 ( taken in any order ) is called a coxeter element of @xmath0 .",
    "the coxeter elements form a single conjugacy class @xcite and the multiplicative order @xmath2 of any coxeter element is called the coxeter number of @xmath0 .    the role of @xmath0-parking functions",
    "is played by the quotient @xmath3 , having cardinality @xmath38 , of the two nested rank @xmath10 lattices @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath0-action on @xmath40 induces a permutation @xmath0-action on @xmath3 which we call the standard @xmath0-parking space ; see haiman ( * ? ? ? * and  7.3 ) .",

    "* prop 2.6.1 ) that the parking functions @xmath59 are a set of coset representatives for @xmath60 .",
    "in this paper we will propose two new @xmath0-parking spaces .",
    "the first space is defined combinatorially , in terms of the @xmath0-noncrossing partitions , and the second space is defined algebraically , as a quotient of the polynomial ring .",
    "these new spaces have the following features :    * for crystallographic @xmath0 , both are isomorphic as @xmath0-representations to the standard @xmath0-parking space @xmath3 .",
    "however , * both are defined more generally for _ non - crystallographic _ finite reflection groups , and * both carry an additional @xmath4-action , where @xmath61 is the cyclic subgroup of @xmath0 generated by a coxeter element @xmath62 .",
    "our main conjecture states that the two new parking spaces are _ isomorphic to each other _ as @xmath4-permutation representations , which has several consequences for the catalan combinatorics of finite reflection groups . in the next section",
    "we will define the new parking spaces , state the main conjecture , and explore some of its consequences .",
    "after that we will give evidence for the conjecture , prove some special cases , and suggest problems for the future .",
    "first we will review the concepts of @xmath0-noncrossing and @xmath0-nonnesting partitions . for a full treatment ,",

    "however , one can still discuss the ( noncrystallographic ) root system @xmath64 of unit normals to the reflecting hyperplanes @xmath65 for the set of all reflections @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 denote the arrangement of reflecting hyperplanes and consider its lattice @xmath68 of intersection subspaces ( called _ flats _",
    "@xmath69 ) , ordered by reverse - inclusion .    again , consider the irreducible action of @xmath16 on the codimension - one subspace @xmath53 .",
    "the reflections of @xmath29 are precisely the transpositions @xmath70 , where @xmath71 switches the @xmath11 and @xmath72 coordinates in @xmath73 and hence reflects in the hyperplane @xmath74 .",
    "a typical intersection flat @xmath69 is defined by setting several blocks of coordinates equal , and corresponds to a set partition @xmath75 of @xmath76 $ ] for which one has @xmath77 if and only if @xmath11 and @xmath72 occur in the same block of @xmath78 .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath79 , the flat @xmath69 defined by equations @xmath80 corresponds to the set partition @xmath81      the reflecting hyperplanes @xmath82 decompose @xmath40 into connected components called chambers , on which @xmath0 acts simply - transitively .",
    "choose a fundamental chamber @xmath83 for this action and for each reflecting hyperplane say that @xmath83 lies in the  positive \" half - space .",
    "this induces a choice of positive roots @xmath41  the `` positive '' normal vectors  and simple roots @xmath84  corresponding to the hyperplanes that bound @xmath83 .",
    "the reflections @xmath36 defined by the simple roots @xmath85 endow @xmath0 with a coxeter system @xmath86 .",
    "fix once and for all a coxeter element @xmath87 by ordering @xmath88 .",

    "it turns out ( see carter @xcite ) that @xmath91 is equal to the codimension of the @xmath0-fixed space @xmath95 , that is , @xmath96 .",

    "furthermore , the map @xmath106 is a poset automorphism , which corresponds to the action @xmath107 on noncrossing flats .    for @xmath16 one can choose as coxeter generators the set of adjacent transpositions @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
