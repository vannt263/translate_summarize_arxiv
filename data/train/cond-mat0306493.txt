    "microscopic models with long - range ( lr ) interactions decaying as a power law , i.e. , as @xmath1 , have aroused renewed interest during the last decade . beyond their fundamental relevance to the understanding of critical phenomena ,",
    "they have started playing a seminal role in the modeling of neural networks @xcite and spin glasses with ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interactions @xcite , systems undergoing phase separation , e.g. , highly ionic systems @xcite and model alloys @xcite , and more widely in a large class of chemical or biological models where electrostatic interactions , polarization , or van der waals forces play a central role .",
    "they have also attracted much attention in the framework of nonextensive thermodynamics , where a possible equivalence with short - ranged ( sr ) models is under consideration @xcite .    since the very early work of ruelle @xcite , lr spin models in particular have been extensively studied . in one - dimensional models , it has been widely shown that long - range order occurs at finite temperature if and only if @xmath6 @xcite , and this is in strong contrast to the sr case where no phase transition exists at finite temperature .",
    "fisher and co - workers @xcite have shown that the upper critical dimension is reduced to @xmath7 , whereby one - dimensional lr models exhibit mean - field - like behavior for @xmath8 , with the critical exponents taking on their classical values @xmath9 and @xmath10 provided the phase transition is continuous .",
    "conversely , the critical behavior for @xmath11 yields nontrivial exponents , and lr models in effect go through a variety of universality classes as @xmath12 is varied within this range , thus exhibiting rich critical behavior . due to the ability to continuously vary the range of interaction , which in effect alters the effective dimension of the model , one - dimensional lr models are therefore a powerful paradigm for studying the dependence of critical properties on dimensionality , e.g. , in systems above their upper critical dimension @xcite .    while significant emphasis has been placed on the ising chain ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) , specific studies of the lr @xmath0-state potts model are less numerous and rather recent .",
    "these include a transfer matrix study combined with finite - range scaling ( frs ) @xcite , renormalization group ( rg ) analyses based on wilson s momentum - shell method @xcite or a real - space procedure @xcite , a cluster mean - field approach @xcite , and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the last , however , mostly focused on the case @xmath13 , and led to numerical estimates of critical exponents and temperatures showing some discrepancies .",
    "due to the higher ground state degeneracy , this model reveals a phase diagram markedly richer than that of the ising chain .",
    "it has been shown in the sr case that the transition turns from a continuous to a first - order one as the number of states @xmath0 is increased beyond a threshold value @xmath14 depending on the dimensionality of the model .",
    "for instance , @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete review ) . as for the lr case in @xmath17 , glumac and uzelac",
    "have shown from mc studies of the three- and five - state potts model @xcite that the same sort of behavior occurs , i.e. , there is a so - called tricritical point at some value @xmath2 depending on @xmath0 , and the transition is continuous for @xmath18 .",
    "this qualitative picture was later reinforced in @xcite for @xmath19 and in @xcite for @xmath13 , both relying on mc studies , and in @xcite using a graph - weights approach .",
    "on the other hand , it is noteworthy that rg analyses dedicated to lr models have remained thus far rather inconclusive , where distinguishing between first- and second - order transitions is concerned @xcite .",
    "although it is now believed that @xmath20 depends continuously on the range of interaction for this class of models , the exact location of the tricritical line separating both regions is still fairly controversial .",
    "the biggest hurdle for a precise and reliable determination of this borderline actually stems from the weakening of the discontinuous transition as @xmath21 is approached , even if exceptionally large lattice sizes are simulated , e.g. , using the efficient luijten - blte cluster algorithm @xcite . while for @xmath13 @xmath21 was claimed to lie between @xmath22 and @xmath23 in @xcite , krech and luijten pointed out that @xmath24 still belongs to the first - order regime , and that the second - order regime may set in for @xmath25 only @xcite .",
    "the situation with @xmath26 turns out to be even worse , with numerical estimates available only within fairly large ranges : a lower boundary value of @xmath27 was reported in @xcite , whereas @xmath28 according to @xcite .",
    "these results have not yielded a very precise phase diagram as yet , with the only reliable assertion being that @xmath2 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the marginal case @xmath29 raises another set of thorny questions : in @xcite it was reported that the phase transition changes from a second - order to a first - order one for @xmath30 , while it has been shown by kosterlitz , using a model with a continuum of states @xcite , and later on by cardy , using a discrete model @xcite , that inverse square interactions give rise to a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition , i.e. , one governed by topological defects @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that both hypotheses may be reconciled , at least partially , by following a scenario similar to the one devised in @xcite , whereby for @xmath31-like models with nonlinear nearest - neighbor interactions , the kt - like transition is preempted by a first - order transition whenever the nonlinearity becomes strong enough .",
    "while the recent work of luijten and messingfeld on the three - state potts model @xcite lends further support to cardy s assertion , the controversy still appears unsettled , however , and in this view a determination of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath2 as @xmath32 seems of major interest indeed .",
    "we wish to shed light on some of these contradictory results using mc simulations in generalized ensembles , with particular emphasis put on the first - order regime .",
    "the aim of this work is thus twofold .",
    "first , we propose an implementation of the multicanonical algorithm dedicated to the numerical study of lr models .",
    "this algorithm , devised by berg and neuhaus a decade ago @xcite , has been successfully applied in the past to sr models undergoing first - order transitions .",
    "as numerical studies of models exhibiting first - order transitions are dramatically hampered by huge tunneling times when using standard metropolis update mechanisms @xcite , a multicanonical approach is indeed an appropriate choice for both the determination of the location of the tricritical line and the estimation of critical couplings in the first - order region @xmath33 .",
    "our purpose is therefore to adapt the scheme initially proposed for sr models so as to make it suitable for a large class of lr models .",
    "second , by relying on an extensive study for @xmath34 and a wide range of @xmath12 values , we arrive at convincing conclusions regarding the location of the tricritical line , the range of validity of the mean - field - like behavior , which we find much larger than in previous studies , and the crossover from the lr to the sr regime , although the last was investigated for the three - state model only .",
    "we show that our multicanonical implementation yields numerical estimates which are in agreement with and often better than those found in previous studies , although our simulations were performed by relying on medium lattice sizes , i.e. , @xmath35 spins . in particular , we obtain the following estimates for @xmath2 : @xmath36,@xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and these results are highly precise .",
    "we also offer convincing evidence that the phase transition in the limiting case @xmath40 is not of the first order for all values of @xmath0 , by virtue of an unusual finite - size effect . a detailed finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis conducted for @xmath41 shows",
    "that , while the transition belongs to the first - order regime at finite lattice size , its first - order nature wanes quickly enough as size is increased so that the transition tends to a continuous one in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we give a qualitative account of this behavior in terms of correlation lengths , and by raising some open questions regarding the dynamics of first - order transitions in the lr case , we try to challenge the usual picture inherited from sr models . finally , by relying on the shape of the specific heat and computing several moments of the magnetization",
    ", we conclude that a crossover between lr and sr regimes occurs inside a narrow window @xmath5    the layout of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model_theory ] , we first review some prominent features of the lr potts model through a mean - field ( mf ) analysis .",
    "special emphasis is given to the calculation of the location of spinodal points , a feature we will use in sec .  [ sec : results ] for estimating @xmath2 .",
    "section  [ sec : muca_algo ] is devoted to implementation details of the multicanonical algorithm specific to lr models .",
    "we discuss the iteration procedure used to obtain the best estimate for the density of states , the choice of an efficient predictor , and a reliable convergence criterion .",
    "improvements over the original algorithm are made in order to work out the algorithm instability due to low energy levels being unequally spaced .",
    "numerical results regarding both first- and second - order regimes are then presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "since we do not know of any previous implementation of a generalized ensemble algorithm in the case of lr spin models , we pay particular attention to comparison with other standard mc algorithms , i.e. , in terms of dynamical exponents , tunneling times , and accuracy of numerical estimates of critical couplings .",
    "throughout this work we consider a ferromagnetic potts model incorporating lr interactions in @xmath17 .",
    "this model is derived from a generalized @xmath0-state potts hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath42 where the potts spin @xmath43 at site @xmath44 can take on the values @xmath45 , the first sum runs over all pairs of sites , and @xmath46 is an external aligning field favoring condensation in state @xmath47 .",
    "incorporation of lr interactions is carried out by setting @xmath48 where @xmath17 throughout this study , and @xmath12 is an adjustable parameter which can be related to the effective dimension of the model .",
    "as @xmath12 falls off to @xmath49 , this model tends to the mean - field case where all interactions have equal strength , whereas the limiting case @xmath50 corresponds to a pure sr model .",
    "crossover from lr to sr behavior should actually take place at @xmath40 @xcite , yet no numerical evidence has been given so far for this model which would reinforce this assertion .",
    "the thermodynamics of the model is studied numerically by way of the following order parameter : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the density of potts spins in state @xmath54 , which varies between @xmath55 at infinite temperature and @xmath56 in the ground state . on a lattice of size @xmath57 , numerical implementation is carried out by using periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , one adds up interactions between all the spins of the original lattice only , and replaces the bare coupling constant @xmath58 by @xmath59 .",
    "retaining only interactions such that @xmath60 leads indeed to strong shifts in energy and critical couplings for low @xmath12 values , especially when finite - size scaling is to be used with medium lattice sizes .",
    "for the purpose of numerical evaluation , this sum may be reexpressed as @xmath61,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 denotes the hurwitz zeta function .",
    "the self - energy will be omitted since it is just an additive constant to the total energy .",
    "mean - field behavior can be readily obtained by using a variational mf approach ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , which relies on the minimization of the following functional @xmath63 = { \\operatorname{tr}}\\rho h + kt { \\operatorname{tr}}\\rho\\ln\\rho\\ ] ] with respect to a trial density matrix @xmath64 . here",
    "the trace operation means a sum over all spin configurations , and the dependence of @xmath65 and @xmath64 on the spin configuration is implied .",
    "$ ] reaches a minimum whenever @xmath67 , i.e. , in the case of a canonical gibbs distribution , and this minimum yields the free energy of the system .",
    "the mean - field approximation allows us to express the density matrix @xmath64 of the whole system as a product of one - site density matrices @xmath68 which depend solely on the spin variable at site @xmath44 .",
    "we may thus rewrite the trace operation as a sum involving traces on single spin variables , namely , @xmath69 & = kt \\sum_i { \\operatorname{tr}}_i \\rho_i \\ln\\rho_i                -\\sum_i h_i { \\operatorname{tr}}_i \\rho_i \\delta_{\\sigma_i,\\sigma_0 }     \\\\      & -\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i\\neq j } { \\operatorname{tr}}_i \\rho_i { \\operatorname{tr}}_j   \\rho_j j_{ij } \\delta_{\\sigma_i,\\sigma_j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for further comparison with numerical results , we are mainly interested in expressing the free energy as a function of an order parameter which is as similar as possible to the one defined above .",
    "this is carried out by parametrizing the trial density matrix @xmath68 in terms of the following order parameter field : @xmath70 where the average is weighted by the trial density matrix @xmath68 .",
    "seeing that all states but state @xmath47 are equivalent , the constraint @xmath71 thus yields @xmath72 considering a uniform external field @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 for all sites ; hence the free energy per spin @xmath75 reduces to @xmath76 \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we dropped terms which are constant in @xmath77 so that @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "this function expands as @xmath80 around @xmath81 ; hence transition temperatures are expected to vary as @xmath80 in the vicinity of the mf regime .",
    "equilibrium values of the order parameter are located at minima of the free energy , and it can be seen that @xmath82 is a stable minimum for @xmath83 . for @xmath84 , there is no third - order term in the series expansion of @xmath75 ; hence a second - order transition occurs at @xmath85 . for @xmath86 , the negative coefficient in the third - order term of the series expansion creates a second minimum , which physically corresponds to a first - order transition . at the transition temperature ,",
    "the free energy has the same value at both minima . following @xcite ,",
    "the exact transition temperature @xmath87 may be computed by simultaneously solving @xmath88 and yields @xmath89     and @xmath90 together with the reduced transition temperature @xmath91 , as a function of @xmath0 in the mf approximation.,title=\"fig : \" ]    similarly , spinodal points are computed by jointly solving @xmath92 , giving temperature points at which either one of the two minima vanishes .",
    "these equations possess one trivial solution , namely , @xmath93 corresponding to the extrema at @xmath82 becoming unstable , and a nontrivial solution @xmath94 which may be obtained numerically by solving the following equation , @xmath95 where @xmath96 and we have set @xmath97 . alternatively",
    ", one may also express @xmath98 as a function of the mf energy @xmath99 and impose @xmath100 .",
    "while these equations yield the same @xmath101 and @xmath94 as above , the two expressions of @xmath98 obviously do not have the same shape .",
    "spinodal points are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory_potts_model_metastable_states ] for @xmath0 between @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "these correspond to the limit of metastability for each subphase , respectively . for temperature points lying inside this temperature range ,",
    "there exist two values of the order parameter corresponding to a null curvature of the free energy , a feature which is known to induce a long - ranged ( i.e. , low wave number ) instability .",
    "this in turn triggers a phase transition through the so - called spinodal decomposition @xcite . as expected , the width of the spinodal curve @xmath104 shrinks to zero as @xmath105 , and accounts for the second - order nature of the transition at @xmath84 , since in this limit the two minima merge into a single large minimum responsible for the well - known divergence of fluctuations at a continuous transition .",
    "the metropolis algorithm ( hereafter denoted as belonging to the class of _ canonical _ algorithms , i.e. , relying on a boltzmann weighting ) has long been considered the paradigm for monte carlo simulations in statistical physics , yet this method faces some severe drawbacks in situations where the sequence of states created by the markovian chain leads to very repetitive dynamics , i.e. , dramatically low acceptance rates and exponentially diverging autocorrelation times : this makes it necessary to simulate systems over exceedingly long runs in order to obtain good statistics and reliable estimates of thermodynamical averages ( see , for example , @xcite and the contribution by krauth in @xcite for an introductory review ) .",
    "this is the case when one comes to simulating systems with rugged free energy landscapes , e.g. , polymers , proteins , and disordered systems including spin - glasses , for the dynamics may then get trapped in one of numerous local minima , especially at low temperature .",
    "one experiences similar behavior when simulating first - order phase transitions ( the so - called supercritical slowing down @xcite ) , where the tunneling time between coexisting phases grows exponentially with the system size , due to the increasingly high free energy barrier to be overcome ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since slow dynamics mainly results from the combination of weighting the markovian chain with boltzmann weights and using local updates , there have been several attempts to devise efficient update algorithms based on _ global updates _ , e.g. , cluster algorithms , which in the case of continuous transition decrease critical slowing down by several orders of magnitude ( see @xcite ; also a lr implementation in @xcite ) . on the contrary , multicanonical methods @xcite are based on random walks in the energy landscape , irrespective of the particular move update utilized , whereby a _ flat _",
    "energy distribution is now sampled .",
    "first , this results in the algorithm quickly sampling a much wider phase space than in the canonical case , by allowing the system to cross any free energy barrier .",
    "second , this allows the density of states to be computed over the whole energy axis , thus extending the reliability of reweighting procedures over a much wider range of temperature than in the case of standard histogram methods @xcite , where poor histogram sampling at low - energy usually induces strong statistical bias .",
    "as opposed to multihistogramming @xcite , a single run is needed to cover the energy range of interest .",
    "once a reliable estimate of the density of states has been obtained , it is then straightforward to compute thermodynamical functions otherwise hardly within reach of canonical simulations , e.g. , canonical entropy and free energy .",
    "it is noteworthy that this simulation technique actually belongs to a larger class of algorithms called _ generalized - ensemble _ algorithms , which encompasses variants based on random walk in the entropic variable ( `` @xmath106 ensemble '' or `` entropic sampling '' algorithms @xcite ) , or the temperature variable ( e.g. , `` simulated tempering '' @xcite ) .",
    "the rationale behind the multicanonical algorithm is the generation of a markovian chain of states @xmath107 , whose weights @xmath108 are tweaked so that one eventually gets a flat energy histogram , i.e. if @xmath109 denotes the probability in energy and @xmath110 is the density of states , @xmath111 since @xmath110 usually increases drastically with energy , low - energy states are thus sampled much more often than high - energy ones .",
    "following berg in @xcite , we compute @xmath112 through an iterative procedure , starting from an initial canonical simulation at inverse temperature @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath113 indirectly sets the energy below which the energy histogram is to be flat , i.e. @xmath114 .",
    "thus , @xmath115 must be chosen high enough to ensure that the final energy histogram spans a suitably large energy range upward , e.g. , reaches the energy of the disordered phase in the case of a first - order transition , and extends even further away if one wants to observe with satisfying accuracy the free energy plateaus signaling the limit of metastability . for convenience , we now define an effective hamiltonian @xmath116 , so that @xmath117 hence , multicanonical simulation can be envisioned as a canonical simulation at inverse temperature @xmath113 with the usual boltzmann weight , provided the original hamiltonian is replaced by an effective hamiltonian to be determined iteratively . as a side note , a cluster implementation in the framework of the multicanonical algorithm is thus far less straightforward , since this effective hamiltonian has fundamentally a global nature , whereas canonical simulations explicitly preserve the locality of the original hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , the multibond approach in @xcite ) .    denoting @xmath118 as the true estimate of the effective hamiltonian , we may thus write @xmath119 the microcanonical inverse temperature @xmath120 may be easily related to @xmath118 , as we have ( assuming @xmath121 ) @xmath122 since the dynamics of the markovian chain is governed by the transition rate @xmath123\\})$ ] , we may write , for two states infinitely close in energy ,",
    "i.e. , whenever @xmath124 , @xmath125)$ ] .",
    "hence it is the _ microcanonical temperature _ which is the relevant quantity where the dynamics ( e.g. , the acceptance rate ) of the multicanonical algorithm is concerned .",
    "we initially set @xmath126 , or equivalently @xmath127 , as this indeed corresponds to a canonical simulation at temperature @xmath128 . at step @xmath44 ,",
    "a simulation is performed using a boltzmann weight with effective hamiltonian @xmath129 ; then an energy histogram @xmath130 is eventually computed using independent samples .",
    "incidentally , taking truly independent samples proves useful during the late stages of the iteration scheme only , where the aim is then to refine a nearly flat histogram . during early iteration steps",
    ", histograms may be computed using nonindependent samples without significantly affecting the convergence .",
    "we now denote @xmath131 as the lowest energy level that was reached throughout the previous runs , including step @xmath44 : this is the energy level below which @xmath132 will have to be predicted , since no histogram data are available inside this energy range .",
    "issues regarding adequate predictor choice will be considered later on in this section .",
    "the rules for updating @xmath133 at step @xmath134 from @xmath135 at step @xmath44 are based on the following equations . for @xmath136 , @xmath137 ,",
    "i.e. , the dynamics is canonical - like at inverse temperature @xmath113 for all iteration steps . for @xmath138 , @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 is a _",
    "raw _ inverse damping factor proportional to the reliability of the @xmath142th histogram .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite , following an error calculation argument , that @xmath143 provides an estimator proportional to the inverse of the variance of @xmath144 .",
    "once @xmath144 is known , @xmath145 is derived by a mere integration starting from the initial condition @xmath146 .",
    "finally , for @xmath147 , @xmath132 will have to be computed using a suitably chosen predictor , until at last @xmath131 becomes equal to the ground state energy .",
    "a cubic spline is then fitted to @xmath116 at every bin center , and this curve is used to compute acceptance probabilities during the next run .",
    "it can be seen that eq .",
    "( [ equ : update_beta_g0cum ] ) leads to a steady state whenever @xmath148 is constant over the energy range of interest .",
    "writing a recursion equation involving @xmath120 instead of @xmath116 , together with the inclusion of a damping factor , allows one to handle the situation where some bins have null entries , a case which otherwise leads to a fairly spiky graph for @xmath116 and inconsistent dynamics .",
    "_ accidental _ null entries at energy values @xmath149 or @xmath150 will simply leave @xmath120 unchanged , and the corresponding parts of @xmath116 thus move as a block .",
    "since acceptance rates hinge on the microcanonical temperature , this in effect drastically reduces bias on the dynamics . considering a small set of histogram bins that are copiously filled for the first time during a given iteration run ( e.g. , high - energy bins during the early iteration runs whenever we begin with a canonical simulation )",
    ", we see that the related _ cumulative _ inverse damping factor first soars and produces a great amount of change in @xmath120 in the couple of runs that follow , and then decays progressively to zero as these bins continue to be filled . by taking into account all the data that have been sampled up to step @xmath44",
    ", this modified recursion both clearly stabilizes the algorithm and reduces relative errors due to poor histogram sampling .    choosing the most appropriate value of the histogram bin width results from a trade - off between resolution and computation time . a higher resolution on the one hand guarantees good histogram flatness , and is especially crucial at low energy levels , where the density of states displays a rugged graph",
    "on the other hand , we impose a fixed number of independent samples per histogram bin , so as to give the histogram variance an acceptably low value ; hence a low @xmath151 implies more simulation steps per iteration .",
    "our approach is thus to first choose a fairly high @xmath151 , e.g. , one yielding around @xmath152 bins , during the early stages of the iteration process in order to obtain a rough picture of the density of states , and then to progressively reduce @xmath151 once the ground state has been reached . as will become obvious in sec .",
    "[ sec : free_energy ] , the ultimate value of @xmath151 deeply affects the attainable precision on the computation of spinodal points , since the latter is based on a precise location of free energy plateaus , and this indeed entails having enough bins belonging to a given plateau . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "the best compromise is then to obtain between @xmath153 and @xmath154 histogram bins in the final stage , with the number of bins increasing as the @xmath12 value corresponding to the second - order regime is approached .",
    ", computed by sorting energy samples from a long simulation run .",
    "each level is drawn as a horizontal line.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this view , the unequal spacing of energy levels in lr spin models deserves specific attention . as witnessed in fig .",
    "[ fig : first - energy - levels - q5s05n400 ] , large energy gaps separate isolated energy levels or tiny groups thereof in the vicinity of the ground state , whereas the distribution gradually turns into a near continuum above @xmath155 .",
    "setting a low @xmath151 value leads in turn to _",
    "nonaccidental _ null entries in those bins located inside energy gaps , whereby @xmath120 never gets updated at isolated energy levels and @xmath156 is always zero . since the graph of the density of states",
    "looks indeed fairly wrinkled near the ground state , and the dynamics there is noticeably sensitive to even the smallest departure of @xmath116 from the ideal line , we would then observe a sharp steady peak in the lowest part of the energy histogram , which the present recursion would not be able to suppress .",
    "one could trivially think of working this out by implementing variable - width bins that would span energy gaps .",
    "this is , however , impracticable since the distribution of energy levels is not known prior to starting the iteration process ( for this is precisely what we intend to compute with the density of states ) . to circumvent this limitation ,",
    "we have modified the previous recursion so that null entries are always skipped , however accidental or nonaccidental they may be . denoting by @xmath157 and @xmath158 , with @xmath159 , the centers of histogram bins located on each side of a set of contiguous empty bins , we have @xmath160 where @xmath161 and we now impose @xmath162 hence @xmath156 can never be zero . in order to avoid losing details of the shape of @xmath116 for @xmath163 that were possibly collected during previous runs , we update @xmath116 through a linear difference scheme , @xmath164 where @xmath165 . while this has obviously no effect where nonaccidental null entries are concerned , this favors quicker convergence during the early runs where the inadequate shape of @xmath116 is more likely to produce empty bins .",
    "the iteration process stops whenever the energy histogram has become suitably flat over the energy range of interest , namely , between the ground state energy and @xmath166 for our purpose .",
    "we evaluate this property by computing the standard deviation of histogram entries , as well as the same quantity for the logarithm of histogram entries restricted to nonempty bins .",
    "the latter seems to be a better indicator since it is sensitive to both poorly populated bins and histogram peaks , whereas the former increases only with rather spiky histograms .",
    "in addition , we estimate the degree of convergence of the algorithm by computing the mean square distance between @xmath167 and @xmath132 after the ground state has been reached .",
    "we then compute a threshold value for each indicator by trial and error , based on a couple of short runs for various lattice sizes and bin widths .",
    "once @xmath116 has been satisfactorily computed , a long production run is performed using this effective hamiltonian in place of the original one , and then estimates of thermodynamical quantities of interest at inverse temperature @xmath168 are computed using a reweighting scheme , i.e. , formally , @xmath169 where @xmath170 denotes the microcanonical average of @xmath171 at energy @xmath149 , and the partition function is given by @xmath172 . the best estimate for the density of states @xmath110",

    "in addition , since the reweighting scheme involves an exponential contribution of @xmath116 , the resulting curve @xmath178 is strongly peaked around the maximum ; hence it is clear that only histogram points in the vicinity of this maximum contribute to @xmath174 . in effect",
    ", we found that the existence of two distinct maxima , or equivalently of two energy values for which @xmath120 has the same value , coincides with the occurrence of a first - order phase transition .",

    "we found however that the crossover from the lr to the sr regime occurs between @xmath40 and @xmath352 , thus lending strong support to sak s conjecture .",
    "our detailed fss analysis of the case @xmath353 yielded one of the most surprising results of this study , namely , the unexpected behavior of correlation lengths whereby the transition appears to be of the first order at finite lattice size , despite the fact that fss theory predicts a continuous transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we feel strongly that this may be accounted for by the truncation of the lr potential , which artificially brings the model closer to the mf regime , yet we also pointed out that the physical meaning of the correlation length should be somewhat challenged in the case of lr models .",
    "the exact nature of the transition in the borderline case @xmath40 , however , needs further investigation , especially at large @xmath0 where no results have been made available thus far .",
    "in this view , an efficient combination of a global update scheme with a multicanonical approach would be of prior importance to reach far higher lattice sizes .",
