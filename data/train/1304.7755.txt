    "the uncertainty principle is often considered as a key feature of quantum theory , as it explicitly emphasizes the difference with respect to its classical counterpart . the original formulation given by heisenberg in 1927 @xcite which had been devoted to canonically conjugated variables was further generalized by robertson in 1929 for arbitrary two observables @xcite .",
    "if both observables do not commute , it is impossible to specify their precise values simultaneously . in this set - up uncertainties",
    "are characterized by the variances of both variables , and the relation provides a lower bound for the product of these quantities .",
    "another method to describe the uncertainty is to use the continuous entropy of the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes . in 1975",
    "biaynicki  birula and mycielski derived the entropic formulation of the uncertainty relation @xcite , in which the main role is played by the lower bound for the sum of two continuous shannon entropies calculated for position and momentum probability distributions .",
    "entropic uncertainty relations , originally introduced for the infinite dimensional hilbert space , were later investigated in the case of a finite dimensional quantum systems . consider a pure state @xmath1 belonging to an @xmath2 dimensional hilbert space @xmath3 and a non - degenerate observable @xmath4 , the eigenstates @xmath5 of which determine an orthonormal basis in @xmath3 .",
    "the probability that this observable measured in @xmath1 gives the @xmath6th outcome is @xmath7 .",
    "the non - negative numbers @xmath8 sum up to unity , @xmath9 , so that the properties of the discrete probability distribution @xmath10 can be described by the shannon entropy @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the shannon entropy corresponding to the probability vector @xmath13 associated with the second observable @xmath14 .",
    "if both observables do not commute the sum of both entropies for any state @xmath1 is bounded from below , and the bound depends only on the unitary rotation matrix @xmath15 .",
    "the first lower bound : @xmath16 where @xmath17 was with the help of variational calculus derived by deutsch in 1983 @xcite .",
    "maassen and uffink obtained in  1988   a stronger result of the form @xcite @xmath18 note that for a fourier matrix of size @xmath2 , which describes the transition from position to momentum representation , one has @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 .    the result of maassen and uffink , while stronger than the deutsch lower bound , is known to be not optimal in the general case .",
    "the optimal bound is known only for @xmath21 @xcite , however in higher dimensions the problem remains open .",
    "let us mention that the entropic uncertainty relations were recently formulated in various set - ups @xcite . to learn more about further developments in that area the reader",
    "is asked to consult reviews @xcite .    in general , it is convenient @xcite to work with the rnyi entropy @xmath22 which tends to the shannon entropy for @xmath23 , is equal to the min - entropy @xmath24 in the limit @xmath25 and is a non - increasing function of the parameter @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "one may then look for bounds for the sum of two rnyi entropies of order @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , explicit bounds in the case @xmath27 have been for @xmath21 recently obtained by rastegin @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to derive a novel bound , which for a generic unitary @xmath28 is with high probability stronger than ( [ mu ] ) .",
    "we shall establish lower bounds for the sum of two entropies of an arbitrary order @xmath29 , @xmath30 with @xmath31 depending in general on the whole matrix @xmath28 .    to improve the approaches of deutsch and maassen  uffink ( corresponding to the case @xmath32 ) we are going to characterize the unitary rotation matrix @xmath28 by taking into account all its entries .",
    "our approach is based on the concept of majorization .",
    "consider any two probability vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 of sizes @xmath2 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "associated vectors of size @xmath36 , with coefficients ordered decreasingly and zeros on additional coordinates possibly added to the shorter vector , will be denoted as @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the vector @xmath33 is said to be _",
    "majorized _ by @xmath34 , written @xmath39 , if @xmath40 satisfy inequalities for all partial sums  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 runs from @xmath43 to @xmath36 .",
    "note that for @xmath44 the inequality is trivially saturated as both vectors sum up to @xmath43 .",
    "the rnyi entropy is a schur  concave function for any parameter @xmath45 , what implies that if @xmath39 , then @xmath46 . in general ,",
    "when a given function @xmath47 is schur  concave and two probability vectors satisfy the majorization relation , @xmath39 , one obtains the inequality @xmath48 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our main result  the explicit uncertainty relations for the sum of rnyi entropies is derived in section ii . in section iii we show that the mu bound and the bounds derived in this work are invariant with respect to permutation and dephasing operations . the bounds for some exemplary families of unitary matrices of size @xmath49 are discussed in section iv . in this section",

    "together with maximization over @xmath42 we have @xmath118 thus , we finally obtain the following estimate @xmath119 which gives us the desired majorization relation , @xmath120 in the maximizing case the inequality  ( [ eqn : am - gm - ineq ] ) can be saturated .",
    "this follows from remark  [ remark:2 ] in the appendix , as an optimal choice of the vector @xmath55 implies that both terms in the right hand side of  ( [ eqn : am - gm - ineq ] ) are equal , so the geometric and arithmetic means coincide .",
    "we say that two unitary matrices @xmath28 and @xmath122 are equivalent @xmath123 if there exist permutation matrices @xmath124 and diagonal unitary matrices @xmath125 , such that @xmath126 it is easy to realize , that any unitary matrix is equivalent to one with real elements in the first row and the first column which is often called dephased  @xcite .",
    "another simple fact is that any @xmath80 unitary matrix is equivalent to a real rotation matrix @xmath127    the probability distribution induced by a normalized vector @xmath55 is invariant with respect to diagonal unitary operations .",
    "the permutation matrix changes only the order of coordinates , thus the above equivalence does not affect the left hand side of relation  ( [ eqn : general - eur ] ) .",
