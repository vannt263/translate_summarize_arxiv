    "anomaly mediation of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking in a hidden to the susy standard - model ( susy sm , or ssm ) sector @xcite is very attractive , since it is the simplest mechanism for the mediation of susy breaking .",
    "namely , the anomaly mediation always takes place in a generic susy theory and hence we do not need any extra assumption beside the presence of susy breaking sector to mediate the susy - breaking effects to the ssm sector . without any special requirement on the khler potential , but just by assuming that there is no singlet field in the susy breaking sector , the scenario of anomaly mediation predicts the so - called split susy spectrum @xcite where squarks and sleptons may have masses of the order 10 @xmath3 100 tev while the masses of gauginos are in the range of 100 gev @xmath3 1 tev @xcite.in this letter , we use `` anomaly - mediation model '' for those where gaugino masses are generated by the effect of anomaly mediation while the scalar masses are from tree - level supergravity interaction between observable - sector fields and susy breaking fields . because of the relatively large masses of squarks we need a very precious fine - tuning of parameters to obtain the correct electroweak symmetry breaking , but on the other hand it solves many serious problems in the ssm .",
    "first of all the flavor - changing neutral current and cp - violation problems become very milder due to the large masses of squarks and sleptons .",
    "we may naturally explain no discovery of higgs at lep and no discovery of proton decays induced by dimension - five operators .",
    "furthermore , the gravitino mass is also predicted at the order of 100 tev , which makes the cosmological gravitino problems much less severe @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out that the leptogenesis @xcite does work in the anomaly - mediation model , since the reheating temperature @xmath4 can be as high as @xmath5 gev without any conflict with cosmology @xcite .",
    "although the squarks and sleptons are so heavy , the masses of gauginos may be in the accessible range to the lhc experiments .",
    "thus , even in this model , discovery of the signals from the productions of superparticles may be possible at the lhc .",
    "more importantly , the anomaly - mediation model predicts unique mass relation among gauginos , as we will see in the following .",
    "in particular , the anomaly mediation predicts @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 being the gaugino masses of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 gauge groups , respectively ) in a large region of the parameter space @xcite . in this letter ,",
    "we discuss how the anomaly - mediation model can be studied at the lhc .",
    "let us start our discussion by summarizing basic features of the model .",
    "as we have mentioned in the previous section , we consider the anomaly - mediation model in which all the sfermions as well as heavy higgses and higgsinos are heavy ( of masses of the order of @xmath13 ) . assuming that there is no singlet field in the susy breaking sector , all the gaugino masses are suppressed compared to the susy breaking scalar masses .    in this class of models ,",
    "gaugino masses are mainly from the effect of anomaly mediation and possible radiative correction due to the higgs - higgsino loop @xcite .",
    "then , the susy breaking gaugino mass parameters ( at the scale of sfermion masses @xmath14 ) are obtained as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are gauge coupling constants of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 gauge groups , respectively , and @xmath19 is the gravitino mass .",
    "( hereafter , we use the convention such that @xmath19 is real and positive . ) in addition , @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the ratio of two higgs bosons , and @xmath22 the mass of heavy higgses .",
    "thus , due to the higgs - higgsino loop contribution , gaugino masses may significantly deviate from the pure - anomaly - mediation relation ( which is given by taking @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , since the natural sizes of @xmath24 and @xmath22 are both of the order of the gravitino mass , the @xmath25-parameter is expected to be at most @xmath26 .",
    "( notice that @xmath27 . )",
    "consequently , with a natural choice of @xmath28- and @xmath29-parameters , wino becomes the lightest among gauginos in a large region of the parameter space . in this case , taking account of the radiative correction due to electroweak gauge bosons , neutral wino @xmath30 becomes the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) @xcite .",
    "charged wino @xmath31 becomes slightly heavier than the neutral one ; the mass splitting is as small as @xmath32 .",
    "as we will see , the smallness of the mass splitting has an important implication to the study of the anomaly - mediation model at the lhc .",
    "we should also note that three gaugino masses depend on three parameters : @xmath19 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "even so , non - trivial constraint exists among the gaugino masses . in order to see how the gaugino masses are constrained , it is instructive to approximate the physical ( i.e. , on - shell ) gaugino masses by @xmath35 @xmath3 @xmath36 given in eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) @xmath3 ( [ m3 ] ) .",
    "then , we can see @xmath37 thus , once the wino and gluino masses are fixed , upper and lower bounds on the bino mass are obtained .",
    "( in our quantitative analysis in the following sections , we calculate the bounds more accurately by taking into account the renormalization - group effect below the sfermion - mass scale @xmath14 , taking @xmath38 .",
    "we have checked that the dependence on @xmath14 is rather mild ; the bounds change @xmath39 when @xmath14 is varied in the range @xmath40 . )",
    "it is an important test of the anomaly - mediation model to see if the gauginos satisfy the mass relation .",
    "because the gauginos are the only superparticles kinematically accessible to the lhc , and also because an important information is imprinted in the gaugino masses , we must study the properties of the gauginos at the lhc if the anomaly - mediation model is realized in nature . in the following ,",
    "we discuss how well the gauginos can be investigated at the lhc . as an example , in this letter , we consider the case where the underlying model gives @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( which is given by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) .",
    "notice that the neutral wino is the lsp .",
    "first , we comment on the decay of the charged wino .",
    "since the mass splitting @xmath47 is very small , @xmath31 decays into @xmath30 emitting an extremely soft pion .",
    "thus , it is not easy to identify the decay of the charged wino at the lhc .",
    "in addition , since the typical decay length of @xmath31 is @xmath48 , it is highly challenging to find the track of the charged wino although it may not be impossible .",
    "thus , in our main discussion , we make a conservative assumption that we can not find the charged - wino track ; then both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are treated as invisible particles .",
    "however , we will also discuss the implications of discovering the charged - wino tracks .",
    "= 0.5    the most important production process of superparticles at the lhc is the pair production of gluinos @xmath49 s : @xmath50 , as far as the gluino mass is about @xmath51 or smaller ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2gogo ] we plot the cross section for this process .",
    "when @xmath52 , for example , thousands of supersymmetric events will be available at the lhc with @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 being luminosity ) .",
    "once gluino is produced , it decays into a lighter gaugino ( i.e. , wino @xmath55 or bino @xmath56 ) and standard - model fermions .",
    "if bino @xmath56 is produced by the decay of gluino , it decays successively to wino .",
    "experimental signals strongly depend on how the gauginos decay .",
    "the decay patterns of gauginos are sensitive to the masses of sfermions and higgsinos , and hence are not predictable .",
    "thus , we make several assumptions for our study . for the decay of gluino",
    ", we adopt @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the standard - model quarks .    on the decay of bino , important processes are @xmath59 via bino - wino mixing , @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 being standard - model - like higgs boson ) via bino - higgsino mixing , and @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 being standard - model fermions ) due to sfermion - exchanges . in a large fraction of the parameter space , @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath60 become the dominant decay modes.we thank t. watari for a useful discussion on the bino decay .",
    "if so , however , it is difficult to study the properties of @xmath56 .",
    "then , probably the anomaly - mediation model can be tested only by finding the charged - wino track , which will be challenging , ( as well as by the measurement of @xmath65 , which we discuss below ) .",
    "if there exists a significant hierarchy between sfermion and higgsino masses , however , the last process may dominate .",
    "in particular , if the sleptons are much lighter than higgsino ( by factor @xmath66 or so ) , @xmath67 may acquire a large branching ratio .",
    "as we will see , invariant - mass distribution of @xmath68 gives an important information on the bino mass .",
    "thus , in order to demonstrate what we can learn from the decay mode @xmath69 , we consider a special case where sleptons are much lighter than the higgsino so that the decay modes , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , become negligible . for our simulation , we use @xmath70 where @xmath71 is for the standard - model leptons .      the gluino pair is produced mainly with gluon - gluon collision , and the gluino decays into @xmath55 or @xmath56 with two or four high @xmath72 jets .",
    "therefore the missing transverse energy , @xmath73  , carried away by two winos plus four high @xmath72  jets is the leading experimental signature ( defined as `` no lepton mode '' ) .",
    "also lepton pair from the decays of @xmath56 , four - jet and @xmath73  is the next leading signature of the signal ( defined as `` dilepton mode '' ) .",
    "fraction of the event with dilepton depends strongly on the decay branching fraction , @xmath74 .",
    "the discovery potential will be mainly determined with the no lepton mode and the dilepton mode will be used to measure the mass difference between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the following four standard - model processes can potentially have the event topology of @xmath73   with jets :    * @xmath75 + jets , ( @xmath76 ) * @xmath77 + jets , ( @xmath78 ) * @xmath79 * qcd jets : heavy flavor quarks ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) with semi - leptonic decay and the light flavor jets with mis - measurement .    the high @xmath72  multi - jets are key of the analysis and they should be estimated with the matrix - element calculation .",
    "parton - shower is not good approximation in such a high @xmath72  region and the background contributions would be underestimated  @xcite .",
    "these background processes are generated with alpgen2.05  @xcite , and the exact matrix - element calculations are applied up - to five partons .",
    "the produced 200 m events are fed into the parton - shower generator ( jimmy4.0/herwig6.5  @xcite ) in order to evolute the qcd shower .",
    "multiple - interaction processes are also taken into account . matching between matrix - element and the evaluated parton - shower",
    "are also applied to remove the double counts .",
    "the detector effect is taken into account using the smearing monte carlo simulation of the atlas detector ( atlfast  @xcite ) .",
    "the following simple event selections are applied ,    * number of jets with @xmath72@xmath82 50  gev is larger than or equal to 4 . *",
    "@xmath72  of the jets are required to be larger than 200 and 100  gev for the leading and 2nd leading jets , respectively . *",
    "the missing transverse energy , @xmath73  , is larger than 300  gev .",
    "[ fig : met ] shows the @xmath73  distributions for the no lepton mode .",
    "* the same flavor two leptons with @xmath72@xmath82 20  gev are required for the dilepton mode .",
    "= 0.5    the effective mass , which is define as @xmath73  @xmath83 @xmath72 , is a good variable to discriminate the susy signal from the sm background processes , and figs .",
    "[ fig : meff1 ] show the effective mass distributions of the signal mentioned above and the sm background processes for the no lepton and dilepton modes .",
    "three standard model processes , @xmath75 + jets , @xmath77 + jets , and @xmath84 contribute equally to no lepton mode , but the signal excesses ( with @xmath43 ) will be observed in the high effective mass region . atlas has a discovery potential up - to 1.2  tev with an integrated luminosity of 10  @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath84 process is the dominant background for two lepton mode . since flavor of the selected two leptons are independent in this case , these background processes can be removed easily using the flavor subtraction  @xcite .",
    "= 0.4 = 0.4      now , let us discuss how and how well the gaugino masses can be reconstructed . with the gluino pair production , we obtain , at the parton level , ( i ) four quark jets , and ( ii ) several charged leptons ( or tau jets ) .",
    "the momentum distribution of the quark jets contains an information on @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while that of charged leptons contains that on @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , if we concentrate on the decay of single gluino : @xmath86 , invariant mass of the @xmath87 system @xmath88 is required to be @xmath89 while , for the case of @xmath90 , followed by @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are invariant masses of @xmath87 and @xmath95 systems , respectively . thus , from the invariant - mass distributions , we can extract the information on the gaugino masses .",
    "the same selections mentioned in the previous subsection are applied to make the mass distributions for @xmath88 , @xmath93 and @xmath96 .",
    "the integrated luminosity of 100  @xmath85 is assumed to measure these invariant masses .",
    "the leading four jets are used to make combination of dijets , and there are three possible combinations of four jets , ( 1 + 3 , 2 + 4 ) , ( 1 + 4 , 2 + 3 ) and ( 1 + 2 , 3 + 4 ) .",
    "for example , ( 1 + 3 , 2 + 4 ) means that the leading @xmath72  and 3rd leading jets are considered to be emitted form the same gluino , and 2nd and 4th leading @xmath72  jets have the same parent .",
    "the fractions of the correct combination are the same in the combinations of ( 1 + 3 , 2 + 4 ) and ( 1 + 4 , 2 + 3 ) .",
    "we select the combination in which the difference between two calculated invariant masses of dijets is smaller than the other combination . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of the wrong combination is larger in the ( 1 + 2 , 3 + 4 ) combination , so this combination is used for comparison with the other combinations . the difference between two calculated invariant masses",
    "is required to be smaller than 100  gev in oder to suppress the contamination of @xmath97 .",

    "this shift can be collected with parton - jet calibrations and the uncertainty in this calibration is finally 1%.the calibration of jet energy to parton level will be performed using @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( with @xmath102 and @xmath103 being gluon and photon , respectively ) events , and finally 1% level accuracy will be obtained at atlas detector .",
    "there is also another systematic uncertainty in the fitting procedure .",
    "the other samples with the different mass combinations are also generated , and the same selections and fitting procedure are applied .",

    "systematic uncertainty in the absolute energy calibration is much less than the statistical error .    in order to calculate the invariant mass of dijets and dileptons the corresponding two jets are selected as follows : one of the leading or 2nd leading @xmath72  jet",
    "is selected , which is closer to the dilepton system .",
    "the distance between the dilepton and this jet is also required to be smaller than 2.0 .",

    "if @xmath105 and @xmath106 are both sizable , two mass differences can be reconstructed .",
    "even so , the confirmation of the anomaly - mediation mass spectrum of gauginos is not straightforward because the following questions , which are crucial to test the anomaly - mediation model , are not answered yet .",
    "first , we have seen that the information on mass differences is obtained from the invariant - mass distribution of jets and leptons .",
    "however , it is still an open question how the masses of gauginos can be determined .",
    "in addition , one should note that the event shape from the decay chain @xmath107 followed by @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 ) is hardly distinguished from that from @xmath110 followed by @xmath111 ( or @xmath112 followed by @xmath113 ) , in particular if the track of the charged wino is not observable .",
    "thus , it may not be easy to confirm that wino is the lsp .",
    "for the test of anomaly - mediation model , it is important to answer the following questions :    * how do we determine the masses of gauginos rather than mass differences ? * how do we know that the lightest state is wino , not bino ?    these can be easily answered if the ( short ) tracks of charged wino can be identified at the lhc @xcite . although it is very challenging , such tracks may be seen in the inner detector , like the semiconductor pixel detector and/or the transition radiation tracker ( trt ) . if the tracks of charged winos can be identified , it is obvious that the lightest gaugino is wino , not bino .",
    "in addition , wino mass may be determined by using timing information combined with momentum information on the charged - wino track .",
    "the resolution of the determined @xmath114 is about 0.1 if @xmath114 is less than 0.85 .",
    "so the mass can be determined with accuracy of 10% , if we have enough samples of this exotic track .",
    "even if the information on the charged - wino track is not available , the above questions may still be answered . for the first question ,",
    "one way to determine the gaugino masses is to use the cross - section information on the process @xmath115 .",
    "as one can see in fig.[fig : pp2gogo ] , @xmath116 strongly depends on the gluino mass .",
    "thus , even if the error in the cross section is fairly large , we may still have a useful constraint on the gluino mass .",
    "when the signal number can be determined very roughly with an accuracy of 20  % level , which is the uncertainty of the background , gluino mass can be estimated with an accuracy of 3  % .    in order to discriminate the possibility of bino - lsp",
    ", we may be able to use the drell - yan process @xmath117 .",
    "if the @xmath30 is the lightest neutralino , such a process does not provide any signal . if bino is the lsp , on the contrary , winos produced by this process decay , resulting in events with large missing @xmath118 and possibly multi - leptons . from the negative search for such event",
    ", we may be able to discriminate the possibility of bino - lsp .",
    "another possibility is to tag the flavor of quarks emitted by the decay of gluino , which may be possible for third - generation quarks . in the wino - lsp case",
    ", the following process may occur : @xmath119 while , for the bino - lsp case , @xmath120 .",
    "thus , by identifying the first decay chain using @xmath80-jet tagging , we may be able to confirm that the lsp is wino .",

    ", we may be able to check if the gaugino masses satisfy the mass relation in anomaly - mediation model discussed in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "= 0.5    for this purpose , we first summarize the experimental constraints .",
    "for a given set of gluino masses , we plot the regions allowed by the expected lhc constraints on the @xmath8 vs.  @xmath7 plane . here , based on the discussion given in the previous section , we assume that @xmath121 and @xmath65 can be experimentally determined with the errors of 1  % ( i.e. , 2 gev ) from @xmath93 and 5  % ( i.e. , 40 gev ) from @xmath122 and @xmath98 , respectively .",

    "( see the discussion at the end of section [ sec : model ] . )",
    "one of the crucial test of the anomaly mediation is to see if those three regions overwrap for a gluino mass consistent with experimental constraints .",
    "the gluino mass should be constrained by using the cross section for the process @xmath115 , as discussed in the previous section . if we can experimentally confirm that the gluino production cross section is consistent with the predicted value for the case of @xmath52",
    ", we can conclude that the gaugino mass spectrum is consistent with the prediction of the anomaly - mediation model .",
    "we also note that , in the present case , it is possible to exclude the pure anomaly - mediation model ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) . in the case of pure anomaly mediation",
    ", the wino and bino masses are determined once the gluino mass is fixed .",
    "then , with the precise information on @xmath121 from @xmath93 , prediction of the pure anomaly mediation can be excluded for the underlying parameter used in the current analysis . in general",
    ", accurate determination of @xmath121 will be very useful to exclude ( or confirm ) the prediction of the pure anomaly - mediation model .",
    "in this letter , we have discussed how and how well the anomaly - mediation model can be studied at the lhc . as we have seen , the masses of gluino and wino may be constrained by using invariant - mass distribution of dijet as well as the cross - section information .    on the contrary ,",
    "the bino mass is hardly studied in a large fraction of parameter space since the dominant decay modes of bino are expected to be @xmath64 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , it is very difficult to test the gaugino mass relation in the anomaly - mediation model at the lhc .",

    "in such a case , the mass difference between bino and wino can be well determined by using invariant - mass distribution of dilepton and hence the gaugino - mass relation may be tested .    in any case",
    ", in order to confirm that wino is the lsp , it will be important to find the charged - wino track .",
    "thus , if the excess of  @xmath73  event is observed without the discovery of any sfermions , the search for the short - lived charged - wino track ( with the decay length of @xmath124 ) is strongly suggested .",
