    "single component monolayers of phospholipids or fatty acids at the air - water interface exhibit stable , micron sized domains of coexisting phases @xcite",
    ". such domains have not been observed in single component bilayers , but vesicles consisting of mixtures , such as ternary mixtures of phospholipids , sphingolipids and cholesterol , which have been the subject of intense investigations @xcite , do exhibit stable domains .",
    "most of the natural occurring phospholipids and sphingolipids are zwitterionic @xcite and exhibit a permanent electric dipole moment , which is quite significant , around @xmath0d@xcite . in a monolayer , these dipoles all point in the same direction , with its major component perpendicular to the air - water interface . in single component bilayers , the permanent dipoles in both leaflets point in opposite direction and the membrane",
    "does not have a permanent dipole .",
    "in many important situations , however , the lipid composition within the inner and outer leaflet is asymmetric .",
    "in most cell membranes for example , phosphatidylethanolamine ( pe ) and phosphatidylserine ( ps ) are preferably found in the inner leaflet ( in contact with the cytoplasm ) while sphingomyelin ( sm ) and phosphatidylcholine ( pc ) are more abundant in the outer leaflet@xcite leading to a permanent dipole density for the membrane , similarly as in monolayers .",
    "in fact , it is well established that a difference in electric potential across a membrane due to dipolar potentials is quite significant , between 100 mv and 400 mv , and that this potential difference is extremely important for a variety of biological processes @xcite .",
    "what is the effect of domains contained in a matrix with a different dipole density ? in a series of papers andelman et al .",
    "@xcite and mcconnell and collaborators @xcite have provided theoretical and experimental evidence that dipolar domains in monolayers have a profound effect in the phase diagram , as the electrostatic free energy cost of assembling such domains limits its size , preventing the monolayer from reaching complete phase separation . in their original calculation ,",
    "mcconnell and collaborators did not consider several effects that are potentially relevant , such as a finite ionic strength , the inclusion of image charges and the polarizability of the dipoles .",
    "those effects were considered by andelman et al .",
    "@xcite for geometries consisting of stripes .",
    "furthermore , in view of the importance of lipid domains in membranes , it is of great interest to analyze how dipole density inhomogeneities may affect the phase diagram @xcite , similarly as it is the case for simple monolayers at the air - water interface . in this paper , we generalize the calculation by mcconnell and collaborators for circular domains to include finite ionic strength , image charges and the polarizability of the dipoles and further extend the results to dipolar domains in bilayers .        the phase diagram of lipid mixtures is a result of the microscopic characteristics of the lipids involved such as hydrocarbon chain and length as well as degree of saturation , possibility of forming hydrogen bonds , etc .. it is expected that the effect of these interactions is parameterized on longer scales by quantities such as a line tension @xmath1 between coexisting domains , a spontaneous curvature @xmath2 of the different phospholipid species , the membrane surface tension @xmath3 or its bending rigidity @xmath4 ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the incorporation of the microscopic permanent dipoles of the lipids in these long wavelength descriptions is subtle . as an example , let us consider a bilayer containing a circular domain with non - zero dipolar density within a matrix of an hypothetical dipole free lipid , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] . the electrostatic free energy cost of such domain can be estimated in analogy with the monolayer case @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the size of the domain .",
    "if the coefficient @xmath7 were vanishingly small , the net electrostatic cost of the dipoles grows with the perimeter of the domain and may be lumped into a `` renormalized '' line tension contribution . for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] , however , the coefficient @xmath7 is not negligible , and the free energy contribution of the permanent dipoles must be considered explicitly . in some other situations , however",
    ", the coefficient @xmath7 may vanish .",
    "it seems plausible that if the domain in fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] was opposed by an identical domain of the same lipid , the membrane would not exhibit a permanent dipole moment and the electrostatic contribution would consist of a short - ranged interaction that might be incorporated into the line tension .",
    "furthermore , ionic strength , by weakening the electrostatic interactions , can also influence domain sizes .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed quantitative analysis for these questions .    in all previous treatments of dipolar domains ( such as @xcite and",
    "all subsequent work ) , the free energy has been computed by directly summing over dipoles . in this paper",
    ", we will consider two oppositely charged sheets and obtain the free energy of the dipoles as the first non - trivial coefficient in the limit of small sheet separation .",

    "[ fig : phse_diagram ] ; for lipid monolayers at the air - water interface it is found that the size of the lipid domains is independent of the ionic strength , but is sensitive to the discontinuities in dielectric constant and the polarizability of the dipoles . in lipid vesicles",

    "it has also been shown that small variations in dipolar density ( 2@xmath126 or more from the equilibrium dipole density of a zwitterionic phospholipid ) are enough to limit domain sizes to sub - micron scales .",
    "opposite to the situation with monolayers , dipolar domains in bilayers are sensitive to solution ionic strength . at small debye lengths , of the order of the domain radius at zero ionic strength ,",
    "dipolar electrostatic effects gradually become negligible and the system is dominated by line tension , resulting in a single large circular minority domain if the line tension is positive .",
    "our study has been focused on the limiting cases of high and low ionic strength , but exact analytic expressions have been provided for the free energy and the electric potential .",
    "problems that have not been discussed in this paper , such as values for domain radius at intermediate ionic strength , ionic distributions or potential differences across the interface also follow from these expressions .",
    "our results show the subtle role played by the intrinsic dipoles in lipids membranes . at high ionic strength ,",
    "the effect of dipoles is short - ranged , but at low ionic strength dipolar interactions are only negligible for symmetric domains , and in any other situation , dipolar interactions must be included explicitly , either in continuum models @xcite or in numerical simulations @xcite .",

    "our study includes the effects of a net dipolar moment and the dielectric constant of water .",
    "more importantly , it shows that at high ionic strength the effect of dipolar interactions is short - ranged . other theoretical work",
    "@xcite has discussed interfaces within the framework of the debye - huckel approximation , the same approximation used in this study , but has been focused on effective interactions between charges , so these results are somewhat complementary to the ones presented here .",
    "a number of situations have not been considered in this paper .",
    "our study has been restricted to circular domains , while other shapes , such as stripes , are also of interest @xcite .",

    "problems where dipolar - like domains , similar to the ones considered in this paper , have been discussed in other contexts . the free energy describing the phase transition between a fermi liquid and an insulating wigner crystal phase in a clean two dimensional electron can be mapped to a dipolar interaction and a line tension term . after a detailed analysis",
    ", the authors in @xcite showed that a direct first order phase transition can not occur , and instead , it was shown that the transition should proceed as a sequence of intermediate `` microemulsion''phases , consisting of domains of one phase within a matrix of the other phase .",
    "our results are in complete agreement with @xcite , but show that a direct first order transition can be obtained as a function of the debye length , if the electrostatic interactions are screened .",
    "previous md simulations @xcite have shown that transitions from triangular superlattices to striped domains are a general feature resulting from increasing the strength of a short - ranged attraction force with respect to a long range repulsion . upon identifying the short - range attraction with the line tension and the long range repulsion with the dipolar interactions , these results are qualitatively similar to the problems studied in this paper .",
    "it seems therefore that `` microemulsion''phases are a common feature of systems near a phase transition consisting of a long range repulsion and short a range attraction .",
    "in fact , this has been shown rigorously for general 2d coulomb systems @xcite .",
    "another interesting example is provided by heteroepitaxial growth of 2d islands in solid surfaces , where the elastic free energy cost of assembling an island also contains a logarithmic term ( completely analogous with the dipolar case studied in this paper ) and competes against the line tension . in @xcite , it was shown that the addition of domain - domain interactions in the form of dipolar interactions leads to the formation of triangular superlattices .",
    "these results show that interactions among finite circular domains are responsible for the formation of superlattice structures of circular domains , whose size can be computed from balancing elastic ( or dipolar ) free energy against line tension , and provide yet another example illustrating the expected general results of phase separations in systems with long range interactions .",
