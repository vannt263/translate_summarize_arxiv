    "oxide perovskites with the general formula abo@xmath0 , in which a and b denote different cations , can undergo abrupt structural , magnetic , and electronic changes upon application of small external fields ( e. g. , electric , magnetic , and mechanical ) and variation of temperature  [ ] . this singular reactivity converts oxide perovskites in excellent candidate materials for developing new information storage and energy conversion technologies .",
    "one illustrative example is the design of spintronic devices , in which spin - polarised electric currents are generated with electromagnetic fields or through spin - injection from a ferromagnetic material , in order to exploit the magnetic degree of freedom of electrons  [ ] . in this latter context ,",
    "ferromagnetic metallic perovskites appear to be especially valuable as they can be employed directly as electrodes in complex oxide heterostructures .",
    "srcoo@xmath6 is a ferromagnetic metallic perovskite in which significant structural , electronic , and magnetic order changes occur as its content of oxygen is varied ( @xmath7 )  [ ] . in stoichiometric samples ( @xmath8 ) the crystalline phase that has been repeatedly reported as the ground state is the perovskite @xmath4 structure , which exhibits ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin order at temperatures below @xmath9  k  [ ] .",
    "experiments and theoretical calculations have assuredly shown that srcoo@xmath0 possesses an intermediate spin ( is ) state with a magnetic moment of @xmath10 per co ion  [ ] . in non - stoichiometric samples with high oxygen deficiency ( @xmath11 ) the system adopts the brownmillerite phase , which presents atomically ordered one - dimensional vacancy channels and antiferromagnetic ( a ) spin order at temperatures below @xmath12  k  [ ] .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the content of oxygen in srcoo@xmath6 thin films can be effectively tuned by means of epitaxial strain  [ ] . this control of oxygen non - stoichiometry offers a promising new route for designing multifunctional oxide materials with improved electrochemical , magnetoresistance , and catalytic properties .",
    "interestingly , lee and rabe have identified srcoo@xmath0 thin films as good candidate materials in which to observe large magnetoelectric effects , that is , a strong coupling between polar and magnetic degrees of freedom , based on the results of first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations  [ ] .",
    "specifically , it has been predicted that simultaneous magnetic - ferroelectric and metal - insulator transitions could be induced in srcoo@xmath0 by means of moderate tensile and compressive epitaxial strains .",
    "if confirmed , these results could advance the development of low - power high - efficiency electronic and energy conversion technologies .    here",
    ", we present a revision of the zero - temperature phase diagram of stoichiometric srcoo@xmath0 ( sco ) , both in bulk and thin film geometries , using a wide variety of first - principles dft techniques ( i. e. , lda+u , gga+u and hybrid exchange - correlation functionals ) .",
    "our computational analysis consistently shows that , rather than the well - known cubic @xmath4 phase , a tetragonal @xmath1 phase with moderate jahn - teller distortions and a @xmath2 ratio of @xmath3 is the energetically most favorable phase in bulk sco at zero temperature .",
    "we arrived at the same conclusion also when considering the application of hydrostatic pressures of up to @xmath13  gpa .",
    "this central outcome either calls for a revision of previous crystallographic analysis performed in sco at low temperatures , or well it represents a failure of dft methods in describing the competition among crystalline phases in this highly correlated material .",
    "we have also investigated the energy , magnetic , and electronic properties of sco thin films in a wide interval of epitaxial strains , @xmath14%  @xmath15% ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the in - plane equilibrium distance between cations of the same species ) , using computational techniques similar to those employed by lee and rabe ( i. e. , dft gga+u )  [ ] .",
    "our results show a phase - transition scenario that is compatible with recent experimental observations but appreciably different from the one proposed previously . actually , our findings lower the expectations of realising large magnetoelectricity in stoichiometric sco thin films .",
    "the organisation of this article is as it follows . in the following section we provide an overview of the computational methods employed in this study .",

    "in order to accurately describe the physical properties of srcoo@xmath0 it is necessary to use methods that go beyond standard dft , e. g. , gga+u ( or lda+u ) and hybrid functionals , as due to the presence of strongly correlated @xmath24 electrons .",
    "the gga+u approximation is based on a hubbard - type hamiltonian approach in which an on - site constant effective potential is introduced to account for the intra - atomic electron coulomb repulsive ( @xmath25 ) and intra - orbital exchange potential ( @xmath26 )  [ ] . here we employ the gga+u ( and lda+u ) scheme due to dudarev  [ ] for a better treatment of co s @xmath27 electrons ; the meaningful term in this approach is u@xmath28 , to which we refer hereafter simply as to u. the choice of the u value , however , is not unique or rigorously well defined . in general , this is selected so as to reproduce a particular set of experimental data ( e. g. , lattice parameters or energy band gaps ) or theoretical results obtained with higher accuracy methods as closely as possible  [ ] .",
    "hybrid functionals represent a good alternative to dft+u approximations . in this context ,",
    "one mixes a particular amount of nonlocal hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange , @xmath29 , with standard density functional ( either lda or gga ) exchange potentials .",
    "the resulting hybrid dft exchange - correlation potential can be expressed as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent exchange and correlation functionals , respectively .",
    "in contrast to gga+u and lda+u , hydrid functionals account for both the electronic localisation acting on all the states of the system and nonlocal exchange effects . yet , in a strict _ ab initio _ sense , there is not a general prescription for chosing the right amount of nonlocal hf exchange .    in this work ,",
    "we have used both the gga+u ( lda+u ) and hybrid functional approaches .",
    "next , we explain the technical details of our calculations .",
    "in most of our calculations we used the generalised gradient approximation to density functional theory ( dft ) proposed by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe )  [ ] , as it is implemented in the vasp package  [ ] .",
    "other common exchange - correlation functional approximations such as lda  [ ] and pbe@xmath33  [ ] were also considered .",

    "the wave functions were expanded in a plane - wave basis truncated at @xmath40  ev , and a @xmath41 simulation cell containing up to @xmath42 atoms was used in most of our energy and geometry relaxation calculations ( see fig .  [",

    "geometry relaxations were performed using a conjugate - gradient algorithm that varied the shape and in some cases also the volume of the unit cell ; the imposed tolerance on the atomic forces was @xmath47  ev@xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "high - pressure equations of state were determined by computing the total energy of the crystal in a series of volume points that subsequently were fitted to analytical birch - murnaghan functions  [ ] .",
    "we also calculated the vibrational phonon spectrum of several bulk phases by using the `` direct method ''  [ ] and dft calculations . in the direct method",
    ", the force - constant matrix of the crystal is calculated in real - space by considering the proportionality between atomic displacements and forces when the former are sufficiently small .",
    "large supercells need to be constructed in order to guarantee that the elements of the force - constant matrix have all fallen off to negligible values at their boundaries , a condition that follows from the use of periodic boundary conditions  [ ] .",
    "once the force - constant matrix is calculated one can fourier - transform it to obtain the phonon spectrum at any @xmath50-point .",
    "the quantities with respect to which our phonon calculations need to be converged are the size of the supercell , the size of the atomic displacements , and the numerical accuracy in the sampling of the brillouin zone .",

    "the value of the phonon frequencies were obtained with the phon code developed by alf  [ ] . in using this code we exploited the translational invariance of the system to impose the three acoustic branches to be exactly zero at the @xmath43 @xmath50-point , and used central differences in the atomic forces ( i. e. , positive and negative atomic displacements were considered ) .",
    "hybrid functional dft calculations were performed with the replicated - data version of the crystal14 package  [ ] . this is a first - principles electronic structure software which employs atom - centered gaussian - type orbital ( gto ) basis sets to build bloch functions that represent the one - electron crystalline orbitals .",
    "gto offer a number of convenient computational features , e. g. , the use of local basis sets containing minimal overlap with neighboring orbitals , that allow to perform hf exchange calculations in medium and large size systems affordably ( e. g. , the resulting computational expense scales as @xmath55 with the number of particles , to be compared with the usual @xmath56 scaling found in plane - waves based methods ) .",
    "all - electron gto atomic basis sets were chosen as it follows : for co s we used the double - zeta all - electron basis set from  [ ] ; for sr s small - core hay - wadt pseudopotentials  [ ] were adopted for the description of the inner - shell electrons @xmath57 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath58 , @xmath34 , and @xmath27 , while for the valence part @xmath35 , @xmath37 , and @xmath36 we used the optimized basis set successfully applied to the strontium titanate study  [ ] ; and for o s we used the @xmath59 all - electron basis set constructed by cor  [ ] .",

    "as pressure is increased beyond @xmath123  gpa , the system displaying fm spin order clearly becomes the one with the lowest energy . according to our calculations ,",
    "this magnetic spin order phase transformation is accompanied by a very small volume reduction of @xmath124  % , in which the volume of the a - a phase is @xmath125  @xmath126 .    in view of our zero - temperature results obtained in bulk srcoo@xmath114 under pressure , yang _",

    "( we note that none of these low - energy structures was considered by lee and rabe in works [ ] . )",
    "such a fierce phase competition appears to be comparable to that found in archetypal multiferroic compounds like , for instance , bifeo@xmath0  [ ] . meanwhile , at small epitaxial strain conditions phases displaying a - c and a - g magnetic spin orders are found to be energetically noncompetitive , made the exception of the tetragonal @xmath1 phase ( a - c case ) .    at @xmath147  %",
    ", we found that the tetragonal ground - state phase undergoes a magnetic phase transition from fm to a - c ( see vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this is a continuous and isostructural phase transformation . in order to identify possible electronic - structure changes associated to this transition",
    ", we calculated the @xmath24-orbital pdos in the two relevant @xmath1 phases ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "our results suggest a change from an intermediate spin state in the fm phase to a low spin state in the a - a phase , as in the latter case no energy band gap appears in the spin - down channel .",
    "likewise , along the tensile strain - induced phase transition the system is likely to improve its electrical conductivity properties rather than to becoming an insulator ( in contrast to the @xmath148 transformation suggested in  [ ] , which renders an insulator and ferroelectric compound at @xmath149  % ) .",
    "our predictions appear to be consistent with recent experimental observations reported by callori _",
    "et al . _  [ ] and hu _ et al .",
    "nevertheless , new experimental studies characterising in detail the structural and electronic features of sco thin films at moderate tensile strains appear to be necessary for clarifying the discrepancies found between ours and previous dft results  [ ] .    at @xmath150  %",
    ", we found that the system transforms into a tetragonal @xmath128 phase displaying a - c spin order and a large @xmath2 ratio of @xmath151 ( see vertical dashed lines in fig .  [ fig8 ] ) . in order to identify possible electronic - structure changes associated to this transition , we calculated the @xmath24-orbital pdos in the two involved tetragonal phases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "our analysis reveals that sco @xmath128 ( a - c ) thin films are insulator and also ferroelectric , in particular they exhibit a large out - of - plane electrical polarisation of @xmath152  @xmath153c / m@xmath154 ( as it has been estimated with the methods explained in work  [ ] ) .",
    "the predicted phase transition , therefore , involves a three - fold structural , magnetic , and ferroelectric transformation ; however , in spite of its fundamental and technological interests , it requires of so large compressive strains that it would be hardly realisable in practice ( in contrast to the multiferroic phase transformation predicted by lee and rabe at @xmath155  % [ ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , we found that for the same type of phase transformation to occur in nonstoichiometric sco thin films ( i. e. , srcoo@xmath104 ) a smaller critical epitaxial strain of @xmath156  %   is needed .",
    "magnetoelectric effects then are probably more likely to be observed in nonstoichiometric than in stoichiometric sco samples .",
    "we have presented a throughout revision of the zero - temperature phase diagram of stoichiometric srcoo@xmath0 that is obtained with first - principles methods based on density functional theory ( i. e. , gga+u and hybrid functionals ) . in the bulk case , we have identified a tetragonal @xmath1 phase with moderate jt distortions and a @xmath2 ratio of @xmath3 as the ground state of the system . the same phase remains the most stable as hydrostatic pressures of up to @xmath157  gpa are applied .",
    "this central result either calls for a revision of previous crystallographic analysis performed in sco at low temperatures , or well it represents a failure of dft methods in describing such a highly correlated oxide compound . in sco thin films ,",
    "we have found two phase transitions occurring at moderate tensile and large compressive epitaxial strains ( i. e. , @xmath129  % and @xmath158  % , respectively ) . according to our calculations , the first transformation is isostructural and comprises only a change in magnetic spin order .",
    "the second transition , on the contrary , involves a three - fold structural , magnetic , and polar transformation ; however , the critical epitaxial strain associated to this transition is so large that it appears to be irrealisable in practice .",
    "the general description of sco thin films that follows from our study appears to be consistent with recent experimental observations , however , it differs considerably from previously reported dft gga+u results .",
    "the main reason behind such a disagreement is likely to be related to the choice of the u value , which as we have shown has an important effect on the description of electronic and magnetic spin degrees of freedom .",
    "new and systematic experiments on stoichiometric sco , both in bulk and thin film geometries , certainly are necessary in order to advance our knowledge of this intriguing material .",
