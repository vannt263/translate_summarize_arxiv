    "[ image_mos ] ) . in spite of the significant degradation in the sensitivity of the epic cameras at high offset angles ,",
    "the statistics ( more than 3000 counts in each observation ) were sufficient for a detailed spectral and timing analysis .",
    "we reduced epic data with the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas v 5.3 ) .",
    "we performed standard screening of the epic data to exclude time intervals with high background levels . to generate lightcurves and spectra of the source",

    "the resulting @xmath28 upper limit on an increase in neutral absorbing column density @xmath49 during the dips is @xmath50 ( assuming a single spectral component ) .",
    "however , if the dips are caused by electron scattering in a cloud along the line of sight , the electron column density must be @xmath51 @xmath52 ( @xmath53 dipping ) and @xmath54 @xmath52 ( @xmath55 dipping ) for 2002 jan . 6 and 2000 jun .",
    "25 observations respectively .",
    "it should be mentioned that the comptonization model which fits the spectrum during the intensity dips does not provide a unique determination of the spectral form .",
    "other complex models ( e.g. two - component models with different low - energy absorption column densities ) also give acceptable fits .",
    "the low statistical significance of the data does not allow us to discriminate between these models .",
    "there is an anti - correlation between the average amplitude of the modulation and the source intensity on a long time scale .",

    "6 observation , @xmath55 in 2000 jun .",
    "25 observation and @xmath56 in 2001 jun .",
    "29 observation , corresponding to the source luminosities of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ergs s@xmath45 respectively .",
    "in addition , a dependence of the dip strength upon the luminosity on a time scale of hours was marginally detected during the 2000 jun .",
    "25 observation .",
    "we have discovered a @xmath60-hour periodic dip - like modulation with variable amplitude in the x - ray flux of the globular cluster candidate source bo 158 in m31 .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation is anticorrelated with source intensity : it becomes lower with increasing x - ray flux .",
    "the most interesting feature of this modulation is its lack of energy dependence .",
    "if the @xmath60-hour modulation represents the binary period , @xmath61 , the binary separation is @xmath62 cm . is a mass of the compact object in solar units and @xmath63 is a mass ratio of the secondary star and a compact object ] the association of the source with a globular cluster , and spectral parameters consistent with galactic neutron star sources , suggest that the compact object in bo158 is probably a neutron star in a low - mass binary .",
    "this implies a highly compact binary with separation @xmath64 cm .",
    "although there are similarities between the light curve of bo 158 and the galactic binary cygnus x-3 , it is unlikely that these systems have a common nature . the broad minimum in the 4.8-hour cycle of cygnus x-3 is explained as variable scattering in the dense photoionized wind of a wolf - rayet companion ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in contrast to bo 158 , the amplitude of x - ray modulation in cygnus x-3 is extremely stable in spite of drastic changes in luminosity .",
    "the duration of the intensity dips in phase is similar to those seen in some galactic lmxb dipping sources such as x1755 - 338 ( @xcite ) , xb1254 - 690 ( @xcite ) and xb 1916 - 053 ( @xcite ) , although bo 158 is much more luminous .",
    "the lack of energy dependence of the modulation is a common feature of a number of dipping sources .",
    "the dips in these systems are believed to be caused by absorption and scattering in an obscuring medium , i.e. a bulge or thickened region of the accretion disk , or inhomogeneities in the mass transfer stream ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the dips in bo 158 are caused by an obscuring structure , at least two explanations could be proposed to explain the energy independence of the intensity dips : i ) the obscuring material is highly ionized ( @xcite ) ; ii ) the dips are caused by partial covering of an extended source ( @xcite ) .",
    "\\(i ) if the obscuring structure is located close to the x - ray emission region , the obscuring medium could be strongly ionized .",
    "the compactness and high x - ray luminosity of bo 158 could imply a high ionization in the region responsible for the dips .",
    "the obscuring matter in the galactic dipping sources , with their smaller luminosities ( @xmath65 ergs s@xmath45 ) , is less strongly ionized . for the material causing the dips to be completely ionized , the ionization parameter @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is the central source luminosity",
    ", @xmath68 is the gas density of the cloud , and @xmath69 is the distance from the central source to the obscuring medium)(@xcite ) should be larger than @xmath70 ergs cm s@xmath45 . for the 2002 jan . 6 observation , an average @xmath71 intensity reduction requires a column , @xmath72 , of @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "assuming an out - of - dip luminosity of bo 158 to be @xmath57 ergs s@xmath45 , and following mason et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , we conclude that all material closer than @xmath73 cm , @xmath74 is the scattering column length ] will be highly ionized .",
    "another estimate of the ionization stage of the obscuring medium is based on the duration of the intensity dips ( @xcite ) . for @xmath75 s , assuming that the absorbing medium is roughly spherical and fixed in the frame of the binary , @xmath76 . to obtain @xmath77 , the ionized region must be closer than @xmath78 cm ( 2002 jan .",
    "6 observation ) and @xmath79 cm ( 2000 jun .",
    "25 observation ) .",
    "the absorbing medium in a 2.78-hour binary could fall well within these limits , and be highly ionized .",
    "\\(ii ) for an opaque absorber to produce broad dips , the emission region must be extended and the eclipse partial .",
    "the source could be a scattering corona - like structure , and/or thick disk / outflow located close to the compact object , and the absorber a thickened region of accretion disk , or a mass transfer stream from the companion star .",
    "the diminution of the modulation with increase of the x - ray flux could indicate a decrease of the obscured fraction of the emission region , caused by increasing the size of the emitter or decreasing the size of the absorber .",
