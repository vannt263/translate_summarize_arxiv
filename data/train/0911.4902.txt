    "the charge independence of nuclear force gives rise to isospin symmetry @xcite and the formalism of isotopic spin has proven to be a very powerful concept in nuclear physics @xcite . while useful , isospin symmetry is not perfectly conserved . on the hadronic level , isospin is weakly violated due to the difference in the masses of the up and down quarks @xcite .",

    "however , for nuclear states close to , or above the reaction thresholds , the isospin breaking can be modified by the coupling to the particle continuum . here , a spectacular example is the thomas - ehrman ( te ) effect @xcite that occurs when one of the mirror states is unstable against particle emission due to a large asymmetry between proton and neutron emission thresholds .",
    "the resulting te energy shifts strongly depend on the angular momentum content of the nuclear state and can be fairly large for low partial waves @xcite .",
    "the te effect has also a direct consequence for the structure of mirror wave functions @xcite .",

    "the latter leads to the universal behavior of cross sections @xcite and spectroscopic factors ( sfs ) @xcite in the vicinity of a reaction threshold .",
    "recently , sfs and asymptotic normalization coefficients have been discussed in mirror systems within cluster approaches @xcite , and strong mirror symmetry - breaking in mirror sfs has been predicted .",
    "the main focus of this work is on the isospin mixing and mirror symmetry breaking in the isobaric analog states ( ias ) of light nuclei .",

    "namely , @xmath70=1.015@xmath145i0.177 for the g.s .  and @xmath70=0.978@xmath145i0.016 for the @xmath148 state . the v2 values of sfs in the 0@xmath149 state of @xmath4li are @xmath70=1.028@xmath145i0.300 ( @xmath146 ) and @xmath70=0.898@xmath145i0.369 ( @xmath147 ) , while for the @xmath0=1 2@xmath3 state they are : @xmath70=0.993@xmath145i3.190@xmath14310@xmath144 ( @xmath146 ) and @xmath70=1.043@xmath145i0.0224 .",
    "this can be seen from table  [ table1 ] by comparing the corresponding gsm wave function amplitudes for @xmath4be ( columns 4 and 5 ) and @xmath4li ( columns 6 and 7 ) .    while their mean values differ by about 15% , considering large imaginary parts , the sfs predicted for the @xmath150=0@xmath3 iass of the isotriplet , agree within calculated uncertainty .",
    "however , by examining the gsm wave function amplitudes displayed in table  [ table1 ] , one notes that sfs , being integrated measures , do not tell the whole story .",
    "the main effect of the coulomb interaction is the change in distribution of the @xmath151 and @xmath152 g.s .",
    "components , the latter involving one particle in the non - resonant @xmath37 continuum . as a result ,",
    "a rather different interference pattern between the resonant @xmath38 state and the non - resonant continuum is predicted for @xmath4he and @xmath4be , and between resonant and non - resonant states of a different type ( proton or neutron ) in @xmath4li .    for the @xmath124 iass ,",
    "a meaningful comparison of sfs can be done as they have small imaginary parts .",
    "this is a consequence of the smaller configuration mixing induced by the nuclear interaction . indeed , as shown in table  [ table2 ] , the structure of @xmath124 states is dominated by the resonant @xmath151 component . here",
    "we conclude that gsm predicts a mirror symmetry - breaking in sfs of the order of @xmath153 .",
    "to assess the impact of the recoil term on our findings , we carried out calculations in which the recoil of the core is ignored . in this case ,",
    "the coupling constants refitted to the data are @xmath154 mev@xmath126 and @xmath155 mev@xmath126 , while the depth of the proton ws potential is now 47.5mev . without recoil ,",
    "energy observables are very similar to those obtained in full calculations .",
    "namely , for @xmath4he , only the width of the first excited state differs by a few kev , as it becomes @xmath156 kev . the energy and width of the @xmath4be g.s .  in v2",
    "remain the same as with recoil , while there appears a small change for the first excited state of @xmath4be : @xmath157 mev and @xmath158 mev . for @xmath4li ,",
    "the energy of the 0@xmath3 state differs by a few kev in v1 and around 20 kev in v2 , while the width remains practically unchanged . for the 2@xmath3 state in @xmath4li , changes are of the order of tens of kev .",
    "the changes in sfs due to recoil are small as well . to show it explicitly , in table  [ table1 ] we compare the gsm amplitudes of the ground - state wave function of @xmath4he in the cosm variant ( second column ) and assuming the rigid @xmath7he core ( third column ) .",
    "the main effect of recoil is to slightly redistribute partial wave occupations , in particular the @xmath159 contribution .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath4he g.s . , the sum of the square of amplitudes belonging to the @xmath159 channel is 6@xmath160 without recoil , while it is 3.2@xmath161 with the full treatment of recoil . for @xmath4be ,",
    "not shown in table  [ table1 ] , these numbers in v2 translate to 4.2@xmath160 and 3.1@xmath161 , respectively .",
    "there is also a small increase of amplitudes in other continuum channels , e.g. , @xmath162 but those wave function components are very small .",
    "another way of assessing the degree of isospin mixing is by inspecting the structure of ias within the isomultiplet . to this end",
    ", we carried out calculations for the isotriplet @xmath4he , @xmath4li , and @xmath4be in v1+cosm using the common neutron s.p .",
    "basis of @xmath4he . in this way , the isospin operator @xmath163 is properly defined @xcite .",
    "the numerical error due to the use of neutron s.p . basis on the ground state energy of @xmath4be is very small : it is about 20 kev for the real energy and 5 kev for the with , and this accuracy is more than sufficient for the purpose of our ias analysis .",
    "the isobaric analogs of the @xmath0=1 states in @xmath4he are given by :    [ iastates ] @xmath164 ) .",
    "for the 0@xmath3 state of @xmath4li , the squared overlap is @xmath165 = 0.995 .",
    "this indicates that the lowest @xmath123 state in @xmath4li is indeed an excellent isobaric analog of @xmath4he g.s .",
    "indeed , the corresponding average isospin value @xcite : @xmath166 is @xmath167=0.9994 .    for the ground state of @xmath4be , @xmath168=0.951i0.050 , i.e. , the mean value of the squared amplitude exhibits a reduction with respect to the perfect isospin invariance .",
    "this result is consistent with the large difference between gsm wave functions of @xmath4he and @xmath4be : a significant component of the @xmath4be g.s .",
    "wave function corresponds to a non - resonant continuum of @xmath4he .",
    "interestingly , the total isospin of @xmath4be states is perfectly conserved in our gsm space . indeed , having two valence protons , wave functions of @xmath4be",
    "are completely aligned in isospace , _",
    "regardless _ of the strength of coulomb interaction .",
    "the isospin breaking in @xmath4be can only happen through core polarization effects , i.e. , core - breaking excitations @xcite .",
    "since @xmath7he is a very rigid core , one expects a fairly pure isospin in the low - lying states of @xmath4be .",
    "a similar situation is expected for any isospin - aligned shell - model state corresponding to a semi - magic nucleus having @xmath169 valence protons ( or @xmath170 neutrons ) .",
    "if one disregards core - breaking effects , such a state has pure isospin @xmath171 ( or @xmath172 ) , in spite of the presence of inc interactions that manifestly break isospin .",
    "this is a nice example of a more general phenomenon called partial dynamical symmetry , i.e. , a symmetry that is obeyed by a subset of eigenstates , but is not shared by the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we note that while @xmath173 and @xmath174 are preserved in the isospin - aligned states , this is not the case for @xmath175 operators connecting @xmath4be with @xmath4li and @xmath4li with @xmath4he , that are affected by isospin mixing .",
    "there are several sources of isospin ( and mirror ) symmetry - breaking in atomic nuclei . probably the most elusive",
    "are consequences of the threshold effect @xcite and the coulomb - nuclear interference effect @xcite .",
    "the open quantum system formulation of the gsm makes it possible to address the question of the continuum - induced isospin symmetry - breaking in a comprehensive and non - perturbative way , in terms of the configuration mixing involving bound and unbound states .",
    "as compared to previous gsm studies , present calculations are based on a newly developed finite - range residual interaction msgi . the coulomb interaction and",
    "recoil term are treated by means of the ho expansion technique .",
    "the stability of this expansion has been numerically checked with a very encouraging result : with only nine ho states per partial wave , one obtains excellent convergence for both energies and wave functions .",
    "to study the sensitivity of results to the cm treatment , we carried out two sets of calculations : one in cosm coordinates in which the core recoil is treated exactly and another one assuming no recoil .",
    "we find that the results of both variants are very close for both energies and sfs ; hence , the details of cm treatment do not impact the conclusions of our work .",
    "we have shown that the energy dependence of sfs of mirror nuclei is different .",
    "realistic estimates for the isotriplet @xmath4he and @xmath4be yield an effect in sfs of the 2@xmath3 state which is in a range of several percent .",
    "this is consistent with results of recent cluster - model studies @xcite . for the @xmath123 configuration",
    ", the situation is different . here",
    ", the mean values of sfs differ by about 16% and a different interference pattern between the resonant @xmath38 components and the non - resonant @xmath37 continuum is predicted .",
    "however , due to appreciable imaginary parts , hence large uncertainty , g.s .",
    "sfs in @xmath4he and @xmath4be , and sfs for the 0@xmath3 analog state in @xmath4li , calculated in gsm do not offer a clear measure of the mirror symmetry - breaking .",
    "the behavior of sfs in @xmath4li follows that predicted for @xmath4he and @xmath4be .",
    "interestingly , proton spectroscopic factors show the presence of threshold anomalies due to the strong coupling with the neutron channel .    due to the partial dynamical isospin symmetry present in the gsm wave functions of @xmath4be , the low - lying states in this isospin - stretched ( @xmath0=1 , @xmath176=1 ) system",
    "are expected to show very weak isospin breaking effects .",
    "this is in spite of coulomb interaction present in this nucleus . for the @xmath176=0 member of the isotriplet , @xmath4li ,",
    "the isospin symmetry is explicitly broken in the gsm space as a result of mixing between @xmath0=0 and @xmath0=1 states but the resulting mixing is very weak .",
    "we thus conclude that the large mirror symmetry breaking effects seen in binding energies and sfs of the isotriplet are related to @xmath175 components rather than the total isospin .    in summary , the coupling to the non - resonant continuum can give rise to isospin and mirror symmetry - breaking effects that are configuration dependent .",
    "explanations of mirror symmetry breaking based on the traditional close quantum system formulation of the nuclear shell model sometimes invoke inc _ nuclear _ effective interactions @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that any attempt to extract such interactions from spectroscopic data should first account for the coupling to the many - body continuum in the presence of isospin - conserving nuclear forces .",
    "if neglected , or not treated carefully , the continuum effects can alter results of such analyses .",
