    "let @xmath1 be a noncompact surface without boundary of class @xmath2 , endowed with a smooth complete riemannian metric @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 a green s function of @xmath1 , which is defined as a symmetric function ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) that satisfies the equation @xmath6 for each @xmath7 . that is to say , if one considers the action of the laplace",
    " beltrami operator of the manifold , @xmath8 , on the green s function @xmath9 ( with respect to the first variable  @xmath10 ) , one obtains a dirac measure supported at the point @xmath11 .    our goal in this paper is to analyze the dynamical properties of the gradient of the green s function . for this",
    ", we will find it notationally convenient to fix a point @xmath7 , once and for all , and use the notation @xmath12 for the green s function with pole @xmath11 , which is smooth and harmonic in @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the gradient field we will study in this paper will be @xmath14 .",
    "the study of green s functions is a central topic in riemannian geometry and geometric analysis .",
    "hence , there is a vast related literature covering , among many other aspects , the existence of positive green s functions  @xcite , upper and lower bounds , gradient estimates and asymptotics  @xcite , and the connection between green s functions and the heat kernel  @xcite .",
    "what is somewhat surprising is that the dynamical properties of the gradient field @xmath15 remain virtually unexplored , with the exception of the classical work of brelot and choquet  @xcite .",
    "of course , a key issue in the study of this vector field is the analysis of the critical set of the green s function .",
    "this question is of considerable interest by itself , and deeply related with other problems , set in significantly easier contexts , that date back to the 1950s ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . indeed , some of these articles were motivated in part by the fact that in euclidean space the green s function arises as the electric potential of a charged particle , so that its critical points correspond to equilibria and the trajectories of its gradient field are the force lines studied by faraday and maxwell in the xix century ( nontrivial contributions to this problem were made in the recent paper  @xcite ) . as a side remark ,",
    "let us point out that another elliptic pde ( very different from  ) in which the analysis of the critical points of its solutions has recently attracted considerable attention can be found in  @xcite .",
    "one reason why the study of the dynamical properties of the gradient field @xmath15 ( and in particular of the critical set of @xmath16 ) is hard to tackle , from the point of view of geometric analysis , is that the estimates for green s functions obtained through pde methods are not sufficiently fine to elucidate whether the gradient of @xmath16 vanishes in a certain region .",
    "moreover , the noncompactness of the underlying surface introduces complications related to the behavior of the green s function at infinity .    in this paper",
    "we will show how these difficulties can be overcome by exploiting the conformal properties of the surface and resorting to techniques of gradient dynamical systems .",
    "our approach will lead to a topological upper bound for the number of critical points of the green s function and a complete description of the local and global dynamics of the gradient field @xmath15 .    to some extent",
    ", the core of this paper is the remarkable heuristic principle we will now state , which links the dynamics of the gradient field @xmath15 , defined in terms of solutions to an elliptic pde , with the topology of the underlying surface .",
    "it must be stressed that this principle will be promoted to a rigorous statement ( after introducing the necessary tools and notation ) in corollary  [ c.cf ] and theorem  [ p.hf2 ] :    [ principle ] suppose that the surface @xmath1 is of finite type .",
    "then @xmath1 can be decomposed as the union of a disk  @xmath17 and a ( possibly disconnected ) noncompact graph @xmath18 , both of which are invariant under the local flow of the gradient field @xmath15 .",
    "the disk consists of the pole @xmath11 and the points of @xmath1 whose @xmath19-limit is @xmath11 . the graph @xmath18 consists of the critical points of @xmath16 , their stable components , and certain trajectories of @xmath15 that escape to infinity .",
    "when suitably compactified , @xmath18 is a connected graph that encodes the topology of the surface , the rank of the first homology group of @xmath18 being twice the genus of @xmath1 .",
    "the characterization of the set @xmath18 that will emerge from the rigorous version of this heuristic principle yields , as a nontrivial application , the following topological upper bound for the number of critical points of the green s function :    [ t : main ] suppose that the surface @xmath1 is of finite type , that is , its fundamental group has finite rank .",
    "then the number of critical points of any green s function @xmath16 on @xmath1 is not larger than twice the genus of @xmath1 , @xmath20 , plus the number of ends , @xmath21 , minus  @xmath0 : @xmath22 if this upper bound is attained then @xmath16 is a morse function .",
    "in fact , the analysis of the set @xmath18 does not only yield this topological upper bound , but a more refined bound that exploits the conformal structure of the surface ( see theorem  [ t.main2 ] ) .",
    "this is particularly interesting because , as we shall see , it establishes some links between the conformal geometry of the surface and the portrait of the gradient field @xmath15 .",
    "it should be stressed that an analogous result does not hold for higher - dimensional riemannian manifolds , as shown in  @xcite .    a different proof of the estimates for the number of critical points of @xmath16 , relying on methods from elliptic pdes ,",
    "was recently given by the authors in  @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamical approach taken in the present paper provides a very satisfactory picture of the invariant sets connecting the different critical points of @xmath16 and the dynamics of the field @xmath15 , which can not be obtained with the pde techniques used in  @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ s : litam ]",
    "we will present some basic facts regarding green s functions on surfaces , including their obtention through an exhaustion procedure , their behavior at infinity and their connection with the conformal structure of the surface . in section  [ s : local ] we describe the dynamics of the field @xmath15 in a neighborhood of the pole @xmath11 or a critical point . in section  [ s : basin ] we introduce a convenient compactification of the surface and establish some key properties of the sets @xmath17 and @xmath18 introduced in the heuristic principle above ( and of some compactifications thereof ) .",
    "the structure of the set @xmath18 and its compactification is characterized in section  [ s : bounds ] , which allows us to prove the upper bound for the number of critical points of the green s function . to conclude , in section  [ s : remarks ] we discuss the connection between the dynamics of the field @xmath15 and the conformal geometry of the underlying surface and make some comments regarding surfaces of infinite topological type .",
    "in this section we will recall what a green s function is and how to obtain them using an exhaustion procedure , placing a special emphasis on conditions ensuring that the green s function is `` well behaved '' at infinity , which is a key ingredient in the analysis of the dynamical properties of the vector field @xmath14 .",
    "we will also discuss how to exploit conformal isometries to classify the possible behavior of the green s function at the ends of the surface . throughout this paper",
    ", the surfaces will be of class @xmath2 and of finite topological type ( that is , with finitely generated fundamental group ) unless stated otherwise .",
    "the reason why it is crucial to make assumptions on the behavior of the green s function at infinity can be readily seen even in the simplest case : the euclidean plane @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , if we let @xmath24 be any harmonic function , it is clear that any function of the form @xmath25 is symmetric and satisfies the green s function equation  .",
    "the standard way of deciding which of these green s functions should be `` admissible '' is to demand that the green s function be obtained as a limit of dirichlet green s functions associated with an exhaustion of the plane by compact subsets ( more details on this point will be given below ) .",
    "the only green s function arising from such an exhaustion procedure would be the usual one , @xmath26 which is the relevant green s function for all geometric or analytical considerations .    in a general riemannian surface @xmath27",
    ", we will assume that the green s function @xmath16 we consider shares the following two properties with the above green s function   of the euclidean plane .",
    "the first assumption is a weak monotonicity property for the green s function on circles .",
    "the second assumption says that , when the surface admits a _ minimal ( positive ) green s function _ ( as is the case of the hyperbolic plane , although not of the euclidean one ) , we should always consider this green s function , for it plays a very special role in analysis and geometry .",
    "recall that a positive green s function is minimal when it is pointwise smaller than any other positive green s function .",
    "observe that , if the surface @xmath27 does not admit a minimal green s function , then the infimum of any green s function @xmath16 over the surface is @xmath28 .",
    "[ p1 ] the green s function @xmath16 is nondecreasing in the sense that @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the geodesic disk in @xmath1 centered at the pole @xmath11 of radius @xmath31 .",
    "[ p2 ] @xmath16 is the minimal green s function whenever the riemannian surface admits a positive green s function .",
    "it should be stressed that on any riemannian surface @xmath27 there are green s functions that satisfy these assumptions .",
    "indeed , the way one shows there always exist green s functions on any surface is by taking a suitable limit of the dirichlet green s functions of an exhaustion of the surface by bounded domains .",
    "since the green s functions one obtains in this fashion actually satisfy the above assumptions , _ throughout this paper we will assume that the green s function satisfies assumptions  [ p1 ] and  [ p2 ] .",
    "_ for the benefit of the reader , we will next review this construction of green s functions through an exhaustion by compact sets , which was introduced in the context of general riemannian manifolds by li and tam  @xcite . to simplify the exposition",
    ", we will consider the case of green s functions @xmath32 with a fixed pole @xmath11 , but actually the procedure automatically yields the symmetric function @xmath9 .",
    "consider an exhaustion @xmath33 of the surface @xmath1 by bounded domains .",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that the pole @xmath11 belongs to the first domain  @xmath34 .",
    "the idea now is to impose dirichlet boundary conditions on each bounded domain @xmath35 and consider the corresponding green s function @xmath36 , which satisfies the equation @xmath37 one would be tempted to define the green s function @xmath16 as the limit of @xmath38 as @xmath39 . however",
    ", this limit does not exist in general . what can be proved ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    "is that , for any choice of the domains @xmath35 , one can take a sequence of nonnegative real numbers @xmath40 such that @xmath41 converges uniformly on compact sets of @xmath13 to a green s function @xmath16 with pole @xmath11 .",
    "generally , the green s functions obtained through this procedure are non - unique , but they satisfy the monotonicity assumption   and , when the surface admits a positive green s function , this construction always yields the minimal one .    incidentally , it is worth pointing out that green s functions do not exist on closed surfaces , which is the reason why we just consider noncompact surfaces in this paper . to see why , it is enough to suppose that there is a solution of eq .   in a closed surface @xmath1 and , with a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "integrate both sides of the equation over the whole surface and integrate by parts , which would yield the contradiction @xmath42    let us now pass to describe how one can utilize conformal isometries to analyze the behavior of the green s function at each end .",
    "recall that two riemannian surfaces @xmath27 and @xmath43 are _ conformally isometric _ if there is a diffeomorphism @xmath44 and a smooth positive function @xmath45 on @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "an important property of the laplace equation on surfaces is its _ conformal invariance _",
    ", that is , if @xmath32 satisfies the equation @xmath48 on the surface  @xmath1 for some point @xmath11 , and another surface @xmath46 is conformally isometric to @xmath1 through a diffeomorphism @xmath44 , then @xmath49 is a green s function of @xmath46 with pole @xmath50 : @xmath51 furthermore , the corresponding gradient fields are orbitally conjugated through the relation @xmath52    a key result in the conformal geometry of surfaces , which will be of great use in this paper , is the uniformization theorem :    [ t.unif ] there is a compact surface @xmath53 of genus @xmath20 with a metric of constant curvature @xmath54 , a certain number @xmath55 of isolated points @xmath56 and another number @xmath57 of closed disks @xmath58 with smooth boundary such that the riemannian surface @xmath1 is conformally isometric to @xmath43 , with @xmath59    as is customary , we will call the deleted points @xmath60 the _ parabolic ends _ of the surface @xmath1 , while the deleted disks @xmath61 are its _ hyperbolic ends_. furthermore , we will say that the parabolic end @xmath62 is a _ removable singularity _ if the function @xmath63 can be extended so as to satisfy the equation @xmath64 in a neighborhood of @xmath62 in @xmath53 .",
    "it should be noticed that an end being parabolic or hyperbolic is a geometric property of the surface , related to its conformal structure . however , whether a parabolic end is removable or not is not a geometric issue , as it depends not only on the surface @xmath1 but also on the green s function we consider .    in the following two propositions we will relate the existence of parabolic and hyperbolic ends with the behavior of the function @xmath63 at each deleted point or disk :    [ p.parends ] if all the ends of the surface @xmath27 are parabolic",
    ", the surface does not admit any positive green s functions .",
    "moreover , at each end @xmath62 we have that either @xmath65 or @xmath62 is a removable singularity .",
    "there is at least one point @xmath62 where the condition   is satisfied .",
    "when the number of hyperbolic ends @xmath66 is @xmath67 , it follows from eq .   that the function @xmath63 satisfies the equation @xmath68 everywhere in @xmath53 but at the pole @xmath69 and the isolated points @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , by assumption  [ p1 ] , @xmath63 is upper bounded at each point @xmath62",
    ". if it is also lower bounded , it is standard that @xmath62 is a removable singularity  @xcite and @xmath68 in a neighborhood of @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 is not lower bounded , @xmath62 is an isolated singularity of @xmath63 , and the fact that @xmath63 is upper bounded readily implies that @xmath70 in a neighborhood of @xmath62 for some non - negative constant  @xmath71 .",
    "hence @xmath72 in the closed manifold @xmath53 , so integrating this equation over @xmath53 and using that @xmath73 we infer that @xmath74 . hence @xmath71 is positive for some @xmath75 and , in view of the asymptotic behavior of any green s function at a pole , it stems that @xmath63 tends to @xmath28 at the corresponding point @xmath62 .",
    "[ p.hypends ] if the surface @xmath27 has at least one hyperbolic end , there is a minimal positive green s function @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding function @xmath63 tends to zero at the boundary of each disk @xmath76 and all the parabolic ends @xmath62 are removable singularities .    when the number of hyperbolic ends is @xmath77 , it is standard ( for example , due to the existence of nonconstant positive harmonic functions in @xmath46  @xcite ) that the surface admits a positive green s function .",
    "therefore , assumption  [ p2 ] ensures that @xmath16 is the minimal green s function of the surface , which corresponds to the unique solution @xmath63 of the boundary problem @xmath78 in particular , if there are any parabolic ends , they are all removable singularities .",
    "because of these propositions , one can extend the function @xmath63 and the gradient field @xmath79 to all the removable singularities of the surface .",
    "we will find it occasionally convenient to consider this extension , which we will not distinguish notationally ( it will be clear from the context ) . to conclude this section , we will present two examples that illustrate the issue of uniqueness and non - uniqueness of green s functions on surfaces .",
    "consider the plane @xmath23 with its euclidean metric .",
    "it has a parabolic end , so that it is conformally isometric to the round sphere @xmath80 minus a point @xmath81 via a diffeomorphism @xmath82 .    the standard green s function with pole @xmath11",
    ", @xmath83 obviously satisfies assumption  [ p1 ] .",
    "moreover , it is the only green s function satisfying this assumption , even though the plane does not admit any positive green s functions . to see this ,",
    "take the function @xmath63 corresponding to any green s function satisfying assumption  [ p1 ] . since the assumption is satisfied , eq .   in the proof of proposition  [ p.parends",
    "] shows that @xmath63 must satisfy the equation @xmath84 in the whole @xmath85 .",
    "hence @xmath63 is uniquely determined , so that the green s function must be given by  .",
    "let us consider the flat cylinder @xmath86 and natural coordinates @xmath87 .",

    "in this section we will carry out a local study of the dynamics of the gradient of the green s function in a neighborhood of the pole or a critical point . since the fields @xmath15 and @xmath79 are orbitally conjugated ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) , for convenience we will work with the latter gradient field instead .    the first proposition",
    "we will prove here asserts that , when multiplied by a suitable factor , the gradient vector field @xmath79 can be smoothly linearized at the point @xmath69 , and that the corresponding normal form is a stable node .",
    "in particular , the trajectories approach the pole with a well - defined tangent .    [ l.pole ]",

    "let us take local isothermal coordinates @xmath103 centered at @xmath69 , in which the metric reads as @xmath104 for a positive function @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , eq .   can be written in these coordinates  as @xmath105 so @xmath63 must be of the form @xmath106 with @xmath107 and @xmath24 a harmonic function : @xmath108 the gradient of @xmath63 can then be expressed as @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "the origin is then a hyperbolic zero of the vector field @xmath111 ( which can be smoothly extended to the origin ) and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath112 .",
    "hence siegel s theorem ensures that @xmath111 can be linearized via a diffeomorphism that is an analytic function of the coordinates @xmath113 and the claim follows .",
    "in the following proposition we will characterize the structure of the trajectories of the field @xmath79 in a neighborhood of a critical point of @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , we see that the trajectories approaching the critical point have a well - defined tangent .",
