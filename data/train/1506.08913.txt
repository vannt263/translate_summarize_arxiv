    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological insulator ( ti ) realized in inverted hgte quantum wells exhibits unusual electric - transport properties  @xcite that have attracted great interest  @xcite .",
    "ti behavior is also found in other 2d  @xcite and bulk  @xcite materials .",
    "the potential for interesting interplays between a ti s electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom , e.g. , through hyperfine interaction with the material s nuclei  @xcite , or local exchange interaction with magnetic dopants  @xcite , has been pointed out recently  @xcite .",
    "these efforts have opened up new perspectives and extended previous work devoted to understanding spin effects  @xcite and magnetism  @xcite in ordinary semiconductors .",
    "our present theoretical study of the spin response in hgte quantum wells reveals unconventional spin - related properties that distinguish this paradigmatic ti material from all other currently known 2d electronic systems .",
    "we thus provide alternative means for the experimental identification of the topological regime and extend current knowledge about the fundamentals of spin - response behavior in solids .",
    "the spin susceptibility contains comprehensive information about the magnetic properties of a material . in the simplest case of a spin - rotationally invariant noninteracting electron gas ,",
    "the spin susceptibility is proportional to the charge - response ( lindhard ) function  @xcite .",
    "noticable deviations from that situation occur , e.g. , in systems with strong spin - orbit coupling such as 2d hole gases  @xcite . for metals or degenerately doped semiconductors , the spin response of only the partially filled band",
    "is typically considered .",
    "this approach misses intrinsic contributions to many - particle response functions arising from virtual interband transitions that become important in narrow - gap and , especially gapless , electron systems .",
    "examples for the latter are the 2d dirac - like electron states on the surface of a bulk ti whose magnetic properties have been discussed in refs .  .",
    "the hgte quantum wells considered here present an ideal testing ground for exploring the importance and properties of intrinsic , or virtual - carrier , effects , as it is possible to tune the band gap in such systems with a single structural parameter ( i.e. , the quantum - well width @xmath2 ) .",
    "furthermore , deviations from the conical 2d - dirac dispersion in the gapless case are well characterized within a continuum - model ( bhz ) description  @xcite that also gives controlled access to the full range of , and interesting transitions between , schrdinger - physics - dominated , chiral - dirac - fermion - like , and topologically nontrivial phases . in particular , definite ( i.e. , cut - off - independent ) results for the intrinsic response at long wavelengths are obtained even in the limit of vanishing band gap ; unlike in the case of the previously considered 2d - dirac models used to describe the surface states of bulk tis  @xcite .    before",
    "going into greater detail in the remainder of this article , we briefly highlight four major advances and central new insights gained from our work .",

    "while the intrinsic spin response is suppressed with increasing band gap in the normal regime ( @xmath9 ) , it becomes independent of gap size in the topological regime where @xmath10 .",
