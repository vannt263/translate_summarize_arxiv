    "a lot of cluster states are known to exist in light nuclei  @xcite as well as neutron rich nuclei  @xcite and hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "the typical cluster state is the hoyle state , the second @xmath31 state ( @xmath9 ) at @xmath32 mev in @xmath5c .",
    "this state is located just above the @xmath4 disintegrated threshold , and is characterized by the large monopole transition rate sharing about 16  % of the energy - weighted sum rule  @xcite . the microscopic and semi - microscopic cluster models in 1970",
    "s  @xcite demonstrated that the hoyle state has a loosely coupled @xmath4 cluster structure . in 2000",
    "s , however , it was found that the hoyle state has a remarkable aspect of the @xmath19-particle condensate structure , described as a dominant product state of @xmath19 particles , all occupying an identical @xmath33 orbit with @xmath34 probability  @xcite .",
    "this has aroused a great interest in nuclear cluster physics , and brought significant developments in experimental studies , in particular , for the excited states of the hoyle states .",
    "recent experimental efforts  @xcite eventually confirmed the second @xmath35 state ( @xmath36 ) of @xmath5c , which had been predicted at a few mev above the hoyle state by the microscopic cluster models in 1970 s .",
    "a new observation of the @xmath37 state at @xmath38 mev was reported in ref .",
    "in addition , two broad @xmath31 states , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , were observed  @xcite at @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev with the widths of 1.45 mev and 1.42 mev , respectively , the results of which are consistent with the theoretical predictions by the semi - microscopic cluster model , @xmath4 ocm ( orthogonality condition model ) , using the complex scaling method  @xcite .",
    "the underlying structure of these newly observed states has been also discussed by the rigid @xmath4 cluster picture  @xcite and the container picture  @xcite . according to the experimental and theoretical analyses  @xcite",
    ", the @xmath39 state has a prominent @xmath43be(@xmath31)+@xmath19 structure with a higher nodal behavior , while the @xmath40 state is characterized by a linear - chain - like structure having the dominant configuration of @xmath44+@xmath19 with a relative @xmath45-wave motion .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath19-particle condensate aspect in the hoyle state has triggered searching for hoyle - analog states in other light nuclei such as @xmath46o  @xcite , @xmath47b  @xcite , @xmath1c  @xcite , and @xmath48ni  @xcite etc .",
    "the definition of the hoyle - analog states is that the constituent clusters make nonlocalized motion occupying mainly the lowest orbit ( or some excited orbits ) of the cluster mean - field potential in nucleus . reflecting their gas - like properties , they seem to appear around the disintegrated threshold of the constituent clusters . the structure study of @xmath46o has recently made a significant progress  @xcite , following the study of the @xmath5c+@xmath19 cluster model in 1970 s  @xcite and 1980 s  @xcite .",
    "the six lowest @xmath31 states of @xmath46o ( including the ground state with a doubly closed shell structure ) up to @xmath49  mev around the @xmath50 threshold were for the first time reproduced well together with the monopole strengths and decay widths within the framework of the @xmath50 ocm  @xcite .",
    "the ocm is a semi - microscopic cluster model , which is an approximation of rgm ( resonating group method ) and is extensively described in ref .",
    "many successful applications of ocm to ordinary nuclei as well as hypernuclei are reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to the @xmath50 ocm calculation",
    ", the five lowest excited @xmath31 states were found to have cluster structures with the substantial monopole strengths comparable to the single particle monopole strength  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath51 state at @xmath52 mev just above the @xmath50 threshold was assigned as a strong candidate of the @xmath50 condensate  @xcite , @xmath53 , with the probability of @xmath54 .",
    "a novel structure of @xmath5c(hoyle)+@xmath19 has been discussed in the highly excited energy region around @xmath55 mev by the potential model  @xcite , the @xmath50 ocm  @xcite , and the @xmath5c(@xmath9)+@xmath19 model  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath56 state of @xmath47b just above the @xmath57 threshold was pointed out to have a hoyle analogue structure , @xmath58 , with the probability of @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "in addition , multi-@xmath19 gaslike states  @xcite have been experimentally explored in @xmath60ar , @xmath61ca and @xmath48ni  @xcite .",
    "an interesting viewpoint of clustering , a container picture , has quite recently been proposed to understand cluster dynamics not only for the gaslike cluster states but also for the cluster states which had been regarded as having localized cluster structures like the inversion doublet band in @xmath62ne  @xcite and linear - chain states  @xcite .",
    "isoscalar ( is ) monopole transition strengths are very useful to search for cluster states in the low - energy region  @xcite .",
    "the is monopole excitations to cluster states in light nuclei are in general strong as to be comparable with the single particle strength , and their experimental strengths share about 20% of the sum rule value in the case of @xmath63he , @xmath47b , @xmath5c , and @xmath46o etc .",
    "@xcite . as a typical case in light nuclei ,",
    "the is monopole strength function of @xmath46o  @xcite was discussed up to @xmath64 mev  @xcite .",
    "it was found that 1 ) two different types of monopole excitations exist in @xmath46o ; one is the monopole excitation to cluster states which is dominant in the lower energy part , and the other is the monopole excitation of the mean - field type such as one - particle one - hole ( @xmath65 ) which is attributed mainly to the higher energy part , and 2 ) this character of the monopole excitations originates from the fact that the ground state of @xmath46o with the dominant doubly closed shell structure has a duality of the mean - field - type as well as alpha - clustering character . according to the bayman - bohr theorem  @xcite , the dual nature of the ground state seems to be a common feature in light nuclei .",
    "the @xmath50 ocm calculation showed that the fine structures at the lower energy region up to @xmath49 mev observed in the experimental is monopole strength function  @xcite surely correspond to cluster states and are rather satisfactorily reproduced by its calculation  @xcite , although the fine structures are much difficult to be reproduced by the mean - field calculations such as rpa and qrpa  @xcite including the relativistic approach  @xcite together with beyond mean - field calculations  @xcite .",
    "these results were supported by a recent microscopic calculation with an extended @xmath5c+@xmath19 cluster model  @xcite based on the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) .",
    "the is monopole transition strengths are also useful to search for cluster states in neutron rich nuclei .",
    "quite recently the enhanced monopole strengths in @xmath5be , predicted by the generalized two - center model ( gtcm )  @xcite , have been observed in the breakup - reaction experiment using a @xmath5be beam  @xcite . according to their results",
    ", the enhanced monopole state observed corresponds to the @xmath66 state at @xmath67  mev with an @xmath19+@xmath68he cluster structure .",
    "thus the is monopole transition strengths indicate to be a good physical quantity to explore cluster states in light nuclei .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the structure of @xmath1c from the viewpoint of @xmath19 clustering , in particular , paying our attention to the @xmath12 states together with the @xmath13 ones up to around the @xmath2 threshold ( @xmath69 mev ) .",
    "there exist five @xmath18 states ( @xmath70 , 8.86 , 11.08 , 12.5  @xcite , and 14.39  mev ) and three @xmath71 states ( 3.09 , 11.00 , and 12.14 mev ) up to @xmath72 mev  @xcite , where several cluster disintegration thresholds are open : @xmath5c(g.s)+n ( @xmath73 mev ) , @xmath5c(hoyle)+@xmath25 ( @xmath74 ) , @xmath16be(g.s)+@xmath19 ( @xmath75 ) , @xmath68be+@xmath76he ( @xmath77 ) , and @xmath2 ( @xmath78 ) etc .",
    "the motivations why we focus on studying the structure of the @xmath0 states are threefold .",
    "the first motivation is originating from the results by the shell model calculations .",
    "the shell model calculation by millener et al .",
    "@xcite and the no - core shell model one by navrtil et al .",
    "@xcite reasonably reproduced the energy levels of the lowest three @xmath18 states and the lowest two @xmath18 states , respectively .",
    "however , the c0 transition matrix elements to the @xmath21 states measured by the @xmath79 experiments  @xcite , which are the same order as that of the hoyle state  @xcite , are much difficult to be reproduced within their shell - model framework  @xcite , where c0 denotes a longitudinal electric _ monopole _ transition . according to their results ,",
    "the difficulty with the transition to the @xmath80 @xmath81  mev state , in particular , is that the initial and final @xmath82-shell wave functions have different intrinsic spins , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and thus the calculated c0 form factor is much smaller than the observed , due to the characteristic of the c0 transition , i.e.  conserving the intrinsic spin . as for the @xmath85 @xmath86  mev state ,",
    "the calculated form factor is also much too small , although dominant intrinsic spin @xmath83 .",
    "in addition to the experimental c0 matrix elements , the is monopole transition rates of @xmath1c for the lowest three excited @xmath18 states have been reported with the inelastic @xmath19 scattering on the target of @xmath1c by kawabata et al .",
    "@xcite , and their experimental values are comparable to the single particle one  @xcite . in the light of the fact that the monopole strengths are one of the good physical quantities to explore cluster states in light nuclei as mentioned above , those experimental results suggest that the low - lying excited @xmath18 states have an aspect of @xmath19-clustering in @xmath1c .",
    "candidates for the molecular states with @xmath87  @xcite and linear - chain configurations of three @xmath19 clusters in @xmath1c  @xcite have been proposed in highly excited energy region above the @xmath2 threshold . however , the cluster structures of the low - lying states including the @xmath0 ones up to around the @xmath2 threshold have not been studied well , although some preliminary results have been reported  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to study the @xmath1c , focusing on the c0 transitions and is monopole transitions .",
    "the second motivation in the present study is related to the recent progress of the structure study of @xmath5c as mentioned above , which has disclosed richness in the structure of @xmath5c .",
    "thus it is very intriguing to study what kinds of structure changes happen in @xmath1c when an extra neutron is added into @xmath5c , which has the shell - model - like ( @xmath88 ) , @xmath4-gas - like ( @xmath9 ) , higher - nodal @xmath43be(@xmath31)+@xmath19 cluster ( @xmath39 ) , and linear - chain - like ( @xmath40 ) structures etc . on the other hand ,",
    "the third motivation is to explore the hoyle - analogue states in @xmath1c , the wave function of which is described by product states of constituent clusters such as @xmath89 etc .",
    "they might appear around the @xmath2 threshold .    in the present study ,",
    "we take a four - body @xmath2 ocm with the gaussian expansion method ( gem )  @xcite , the model space of which is large enough to cover the @xmath2 gas , the @xmath5c+@xmath25 cluster , @xmath16be+@xmath19 cluster , and @xmath68be+@xmath76he cluster configurations as well as the shell - model configurations .",
    "it should be reminded that the @xmath4 ocm calculation with the complex scaling method  @xcite succeeded in reproducing well the structure of the low - lying structure up to @xmath90  mev including the recently observed @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 states etc . combining ocm and gem provides a powerful method to study the structure of light nuclei  @xcite as well as light hypernuclei  @xcite , because of the following three points : 1 )  the pauli - blocking effect among the clusters",
    "is adequately taken into account by ocm , 2 )  the gem covers an approximately complete four - body model space  @xcite , and 3 )  the cluster disintegrated thresholds of the @xmath5c(@xmath88,@xmath94,@xmath95,@xmath9,@xmath96,@xmath97)+@xmath25 , @xmath16be(@xmath98,@xmath20)+@xmath19 , @xmath68be(@xmath31,@xmath35,@xmath37)+@xmath76he(@xmath18,@xmath17 ) , and @xmath4+n channels etc .",
    "are reasonably reproduced .",
    "the first point indicates that the ocm - gem framework can describe the shell - model - like compact structure , for example , in the ground state of @xmath1c . for the third point ,",
    "the reproduction of the cluster disintegrated thresholds is very important to discuss the cluster structures in @xmath1c from the viewpoint of the ikeda threshold rule  @xcite .",
    "the present framework can explicitly treat a strong parity dependence of the @xmath19-@xmath25 potential  @xcite , demonstrated by the @xmath19-@xmath25 scattering phase shifts  @xcite :  the negative - parity potential is attractive enough to make resonant states ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) of @xmath76he , where s the positive - parity potential is weakly repulsive .",
    "this strong parity dependence plays an important role in producing the cluster states of @xmath1c , as will be discussed later . with this @xmath2 ocm framework",

    "it is noted that the experimental values of @xmath328 and @xmath331 are strong as to be comparable to the single particle strengths .",
    "the reason why the @xmath173be+@xmath19 cluster states are populated by the isoscalar monopole transition and @xmath252 transition from the shell - model - like ground state has been discussed in detail .",
    "we found that this mechanism , which is common to those in @xmath46o , @xmath5c , @xmath47b , and @xmath5be etc .",
    ", originates from the dual nature of the ground state  @xcite :  the ground state in light nuclei have in general both the mean - field degree of freedom and cluster degree of freedom , the latter of which is activated by the monopole operator and then cluster states are excited from the ground state .",
    "present results indicate that the @xmath19 cluster picture is inevitable to understand the low - lying structure of @xmath1c , and the c0 transitions together with the isoscalar monopole transitions are also useful to explore cluster states in light nuclei .    from the analyses of the spectroscopic factors and overlap amplitudes of the @xmath16be+@xmath19 and @xmath5c+@xmath25 channels in the @xmath18 states , dominant @xmath5c(hoyle)+@xmath25 states",
    "do not appear in the @xmath18 states in the present study .",
    "this is mainly due to the effect of the enhanced @xmath173be+@xmath19 correlation induced by the attractive odd - wave @xmath19-@xmath25 force :  when an extra neutron is added into the hoyle state , the attractive odd - wave @xmath19-@xmath25 force reduces the size of the hoyle state with the @xmath4 gas - like structure and then @xmath173be+@xmath19 correlation is significantly enhanced in the @xmath4+@xmath25 system . consequently the @xmath173be(@xmath17)+@xmath19 and @xmath173be(@xmath18)+@xmath19 states come out as the excited states , @xmath324 and @xmath85 , respectively . on the other hand , higher nodal states of the @xmath297 states ,",
    "in which the @xmath173be-@xmath19 relative wave function has one node higher than that of the @xmath297 states , emerge as the @xmath326 and @xmath335 states , respectively , in the present study .",
    "it is reminded that the @xmath39 state of @xmath5c has @xmath43be+@xmath19 structure with higher nodal behavior .",
    "thus , the @xmath173be+@xmath19 cluster states with higher nodal behavior , @xmath336 , are regarded as the counterpart of the @xmath39 state in @xmath5c .    as for the @xmath71 states , the @xmath243 state appears as a bound state by @xmath24  mev below the @xmath5c(@xmath88)+@xmath25 threshold",
    "this state dominantly has a loosely bound neutron structure , in which the extra neutron moves around the @xmath5c(@xmath88 ) core with @xmath23 orbit .",
    "the calculated radius of the @xmath243 state ( @xmath284  fm ) , slightly lager than that of the ground state ( @xmath337  fm ) , is consistent with the experimental suggestion  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the @xmath56 and @xmath290 states have mainly the @xmath173be(@xmath17)+@xmath19 and @xmath173be(@xmath71)+@xmath19 structures , respectively , and their radii are around @xmath338  fm .",
    "these two states are characterized by the strong isoscalar monopole excitations from the @xmath243 state .",
    "we have discussed in detail the mechanism of why the two cluster states are excited by the monopole transitions from the @xmath243 state . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the @xmath299 and @xmath28 states have dominantly the @xmath173be(@xmath17)+@xmath19 structure with higher nodal behavior and @xmath4+@xmath25 gas - like structure , respectively , although experimentally the two states have not been identified so far .",
    "the @xmath28 state with a larger radius ( @xmath339  fm ) is described by the product states of constituent clusters , having a configuration of @xmath316 , with the probability of @xmath340 .",
    "thus , the @xmath28 state can be regarded as an @xmath19-condensate - like state .",
