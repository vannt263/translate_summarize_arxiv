    "understanding and controlling mechanical stability is important to fields ranging from structural engineering to granular materials and glasses .",
    "we do not want buildings or bridges to fail , and we want to be able to manage the elastic response of materials of everyday life .",
    "this review focusses on the elastic and dynamical properties of periodic ball - and - spring networks that are at or near mechanical collapse .",
    "this may seem like a fairly narrow subject , but it is one of considerable richness and impact .    in a remarkable 1864 paper @xcite ,",
    "james clerk maxwell undertook the first systematic study of the mechanical stability of frames consisting of points , which we will refer to as _ sites _ , with connections , which we will usually refer to as _ bonds _ , between them as a model for such real - world structures as the warren truss ( patented in 1848 ) shown in figure [ fig : warrentruss ] .",
    "he defined a  stiff \" frame as one in which ",
    "the distance between two points can not be altered without changing the length of one or more connections \" .",
    "he showed that a stiff frame containing @xmath5 sites in @xmath2 dimensions requires @xmath10 connections , where @xmath11 is the number of rigid translations and rotations under free boundary conditions . under periodic boundary conditions , which maxwell did not consider , @xmath12 .",
    "this relation , often referred to as _",
    "maxwell s rule _ , can be reexpressed as a critical coordination number ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 if @xmath15 , the system is not stiff , and if @xmath16 , it is .",
    "as we shall discuss in more detail in the next section , maxwell s rule for the stability of frames requires modification @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it provides a useful and universally used benchmark for the analysis of the stability of frames .",
    "we will refer to free frames , i.e. , ones under free boundary conditions , satisfying maxwell s rule as _",
    "maxwell frames_. it is fairly common practice to use the term _ isostatic _ for frames satisfying maxwell s rule .",
    "though isostatic frames do satisfy maxwell s rule , they have more restrictive properties , which we will discuss in section [ sec : max - index ] .",
    "our principal interest here is in frames whose sites can be collected into identical contiguous unit cells whose origins lie on a bravais lattice and which fill some region of space .",
    "we will refer to these frames as _ lattices _ and if they are subjected to periodic ( free ) boundary conditions as periodic ( free ) lattices .",
    "any frame , even those that are not lattices , e.g. , whose sites are randomly distributed , can also be subjected to periodic ( free ) boundary conditions in which case we will refer to them as periodic ( free ) frames . for reasons that we will justify more fully later , we will use the term _ periodic maxwell frame ( lattice ) _ for periodic frames ( lattices ) with average coordination number @xmath17 rather than @xmath18 .",
    "free frames can be liberated from periodic ones by cutting of order @xmath19 bonds .",
    "maxwell s analysis applies to frames with an arbitrary number of sites and bonds .",
    "in addition to being a workhorse of the structural engineering community @xcite , it has seen extensive use ( though not always with attribution to maxwell ) in physics , materials science , and mathematics .",
    "it is a critical component of the theory of structural glasses @xcite , rigidity percolation @xcite , framework silicates like @xmath20-cristobalite @xcite , jamming of packed spheres @xcite , biopolymer networks @xcite , and of some theories of protein folding @xcite .",
    "rigidity percolation and jamming generally involve central forces only , and the maxwell relation and its generalization can be applied to these problems directly .",
    "structural glasses and biopolymer networks have bending forces that require a modification of the maxwell rules , and we will not make much contact with them in what follows .     sites and @xmath21 connections , so that @xmath22 . the lower left site ( indicated by the small triangle )",
    "is fixed with respect to the earth , and the lower right site is constrained to move only horizontally along a track with wheels .",
    "these constraints reduce the number of free degrees of freedom of the sites by @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "( b ) a reduced version of the isostatic warren truss indicating conventions for labeling sites and bonds .",

    "the coordination number is at or near the maxwell critical value of @xmath3 .",
    "the rigidity percolation transition is generally continuous @xcite in two - dimensions , and it is well - described by the language of critical phenomena , applied so successfully to percolation in random resistor networks @xcite . both shear and bulk elastic moduli increase from zero as a power law in @xmath25 , and",
    "there is a divergent length scale associated with the probability that two sites are in the same rigid cluster as a function of their separation . in three dimensions ,",
    "the rigidity transition is apparently first order @xcite .",
    "jammed systems exhibit different behavior .",
    "they are constructed by increasing the density of spheres in a fixed volume until they first resist a further increase . at this point , they are jammed , and their bulk modulus @xmath26 ( which resists compression ) is nonzero @xcite , but their shear modulus @xmath27 is of order @xmath28 @xcite . at large @xmath5 , @xmath27 increases linearly in @xmath29 @xcite . the density of states of systems with @xmath30 exhibits a crossover from debye - like behavior ( @xmath31 in @xmath2 dimensions as a function of frequency @xmath32 ) at low frequency to a flat - plateau beyond a characteristic frequency @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "there are two diverging length scales , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which can be extracted @xcite by , respectively , comparing @xmath36 to the longitudinal and transverse sound frequencies @xmath37 and @xmath38 at wavenumber @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities .",
    "other interpretations of these lengths invoke finite - size effects in the modes of a finite sample cut from a larger one @xcite for @xmath42 and stability of the system to boundary perturbations @xcite , crossover between strong and weak scattering at @xmath36 @xcite , or correlations in systems with @xmath43 @xcite for @xmath44 .",

    "( b ) a representative bond - diluted lattice near the rigidity percolation threshold of @xmath45 . ]",
    "though the transition to elastic stability in both rigidity percolation and jamming occurs at or near the maxwell critical point @xmath9 , properties at and above the two transitions are quite different .",
    "presumably , the difference is a reflection of the different geometrical arrangements of the maxwell lattices at or near the two transitions .",
    "an interesting question then is what precisely are the differences .",
    "can they be quantified , and if so how ?",
    "these questions then raise a broader question of whether there are wider classes of maxwell frames that lead to elastic and vibrational structure different from those of the percolation and jamming lattices . as a first step toward answering that question , it is useful to study periodic maxwell lattices , like the square and kagome lattices shown in figure [ fig : square - kagome ] with nn bonds and @xmath46 , and the reduced coordination lattices they spawn when bonds are cut to create free surfaces .",
    "they can easily be moved away from the maxwell limit toward greater rigidity by uniformly @xcite or randomly @xcite adding further neighbor bonds , and they have an advantage that they lend themselves to exact calculations of elastic response both in the uniform and random systems ( via effective medium theory ) .",
    "in addition , in spite of their simplicity , they present a surprisingly rich phenomenology that inform us generally about maxwell frames .",
    "much of the language @xcite for probing the mechanical properties of frames used in this review was developed by members of the structural mechanics group at the university of cambridge , which provided an elegant generalization of maxwell s relation based on general principles of linear algebra and used it to deepen our understanding of the more subtle properties of frames .",
    "though well - known in the engineering community , it is less so in the physics and materials science communities .",
    "this review will , therefore , begin in section [ sec : max - index ] with a fairly comprehensive review of this work .",
    "it is followed by five more sections and four appendices .",
    "section [ sec : elas - lim ] deals the long - wavelength elastic limit and how it can be calculated using the developments in references @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : periodic - lattices ] tailors the formalism of the preceding sections specifically to periodic lattices .",
    "section [ sec : examples ] looks in detail at the properties of the three simple lattices in figure [ fig : square - kagome ] , and section [ sec : topological ] explores lattices with topologically protected states at interfaces , which are closely related to topologically protected electronic states in the quantum hall effect @xcite , polyacetylene @xcite and topological insulators @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : review ] presents some final thoughts and speculates about future directions .",
    "the four appendices provide mathematical detail and display derivations of various important relations .",
    "section [ sec : examples ] contains several subsections .",
    "section [ ssec : square - lattice ] with its simple analytical treatment of the square lattice sets the stage for the study in section [ ssec : kagome ] of the simple kagome lattice .",
    "both lattices have lines of zero modes in their brillouin zones arising from their having straight sample - traversing filaments of colinear bonds . section [ ssec : twisted - kagome ]",
    "then explores how the simple geometrical operation of  twisting \" neighboring triangles in the standard kagome lattice [ figure [ fig : square - kagome](c ) ] to convert it to the twisted lattice [ figure [ fig : square - kagome](d ) ] gaps the phonon spectrum of the simple kagome lattice at all wavenumbers except at the origin and leads to zero - frequency rayleigh surface modes @xcite not present in either the square or standard kagome lattices .",
    "this review is intended to be as much a pedagogical introduction to periodic maxwell lattices as an overview of the subject . except in section [ sec : topological ] , which requires the use of some fairly subtle concepts detailed in reference @xcite , it provides sufficient calculational detail that even someone totally new to the subject should be able to follow it .",
    "though , as the introductory paragraphs have indicated , this review was inspired in part by jamming and rigidity percolation , it is not about these subjects , and they will be considered only when they have direct overlap with the ideas being presented .",
    "each site in @xmath2-dimensions has @xmath2 independent translational degrees of freedom , and in the absence of constraints on point motion , a collection of @xmath5 points without connections has @xmath47 zero - frequency displacement modes , which we will refer to as _",
    "zero modes_. in the presence of constraints , @xmath48 will be less that @xmath49 .",
    "each connection reduces the number of zero modes by one .",
    "thus if there are @xmath6 connections and no constraints , there are @xmath50 zero modes . of these , @xmath51 are the trivial ones associated with rigid translations and rotations .",
    "any other zero modes involve internal displacements of the sites and are generally called _ mechanisms _ @xcite in the engineering literature and _ floppy modes _ in the physics literature @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : simplecount ] ) reexpressed in terms of the number of mechanisms @xmath52 is @xmath53 we will refer to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : simplecount ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwell - mech ] ) as the _ maxwell count_. a frame is stiff if it has no mechanisms .",
    "setting @xmath54 yields the maxwell rule [ eqs .",

    "figure [ fig : selftstress1](a ) depicts a simple frame that obeys maxwell s count .",
    "it consists @xmath55 sites and @xmath56 bonds , and it has @xmath57 zero modes and @xmath58 mechanisms .     sites , @xmath59 bonds , @xmath60 zero modes , and two mechanisms indicated by the dotted bonds .",

    "( c ) and ( d ) are constructed from ( b ) by adding an additional diagonal bond .",
    "( c ) satisfies the maxwell rule with only the three trivial zero modes .",
    "( d ) has @xmath63 zero modes and one state of self stress indicated by the arrows on the bonds in the left square . ]",
    "the simple maxwell rule does not apply to all frames @xcite .",
    "consider the two - square frame with @xmath55 sites and @xmath64 bonds shown in figure [ fig : selftstress1](b ) .",
    "it has one mechanism as expected from the maxwell count .",
    "if an extra bond is added , maxwell s rule would say that the frame is stiff with no mechanisms .",
    "the extra bond , however , can be placed as a diagonal in the right square [ figure [ fig : selftstress1](c ) ] or as an extra diagonal in the left square [ figure [ fig : selftstress1](d ) ] . in the first case , there are no mechanisms , and maxwell s rule applies . in the second case , however , the mechanism present before the extra bond was added remains , and the maxwell count is violated .",
    "but the left square with crossed diagonal bonds has an extra _ redundant _ bond not needed for its rigidity .",
    "it also has a new and interesting property : the outer bonds of the square can be placed under tension ( compression ) and the inner diagonal bonds under compression ( tension ) such that the net force on all sites is zero .",
    "this is a _ state of self stress _ ,",
    "which , because of its repeated use in this review , we will usually abbreviate as sss .",
    "this theme can clearly be repeated with each added bond either decreasing the number of zero modes or increasing the number of states of self stress to yield the modified maxwell count @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath8 is the number of ssss .",
    "this is an _ index theorem _",
    "@xcite , which we will derive in section [ ssec : equil - comp ] , relating mode and self - stress count to geometric properties of the lattice",
    ". we will refer to it simply as the index theorem .",
    "two types of mechanisms can be distinguished :  finite \" ones in which finite - amplitude displacements of sites stretch no bonds and  infinitesimal \" ones in which bond lengths do not change to first order in the magnitude of displacements but do so to second ( or higher ) order .",
    "the index theorem @xcite , as we shall show below , follows from the assumption of a linear relation between site displacements and bond lengths , and it applies only to infinitesimal displacements , i.e. , it counts both finite and infinitesimal mechanisms but does not identify which is which .",
    "figures [ fig : selftstress2](a)-(b ) show how a finite mechanism can be converted into two infinitesimal mechanisms and one sss .",
    "a configuration of self - stress that is particularly important for the current study is any straight line of bonds under periodic boundary conditions , which we will refer to as straight _ filaments _ , as shown in figures [ fig : selftstress2](c)-(d ) . changing the straight filament to a zigzagged one",
    "removes this state of self stress . on the other hand",
    "the  zigzaging \" periodic ladder configuration shown in figure [ fig : selftstress2](e ) has one sss , rather than the two that a straight ladder would have .",

    "now there is a sss in which bond @xmath70 is under compression ( tension ) and the other three are under tension ( compression ) .",
    "both sites @xmath72 and @xmath73 can undergo infinitesimal displacements without changing the length of any bonds , and there are two infinitesimal mechanisms .",
    "( c ) a line of parallel bonds forming a sample - traversing filament under periodic boundary conditions as depicted in ( d ) .",
    "the forces on all sites are zero if all of the bonds are under equal tension or compression , and there is one sss .",
    "( e ) a zigzag ladder under periodic boundary conditions with one sss . ]    a system in which there are neither any mechanisms ( @xmath54 ) nor any states of self - stress ( @xmath74 ) is _ isostatic _ .",
    "a finite isostatic system necessarily satisfies the maxwell relation @xmath75 , but a system with @xmath75 can have any number of mechanisms provided it is equal to the number of ssss .",
    "the distinction between satisfying the maxwell rule and being isostatic is often lost in the literature , and it is common practice to refer to any system that satisfies maxwell s rule as isostatic . in this review , we will keep the distinction , referring to any free frame satisfying maxwell s rule as a maxwell frame , reserving the term isostatic for those free maxwell frames satisfying @xmath76 . as we shall see in section",
    "[ ssec : iso - per ] , the extension of this definition to periodic frames presents some problems @xcite .",
    "since the term isostatic has become so prevalent , we propose in that section a definition of this term that is in the spirit of the definition for free frames and consistent with common usage for periodic frames .      in the absence of external forces , the equilibrium force at each site in a frame is determined by the tensions in the bonds it shares with other sites .",
    "this is true whether or not the site is in mechanical equilibrium ; if the force at a site is nonzero , the mass at that site will accelerate according to newton s laws . if forces at sites arising from bond tensions are nonzero , they can be balanced by external loads to create an equilibrium situation in which the total force on each site is zero . clearly , in mechanical equilibrium , the external loads are the negative of the forces at each site arising from bond tensions .    for central forces ,",
    "the tension in a bond is parallel to the bond . thus its direction is specified by bond orientation , but its magnitude and sign can vary .",
    "let @xmath77 be a vector in the @xmath49-dimensional space , @xmath78 , of the @xmath2 components of force at each site on the lattice exerted by tensions in the bonds that terminate on it , and let @xmath79 be a vector in the @xmath6-dimensional space , @xmath80 , of the of the bond tensions , which are scalars of either sign .",
    "external loads at sites are represented by the @xmath49-dimensional vector @xmath81 . in equilibrium when sites do not accelerate ( or move if there is external friction ) , @xmath82 .",
    "since the relation between forces and tensions is linear , there is a @xmath83 dimensional matrix @xmath84 ( with @xmath49 rows and @xmath6 columns ) , called the _ equilibrium _",
    "matrix , that maps @xmath85 to @xmath86 : @xmath87 where the final relation only applies in static situations .    the null space or kernel of @xmath84",
    ", @xmath88 of dimension @xmath89 , is the set of all vectors mapped to the zero vector .",
    "any vector in the null space of @xmath84 represents a state of self stress because it corresponds to tensions on a set of bonds for which the forces on all sites are zero .",
    "thus @xmath89 is equal to the number of ssss @xmath8 .",
    "vectors @xmath79 not mapped into the null space of @xmath84 are in the _ orthogonal complement _ , @xmath90 , of @xmath88 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath90 is equal",
    "the to the rank of @xmath84 . the rank - nullity theorem of linear algebra @xcite relates the rank and nullity of a matrix to its column dimension : @xmath91 elongation of bonds are determined by the displacements of the sites to which they are attached .",
    "the elongations of individual bonds are necessarily parallel to bond vectors for central forces .",
    "let @xmath92 be a vector in the @xmath49-dimensional space , @xmath93 , of site displacements and @xmath94 be a vector in the @xmath6-dimensional space , @xmath95 , of bond elongations .",
    "the @xmath96-dimensional compatibility matrix @xmath97 maps @xmath98 to @xmath95 : @xmath99 the null space of @xmath97 is the set of displacements @xmath92 that do not change the length of bonds , i.e. , the set of zero modes of the system ; thus , @xmath100 .",
    "the rank - nullity theorem applied to @xmath97 yields @xmath101    the equilibrium and compatibility matrices are not independent : they are matrix transposes of each other . to see this , we can calculate the work done under infinitesimal distortions of the system in the presence of sites forces ( and thus necessarily tensions in the bonds ) in two ways : first the work @xmath102 done by external loads in displacing sites and second the work @xmath103 done by bond tensions in stretching bonds .",
    "the two calculations must yield the same result : @xmath104 where the superscript @xmath105 refers to the transpose of a matrix . since this relation is valid for all @xmath92 ( even @xmath92 in the null space of @xmath97 ) it must be that @xmath106 .",
    "the rank of a matrix is equal to the rank of its transpose , @xmath107 , and subtracting ( [ eq : rank - nullityq ] ) from ( [ eq : rank - nullityc ] ) yields the index theorem of ( [ eq : index1 ] ) .",

    ", it is the boundaries of the periodic cell that satisfy ( [ eq : deformation1 ] ) .    if the positions of all sites , rather than just boundary sites , displace according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : deformation1 ] ) , the elastic distortion is _",
    "affine_. under such distortions , the relative displacement of the sites associated with bond @xmath20 is @xmath196 and the affine stretch of bond @xmath20 is @xmath197 where we used the fact that @xmath198 is symmetric in @xmath199 and @xmath200 to convert @xmath201 to @xmath202 in the linearized limit .",
    "the affine elastic energy density is then @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the volume and @xmath205 is the vector of affine elongations @xmath206 .",
    "affine response throughout a sample is the exception rather than the rule .",
    "it is guaranteed to occur in absolutely homogeneous systems and in lattices with one site per unit cell , but it can occur in certain other systems with special relations among elastic constants or special arrangements of sites in periodic systems with multi - site unit cells ( for example , as we shall see , in the kagome lattice ) .",
    "generally , however , the forces at at least some sites under an affine strain imposed by macroscopic stain at the boundary are nonzero , and these sites will relax to positions of zero force ( or equivalently until the energy reaches its minimum value ) , in which cases their displacements are nonaffine . in [ app : elas - sss ] , we show that the result of this relaxation is that the elastic energy density becomes @xcite @xmath207^{-1 } { \\mathsf{e}}_{\\text{aff},s } \\xrightarrow{{\\mathsf{k } } \\rightarrow k\\,{\\mathsf{i } } } \\frac{k}{2v } \\sum_{\\alpha } ( { \\mathsf{e}}_{\\text{aff}}\\cdot \\hat{{\\mathsf{t}}}_\\alpha)^2 \\label{eq : elastic - self - stress}\\ ] ] where @xmath208 and @xmath209 are the projections of @xmath205 and @xmath210 onto @xmath88 , and @xmath211 is the @xmath212th orthonormal basis vector of @xmath88 .",
    "thus , only the projections of the affine displacement vectors onto states of self - stress contribute to the elastic energy .",
    "equation ( [ eq : elastic - self - stress ] ) encodes a great deal of information .    *",
    "first , it shows that lattices can not be elastically stable unless they have ssss in the presence of conditions that constrain the macroscopic strain - a simple reflection of the fact that forces on each site must be zero once equilibrium is reached in the presence of imposed strains , which necessarily induce bond tension . *",
    "second , only those states of self - stress with a nonzero overlap with the affine bond elongations contribute to the elastic energy .",
    "these states necessarily traverse the sample , and they are _ load - bearing_. the straight filament of figure [ fig : selftstress2](c ) ( wound to a circle - figure [ fig : selftstress2](d ) ) , whose bonds all have the same sign of tension provides an example of a load - bearing state , whereas the zigzag state of figure [ fig : selftstress2](e ) and the localized crossed square of figure [ fig : selftstress1](d ) does not .",
    "* third , because it is a sum of squares of linear combinations of strain , it shows that there must be at least @xmath213 load - bearing ssss to produce an elastically stable system with an elastic matrix with @xmath186 positive eigenvalues .      in section [ ssec - max - sss ] ,",
    "isostatic lattices were defined as ones that are both kinematically ( @xmath214 ) and statically determinate ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this definition is unambiguous for finite free frames .",
    "it would seem natural to define an isostatic frame under pbcs in the same way , but there is a problem with this definition @xcite . under pbcs , the shape and size of the frame boundary is fixed ; the compatibility matrix ( and by extension , the equilibrium matrix ) applies to displacements and does not apply to changes in the shape or size of the periodic boundary @xcite , which are described by macroscopic strain . in order for a lattice to be elastically stable , it must have at least @xmath215 ssss .",
    "reference @xcite defines a lattice under pbcs to be statically determinate if @xmath216 and kinematically determinate if @xmath217 , but it does not propose applying the terms _ isostatic _ to such systems .",
    "we propose calling a frame under pbcs isostatic if @xmath218 and @xmath8 lies between @xmath71 and @xmath215 .",
    "this corresponds more or less to common usage in the jamming literature .",
    "if greater precision is required , the value of @xmath8 can be specified via the term @xmath8-isostatic .",
    "the above discussion applies to any frame , whether it is a lattice with unit cells on a bravais lattice or not , and in particular to finite - frame approximations to infinite random systems such as those encountered studies of jamming .",
    "these frames can be subjected to pbcs by wrapping them on a torus to create a single cell in which sites separated by repeat distances of the torus are identified .",
    "we will refer to these as toroidal pbcs . since there is only one cell with randomly placed sites ,",
    "there is no wavenumber @xmath219 to index the @xmath49 vibrational states .",
    "alternatively , the single ( large ) cell can be periodically repeated in a bravais lattice , in which case there are @xmath49 vibrational bands with wave - number - dependent frequencies .",
    "the @xmath220 limit of these bands are the vibrational states under the toroidal pbcs and are generally the ones of physical interest , though interesting information about the stability of jammed structures can be obtained from an examination of spectrum at @xmath221 @xcite .",
    "lattices under periodic boundary conditions are special .",
    "they consist of @xmath222 periodically repeated unit cells with @xmath223 sites and @xmath224 bonds , and the index theorem reads @xmath225 . in a periodic maxwell lattice , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 .",
    "thus if @xmath7 has its minimum value of @xmath2 , @xmath228 , and under the definition proposed above , such a lattice would be isostatic .",
    "it is impossible to have @xmath229 and for @xmath8 to have any other value than @xmath2 in the interval between @xmath71 and @xmath215 because a change in @xmath8 requires a change in @xmath223 or @xmath224 and thus of @xmath230 , which would lead to a change in @xmath231 of order @xmath232 rather than of order one .",
    "thus we can uniquely define an _",
    "isostatic periodic lattice under _ pbcs to be one with @xmath233 .",
    "finite frames can be constructed from ones subjected to pbcs by cutting bonds along the periodic boundaries and  liberating \" the sites attached to them . since opposite sides of the boundary",
    "are equivalent , it is only necessary to cut bonds along half of the boundary to liberate a full free lattice .",
    "thus , an @xmath234 free square lattice is obtained by cutting @xmath235 bonds in the lattice under pbcs .",
    "the cutting process thus reduces the number of bonds by of order @xmath19 in a lattice of @xmath5 sites in @xmath2 dimensions and increases @xmath231 by the same amount .",
    "if the periodic lattice is isostatic , then there are necessarily of order @xmath19 extra zero modes in the finite lattice .",
    "if on the other hand , the lattice under pbcs has of order @xmath19 ssss that are removed on cutting , there may be no increase in zero modes at all upon cutting .",
