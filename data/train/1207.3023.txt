    "accurate determination of the faint end slope of the luminosity function in groups of galaxies is very important to resolve the discrepancy between the number of dwarf galaxies observed and that predicted by dark matter simulations of hierarchical structure formation @xcite , especially in low - density environments @xcite . an excellent candidate low - density environment group for carrying out a deep census of dwarfs is the m81 group of galaxies , for which it is possible to detect galaxies as faint as m@xmath3 , and for which accurate trgb distances can be determined for individual galaxies . @xcite present a census of the dwarfs in this group , determined from a large area survey using the megacam instrument on the cfht .",
    "a total of 22 candidate dwarf galaxies were found in this survey .",
    "here we present follow up hi observations of some of these newly discovered dwarf galaxies .",
    "the observations were done at the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and targeted a sub - sample of galaxies that showed evidence for active star formation , and as such was expected to have a significant hi content . at the redshift of the m81 group , hi",
    "emission from group members is expected to overlap in velocity with emission from hi in our galaxy .",
    "an interferometric survey is hence the only reliable method for robustly detecting gas associated with the dwarfs in this group .",
    "deeper follow - up observations were obtained using the gmrt and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) for the galaxies in which hi was detected .",
    "the target galaxies were selected based on the original megacam cfht survey data .",
    "however , subsequently fuv data from the galex satellite as well as @xmath2  data from the russian 6 m bta telescope also became available .",
    "we present and analyse this data in conjunction with the hi data from the gmrt and the wsrt .",
    "the galaxies for which we do have gmrt detections have hi masses @xmath0 @xmath1 , and star formation rates @xmath4  @xmath1/yr .",
    "they represent some of the smallest mass star forming galaxies known .",
    "feedback into the ism from star formation is expected to be most pronounced for small galaxies , and we use our data to explore this issue too .",
    "below , in sec .",
    "[ sec : obsr ] we present the sample , briefly describe the observations and results .",
    "the results are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , and the summary and conclusions presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]                  the newly - discovered dwarf galaxies in the m81 group @xcite chosen for follow - up hi observations were the brightest ones , and were thought to be star forming galaxies as complexes of young blue stars seemed to be present in all of them on initial visual inspection .",
    "subsequent hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations revealed that d1009 + 70 is a background galaxy not in group ( possible companion to ugc 5423 at a distance of 8.7 mpc ) and hence its hi emission may be too faint to be detected .",
    "of the other five galaxies with no detected hi emission , follow - up photometry using hst data has revealed that d0944 + 71 ( initially could not unambiguously be classified as either di or dsph ) , d1014 + 68 ( initially thought to be transition type dwarf ) and d1041 + 70 ( initially classified as di as mentioned in table  [ tab : samp ] ) are all dsph galaxies .",
    "even if the above galaxies have young stellar complexes , these are presumably small ( as can be said from their faintness ) and are being fed by hi reservoirs with masses below the detection limit of the present observation .",
    "follow - up hst photometry also shows that d0926 + 70 is indeed a di galaxy , though with very little star formation which explains the non - detection of hi using similar reasoning as stated above for the dsph galaxies .",
    "for all the non - detections , there is the possibility that they have systemic velocities outside the velocity range searched .",
    "but this is an unlikely possibility considering the fact that trgb distance measurements constrain them to be in the m81 group , and the measured velocities of other m81 group members @xcite are in the range of velocities searched .      in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr_gas ] , the @xmath2  and fuv emission are shown with respect to the corresponding high resolution hi maps for the three bcds .",
    "the moment 0 maps shown for all the galaxies were constructed using the previously explained method after applying a flux threshold of 2 times the noise in the line free channels for d0958 + 66 and d1028 + 70 , and 1.5 times the noise in the line free channels for d1012 + 64 ( for which old gmrt data was used to make the high resolution map as wsrt can not map at this resolution ) . also shown are the rgb images of the three galaxies constructed from hst data .",
    "a few things are apparent from the figures : ( i ) although the star forming disc is at the central peak of the hi profile when the hi is imaged at a low resolution ( figure  [ fig : uv5ov ] ) , the peaks of fuv and @xmath2  emission do nt concur with the peaks of the hi emission when hi is images at high resolution .",
    "( ii ) there are offsets between the peaks of the @xmath2  emission and that of the fuv emission , these are most pronounced in d0958 + 66 and d1028 + 70 .",
    "( iii ) the stellar disc as appears in the rgb images is better traced by the fuv emission .    before examining the differences between the @xmath2  and the fuv emission it is useful to take a look at the total integrated fluxes from the entire galaxy ( table  [ tab : der ] ) .",
    "as can be seen the total @xmath2  fluxes are very low  in fact they are consistent with that expected from a _ single _ o star .",
    "the ionized flux of o stars is critically dependent on the metallicity .",
    "since we do not have abundance quality optical spectra to determine the metallicity , the metallicity of our galaxies can be estimated from the l - z relation .",
    "the absolute blue magnitudes of our bcds are @xmath6 mag . from the l - z relation for bcds",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the expected metallicity is 12+log(o / h ) = 7.30 , i.e. about 0.05 times the solar metallicity . from the 0.05 solar metallicity model atmospheres given in @xcite , the @xmath2  flux expected from an ionization bounded hii region excited by a single o4 star",
    "is @xmath7 ergs / s , the corresponding number for an o8 star is @xmath8 ergs / s",
    ". these values bracket the measured @xmath2  fluxes for our galaxies .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the l - z relation for bcds used here is quite well constrained , as it leaves out the deviant extremely metal deficient ( xmd ) bcds ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "even if the galaxies considered here turn out to be xmd bcds , then the fluxes expected from the hii regions will only increase .    from the sfrs deduced using the total fuv and @xmath2  fluxes listed in table  [ tab : der ] one can also see that for all the three bcds the deduced sfr@xmath9 is @xmath10 sfr@xmath11 .",
    "this is typical for low mass galaxies @xcite . as discussed in detail in these ( and other papers ) , this is likely due to the fact that at low star formation rates , the number of massive stars that are present at any given time is subject to substantial statistical fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath2  emission ( which comes from massive m@xmath10 17  m@xmath12 stars ) will in general be weaker than that predicted from the fuv luminosity ( which comes from intermediate m @xmath10 3  m@xmath13 stars ) .",
    "a lower @xmath2  flux compared to what would be expected from the observed fuv emission and a standard salpeter imf is also predicted by the integrated galaxial initial mass function ( igimf ) theory @xcite . in this theory , the clustered nature of star formation , along with the assumption that the most massive star formed in a cluster depends on the total mass of the cluster , results in the total sampled imf to differ from the salpeter imf .",
    "the theory predicts that the fuv and @xmath2  luminosities decrease non - linearly with the total sfr ; the effect is most pronounced for galaxies with low sfrs .",
    "@xcite show that recalibrations using the igimf explain to a large extent the drastic decrease in @xmath2  luminosities for dwarf galaxies .",
    "table  [ tab : ig ] shows the recalibrated sfrs for our bcds , from both fuv and @xmath2 , for two sets of igimf models ( i.e. those called standard and minimal-1 in @xcite ) which cover the full range of igimf models .",
    "columns(2 ) and ( 3 ) are the recalibrated sfrs from fuv using calibrations given in @xcite , while columns(4 ) and ( 5 ) are the recalibrated sfrs from @xmath2  using calibrations given in @xcite .",
    "the recalibrated sfr estimates match quite well for d0958 + 66 , but for the other two bcds , the sfr as derived from @xmath2  is approximately twice the sfr estimated using fuv flux . from the above discussion , it is not clear whether there is any way to distinguish between the effects of stochasticity in high mass star formation and variable imf on the @xmath2  and fuv sfrs . but",
    "recent modelling using spectral synthesis codes of star clusters which include stochastic sampling of the imf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that in the low sfr regime it is the determining factor .",
    "the data presented in @xcite ( see their figure 1 ) is for starbursts with slightly higher fuv fluxes than in the current case , however our data is consistent with the trends shown in their figure .",
    "as those authors emphasize , stochastic sampling of the imf could occasionally result in small clusters with a disproportionate number of massive stars ( which otherwise would be evidence for a `` top heavy '' imf ) , and this appears to be the case here , especially for the galaxy d0958 + 66 .",
    "we expect that the effects of mechanical feedback from star formation into the ism would be more pronounced and easier to detect in smaller low mass galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite modelled the effects of supernova explosions from starbursts on the interstellar medium of dwarf galaxies to show that for galaxies with total gas mass @xmath14  @xmath1  a significant fraction of the ism could be expelled .",
    "this result however is sensitive to both the concentration of the starburst and the geometry of the ism .",
    "feedback from star formation is also believed to play an important role in determining the final dark matter distribution .",
    "for example , @xcite show that supernova driven outflow of low angular momentum gas from the centres of star forming galaxies inhibit the formation of bulges and can account for the shallow ( instead of cuspy ) central dark matter profiles seen for nearby gas rich dwarfs .",
    "this weakening of the central dark matter cusp occurs even if there is no escape of baryonic matter from the galaxy . on the observational front ,",
    "@xcite as well as @xcite both find evidence for feedback from star formation into the neutral ism of dwarf galaxies .",
    "but even though our galaxies represent some of the smallest mass , actively star forming systems , evidence for feedback between the star formation on the neutral gas distribution in two of them ( d0958 + 66 and d1028 + 70 ) is not clearly evident .",
    "the only evidence we see of mechanical feedback form star formation on the hi distribution is in the galaxy d1012 + 64 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chmap ] shows the hi channels maps for this galaxy at an intermediate resolution ( chosen to optimise between localising the hi emission to a particular region and having enough signal - to - noise ratio to pick up the emission ) .",
    "the stellar disc , and the integrated velocity field at the same resolution ( moment 1 map ) are shown for reference .",
    "the velocity field shows a south - east to north alignment as one moves forward in the velocity space .",
    "the channels of interest are the last two ones shown in the figure , with central heliocentric velocities of 211.5 km  s@xmath15  and 214.7 km  s@xmath15 . here",
    "the hi suddenly moves out of the south - east to north flow for increasing velocity , and returns to the central region of the hi disc of the galaxy .",
    "the noteworthy fact is that the hi emission in these two channels is right at the edge of the stellar disc , and overlapping with the @xmath2  emission coming from recent star formation ( compare with figure 3 , 2b and 2c ) . to confirm that there is high velocity hi concentrated in only one region",
    ", we plot the hi spectrum for four different regions around the peak of hi emission in figure  [ fig : spreg ] .",
    "there is statistically significant detection of hi in two channels at heliocentric velocities above 210 km  s@xmath15  in only the region to the north - east , as is seen from figure  [ fig : chmap ] too .",
    "the total mass of hi in the relevant channels is @xmath16 .",
    "taking the mean velocity difference between the channel velocities and the systematic velocity of hi ( @xmath17  km  s@xmath15 ) , the estimated kinetic energy being carried away by the gas is hence @xmath18 ergs .",
    "considering the wind mechanical energy output from an o8 star within a typical lifetime of @xmath19  myr is @xmath20  ergs @xcite , just the mechanical energy output from the @xmath2  emitting cluster in d1012 + 64 may not be enough to produce the gas outflow seen . but this much of energy can easily be accounted for even by the typical energy output of a single supernova ( i.e. @xmath21  erg ) .",
    "hence , what we see is most probably signature of neutral gas outflow associated with the star forming region of d1012 + 64 .",
    "our search for hi in the newly discovered dwarf galaxies in the m81 group has resulted in three new detections .",
    "the detected galaxies are some of the lowest mass bcds known , with star formation rates @xmath4 @xmath1/yr . the star formation can be traced by both @xmath2  and fuv emission , and as is the case for most other dwarfs , the observed @xmath2  flux is less than what would be predicted from the star formation rate deduced from the fuv .",
    "this is likely to be a result of stochastic sampling of the upper end of the mass function .",
    "the @xmath2  emission is also offset from the peak of the fuv emission .",
    "we find tentative evidence of hi gas outflow at the edge of the stellar disc of one of the galaxies . even though this result agrees with the expectation that the effects of mechanical feedback from star formation would be most directly seen in the smallest galaxies , surprisingly no clear evidence of feedback associated with star formation is seen in the hi discs of the other two galaxies .",
    "we thank the gmrt staff for having made possible the observations used in this paper .",
    "the gmrt is run by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
