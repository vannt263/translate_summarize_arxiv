    "the past few years have seen dramatic progress towards achieving the necessary conditions for demonstrating macroscopic quantum behavior in mechanical systems.@xcite schemes under investigation typically consider either micronscale mechanical resonators that are electrostatically coupled to superconducting qubits ( quantum electromechanical systems)@xcite or larger mechanical mirror resonators that couple via radiation pressure to light trapped in an optical cavity ( optomechanical systems).@xcite one of the prime motivations for demonstrating quantum behavior is to deepen our understanding of the so - called quantum - classical divide , in particular how classical dynamics emerges from the underlying quantum dynamics as system sizes ( i.e. , mass / energy content ) increase.@xcite it is commonly accepted that the environmental degrees of freedom with which the mechanical resonator s mode of interest interacts is responsible for the emergence of classicality.@xcite in particular , the environment is thought to cause the rapid decoherence of initial quantum superposition states of the mechanical mode , resulting in an apparent classical mixture of the states .",
    "there is a considerable body of theoretical work investigating the effective quantum dynamics of open , single particle systems.@xcite however , largely for reasons of calculational convenience , much of the effort has been devoted to the solvable model of an environment comprising noninteracting oscillators that are bilinearly coupled to a single oscillator system.@xcite in light of the experimental progress mentioned above , an important issue is the actual nature of the dominant mechanical resonator mode environments . at the very low ( i.e. , cryogenic ) temperatures to which the resonators must be cooled in order to observe quantum effects , it is not a priori obvious that the resonator mode dynamics can be mapped onto that of the oscillator system - oscillator bath model . in the present paper , we focus on a type of environment degree of freedom that is known to be relevant at low temperatures , namely the tunneling two level system.@xcite    tunneling two level system ( tls ) defects were first invoked in the early seventies in order to account for the observed thermodynamic properties of amorphous , dielectric materials at low temperatures.@xcite further , convincing evidence for their presence was provided by acoustic phonon pulse decay and phonon pulse echo experiments.@xcite in particular , these experiments verified the characteristic saturation of tls s with increasing acoustic pulse intensity for resonant phonon absorption and also measured tls relaxation and dephasing times .",
    "tls s have recently received renewed interest as one of the main decay / decoherence mechanisms for superconducting qubits.@xcite signatures include inducing resonant splittings in the qubit energy level spectra@xcite and saturation of microwave power absorption by the dielectric oxide layer of the qubit tunnel junctions.@xcite in contrast with the bulk amorphous dielectric materials involved earlier investigations , the much smaller , micronscale sizes of the superconducting qubits with gigahertz frequency energy level separations exceeding the dilution fridge @xmath0 thermal energies point to a distinct and less explored regime in which the system qubit resonantly couples strongly to only a few tls defects , as opposed to a dense spectrum .",
    "similarly , it may be the case that , given the much smaller volumes ( @xmath1 ) of the micronscale mechanical resonators currently under investigation , the relevant system - environment model is an oscillator interacting with only a few tls s . in the following sections we shall analyze just such a system .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimates ] we give some simple estimates based on existing bulk system tls theory in order to motivate our mechanical resonator mode - few tls model as well as to anticipate some of the consequences of tls - dominated mechanical damping / decoherence . in sec .",

    "[ sec : open ] we present the open system master equation with further details of the derivation given in the appendix .",
    "section  [ sec : damping ] focuses on the effect of a few tls s on the resonator damping , while sec .  [ sec : decoherence ] describes the consequences for the decoherence of mechanical resonator superposition states .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] provides a few concluding remarks .",
    "although the present paper focuses on the role of tls s for micronscale mechanical oscillator damping / decoherence , we do not completely neglect other mechanisms . in the spirit of keeping our model as simple as possible , we lump together all other relevant damping and decoherence mechanisms , such as clamping loss,@xcite as an additional oscillator bath to which the mechanical system mode couples",
    "this will allow us to gauge somewhat the extent to which other baths ` interfere ' with the tls bath in their damping and decoherence effects on the oscillator system .",
    "for example , the system oscillator s net damping rate need not be the sum of the damping rates due to the individual baths .",
    "one point that should be emphasized in this context is the highly nonlinear , quantum nature of the coupled oscillator - tls ( equivalently spin-@xmath2 ) dynamics .",
    "exact analytical or even simpler approximate equations are hard to come by and so we will resort to solving for the full dynamics using numerical methods",
    ". we will be limited computationally to considering only a few tlss  three to be precise . in future work",
    "we plan to find ways to analyze the effects on mechanical damping / decoherence of larger numbers of tls s .",
    "another source of nanomechanical damping and decoherence that we do not explicitly take into account is the measurement process itself.@xcite the resonator damping described in sec .",
    "[ sec : damping ] can be probed using , for example , continuous in time position detection with a single electron transistor.@xcite we shall assume that the resulting back reaction on the resonator due to the position detector can be simply modeled by the same additional oscillator bath at some finite temperature.@xcite the resonator superposition state decoherence described in sec .",
    "[ sec : decoherence ] can be probed using , for example , the microwave cavity - superconducting qubit scheme outlined in refs .",
    "in the present paper we neglect mechanical strain ( i.e. , phonon ) mediated coupling between tls s , assuming the latter to couple directly only to the oscillator system mode and with the tls s damping treated phenomenologically , characterized by a decay time @xmath3 .",
    "given our current , almost complete lack of theoretical understanding of the role of tls s for damping and decoherence in nano - to - mesoscale mechanical resonators , we feel that it is worthwhile to start with this simpler , noninteracting tls model .",
    "the low temperature acoustic pulse probe investigations of bulk amorphous solids@xcite and the mechanical quality factor and resonant frequency measurements of much larger resonators@xcite point to the likely importance of interactions between tlss.@xcite for example , phonon echo experiments yield tls dephasing times that are much shorter than their @xmath3 lifetimes , thought to be due to tls spectral diffusion arising from the phonon mediated interaction between non - resonant tlss.@xcite with the significantly reduced volumes of nano - to - mesoscale mechanical resonators , these strain interactions may in fact be considerably enhanced .",
    "we plan to analyze the effects of such tls interactions on nanomechanical damping / decoherence in a future work .",
    "in this section we adopt various results from earlier analyses of bulk , amorphous systems to try to gain some initial idea of expected consequences for damping / decoherence of nano - to - mesoscale mechanical resonators due to tls s .",
    "we begin by estimating the number magnitude of tls s that are near resonance with the mechanical mode frequency of interest , which we shall in this paper assume to be the lowest , flexural mode . for a range of bulk , amorphous solids , experiments are consistent with a tls distribution of the form@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mechanical resonator volume ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the asymmetry and tunnel splitting energies of the tls s potential double well ( see fig .",
    "[ beamtls ] ) , and @xmath8 is the approximately constant spectral density that can be expressed as @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the mass density , @xmath11 is the deformation potential ( approximated as isotropic ) and @xmath12 is the speed of sound ( approximated as isotropic and polarization independent ) .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath13 is approximately universal.@xcite of course , the nanomechanical resonator may not be fashioned out of one of the amorphous materials surveyed in ref .",
    "[ ] , but instead out of a crystalline material .",
    "in such a case we view eq .",
    "( [ distributioneq ] ) and the estimates we shall now derive for the total tls number as providing an upper bound . integrating eq .",

    "we next estimate the nanomechanical fundamental mode displacement amplitudes that saturate the tls s .",

    "we see that the saturation threshold strain is given by @xmath34 for the example of a doubly - clamped beam mechanical resonator of length @xmath35 , thickness @xmath36 , and midpoint @xmath37 transverse displacement amplitude @xmath38 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] ) , the volume averaged , rms strain is @xmath39 . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ saturationeq ] ) and expressing in terms of natural units , we obtain @xmath40 earlier phonon echo experiments in fused silica glass found tls damping and transverse relaxation times @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , at @xmath43.@xcite thus , the transverse relaxation is dominated by dephasing : @xmath44 .",
    "given that quantum zero - point displacement uncertainties of micron - scale mechanical resonators are @xmath45,@xcite which , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ saturation2eq ] ) , exceed the saturation threshold , we thus expect that experiments which measure damping and decoherence of such resonators will operate well into the saturation regime . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ gammabulkeq ] ) , one important consequence is that resonant tls dominated damping is expected to be amplitude dependent , corresponding to a nonlinear damping force that depends on both the position and velocity coordinates of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "our final approximation concerns the decoherence of mechanical superposition states . for weak mechanical damping ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) and provided temperatures are not too low ( i.e. , @xmath47 )",
    ", the effective dynamics of an oscillator bilinearly interacting with a bath of free oscillators satisfies a quantum fluctuation - dissipation relation between the system oscillator s damping and decoherence rates : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the uncertainty in the oscillator s position and @xmath50 is the oscillator s quantum zeropoint position uncertainty . assuming that this fluctuation - dissipation relation applies also to the bulk oscillator with the tls bath , we can substitute in expression  ( [ gammabulkeq ] ) for the damping rate to obtain the decoherence rate .",
    "the first thing to notice is the cancellation of the hyperbolic temperature functions . below the saturation threshold",
    "we would therefore conclude that the decoherence rate is temperature _ independent _ while the damping rate is temperature dependent for an oscillator coupled to a tls bath . in this respect ,",
    "the oscillator system - tls bath is ` dual ' to the oscillator system - oscillator bath in the sense that the decoherence rate of the latter has the inverse temperature dependence of the damping rate of the former , while the damping rate of the latter and decoherence rate of the former are both temperature - independent.@xcite however , this duality is to a certain extent academic since the above saturation estimates suggest that nano - to - mesoscale mechanical resonators will be well within the saturation regime for quantum superpositions of distinct position states that must necessarily be larger than the zeropoint position uncertainty . as a consequence , the temperature dependences of the tls @xmath3 and @xmath31 dependent terms must also be taken into account .",
    "since a good understanding of the relaxation mechanisms of tls s is lacking in nano - to - mesoscale mechanical resonators,@xcite we will not attempt to make predictions for the temperature dependences of various observable quantities in the present paper .",
    "leaving aside temperature dependencies , another notable consequence of applying the above quantum fluctuation - dissipation relation to the oscillator system - tls bath is the weaker ( i.e. , linear ) dependence of the decoherence rate on oscillator position uncertainty .",
    "thus , at low temperatures we might expect the decoherence rate to increase more gradually as the position separation in the quantum superposition state is increased , as compared with the quadratic separation dependence for the oscillator bath .",
    "of course , other decoherence mechanisms , e.g , due to clamping loss , will then be expected to eventually dominate if they have the stronger quadratic dependence .    summarizing the findings of this section",
    ", we expect that a relevant model for a nano - to - micronscale mechanical resonator interacting with tls s is a single oscillator coupled to a bath of a few tls s .",
    "furthermore , we expect that mechanical damping will show an amplitude dependence , while the decoherence of mechanical superposition states will depend weakly on their position separation .",
    "the following sections will bear out these expectations .",
    "in this section we will derive the hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the lowest , fundamental flexural mode of a doubly - clamped beam mechanical resonator interacting with tls s that are located randomly throughout the beam volume .",
    "related analyses are given in refs .",

    "<S> in contrast with a resonator interacting bilinearly with an ohmic free oscillator bath ( modeling clamping loss , for example ) , the mechanical resonator damping is amplitude dependent , while the decoherence of quantum superpositions of mechanical position states depends only weakly on their spatial separation . </S>"
