    "during the last decade , there have been great theoretical and experimental efforts to understand surface growth .",
    "this is due to possible applications , @xmath0 , to the production of thin films and , from the basic point of view , to the interesting examples growing surfaces provide of non - equilibrium statistical systems @xcite , in some cases with strong relation to relevant equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "a very important example is provided by the discrete gaussian ( dg ) model , which describes the universal features of the equilibrium roughening transition of many surfaces @xcite .",
    "this transition is in the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) class , and thus the model is related to other important models featuring a similar transition , such as the f model or the coulomb gas @xcite .",
    "the dg model describes a surface minimizing surface area ( to linear approximation ) , in which the surface height takes on integer values . relaxing the latter condition leads to the sine - gordon ( sg ) model for a real valued height field subject to surface tension and to a ( lattice ) potential favouring integer values of the field .",
    "the sg model is amenable to approximate analytic treatments @xcite which have allowed to develop a rather complete picture of the equilibrium roughening transition , and of the surface near - equilibrium properties as determined by langevin dynamics @xcite or kinetic monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "there exist surface growth contexts , such as growth by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , in which the most relevant relaxation mechanism taking place at the surface is surface diffusion @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , can be modelled as a surface minimizing curvature , instead of surface area . in reference",
    "@xcite , the following stochastic equation was proposed to study the interplay of this mechanism with a lattice potential favouring integer height values , similarly to the sg model @xmath1 in ( [ ourmodel ] ) , @xmath2 is the surface height above ( a two - dimensional ) substrate position @xmath3 at time @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the two dimensional laplacian and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are positive constants .",
    "@xmath9 is also a constant representing , @xmath0 , a driving flux of particles inducing the system to grow .",
    "@xmath10 is a gaussian white noise with zero average and correlations @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being temperature ( we consider a unit boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 ) . in equilibrium ( @xmath14 )",
    ", this equation governs the thermal fluctuations of a surface described by ( the continuum limit of ) the hamiltonian @xmath15 ^ 2 + v_0\\left[1-\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi h_i}{{a_{\\bot } } } \\right)\\right]\\right\\},\\qquad h_i \\in { \\mathbb r } .\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes a nearest neighbour to site @xmath17 . in @xcite ,",
    "numerical simulations of ( [ ourmodel ] ) showed an equilibrium roughening transition , similar to that in the sg model ; namely , for temperatures below a critical value @xmath18 the lattice potential is relevant and the surface is flat , whereas for temperatures higher than @xmath18 the surface is rough . out of equilibrium ( @xmath19 ) , the surface mobility ( to be defined below ) behaves in different ways , depending on @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "although these simulations have been extended @xcite , no analytical approach had been made to study this model . in this paper",
    "we take a first step in this direction and apply to model ( [ ourmodel])-([lrhamcont ] ) a variational mean - field approach successfully applied by saito @xcite to the study of the sg model . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will refine this study by means of a dynamic renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of ( [ ourmodel ] ) .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ br ]",
    "we briefly review the relationship between ( [ ourmodel])-([lrhamcont ] ) and related models for which approximate analytical and/or numerical results are available . in section [ seceq ]",
    "we study the equilibrium hamiltonian ( [ lrhamcont ] ) within the variational scheme of @xcite .",
    "section [ secdyn ] is devoted to the approximate study of the langevin dynamics ( [ ourmodel ] ) within a gaussian approximation for the probability distribution of the height .",
    "a discussion of the results obtained and our conclusions are found in section [ concl ] .",
    "some computational details on the solution of self - consistent equations relevant to section [ seceq ] can be found in appendix [ appena ] , while appendix [ appenb ] discusses how the results are modified when considering the model on a triangular lattice ( as opposed to the square lattice studied in the rest of the paper ) , and appendix [ appenc ] contains a discussion on results for substrate dimensions different from two .",
    "crystal surfaces are often described within the solid - on - solid ( sos ) approximation , in which the surface is characterized by a two - dimensional lattice height variable @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath17 being the square lattice position on a @xmath22 dimensional substrate .",
    "perhaps the simplest model is the discrete gaussian model ( dg ) mentioned in the introduction , whose hamiltonian is ( we take a unit lattice constant ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a positive constant . due to the difficulty to handle analytically the discrete sums in ( [ hamdg ] ) , a continuum approximation is adopted introducing a potential that preserves the periodic symmetry in ( [ hamdg ] ) and favours integer height values , leading to the sine - gordon ( sg ) model ( for reviews , see @xcite ) @xmath25\\qquad h_i \\in { \\mathbb r } .\\ ] ] both models undergo a kt - type roughening transition at a finite temperature @xmath26 between a flat and a rough phase . in the flat phase the roughness @xmath27 [ where @xmath28 is finite and @xmath29-independent , while in the rough phase it diverges with the system size as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , as if we take @xmath32 in ( [ genhamcont ] ) . in the flat phase , the lattice potential dominates and imposes a finite correlation length @xmath33 . for @xmath34",
    "the lattice potential becomes irrelevant , although it modifies @xcite the value of the surface tension @xmath24 , and the correlation length diverges .",
    "specifically , @xmath35 for @xmath36 .    as mentioned in the introduction , our aim is to study surfaces in which minimization of surface area is replaced by minimization of surface curvature , and we will thus replace model ( [ genhamcont ] ) by the hamiltonian ( [ lrhamcont ] ) proposed in @xcite . interestingly , in the context of two - dimensional melting , nelson @xcite proposed ( on the triangular lattice ) the so called laplacian roughening model @xmath37 ^ 2,\\qquad h_i /{a_{\\bot}}\\in { \\mathbb z } .\\ ] ] in equilibrium , numerical simulations and rg studies ( see references in @xcite ) indicate that ( [ lrham ] ) displays two phase transitions , both in the kt universality class , with an hexatic phase between the two transition temperatures .",
    "however , the conclusions of analytical and numerical work by other authors ( see a review in @xcite ) seem to be that model ( [ lrham ] ) features only one first order phase transition . note model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) is a natural continuum approximation of ( [ lrham ] ) in the same spirit as the sg model is an approximation of the dg model .",
    "the numerical study @xcite of langevin dynamics ( [ ourmodel ] ) for ( [ lrhamcont ] ) found an equilibrium continuous roughening transition between a flat phase and a rough phase in which @xmath38 , the same behaviour of the so called linear mbe equation [ that obtained by setting @xmath39 in ( [ ourmodel ] ) ] .",
    "nevertheless , since the lattice potential modifies the value of the ( in principle zero ) surface tension , the long distance behaviour of the high temperature phase of model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) was expected to be the same as that in the sg model . in what follows",
    "we apply saito s variational treatment to ( [ lrhamcont ] ) and ( [ ourmodel ] ) . in the case of the sg model ,",
    "such mean field study @xcite allows to obtain the exact value of the roughening temperature , and a rather approximate estimation of the divergence of the correlation length near @xmath26 .",
    "thus we expect to obtain relevant information from this mean - field scheme .",
    "following saito @xcite , our main assumption is that the most relevant features of model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) can be described by a simpler , solvable hamiltonian : @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the fourier components of the height field @xmath42 here we consider periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , @xmath43 with @xmath44 and a similar relation holds for @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ h0 ] ) defines a gaussian hamiltonian in which the values of @xmath46 are @xmath47 free parameters .",
    "we will fix them by minimization of the variational free energy @xmath48 , which is known to be an upper bound of the exact free energy @xmath49 of model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) by the bogoliubov thermodynamic inequality @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the free energy of model @xmath52 and @xmath53 stands for the average with respect to the boltzmann factor @xmath54 . using the hamiltonians ( [ lrhamcont ] ) and ( [ h0 ] ) we obtain for the rhs of equation ( [ bog ] ) @xmath55 s({{\\bi{q } } } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{l^2 v_0}{t } \\left\\{1-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi^2}{a_{\\bot}^2}w^2\\right)\\right\\ } \\label{fvlrham } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath56 with @xmath57 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath58 ( note that model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) is symmetric under @xmath59 and thus , in equilibrium , @xmath60 ) . by minimizing @xmath61 with respect to the parameters @xmath46",
    ", we find they have to verify @xmath62 we can rewrite ( [ defsqb ] ) by noting that the second term on the rhs does not depend on @xmath63 .",
    "hence @xmath64 where @xmath33 is a constant given by the self - consistent relation [ note @xmath65 depends on @xmath33 through ( [ roughness ] ) and ( [ sqeq ] ) ] @xmath66 equations ( [ sqeq ] ) and ( [ xieq ] ) are the solution to the equilibrium problem .",
    "we observe that the variational ( gaussian ) approximation of hamiltonian ( [ lrhamcont ] ) has a structure factor @xmath46 similar to that of the linear mbe equation .",
    "the only effect of the potential is to introduce a correlation length @xmath33 given self - consistently by equations ( [ xieq ] ) and ( [ sqeq ] ) . among all mathematical solutions of equation ( [ xieq ] ) ,",
    "the best approximation to model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) is given by that value of @xmath33 that minimizes the variational free energy @xmath61 , which we denote by @xmath67 .",
    "note all roots of equation ( [ xieq ] ) can be easily shown to be stationary points of the function @xmath68 .    in order to proceed analytically , we need to take the continuum limit of the integrals appearing in ( [ fvlrham ] ) , ( [ roughness ] ) . in this limit , we make the replacement @xmath69 , and we can approximate @xmath70 , hence using equation ( [ sqeq ] ) we get @xmath71 keeping the dominant term in the above equation ( in powers of @xmath33 ) , and defining @xmath72 equation ( [ xieq ] ) becomes @xmath73 where @xmath74 . as shown in appendix [ appena ] , there are different solutions of equation ( [ xieq1 ] ) depending on @xmath75 ( and therefore on temperature ) .",
    "thus , @xmath76 is always a solution of ( [ xieq1 ] ) , and is the unique solution for @xmath77 .",
    "however , for @xmath78 there appear two other finite solutions @xmath79 of equation ( [ xieq1 ] ) . in order to check which of the three roots",
    "provides @xmath67 in this temperature range , we compute the free energy difference @xmath80 \\simeq \\frac{\\xi^{-2}}{16 } - \\frac{v_0}{t } { \\mathrm{e}}^{-t\\pi^2 \\xi^2 /   ( 4 \\kappa a_{\\bot}^2 ) } + { { \\cal o}}(\\xi^{-4}).\\ ] ] we plot @xmath81 in figure [ fig1 ] for different values of @xmath12 .    for @xmath78 , as can be seen in the figure , @xmath81 has indeed a local maximum at @xmath82 and a local minimum at @xmath83 , while for @xmath84 both disappear .",
    "as derived in appendix [ appena ] , for temperatures above @xmath85 , the variational free energy difference has its global minimum at @xmath86 . however , for lower temperatures",
    "@xmath87 , the finite correlation length @xmath88 features a lower value of the variational free energy than the infinite correlation length solution , hence @xmath89 in this temperature range . summarizing",
    ", within the variational approximation a roughening transition takes place at a temperature @xmath90 above @xmath18 the correlation length is infinite and the surface is rough , with the same properties as the linear mbe model , i.e.  @xmath91 and @xmath38 . below @xmath18 the surface is flat with a finite correlation length equal to @xmath88 . when we approach the roughening temperature from below , the correlation length does _ not _ diverge but , rather , tends to a constant value ( see appendix [ appena ] ) given by @xmath92 implying the roughening transition at @xmath18 is of first order .",
    "specifically , a cusp develops in the free energy @xmath61 as a function of temperature at @xmath93 , as depicted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "although the results in this section have been obtained using a certain continuum approximation , we have numerically verified all our conclusions using the exact discrete sums in ( [ fvlrham ] ) and ( [ roughness ] ) .",
    "the exact variational results for the correlation length and the values of @xmath94 and @xmath18 for @xmath95 are compared in figure [ fig2 ] to the approximate analytical expressions obtained in this section .",
    "we see that a first order transition indeed takes place , although the values of @xmath18 and @xmath94 are modified .",
    "however , we still observe the non - linear dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath7 , see inset of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "in this section , we study the near - equilibrium dynamics of model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) by means of the generalized langevin growth equation @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a white noise with correlations @xmath98 and @xmath9 is the flux of incoming particles in the surface growth picture , or a chemical potential difference in a generic context .",
    "this equation describes not only the non - equilibrium statistical dynamics of our model , but also the dynamics of the system fluctuations around the equilibrium state ( for @xmath14 ) .",
    "our approximation @xcite to the study of equation ( [ ourmodel ] ) will be to assume a gaussian time - dependent probability distribution for the height field .",
    "thus , we only have to calculate the first two moments of the probability distribution , namely the mean height is independent of substrate position , see @xcite . ] @xmath99 and the second moment @xmath100 .",
    "using equations ( [ lrhamcont ] ) and ( [ langevin ] ) ( see a detailed account in @xcite ) we find @xmath101 \\\\ &   & = -4 t s({{\\bi{q}}},t ) \\",
    ", \\frac{\\delta { { \\cal f}}_v}{\\delta s({{\\bi{q}}},t ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , within our gaussian approximation , @xmath102 with @xmath103 being the time dependent surface roughnes . in all cases",
    ", we will study the set of coupled differential equations ( [ meangauss1 ] ) and ( [ meangauss2 ] ) subject to the initial condition @xmath104 for all substrate positions @xmath17 .      in equilibrium ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath14 , the solution of equation ( [ meangauss1 ] ) is @xmath105 [ note ( [ meancossin ] ) ] and the solution of ( [ meangauss2 ] ) is the same as that of ( [ defsqb ] ) and ( [ xieq ] ) obtained in the previous section .",
    "the interest of equation ( [ meangauss2 ] ) is that it allows us to study dynamically how does the system choose the physical value of the correlation length , and corroborate the results obtained in the previous section from the point of view of langevin dynamics .",
    "thus , we will integrate numerically the complete set of @xmath47 discrete equations ( [ meangauss1 ] ) and ( [ meangauss2 ] ) and perform the following experiment : starting from a flat surface and @xmath106 , we increase temperature by a certain ( small ) amount and wait until the system reaches equilibrium . then , we increase temperature by the same amount and repeat the equilibration process . when the temperature is high enough (",
    "i.e.  once the system is in the rough phase ) we decrease temperature by the same amount and repeat the process of equilibration until @xmath107 is reached back closing a temperature cycle .",
    "we observe that the equilibrium first order transition found in the previous section indeed induces hysteresis in the system correlation length ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) when the system is heated starting from @xmath106 , in the sense that the roughening transition takes place at the _ higher _ temperature @xmath94 and _ not _ at @xmath18 .",
    "the reason is that , for all @xmath12 up to @xmath94 , the system stays in the local @xmath61 minimum at @xmath88 , even though for @xmath108 the free energy already has its global minimum at @xmath109 , since there is an energy barrier for the system to jump across the local maximum in @xmath110 .",
    "once the local minimum at @xmath88 disappears ( i.e.  for @xmath111 ) , the surface is rough and exhibits an infinite correlation length .",
    "conversely , when the system is cooled down starting at @xmath84 , the system remains in the rough phase until @xmath106 is reached because @xmath109 is always a free energy minimum .      in this section",
    "we allow @xmath19 in ( [ meangauss1 ] ) and ( [ meangauss2 ] ) , in which case the former no longer has the trivial solution ( @xmath105 ) . rather , when the flux @xmath9 is small ( quasi - equilibrium condition ) we expect the system to feature a structure factor @xmath112 of the same form as in equilibrium , all non - equilibrium effects reflecting in the ( possibly non - trivial ) behaviour of the average height",
    "actually , numerical simulations @xcite of the full non - linear model ( [ ourmodel ] ) seem to confirm this expectation . for this reason we neglect the feedback effect of the evolution of @xmath113 on the structure factor @xmath112 and take @xmath114 where @xmath33 is given by the physical equilibrium solution of section [ seceq ] . within this approximation",
    ", @xmath115 becomes a constant and equation ( [ meangauss1 ] ) can be written as @xmath116 which is simple to integrate analytically ( exact expressions for the solution can be found in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this equation has two different solutions depending on the values of @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath117 , then @xmath118 tends to a constant value and the surface does not grow .",
    "if we define the surface mobility @xmath119 as @xmath120 where the overline stands for average over a time larger than @xmath121 , then for @xmath122 one obtains from the exact solution of ( [ meangauss4 ] ) a non - zero value for @xmath119 : @xmath123 in figure [ fig4 ] we plot the surface mobility as a function of @xmath12 . using the equilibrium solution for @xmath33 described in section [ seceq ] , for temperatures above roughening ( @xmath124 ) , we have that @xmath125 , which implies @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "thus , above roughening the surface shows linear growth with a maximum ( unit ) mobility . in the flat phase ( @xmath128 ) the mobility is equal to zero ( i.e.  the surface does not move ) for a small flux @xmath129 . for larger values of the flux ( @xmath130 )",
    ", the mobility depends nonlinearly on @xmath12 for all temperatures up to @xmath18 . due to the jump of the correlation length at @xmath93",
    ", the mobility also has a jump at this temperature value .",
    "these three behaviours of the surface mobility as a function of temperature and driving flux agree with those obtained @xcite for the full model ( [ ourmodel ] ) , except for the discrete jump of @xmath119 at @xmath93 .",
    "summarizing the equilibrium results obtained in the previous sections , the variational approximation predicts a first order phase transition for model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) , and the associated hysteresis phenomenon .",
    "in particular , within a gaussian approximation , langevin dynamics predicts that a rough surface can preserve its infinite correlation length when cooled down across the roughening temperature .",
    "moreover we have found that these results apply both on the square and on the triangular lattices ( see appendix [ appenb ] ) .",
    "hysteresis behaviour and a first order transition have been reported in @xcite and @xcite for models related with the laplacian roughening ( lr ) model ( [ lrham ] ) on the square lattice and for the lr model on the triangular lattice @xcite . however , as mentioned in the introduction , other authors seem to obtain two kt transitions for the lr model both on the square @xcite and on the triangular @xcite lattices .",
    "note that our langevin dynamics results within the gaussian approximation yield a discrete jump in the surface mobility @xmath119 at @xmath18 , which is not found in simulations of the full nonlinear model ( [ ourmodel ] ) .",
    "this might indicate that the first order character of the transition is in our case an artifact of the variational approximation .",
    "moreover , this approximation ( see appendix [ appenc ] ) also predicts a phase transition for model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) in @xmath131 , which is also obtained for the sg model .",
    "this result points out the limitations of this approximate framework for situations in which fluctuations are very relevant for the system behaviour ( as in the @xmath131 case ) .",
    "since model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) features intrinsically strong fluctuations ( as does @xmath0 the linear mbe equation @xcite ) , it is desirable to go beyond our present mean field approach to this model .",
    "we can take two steps in this direction .",
    "one ( numerical ) is to perform extended simulations of both the lr model and model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) [ or , equivalently , its equilibrium langevin dynamics ( [ ourmodel ] ) ] .",
    "the results @xcite seem to indicate that in _ both _ cases there is only one continuum transition , though with strong size dependence in the lr case for sizes up to moderate ( but not large ) . the other ( analytical ) improvement is to perform a dynamic rg analysis of ( [ ourmodel ] ) along the lines of @xcite for the sg model .",
    "this study is particularly important bearing in mind that the lattice potential is expected to contribute a surface tension , absent in equation ( [ ourmodel ] ) , which should then dominate the scaling behaviour as compared with surface diffusion @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is clearly beyond our mean - field approach , which neglects parameter renormalization .",
    "moreover , comparing with the sg case , in the latter the variational mean field @xcite and the perturbative ( in powers of @xmath7 ) rg @xcite approaches yield the _ same _ ( exact ) roughening temperature @xmath132 , which is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "however , in our case @xmath18 does depend on the lattice potential ( and on @xmath6 ) as a fractional power .",
    "thus , we do not expect a perturbative rg treatment to quantitatively agree with the expression for @xmath18 derived here",
    ". this will be the subject of a forthcoming publication .",
    "the authors are pleased to thank angel snchez for discussions , encouragement and a detailed reading of the manuscript . this work has been partially supported by dges grant no .",
    "pb96 - 0119 .",
    "in this appendix we calculate the self - consistent solution of equations ( [ sqeq ] ) and ( [ xieq ] ) for the equilibrium correlation length of the variational approximation ( [ h0 ] ) to model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) . by defining @xmath72 and @xmath74 , equations ( [ sqeq ] ) and ( [ xieq ] ) become , within the continuum approximation made in section [ seceq ] @xmath133 it is obvious that equation ( [ eqtipo ] ) always has the solution @xmath134 , and that for some values of @xmath75 it may also have non - zero solutions .",
    "our first aim is to determine the critical value of @xmath75 for which @xmath134 is the unique solution . to this end , we rewrite the equation in the following way @xmath135 now the solutions are the intersections of the function @xmath136 with the straight line @xmath137",
    ". as we can see in figure [ fig5 ] ,    for @xmath138 there are three solutions of equation ( [ eqtipo1 ] ) , two solutions for @xmath139 and only the trivial solution @xmath134 for @xmath140 .",
    "the value of @xmath141 can be calculated using that for @xmath139 the unique solution @xmath142 verifies ( [ eqtipo1 ] ) and also the equation @xmath143 obtained by requiring that the slopes of @xmath137 and @xmath144 be equal at @xmath145 . with these two equations",
    "it is easy to obtain @xmath146 and @xmath147 . using the definition of @xmath75 , the temperature for which @xmath76 is the only solution of equation ( [ xieq ] )",
    "is then given by @xmath148 now , for @xmath149 we have to determine which of the three solutions of ( [ eqtipo ] ) provides the physical correlation length .",
    "since @xmath109 is the unique solution for high temperatures , we take as a reference value @xmath150 , and note that @xmath151 is stationary at any root of equation ( [ xieq ] ) .",
    "thus , we will consider as the physical solution for the correlation length that root of ( [ xieq ] ) for which @xmath61 has an absolute minimum .",
    "starting out with high temperatures , the condition @xmath152 will signal the temperature at ( and below ) which @xmath109 ceases to be the global minimum of the variational free energy and thus the system physical correlation length . using our previous notation , the condition @xmath152 reads @xmath153 where @xmath154 . using the same argument as above",
    ", it is easy to show that for @xmath155 there are non - zero solutions of ( [ eqtipo3 ] ) .",
    "this means , using the definition of @xmath156 , that there is a temperature given by @xmath157 such that for @xmath158 the global minimum of the free energy is attained for a correlation length @xmath159 , whereas for @xmath160 the physical solution is @xmath125 .",
    "the laplacian roughening model was initially proposed by nelson on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worth studying how do the features of our model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) change when the substrate geometry is different from the square lattice considered in the text .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that only nonuniversal quantities such as the transition temperature and the numerical value of correlation length depend upon the lattice geometry . the laplacian roughening model on the triangular lattice is given by @xmath161 ^ 2\\ ] ] with @xmath16 being any of the six nearest neighbours of site @xmath17 .",

    "one can readily reproduce all the results obtained in the text , simply by making the replacements @xmath176 and @xmath177 . in conclusion , on the triangular lattice a first order",
    "roughening transition is also obtained , the only effect of the geometry being a shift in the value of the roughening temperature @xmath178 .      in this appendix",
    "we discuss the possibility to find a roughening transition in equilibrium when model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) is defined on a substrate of generic dimension @xmath180 . in that case , equation ( [ xieq ] ) is still valid , but with @xmath181 within the continuum limit . for substrate dimension @xmath182 , the integral ( [ roughddim ] )",
    "is finite for @xmath109 , namely @xmath183 $ ] ( where @xmath184 is the @xmath180-dimensional angular integral @xmath185 $ ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath76 is no longer a solution of equation ( [ xieq ] ) .",
    "therefore the system has no rough solution and is in the flat phase for all temperatures . on the other hand , for @xmath186 , the integral above",
    "may be approximated by @xmath187 in this case , @xmath76 is always solution of equation ( [ xieq ] ) , there being two additional finite solutions when @xmath188",
    ". the value of @xmath189 can be calculated using the same argument as in @xmath190 and is @xmath191 in order to know which solution of equation ( [ xieq ] ) minimizes the variational free energy , we calculate @xmath110 , which now reads @xmath192 in this case , the local minimum @xmath193 is also the global minimum and the physical solution for temperatures below the roughening temperature ( @xmath194 ) , which is given by @xmath195 for temperatures above roughening ( @xmath196 ) , @xmath76 provides the global free energy minimum .",
    "thus , for @xmath186 there is a first order roughening transition at @xmath197 .",
    "note this includes @xmath131 , which might seem conflictive since in this case model ( [ lrhamcont ] ) is expected to be in the rough phase for all values of @xmath12 @xcite : in @xmath131 thermal fluctuations are expected to destroy the ordered flat phase for any temperature value .",
    "our result can be understood by noting that @xmath61 is _ not _ a true free energy , in the sense that it is not the free energy of any model is @xmath51 .",
