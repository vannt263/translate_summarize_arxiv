    "the presence of strong , globally - organized magnetic fields in hot , massive stars is rare . to date , only a handful of massive o - type stars are known to host magnetic fields . in 2009 , grunhut et al . reported the discovery of a strong magnetic field in the weak - wind o9iv star hd 57682 from the presence of zeeman signatures in mean least - squares deconvolved ( lsd )",

    "their analysis of the @xmath2 and optical spectra determined the following atmospheric and wind properties : @xmath3kk , @xmath4 , @xmath5@xmath6 , @xmath7@xmath8 , and @xmath9@xmath8yr@xmath10 .",
    "both the longitudinal magnetic field and h@xmath0 equivalent width of hd 57682 are strongly variable . in addtion to our 17 espadons observations , we ve also utilized h@xmath0 observations from amateur spectroscopy from the bess database , as well archival eso uves and feros observations dating back over a decade .",
    "a period search of these data resulted in a period of @xmath1131d , consistent with the rotational period estimated by grunhut et al .",
    "however , the magnetic data could not be reasonable phased with this period . ultimately , adopting a period of 63.58d ( twice the period obtained from the h@xmath0 data ) resulted in a coherent phasing of all the data at our disposal , as shown in fig .",

    "the longitudinal magnetic field appears to vary sinusoidally , consistent with a magnetic field dominated by a strong dipolar component .",
    "the h@xmath0 equivalent width shows a double - wave pattern with peak emission occurring at the magnetic crossover phases ( i.e. when the longitudinal field is null ) .",
    "the photometric light curve from hipparcos shows no apparent variability .",
    "this likely indicates that the column density of the magnetically confined plasma is relatively low at eclipse phases .",

    "using the longitudinal component of the magnetic field , measured from the mean lsd stokes @xmath1 and @xmath12 profiles , we are able to fit a dipole model , characterized by the magnetic field strength at the poles ( @xmath13 ) and the angle of obliquity of the magnetic axis relative to the rotation axis ( @xmath14 ) . using the @xmath15 and radius as determined by grunhut et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and assuming rigid rotation , we can infer an inclination angle @xmath16 . using this value",
    "we obtain the @xmath17 landscape as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 shown in fig .",

    "[ chisq ] we also show the residual variations of h@xmath0 phased with the adopted rotational period .",
    "we conclude based on the characteristics of this dynamic spectrum that the magnetic field is exerting strong confinement ( confinement parameter @xmath20 ; ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) on the weak wind of hd 57682 , resulting in the h@xmath0 variability .",
    "however , the slow rotation is likely unable to centrifugally support a stable magnetosphere .",
    "therefore , the plasma that is present likely has a relatively short residence time in the magnetosphere , and must therefore be continually replenished ( see townsend et al .",
