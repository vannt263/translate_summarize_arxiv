    "ams-02 2014 measurements of cosmic rays ( cr ) leptons @xcite , which have confirmed the rise of the positron fraction for kinetic energy above @xmath3 , up to @xmath4 , have stimulated different interpretations of this excess of positrons as primary evidence of dark matter ( dm ) annihilation .",
    "the interpretation of dm as a new source of positrons , to explain the departure from the pure secondary positron fraction , can be tested with other complementary and independent indirect measurements , as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "in fact , if dm particles self - annihilate at a sufficient rate , the expected signal would be directly sensitive to their thermally averaged cross section and it could have drawn an imprint on cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "the aim of the present letter is to discuss the link between the dm annihilation cross sections at freeze - out , recombination and in the milky way galactic halo , which is essential to compare different indirect constraints on dm itself .",
    "the three different physical quantities are defined by the environment in three different epochs .",
    "the relation between them is not trivial , not a simply decreasing function and so it must be carefully analyzed to put coherent constraints on dm properties . once defined a consistent framework , one can compare information from cr physics with cmb observations .",
    "+ the need of a high thermally averaged annihilation cross section , not purely thermal , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 , comes from the above mentioned observation of a huge excess in the cr positron fraction , in contrast with the expected behavior of secondaries produced in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in order to describe this experimental evidence",
    ", a very high annihilation cross section has to be invoked , compared with typical expectation for a s - wave annihilating thermal relic matching the observed dm abundance @xcite .",
    "+ the main way to interpret the positron excess is the sommerfeld enhancement @xcite , a non - perturbative quantum effect which modifies the annihilation cross section in the regime of small relative velocity of the annihilating particles and in presence of an effectively long - range force between them . indeed , this well - known quantum mechanical effect can occur in dm annihilations in the galactic halo , if the two annihilating particles exchange an interaction mediated by a force carrier . from a feynman diagram point of view , the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) interact with the new boson through a multi - box diagram , depicted in fig .  [ fig : feynman ] , annihilate into @xmath6 , and the decay of @xmath7 produces more light leptons than expected .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section  [ sec : two ] the basic setup of the sommerfeld enhancement and the relation between the galactic halo cross section and the one at recombination are briefly reviewed ; in section  [ sec : three ] we report a collection of cr best fits for tev - ish dm candidates capable to reproduce the observed positron excess and we discuss the main sources of uncertainties ( from cr physics and the dm sector ) , in order to compare predictions with cmb constraints and obtain some general remarks in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement is fundamental to interpret indirect dm searches .",
    "the thermally averaged dm annihilation cross section ( at any time ) can be generally decomponed into powers of the velocity @xmath8 @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath8 is the relative velocity of the annihilating particles , that is @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the constant s - wave term , @xmath12 is the p - wave term and @xmath13 the sommerfeld term where @xmath14 stands for a proper asymptotic ( cut - off ) value for the low velocity regime .",
    "the quadratic and quartic terms in eq .",
    "are commonly neglected at a freeze - out description , whereas the so called sommerfeld term is suppressed in the relativistic velocities regime @xcite .",
    "+ the enhancement of the s - wave for these velocities is defined by the ratio of the masses of the dm candidate and the sommerfeld boson @xmath7 which provides the boosted annihilation , and by the effective coupling @xmath15 . defining the dimensionless parameter @xmath16 ,",
    "the condition for the enhancement is @xmath17 , that is @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "( @xmath8 in natural unit on the abscissa ) .",
    "see @xcite for insights.,height=226 ]    in fig .  [",
    "fig : crosssection ] the different contributions to the total dm annihilation cross section are shown according to eq .  .",
    "it can be noted that the sommerfeld contribution is a function of the redshift @xmath20 but , after a particular value of @xmath8 ( @xmath21 ) , which is very close to the one expected for our dark halo , the quantum effect reaches a plateau that is approximately 100 times the thermal annihilation cross section , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath22 . here",
    "one can notice that there should be necessarily a slow velocity limit , given by the finite range of the attractive force mediated by @xmath7 : once the de broglie wavelength of the particle @xmath23 exceeds the range of the interaction @xmath24 , the quantum effect saturates reaching the value @xmath25 , that is a constant and does not depend on @xmath8 @xcite",
    ". moreover , for specific values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the ratio of @xmath8 to the speed of light @xmath29 , resonant threshold states can be produced ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sommerfeld ] ) which are capable of further boosting @xmath30 @xcite , inducing @xmath31 .",
    "plane @xcite.,height=226 ]    after cosmological recombination , dm had a velocity proportional to the inverse of the scale factor of the expanding universe because of its free stream , justifying very small velocity values ; on the other hand , the virialized velocities in a today galactic halo might be at least three order of magnitude greater .",
    "+ the status of the three cross sections in the previously mentioned regimes can be basically summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "_ freeze - out_. during this phase the cross section is usually assumed to be nearly constant , without the general contribution of other even powers of @xmath8 .",
    "this is an absolute minimum from which the annihilation cross section evolves during the cooling of the universe . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crosssection ] , for  too relativistic ",
    "freeze - out velocities , the p - wave term would enhance the annihilation cross section of one order of magnitude , generating an incompatibility w.r.t . the expected relic density at redshift @xmath32 .",
    "for this regime the relative velocity is : |_z 1000 = _ 0.3 c and the following relation for the cross section holds : ^ _",
    "~310 ^ -26  cm^3  s^-1 .",
    "recombination_. here the annihilation cross section has a greater value than the freeze - out one , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath33",
    ". this does not imply the relation @xmath34 , because the quantum sommerfeld enhancement saturates after a certain velocity @xmath35 , which is @xmath36 .",
    "so , for @xmath37 the quantum sommerfeld boost @xmath38 does not increase the annihilation cross section further .",
    "this is the annihilation cross section measured by cmb experiments . in this regime",
    "the relative velocity of the dm particles is very low : |_600<z<1000 = _ ~10 ^ -(86)c and the annihilation cross section is clearly dominated by the sommerfeld enhancement : ^ _ = s__. 3 .",
    "_ galactic halo_. as for recombination epoch , the dominant term is the sommerfeld one . in our galaxy",
    "the velocity of the dm particles is supposed to be of the order of ( @xmath39 , which implies @xmath40 . in the galaxy",
    "the velocity regime is : |_z=0 = _ ~510 ^ -4c with an annihilating cross section : ^ _ = s__.    if we take into account that the current value of @xmath8 in our galaxy does not completely saturate the sommerfeld effect , a conservative numerical factor @xmath41 can be assumed for the ratio @xmath42 between the enhancement at recombination and the one today ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : crosssection ] ) .",
    "the relation between the galactic annihilation cross section measured by ams-02 and the one measured by planck at the recombination can be written as : [ eqn : crosssection ] ^_(12)^_.",
    "the cmb experiments can constrain the dm annihilation cross section from the quantity introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite : p_f _ as a function of the factor @xmath43 that encodes the efficiency of the energy absorption at the recombination .",
    "therfore , another parameter has to be taken into account for the comparison between cr and cmb experiments . in principle @xmath44 , but it has been demonstrated that this can be taken as a constant at @xmath45 @xcite , around the recombination epoch ; it lies in the theoretical range between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with recombination values generally chosen between @xmath48 and @xmath49 as a function of the annihilation channel ( see refs .",

    "[ fig : planckannihilation ] it can be noted that , for a tev - ish particle , _",
    "e.g. _ with a mass of @xmath69 , and a _",

    "consequently , constraints of the order of @xmath77 for a heavy dm candidate can be still in agreement with the boosted cross sections which are necessary to reproduce cr positrons excess @xcite ; as a first step , only resonant sommerfeld boosts , that induce an overall enhancement @xmath78 w.r.t @xmath79 , can be for certain excluded .",

    "in addition , the greater the mass , the greater the uncertainty of the annihilation scheme and the greater the degrees of freedom to tune the annihilation chain and fit the data .",
    "+ it must be stressed that all recent observations point toward a tev - ish paradigm and suggest to look above @xmath51 for wimp dm masses @xcite ; at the same time too high dm masses @xmath125 could introduce some conflicts and could be not too suitable to fit the ams-02 2014 positron fraction and its supposed flattening , due to the achievement of a maximum of the positron production .",
    "it is more advisable to avoid the @xmath126 annihilation scenarios associated to very high masses and too high annihilation cross sections @xcite .",
    "+ the previous fits have one order of magnitude of span in the annihilation cross section ; the ensemble of the fits prescriptions could be approximately described as a rectangle in the @xmath127 plane : @xmath128 .",
    "this must be translated in the @xmath129 plane : if we take @xmath130 , the most general permitted window becomes @xmath131 .",
    "+ but such a rectangle is very loose and it is based on standard assumptions which can be easily extended .",
    "in fact the constraints from ams-02 positron data greatly relax introducing a dark disk ( dd ) in addition to a dark halo : this ensures dynamical enhancements of the dm annihilation cross section within the high density dd , @xmath132 , without the need of @xmath133 , @xcite . for indirect detection ,",
    "the dd scenario could easily accommodate a large boost factor from local density enhancement in the range @xmath134 , depending on the disk height .",
    "+ in addition , the constraints become less stringent if one consider both dm and pulsars as sources of primary positrons @xcite .",
    "pulsars and dd hypothesis can only relax the dm bounds , enlarging the allowed region in the @xmath129 plane .",
    "+ for what concerns the uncertainties which afflict cr propagation physics , we still do not have a complete and well - posed understanding of the cr lepton problematic : non - standard propagation models may be introduced to account for part or all of the positrons measured in space @xcite ) .",
    "hence the constraints obtained from the positron sector ( positron spectrum and positron fraction ) strongly depend on the underlying cr propagation model and certainly on the ams-02 measurements errors .",
    "thanks to ams-02 unprecedented precision it will be soon possible to fix an almost univocal scheme of propagation of cosmic rays in our galaxy , allowing to correctly compute the effective background for dm indirect searches : in fact , tiny variations of the most significant parameters , such as the diffusive halo thickness , the diffusion coefficient and exponent and the electrons spectral indices , may lead to misleading interpretations of ams-02 data , pointing to an incorrect scenario . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pppc4 ] a qualitative illustration of propagation and measurement uncertainties , performed with pppc4dmid @xcite , show how unstable these fits are : a best - fit point in the @xmath127 plain carries up to 50% uncertainty in the choice of the annihilation cross section and dm mass values .     and a set with about half the annihilation cross section ( blue curve ) and the ratio between a reference positron fit with @xmath87 and one with @xmath135 ( purple curve ) .",
    "as long the two curves lie below the dark yellow line , which represent the combination of the two main uncertainties sources , from cr propagation ( the min - max sets span in @xcite ) and from ams-02 errors , the best - fit point can be adjusted in the @xmath127 plain.,height=226 ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : pppc4 ] one argues that dm fits to ams-02 positrons and positron fraction with standard propagation models , up to @xmath136 , suffer large uncertainties , of the order of @xmath137 , if taken individually .",
    "this is the degree of uncertainty from the most precise space experiment which measures cr fluxes : when a fit on pamela , fermi ( or ams-01 , heat , hess ) data is performed , an uncertainty at least three times the ams-02 ones should be addressed : it could imply almost one order of magnitude in the annihilation cross section and more than @xmath51 for tev - ish dm masses .",
    "+ finally , when exploring the dm @xmath127 space , other underlying parameters are fixed , such as the dark matter halo shape and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to primary positrons from dm annihilation .",
    "the choice of the dm radial profile is not too significant , whereas full calculations of the nlo and nnlo electroweak ( ew ) corrections may modify the primary dm fluxes up to one order of magnitude @xcite , producing more light final states than expected in lo calculations and allowing lower values of the annihilation cross section : they are relevant for spectra predictions especially when @xmath138 is much larger than the ew scale and ew bremsstrahlung is permitted .",
    "we consider the collection of fits discussed in section  [ sec : three ] : applying the constraint @xmath139 , according to the up - to - date calculations derived in @xcite , where @xmath76 is preferred only for the electron channels for non tev - ish dm candidates , an overall cr allowed region is obtained ( fig .",
    "[ fig : planckannihilationrev ] ) , which is something like @xmath140 .",
    "the qualitative fraction of this region permitted by cmb observations is about 9% , 4% and 2% of the total area obtained combining cosmic rays fits , assuming @xmath141 respectively .",
    "+ our analysis is compatible with the one presented in @xcite ; in @xcite the region allowed by planck is @xmath142% .",
    "plane from ams-02/fermi / pamela ( dot - dashed rectangle ) , along with planck 2015 bound ( blue line ) . only a cosmic variance limited ( cvl ) experiment ( black line ) could completely falsify the cr indirect search constraints for tev - ish candidates .",
    "the points corresponding to the best - fits are the ones presented in section  [ sec : three ] for @xmath58 .",
    "the rectangles for @xmath74 ( yellow ) and @xmath143 ( purple ) are also drawn.,width=340 ]     + planck 2015 cmb data appear not to completely exclude annihilating dm as primary source for ams-02 positron excess , regardless the choice of the recombination efficiency value . from fig .",
    "[ fig : planckannihilationrev ] it emerges that future improvement on cmb measurements @xcite could hardly falsify the dark matter interpretation of cosmic - rays antiparticles , for what concerns tev - ish dark matter candidates .",
    "in addition , fundamental uncertainties from cr propagation physics and from dd hypothesis , pulsars contributions and alternative cr propagation models , not reported in fig .  [",
    "fig : planckannihilationrev ] , could almost arbitrarily enlarges the window in the @xmath129 plane , up to @xmath144 particles and down to nearly thermal cross sections .",
    "incoming cr high statistics measurements of leptons and nuclei from ams-02 will allow us to deepen the examination of this important issue , narrowing cr uncertainties and dm properties .",
    "besides that , the information from the antiproton channel is mandatory to put more consistent and coherent constraints on the annihilation capability of the dm candidate , because cr antiprotons have less important backgrounds @xcite , so granting more precise estimations .",
