    "in circuit quantum electrodynamics , the controllable interaction of circuit elements is a highly desirable resource for quantum computation and quantum simulation experiments .",
    "the most common method is a static capacitive or inductive coupling between cavities and/or qubits .",
    "in such a system , photon exchange can be controlled by either tuning the circuit elements in and out of resonance or using sideband transitions.@xcite while this approach has proven to be useful for few coupled circuit elements , it seems impracticable for larger systems , where it is hard to provide sufficient detunings between all circuit elements .",
    "@xcite therefore , one may alternatively use tunable coupling elements such as qubits @xcite or squids .",
    "@xcite one particular example for an interesting application of such actively coupled circuit elements are quantum simulations of bosonic many - body hamiltonians.@xcite in such a scenario , the bosonic degrees of freedom can be represented by networks of ( possibly nonlinear ) superconducting resonators . for this quantum simulator",
    ", a tunable coupler would constitute an important control knob .",
    "a more general scope of this device is the controllable routing of photonic states on a chip , which is interesting for quantum information as well as quantum simulation experiments .",
    "+ in this work , we experimentally investigate the case of two nearly frequency - degenerate superconducting transmission line resonators coupled by an rf  squid in the spirit of refs .",
    "the rf  squid , a superconducting loop intersected by a single josephson junction , acts as a flux - tunable mutual inductance , mediating a flux tunable coupling between the two resonators . tuning the rf  squid by an external flux",
    ", we can vary the coupling strength between @xmath1 and @xmath4 and observe the corresponding coupled modes in our system .",
    "furthermore , we find that the coupling can be suppressed by approximately four orders of magnitude and , therefore , efficiently be switched off .",
    "finally , the flux - tunable inductance provided by the rf  squid gives access to parametric amplification with gains of up to .",
    "our results are particularly relevant for the realization of scalable arrays of superconducting resonators for quantum information processing and quantum simulation applications . in this context",
    ", we emphasize that the rf  squid coupler requires only a single josephson junction and a single control field per coupler .",
    "an optical micrograph of the sample is shown in fig .  [",
    "wulschner_fig1](a ) . our system is comprised of an rf  squid galvanically coupled to the center conductor of two coplanar stripline resonators .",
    "these resonators , a and b , can be described as quantum harmonic oscillators using the hamiltonian    @xmath5    here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the resonance frequencies and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the effect of the rf  squid on the system properties can be modeled in terms of an effective inductance.@xcite the fluxes @xmath12 and @xmath13 generated by the resonators in the rf  squid give rise to an inductive interaction energy .",
    "the rf  squid consists of a superconducting loop with inductance @xmath14 , which is interrupted by a josephson junction with critical current @xmath15 . the flux @xmath16 threading the squid loop gives rise to a circulating current @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the flux quantum .",
    "here , @xmath16 is the sum of the externally applied flux @xmath19 and the flux generated by @xmath20 , @xmath21    since , in the experiment , the screening parameter @xmath22 , the dependence of the total flux on the external flux is single - valued . from eq .",

    "( [ hint ] ) as described in ref .",
    ", two essential properties of the system become obvious .",
    "first , the @xmath25-terms in eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) lead to dressed resonator frequencies    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the inductance of the resonators and @xmath28 the inductance of the segment shared between resonator and rf  squid .",
    "the second effect of eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) , caused by term @xmath29 , is a flux dependent coupling    @xmath30    between the resonators . due to their vicinity on the chip ,",
    "there is a also flux independent direct inductive coupling component @xmath31 between the resonators .",
    "thus the total coupling reads    @xmath32    equation  ( [ lrf ] ) shows that @xmath33 can be positive or negative depending on the applied flux . by applying a suitable flux ,",
    "the rf  squid mediated coupling compensates the direct inductive coupling . in this way one can turn on and off the net coupling between the resonators . after a rotating wave approximation",
    "the full hamiltonian reads @xmath34    the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ fullhamiltonian ] ) correspond to the new eigenfrequencies @xmath35",
    "figure  [ wulschner_fig1](a ) shows the layout of the sample chip . in the resonator design ,",
    "we omit the second groundplane to reduce the direct geometric coupling between the two resonators .",
    "the rf  squid is galvanically connected to both center strips of the resonators over a length of @xmath36 .",
    "the sample is fabricated as follows .",
    "first , a @xmath37 thick niobium layer is sputter deposited onto a @xmath38 thick , thermally oxidized silicon wafer .",
    "the resonators and the squid loop are patterned using optical lithography and reactive ion etching .",
    "the josephson junction of the squid is fabricated in a @xmath39 trilayer process .",
    "the resonators have a characteristic impedance of @xmath40 and the resonance frequencies @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the squid loop has dimensions of @xmath43 and a screening parameter @xmath44 to maximize the coupling according to eq .",
    "( [ lrf ] ) while keeping the squid monostable .",
    "the sample is mounted inside a gold plated copper box , which is attached to the base temperature stage of a dilution refrigerator operating at @xmath45 .",
    "a superconducting solenoid attached to the top of the sample box is used to generate the external flux applied to the rf  squid . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ wulschner_fig1](b ) , one port of each resonator is connected to an attenuated input microwave line , whereas the remaining ports are connected to output lines containing microwave amplifiers .",
    "we first extract the properties of the rf  squid coupler from transmission measurements through the individual resonators . as indicated in fig .  1",
    ", we call this type of measurement a `` through - measurement '' .",
    "in contrast , in the `` cross - measurements '' we inject a signal into one of the resonators and probe the output of the other one . in these measurements",
    ", the applied microwave power corresponds to an average photon number of about one in the resonators . in fig .",
    "[ eigenmodes](a ) and fig .",
    "[ eigenmodes](b ) , the through measurements of resonator a and b are shown depending on the applied flux @xmath19 . according to eq .",
    "( [ lrf ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) , the modulation of the resonator modes due to the presence of the rf  squid is @xmath18-periodic and symmetric with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "the two modes of eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalues ] ) manifest themselves as two resonances in the spectroscopy data .",
    "as expected , we observe a flux dependent mode distance , caused by the flux tunable mutual inductance of the rf  squid . for most flux values ,",
    "one observes two resonance peaks independent of the chosen input and output port .",
    "however near @xmath47 and @xmath48 , only a single peak is present in the through measurements and cross transmission is strongly suppressed ( see fig .",
    "[ crossmeasurment ] ) .",
    "these are the points where the squid - mediated coupling compensates the direct inductive coupling resulting in a vanishing total coupling and , hence , completely decoupled resonators .",
    "note that for @xmath49 , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ fullhamiltonian ] ) becomes diagonal and each of the two modes reflects the excitation of one of the resonators . in fig .",

    "the resonators decouple and signal transmission is blocked .",
    "the red arrows mark the flux values , for which transmission vs. frequency cuts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fluxcuts].,scaledwidth=40.0% ]        upon closer inspection , we find a minimum distance on the order of @xmath52 between these modes .",
    "this finite gap is caused by a small detuning @xmath53 of the resonators .",
    "we also observe different decay rates of the resonators , which we extract from the through measurements of both resonators at a decoupling point .",
    "lorentzian fits lead to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the fact that resonator a has smaller width at half maximum and a and a slightly higher eigenfrequency than resonator b , indicates a smaller effective coupling capacitance,@xcite which we attribute to fabrication or sample contacting imperfections .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , we define the fitting parameter @xmath57 . in this way",
    ", the rf  squid coupling reads @xmath58 . fitting the data , we obtain @xmath59 and @xmath60 . from the mode distance",
    "we find @xmath61 ranging between @xmath62 and @xmath63 . beyond this value ,",
    "the lower mode becomes too broad due to its steep flux dependence .",
    "+ next , we analyze the properties of our device in the coupled and decoupled state in more detail . because of the small detuning of the resonators , the coupled modes are not necessarily symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the uncoupled modes .",
    "this is also seen in the spectroscopy of the single resonators ( seefig .",
    "[ eigenmodes ] ) , where the modes have different intensities .",
    "the mode mixing can be estimated from the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ fullhamiltonian ] ) . for @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "we obtain the mixing ratios 63:37 and 52:48 , respectively .",
    "hence , in the latter case , our sample satisfies the condition @xmath66 , where the detuning becomes insignificant . in the decoupled case near @xmath67 and @xmath51 , the off - diagonal elements in the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ fullhamiltonian ] ) vanish and the modes are pure excitations of resonator a or b. + in this situation , it is particularly instructive to examine the cross - transmission spectra such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ crossmeasurment ] , where resonator a is driven and resonator b is probed . here , we clearly see that in two narrow regions around @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where the net coupling @xmath70 approaches zero , the microwave transmission between the resonators is blocked .",
    "we gain further insight by comparing the through- and cross - transmission spectra in fig .",
    "[ fluxcuts](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fluxcuts](b ) . for @xmath71",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fluxcuts](a ) ] , both measurements exhibit similar peak heights .",
    "since both measurements use the same output line , we relate the small difference of approximately mainly to the slightly different losses in the input lines . for @xmath72 , however , the cross - transmission is suppressed by on resonance as shown in fig .",
    "[ fluxcuts](b ) , corresponding to a relative transmission change of .",
    "this result confirms that we can sufficiently compensate the direct inductive coupling with the tunable squid - mediated coupling . finally , in fig .  [ fluxcuts](c )",
    "we show the transmission for a flux value , where @xmath70 and @xmath73 are comparable . in the through measurement , the detuning manifests itself in the form of unequal peak heights and an anti - resonance dip , which is not centered between the resonance peaks.@xcite",
    "so far , we have treated the rf  squid as a flux - tunable coupler between the two resonators .",
    "however , we can also interpret it as a flux - tunable inductance , parametrically modifying the eigenfrequency of the modes .",
    "then , a harmonic flux drive applied in addition to the static flux allows for the study of parametric effects .",
    "our experiments in this direction are inspired by analog experiments on josephson parametric amplifier @xcite and converter.@xcite in order to operate our device as a flux - driven amplifier , we apply an additional drive tone at @xmath74 to the input line .",
    "the drive tone periodically modulates the flux threading the squid loop and therefore the mode frequency , leading to parametric amplification . to characterize the performance of the resulting parametric amplifier , we calculate the power gain ( g ) as well as the bandwidth characterized by the full width half maximum @xmath75 of the amplified signals .",
    "figure  [ paramp ] shows the transmission in the vicinity of @xmath76 and @xmath77 for different values of the drive power .",
    "while the gain is increasing for higher drive strength , the bandwidth decreases as expected . for a nondegenerate ( phase - insensitive ) gain of @xmath78 ,",
    "the gain - bandwidth product is @xmath79 .",
    "checking the theoretical relation@xcite @xmath80 , we find a maximum deviation of 2.5 similar to other experiments.@xcite     for @xmath77 with an additional drive tone @xmath81 for different drive powers @xmath82 .",
    "the drive power refers to the power at sample input.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "in conclusion , we present a flux - tunable coupling between two superconducting resonators based on an rf  squid .",
    "spectroscopically , we measure negative and positive couplings ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the observed suppression of the cross - transmission of up to @xmath83 proves the ability to effectively turn off the coupling and is a significant improvement compared to previous work.@xcite with this performance , our coupler is considered a useful tool both for quantum computation , where a controlled nearest neighbor interaction is required and our coupler could be used to route information in a controllable way on a chip and for quantum simulation experiments,@xcite where it could be useful not only to change the amplitude of the coupling constant but also its sign.@xcite finally , we investigate parametric amplification of the device and observe a nondegenerate gain as large as @xmath84 .",
