    "recently recommender systems is one of the most popular subareas of machine learning .",
    "in fact , the recommender algorithms based on matrix factorisation techniques ( mf ) has become industry standard .    among the",
    "most frequently used types of matrix factorisation we definitely should mention singular value decomposition ( svd ) @xcite and its various modifications like probabilistic latent semantic analysis ( plsa ) @xcite .",
    "however , the existing similar techniques , for example , non - negative matrix factorisation ( nmf ) @xcite and boolean matrix factorisation ( bmf ) @xcite , seem to be less studied .",
    "an approach similar to matrix factorization is biclustering which was also successfully applied in recommender system domain @xcite . for example , formal concept analysis @xcite can also be used as a biclustering technique and there are some of its applications in recommenders algorithms @xcite .    is to compare recommendation quality of some of the aforementioned techniques on real datasets and try to investigate the methods interrelationship .",
    "it is especially interesting to conduct experiments on comparison of recommendations quality in case of an input matrix with numeric values and in case of a boolean matrix in terms of precision and recall as well as mae .",
    "moreover , one of the useful properties of matrix factorisation is its ability to keep reliable recommendation quality even in case of dropping some insufficient factors . for bmf",
    "this issue is experimentally investigated in section [ exp ] .    of the paper",
    "is defined by the fact that it is a first time when bmf based on formal concept analysis @xcite is investigated in the context of recommender systems .    of the paper",
    "is determined by demands of the recommender systems industry , that is to gain reliable quality in terms of mean average error ( mae ) , precision and recall as well as time performance of the investigated method .",
    "the rest of the paper consists of five sections .",
    "the second section is an introductory review of the existing mf - based recommender approaches . in the third section",
    "we describe our recommender algorithm which is based on boolean matrix factorisation using closed sets of users and items ( that is fca ) .",
    "section 4 contains methodology of our experiments and results of experimental comparison of different mf - based recommender algorithms by means of cross - validation in terms of mae , precision and recall .",
    "the last section concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we briefly describe different approaches to the decomposition of both real - valued and boolean matrices . among the methods of the svd group we describe only svd .",
    "we also discuss nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf ) and boolean matrix factorization ( bmf ) .",
    "singular value decomposition ( svd ) is a decomposition of a rectangular matrix @xmath0 into the product of three matrices    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are orthogonal matrices , and @xmath4 is a diagonal matrix such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the columns of the matrix @xmath7 and @xmath8 are called singular vectors , and the numbers @xmath9 are singular values @xcite .    in the context of recommendation systems rows of @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "can be interpreted as vectors of the user s and items s loyalty ( attitude ) to a certain topic ( factor ) , and the corresponding singular values as the importance of the topic among the others .",
    "the main disadvantage is in the fact that the matrix may contain both positive and negative numbers ; the last ones are difficult to interpret .",
    "the advantage of svd for recommendation systems is that this method allows to obtain the vector of its loyalty to certain topics for a new user without svd decomposition of the whole matrix .",
    "the evaluation of computational complexity of svd according to @xcite is @xmath12 floating - point operations if @xmath13 or more precisely @xmath14 .",
    "consider as an example the following table of movie ratings :    .movie rates [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the main purpose of matrix factorisation is a reduction of matrices dimensionality . as a result",
    "some part of the original data remains uncovered , so it was interesting to explore how the quality of recommendations changes based on different factorisations , depending on the proportion of the data covered by factors .",
    "two methods of matrix factorisation were considered : bmf and svd .",
    "the fraction of data covered by factors for svd was calculated as @xmath15 and for bmf as @xmath16 to quality assessment we chose @xmath17 .",
    "+     +    fig .",
    "[ svd ] shows that @xmath18 , calculated for the model based on @xmath19 of factors , is not very different from @xmath20 , calculated for the model built for @xmath21 factors . at the same time , for the recommendations based on a boolean factorization covering @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the data respectively , it is clear that increasing the number of factors improves mae , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bmf ] .",
    "@xmath24 & 2,4604 & 1.4355 & 1.1479 & 0.9750 & 0.9148 & 0.8652 & 0.8534 + @xmath25 & 2.4813 & 1.3960 & 1.1215 & 0.9624 & 0.9093 & 0.8650 & 0.8552 + @xmath26 & 2.3091 & 1.3185 & 1.0744 & 0.9350 & 0.8864 & 0.8509 & 0.8410 +    table [ tbl - maecov ] shows that the mae for recommendations built on a boolean factorisation covering 80 % of the data for the number of neighbors less than 50 is better than the mae for recommendations built on svd factorization .",
    "it is also easy to see that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are different from @xmath29 in no more than @xmath30 .      besides comparison of algorithms using mae other evaluation metrics",
    "can also be exploited , for example    @xmath31    @xmath32    and    @xmath33    it is widely spread belief that the larger recall , precision and f1 are , the better is recommendation algorithm .    figures [ recall ] , [ precision ] and [ f1 ] show the dependence of relevant evaluation metrics on the percentage of the data covered by bmf - decomposition , and the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "the number of objects to recommend was chosen to be 20 .",
    "the figures show that the recommendation based on the boolean decomposition , is worse than recommendations built on the full matrix of ratings .",
    "+     +     +      another thing that was interesting to examine was the impact of scaling described in [ shkal ] on the quality of recommendations .",
    "four options of scaling were considered :    1 .",
    "@xmath34 if @xmath35 , else @xmath36 ( user rates an item ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath37 if @xmath38 else @xmath39 3 .",
    "@xmath40 if @xmath41 else @xmath36 .",
    "4 .   @xmath42 if @xmath43 , else @xmath39    the distribution of ratings in data is on figure  [ circle ]     +    for each of the boolean matrices we calculate its boolean factorisation , covering 60 % and 80 % of the data .",
    "then recommendations are calculated just like in [ svd - bmf ] .",
    "it can be seen that for both types of data coverage @xmath44 is almost the same as @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is better than @xmath45 .",
    "[ mae_shkal_60 ]     [ mae_shkal_80 ]      besides the ability to search for @xmath47 nearest neighbors not in the full matrix of ratings @xmath48 , but in the matrix @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a number of users , and @xmath51 is a number of factors , boolean matrix factorization can be used to data filtering .",
    "because the algorithm returns as an output not only matrices users - factors and factors - objects , but also the ratings that were not used for factoring , we can try to search for users , similar to the user , on the matrix consisting only of ratings used for the factorization .    just as before to find the nearest neighbors cosine measure is used , and the predicted ratings are calculated as the weighted sum of the ratings of nearest users .",
    "figure  [ mae_filtr_all ] shows that the smaller the data we use for filtering the bigger is mae .",
    "figure  [ mae_filtr_bmf ] shows that the recommendations built on user - factor matrix , are better then recommendations , constructed on matrix of ratings filtered with boolean factorization .",
    "in the paper we considered main methods of matrix factorisation which are suitable for recommender systems . some of these methods were compared on real datasets .",
    "we investigated bmf behaviour as part of recommender algorithm .",
    "we also conducted several experiments on recommender quality comparison with numeric matrices , user - factor and factor - item matrices in terms of recall , precision and mae .",
    "we showed that mae of our bmf - based approach is not greater than mae of svd - based approach for the same number of factors on the real data . for methods that require the number of factors as an initial parameter in the user or item profile ( e.g. , nmf ) , we proposed the way of finding this number with fca - based bmf .",
    "we also have investigated how data filtering , namely scaling , influences on recommendations quality .    as a further research direction we would like to investigate the proposed approaches in case of graded and triadic data @xcite and reveal whether there are some benefits for the algorithm s quality in usage least - squares data imputation techniques @xcite . in the context of matrix factorisation we also would like to test our approach on the quality assessment of recommender algorithms that we performed on some basic algorithms ( see bimodal cross - validation in @xcite ) .",
