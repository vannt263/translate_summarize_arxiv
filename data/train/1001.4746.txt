    "during the last decade the idea to study electromagnetic particle production at hadron and heavy - ion colliders has developed theoretically as well as experimentally . at the previous conference in this series ( photon 07 , held at the sorbonne in paris ) ,",
    "a session was devoted to this topic .",
    "i gave a summary of photoproducion at hadron colliders , in particular in heavy - ion collisions , at that meeting@xcite .",
    "since then , several new results have been published and an update of the latest development will be given here .",
    "more comprehensive reviews of the field can be found e.g. in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons to study photon - induced reactions in collisions between hadrons . at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , the accessible two - photon center of mass energies will be much higher than at lep and the photon - nucleon energies will be higher than at hera .",
    "the lhc will thus explore a new and uncharted territory also in interactions mediated by photons .",
    "heavy - ion interactions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider and at the lhc provide an opportunity to study photons from strong electromagnetic fields where the coupling is @xmath0 rather than @xmath1 . at a hadron collider both projectiles can act as photon emitter and target , and this leads to some interesting interference phenomena , which will be discussed below .",
    "furthermore , the electromagnetic contribution is important for understanding other types of exclusive particle production , e.g. through pomeron+pomeron interactions in @xmath2 or @xmath3 collisions .",
    "it has been been proposed to use two - photon production of @xmath4pairs as a luminosity monitor at the lhc .    to separate the electromagnetic interactions from the `` background '' of strong , hadronic processes , it is in practice necessary to restrict the study to so - called ultra - peripheral collisions , where the impact parameters are larger than the sum of the beam particle radii .",
    "this means impact parameters in the range @xmath51.4(14 ) - 100  fm in proton - proton ( heavy - ion collisions ) .",
    "the upper range 100 fm is somewhat arbitrary but in practice the fields at current colliders are too weak to produce particles outside this range .",
    "the exception is production of low - mass @xmath6pairs , where impact parameters above 1000  fm can give a significant contribution .",
    "experimentally , interactions mediated by photons can be separated from purely hadronic interactions by their lower multiplicity and the presence of rapidity gaps .",
    "if the entire event is reconstructed , charge conservation and the low total transverse momentum also provide strong background rejection .",
    "ultra - peripheral collisions have been studied at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory by the two large experiments phenix and star .",
    "the first results on @xmath7 photoproduction were published by the star collaboration based on data from the first run at rhic in the year 2000 .",
    "star has so far mainly focussed on low - mass states , such as photoproduction of the @xmath7 meson and low - mass @xmath8pairs .",
    "the study of ultra - peripheral collisions in phenix has been directed towards heavy vector meson production ( j/@xmath9 ) and high - mass @xmath8pairs .",
    "the first preliminary results from phenix were presented at the quark matter 2005 conference@xcite , and earlier this year the final results were published@xcite .",
    "the final results also include cross sections for two - photon production of @xmath6pairs .",

    "the event selection is described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    phenix has implemented a trigger where an energy deposit of @xmath10 gev in the mid - rapidity electromagnetic calorimeters is combined with two rapidity gaps at intermediate rapidities .",
    "the rapidity gaps are defined by an absence of a signal in the cherenkov beam - beam counters ( bbc ) covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath11 on either side of midrapidity .",
    "it is furthermore required that there should be a signal ( @xmath12  gev ) in one or both of the zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc ) situated 18 m downstream from the interaction point .",
    "this requirement means that the central production occurs in coincidence with exchange of one or more additional photons which lead to the break up of one or both nuclei .",
    "a data sample with an integrated luminosity of @xmath13b from the 2004 high - luminosity run at rhic has been analyzed .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to around @xmath14 inelastic au+au events ( @xmath15  b ) .",
    "the upc trigger as described above collected @xmath16 events out of which @xmath17 satisfied standard data quality assurance criteria .",
    "the electrons and positrons were tracked and identified in the phenix central tracking arms , covering @xmath18 and @xmath19 each .",
    "tracking was performed by multi - layer drift chambers and multi - wire proportional chambers in each arm , and electrons were identified by their signals in the ring - imaging - cerenkov ( rich ) detectors and the electromagnetic calorimeters . in the offline analysis",
    ", it was required that the event should contain exactly 2 tracks of opposite charge satisfying the upc electron / positron identification criteria and that the event vertex should be within @xmath20  cm from the center of the detector .",
    "it was required that each electron / positron should have @xmath21  gev to be well above the trigger threshold ( @xmath10  gev ) .",
    "this gave a sample with 28 events , the invariant mass and @xmath22 distributions of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phenix ] .",
    "there was no like - sign background after the offline cuts had been applied .",
    "the results are consistent with production of @xmath6pairs through two - photon interactions , @xmath23 , and photonuclear production ( coherent and incoherent ) of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , followed by the decay @xmath26 .",
    "the background from hadronically produced @xmath6pairs in the ultra - peripheral sample was estimated from measurements of @xmath6pairs in proton - proton collisions and was found to be negligible ( @xmath27  event ) .",

    "the curve shows for comparison the nuclear ( au ) form factor .    the cross section for @xmath24 production ,",
    "@xmath28b with nuclear break up , is consistent with theoretical predictions@xcite , but the size of the experimental errors preclude a discrimination between the models .",
    "the cross section for continuum @xmath6 production are shown in table  [ tab : phenix ] .",
    "the results are in good agreement with calculations using the method of equivalent photons as implemented in the starlight monte carlo@xcite .",
    "the mid - rapidity cross section for @xmath24 is a measure of the @xmath29  nucleon cross section in nuclear matter@xcite and is also affected by nuclear gluon shadowing@xcite .",
    "recent calculations by baltz@xcite for two - photon production of di - muons and di - electrons have found that higher order terms reduce the cross section by 20 - 30% in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "a recent calculation has however not found such large reductions from higher order terms , particularly not for @xmath4pairs@xcite .",

    "two trigger classes were defined .",
    "one class was based on having two roughly back - to - back hits in the central trigger barrel ( ctb ) , a set of 240 scintillators surrounding the tpc .",
    "this trigger ( `` topology trigger '' ) selects photoproduced @xmath7 mesons with and without nuclear break up . the second trigger class ( `` minimum bias ( mb ) '' ) required the events to have a signal in both zdcs , and thus selected photoproduction in coincidence with mutual coulomb breakup of both au - nuclei .",

    "the curves are fits to a function with an interference term.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    both nuclei can act as photon emitter and target in an ultra - peripheral collision .",
    "since the two possibilities can not be distinguished , they might interfer quantum mechanically .",
    "the separation of the two nuclei when a @xmath7 meson is produced at rhic energies is typically 1440 fm , with a different distribution depending on if the @xmath7 is produced with or without nuclear breakup .",
    "the median impact parameters are @xmath38  46  fm for the total production and @xmath38  18  fm with mutual break up@xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 meson is always produced near the surface of one of the nuclei because of the short range of the nuclear force .",
    "the system thus acts as a two - source interferometer and , depending on the separation of the nuclei and the wave length of the @xmath7 , interference might occur .",
    "the interference will be destructive in collisions between particles and constructive in collisions between particles and anti - particles .",
    "for production at mid - rapidity , where the amplitudes for the two possibilities are equal , the cross section for a meson with tranverse momentum @xmath39 in a collision with impact parameter @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the cross section for emission from a single source .",
    "the total production cross section is obtained by integrating over all allowed impact parameters . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the cross section will be affected by the interference .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : interference ] , where the solid curve shows the expected @xmath44 spectrum with interference and the dashed curve shows the expected spectrum without interference . the smaller mean impact parameters in collisions with nuclear break means that the interference extends to higher transverse momenta , as seen in fig .",

    "the presence of interference and its effect on the vector meson transverse momentum spectrum was predicted@xcite .",

    "the measured transverse momentum distributions for the two trigger classes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : star ] . as one moves away from mid - rapidity , the amplitudes for the two target and photon - emitter configurations will be different and one expects the interference to decrease .",
    "this can be seen in the two plots to the right in fig .",
    "[ fig : star ] .",
    "what makes this interference particularly interesting is the fact that the life - time of the @xmath7 is much smaller than the separation between the nuclei divided by the speed of light .",
    "the interference must therefore occur between the decay products of the @xmath7 , which are in an entangled state .",
    "the interference is the result of the large separation between the nuclei in an ultra - peripheral collision and is expected to be different for other coherent production mechanisms , e.g. odderon  pomeron fusion .",
    "two - photon and photonuclear interactions have been studied by the cdf collaboration in proton - anti - proton collisions at the tevatron .",
    "the latest results include exclusive di - muon production in the invariant mass range 3  @xmath45  4 gev@xcite and two - photon production of di - leptons with @xmath46  40 gev@xcite .",
    "the produced particles have been detected at central rapidities , @xmath34  0.6 for intermediate mass di - muons and @xmath34  4 for the high mass di - leptons .",

    "these are combined with the equivalent photon spectrum to give the cross section for @xmath53 , where v is a vector meson .",
    "starlight can also calculate the cross section for @xmath4 pairs produced in two - photon interactions .",
    "the differential cross section , @xmath54 , for vector meson production is given by @xmath55 here , @xmath56 is the photon spectrum and @xmath57 the cross section for @xmath58 .",
    "a @xmath24 produced at central rapidity within @xmath59  0.5 corresponds to photoproduction with photon - proton center of mass energies between @xmath60  gev .",
    "exclusive @xmath24 and @xmath47 production has been studied at hera in this energy range by both the zeus@xcite and h1@xcite collaborations .",
    "the @xmath61 cross sections are thus know experimentally , with errors typically in the range 69 % .",
    "the photon spectrum associated with a relativistic proton can be calculated from that of a point charge modulated by a form factor@xcite .",
    "a problem with this approach is that it does not properly exclude collisions where the protons interact hadronically .",
    "a different approach is therefore used here .",
    "the method is similar to that used for nuclear collisions , where one has to require that the impact parameter be larger than the sum of the nuclear radii to exclude strong interactions@xcite .",
    "the proton has a more diffuse surface , however , so applying a sharp cut - off in impact parameter space is unphysical .",
    "a more realistic approach is to calculate the ( hadronic ) interaction probability as function of impact parameter by applying a fourier transform to the @xmath62 elastic scattering amplitude@xcite . to set a conservative upper limit on the photon spectrum",
    ", it is also calculated with a cut on impact parameter @xmath63  0.7 fm .",
    "this gives a photon spectrum very similar to that obtained when using the proton form factor .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution for the three final states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf ] together with predictions by starlight .",
    "the transverse momenta of the vector mesons reflect the proton form factor and extend out to around @xmath64  gev / c , whereas the transverse momenta of the two - photon final state are considerably lower .",
    "the agreement between data and starlight is very good .    for the calculations of the cross sections ,",
    "the latest results from hera were used to make a new fit to the @xmath65 cross sections .",
    "these fits are slightly different from the ones used earlier@xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the calculated cross sections are determined from the uncertainty in the measured @xmath66 cross sections and the calculation of the photon spectrum with @xmath63  0.7 fm .",
    "the results are @xmath67 these can be compared with the measured values , @xmath68  nb and @xmath69  nb , for the @xmath24 and @xmath47 , respectively@xcite .",
    "the measured cross section for the @xmath24 is thus about two standard deviations above the calculated value and about one standard deviation above the calculated upper limit .",
    "the cdf collaboration has concluded that the upper limit for an odderon contribution ( odderon+pomeron@xmath70 ) is less than @xmath71  2.3 nb with 95% confidence level .",
    "the results from rhic and the tevatron shows the feasibility of studying two - photon and photon - nucleon interactions at hadron colliders .",
    "the results have been found to be in general agreement with predictions , but the statistics at least for heavy final states has so far been rather low",
    ".    the situation should be more advantageous at the lhc for at least two reasons : first , the cross section increases dramatically with the increased collision energy .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] , which shows the excitation function for @xmath24 production at mid - rapidity in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the increase in cross section is about a factor of 100 between rhic and lhc energies .",
    "secondly , the large and versatile experiments at the lhc should have the capability to trigger on and reconstruct particles produced in ultra - peripheral collisions over a wide range of phase space .",
    "several topics can be studied in ultra - peripheral collisions at the lhc .",
    "the cms collaboration has for example investigated the possibilities for studying exclusive @xmath72 production in pb+pb collisions@xcite and two - photon production of supersymmetric pairs in pp collisions@xcite .",
    "alice , which is primarily aimed for studying heavy - ion collisions , has performed simulations of @xmath24 and two - photon production in heavy - ion and proton - proton collisions@xcite .",
    "most studies so far , both at the existing colliders rhic and the tevatron as well as at the lhc , have focussed on exclusive production of a single particle or pair of particles .",
    "it should however be possible to extract as much information from inclusive processes , for example heavy quark production from photon - gluon fusion and photon - induced jet production .    to summarize , ultra - peripheral collisions are an interesting enhancement of the physics programs at hadron colliders",
    ". they can be studied at existing and planned experiments with no or only minor modifications .",
    "the results from rhic and the tevatron have followed the theoretical expectations .",
    "further studies at the lhc and at existing accelerators with increased luminosities will hopefully lead to useful constraints on e.g. the parton density distributions and possibly even the discovery of new phenomena .",
