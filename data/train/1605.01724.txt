    "the nature of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) that reside in inactive galaxy nuclei is very difficult to explore , compared with those of accreting ones observed as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "however , when the orbital path of a star is close enough to a smbh to be disrupted by the tidal force exceeding the self - gravity of the star , a luminous flare in the uv / x - ray bands is predicted @xcite .",
    "this is called a tidal disruption event ( tde ) .",
    "observations of tdes are important to take a census of dormant smbhs and to investigate their environments .",
    "moreover , thanks to their large luminosities , tdes provide us with valuable opportunities to study distant `` inactive '' galactic nuclei .",
    "x - ray surveys covering a large sky area are very useful to detect tdes , because we can not predict when and where an event occurs .",
    "the identifications of tdes were mainly based on their variability characteristics , such as a large amplitude and the unique decline law of the light curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which are supported by both analytic solutions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the recent hard x - ray survey with _",
    "swift_/bat and subsequent x - ray observations detected three tdes accompanied by relativistic jets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "presence of the jets was suggested also from follow - up observations in the radio band @xcite . in these tdes ,",
    "the x - ray fluxes were dominated by non - thermal emission in the beamed jets , unlike in `` classical '' tdes , where one observes blackbody radiation emitted from the stellar debris accreted onto the smbh .",
    "thus , it is interesting to explore what fraction of tdes produces relativistic jets and what the physical mechanism to launch the jets is .    theoretically , the occurrence rate of tdes is estimated to be @xmath4@xmath5 galaxy@xmath6 yr@xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and its dependence on smbh mass is calculated ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , many observational results ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are in rough agreements with the predicted tde rate .",
    "an important quantity that describes the statistical properties of tdes is the `` luminosity function '' , i.e. , the luminosity dependence of the tde rate .",
    "the luminosity function of tdes is highly useful in evaluating the effect of tdes on the growth history of smbhs and in predicting the number of detectable events in future surveys . considering that the flare luminosity of a tde depends on the smbh mass ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is possible theoretically to estimate the luminosity function of tdes @xcite .",
    "however , observational studies that directly constrain the tde luminosity function based on a statistically complete sample have been highly limited so far .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the x - ray luminosity function of tdes , using a statistically complete sample obtained with the monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( _ maxi _ ) mission . for this purpose",
    ", we systematically search for hard x - ray transient events at high galactic latitudes @xmath7 , and identify tdes .",
    "we then derive the luminosity functions of tdes associated with and without relativistic jets individually .",
    "this result also enables us to estimate the contribution of tdes to the growth of smbhs .",

    "maxi _ achieves the highest sensitivity as an all - sky monitor , and is highly useful to detect x - ray transient events , including tdes .",
    "it carries two types of cameras , the gas slit cameras ( gscs ; @xcite ) , consisting of 12 counters , and the solid - state slit camera @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we only utilize the data of the gscs , which covers the energy band of 230 kev .",
    "the gscs have two instantaneous fields - of - view of 1@xmath14.5@xmath15160@xmath14 separated by 90 degrees .",
    "they rotate with a period of 92 minutes according to the orbital motion of the iss , and eventually covers a large fraction of the sky ( 95% ) in one day @xcite .    to search the _ maxi_/gsc data for transient events ,",
    "we analyze those taken in the first 37 months since the beginning of the operation ( from 2009 september 23 to 2012 october 15 ) .",
    "we also restrict our analysis to high galactic latitudes ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "exactly the same data were analyzed to produce the second _ maxi_/gsc catalog @xcite , which contains 500 sources detected in the 410 kev band from the data integrated over the whole period .",
    "the details of the data selection criteria are described in section  2 of @xcite .",
    "tdes are transient events that become bright for a typical time scale of months to years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , they may be missed with the _ maxi _ alert system @xcite , which is currently optimized to detect variability of sources on time scales from hours to a few days .",
    "also , faint tdes may not be detected in the 2nd _ maxi _ catalog @xcite , because the long integration time of 37 months works to smear the signals , making the time averaged significance lower than the threshold .",
    "to detect such transient events as completely as possible , we newly construct the _",
    "maxi_/gsc `` _ transient source catalog _ '' based on the same data as used by @xcite .",
    "the analysis is optimized to find variable objects on the time scale of 30 or 90 days .",
    "namely , we split the whole data into 30 or 90 day bins , and independently perform source detection from each dataset to search for new sources that are not listed in the 2nd _ maxi _ catalog @xcite . as a result",
    ", we detect 10 transient sources with the detection significance @xmath17 in either of the time - sliced datasets , where @xmath18 is defined as ( best - fit flux in 4 - 10 kev ) / ( its 1@xmath19 statistical error ) .",
    "the details of the analysis procedure and the resultant light curves of the transient sources are given in appendix  [ app : sec : ta_search ] .",

    "this object is significantly detected in the data of 30 days during the outburst ( left panel ) , while it is not in the 37-month data ( right panel ) .",
    "we estimate the sensitivity limit for the peak flux averaged for 30 days is @xmath20 mcrab .         on the basis of positional coincidence",

    "hence , we search for other possible tdes that are not reported in the literature from these _ maxi _ catalogs .",
    "we make use of the general characteristics of the light curve pattern of tdes .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ intro ] , a tde shows a rapid flux increase followed by a power - law decay with an index of -5/3 as a function of time ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for this purpose",
    ", we make the light curves of all sources in the 2nd _ maxi_/gsc catalog @xcite and in the transient catalog ( appendix  [ app : sec : ta_search ] ) in 10 days , 30 days , and 90 days bins , in three energy bands , 34 kev , 410 kev , and 310 kev .",
    "the fluxes in each time bin are obtained by the same image fitting method as described in appendix  [ app : sec : ta_search ] by fixing the source positions .",
    "we discard the data when the photon statistics is too poor within each bin ( see subsection 2.1 in @xcite for details ) . using the light curve of crab nebula analyzed in the same way",
    ", we estimate a systematic uncertainty in the flux is @xmath3710% , which is added to the statistical error .    as the reference",
    ", we analyze the light - curve pattern of the four identified tdes , _ swift _ j1112 - 82 , _ swift _ j1644 + 57 , _ swift _ j2058 + 05 , and ngc 4845 .",
    "we find that all of them show the following two characteristics .",
    "the first one is high variability amplitudes ; the ratio between the highest flux and the one of the previous bin in the 30-day ( 90-day ) averaged light curves is 7.0 ( 1.6 ) , 16.3 ( 7.7 ) , 8.2 ( 2.4 ) , and 1.4 ( 6.8 ) for _ swift _ j1112 - 82 , _ swift _ j1644 + 57 , _ swift _ j2058 + 05 , and ngc 4845 , respectively . here , we assign a flux of 5@xmath38 erg s@xmath6 @xmath39 ( 410 kev ) for each bin when the source is undetected , which is the sensitivity limit of the 2nd _ maxi _ catalog @xcite .",
    "the second characteristic is that the decay light curves are consistent with a power - law profile of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is time since the onset time of each tde .",
    "we note that the time of the flux peak , @xmath42 , is delayed from the tde onset time by approximately 80 days for ngc 4845 , 20 days for _ swift _ j1644 + 57 and _ swift _",
    "j2058 + 05 , and 5 days for _ swift _ j1112 - 82 . hence , we set the central day of the bin showing the highest flux as @xmath42 , and estimate the tde onset time by correcting for these offsets .",
    "we confirm that the 10-days light curves in the 310 kev band follow power - law profiles , as shown in figure  [ tde_lc ] .",
    "a power - law fit to the light curve over 90 days after the peak flux is found to be acceptable in terms of a @xmath43 test , yielding the best - fit index of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for _ swift _ j1112 - 82 , _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 57 , _ swift _",
    "j2058 + 05 , and ngc 4845 , respectively .",
    "the errors denote statistical ones at 90% confidence limits , and they are all consistent with @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , we apply the above two conditions to the light curves of all _ maxi _ sources ( in total 506 ) except for the four tdes .",
    "first , we find 12 ( 12 ) objects satisfy the criterion that the ratio between the highest and second highest flux bins is larger than 5 in the 30 ( 90 ) day light curve .",
    "for these candidates , we then perform the same light - curve fitting with a power - law profile as described above . the time delay from the tde onset to the observed flux peak",
    "is set to be either 5 days , 20 days , or 80 days . as a result",
    ", we find that none of them show a decaying index consistent with @xmath0 except for the objects identified as agns or x - ray galactic sources .",
    "thus , we conclude that _ maxi _ detected only the four tdes identified above during the first 37 months of its operation , which can be regarded as a statistically complete sample at the sensitivity limit of _ maxi _ for transient events , _ as long as tdes share similar characteristics in the x - ray light curve to those of the known events .",
    "_    the continuous monitoring data of _ maxi _ provide us with unique information on the x - ray light curve of tdes in the 310 kev band , which can be compared with those obtained with _",
    "swift_/bat in the 14195 kev band .",
    "figure  [ tde_lc_2 ] plots the _ maxi _ light curves in 1-day bins of the three tdes except for ngc 4845 , which was too faint to be examined on shorter time scales than 10 days .",
    "we find that the luminosity peaked at mjd = 55729 , mjd = 55649 , and mjd = 55701 for _ swift _ j111282 , _ swift _",
    "j2058 + 05 , and _ swift",
    "_ j1644 + 57 , respectively , which are all consistent with those determined with _ swift_/bat within 1 day ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , there is no evidence for significant ( @xmath48 day ) time lags between the soft ( @xmath49 kev ) and hard ( @xmath50 kev ) bands .",
    "in this section , we summarize the definitions of tde luminosities used in our analysis ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) . to make luminosity conversion between different energy bands , we need to assume model spectra of tdes . according to the previous studies on tdes observed in the x - ray band ( e.g. , @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) , we can approximate that the x - ray spectra of tdes without jets are composed of blackbody radiation and a power law , which originate from the optically thick disk and its comptonized component by hot corona , respectively . for tdes with jets ,",
    "a relativistically beamed power law is added to the above spectrum .",

    "it can be converted into the `` observed '' peak luminosity by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 or @xmath59 ; see below ) is the conversion factor that depends on the shape of the spectrum , redshift , and viewing angle with respect to the jet axis ( for tdes with jets ) .    introducing the fraction of tdes with jets in total tdes , @xmath60",
    ", we divide tdes into two types , one with jets and the other without jets . for the tdes without jets ,",
    "whose fraction is @xmath61 , the conversion factor @xmath58 can be written as    @xmath62    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are those for the comptonized ( power - law ) and blackbody components , respectively .",
    "we normalize @xmath63 to unity when @xmath52 of a tde at @xmath65 is defined in the 410 kev band and its spectrum is not absorbed .",
    "the factor @xmath64 depends on the broadband spectrum of a tde , as detailed in the third paragraph of section [ sec : comp_rosat ] .",
    "note that the blackbody component is negligible in the 410 kev band because its temperature is expected to be much lower than a few kev ( section  [ sec : comp_rosat ] ) .    for tdes with relativistic jets",
    ", the conversion factor @xmath59 can be written as    @xmath66    where the last term represents the jet contribution .",
    "here , @xmath67 takes account of the energy - band conversion , @xmath68 is the fraction of the intrinsic luminosity ( i.e. , that would be observed without beaming ) of the jet in @xmath53   ( the peak luminosity of the comptonized component ) , and @xmath33 is the doppler factor .",
    "it is represented as @xmath69 where @xmath32 is the lorentz factor and @xmath70 is the viewing angle with respect to the jet axis .",
    "the observed luminosity from the jet becomes larger than the intrinsic one by a factor of @xmath71 with a frequency shift by @xmath33 . in our analysis , we adopt @xmath72 , which is suggested from the analysis of the spectrum energy distribution of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 by @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath70 can be estimated if @xmath33 is constrained from the observations , as listed in table  [ tde_sample ] for _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 57 .",
    "we also adopt @xmath73 as a standard value .",
    "it is confirmed that our main results do not sensitively depend on the choice of @xmath32 or @xmath68 ( see section  [ sec : eff_par ] ) .",
    "k. the three components are shown ( red : jet component with @xmath74 , blue : comptonized component , magenta : blackbody component ) .",
    "the unit of the vertical axis is arbitrary . ]",
    "we regard that the four identified tdes listed in table  [ tde_sample ] constitute a complete sample from the _ maxi _ survey for 37 months , and we utilize them to derive the xlf . when integrated for 30 days , the _ maxi _ survey covers all the high galactic latitudes ( @xmath16 ) region , which corresponds to 83% of the entire sky .",
    "as described in the previous section , we have searched for tdes based on 30 days or 90 days binned light curves .",
    "thus , the sensitivity limit for the 30-days averaged peak flux of tdes to which our survey is complete is determined by that for 30-days integrated data of _ maxi_/gsc , which is 2.5 mcrab , or @xmath75 erg s@xmath6 @xmath39 ( 410 kev ) . for simplicity",
    ", we ignore the dependence of the sensitivity on sky positions @xcite , whose effects are much smaller than the statistical uncertainties in the xlf parameters .",
    "it is necessary to assume a spectrum to derive the luminosity from the observed count rate of _ maxi_/gsc .",
    "because the blackbody component can be ignored in the 410 kev band , here we assume a power - law spectrum absorbed with the hydrogen column - densities reported by the previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in the following analysis , for simplicity , we always adopt a photon index of 2 both for the comptonization and jet components , as a representative value .",
    "in fact , for all four tdes , the hardness ratio defined as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the count rates obtained from the _ maxi _ data in the 410 kev and 34 kev bands , respectively , is consistent with a photon index of 2.0 within uncertainties . in this case , the k - correction factor is always unity and @xmath79 .",
    "the calculated peak luminosity of each tde is listed in table  [ tde_sample ] .",
    "its systematic error due to the uncertainty in the peak - flux time within the bin size of the _ maxi _ light curve has negligible effect on our conclusions .",
    "we define the xlf of tdes so that represents the tde occurrence rate per unit co - moving volume per @xmath53 per unit rest - frame time , as a function of @xmath53 and @xmath30 , in units of mpc@xmath80 @xmath81 yr@xmath6 .",
    "note that this function has an additional dimension of per unit time compared with the `` instantaneous '' xlf of tdes and the xlf of agns ( see subsection [ cont_xlf ] ) , which represents the number density of tdes and agns , respectively , _ observed in a single epoch_.    in our work , we make simple assumptions for modelling the shape of the tde xlf .",
    "first , we write the tde occurrence rate per unit volume as a function of smbh mass",
    ". it should be proportional to the product of the smbh mass function ( i.e. , comoving number density of smbhs ) and a specific tde rate in a single smbh .",
    "the local smbh mass function can be derived from the local luminosity function of galaxies by using the faber - jackson relation between the galaxy luminosity and the smbh mass , @xmath82 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "unless otherwise noted , we adopt @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 according to the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite , where @xmath92 is the solar mass .",
    "we refer to the dependence of the specific tde rate on smbh mass derived by @xcite , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is chosen to be @xmath95 .    to represent the tde occurrence rate as a function of _ luminosity _",
    ", we further make an assumption that the peak luminosity @xmath96 of a tde ( i.e. , that free from the jet luminosity ) is proportional to the smbh mass , or equivalently , a constant fraction of the eddington luminosity , @xmath97 .",
    "then , by converting @xmath98 into @xmath96 in the product of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we can express the occurrence rate of tdes per unit volume in terms of @xmath96 as @xmath101 we incorporate a redshift dependence of the tde xlf with an evolution factor of @xmath102 that is multiplied to the local xlf .",
    "thus , the tde xlf is formulated as @xmath103      we approximate it by the shape of an initial mass function ( imf ) with an upper star mass boundary @xmath104 , considering that very massive stars are already dead due to their short life time . here",
    "we employ the imf derived by @xcite , which utilizes a larger sample than that by @xcite and is similar to that by @xcite . the normalized stellar mass function is continuously composed of next three equations ; @xmath105 and satisfies @xmath106 where we set @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we confirm that the choice of @xmath104 does not significantly affect our conclusions ( section  [ sec : eff_par ] ) .",
    "we adopt the unbinned maximum likelihood ( ml ) method to constrain the xlf parameters . while the ml fit gives the best - fit parameters , the goodness of the fit can not be evaluated .",
    "hence , we perform one dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test ( hereafter ks test ; e.g. , @xcite ) separately for the redshift distribution and for the luminosity distribution between the observed data and best - fit model . the p - value , the chance of getting observed data set , is evaluated from the d - value assuming the one - sided ks test statistic .",
    "the d - value is chosen to be the maximum value among the absolute distances between an empirical cumulative distribution function and a theoretical one .",

    "<S> we derive the first x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of stellar tidal disruption events ( tdes ) by supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , which gives an occurrence rate of tdes per unit volume as a function of peak luminosity and redshift , utilizing an unbiased sample observed by the monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( _ maxi _ ) . on the basis of the light curves characterized by a power - law decay with an index of @xmath0 , a systematic search using the _ maxi _ data in the first 37 months detected four tdes , </S>",
    "<S> all of which have been found in the literature . to formulate the tde xlf , we consider the mass function of smbhs , that of disrupted stars , the specific tde rate as a function of smbh mass , and the fraction of tdes with relativistic jets . </S>",
    "<S> we perform an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the _ maxi _ tde list and check the consistency with the observed tde rate in the _ rosat _ all sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the intrinsic fraction of the jet - accompanying events is @xmath1@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that at @xmath3 the contamination by tdes to the hard x - ray luminosity functions of active galactic nuclei is not significant and hence that their contribution to the growth of smbhs is negligible at the redshifts . </S>"
