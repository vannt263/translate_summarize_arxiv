    "0.2cm**harold :  * * for quite sometime now , you have been talking about ` gravity being an emergent phenomenon ' and a ` thermodynamic perspective on gravity ' .",
    "this is quite different from the conventional point of view in which gravity is a fundamental interaction and spacetime thermodynamics of , say , black holes is a particular result which can be derived in a specific context . honestly , while i find your papers fascinating i am not clear about the broad picture you are trying to convey .",
    "maybe you could begin by clarifying what this is all about , before we plunge into the details ? what is the roadmap , so to speak ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * to begin with , i will show you that the equations motion describing gravity in _ any diffeomorphism invariant theory _ can be given @xcite a suggestive thermodynamic re - interpretation ( sections [ sec : lro ] , [ sec : reinterpret ] ) .",
    "second , taking a cue from this , i can formulate a variational principle for a suitably defined entropy functional  involving both gravity and matter  which will lead to the field equations of gravity @xcite without varying the metric tensor as a dynamical variable ( section [ sec : eqnnewvar ] ) .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * suppose i have an action for gravity plus matter ( in @xmath0 dimensions ) @xmath1\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is any scalar built from metric and curvature and @xmath3 is the matter lagrangian depending on the metric and some matter variables @xmath4 .",
    "( i will assume @xmath5 does not involve derivatives of curvature tensor , to simplify the discussion . )",
    "if i vary @xmath6 in the action i will get some equations of motion ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , say , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is @xmath9 now , you are telling me that ( i ) you can give a thermodynamic interpretation to the equation @xmath7 just because it comes from a scalar lagrangian and ( ii ) you can also derive it from an entropy maximisation principle .",
    "i admit it is fascinating . but why should i take this approach as more fundamental , conceptually , than the good old way of just varying the total lagrangian @xmath10 and getting @xmath7 ?",
    "why is it more than a curiosity ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * that brings me to the third aspect of the formulation which i will discuss towards the end ( section [ sec : comaparison ] ) . in my approach , i can provide a natural explanation to several puzzling aspects of gravity and horizon thermodynamics all of which have to be thought of as mere algebraic accidents in the conventional approach you mentioned .",
    "let me give an analogy . in newtonian gravity , the fact that inertial mass is equal to the gravitational mass is an algebraic accident without any fundamental explanation .",
    "but in a geometrical theory of gravity based on principle of equivalence , this fact finds a natural explanation .",
    "similarly , i think we can make progress by identifying key facts which have no explanation in the conventional approach and providing them a natural explanation from a different perspective .",
    "you will also see that this approach connects up several pieces of conventional theory in an elegant manner .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * your ideas also seem to be quite different from other works which describe gravity as an emergent phenomena @xcite .",
    "can you explain _ your _ motivation ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * yes . the original inspiration for my work , as for many others , comes from the old idea of sakharov @xcite which attempted to describe spacetime dynamics as akin to the theory of elasticity .",
    "there are two crucial differences between my approach and many other ones .",
    "to begin with , i realized that the thermodynamic description transcends einstein s general relativity and can incorporate a much wider class of theories  this was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and elaborated in several of my papers  while many other approaches concentrated on just einstein s theory . in fact , many other approaches use techniques strongly linked to einstein s theory  like for example , raychaudhuri equation to study rate of change of horizon area , which is difficult to generalize to theories in which the horizon entropy is _ not _ proportional to horizon area .",
    "i use more general techniques .",
    "second , i work at the level of action principle and its symmetries to a large extent so i have a handle on the off - shell structure of the theory ; in fact , much of the thermodynamic interpretation in my approach is closely linked to the structure of action functional ( like e.g. , the existence of surface term in action , holographic nature etc . ) for gravitational theories .",
    "this link is central to me while it is not taken into account in any other approach .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * so essentially you are claiming that the thermodynamics of horizons is more central than the dynamics of the gravitational field while the conventional view is probably the other way around . why do you stress the thermal aspects of horizons so much ?",
    "can you give a motivation ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * because thermal phenomenon is a window to microstructure ! let me explain .",
    "we know that the continuum description of a fluid , say , in terms of a set of dynamical variables like density @xmath11 , velocity @xmath12 , etc . has a life of its own . at the same time , we also know that these dynamical variables and the description have no validity at a fundamental level where the matter is discrete .",
    "but one can actually _ guess _ the existence of microstructure without using any experimental proof for the molecular nature of the fluid , just from the fact that the fluid or a gas exhibits _ thermal phenomena _ involving temperature and transfer of heat energy . if the fluid is treated as a continuum and",
    "is described by @xmath13 , @xmath14 etc .",
    ", all the way down , then it is _ not _ possible to explain the thermal phenomena in a natural manner .",
    "as first stressed by boltzmann , the heat content of a fluid arises due to random motion of discrete microscopic structures which _ must _ exist in the fluid .",
    "these new degrees of freedom  which we now know are related to the actual molecules  make the fluid capable of storing energy internally and exchanging it with surroundings .",
    "so , given an apparently continuum phenomenon which exhibits temperature , boltzmann could infer the existence of underlying discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * i agree . but what does it lead to in the present context ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * the paradigm is : _ if you can heat it , it has microstructure ! _ and you can heat up spacetimes by collapsing matter or even by just accelerating @xcite . the horizons which arise in general relativity are endowed with temperatures @xcite which shows that , at least in this context , some microscopic degrees of freedom are coming into play .",
    "so a thermodynamic description that links the standard description of gravity with the statistical mechanics of  as yet unknown  microscopic degrees of freedom must exist .",
    "it is in this sense that i consider gravity to be emergent .",
    "boltzmann s insight about the thermal behaviour has two other attractive features which are useful in our context .",
    "first , while the existence of the discrete degrees of freedom is vital in such an approach , the exact nature of the degrees of freedom is largely irrelevant .",
    "for example , whether we are dealing with argon molecules or helium molecules is largely irrelevant in the formulation of gas laws and such differences can be taken care of in terms of a few well - chosen numbers ( like , e.g. , the specific heat ) .",
    "this suggests that such a description will have certain amount of robustness and independence as regards the precise nature of microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "second , the entropy of the system arises due to our ignoring the microscopic degrees of freedom . turning this around",
    ", one can expect the form of entropy functional to encode the essential aspects of microscopic degrees of freedom , even if we do not know what they are .",
    "if we can arrive at the appropriate form of entropy functional , in terms of some effective degrees of freedom , then we can expect it to provide the correct description",
    ". will have universal applicability as long as effects of relativity or quantum theory are incorporated in the definition of @xmath15 appropriately . ]",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * but most people working in quantum gravity will agree that there is some fundamental microstructure to spacetime ( `` atoms of spacetime '' ) and the description of spacetime by metric is an approximate long distance description .",
    "so why are you making a big deal ?",
    "i do nt see anything novel here .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * i will go farther than just saying there is microstructure and show you how to actually use the thermodynamic concepts to provide an emergent description of gravity  which no one else has attempted .",
    "if you think of the full theory of quantum gravity as analogous to statistical mechanics then i will provide the thermodynamic description of the same system .",
    "as you know , thermodynamics was developed and used effectively decades before we knew anything about the molecular structure of matter or its statistical mechanics .",
    "similarly , even without knowing the microstructure of spacetime or the full quantum theory of gravity , we can make lot of progress with the thermodynamic description of spacetime .",
    "the horizon thermodynamics , i will claim , provides @xcite valuable insights about the nature of gravity totally independent of what `` the atoms of spacetime '' may be .",
    "it is somewhat like being able to describe or work with gases or steam engines without knowing anything about the molecular structure of the gas or steam .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * all right .",
    "i hope all these will become clearer as we go along .",
    "maybe i can suggest we plunge head - long into how _",
    "you _ would like to describe gravity .",
    "then i can raise the issues as we proceed .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * the overall structure of my approach is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : synthesis ] . as you can see , i begin with the principle of equivalence which allows you to draw three key consequences .",
    "first , it tells you that  in the long wavelength limit  gravity has @xcite a geometrical description in terms of the metric tensor @xmath16 and the effect of gravity on matter can be understood by using the laws of special relativity in the local inertial frames .",
    "second , by writing maxwell s equations in curved spacetime using minimal coupling , say , i can convince myself that the light cone structure of the spacetime  and hence the causal structure  will , in general , be affected by the gravitational field .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * well , that is one possible way of interpreting principle of equivalence though people might have other views .",
    "but once you have told me what you are assuming , viz .",
    ", `` gravity = geometry '' and `` light cones are affected by gravity '' , we can proceed further .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * yes . my aim here will be not to nitpick over definitions but develop the physics in a consistent manner . in that spirit",
    ", i would draw one more conclusion from the fact that gravity can be described using a metric tensor .",
    "in flat spacetime , we can choose a special coordinate system with the global metric being @xmath17 ; so if someone tells you that the metric is given by @xmath18 then you can always attribute the part @xmath19 to the choice of non - inertial coordinates .",
    "we can not do this in a curved spacetime .",
    "so it no longer makes sense to ask  how much of @xmath16 \" is due to our using non - inertial coordinates and  how much \" is due to genuine gravity .",
    "different observers in different states of motion might use different coordinates leading to different sets of ten functions for @xmath18 . because we have no absolute reference",
    "metric it follows that no coordinate system or observer is special .",
    "the laws of physics should not select out any special class of observers .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * this smacks of principle of general covariance but essentially you are arguing @xcite for democracy of all observers , which i grant you . given all the philosophical controversies as to what `",
    "general covariance ' means , i agree this is a safer procedure .",
    "what next ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * given the fact that all observers are equal and that light cones are affected by gravity , it follows that there will exist observers who do not have access to part of the spacetime because of the existence of horizons they perceive .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that metric determines the paths of light rays and hence the causal structure .",
    "the classic example is the rindler horizon in flat spacetime which is as effective in blocking information with respect to an accelerated observer as the schwarzschild horizon at @xmath20 is for an observer at @xmath21 .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * not so fast ; i have several problems here .",
    "first , the conventional view is that black hole horizons are `` real horizons '' while rindler horizons are sort of fraudulent ; you seem to club them together .",
    "second , you seem to link horizons to observers rather than treat them as well defined , geometrical , causal features of a spacetime .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * you are quite right .",
    "i treat all horizons at equal footing and claim that  for _ my _ purpose  all horizons are observer dependent .",
    "this is because , the key property of horizons which i am concentrating here is that it can block information . in that sense ,",
    "the rindler horizon does not block information for an inertial observer _ just as _ the schwarzschild horizon does _ not _ block information for someone plunging into the black hole .",
    "so , for my purpose , there is no need to make artificial distinctions between a black hole horizon and a rindler horizon .",
    "the state of motion of the observer is crucial in deciding the physical effects of a horizon _ in all cases_.    it is , of course , true that one can give a geometric interpretation to , say , the black hole event horizon .",
    "i am not denying that .",
    "but that fact , as you will see , is quite irrelevant to the development of my approach .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * i see that you not only demand democracy of observers but also democracy of horizons !",
    "you do nt think , for example , that black hole horizons are anything special .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * yes . i do believe in the democracy of horizons , as you put it . the attempts to provide a quantum gravitational interpretation of black holes , their entropy etc . using _ very special _ approaches which are incapable of handling other horizons  like the issues in de sitter @xcite ,",
    "let alone rindler  are interesting in a limited sort of way but may not get us anywhere ultimately .    0.2cm**harold :  * * i have another problem .",
    "you really havent characterized what exactly you mean by a horizon for an observer .",
    "of course , you can not use any on - shell constructs since you are still developing your approach towards field equations .",
    "there are horizons and horizons in the literature  event , apparent , causal ....",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * i will try to make clear what i _ need _ without again going into all sorts of definitions @xcite .",
    "choose any event @xmath22 and introduce a local inertial frame ( lif ) around it with riemann normal coordinates @xmath23 such that @xmath22 has the coordinates @xmath24 in the lif .",
    "let @xmath25 be a future directed null vector at @xmath22 and we align the coordinates of lif such that it lies in the @xmath26 plane at @xmath22 .",
    "next transform from the lif to a local rindler frame ( lrf ) coordinates @xmath27 by accelerating along the x - axis with an acceleration @xmath28 by the usual transformation .",
    "the metric near the origin now reduces to the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and ( @xmath31 ) or ( @xmath32 ) are the coordinates of lrf ( both these forms are useful in our discussion ) .",
    "let @xmath33 be the approximate killing vector corresponding to translation in the rindler time such that the vanishing of @xmath34 characterizes the location of the local horizon @xmath35 in lrf . as usual",
    ", we shall do all the computation on a timelike surface infinitesimally away from @xmath35 with @xmath36 constant , usually called a `` stretched horizon '' .",
    "( it can be defined more formally using the orbits of @xmath33 and the plane orthogonal to the acceleration vector @xmath37 . )",
    "let the timelike unit normal to the stretched horizon be @xmath38 .",
    "this lrf ( with metric in ) and its local horizon @xmath35 will exist within a region of size @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is a typical component of curvature tensor of the background spacetime ) as long as @xmath41 .",
    "this condition can always be satisfied by taking a sufficiently large @xmath28 .",
    "this procedure introduces a class of uniformly accelerated observers who will perceive the null surface @xmath42 as the local rindler horizon @xmath35 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ray1 ] .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * i am with you so far",
    ". essentially you are using the fact that you have two length scales in the problem at any event .",
    "first is the length scale @xmath43 associated with the curvature components of the background metric over which you have no control ; second is the length scale @xmath44 associated with the accelerated trajectory which you can choose as you please .",
    "so you can always ensure that @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , i can see this clearly in the euclidean sector in which the horizon maps to the origin ( see fig.[fig : ray3 ] ) .",
    "the locally flat frame in the euclidean sector will exist in a region of radius @xmath43 while the trajectory of a uniformly accelerated observer will be a circle of radius @xmath44 .",
    "you can always keep the latter inside the former .",
    "the metric in is just the metric of the locally flat region in polar coordinates .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * yes . in fact , i can choose a trajectory @xmath45 such that its acceleration @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 is the time - like four velocity ) satisfies the condition @xmath48 . in a suitably chosen lif this trajectory will reduce to the standard hyperbola of a uniformly accelerated observer .",
    "it is using these lrfs that i define my horizons around any event .",
    "further the local temperature on the stretched horizon will be @xmath49 so that @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * ha !",
    "the classical gr is fine but your ` horizon ' is just a patch of null surface .",
    "can you actually prove that local rindler observers will perceive a temperature proportional to acceleration ?",
    "the usual proofs of unruh effect are @xcite horribly global .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * recall that everything we do is in a local region with @xmath41 .",
    "now if you have an accelerated detector with time - dependent , variable acceleration , say , then you will reproduce the standard unruh effect _ approximately _ to the necessary order of accuracy .",
    "this should be intuitively obvious but can be demonstrated @xcite .",
    "of course in the euclidean sector the rindler observer s trajectory is a circle of radius @xmath44 which can be made arbitrarily close to the origin .",
    "suppose the observer s trajectory has the usual form @xmath52 which is maintained for a time interval @xmath53 .",
    "then , the trajectory will complete a full circle _ in the euclidean sector _",
    "irrespective of what happens later ! when we work in the limit of @xmath54 , this becomes arbitrarily local in both space _ and _ time @xcite .",
    "i am sure all these can be made more rigorous but this is the essential reason behind the local ideas working .",
    "i also want to stress that once i finally reach my goal ( of deriving the gravitational field equations from an entropy principle in section [ sec : eqnnewvar ] ) all these become irrelevant ; they are essentially part of ` motivation ' .",
    "so your possible misgivings regarding some of these details will not affect the final result .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * ok , so you have local rindler observers crawling all over the spacetime with their local horizons .",
    "what next ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * it is now easy to see that all horizons must have entropy vis - a - vis the observers who perceive the horizons .",
    "if they do not , an observer can pour some hot tea with entropy across the horizon _  la wheeler _ @xcite , thereby violating the second law of thermodynamics in the region accessible to her and her friends who perceive the horizon @xmath35 .",
    "such a violation of second law of thermodynamics can be avoided only if we _",
    "demand _ that horizon should have an entropy which should increase when energy flows across it .",
    "if energy @xmath55 flows across a hot horizon with temperature @xmath56 then @xmath57 should be the change in the entropy of the horizon .",
    "we therefore conclude that all null surfaces which could locally act as one - way membranes should have an ( observer dependent ) entropy associated with them .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * hold on .",
    "i understand from the reference you cite @xcite that such a thought experiment might have had something to do with the initial realization of a black hole entropy which is proportional to the area @xcite .",
    "but i am not sure how to interpret it precisely . for one thing",
    ", matter disappears into the horizon only after infinite time as perceived by the outside observer , even when you try to pour real tea in to real black hole .",
    "so what is all this talk about `` loss '' of entropy ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * i do nt think this is a real objection though one often comes across this confusion .",
    "note that , by the same argument , no black hole can ever form in finite time anywhere in the universe and we should not be talking about any black hole physics .",
    "i believe this issue is well settled in chapter 33 of ref .",
    "i recommend you read it !",
    "if you really push me hard , i can wiggle out with the following argument .",
    "it does not take much time ( certainly not infinite time ! ) for a cup of tea to reach a radial distance a few planck lengths away from the horizon @xmath20 .",
    "we have considerable evidence of very different nature to suggest planck length acts as lower bound to the length scales that can be operationally defined and that no measurements can be ultra sharp at planck scales @xcite .",
    "so one can not really talk about the location of the event horizon ignoring fluctuations of this order .",
    "so , from the point of view of sensible physics , i only need to get the cup of tea up to @xmath58 to talk about entropy loss .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * you also seem to have quietly made entropy an observer dependent quantity .",
    "_ this is pretty drastic _ and i need to understand it .",
    "suppose , in a region around an event @xmath22 , there is some matter which is producing the curvature .",
    "i would have normally thought that this matter  say some amount of hot fluid  has certain amount of entropy which is independent of who is measuring it .",
    "but you are claiming that an inertial observer and a rindler observer will attribute different amounts of entropy to this matter .",
    "is that correct ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * that s correct and may be i should write a paper explaining this @xcite but this really need not come as a surprise ( also see ref.@xcite ) . we know that an inertial observer will attribute zero temperature and zero entropy to the inertial vacuum . but a rindler observer will attribute a finite temperature and non - zero ( formally divergent ) entropy to the same vacuum state .",
    "so entropy is indeed an observer dependent concept .",
    "when you do quantum field theory in curved spacetime , it is not only that particles become an observer dependent notion so do the temperature and entropy .",
    "this notion can be made more precise as follows :    consider an excited state of a quantum field with energy @xmath59 above the ground state in an inertial spacetime .",
    "when you integrate out the unobservable modes for the rindler observer , you will get a density matrix @xmath60 for this state and the corresponding entropy will be @xmath61 .",
    "the inertial vacuum state has the density matrix @xmath62 and the entropy @xmath63 .",
    "the difference @xmath64 is finite and represents the entropy attributed to this state by the rindler observer .",
    "( this is finite though @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be divergent . ) in the limit of @xmath67 , in which we are working , we can actually compute it and show that @xmath68 to see this , note that if we write @xmath69 , then in the limit of @xmath67 we can concentrate on states for which @xmath70",
    ". then we have @xmath71 where we have used the facts tr @xmath72 and @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the hamiltonian for the system in the rindler frame .",
    "the last line defines the @xmath59 in terms of the difference in the expectation values of the hamiltonian in the two states .",
    "( there are some subtleties in this derivation , especially regarding the assumption @xmath70 , but i will not get into it here @xcite . ) this is the amount of entropy a rindler observer would claim she has lost when the matter disappears into the horizon .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * that is very curious .",
    "i would have thought that the expression for entropy of matter should consist of its energy @xmath59 and _ its own _",
    "temperature @xmath75 rather than the horizon temperature .",
    "it looks like that the matter somehow equilibrates to the horizon temperature so that @xmath76 gives the relevant entropy .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * yes .",
    "this can be explicitly proved , for example , for the one particle state @xcite and here is a possible interpretation .",
    "you should think of horizon as a system with some internal degrees of freedom and temperature @xmath56 _ as far as rindler observer is concerned_. so when you add an energy @xmath59 to it , the entropy change is @xmath77 .",
    "all these are not _ new _ mysteries but only the manifestation of the old mystery , viz .",
    ", a rindler observer attributes a non - zero temperature to inertial vacuum .",
    "this temperature influences every other thermodynamic variable .",
    "i will come back to this point later on because it is quite important .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * ok . let us proceed .",
    "i also see where your insistence of democracy of observers comes in .",
    "you want to demand that the local rindler observer has a right to expect the standard laws of physics to hold as much as any other observer , horizons notwithstanding .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * i am glad you brought this up .",
    "this was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite in which we assert that _ all observers have a right to describe physics using an effective theory based only on the variables she can access .",
    "_ in the study of particle physics models , this concept forms the cornerstone of the renormalization group theory .",
    "to describe particle interactions at 10 gev in the lab , we usually do not need to know what happens at @xmath78 gev in theories which have predictive power . in the absence of such a principle ,",
    "very high energy phenomena ( which are unknown from direct experiments in the lab ) will affect the low energy phenomena which we are attempting to study .    in the context of a theory involving a nontrivial metric of spacetime , we need a similar principle to handle the fact that different observers will have access to different regions of a general spacetime .",
    "if a class of observers perceive a horizon , they should still be able to do physics using only the variables accessible to them without having to know what happens on the other side of the horizon .",
    "this , in turn , implies that there should exist a mechanism which will encode the information in the region @xmath79 which is inaccessible to a particular observer at the boundary @xmath80 of that region .",
    "keep this in mind because i will show you later where this fits in with the holographic nature of action functionals .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * fine , we will get back to it . to get on with the story",
    ", you need to formulate some kind of entropy balance when matter flows across a local horizon",
    ". how do you propose to do it ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * around any event in any spacetime we now have a local inertial frame and  by boosting along one of the axes with an acceleration @xmath28  we have introduced a local rindler observer who perceives a horizon with temperature proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "she will attribute a loss of entropy @xmath81 when matter with an amount of energy @xmath59 gets close to the horizon ( within a few planck lengths , say ) . if @xmath33 is the approximate , killing vector corresponding to translations in rindler time ,",
    "the appropriate energy - momentum density is @xmath82 .",
    "( it is the integral of @xmath83 that gives the rindler hamiltonian @xmath74 , which leads to evolution in rindler time @xmath84 and appears in the thermal density matrix @xmath85 . )",
    "the energy flux through a patch of stretched horizon with normal @xmath38 will be @xmath86 and the associated entropy flux will be @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the local temperature with @xmath89 being the standard lapse function giving the redshift factor .",
    "( in conformity with , i am using the horizon temperature and not the matter temperature ) . this entropy flux manifests as the entropy change of the locally perceived horizon .",
    "for all these to hold locally at every event there _ must exist a spacetime entropy current _ @xmath90 , built out of metric and its derivatives , such that @xmath91 gives the corresponding gravitational entropy flux .",
    "so we expect the relation @xmath92 to hold at all events with some @xmath93 , once we introduce a local killing vector @xmath33 and a local temperature giving @xmath94 .",
    "further @xmath93 must be conserved since we do not expect irreversible entropy production in the spacetime .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * this sounds strange!. why should there exists a conserved current @xmath93 , built from geometrical variables , at every event in some arbitrary spacetime , which will conveniently give you the entropy balance you require ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * it is actually not all that strange",
    "! remember that we got into all these because of the democracy of the observers which , in turn , implies general covariance .",
    "the mathematical content of general covariance is captured by the diffeomorphism invariance of whatever theory which is going to ultimately determine the dynamics of the spacetime . because the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory forced us to treat all observers on equal footing",
    ", the diffeomorphism invariance must also provide us with the conserved current @xmath93 .",
    "and indeed it does , in the form of the noether current @xcite .",
    "let me explain .",

    "0.2cm**harold :  * * usually in an action principle one varies all the degrees of freedom in any order one chooses .",
    "but in your extremum principle , we are expected to vary only @xmath189 .",
    "how would i get equations of motion for matter in this approach ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * that is not a problem . at the classical level , the field equations are already contained in the condition @xmath288 which i impose ( with an intriguing interpretation , which you may not want to buy , that this is the constancy of elastic constants ! )",
    "if you want to do quantum field theory in a curved spacetime , you can again use these field equations in the heisenberg picture .",
    "the only question is when you insist that you need to do a path integral quantizations of the matter fields .",

    "but after you have done that and written down the field equations for gravity , you can do the usual variation of matter lagrangian in a given curved spacetime and get the standard equations @xcite .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * i also notice that while the vector field @xmath211 in lif , to the lowest order , has no bulk dynamics , if you consider the integral over the lagrangian in a small region in lif , you will get a surface contribution . that seems strange , too .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * not really .",
    "i am not surprised by @xmath210 picking up just a surface contribution because  even in the conventional approach  einstein - hilbert action is holographic in a specific sense of the word @xcite and does exactly that .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * may be this is good time to sort this out .",
    "you mentioned earlier that the democracy of observers and their right to do physics in spite of the existence of horizons has something to do with the holography of action .",
    "i have no idea what you are talking about here !",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * let me elaborate .",
    "we said that there should exist a mechanism which will encode the information in the region @xmath79 which is inaccessible to a particular observer at the boundary @xmath80 of that region@xcite . one possible way of ensuring this is to add a suitable boundary term to the action principle which will provide additional information content for observers who perceive a horizon .",
    "such a procedure leads to three immediate consequences .",
    "first , if the theory is generally covariant , so that observers with horizons ( like , for example , uniformly accelerated observers using a rindler metric ) need to be accommodated in the theory , such a theory _ must _ have an action functional that contains a surface term .",
    "the generally covariant action in einstein s theory did contain a surface term .",
    "the present approach explains the logical necessity for such a surface term in a generally covariant theory which was not evident in the standard approach .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * that s interesting .",
    "you are now claiming that there is a connection between the following three facts .",
    "( 1 ) the theory for gravity is built from a generally covariant lagrangian .",
    "( 2 ) in a geometrical theory of gravity , horizons are inevitable but general covariance demands that all observers have an equal right to describe physics . ( 3 ) observers whose information is blocked by a horizon should still be able to somehow get around this fact with the information encoded on the boundary .",
    "therefore , the lagrangian must have a boundary term .",
    "viewed this way , it appears natural that the only generally covariant scalar lagrangian proportional to @xmath289 leads to a surface term in the action . but how does the surface term know what it is going on in the bulk ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * that is the second point .",
    "if the surface term has to encode the information which is blocked by the horizon , then there must exist a simple relation between the bulk term and surface term in the action and hence you can not choose just any scalar .",
    "this is indeed the case for the einstein - hilbert action ; there is a peculiar ( unexplained ) relationship between @xmath290 and @xmath291 : @xmath292 this shows that the einstein - hilbert gravitational action is ` holographic ' with the same information being coded in both the bulk and surface terms .",
    "in fact , in any local region around an event , it is the surface term which contributes to the action at the lowest order . in the neighborhood of any event , the riemann",
    "normal coordinates in which @xmath293 . in the gravitational lagrangian @xmath294 with @xmath295 and @xmath296 ,",
    "the @xmath297 term vanishes in this neighborhood while @xmath298 leading to @xmath299 showing that in a small region around the event in the riemann normal coordinates , gravitational action can be reduced to a pure surface term .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * so in this perspective , you also expect the surface term to be related to the information content blocked by the horizon , right ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * indeed .",
    "that is the third point .",
    "if the surface term encodes information which is blocked by the horizon , then it should actually lead to the entropy of the horizon .",
    "in other words , we should be able to compute the horizon entropy by evaluating the surface term .",
    "this is indeed true and can be easily demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the surface term does give the horizon entropy for any metric for which near - horizon geometry has the rindler form .",
    "this explains another deep mystery in the conventional approach . in the usual approach ,",
    "we _ ignore _ the surface term completely ( or cancel it with a counter - term ) and obtain the field equation from the bulk term in the action .",
    "any solution to the field equation obtained by this procedure is logically independent of the nature of the surface term .",
    "but we find that when the _ surface term _ ( which was ignored ) is evaluated at the horizon that arises in any given solution , it does correctly give the entropy of the horizon !",
    "this is possible only because there is a relationship , given by , between the surface term and the bulk term which is again an unexplained feature in the conventional approach to gravitational dynamics . since the surface term has the thermodynamic interpretation as the entropy of horizons , and is related holographically to the bulk term , we are again led to an indirect connection between spacetime dynamics and horizon thermodynamics .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * i agree these results are extremely mysterious in the conventional approach , now that you brought it up .",
    "i have not seen mentioned , let alone discussed in any work ( other than yours , of course . )",
    "i presume this is one of what you call ` algebraic accidents ' .",
    "but if your ideas about lanczos - lovelock  theory being the natural candidate in d dimensions then the same ` algebraic accident ' should occur in lanczos - lovelock  theories as well , right ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * yes . in fact it does  which is gratifying  and acts as a nontrivial consistency check on my alternative perspective .",
    "one can show that the surface and bulk terms of all lanczos - lovelock  theories satisfy an equation similar to . of course ,",
    "since it was nt noticed for hilbert action , nobody bothered about lanczos - lovelock  action till we @xcite unearthed it .",
    "one can provide a simple , yet very general , proof of the connection between entropy and surface term in action in any static spacetime .",
    "such a spacetime will have a killing vector @xmath33 and a corresponding noether current .",
    "taking the @xmath145 component of and writing @xmath300 we obtain @xmath301 only spatial derivatives contribute in the first term on the right hand side when the spacetime is static .",
    "this relation shows that the action obtained by integrating @xmath302 will generically have a surface term related to @xmath111 ( in einstein gravity will read as @xmath303 ; our result generalises the fact that @xmath304 can be expressed as a total divergence in static spacetimes .",
    ") this again illustrates , in a very general manner , why the surface terms in the action functional lead to horizon entropy .",
    "in fact can be integrated to show that in any static spacetime with a bifurcation horizon , the action can be interpreted as the free energy which generalises a result known in einstein gravity to lanczos - lovelock  models .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * what are the other key algebraic accidents in the conventional approach which your perspective throws light on ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * there are several but let me describe one which is really striking ( and was first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . consider a static , spherically symmetric horizon , in a spacetime described by a metric : @xmath305 let the location of the horizon be given by the simple zero of the function @xmath306 , say at @xmath307 .",
    "the taylor series expansion of @xmath306 near the horizon @xmath308 shows that the metric reduces to the rindler metric near the horizon in the @xmath309 plane with the surface gravity @xmath310 .",

    "the association of temperature in with the metric in only requires the conditions @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "the discussion so far did not assume anything about the dynamics of gravity or einstein s field equations .",
    "we shall now take the next step and write down the einstein equation for the metric in , which is given by @xmath314 where @xmath315 is the radial pressure . when evaluated on the horizon @xmath307",
    "we get the result : @xmath316 = 4\\pi p a^2 \\label{reqa}\\ ] ] if we now consider two solutions to the einstein s equations differing infinitesimally in the parameters such that horizons occur at two different radii @xmath317 and @xmath318 , then multiplying the by @xmath319 , we get : @xmath320 the right hand side is just @xmath321 where @xmath322 is what is called the areal volume which is the relevant quantity when we consider the action of pressure on a surface area . in the first term , we note that @xmath323 is proportional to horizon temperature in . rearranging this term slightly and introducing a @xmath324 factor _ by hand _ into an otherwise classical equation to bring in the horizon temperature , we can rewrite as @xmath325 the labels below the equation indicate a natural  and unique  interpretation for each of the terms and the whole equation now becomes @xmath326 allowing us to read off the expressions for entropy and energy : @xmath327 where @xmath328 is the horizon area and @xmath329 .",
    "the result shows that einstein s equations can be re - interpreted as a thermodynamic identity for a virtual displacement of the horizon by an amount @xmath319 .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * i suppose the uniqueness of the factor @xmath330 , where @xmath331 is the proper area of a surface of radius @xmath317 in spherically symmetric spacetimes , implies that we can not carry out the same exercise by multiplying by some other arbitrary factor @xmath332 instead of just @xmath319 in a natural fashion .",
    "this , in turn , uniquely fixes both @xmath55 and the combination @xmath333 .",

    "more sharply stated , we have no explanation as to why an equation like should hold in classical gravity , if we take the conventional route .",

    "0.2cm**harold :  * * if so the idea should also have a more general validity .",

    "0.2cm**me :  * * yes . one can again show that the field equations of more general theories of gravity ( like in lanczos - lovelock  models ) also reduce to the same thermodynamic identity @xmath340 when evaluated on the horizon .",

    "then , we can prove ` no - go ' theorem that the cosmological constant  problem can not be solved in such model @xcite .",
    "the proof is elementary .",
    "our demand ( 2 ) of general covariance requires the matter action to be an integral over @xmath361 .",
    "the demand ( 3 ) now allows us to add a constant @xmath362 , say , to @xmath363 leading to a coupling @xmath364 between @xmath362 and the metric @xmath16 . by our demand ( 1 ) ,",
    "when we vary @xmath16 the theory will couple to @xmath362 through a term proportional to @xmath365 thereby introducing an arbitrary cosmological constant  into the theory .",
    "the power of the above ` no - go theorem ' lies in its simplicity !",
    "it clearly shows that we can not solve cosmological constant  problem unless we drop one of the three demands listed in the above paragraph . of these",
    ", we do not want to sacrifice general covariance encoded in ( 2 ) ; neither do we have a handle on low energy matter lagrangian so we can not avoid ( 3 ) .",
    "so the only hope we have is to introduce an approach in which gravitational field equations are obtained from varying some degrees of freedom other than @xmath16 in a maximization principle .",
    "this suggests that the so called cosmological constant problem has its roots in our misunderstanding of the nature of gravity .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * i thought that any spin-2 long range field @xmath366 ( arising , for example , in the linear perturbation around flat spacetime through @xmath367 ) obeying principle of equivalence has to generically couple to @xmath99 through a term in the action @xmath368 .",
    "but in your model , this does not seem to happen .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * that s correct .",
    "it is sometimes claimed that a spin-2 graviton in the linear limit _ has to _ couple to @xmath99 in a universal manner , in which case , one will have the graviton coupling to the cosmological constant . in our approach , the linearized field equations for the spin-2 graviton field @xmath369 , in a suitable gauge , will be @xmath370 for all null vectors",
    "this equation is still invariant under @xmath359 showing that the graviton does _ not _ couple to cosmological constant .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * but can you predict the observed value of the cosmological constant  in your approach ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * alas , no .",
    "but i claim providing a mechanism in which the _ bulk cosmological constant decouples from gravity _ is a major step forward .",
    "if the cosmological constant  was strictly zero , my perspective has a natural explanation for it  which no one else had !",
    "it was always thought that this should arise from some unknown symmetry and i have provided you with a model which has such symmetry .",
    "i believe the small value of the observed cosmological constant  arises from non - perturbative quantum gravitational effects at the next order , but i do nt have a fully satisfactory model .",
    "( see , however , ref .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * we have covered a lot of ground some of which is purely technical while the rest are conceptual or interpretational . in your mind",
    "the distinction may be unimportant but others will react differently to results which can be rigorously proved compared to interpretational aspects , however elegant the latter may be",
    ". may be you would care to separate them out and provide a summary ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * fine . from a purely algebraic point of view , without bringing in any physical interpretation or motivation , we can prove the following mathematical results :    * consider a functional of null vector fields @xmath213 in an arbitrary spacetime given by [ or , more generally , by ] . demanding that this functional is an extremum for all null vectors @xmath189 leads to the field equations for the background geometry given by @xmath371 where @xmath8 is given by [ or , more generally , by ] .",
    "thus field equations in a wide class of theories of gravity can be obtained from an extremum principle without varying the metric as a dynamical variable .",
    "* these field equations are invariant under the transformation @xmath359 , which relates to the freedom of introducing a cosmological constant  as an integration constant in the theory .",
    "further , this symmetry forbids the inclusion of a cosmological constant term in the variational principle by hand as a low energy parameter . _",
    "that is , we have found a symmetry which makes the bulk cosmological constant  decouple from the gravity .",
    "_ when linearized around flat spacetime , the graviton inherits this symmetry and does not couple to the cosmological constant . * on - shell , the functional in [ or , more generally , by ] contributes only on the boundary of the region . when the boundary is a horizon , this terms gives precisely the wald entropy of the theory .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * it is remarkable that you can derive not only einstein s theory uniquely in @xmath257 but even lanczos - lovelock  theory in @xmath372 from an extremum principle involving the null normals _ without varying @xmath16 in an action functional!_. i also see from that in the case of einstein s theory , you have an lagrangian @xmath373})n^b$ ] for a vector field @xmath189 which becomes vacuous in flat spacetime in which covariant derivatives become partial derivatives .",
    "there is clearly no dynamics in @xmath189 but they do play a crucial role .",
    "so i see that you can get away without ever telling me what the null vectors @xmath189 actually means because they disappear from the scene after serving their purpose .",
    "while this may be mathematically clever , it is very unsatisfactory physically .",
    "you may not have a rigorous model for these degrees of freedom but what is your picture ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * my picture is made of the following ingredients , each of which seems reasonable but far from having rigorous mathematical justification at this stage .",
    "* assume that the spacetime is endowed with certain microscopic degrees of freedom capable of exhibiting thermal phenomena .",
    "this is just the boltzmann paradigm : _ if one can heat it , it must have microstructure ! _ ; and one can heat up a spacetime .",
    "* whenever a class of observers perceive a horizon , they are `` heating up the spacetime '' and the degrees of freedom close to a horizon participate in a very _ observer dependent _ thermodynamics .",
    "matter which flows close to the horizon ( say , within a few planck lengths of the horizon ) transfers energy to these microscopic , near - horizon , degrees of freedom _ as far as the observer who sees the horizon is concerned_. just as entropy of a normal system at temperature @xmath56 will change by @xmath374 when we transfer to it an energy @xmath59 , here also an entropy change will occur .",
    "( a freely falling observer in the same neighbourhood , of course , will deny all these ! ) * we proved that when the field equations of gravity hold , one can interpret this entropy change in a purely geometrical manner involving the noether current . from this point of view",
    ", the normals @xmath189 to local patches of null surfaces are related to the ( unknown ) degrees of freedom that can participate in the thermal phenomena involving the horizon . * just as demanding the validity of special relativistic laws with respect to all freely falling observers leads to the kinematics of gravity , demanding the local entropy balance in terms of the thermodynamic variables as perceived by local rindler observers leads to the field equations of gravity in the form @xmath371 .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * it is an interesting picture but is _ totally observer dependent _ , right ?",
    "a local rindler observer or an observer outside a black hole horizon might attribute all kinds of thermodynamics and entropy changes to the horizons she perceives .",
    "but an inertial observer or an observer falling through the schwarzschild horizon will see none of these phenomena .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * exactly .",
    "i claim we need to accept the fact that a whole lot of thermodynamic phenomena needs to be now thought of as observer dependent . for example , if you throw some hot matter on to a schwarzschild black hole , then when it gets to a few planck lengths away from the horizon and hovers around it , i expect it to interact with the microscopic horizon degrees of freedom _ as far as an outside observer is concerned_. after all , such an observer would claim that all matter stays arbitrarily close but outside the horizon for all eternity",
    ". a freely falling observer through the horizon will have a completely different picture but we have learnt to live with this dichotomy as far as elementary kinematics goes .",
    "i think we need to do the same as regards thermodynamics and quantum processes .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * in a way , every key progress in physics involved realizing that something we thought as absolute is not absolute .",
    "with special relativity it was the flow of time and with general relativity it was the concept of global inertial frames and when we brought in quantum fields in curved spacetime it was the notion of particles .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * and the notion of temperature , do nt forget that .",
    "we now know that the temperature attributed to even vacuum state depends on the observer . we need to go further and integrate the entire thermodynamic machinery  involving highly excited semi - classical states , say , cups of tea with ( what we believe to be ) `` real '' temperature  with this notion of lrfs having their own temperature .",
    "i do nt think this has been done in a satisfactory manner yet @xcite .",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * so , what next ? what is the `` to do list '' ?",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * to name a few which comes to ones mind , i can list them as technical ones and conceptual ones . on the technical side :    \\(i ) it would be nice to make the notion of lrf and the horizon a bit more rigorous .",
    "for example , the idea of an approximate killing vector could be made more precise and one might like to establish the connection between locality , that is apparent in the euclidean sector and the causality , which is apparent in the lorentzian section that has the light cones . by and large",
    ", one would like to make rigorous the use of lrfs by , say , computing the next order corrections .",
    "\\(ii ) a lot more can be done to clarify the observer dependence of the entropy .",
    "( the study of horizon thermodynamics makes one realize that one does not really quite understand what entropy is ! ) .",
    "it essentially involves _ exact _ computation of @xmath375 where @xmath376 and @xmath66 are the entropies attributed to the excited and ground state by a rindler observer .",
    "this should throw more light on the expression for @xmath377 used in .",
    "in particular , it would be nice to have a detailed model which shows why @xmath377 involves the combination of @xmath59 of matter and @xmath56 of the horizon . one",
    "would then use these insights to understand why actually represents the relevant entropy functional for matter for arbitrary @xmath99 .",
    "\\(iii ) it will be nice to have a handle on the positivity or otherwise of the entropy functional used in .",
    "these technical issues , i believe can be tackled in more or less straightforward manner , though the mathematics can be fairly involved . but",
    "as i said , they are probably not crucial to the alternative perspective or its further progress .",
    "the latter will depend on more serious conceptual issues , some of which are the following :    \\(i ) how come the microstructure of spacetime exhibits itself indirectly through the horizon temperature even at scales much larger than planck length ?",
    "i believe this is because the event horizon works as some kind of magnifying glass allowing us to probe trans - planckian physics @xcite but this notion needs to be made more precise .",
    "\\(ii ) how does one obtain the expression for entropy in from some microscopic model ?",
    "in particular , such an analysis  even with a toy model  should throw more light on why normals to local patches of null surfaces play such a crucial role as effective degrees of freedom in the long wavelength limit .",
    "of course , such a model should also determine the expression for @xmath227 and get the metric tensor and spacetime as derived concepts - a fairly tall order!. ( this is somewhat like obtaining theory of elasticity starting from a microscopic model for a solid , which , incidentally , is not a simple task either . )",
    "0.2cm**harold :  * * but what about the `` deep questions '' like , for example , the physics near the singularities",
    "? since you get the same field equations as anybody else does , you will have the same solutions , same singularities etc .",
    "0.2cm**me :  * * i told you that i am not doing statistical mechanics ( which would be the full quantum theory ) of spacetime but only thermodynamics . to answer issues related to singularities etc .",
    ", one actually needs to discover the statistical mechanics underlying the thermodynamic description i have presented here .",
    "we can have another chat , after i figure out the statistical mechanics of the spacetime microstructure !",
