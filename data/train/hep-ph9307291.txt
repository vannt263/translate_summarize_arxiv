    "in recent years there has been a continuous interest in the study of mesons built of one heavy and one light quark .",
    "this interest is fuelled by a constant flow of new experimental data and the results of lattice calculations .",
    "the main theoretical achievement in the past few years was the development of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet , see @xcite for reviews ) , which provides one with a systematic tool for the study of the heavy quark limit @xmath1 and for the classification of corrections which are suppressed by powers of the heavy quark mass .",
    "physical applications of this approach include various decays of charm and beauty mesons , for which the preasymptotical corrections @xmath2 are likely to be significant .",
    "considerable effort has been made in the past two years to estimate them , see e.g.  @xcite , but this task is far from being completed yet .",
    "the lagrangian density , written in terms of the effective heavy quark fields , contains to @xmath3 accuracy two additional contributions @xcite apart from the leading one .",
    "they are related in an obvious way to the non  relativistic kinetic energy operator , and to the pauli term , describing the chromomagnetic interaction .",
    "matrix elements of these two operators over meson states are fundamental observables in the heavy quark effective theory , and determine the next  to  leading order corrections to the meson masses suppressed by powers of the quark mass .",
    "the matrix element of the chromomagnetic interaction operator is a leading contribution to the mass splitting between vector and pseudoscalar mesons , and can be directly related to the data on the meson spectrum .",
    "the matrix element of the kinetic energy operator contains information about the smearing in heavy quark momentum , which is important in many applications and contributes , e.g. , to subleading form factors of semileptonic decays @xcite , and recently was shown to give a significant contribution to the electron spectrum in inclusive b  decays @xcite .    up to now ,",
    "there exist no quantitative estimates for the kinetic energy of the heavy quark , except for a single attempt in @xcite .",
    "this task proves to be difficult for lattice qcd , because of power divergences which need to be subtracted , see e.g. @xcite . in this paper",
    "we calculate the kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic mass splitting using the qcd sum rule approach @xcite , including radiative corrections .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows .",
    "is introductory , and contains a short discussion of the heavy quark effective theory , giving necessary definitions and notations .",
    "some results of more technical nature are given in .",
    "the qcd sum rules for the relevant three  point functions in the effective theory are derived in .",
    "contains our main result , namely the sum rule for the matrix element of the kinetic energy operator , including two  loop radiative corrections and renormalization group improvement to two  loop accuracy .",
    "details of the calculation are given in and [ app : b ] .",
    "finally , in we give the summary and conclusions .",
    "the dynamics of hadrons containing both light and heavy quarks can be described by an effective field theory , in which the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out , and the resulting effective lagrangian is expanded in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass .",
    "following @xcite we introduce the heavy quark effective field @xmath4 as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the projector on the upper components of the heavy quark field @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the heavy quark mass , and @xmath9 its four  velocity .",
    "the contributions of lower components of the q ",
    "quark field are integrated out , producing an effective theory with the lagrangian density @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the operator of the non  relativistic kinetic energy , and @xmath12 is the pauli term .",
    "the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath13 . in ( [ kinetic ] ) we have introduced projectors on the directions orthogonal to the velocity @xmath14 : @xmath15    the operator of the chromomagnetic interaction has a non  trivial anomalous dimension , and the coefficient in front of it receives corrections of higher orders in the coupling constant , @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast to this , the kinetic energy operator has zero anomalous dimension to all orders , and its coefficient is exactly one , cf .  @xcite .",
    "this property follows from a residual symmetry of the effective theory under non ",
    "relativistic boosts , and is related to the fact that the kinetic energy term in the non  relativistic hamiltonian is invariant under these transformations .",

    "it has received a lot of attention recently , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the chromomagnetic interaction determines the splitting between pseudoscalar and vector mesons : @xmath46 the relation ( [ mascor ] ) can be derived in a variety of ways and is widely known @xcite .",
    "one possibility is , e.g. , to consider the @xmath43 expansion of suitable two  point correlation functions in qcd near the particle  type singularity , corresponding to the lowest  lying meson state , cf ..",
    "the aim of this paper is to obtain quantitative estimates of the matrix elements @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we use the method of qcd sum rules , see the book @xcite , which we apply directly to suitable correlation functions in hqet .",
    "in particular , we consider the following three  point correlation functions at zero  recoil : @xmath49 @xmath50    saturating the three  point functions with hadron states , one can isolate the contribution of interest as the one having poles in both the variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 at the value @xmath53 : @xmath54 where the scale @xmath18 is the normalization point of the currents , and @xmath55 is the coupling ( squared ) of the effective current to the lowest  lying meson state , defined in ( [ fhql ] ) .",
    "this coupling , in turn , can be obtained as the residue of the pole at @xmath56 in the two  point correlation function @xmath57 @xmath58 to derive eqs .",
    "( [ poles ] ) and ( [ cf2 ] ) , the following relation is useful @xcite : @xmath59 for example , for the lowest  lying meson contribution to the correlation function @xmath60 , one obtains @xmath61 which is the result given in ( [ cf2 ] ) .    the correlation functions @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath62 , and @xmath63 can be calculated in the euclidian region , for negative @xmath64 , and receive contributions from perturbation theory and from vacuum condensates .",
    "the results can be written in form of ( double ) dispersion relations , @xmath65 where the spectral densities are subject to direct calculation in hqet : @xmath66 the relevant feynman diagrams , which contribute to the three ",
    "point correlation functions to first order in @xmath67 , are shown in for the chromomagnetic operator , and in for the kinetic energy ( up to dimension 4 ) .",
    "the graphs missing there turn out to be vanishing .",
    "note that the leading contributions to the correlation function @xmath68 , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , are of @xmath69 . on the contrary ,",
    "the leading perturbative contribution to the kinetic energy is of order @xmath70 , see fig .",
    "2(a ) .    in this section",
    ", we consider the sum rule for the chromomagnetic mass splitting , taking into account the set of diagrams in fig .  1 , and the leading order sum rule for the kinetic energy , taking into account the perturbative contribution in fig .",
    "2(a ) and the leading non  perturbative correction , which in this case is due to the mixed quark ",
    "gluon condensate .",
    "the contribution to the kinetic energy of the quark condensate is of @xmath69 .",
    "the full sum rule for the kinetic energy , with account for all the contributions in figs .",
    "2 , 3 , and 4 and with renormalization group improvement to two  loop accuracy , is considered in detail in the next section .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields : @xmath71 following the usual strategy of the qcd sum rule approach , we apply a borel transformation to the correlation functions in both the external momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath72 the transformation @xmath73 introduces the borel parameter @xmath74 instead of the external momenta .",
    "we next equate the representations of the correlation functions in terms of hadronic states , eqs .",
    "( [ poles ] ) and ( [ cf2 ] ) , and in terms of spectral densities , eqs .",
    "( [ disp ] ) and ( [ spectr ] ) . in the latter we constrain the region of integration to the interval of duality @xmath75 . due to the symmetry of the correlation functions ,",
    "it is natural to take the two borel parameters in the three  point functions equal to each other , @xmath76 .",
    "the normalization of the isgur  wise function at zero recoil @xcite , further requires that the value of the borel parameter in the three  point function takes twice the value as in the two  point function , @xmath77 , and that the values of the continuum threshold @xmath78 in the sum rules for two and three  point functions coincide .",
    "we end up with the set of sum rules plane .",
    "its size is fixed by the continuum threshold in the corresponding two  point sum rule .",
    "our sum rules are not sensitive to the detailed shape of the duality region near the diagonal , which is different from the situation considered in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath79 the normalization scale @xmath18 should be taken to be of order of the typical borel parameter .",
    "the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath78 , as well as the `` working region '' in the borel parameter @xmath74 are determined from the two  point sum rule for @xmath80 , and the sum rules for @xmath47 and @xmath48 do not contain free parameters . in practice , it turns out to be convenient to consider the ratio of three  point and two  point sum rules , which suppresses significantly all the sources of uncertainties . adding a factor 4 ( cf .",
    "( [ splitting ] ) ) and taking into account the scale dependence , we obtain the following sum rule for the mass splitting between vector and pseudoscalar mesons : @xmath81 in the spectral functions , the renormalization scale is @xmath82 .",
    "a similar ratio determines the kinetic energy @xmath47 of the heavy quark : @xmath83 note that the explicit dependence on @xmath45 has cancelled out .",
    "it is , however , present implicitly since the values of @xmath78 and @xmath45 are correlated .",
    "in the numerical calculations we use the following standard values of the vacuum condensates ( at the normalization point 1 gev ) : @xmath84 in this section we use the one  loop expression for the running coupling with @xmath85 and four active flavors .",
    "the corresponding values of the coupling are @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . for definiteness ,",
    "we give values of the decay constant and the chromomagnetic splitting normalized at the scale of the b  meson mass .",
    "the sum rule for the two  point function is most stable for the value @xmath88 and @xmath89 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) .",
    "the stability region starts already at values of the borel parameter of order , and stretches practically to @xmath90 .",
    "it is known , however , that stability at large values of the borel parameter is not informative , since in this region the sum rule is very strongly affected by the continuum model .",
    "the usual criterium that both the higher order power corrections and the contribution of the continuum should not be very large ( say , less than ( 3050)% ) , restricts the working region considerably . in the particular case of the decay",
    "constant @xmath34 one usually chooses @xmath91 @xcite . in the case of the three  point functions ,",
    "the sum rules are especially strongly affected by the subtraction of the continuum owing to the high dimension of the spectral densities .",
    "thus , it is especially difficult in this case to ensure that the continuum contribution is sufficiently small , and this requirement forces one to work in a rather narrow region of the borel parameter , close to the lowest possible value @xmath92 .",
    "this strategy is backed up by considerable experience of qcd sum rule calculations of higher  twist operators built of light quarks , see e.g. @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take the working window in the borel parameter for the three  point functions ( [ cfk ] ) and ( [ cfs ] ) to be @xmath93 .",
    "we emphasize that this region should be fixed by considering the two  point function , and does not necessarily coincide with the stability plateau for three  point sum rules .",
    "the remaining instability should be considered as a part of the errors involved in the calculation .    in fig .",

    "the sensitivity of the sum rules to the change of @xmath78 and of the borel parameter ( within the working region which is shown as shaded area ) gives a conservative estimate for the accuracy of the results .",
    "we end up with the values @xmath94 the given value of the mass splitting between vector and pseudoscalar mesons is our final result whereas the analysis of @xmath47 will be extended to next  to  leading order in the next section ( the superscript `` lo '' stands for `` leading  order '' result ) .",
    "the experimental values for the mass splitting in beautiful and charmed mesons are @xcite @xmath95 these values are close to each other which indicates the smallness of higher order corrections .",
    "the measured splittings agree quite well with our result in ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "in this section we calculate the @xmath69 corrections to the sum rule for the kinetic energy .",
    "this calculation is laborious , but worthwhile , since in the case of the coupling @xmath97 the radiative corrections proved to be very large , see @xcite .",
