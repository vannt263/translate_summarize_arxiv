    "large transverse momentum phenomena in deep inelastic scattering reactions have been extensively studied by the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera .",
    "large-@xmath7 particle and jet spectra have been measured and compared to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations .",
    "large-@xmath7 photons have also been observed , in an inclusive way @xcite or in correlation with a hadronic jet @xcite .",
    "this latter reaction has been the subject of theoretical studies some ten years ago @xcite .",
    "the recent data from zeus  @xcite lead us to extend these studies and to compare the complete nlo qcd results with the @xmath8-jet cross sections .    in principle , prompt photon production in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) is a very simple process  : it goes via the compton scattering of a virtual photon on a quark : @xmath9 and requires only the knowledge of the distribution function of a quark in the proton . including higher - order ( ho ) corrections",
    "considerably complicates the picture and new objects have to be introduced .",
    "for example , in the scattering @xmath10 , the @xmath11 pair may be produced quasi - collinearly to the virtual photon , one of the parton in the pair being then scattered at large @xmath12 : this configuration generates the virtual photon structure function ( resolved photon ) at lowest order associated to a large logarithm .",
    "it is then necessary to resum such large logarithms and introduce the all order photon structure function .",
    "furthermore , in the above process or in @xmath13 , the final photon may be produced collinearly to a final state quark or antiquark ( bremsstrahlung ) leading to a large logarithmic enhancement , thus generating the photon fragmentation fonction .",
    "thus one is lead to distinguish four types of processes , all contributing already at leading order ( lo ) : the direct - direct ( d - d ) one where both the virtual photon and the final real photon couple directly to the hard sub - process ; the resolved - direct ( r - d ) where the virtual photon couples to the hard subprocess through its hadronic ( perturbative or non perturbative ) components ; the direct - fragmented ( d - f ) and the resolved - fragmented ( r - f ) ones where the final photon appears as a fragment of a jet unlike in the previous two cases where it is isolated . at hera ,",
    "all four processes corresponding to four topologies have essentially the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "however when dealing with isolated photon , the isolation criteria necessary to suppress the background from @xmath14 , considerably reduces the fragmentation components d - f and r - f .",
    "the above discussion on the four topologies is valid as long as we can define a virtual photon structure function resumming all the large logarithms @xmath15 @xcite where @xmath7 is a characteristic transverse momentum of the reaction ( for instance that of the observed photon in the proton virtual - photon center - of - mass frame ) and @xmath16 the initial photon virtuality .",
    "these terms appear in the calculation of ho corrections to the born direct cross sections .",
    "if @xmath7 is not large enough ( @xmath17 ) it is of course not useful to subtract these logarithms from the direct ho corrections in order to resum them in the virtual photon structure function . on the other hand for @xmath18",
    "this approach is useful  : indeed in this case the resolved cross sections have the same structure as a hadronic cross section involving two parton distributions convoluted with hard subprocesses .",
    "ho corrections are known , they are large and can be easily implemented .    the natural frame to observe large-@xmath7 phenomena and to calculate the corresponding nlo cross section in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) is the proton virtual - photon center - of - mass system ( hadronic frame or cm@xmath0 ) .",
    "the large @xmath19 of the final photon provides the scale which can be compared with the photon virtuality ; a large ratio @xmath20 defines the kinematical range in which the photon structure function formalism is useful .",
    "such an approach , but without the introduction of the virtual photon structure function , can be found in @xcite .",
    "it contains detailed studies on the jet algorithms and the scale choice dependence of the cross sections .",
    "as the kinematical conditions are often specified in the laboratory frame and as a large-@xmath7 in the laboratory does not necessarily implies a large @xmath19 in the cm@xmath0 , a lower limit @xmath21 can also be imposed by the experiments .",
    "this condition will preserve the validity of a perturbative calculation and the possibility to define a virtual photon structure function .",
    "the production of jets and of forward @xmath22 has been measured with this convention by h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "several experiments have also used the laboratory frame ( lab frame ) to present their results @xcite without imposing the requirement @xmath23 . as we shall see , the approach involving the definition of the resolved cross section is not always under control , and we have to content ourselves with the calculations of unsubtracted direct contribution .",
    "thus we loose the possibility to supplement them with ho corrections .    in this paper",
    "we consider dis reactions in which an isolated photon and a jet are observed in the final state , extending the approach used in the inclusive case @xcite with only a photon observed in the final state .",
    "we discuss both cases , when the transverse momenta are defined in the cm@xmath0 or in the lab frames .",
    "this study is triggered by recent detailed zeus results @xcite .",
    "unfortunately no @xmath19 constraint has been introduced by this collaboration , thus forbidding , in some kinematical domains , direct comparisons with complete nlo predictions .",
    "the comparison with inclusive isolated cross section done in our previous paper was favored by the h1 kinematics @xcite having a large domain where the condition @xmath24 with @xmath25 was verified .",
    "the situation is less favorable with the zeus kinematics having a larger range in @xmath16 .",
    "the observation of a photon and a jet in the laboratory does not necessarily imply a large invariant mass squared @xmath26 of this system ( when the photon and the jet are almost parallel ) .",
    "therefore the addition of a jet is not sufficient to prevent configuration with @xmath27 .",
    "this fact leads us to introduce a cut - off @xmath28 in our calculations and to study the stability of our results when @xmath28 goes to zero .",
    "if , in some kinematical domains , the results are not sensitive to @xmath28 we will compare them with zeus data .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following .",
    "the next section is devoted to the calculation of the gamma - jet cross section in the cm@xmath0 . by this",
    "we mean that the isolation algorithm for the photon and jet algorithm are defined in this frame .",
    "the jet algorithm also contains conditions such as `` jet of highest @xmath7 '' in the cm@xmath0 . as we fix the kinematical variable @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the laboratory we require the condition @xmath31 .",
    "we discuss in detail the introduction of the resolved component .",
    "the four contributions ( d - d , d - f ,",
    "r - d and r - f ) are calculated and their respective importance is discussed .",
    "then , in section 3 , we discuss calculations performed in the laboratory frame . by this",
    "we mean that the isolation algorithm and jet algorithm are now defined in the laboratory where the kinematical boundaries are also fixed .",
    "we furthermore study the differences between the standard cone algorithm and the democratic one for the photon isolation and for the jet definition .",
    "we have to introduce a cut - off @xmath28 in order to avoid possible instability of the cross section .",
    "finally section 4 is devoted to the comparison with the recent zeus data  @xcite .",
    "in this section , devoted to calculations in the cm@xmath0 , we study the four contributions to the @xmath8-jet cross section discussed in the introduction .",
    "such a frame looks like the laboratory frame of a hadronic collider ; the colliding particles have collinear trajectories and the large transverse momentum @xmath19 of the observed final particle fixes the large scale appearing in the distribution functions and in the strong coupling constant .",
    "however to be close to the experimental conditions we impose constraints on the observed kinematical variables , transverse momenta and rapidity , in the laboratory frame .",
    "the particle momenta are transformed to the cm@xmath0 frame in which we define the isolation algorithm and the jet algorithm .",
    "as discussed in the introduction we impose a cut on the photon momentum @xmath31 in order to avoid instabilities of the cross section and to guarantee the validity of the perturbative regime . in this section",
    "we use the cone algorithm @xcite for the isolation and the longitudinal @xmath32-algorithm @xcite to define a jet .",
    "when two jets are present , we observe the jet of higher @xmath33 .",
    "for the photon the radius of the isolation cone is @xmath34 and we require a ratio @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the hadronic energy contained in the isolation cone . for the jet the radius @xmath37 of the @xmath32-algorithm",
    "is set equal to @xmath38 .",
    "another algorithm , the so - called democratic algorithm will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "we use the cteq6 m proton structure @xcite and the virtual photon structure function presented in ref .",

    "constraints on the final electron are  : @xmath50  gev , @xmath51 ( the @xmath52 axis is pointing toward the proton direction ) .",
    "finally the photon virtuality is @xmath53  gev@xmath4 .",
    "the numerical calculations are carried out using the adaptative monte carlo code basis  @xcite .      in the d - d contribution",
    "the real and virtual photons are directly coupled to the hard subprocess and the born term , @xmath54 , is particularly simple : it consists of the compton scattering diagrams .",
    "the cross section has a @xmath55 behavior when the photon is emitted close to the forward direction ( collinear to the initial quark ) and a @xmath56 behavior when it is emitted collinear to the final quark . in the cm@xmath0 the divergent configurations , in @xmath57 or @xmath58 , are forbidden by the requirement @xmath59 .",
    "real ho corrections to the born term are given by amplitudes involving an extra gluon coupled to the quark line .",
    "when this gluon is collinear to the initial quark the cross section is divergent .",
    "this divergence is subtracted and absorbed in the quark distribution .",
    "when this gluon is emitted at large @xmath19 , the initial virtual photon can produce a collinear quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this is the origin of the virtual photon structure function .",
    "after integration on the final quark phase space one gets the expression @xmath60 where the symbol @xmath61 indicates a convolution between the born cross section and the antiquark distribution in the virtual photon - dependent factors in the logarithm argument are not indicated .",
    "they are discussed in ref .",

    "we subtract @xmath66 from the d - d ho term thus defining the ho@xmath67 corrections .",
    "the subtracted term builds , through the inhomogeneous dglap evolution equation , the resummed structure function @xmath68 @xcite , the basis of the resolved contributions .",
    "we choose @xmath69 so that the structure function vanishes when @xmath70 , and is proportional to @xmath71 for @xmath65 .",
    "some numerical results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ygam - dir - cm ] for the cross section @xmath72 with the cut @xmath73  gev .",

    "as expected the cross section is largest in the forward direction due to the dominance of the @xmath76 term in the scattering amplitude .",
    "we notice that the ho@xmath77 corrections are negative , as already observed in the inclusive case @xcite . on the contrary , the unsubtracted ho corrections are close to zero , the difference ho - ho@xmath77 being the contribution of the lowest order resolved term that will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "in fact , the nlo unsubtracted result can not be distinguished from the d - d lo curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ygam - dir - cm ] . the results in that figure strongly",
    "depend on the value of the cut - off @xmath28 .",
    "this point is illustrated in table 1 where the total @xmath39 cross section is displayed .",
    "we consider two domains in @xmath16 .",
    "we see that for low value of @xmath16 the nlo cross section is stable with respect to the @xmath28 value while it is not the case when considering the whole @xmath16 range . in the former case , the lorentz boost between the laboratory and the cm@xmath0 frames , @xmath78 with @xmath79 the usual dis variable ( scaled virtual - photon energy in the laboratory ) , is small and @xmath80 remains relatively large , and close to its @xmath81 value in the laboratory , so that the cross section is insensitive to the cut - off . on the contrary for large values of @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath80 may reach small values where perturbation theory is not reliable ( very large ho corrections ) and where the theoretical predictions become sensitive to the cut - off .",
    "the errors associated to the nlo cross sections are the values resulting from the monte - carlo integration procedure ( for the born cross sections the errors are at the per - mil level ) .",
    ".__variation of the d - d @xmath8-jet cross section in pbarns with @xmath28 in two @xmath16 ranges .",
    "the isolation and jet criteria are implemented in the cm@xmath0 . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     however we note that this dependence is weaker when @xmath82  gev@xmath4 . with this kinematical requirement",
    "we obtain a more stable cross section .    the r - d contribution at nlo ( long - dash - dotted line ) to the cross section @xmath83",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ygam - res - lab ] for @xmath73  gev : it has the same features as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ygam - res - cm * ] , namely very slightly decreasing with @xmath84 and one finds large ho corrections throughout the whole range ( about a factor 2 ) .      the @xmath75 distribution of the d - f component , with @xmath73 gev , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ygam - res - lab ] .",
    "it is essentially flat and rather small , the same features as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ygam - res - cm * ] .",
    "the ho contribution is roughly independent of @xmath75 and doubles the born term .",
    "the distribution is relatively stable under the @xmath85 parameter : if taken to zero the d - f component is 13% larger in the backward bin decreasing to no variation in the most forward bin .",
    "we have in the r - f ho contribution a piece similar to that in the r - d ho one . a large-@xmath7 parton ( in the lab )",
    "can be emitted collinearly with an initial parton in the resolved virtual photon and then fragments into a photon .",
    "again this corresponds to a collinear configuration in the cm@xmath0 frame that we cut by the requirement @xmath86 .",
    "therefore this contribution has a strong dependence on this cut - off parameter .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ygam - res - lab ] it is the smallest of all four components and will give a negligible contribution to the full isolated @xmath8-jet cross section .",
    "after this lengthy discussion on each of the components which build the @xmath8-jet cross section we are now ready to compare the nlo calculation to the most recent zeus data .",
    "it is worth stressing that only the sum of all            four components have a physical meaning and can be compared to data as the relative weight of each component depends on the unphysical scales .",
    "it has been stressed above that measuring the transverse components in the laboratory frame rather than the cm@xmath0 frame does not garantee the perturbative stability of the calculation : indeed it appears from the above discussion that , if the direct components are rather stable under the @xmath87 parameter , this is not the case for the resolved ones because the zeus phase space does not garantee that the cm@xmath0 momenta in the hard subprocesses remain large and also does not eliminate all the collinear singularities associated to the photon radiation from a quark at large laboratory transverse momentum . for these reasons we will bracket the theoretical predictions     distribution : comparison of the full nlo calculation to zeus data @xcite .",
    "the leptonic contribution is as quoted in @xcite . _ _ ]    by two cross sections : one obtained with @xmath88 gev , which garantees the perturbative stability but excludes some @xmath8-jet configurations included in the data , the other with @xmath89 gev which accounts for a larger phase space at the cost of letting the theoretical predictions err in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "the results of our approach are compared with data in figs .",
    "[ fig : ygam - zeus - lab]-[fig : ptjet - zeus - nores - lab ] . in all plots",
    "we include the contribution from the leptonic radiation of the photon ( @xmath90 ) based on the djangoh  @xcite generator , as estimated in @xcite .",
    "we add it to the hadronic results obtained in this work , with a numerical accuracy of better than 2% , to obtain cross sections comparable to the data .",
    "the interference contribution between leptonic and hadronic emissions is negligible  @xcite .",
    "furthermore no hadronization corrections are applied to our estimates .",
    "[ fig : ygam - zeus - lab ] we display the photon rapidity spectrum and we note the very good agreement with the data when the cutoff @xmath88 gev is selected . using the lower cut - off uniformely increases the predictions by about 12% .",

    "the interesting feature however is that both cut - offs lead to similar results in the high @xmath91 tail where we expect the nlo resummed treatment of the resolved component to be most appropriate ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "there , our predictions can be taken as solid predictions from nlo perturbative qcd as all relevant scales are large in the cm@xmath0 frame . comparing to the estimates based on @xcite and quoted in",
    "@xcite we are above  : in fact they systematically underestimate the data while still being compatible with them at large @xmath91 .",
    "+ turning to the @xmath16 distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2-zeus - lab ] , our results confirm the discussion above : excellent agreement and stability under a change of the cut - off at small @xmath16 , overestimate of the data at the larger values .",
    "finally we conclude this phenomenological discussion with the @xmath93 spectrum , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptjet - zeus - lab ] , where we notice a small excess in the predictions for the smallest two bins , @xmath94 gev , with a large instability under change of cut - off in the first bin . in relation with this observation one",
    "notes a large higher correction ( up to a factor 2 compared to the born term ) to the resolved component .",
    "the origin of this is the fact that the collinear fragments of the virtual photon , which would be rejected by a cut - off in the cm@xmath0 frame can be seen as jets in the laboratory .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath95  gev we observe good agreement with data as well as a very good stability under change of the cut - off which indicates that nlo perturbation theory is valid . to further explore the small @xmath93 regime",
    "we calculate the cross section without resummation on the resolved component ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ptjet - zeus - nores - lab ] )  : agreement with data is achieved for the first two bins while above 6 gev the cross section is systematically underestimated . a last remark concerning the comparison between theory and experiment at small",
    "@xmath12 is of a more practical nature  : the theoretical jets constructed at the partonic level are compared with the experimental ones at the hadronic level and hadronization corrections not taken into account at nlo qcd must be important .",
    "we have discussed at length the full nlo qcd predictions for @xmath8-jet final states in deep - inelastic scattering at hera and compared with zeus data where transverse momenta are defined in the laboratory frame .",
    "the motivation for studying these final states is to avoid the photon - quark final state collinear singularity present in the born term @xmath96 when the photon , produced longitudinally in the cm@xmath0 frame , is detected at large transverse momentum in the laboratory frame due to the transverse boost of the virtual photon .",
    "we have seen that the full nlo qcd calculation , taking into account the ho corrections to the resummed resolved component , again hits this collinear singularity problem which occurs in the large @xmath16 , low @xmath91 or @xmath93 regions .",
    "so , in deep inelastic scattering , doing large @xmath12 phenomenology with momenta defined in the laboratory is not enough to cure this collinear problem since it re - enters through the back door when considering higher order diagrams as are needed for precision calculations . of course , working with cm@xmath0 coordinates , or with a cut - off in the cm@xmath0 frame",
    ", one would not have encountered this difficulty .",
    "nevertheless , in some well identified kinematical regions in the laboratory ( low @xmath16 or large @xmath12 ) comparaison between experiment and the full nlo theory is astonishingly good unlike the case when considering partial nlo calculation where the resolved component is treated at lowest order .",
    "of course further data involving a cut in the cm@xmath0 frame should permit a sounder comparison between theory and experiment . to be complete",
    "a study of the scale dependence of the theoretical estimates should have been done .",
    "however in view of the problems discussed above this is not justified at this stage .",
    "it is enough to remember that the choice of scales used in this work ( @xmath97 ) gave very good agreement with data for related processes , namely @xmath22 production in dis  @xcite and photoproduction ( @xmath98 ) of isolated photons  @xcite ( see @xcite for the theoretical discussion ) . in this respect ,",
    "we are not as pessimistic as the authors of @xcite who observe , based on comparison of older data with previous theoretical calculations , that isolated photon production both in dis and photoproduction is underestimated in the nlo qcd approach .",
    "we would like to thank peter bussey for carefully reading the manuscript and for his useful remark on the @xmath99 spectrum .",
