    "recent precision data on the @xmath2 structure function in the resonance region from jefferson lab  @xcite , as well as the spin asymmetry ( @xmath5 ) data in the resonance region from hermes  @xcite , have significantly renewed the interest  @xcite for local quark - hadron duality ( local duality )  @xcite . before the advent of qcd ,",
    "it was empirically observed by bloom and gilman  @xcite that the nucleon structure function in the resonance region , @xmath6 , was approximately equal to the scaling structure function , @xmath7 , measured in the deep inelastic region .",
    "the relation between the two structure functions was found to be in terms of a finite - energy sum rule .",
    "specifically , it was observed that @xmath6 oscillates around the scaling curve , and its average is equivalent to @xmath7 within a deviation of @xmath8 % .",
    "the qcd justification for the bloom and gilman observation , named local duality , was made by de rjula , georgi , and politzer  @xcite .",
    "more recent theoretical studies of local duality and qcd also have been made  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the european muon collaboration ( emc ) effect  @xcite shows that the parton distributions in nuclei ( bound nucleon ) are different from those in a free nucleon .",
    "basically , there happens a depletion of the structure function at intermediate and larger bjorken-@xmath0 ( @xmath9 ) , while a steep rise at large bjorken-@xmath0 .",
    "it was concluded by miller and smith  @xcite that the depletion of the deep inelastic nuclear structure functions observed in the valence quark regime , is due to some effect beyond the conventional nucleon - meson treatment of nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "we note that for the region of @xmath10 short - range correlations as well as the nuclear binding effects become important  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental data from jefferson lab  @xcite for ratios of the nuclear to deuterium cross sections in the resonance region , revealed a similar effect as that observed in the emc effect .",
    "because the resonance structure functions average better in nuclei due to fermi motion and nuclear many - body effects  @xcite , we expect that local duality is realized better in nuclei , although a proper treatment of resonances in nuclei must be investigated .",
    "thus , local duality may potentially be one of the other new methods to study the nuclear structure functions at large bjorken-@xmath0 .",
    "complementary , the measurements of electromagnetic form factors of bound protons in polarized ( @xmath11 ) scattering on @xmath12he at mami and jefferson lab  @xcite , concluded that the ratio of the electric ( @xmath13 ) to magnetic ( @xmath14 ) sachs proton form factors differs by @xmath8 % in @xmath12he from that in @xmath15h .",
    "this strongly suggests that the internal structure of a bound proton ( nucleon ) is modified in nuclei . in their analyses , conventional models employing free proton form factors , phenomenological optical potentials , and bound state wave functions , as well as relativistic corrections , meson exchange currents , isobar contributions and final state interactions  @xcite ,",
    "all fail to account for the observed effect in @xmath12he  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a better agreement with the data was obtained only when , in addition to these standard nuclear - structure corrections , a correction due to the internal structure change of a bound proton in @xmath12he was taken into account  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of such attempts was made to extract the bound nucleon ( nuclear ) structure function @xmath2 at large bjorken-@xmath0 .    in this letter",
    ", we extend the study of ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate also other bound nucleon structure functions for both charged - lepton and ( anti)neutrino scattering based on local duality .",
    "in particular , we focus on the effect of the bound nucleon internal structure change on the nuclear structure functions .",
    "however , one of the important , conventional nuclear effects , fermi motion , will be included in a simple fermi gas model .",
    "we convolute the structure functions with the nucleon momentum distribution obtained in a fermi gas model , for _ both _ the structure functions extracted using the free and bound nucleon form factors , and then calculate ratios .",
    "( to draw more solid conclusions , we need to perform an elaborated study including the nuclear effects .",
    "we plan to study the effects of binding etc . in the framework of local quark - hadron duality  @xcite . ) in addition , we consider charge symmetry breaking in parton distributions in nuclei using the structure functions calculated .",
    "for this purpose we use the bound nucleon form factors calculated  @xcite in the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite , which has been successfully applied to many problems of nuclear and hadronic physics  @xcite .",
    "since , in the present study , we want to see the effect of the bound nucleon internal structure change included entirely in the bound nucleon form factors and the pion threshold in a nuclear medium , the elastic contribution to the bound nucleon structure functions for charged - lepton scattering may be given by  @xcite : @xmath16 \\delta(x-1 ) , \\label{f_2bn } \\\\",

    "thus , we conclude that , the enhancement of the bound nucleon structure functions @xmath57 and @xmath64 in the charged lepton scattering obtained , is intrinsic and not smeared by the effect of fermi motion .",

    "<S> this implies that a part of the enhancement observed in the nuclear structure function @xmath2 ( in the resonance region ) at large bjorken-@xmath0 ( the emc effect ) is due to the effect of the bound nucleon internal structure change . however , the @xmath0 dependence for the charged - lepton and ( anti)neutrino scattering is different . </S>",
    "<S> the former [ latter ] is enhanced [ quenched ] in the region </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 [ @xmath4 due to the difference of the contribution from axial vector form factor . </S>",
    "<S> because of these differences charge symmetry breaking in parton distributions will be enhanced in nuclei .    </S>",
