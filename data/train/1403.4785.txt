    "low temperature phase transitions in condensed matter systems are usually driven by the cooperative actions of the system s electronic degrees of freedom . in many cases the exchange interactions between the spins of electrons on neighbouring ions",
    "causes them to order below a characteristic transition temperature .",
    "however , in lanthanide compounds , the localised @xmath1-electrons on each ionic site may have non - spherical charge or current distributions , which may be described by a multipole expansion of their electric or magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "these multipoles may interact , and in certain cases these interactions may be stronger than the spin exchange interactions , driving a phase transition to a multipolar ordered phase . there have been many examples of electric quadurpolar order observed , such as in ceb@xmath2  @xcite , prpb@xmath0  @xcite , and tmte  @xcite , whilst higher order electric multipoles were observed in dyb@xmath3c@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the lanthanides , there have not been many cases of multipolar order observed in actinide compounds .",
    "this is due partly to the larger spatial extent of the @xmath4 wavefunctions , which causes them to become delocalised , and hence invalidates any description of their electric or magnetic fields about a particular point .",
    "the insulating actinide oxides uo@xmath3 and npo@xmath3 , however , have been studied extensively , and exhibit electric quadrupolar and high order magnetic multipolar order respectively  @xcite .",
    "in contrast upd@xmath0 is one of the few metallic actinide compounds which has well localised @xmath4 electrons , and it was one of the first compounds to be shown to exhibit quadrupolar ordering .",
    "anomalies were observed in the heat capacity  @xcite , thermal expansion  @xcite , magnetic susceptibility  @xcite and electrical resistivity  @xcite of upd@xmath0 at low temperatures which are indicative of phase transitions .",
    "polarised neutron diffraction measurements revealed superlattice peaks at @xmath5 which appear only in the non - spin - flip channel , and thus can be attributed to a structural transition  @xcite , from hexagonal to orthorhombic symmetry .",
    "x - ray resonant scattering ( xrs ) measurements  @xcite showed that this transition arises from the ordering of the electric quadrupole moment of the 5@xmath6 electrons .",
    "in addition to this phase transition at @xmath7  k , there are three further transitions to different antiferroquadrupolar ( afq ) ordered states at @xmath8  k , @xmath9  k and @xmath10  k. below @xmath11 a superlattice peak at @xmath12 where @xmath13 is odd is observed , whilst below @xmath14 there are additional peaks at @xmath12 where @xmath13 is even .",
    "the @xmath13 odd peaks show that there is antiferroquadrupolar ordering along the @xmath15-direction , also denoted as an anti - phase stacking of quadrupoles .",
    "the @xmath13 even peaks show an additional ordering of quadrupole moments in - phase along @xmath15 .",
    "measurements of the order parameter using x - ray resonant scattering show that the @xmath13 odd order is associated mainly with @xmath16 quadrupoles  @xcite , whilst the @xmath13 even order is associated with @xmath17 quadrupoles  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 ordering is accompanied by a component from the @xmath18 quadrupoles , whilst the @xmath17 is accompanied by a @xmath19 component .",
    "the directions @xmath20 and @xmath21 are equivalent to the @xmath22 and @xmath15 crystallographic directions and @xmath23 is perpendicular to both . in addition , there is also an additional ordering of the @xmath19 quadrupoles in anti - phase below @xmath24 .",
    "this sequence of phase transitions is summarised in figure  [ fg : ordertemps ] .",
    "upd@xmath0 adopts the double hexagonal close packed tini@xmath0 crystal structure ( space group @xmath25 , @xmath26 , no .",
    "194 )  @xcite with lattice parameters @xmath27    and @xmath28   .",
    "this means that the nearest neighbour u - u distance , 4.1   , is larger than the hill limit ( @xmath29   )  @xcite and thus the 5@xmath6 electrons are well localised .",
    "the u@xmath30 ions are in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 sites , which have respectively @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) point symmetry which we shall refer to as _ quasi - cubic _ and _ hexagonal_. the xrs data shows that the ordering involves primarily the ions on the quasi - cubic sites  @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the crystal field ( cf ) interactions is essential in determining the more complex two - ion interactions . in particular",
    "it is crucial to know the cf ground state .",
    "moreover , the excited states and the matrix elements of the angular momentum operators , @xmath37 , between these and the ground state determine the intensities of excitations observed by inelastic neutron scattering and also to some extent the magnitude of the magnetisation in the ordered phase , as explained by mcewen et al .",
    "thus we shall first consider in section  [ sec - upd3-cf ] the cf level scheme deduced from inelastic neutron scattering measurements in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "quasi - cubic site crystal field level scheme .",
    "_ the crystal field energy levels and corresponding wavefunctions in the paramagnetic phase expressed in the @xmath38 basis .",
    "arrows denote transitions from the ground state with non - negligible dipole matrix elements whose squared values are shown as numbers near the arrow . ]",
    "we then present high field magnetisation and magnetostriction measurements in section  [ sec - highfield ] , from which the critical fields and magnetic phase diagrams were determined experimentally . finally , a mean field model of the quadrupolar ordering is constructed in section  [ sec - upd3-mfcub ] .",
    "the order parameters of each of the quadrupolar phases ( determined by resonant x - ray scattering ) and their transition temperatures , were used to constrain the two - ion quadrupolar interaction parameters for the model , whilst the dipolar exchange parameters were determined from the measured critical fields .",
    "the results of the model are then compared to the measured high field data .    whilst the model which we shall present",
    "is empirically based on the measured physical properties of upd@xmath0 rather than directly on measured exchange constants , we note that it is the first attempt to explain comprehensively this fascinating compound with its many competing ordered phases from a microscopic point of view , and hope to stimulate further _ ab initio _ studies of the exchange interactions involved .",
    "the quadrupolar interactions which drive the many phase transitions in upd@xmath0 are difficult to measure directly , because neutrons couple only to the magnetic dipoles in the system , and the energies are far too low for inelastic x - ray scattering to resolve .",
    "however , the wealth of physical property measurements available on upd@xmath0 has encouraged us to try to synthesise this into a mean - field model which explains , to a large extent , these varied measurements .",
    "we hope that this may encourage the construction of models to explain the properties of similar quadrupolar ( or higher multipolar ) ordered compounds thus deepening the understanding of what lies behind these phenomena .",
    "the single - ion properties of uranium are generally found to be close to the @xmath39-coupling limit  @xcite .",
    "so , in order to simplify the analysis , we shall ignore any mixing with higher order multiplets in determining the crystal field ( cf ) parameters . as mentioned in section  [ sec - upd3-intro ]",
    ", there are two inequivalent sites for the u@xmath30 ions in the crystal structure of upd@xmath0 .",
    "the different point symmetry of these sites gives rise to different crystal fields , but it happens that both split the 9-fold degenerate @xmath40 ground multiplet into three singlets and three doublets .",
    "the energies and wavefunctions of these levels , however , are different for the two sites .    the nature of the ground state may be deduced from single crystal susceptibility measurements and estimates of the magnetic entropy determined from heat capacity measurements .",
    "these results indicate a singlet ground state on the hexagonal sites and a doublet on the quasi - cubic sites  @xcite .    the cf split energy levels were determined from previously reported inelastic neutron scattering measurements made on the time - of - flight spectrometer het at the isis facility , uk  @xcite , and on the triple - axis - spectrometer in8 at ill , grenoble  @xcite .",
    "we identified magnetic excitations at 4.1 , 9.7 , 12.3 , 16.8 , 20.4 and 30  mev .",
    "the 16  mev peak exhibits considerable dispersion and is assigned to the transition between the @xmath41 singlet ground state and the @xmath42 doublet excited state of the hexagonal site ions .",
    "its dispersion was used to determine the exchange interactions between hexagonal sites  @xcite .",
    "the remaining peaks are assigned to the quasi - cubic site ions .",
    "henceforth we shall be concerned mainly with the quasi - cubic sites , as the quadrupolar ordering primarily involves the uranium ions on these sites .",
    "these sites have trigonal , @xmath34 ( @xmath33 ) , point symmetry , so that the crystal field hamiltonian is    @xmath43    where @xmath44 are crystal field parameters and @xmath45 are stevens operators .",
    "the quantisation ( @xmath21 ) axis is taken to be the trigonal axis , which in this case is parallel to @xmath15 .    from the measured transition energies and with the restriction of a doublet ground state , a crystal field fitting program  @xcite was used to obtain initial estimates of the cf parameters for the quasi - cubic sites .",
    "this program relies on the orthogonality of the spherical harmonic functions from which the cf operators are constructed .",
    "it allows one to find a set of cf parameters , @xmath44 , given the energy levels and wavefunctions produced by the crystal field .",
    "the fitting algorithm may thus vary either the wavefunctions to fit a particular set of energy levels , or vice versa . in this case , however , we also face constraints on the wavefunctions .",
    "._crystal field parameters in stevens normalisation in mev_. the parameters were deduced from fitting to inelastic neutron spectra and the constraints on the wavefunctions of the lowest three energy levels of the quasi - cubic sites as described in the text . [ cols= \" > , < , > , < \" , ]     the calculated magnetostriction fits the data well in the high field regions , but does not reproduce the low field behaviour , particular for the case where the field is applied along @xmath20 .",
    "it may be that at low fields , some of the measured magnetostriction is due to domain rotation , which is not considered in the mean field model .",
    "we have deduced a mean field model including up to four nearest neighbour dipolar exchange and quadrupolar interactions between the 5@xmath6 electrons of upd@xmath0 which is in generally good qualitative agreement with a broad range of experimental results .",
    "the interactions between electrons on the quasi - cubic sites were deduced from resonant x - ray scattering measurements of the quadrupolar order parameters of each of the four low temperature ordered phases , and from the measured transition temperatures and critical fields .",
    "the model was then used to calculate the high field magnetisation and magnetostriction , and the magnetic phase diagram up to 30 t. with an applied magnetic field in the basal plane , the calculations for the @xmath20 and @xmath23 directions agree with the data .",
    "the calculated magnetisation with the field parallel to @xmath21 is a factor of 3 too large , however , and the calculated critical field in this direction is much smaller than that measured . despite this , the @xmath21-direction calculated magnetic phase diagrams qualitatively reproduces that measured . in conclusion ,",
    "we have developed a nearest neighbour mean - field model which reproduces many of the main features observed in upd@xmath0 .",
