    "the detection of extra - terrestrial multi - tev neutrinos would significantly contribute to the understanding of the origin , acceleration and propagation of high energy cosmic rays .",
    "it would also influence the interpretation of results of the most recent gamma ray experiment results , like those of h.e.s.s . @xcite .",
    "neutrinos can propagate through the universe without being affected by interactions or magnetic fields .",
    "therefore they are ideal high energy cosmic messengers and , for the same reason , unfortunately very difficult to detect . even the so called `` guaranteed '' neutrino fluxes ,",
    "i.e. those associated with known cosmic accelerators with an identified pion production target , typically require a @xmath1 km@xmath0 scale detector .",
    "amanda - ii @xcite , with its @xmath2 km@xmath0 instrumented volume , is currently the largest operating neutrino telescope .",
    "its sensitivity is improving because of the larger data sample collected , better apparatus understanding , and more efficient background rejection techniques .",
    "the main background for neutrino telescopes is the intense flux of downward penetrating cosmic muons which can mimic the upward neutrino - induced event signature . a total rejection factor of @xmath3 is required to isolate muons arising from neutrinos created in atmospheric cosmic ray showers .",
    "amanda - ii has improved reconstruction algorithms  @xcite and analysis techniques and currently it is able to select about four upward going muons per day @xcite . after rejecting the downward muon background ,",
    "these atmospheric neutrinos remain as an irreducible background in searches for extraterrestrial neutrino fluxes .",
    "the following sections describe the searches for localized neutrino sources and for a diffuse neutrino flux from many weak sources , respectively .",
    "since the main background consists of downward - going cosmic ray muons , the search for neutrinos is restricted to the northern hemisphere . a point source in the sky",
    "would be identified as a localized significant excess of events , above the irreducible measured atmospheric muon neutrino background .",
    "the event selection is independently performed on different declination bands , for assumed spectra with @xmath4 to @xmath5 energy dependence .",
    "the band width depends on the angular resolution at the given declination .",
    "the optimization of event selection is done by requiring the best sensitivity , i.e. the best 90% cl expected average upper limit in the case of no signal @xcite , at each declination band . the final sample contains 3329 events in the first 807 days of lifetime of amanda - ii ( see fig [ fig : point ] ) , which has an estimated cosmic ray muon background contamination of less than 10% and corresponds to a median angular resolution of @xmath6 , depending of declination .",
    "the sensitivity , for an assumed energy spectrum of @xmath4 , is @xmath7 gev@xmath8s@xmath9 , and it is almost independent on declination @xcite .",
    "no excess with respect to the expected background has been observed so far @xcite .",
    "the absence of a significant excess could simply be caused by the small size of the amanda - ii apparatus and faint neutrino fluxes from the point sources . besides increasing the collected data sample , a possibility for improving",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is to search for events from a pre - selected list of source candidates @xcite , or for events in coincidence with known periods of enhanced electromagnetic emission of selected objects @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to perform a stacking source search using well defined classes of active galactic nuclei , under the assumption that neutrino emission is similar to the electromagnetic one @xcite .",
    "with respect to the single point source candidate search the stacking analysis achieves @xmath1 2 - 3 times better sensitivity for some of the selected source classes .",
    "searches for neutrinos in coincidence with gamma ray bursts were also performed  @xcite , where the time constraint significantly reduces the background contamination , but no signal was found .",
    "the search for high energy neutrinos from all the possible sources in the universe emitted throughout its evolution could enhance a very faint signal not detectable from single sources .",
    "the search for a diffuse neutrino flux relies on the simulation of the background and the signal - to - noise optimization is performed on the energy estimation of the selected events .",
    "it is expected that neutrinos have a hard energy spectrum proportional to @xmath4 , whereas the atmospheric neutrinos have a steeper spectrum ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "therefore , after having assured the quality of selected events , an energy cut is optimized to have the best sensitivity .",
    "the preliminary sensitivity for the search of diffuse muon neutrinos is @xmath11 gev@xmath8s@xmath9sr@xmath9 for 807 days of livetime , in the energy range between 13 tev and 3.2 pev .",
    "this preliminary search did not reveal any significant excess with respect to the background .",
    "a search for all neutrino flavor events undergoing neutral current interaction as well was also performed .",
    "reconstruction of the cascade position and energy allows to extend the search to the full sky ( not only the northern hemisphere ) , since shower events could be discriminated from tracks .",
    "even so , the major background consists of bremsstrahlung showers produced by cosmic muons @xcite . at ultra high energy ranges ( i.e. above 10@xmath0 tev ) the events are very extensive and full",
    "reconstruction is not necessary . at these energies",
    "the background of atmospheric events starts to become negligible and the search can be done by counting the fraction of optical sensors with more than one detected photon , which increases with energy @xcite .    the absence of signal detection in amanda - ii is an indication that the flux of extra - terrestrial neutrinos , if any , is very small . a @xmath1 km@xmath0-scale experiment may open this new observation window by profiting not only of its larger size and more powerful analysis techniques being developed in amanda - ii , but also of the full digitized response of icecube array sensors @xcite ."
