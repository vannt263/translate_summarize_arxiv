    "accurate and precise measurements of the masses of brown dwarfs are necessary to validate the theoretical calculations of their evolution and to determine their location in the hr diagram @xcite .",
    "astrometric and spectroscopic observations of binaries provide the means to accomplish this dynamically .",
    "when the distance to the binary is known , the astrometric orbit of an angularly resolved binary ( hence a `` visual binary '' , vb ) determines the total mass , @xmath3 .",
    "a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) provides the mass ratio .",
    "when a binary can be observed as both a vb and sb2 , the component masses can be determined . since the vb also yields the orbital inclination , the vb and sb2 measurements together provide an independent determination of the binary s distance . in the special case of an eclipsing binary ,",
    "the orbital inclination is @xmath4 and the sb2 observations alone suffice to determine the component masses .    although brown dwarf binaries are not rare @xcite , precise dynamical masses are known only for the brown dwarf components of the eclipsing binary in orion discovered by @xcite .",
    "their masses , radii , and effective temperatures agree reasonably well with the models , but surprisingly , the effective temperature of the primary is found to be cooler than that of the secondary . @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have reported brown dwarf masses based on an astrometrically determined @xmath3 and photometry , but reliable masses determined dynamically are not yet available . @xcite",
    "obtained angularly resolved spectra of gl  569  ba and bb but their measurements were insufficient to yield dynamical masses . because only two brown dwarf masses are known , and they raise a puzzle that requires confirmation , it is desirable to enlarge the sample of dynamically determined masses and to cover as large a range of mass and age as possible .",
    "gl 569 is a multiple system comprised of gl  569  a , a m2.5v star @xcite of mass @xmath5 @xcite at the @xmath6 distance @xmath7  pc , and gl  569  b , thought to be a binary brown dwarf with period @xmath8  days @xcite .",
    "we began a study of gl  569  b in 2002 because the astrometric orbit is well determined and the components , ba and bb , are bright enough to be observed at high spectral resolution in the near - ir .",
    "thus , gl  569  b is well suited for the fusion of vb and sb2 techniques to measure the mass of its components .",
    "this paper presents our results .",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction in  2 , the results for gl 569 a and b in  3 and  4 , respectively , and discuss our results in  5 .",
    "we present a summary and suggestions for future work in  6 .",
    "all observations were obtained at the w. m. keck observatory using the facility near - infrared spectrometer nirspec @xcite and near - ir camera , nirc-2 .",
    "we used nirspec in its high spectral resolution mode centered at 1.55 @xmath9 m , with and without the adaptive optics ( ao ) system @xcite .",
    "the nirc-2 observations in the @xmath10- and @xmath11-bands were made using ao .",
    "table  1 provides a log of the observations .",
    "we used a 2-pixel wide slit for all nirspec observations which provided spectral resolution @xmath1234,000 with ao and @xmath1231,000 without it .",
    "with ao , the diffraction resolution was @xmath13  mas .",
    "this enabled us to measure the angularly resolved spectra of gl  569  ba and bb simultaneously with both objects on the appropriately rotated spectrometer slit .",
    "all observations were taken as a series of @xmath14  s integrations with the targets shifted in an abba pattern between two positions separated by @xmath1210@xmath15 on the slit without ao , and @xmath121@xmath15 with ao .",
    "sets of 10 flats and 10 darks were median filtered and the results , along with individual ab pairs of target data , were input into the redspec code for rectification , flat - fielding , and spectral extraction .",
    "the resultant spectra for a single object were then averaged .",
    "we worked with nirspec orders 48 and 49 , centered at @xmath121.59 and @xmath121.56@xmath9 m , respectively , because these are the most free of telluric absorption of the 9 orders available at the grating setting we used ( see * ? ? ? * figure  1 ) .",
    "spectral lamp line integrations were taken to obtain the dispersion solution for the ao spectra .",
    "for the non - ao observations , the night sky oh lines were used for this purpose .",
    "we measured radial velocities of the targets with the two - dimensional correlation algorithm todcor @xcite , following procedures we have described previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "todcor requires template spectra for the primary and secondary components .",
    "when we observed and reduced nirspec template spectra for the first time @xcite , we compared their radial velocities to similar measurements of the same stars by @xcite and @xcite in order to determine the uncertainty , @xmath161.0  km  s@xmath17 , in our velocities .",
    "more recently , @xcite have published very precise radial velocities of 844 fgkm stars , including several whose ir spectra we use as templates .",
    "we used the @xcite measurements to correct the velocities of stars earlier than m4 in our suite of templates and used the corrected values to bootstrap improvements to templates of later spectral type .",
    "we list the revised values in table  2 ; for the stars in common with @xcite all the revised velocities are within 2.2  km  s@xmath17 of the values given there , and most agree to a few tenths of a km  s@xmath17 .",
    "the nirc-2 images have a scale of @xmath18 per pixel and a field of view of @xmath12@xmath19 , sufficient to include both gl  569  a and b simultaneously .",
    "we took data in the @xmath10- and @xmath11-bands in a five - point dither pattern .",
    "integration times for each frame varied from @xmath20  s. after flat - fielding the individual images with the dark - subtracted flat , we expanded the the pixel scale by a factor of 10 to improve the measurement precision of the relative positions and photometry for gl  569  a , ba , and bb . for the february , 2005 data , we used gl  569  a to centroid the images for shifting and adding multiple exposures and to create an instrumental point - spread function ( psf ) in the @xmath10- and @xmath11-bands .",
    "gl  569  a was saturated in the images obtained on december 2004 so we could use these data only for astrometry and relative photometry of gl  569  ba and bb .",
    "the proper motion of gl  569  a is @xmath21 and @xmath22  mas  yr@xmath17 ( _ hipparcos _ ) .",
    "thus , in the @xmath1220  years since the discovery by @xcite of gl  569  b , the a component has moved @xmath12@xmath23 on the sky . our february , 2005",
    "nirc-2 @xmath10- and @xmath11-band images showed the photocenter of gl  569  b @xmath24 north , and @xmath25 east with respect to gl  569  a. this offset of b with respect to a lies @xmath12@xmath26 from that measured by @xcite ( table 3 , figure 1 ) and confirms their finding that a and b form a common proper motion system .",
    "our measurement , taken together with the positions measured by @xcite and @xcite , clearly indicates the orbital motion of gl  569  b with respect to a ( figure 1 ) .    using spectroscopy in visible light",
    ", @xcite showed that gl  569  a s spectral type is m2.5  v. to measure the radial velocity of gl  569  a and , in the process , to estimate its spectral type , we analyzed the order 49 spectra obtained on ut 20 april 2003 , ut 14 june , 2003 , and ut 25 may 2004 .",
    "the spectrum of the template star gl  436 , spectral type m2.5  v @xcite , produced the highest correlation with gl  569  a s spectrum , in agreement with henry & kirkpatrick s result .",
    "the difference between the average of our radial velocity measurements , @xmath27  km  s@xmath17 ( table  4 ) , and the center - of - mass velocity of the ba@xmath28bb pair (  4.3 ) is @xmath29  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "the velocity difference arising in the orbital motion of b with respect to a is expected to be small (  5 ) and to lie below the significance limit of our measurements .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of gl  569  a at @xmath30 and @xmath10 are @xmath31  mag and @xmath32  mag , respectively ( _ hipparcos , 2mass _ ) , corresponding to absolute magnitudes @xmath33  mag and @xmath34  mag at distance 9.81  pc . using near - ir surface gravity indicators and model stellar spectra , @xcite estimated that gl  569  a s mass is @xmath35  m@xmath2 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath36 and @xmath37 vs mass diagrams using these values .",
    "surprisingly , these mass - luminosity diagrams indicate an age of 20@xmath2840 myr for gl  569  a , much younger than the several hundred myr estimates of the ages of the brown dwarfs ba and bb @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , that the theoretical isochrones underestimate the age of a star in this range of mass and age ( i. baraffe , priv .",
    "comm . ) . to obtain an independent estimate of the age",
    ", we followed k.  luhman s suggestion ( priv .",
    "2005 ) and placed gl  569  a on a ( v@xmath28k ) color vs. absolute @xmath11 magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for the pleiades cluster , thought to be 100@xmath28125 myr old @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows that gl  569  a lies on the pleiades main - sequence , indicating that it is about the same age",
    ". gl  569  a could be older than it appears in figures  2 or 3 if it were fainter and its apparent magnitude represented that of two stars in a binary . however , its spectrum in both the visible and ir is that of an m 2.5 with no evidence of either a companion , or variability of its velocity on the three occasions that we measured it in the ir .",
    "its h and k - band images also show no evidence of a companion . we conclude that 1 ) gl 569 a is a single star , 2 ) its age is 100 - 125 myr , and 3 ) gl 569 a seems to be younger than the age previously estimated for its brown dwarf companions .",
    "figure 4 shows the @xmath10- and @xmath11-band composite images of gl  569  ba - bb from the ut 25 february 2005 nirc-2 observations .",
    "we modeled the brown dwarf binary as the sum of two scaled psfs ; the single star psf was provided by the simultaneously obtained image of gl  569  a , which had fwhm = 41  mas at @xmath10 and 53  mas at @xmath11 .",
    "the ao correction achieved a strehl ratio of @xmath120.3 at @xmath10 and @xmath120.4 at @xmath11 .",
    "we determined the positions and amplitudes of ba - bb relative to each other , and to gl  569  a , by least squares fitting .",
    "we used the 2mass magnitudes of gl  569  a at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath32  mag and @xmath38  mag , respectively , to determine the magnitudes of ba and bb .",
    "the astrometric and photometric results are given in table 5 . because we could not use gl  569  a as a psf (  3 ) in the december , 2004 data , we formed a composite ba - bb psf by cross - correlating the images and shifting them for greatest correlation .",
    "we measured the position of bb relative to ba by modeling the psf as an elliptical gaussian and fitting to the composite image .",
    "the astrometric results and bb / ba flux ratios from the december , 2004 observations are included in table 5 .",

    "figure 5 shows the apparent orbit derived from the astrometry reported by @xcite , @xcite , and table 5 .",
    "we calculated the orbital parameters using procedures written by @xcite and described in @xcite .",
    "the new values ( table 6 ) are in excellent agreement with those published by @xcite .",
    "our observations extend the time over which the orbital motion of the gl  569  b binary has been monitored from 0.85 to 2.3 orbital periods ; as expected , their main effect is to improve the precision of @xmath47 and @xmath43 .",
    "the total mass of ba@xmath28bb that follows from these values is @xmath48  m@xmath2 .",
    "this value is consistent with that determined by @xcite but the uncertainty is larger because our value includes the uncertainty of the _ hipparcos _ distance measurement and theirs does not .",
    "non - ao nirspec spectra of gl  569  b do not angularly resolve ba and bb .",
    "a todcor analysis of blended spectra of gl  569  b using our suite of templates ( table  2 ) showed that the template spectrum of gl  644  c ( m7 ) provided high correlation .",
    "the analysis also showed that precise measurement of the component velocities would be difficult because the radial velocity difference between ba and bb is only a few km  s@xmath17 , the spectra of the components were similar and complex , and the spectral lines of ba appeared to be significantly broadened .",
    "we expected that we would obtain the highest velocity precision by using angularly resolved spectra of ba and bb themselves as templates . to this end , we used nirspec with ao to measure their angularly resolved spectra on ut 20 april 2003 and ut 24 may 2004 .",
    "the small angular separation of ba and bb required care in the extraction of their spectra to minimize contamination .",
    "figure  6 illustrates our procedure .",
    "the lower panel shows a sample profile of the two - dimensional spectrum in the cross - dispersion direction from ut 24 may 2004 , obtained by median filtering a redspec rectified image along the dispersion direction ; the ao plate scale is @xmath49 pixel@xmath17 .",
    "there is significant blending in the region between ba and bb .",
    "we modelled the profile as the sum of two gaussians of equal width with separation equal to that of ba and bb .",
    "the upper panel of figure  6 shows the extraction widths , denoted by the vertical lines and hashed regions , chosen to avoid the central region where the profiles are blended .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussians in figure  6 is about twice the diffraction limit at @xmath50 m .",
    "the quality of the seeing and the ao correction varied during the may 2004 observations ; the psf in the profile shown was especially broad .",
    "we varied the extraction widths to suit each observation .",
    "figure  6 shows that even in this case the selected regions suffer little contamination .",
    "we believe therefore that our procedure produced individual target spectra and hence templates useful for analysis of the blended spectra .    to determine the radial velocity of ba in orders 48 and 49 on ut 20 april 2003 and ut 24 may 2004 , we cross - correlated spectra of ba with our gl  644  c template , and found the highest correlation for @xmath51  km  s@xmath17 , if we interpret the line broadening as attributable to rotation .",
    "similarly , for bb , using the gl  644  c template , the highest correlation was obtained with @xmath52  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "the measured radial velocities of ba and bb in the two orders on the two dates differed by the measurement error . to use the individual ba and bb spectra as templates to analyze the blended , non - ao b component spectra ,",
    "we averaged the measured velocities in orders 48 and 49 ; these values appear in table  7 .",
    "figure  7 shows , in the heliocentric reference frame , the april , 2003 and may , 2004 ao resolved spectra of gl  569  ba and bb in orders 48 and 49 and , for comparison , a non - ao spectrum of gl  569  b measured on ut 22 february 2005 .",
    "the spectral range displayed for order 48 is less than that for order 49 because we did not analyze the @xmath12@xmath53 wide section shortward of @xmath54 that suffers from terrestrial @xmath55 absorption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  1 ) .",
    "it is evident that the lines in the spectrum of ba are more broadened than those of bb .",
    "except for the effects of broadening , the spectral features in ba and bb appear identical suggesting that the spectral types must be very similar .",
    "these results are consistent with the finding of @xcite that , in their high - resolution , angularly resolved @xmath56band spectra , also obtained using nirspec , ba and bb appeared as spectral type m8.5 and m9 , with significant broadening characterized by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "we analyzed the non - ao spectra with todcor twice using the two different ao - resolved templates for ba and bb from the two different nirspec with ao runs .",
    "we list the radial velocities in table  7 .",
    "the oh emission lines in order 48 are weaker than those in order 49 ; on ut 22 december 2002 and ut 14 june 2003 , the integration times were not long enough to expose the oh lines for a reliable dispersion solution and we do not list order 48 velocities for those dates .",
    "we considered the difference in velocities derived on a given date using the two sets of ao - resolved templates as an empirical measure of the error .",
    "thus , for each order , we considered the differences    @xmath59    in which the @xmath60 s are the radial velocities of ba measured on the @xmath42th occasion using the ao templates obtained in april , 2003 and may , 2004 ( table  7 ) .",
    "the same procedure was applied to the velocities of bb .",
    "the distribution of the 28 differences is centered at @xmath61  km  s@xmath17 , indicating that there is no systematic velocity offset in either set of templates .",
    "the standard deviations for the @xmath62 and @xmath63 are 1.8 and 1.4  km  s@xmath17 , respectively ; these values are listed in table  7 as the velocity uncertainties of the ba and bb components .",
    "we attribute the larger uncertainty associated with the measurements for ba to the greater velocity width of its spectral lines .",
    "velocity measurements of a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) yield @xmath64 , @xmath65 , in physical units , and the velocity semi - amplitudes of the primary and secondary , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "these are related to the mass ratio , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the semi - major axes of the primary and secondary by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "our analysis of gl  569  b as an sb2 began by calculating the difference , in the @xmath77 sense , of possible velocity solutions to the data , deriving @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath78 , the center - of - mass velocity , for the minimum value of @xmath77 .",
    "we did this twice , the first time applying the templates for ba and bb measured in april , 2003 , and the second using the may , 2004 templates .",
    "the minimum reduced @xmath77 is @xmath121.1 for both solutions .",
    "the results for the velocity semi - amplitude of bb and the center - of - mass velocity are in excellent agreement with each other , but the results for the velocity semi - amplitude of ba are not . using the april , 2003 templates ,    @xmath79    and using the may , 2004 templates ,    @xmath80    we attribute the large difference of the two @xmath66 values to the large velocity width of ba s spectrum , as also manifested (  4.2 ) in the scatter of the @xmath62 , larger than that of the @xmath63 . because @xmath81 is well - determined , we analyzed gl  569  b as single - lined system on the basis of the bb data",

    "the value of @xmath91 can not be taken at face value given the similarity of the ba and bb spectra ( figure  7 ) and their flux ratio @xmath92 ( table  5 ) .",
    "a promising explanation is that ba itself is a close , angularly unresolved binary , and that gl  569  b consists of three brown dwarfs , two at ba , one at bb as previously suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the masses of the ba brown dwarfs are probably @xmath12@xmath93  m@xmath2 each , and that of bb , @xmath12@xmath94  m@xmath2 .",
    "this explanation would account for the observed facts : that ba is about twice as bright as bb at h , that the total mass is @xmath120.12  m@xmath2 , and that the spectra of ba and bb appear identical except for the greater line width of ba .",
    "the greater line width of ba could be attributable either to rotational broadening , which could disguise the presence of an additional component , or some combination of line broadening and ba orbital motion .",
    "if the candidate binary possesses an orbital inclination distinct from and larger than that of the ba@xmath28bb system , the confusion between broadened lines and velocity shifts would be accentuated , particularly for objects of the similar spectral type .",

    "it differs , however , by 3  km s@xmath17 from the value reported by @xcite , @xmath100  km  s@xmath17 . unlike our measurement , which is referenced to the stellar radial velocities of the spectral type templates , @xcite measured the doppler shift of the k  i doublet in their @xmath101-band spectra using the observed and laboratory wavelengths .",
    "we believe that our value is representative of the actual value because it is based on all the lines in the spectra .",
    "our measurement thus avoids the complications of measuring a doppler shift of the pressure broadened and nearly saturated lines of the k  i doublet .",
