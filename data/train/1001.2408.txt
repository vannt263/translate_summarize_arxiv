    "representations of fundamental groups of manifolds of dimension 2 and 3 in a compact lie group have a long history . in the case of surfaces",
    ", they appeared after the development of teichmuller theory , for instance to classify holomorphic vector bundles . in the case of 3-manifolds , they were used to help distinguishing 3-manifolds , as knot complements or for geometrization purposes . then",
    ", in the eighties , representations of surfaces were much studied for their symplectic properties until witten discovered a deep relationship between these representation spaces and the jones polynomial of knots , via chern - simons quantum field theory .",
    "this field is still very lively and these notes were written as a preparation for understanding this relationship .",
    "we planned to give a quick review of the geometric aspects of the representation spaces .    in a first part , we give some examples of representation spaces for surfaces and knots .",
    "they will help the reader to understand the second part where we introduce the basic tool in order to understand the differential geometry of representation spaces : twisted ( co)homology .",
    "we give a brief account on the symplectic structure on surfaces and on reidemeister torsion .",
    "we introduce gauge theory in the third part and review the symplectic structure of surface representations in this context .",
    "this third part is mostly an introduction to the fourth where we explain the basic constructions of chern - simons theory and its applications to the geometry of representation spaces .",
    "the fifth part studies in more details the representation space of a closed surface of genus at least 2 by introducing trace functions and a related integrable system . in the last part",
    ", we give an introduction to geometric quantization , insisting on lagrangian fibrations and spin structures . with the help of some examples , we treat the case of representation space of surfaces .",

    "denote by @xmath841 the bundle @xmath831 as before .",
    "then the holonomy of @xmath841 is 1 along @xmath713 and @xmath875 along @xmath899 .",
    "we prove this proposition by considering half - periods : suppose that two representations @xmath923 are the same when composed with the projection @xmath924so@xmath925 . then , because @xmath926 , we have @xmath927}{\\mathcal{m}}(\\sigma)=t_{[\\rho_2]}{\\mathcal{m}}(\\sigma)$ ] . moreover ,",
    "if we start the flow @xmath716 from a representation @xmath21 during a time @xmath668 , we reach the representation @xmath928 where @xmath929 is the poincar dual of @xmath409 in @xmath930 .",

    "finally , the map @xmath428 satisfies @xmath931 .",
    "this shows that the lagrangian subbundles at @xmath21 and @xmath928 correspond so that we are allowed to compute the holonomy of @xmath841 along that path . if we show that this holonomy is @xmath875 we prove the proposition as @xmath713 is a composition of 2 such paths and @xmath899 is a composition of 3 of them .",
    "as @xmath896 is convex , all fibers of @xmath428 are isotopic and the holonomy of @xmath841 do not depend on which fiber we consider .",
    "let us do the computation in the following case : let @xmath932 be the standard generators of @xmath933 satisfying the following relation with @xmath178 even : @xmath934    then we define an element @xmath21 of @xmath702 by setting @xmath935 , @xmath936 .",

    ", we can suppose that only the first two projections of the vectors @xmath953 depend on @xmath133 .",
    "considering a fixed basis of @xmath956 , we push it to @xmath950 with the injective map @xmath957 and get 3 vectors @xmath958 . at the same time , we consider three vectors @xmath959 in @xmath950 whose image by @xmath960 is a fixed basis of @xmath961 . by construction",

    "first , we have @xmath966 . in particular , @xmath967 so that @xmath968 for @xmath969 and @xmath970 so that we can set @xmath971 .      writing the matrix of this basis we find a matrix @xmath974 with the property that its derivative is block triangular with on the diagonal zeros and one 2 * 2 rotation matrix @xmath975 of angle @xmath133 .",
    "this proves that in gl@xmath964 , this path is not topologically trivial as the inclusion of @xmath976 at the level of fondamental groups sends @xmath975 to the generator .",
    "this ends the proof in our case .",

    "some easy developments : count the number of bohr - sommerfeld fibers and compare to the verlinde formula ( the dimension of conformal blocks , see @xcite or @xcite ) . explain how the functions @xmath906 are quantized and act naturally on the quantization .",

    "it is not clear wether this pairing gives a unitary isomorphism between the two quantizations .",
    "if so , it would give a satisfactory description of the quantization of @xmath289 where all trace functions would be quantizable , and the action of the mapping class group of @xmath75 would extend to the quantization .",
