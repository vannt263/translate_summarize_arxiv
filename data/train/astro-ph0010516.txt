    "optically selected quasar samples are the most complete ones",
    ". however , every survey technique has a redshift and a luminosity - dependent selection biases ( wampler and ponz 1985 ) .",
    "only the combination of the different search techniques in different spectral ranges , will yield a complete sample of quasars , with an adequate representation of the properties inherent to them ( hartwick & shade 1990 ; chavushyan 1995 ) .",
    "we have started a multiwavelength search for qsos in the well optically investigated sbs sky area .",

    "the first radio survey ( becker et al . 1995 ) provides a new resource for constructing a large quasar sample . with positions accurate to 1  and a point source sensitivity limit of 1 mjy",
    ", it goes 50 times fainter in flux than any previous radio survey .",
    "the fbqs ( gregg et al . 1996 ; white et al . 2000 ) is a qso survey based on first .",
    "unfortunately , for the fbqs area there is a lack of complete optically selected samples of qsos .",
    "hence , it is very difficult to estimate the completeness of this latter survey , as well as , the number of missed quasars in the optical fbqs sample .",
    "in order to detect the missing qsos in the sbs , and to create a more complete qso sample , we have cross - identified the deep radio ( first ) and optical ( apm ) databases .",
    "the overlap of the surveys is about 700 sq .",

    "we have selected objects classified as stellar - like on apm with b - magnitudes between 145 and 185 coincident with the positions of the first sources within 3  radius .",
    "the sources , in this region , are @xmath1 objects , of which 90 were previously known agns ( discovered mainly by the sbs ) ( fig .",

    "we have carried out spectroscopic observations for  150 faqs objects ( see examples in fig.2 ) .",
    "so far , in this studied subsample , we have found 51 new qsos ( 4 bal ) , 13 seyfert galaxies ( 5 nlsy1 s ) , 23 emission line galaxies , 3 bl lac objects and 57 high galactic latitude stars ."
