    "the abjm theory is the @xmath9 @xmath10 quiver superconformal chern - simons theory . in the @xmath11 notation ,",
    "each vertex of the quiver is assigned with @xmath5 chern - simons vector multiplet @xmath12 with chern - simons levels @xmath13 while each edge is assigned with a pair of bifundamental hypermultiplets @xmath14 and @xmath15 which are charged under @xmath16 as @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "later a new expression of the abjm matrix model was discovered as the canonical partition function of a quantum statistical system of @xmath0 particle ideal fermi gas , where the level @xmath4 is converted into the planck constant @xmath23 in the statistical system @xcite .",
    "this relation enables us a systematic analysis of the large @xmath0 expansion of the partition function in the m - theoretical regime @xmath24 , in terms of the grand potential @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 here @xmath27 is an auxiliary parameter called the chemical potential dual to @xmath0 . the original partition function can be recovered by the following inverse transformation @xmath28 for finite value of @xmath4 , the large @xmath0 expansion of the partition function corresponds to the large @xmath27 expansion of the grand potential .",
