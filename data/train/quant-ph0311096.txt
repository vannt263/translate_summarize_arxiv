    "quantum information science is based on the discovery that there are physical states of a quantum system which enable tasks that can not be accomplished in a classical world .",
    "an important example of such a task is quantum teleportation@xcite .",
    "teleportation , like most recent ideas in quantum information science , is based squarely on the physical properties of non - relativistic quantum systems .    recognizing that information science must be grounded in our understanding of the physical world , one is prompted to ask how relativistic considerations might impact tasks that rely on quantum entangled states .",
    "there has recently been some interest in this question for inertial frames .",
    "while lorentz transformations can not change the overall quantum entanglement of a bipartite state@xcite , they can change which properties of the local systems are entangled . in particular , gingrich and",
    "adami@xcite showed that under a lorentz transformation the initial entanglement of just the spin degrees of freedom of two spin half particles can be transferred into an entanglement between both the spin and momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "physically this means that detectors , which respond only to spin degrees of freedom , will see a reduction of entanglement when they are moving at large uniform velocity .",
    "put simply , the nature of the entanglement resource depends on the inertial reference frame of the detectors .",
    "a similar result holds for photons@xcite .    in this paper",
    "however , we wish to consider quantum entanglement in non - inertial frames . in order to make the discussion physically relevant ,",
    "we concentrate on a particular quantum information task ; quantum teleportation .",
    "we will show that the fidelity of teleportation is compromised when the receiver is making observations in a uniformly accelerated frame .",
    "this is quite distinct from any reduction in fidelity through the lorentz mixing of degrees of freedom noted by gingrich and adami@xcite .",
    "rather it is direct consequence of the existence of davies - unruh radiation for accelerated observers . in",
    "so far as teleportation fidelity is an operational measure of quantum entanglement , our results suggest that quantum entanglement may not be preserved in non - inertial frames .",
    "while the degree of decoherence is exceedingly small for practical accelerations , the apparent connection between space time geometry and quantum entanglement is intriguing .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section ii",
    "we discuss the essential features of quantum field theory for an accelerated observer in flat spacetime .",
    "we concentrate our discussion on a massless scalar field , which will be used to model photons , ignoring polarization . in section iii",
    ", we recall the usual flat space teleportation protocol , and explore the degradation of the fidelity of the teleported state when one of the participants undergoes uniform acceleration @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the reduction of fidelity in terms of entropy , and the lack of information gain experienced by the accelerated observer . in section iv , we extend the previous bosonic results to the case of dirac particles , and discuss the similarities and specific differences .",
    "we summarize and conclude our results in section v. in an appendix , we discuss a somewhat analogous effect for the case of bosons in terms of the familiar process of optical parametric down conversion .",

    "( 01| + 10| ) + ^2 r 11| , and the post measurement state , again for the choice of @xmath131 , is given by _",
    "post^(i ) = ^2 r    that the von neumann entropies ( in bits ) satisfy the relation @xmath195 and hence rob s information gain is given by s_gain = s_pre - s_post = ^2 r . at zero acceleration , @xmath120 , with alice and rob both minkowski , @xmath196 states that rob can completely restore the properties of the state that alice teleports to him . at infinite acceleration ,",
    "@xmath197 , rob s information gain saturates at a value @xmath198 again due to the finite number of excitations allowed by the fermionic system .",
    "the main issues of teleportation between an inertial minkowksi observer alice and a non - inertial , uniformly accelerated rindler observer rob are two fold .",
    "first , as a result of the acceleration , the minkowski vacuum that rob moves through ( for a single rindler mode @xmath32 ) can be written as a two - mode squeezed state with the component fock states existing in causally disconnected regions @xmath15 and @xmath26 .",
    "second , as a result of this fact , rob perceives the minkowski vacuum as a pure thermal state of temperature @xmath48 as the inevitable result of his complete ignorance of region @xmath26 . in an attempt to teleport a state @xmath199 to rob ,",
    "the best we can expect this uniformly accelerated observer to recover at the end of the protocol is @xmath200 .",
    "we have shown that the fidelity of rob s post - measurement state with this best possible result @xmath119 is @xmath201 .",
    "in addition , we have demonstrated that the information gain obtained by rob ( defined as the difference in the von neumann entropies of his pre- and post - measurement states ) , decreases with increasing acceleration through the minkowski vacuum , which rob perceives as a rindler thermal state . at high acceleration ( high davies - unruh temperatures )",
    "all information is lost and rob perceives only the thermalized vacuum state .",
    "recently , anderson _",
    "et al _ @xcite have also discussed teleportation and the unruh vacuum . however , that work considers a situation that is physically quite different than the one presented here .",
    "the authors use the _ mirror modes _ of audretsch and mller @xcite and consequently have the accelerated observers travelling on oppositely directed hyperbolas , with alice in region @xmath15 and bob in the causally disconnected region @xmath26 .",
    "the teleportation protocol is then interpreted from the point of view of a minkowski observer mork . in this work ,",
    "we consider a setup between observers , one stationary , the other accelerated , who remain causally connected to each other during the teleportation protocol .",
    "kok and yurtsever @xcite have recently considered the interaction of a uniformly accelerated qubit with a massless scalar field ( in a similar fashion to the classic `` particle detector '' calculation of unruh and wald @xcite ) and show that the qubit decoheres . for long interaction times and slow enough accelerations the decoherence can be made arbitrarily small . in general , a more realistic , though much more difficult analysis would take into account any decoherence effects arising from rob s motion from zero to some finite constant acceleration .",
    "hu _ et al _",
    "@xcite have also considered the motion of an arbitrary number of detectors modelled as oscillators and minimally coupled to a massless scalar field in @xmath202 dimensions . in this approach ,",
    "the scalar field is integrated out , leaving a reduced set of effective semiclassical equations which nonetheless contain the full quantum dynamics of the field . for an accelerated detector and probe",
    "the main contributions arise from field correlations across the horizon .",
    "the model investigated here is analogous to teleportation through two channels , one of which is free space for alice and the second which involves parametric down conversion with the following caveat described below . in the second channel , a signal mode @xmath15 and an idler mode @xmath26 experience a squeezing bogoliubov transformation analogous to @xcite ( see appendix [ appendix_vacuum_state ] ) . here",
    "@xmath68 is proportional to the coupling strength between the signal and idler mode times the length of the crystal through which the parametric down conversion takes place ; higher interaction strengths and/or longer interaction lengths corresponds to a higher davies - unruh temperature .",
    "the caveat is that rob , acting as say the signal mode , has no access to information about the idler and therefore must trace out this information . performing the teleportation protocol in such",
    "a system is analogous to teleportation between a minkowski and rindler observer as considered in this work . in the parametric down conversion model , rob can choose to ignore the idler information thus mimicking a rindler observer .",
    "however , for an accelerated observer , the existence of the horizons @xmath203 is of fundamental importance .",
    "since region @xmath15 and @xmath26 are causally disconnected , there is no way , even in principle , for rob to have any information about region @xmath26 , and thus his state is always a reduced density matrix appropriate for region @xmath15 .",
    "the work presented here also has implications for teleportation in curved spacetimes .",
    "recently , the equivalence of hawking and davies - unruh temperatures has been established by embedding curved spacetimes in flat spaces of sufficiently high dimension , and then computing the davies - unruh temperatures of uniformly accelerated observers in the latter @xcite . for a scalar field near a horizon , the wave equation takes a universal free field form , and the mode decomposition is essentially the same as in the rindler case . the analysis for curved spacetimes would proceed in an analogous fashion as the one presented here , but in the higher dimensional flat space , and teleportation would again be degraded by the observer s acceleration .",
    "details will be expanded upon in future work .",
    "we have given an explanation of the reduction of teleportation fidelity in terms of the davies - unruh radiation seen by rob in his frame .",
    "note that this is an operationally meaningful statement as rob can attempt to verify that he has received the desired state @xmath204 by local verification measurements ( e.g. a single photon interference experiment in the bosonic case ) , and then send the results to alice . from an operational point of view alice would conclude that the shared entangled resource has become decohered .",
    "it is well know that entanglement is a fragile resource in the presence of environmental decoherence .",
    "it appears also to be a fragile resource when one of the entangled parties undergoes acceleration .",
    "while the degree of decoherence is exceedingly small for practical accelerations , the apparent connection between space time geometry and quantum entanglement is intriguing .",
    "the origin of the bosonic two - mode squeezed state vacuum given in and and the subsequent thermal rindler vacuum given by is a simple consequence of the commutation relations of the minkowski and rindler creation and annihilation operators .",
    "following yurke @xcite let us consider the analogous process of parametric down conversion between a signal and idler mode with annihilation operators @xmath205 and @xmath206 respectively .",
    "here we treat the pump as non - depleted . for a vacuum state input ( analogous to the minkowski vacuum @xmath207 ) , the operators @xmath208 given at the output of the squeezing crystal have the general form b_s & = & s_11 a_s + s_12 a^_i b^_i & = & s_21 a_s + s_22 a^_i .",
    "the commutation relations @xmath209=1 $ ] , @xmath210=1 $ ] and @xmath211=0 $ ] result in the constraints |s_11|^2 - |s_12|^2 & = & 1 |s_22|^2 - |s_21|^2 & = & 1 s_11 s^*_21 & = & s_12 s^*_22 .",
    "these relationships can be inverted to write the input operators @xmath12 in terms of the output operators @xmath212 as a_s & = & s^*_11 b_s - s^*_21 b^_i a^_i & = & -s^*_12 b_s + s^*_22 b^_i .",
    "the hyperbolic relations in allow us to write s_11 = r , & & s_12 = e^i r s_21 = e^i r , & & s_22 = r , as used in ( with the unimportant phase @xmath213 absorbed into the definition of the operators ) .",
    "for the case of parametric down conversion , @xmath68 is proportional to the interaction strength times the length of the crystal",
    ". the above relationships also imply b^_s b_s - b^_i b_i = a^_s a_s - a^_i a_i .",
    "thus , the difference in the number of signal and idler photons leaving the squeezing crystal is the same as the initial signal and idler difference at input . in particular",
    ", if the input is the vacuum , requires that the photons must exit the crystal in pairs , each signal photon matched with a corresponding idler photon .",
    "the signal and idler output vacuum states @xmath214 and @xmath215 defined such that @xmath216 and @xmath217 ( analogous to the rinder vacuums in region @xmath15 and @xmath26 ) are different than the vacuum @xmath218 ( analogous to the minkowski vacuum @xmath207 ) annihilated by the input operators @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "since the signal and idler photons are created in pairs the form of the two - mode squeezed vacuum @xmath218 can be taken to be |0_a = _",
    "n=0^ a_n | n _ s | n _ i. from the requirement that @xmath219 , and using we have the equation @xmath220 with solution @xmath221 or @xmath222 .",
    "normalization of the vacuum state @xmath223 produces @xmath224 and yields the state | 0 _ a & = & _ n=0^ ( ) ^n | n _ s | n _ i & = & _ n=0^ ^n r | n _ s | n _ i , where in the last step , was used .",
    "equation([32 ] ) is just .",
    "if one of the output modes is unobserved , the state describing the observed mode is a thermal vacuum state .",
    "this follows from the arguments in section ii where for , say , an un - observed signal mode , we take the observed idler state as ^(i)_|0_a tr_s(|0_a0| ) = ( 1 - 2piomega ) |n_i n      the authors wish to thank jonathan p. dowling , ulvi yurtsever and the members of the jpl quantum computing technologies group for stimulating discussions on this and other topics in relativistic quantum information theory .",
