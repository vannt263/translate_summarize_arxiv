    "the interest to the systems is stipulated by several new phenomena such as aharonov - bohm oscillations @xcite , persistent current @xcite , electron trapping effect in magnetic field @xcite and so forth .",
    "recently , the interest to the system has been enhanced due to the experimental detection @xcite of the fano resonances @xcite in the electron transport .",
    "these resonances consist of asymmetric peak and dip on the energy dependence of transmission coefficient .",
    "they are caused by interference of bound states and continuum of propagating electron waves .",
    "fano resonances in electron transport through various systems are widely studied in literature @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most popular model of quantum interferometer is the one - dimensional ring with two wires attached to it .",
    "this model has been studied in a lot of papers @xcite . in particular , the periodic dependence of conductance on the magnetic field was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using the scattering matrix approach .",
    "the dependence of the transmission probability on the phase shift of the transmitted wave for different degrees of coupling between the current leads and the ring in the presence of a flux was investigated in ref .",
    "it was found that sharp resonances of the breit  wigner type exist in the transmission probability .",
    "two mechanisms giving rise to sharp resonances were considered .",
    "a one - dimensional quantum waveguide theory for mesoscopic structures was proposed in ref .",
    "in particular , the conductance of two - terminal aharonov - bohm ring as a function of the magnetic flux , the arm lengths , and the electron wave vector was found .",
    "the resonant - transport properties of the two - terminal ring and multiply connected ring systems threaded by the magnetic flux was studied using the tight - binding model @xcite .",
    "an explicit form for the conductance of the one - dimensional two - terminal ring threaded by the magnetic flux was found in ref .",
    "@xcite using the zero - range potential theory .",
    "the charge carrier interference in mesoscopic semiconductor rings formed by two quantum wires in self - organizing silicon quantum wells was investigated in ref .",
    "the periodic dependence of the transmission coefficient and the phase shift on source - drain bias in the presence of several @xmath0-shaped barriers in wires was obtained .",
    "the model of one - dimensional quantum ring was used to explain the results in this work .",
    "the presence of an additional scatterer , for instance a quantum dot or an impurity , in the interferometer provides new possibilities to control the electron transport .",

    "the case of one impurity in the ring and diametrically opposite contacts was considered .",
    "a contact between wires and ring was defined using an a priori given energy - independent scattering matrix .",
    "it was shown that in the presence of an impurity transmission probability of the ring may exhibit resonances of the fano type in addition to symmetric breit - wigner peaks .",
    "it was found that the transition from the weak to the strong coupling regime leads to fano line shapes with gradually smaller asymmetry parameters , but the positions of the transmission zeros and ones remain unaffected .",
    "the breit - wigner like shape is sensitive to the coupling and disappears in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the presence of an aharonov - bohm flux alters the amplitudes of the fano resonances , turning them progressively into broad oscillations .",
    "it was found that placing the impurity in a special positions in the arm and certain values of flux causes systematic collapse of certain fano resonances .",

    ", strong dependence of the conductance on positions of impurities might be expected in the system due to quantum interference phenomena .",

    "the role of scatterers may be played by impurities or small quantum dots .",

    "the advantage of the model is the possibility to obtain an analytical expression for the transmission coefficient of the device . in the case of one - dimensional wires",
    "the one - mode transport regime takes place and the conductance does not exceed a unit of the conductance quantum . in this case the transport properties of the device are determined by the single transmission coefficient . to obtain this coefficient",

    "since the hamiltonian of the device should be the energy - independent operator our method seems to be more accurate then the approach based on a priori defined energy - independent scattering matrix of each contact .",
    "it should be mentioned that non - zero width rings have been studied numerically @xcite .",

    "we note that the function ( [ d_psi2 ] ) has no zeros at irrational values of the magnetic flux @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore the position of zeros depends on the strength of the impurity potential .",
    "therefore the positions of contacts have to be coordinated with the value of impurity potential .",
    "the coordination does not take place for all levels at the same time .",
    "hence only one discrete level can appear in the continuous spectrum at @xmath180 . by virtue of the symmetrical property of the function ( [ d_psi2 ] ) ,",
    "the appearance of this level is more likely if the contacts are situated on equal distance from the impurity .",
    "in the general case of arbitrary location of impurities and contacts , the dependence of transmission coefficient on the electron energy contains different type of overlapping resonances and oscillations .",

    "therefore the presence of the mirror symmetry in the system leads to simultaneous collapse of all fano resonances .",
    "the fano resonances appear again if the symmetry is broken by shift of any impurity or by different values of point potentials ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "collapse of several fano resonances in vicinities of @xmath98 occurs if the positions of the impurities are given by @xmath200 and @xmath201 where @xmath179 , @xmath202 and @xmath26 are integer .",

    "hence the addition of the second impurity at the diametrically opposite point leads to increase of the conductance due do constructive interference .",
    "it should be mentioned that the destructive interference at half - integer values of the magnetic flux leads to the perfect reflection if the system has mirror or inverse symmetry .",
    "therefore the transmission coefficient vanishes at the half - integer magnetic flux if two identical impurities are located at diametrically opposite points ( @xmath203 ) or at the same distance from contacts ( @xmath191 ) .",

    "the presence of impurities can lead either to decrease or to increase in the transmission coefficient .",
    "in particular , the transmission increases in presence of impurities due to breaking of the destructive interference if the value magnetic flux through the ring equals to half - integer number of the magnetic flux quanta .",
    "the ring without impurities may be considered as ideal electron mirror in this case .",
    "our analysis shows that the dependence of the transmission coefficient on the electron energy exhibits fano resonances at certain energies .",
    "these resonances consist of the sharp transmission peak and the nearby transmission zero . in the complex plane of energy , the fano resonance",
    "is represented by pole and nearby zero of the transmission amplitude .",
    "resonances arise as a result of interaction between discrete level and continuous spectrum .",
    "the necessary condition of appearing of the fano resonance in the quantum ring is partial symmetry breaking by the magnetic field or the asymmetrical location of impurities or contacts .",
    "we have found that the collapse of fano resonances occurs at certain parameters of the system . in this case , the pole and the zero of the transmission amplitude coincide and cancel each other .",
    "the discrete level immersed in the continuous spectrum arises in this case .",
    "in particular , collapse of the fano resonance in the vicinity of the discrete level @xmath166 occurs if all perturbations on the ring are situated at zeros of the wave function defined by eq .",

    "another mechanism of disappearing of transmission zeros is possible in the system in addition to the collapse of fano resonances .",
    "the zero may be shifted from the real axis in the complex plane . in this case , the dip of transmission coefficient is conserved but the minimum value does not reach zero .",
    "we mention that the collapse of the fano resonance is accompanied by increase in symmetry of the system while the shift of the zero is accompanied by decrease in symmetry ."
