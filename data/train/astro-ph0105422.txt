    "there are many strongly magnetized stars moving through the ism of our galaxy .",
    "one of the most numerous populations is that of isolated old neutron stars ( ions ) and old magnetars , which are not observed as radio or x - ray pulsars but which may still be strongly magnetized .",
    "there are about @xmath8 isolated radio pulsars observed in the galaxy .",
    "the typical age of a radio pulsar is estimated as @xmath9 yr ( e.g. , manchester & taylor 1977 ) .",
    "subsequent to the pulsar stage , the neutron stars are still strongly magnetized .",
    "pulsar magnetic fields decay on a longer timescale than the lifetime of a radio pulsar .",
    "thus the number of magnetized isolated old neutron stars ( mions ) should be larger than the number of pulsars .",
    "total number of ( magnetized and non - magnetized ) isolated old neutron stars is estimated to be @xmath10 .",
    "the ions could be observed in the solar neighborhood owing to a low - rate accretion to their surface from the ism ( ostriker , rees , & silk 1970 ) ; schvartsman 1971 ; treves & colpi 1991 , blaes & madau 1993 ) .",
    "many of them may have strong magnetic fields , @xmath11 during significant period of their evolution @xmath12 ( e.g. livio _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , treves _",
    "_ 2000 ) .",
    "recently it has been emphasized that some neutron stars , termed magnetars , may have anomalously strong magnetic fields at their origin @xmath13 ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ( hereafter td95 ) ; thompson & duncan 1996 ) .",
    "magnetars pass through their pulsar stage much faster than classical pulsars , in @xmath14 years ( td95 ) .",
    "observations of soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and long - period pulsars in supernova remnants , especially young supernova remnants ( vasisht & gotthelf 1997 ) support the idea that these objects are magnetars ( kulkarni & frail 1993 ; kouveliotou _ et al . _ 1994 ) .",
    "the estimated birthrate of sgrs is @xmath15 of ordinary pulsars ( kulkarni & frail 1993 ; kouveliotou _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , 1999 ) .",
    "thus magnetars may constitute a non - negligible percentage of ions .",
    "mions and magnetars typically move supersonically through the ism and have extended magnetospheres .",
    "two main regimes are possible : in the first , the alfvn radius @xmath1 is much smaller than gravitational accretion radius @xmath0 , so that matter is gravitationally attracted by the star and direct accretion to a star is possible ( e.g. hoyle and lyttleton 1939 ; bondi 1952 ; lamb , pethick , & pines 1973 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & pogorelov 1997 ) . in the second regime ,",
    "the magnetic standoff distance or alfvn radius @xmath1 is larger than accretion radius and the magnetosphere interacts with the ism without gravitational focusing .",
    "this case we term the `` magnetic plow '' regime ( this corresponds to  georotator \" regime in lipunov , 1992 ) .",
    "this is the regime for fast moving mions and magnetars .",
    "neither of these regimes was investigated numerically in application to magnetized star propagation through the ism .",
    "most of simulations of this type were done to model the interaction of the earth s magnetosphere with the solar wind ( e.g. , nishida , baker & cowley 1998 ) , where parameters of the problem were fixed by the solar wind and earth s magnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the supersonic motion of magnetized stars through the ism where a wide range of physical parameters is possible .",
    "we investigate the physical process of interaction of magnetospheres with the ism and estimate the possible observational consequences of such interaction . in ",
    "2 we estimate the important physical parameters , and in  3 we describe the numerical model . in  4 we summarize results of simulations for @xmath16 and for a small mach number , @xmath3 . in  5",
    "we discuss results of simulations in the `` magnetic plow '' regime . in  6 we discuss possible observational consequences of our results . in ",
    "7 we give a brief summary .",
    "after the radio pulsar stage , neutron stars are still strongly magnetized and rotating objects .",
    "this work treats the motion of a non - rotating magnetized star through the interstellar medium .",
    "treatment of the motion of a rotating star through the ism is discussed by romanova _ _ et al . _ _ ( 2001 ) .",
    "a non - magnetized star moving through the ism captures matter gravitationally from the accretion radius ( e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the normalized velocity of the star , @xmath19 the sound speed of the undisturbed ism , and @xmath20 is the normalized mass of the star .",
    "the mass accretion rate at high mach numbers @xmath21 was derived by hoyle and lyttleton ( 1939 ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass - density of the ism and @xmath24 is the normalized number density . for arbitrary @xmath25 a general formulae",
    "was proposed by bondi ( 1952 ) , @xmath26 where the coefficient @xmath27 is of order unity ( e.g. , bondi proposed @xmath28 , see also ruffert 1994a , b ; pogorelov , ohsugi , & matsuda 2000 ) .",
    "for the case of a moving magnetized star , the standoff distance where the inflowing ism is stopped by the star s @xmath29field is referred to as the alfvn radius @xmath1 . for a relatively weak stellar magnetic field @xmath30 , and in this limit of `` gravitational accretion '' denote the alfvn radius as @xmath31 .",
    "the accretion flow becomes spherically symmetric inside @xmath0 , and one finds @xmath32 ( e.g. , lamb , et al . 1973 ,",
    "lipunov 1992 ) , where @xmath4 is the magnetic field at the surface of the star of radius @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the accretion rate .",
    "if a magnetized star accretes matter with the same rate as a non - magnetized star , @xmath35 , then the alfvn radius is @xmath36 which is about @xmath37 for the adopted reference parameters . here ,",
    "@xmath38 g and @xmath39 cm .    however , there is reason to believe that a _ magnetized _ star accretes matter at a _ lower _ rate than a non - magnetized star for the same @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "our study of spherical bondi accretion has shown that the magnetized star accretes at a lower rate than the same non - magnetized star ( toropin _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , hereafter t99 ) .",
    "the magnetosphere acts as an obstacle for the flow , thus decreasing the rate of spherical accretion compared to the bondi rate @xmath42 . equations ( 28 ) and ( 32 ) of t99 correspond to the approximate dependence @xmath43 for @xmath44 in the range @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is given by equation ( 4 ) with @xmath47 .",
    "thus , for a larger @xmath46 , @xmath34 is smaller and the actual alfvn radius given by equation ( 4 ) is larger .    equation ( 6 ) was deduced from simulations at small values of @xmath48 and therefore it can not be reliably extrapolated to very large values of this ratio .",
    "instead we can write in general @xmath49 where @xmath50 then we find that the actual alfvn radius is @xmath51 .",
    "the two radii , @xmath0 and @xmath52 are equal at @xmath53 for our reference parameters .",
    "it is not known whether accretion can be so strongly inhibited at such small values of @xmath54 .",
    "magnetars have significantly stronger magnetic fields than typical radio pulsars , and consequently most of them are in the `` magnetic plow '' regime .",
    "comparison of equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) shows that @xmath55 if @xmath56 thus , even for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , magnetars are in the magnetic plow regime .    in the `` magnetic plow '' regime ,",
    "the alfvn radius @xmath59 follows from the balance of the magnetic pressure of the star @xmath60 against the ram pressure of the ism which is @xmath61 for mach numbers @xmath62 .",
    "thus @xmath63 the magnetic field strength at this distance from the star is @xmath64 at the boundary between the gravitational and magnetic plow regimes , equations ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 8) coincide . we mention here the important influence of rotation of the star . due to",
    "the rotation the magnetic field decreases with distance @xmath65 at large distances rather than @xmath66 so that the alfvn radius is much larger than one described by equation ( 8) ( romanova _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) .",
    "the velocity distribution of mions and magnetars is unknown , but it is expected to be similar to that of radio pulsars .",
    "pulsars have a wide range of velocities , @xmath67 , with the peak of the distribution at @xmath68 ( cordes & chernoff 1998 ) .",
    "some authors give a smaller value , @xmath69 ( narayan & ostriker 1990 ) while others give larger values , @xmath70 ( hansen & phinney 1997 ) , @xmath71 ( popov _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . for temperatures of the ism , @xmath72 ,",
    "the sound speed of gas is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the mean particle mass , @xmath75 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath76 is the usual specific heat ratio .",
    "thus , the mach number of radio pulsars is in the range @xmath77 with most pulsars having @xmath78 .",
    "the accretion radius @xmath0 depends strongly on the velocity of the star @xmath79 , which may change the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and correspondingly the regime of accretion .",
    "for example , very fast mions with @xmath80 have much smaller accretion radii than slow ones , and may have @xmath81 for wide range of magnetic fields .",
    "it is clear from the range of surface magnetic fields of mions and magnetars and the range of their velocities that different regimes are possible : ( 1 ) the regime of gravitational accretion , @xmath82 ; ( 2 ) the intermediate regime , @xmath83 ; and ( 3 ) the `` magnetic plow '' regime , @xmath84 . in this paper",
    ", we present results for regimes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , which are characterized by formation of extended magnetotails .",
    "regime ( 1 ) will be investigated in a future work .",
    "below , we present numerical model and results of simulations , and return to discuss physical model further in  6 , where the possible observational consequences are considered .",
    "to investigate the interaction of a magnetized star with the ism we use an axisymmetric resistive mhd code and arrange dipole so that its axis is aligned with the matter flow ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the code uses a total variation diminishing ( tvd ) method ( savelyev _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; zhukov _ et al .",
    "the code was used earlier for a study of spherical bondi accretion to a star with dipole magnetic field ( t99 ) .",
    "we used a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath85 with its origin at the star s center .",
    "the @xmath86-axis is parallel to the velocity of the ism at large distances @xmath87 .",
    "the dipole magnetic moment of the star @xmath88 is parallel or antiparallel to the @xmath89axis .",
    "axisymmetry is assumed so that @xmath90 for all scalar variables .",
    "we solve for the vector potential @xmath91 so that the magnetic field @xmath92 automatically satisfies @xmath93 .",
    "the flow is described by the resistive mhd equations , @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 the variables have their usual meanings . the equation of state is @xmath98 , with @xmath76 the specific heat ratio . in the simulations presented here @xmath99 .",
    "the equations incorporate ohm s law @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the electrical conductivity .",
    "the corresponding magnetic diffusivity @xmath102 is taken to be a constant .",
    "the simulations were done inside a `` cylindrical box , '' @xmath103 .",
    "a uniform @xmath104 mesh was used with size @xmath105 the magnetized star was represented by a small cylindrical box with dimensions @xmath106 and @xmath107 , which constitutes the `` numerical star . '' in equation ( 11 ) the gravitational force is due to the star , @xmath108 .",
    "the gravitational force was smoothed for distances inside the region @xmath109 which does not influence the computational results outside of the numerical star .",
    "a point dipole magnetic field @xmath110/{r^5}$ ] with vector - potential @xmath111 was arranged inside numerical star at the radii : @xmath112 .",
    "this dipole field differs from that used in t99 where a small but finite size `` current '' disk was used to produce the dipole field .",
    "a similar model of the field was used by hayashi _",
    "( 1996 ) , miller & stone ( 1997 ) , goodson _",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the vector potential was fixed inside the numerical star and at its surface during the simulations .",
    "these conditions follow from the @xmath113 and @xmath114 boundary conditions on the surface of the perfectly conducting star and protect the magnetic field against numerical decay ( t99 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic variables @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 and @xmath118 were fixed at the surface of the numerical star .",
    "these conditions are similar to the standard `` vacuum '' conditions adopted in hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , ruffert 1994a , b ) .",
    "however , the vacuum is not made too strong because of the difficulty of handling low densities in mhd simulations .",
    "we discuss the boundary conditions on the numerical star further in  4.1 .",
    "we tested the influence of the numerical star shape on our simulation results .",
    "namely , we created an approximation of a sphere on rectangular grid and compared it with the cylindrical star and observed that the difference in the shapes has an insignificant influence on our results .",
    "we put the mhd equations in dimensionless form using the following scalings : the characteristic length is taken to be the bondi radius , @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the sound speed in the undisturbed ism .",
    "temperature is measured in units of @xmath121 , and density in units of @xmath122 .",
    "the magnetic field is measured in units of the reference magnetic field @xmath123 .",
    "a reference speed is the alfvn velocity corresponding to a reference magnetic field @xmath123 and density @xmath122 , @xmath124 .",
    "time is measured in units of @xmath125 , which is the crossing time of the computational region in the absence of a star .",
    "after reduction to dimensionless form , the mhd equations ( 10 ) - ( 13 ) involve three dimensionless parameters , @xmath126    @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the dimensionless magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath129 is the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "note that the first two parameters are dependent because of our choice of the length scale @xmath130 .",
    "the external boundaries of the computational region were treated as follows .",
    "supersonic inflow with mach number @xmath25 was specified at the upstream boundary @xmath131 . at the downstream boundary @xmath132 ,",
    "a `` free boundary '' condition was applied , @xmath133 .",
    "inflow of matter from this boundary into the computational region was forbidden . at the cylindrical boundary @xmath134",
    ", we used the free boundary conditions and in some cases forbid inflow to the computational region .",
    "we observed that the result is very similar in both cases .",
    "we checked the influence of external boundary conditions by performing test simulations at different sizes of the computational region .",
    "the size of the computational region for most of the simulations was @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "the grid @xmath138 was @xmath139 in most of cases .",
    "the radius of the numerical star was @xmath140 in most cases , but test runs were also done for @xmath141 .",
    "a number of different values of @xmath33 were investigated in the purely hydrodynamic simulations ( see  4.1 ) .    for most of our simulation",
    "runs @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , our reference magnetic field @xmath143 is also fixed since @xmath144 is fixed .",
    "thus a useful measure of the strength of the magnetic field is the ratio of the maximum value of the @xmath89component of the field at the point @xmath145 and @xmath146 to @xmath123 .",
    "we denote this dimensionless field as @xmath4 .",
    "we performed simulations for a range of values of @xmath4 .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity was taken to be @xmath147 in most of runs , but the dependence of our solutions on @xmath128 is discussed in  5.2 .    initially , at @xmath148 the magnetic field of the star is a dipole field .",
    "the density and flow velocity are homogeneous in the simulation region : @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we investigate subsequent evolution and follow the evolution as long as it is needed to reach stationarity or quasi - stationarity .",
    "this is typically several dynamical time - scales .",
    "in this section we take the mach number to be relatively small , @xmath3 , so that the accretion radius @xmath0 is of the order of magnitude of the alfvn radius @xmath1 .",
    "first , for reference , we did hydrodynamic simulations of the bhl accretion to a _ non - magnetized _ star for mach number @xmath3 .",
    "we verified that the nature of the flow is close to that described by earlier investigators of hydrodynamic bhl accretion ( e.g. , matsuda _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ; ruffert 1994b ) .",
    "namely , incoming matter forms a conical shock wave around the star . figure 2 shows the main features of the flow at a late time @xmath152 when the flow is stationary .",
    "the opening angle of the shock wave at large distances from the star relative to the @xmath89axis is predicted to be @xmath153 , which is @xmath154 for @xmath3 .",
    "our simulations give @xmath155 , which is larger than predicted .",
    "however , when we performed the simulations in an enlarged region , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , on a grid @xmath159 , we obtained @xmath160 which is close to the theoretical value and similar to the value obtained by ruffert ( 1994b ) .",
    "we calculated the accretion rate @xmath161 to the numerical star and got a value @xmath162 .",
    "we performed simulations using a smaller numerical star @xmath141 and got a slightly smaller value @xmath163 .",
    "this behavior agrees with ruffert s results on the dependence of @xmath164 on numerical star size for the sizes used , @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( ruffert 1994 a , b ) .",
    "this size dependence becomes negligibly small for @xmath167 . in our simulations of accretion to magnetized stars",
    "we take the larger value @xmath168 , because it gives better resolution of the magnetic field near the star .",
    "we compared simulations in the region ( @xmath169 , @xmath170 ) with simulations in twice as smaller region .",
    "this gave only a @xmath171 decrease of accretion rate , which means that our standard region @xmath172 is sufficiently large to accumulate matter from the far distances , though simulations in smaller regions will be also sufficient .",
    "usually , a low pressure is arranged inside the numerical star ( e.g. , ruffert 1994 a , b ) .",
    "however , it is impossible to perform mhd simulations with very low pressure and density inside the numerical star . in our mhd simulations",
    "we have @xmath173 inside the numerical star . to test the influence of this value",
    ", we performed simulations with lower densities inside numerical star , @xmath174 and @xmath175 we observed , that this changed only slightly the accretion rate ( at the level @xmath176 ) .",
    "this is connected with the fact that the matter density which accumulates around the star before accretion is much larger than @xmath177 , so that the difference @xmath178 is about the same for considered values of @xmath177 .",
    "next , we investigated propagation of a _",
    "magnetized _ star through the ism .",
    "simulations were performed for a number of values of the magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "we show results for two cases : for a relatively weak magnetic field , @xmath179 ( where @xmath180 ) ; and for a strong magnetic field , @xmath181 ( where @xmath182 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the main features of the flow for a star with @xmath179 at time @xmath183 when the flow is stationary .",
    "one can see that the magnetic field of the star acts as an obstacle for the flow and a conical shock wave forms as in the hydrodynamic case with similar angle @xmath184 as expected since the mach numbers are the same . magnetic field lines ( with flux values the same as in figure 1 )",
    "are slightly stretched by the flow , but they remain closed .",
    "figure 4 shows the inner region of the flow in greater detail .",
    "the bold line represents the alfvn surface , where the matter energy - density @xmath185 is equal to the magnetic energy - density @xmath186 .",
    "the radius of alfvn surface in @xmath89 direction downstream at @xmath187 is @xmath188 , and in @xmath189 direction at @xmath146 is @xmath190 which is smaller than accretion radius @xmath191 .",
    "thus , some gravitational focusing is expected and indeed we observe density enhancement around the star .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show the distribution of magnetic flux with the lower limit @xmath192 compared to that shown in figures 3 and 4 where @xmath193 .",
    "thus the apparent truncation of the magnetosphere in figures 3 and 4 was connected with choice of minimum plotted magnetic flux .",
    "streamlines of matter flow @xmath194 shown in figures 5 and 6 reveal that matter from radii @xmath195 , accretes to the star , while the rest of matter flies away . compared with the non - magnetized case ,",
    "the magnetic field acts as an obstacle for the flow , and most of the inflowing matter is kept away from the star .",
    "the matter density is strongly enhanced in the shock wave , but gradually decreases as it approaches the surface of the star where it accretes ( figure 7a ) . behind the star ( for @xmath196 )",
    "there is also an accumulation of matter connected with gravitational focusing by a star .",
    "note , that in the case of hydrodynamic accretion , the density jump in front of the star ( at @xmath197 ) is much smaller , while behind the star ( at @xmath198 ) it is much larger .",
    "the velocity @xmath199 ( panel b ) decreases sharply in the shock wave to small subsonic values , but later increases again in the polar column . behind the star the velocity is negative in the small region @xmath200 , where accretion occurs .",
    "the density and velocity jumps in front of the star do not satisfy the standard rankine - hugoniot conditions , because the shock wave is `` attached '' to the magnetosphere .",
    "matter can not move freely after passage through the shock wave , and extra matter accumulation occurs in the shock .    from panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure 7",
    "it is clear that the rate of accretion is smaller in the case of a magnetized star compared to a non - magnetized star .",
    "we observed , that the accretion rate to a magnetized star for @xmath179 is about @xmath201 times smaller than that to a non - magnetized star .",
    "the variations of the of energy - densities along and across the tail ( figure 7c , d ) shows that magnetic energy - density dominates only in a small region around the star .    in case of a stronger magnetic field , @xmath181 ,",
    "larger magnetic flux is stretched downwind ( see figure 8) . gravitational focusing is still important and density enhancement is observed around the star , but it is much smaller , than in case of weaker magnetic field @xmath179 .",
    "now , the alfvn surface has elongated structure and extends all along the @xmath89axis , so that the magnetic energy - density predominates in the tail ( see figure 8) .",
    "the magnetosphere around the star is larger than in the case @xmath179 , and the alfvn radius in @xmath202 direction is @xmath203 , which is larger than accretion radius @xmath204 ( figure 9 ) .",
    "now , all incoming matter goes around the magnetosphere and flies away .",
    "streamlines of the flow ( figure 10 ) show , that no matter goes from the front and accretes to the back side of the star .",
    "a small flux of matter coming from @xmath205 , accretes directly to the upwind pole of the star .",
    "figure 11a shows , that at @xmath181 , compared to @xmath179 , magnetic energy - density predominates in the tail in the region of equatorial plane .",
    "figure 11b and also figure 8 and 9 , show that in @xmath189 direction magnetic energy - density dominates in the tube with radius @xmath206 .",
    "we performed additional simulations for magnetic fields strengths @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 , and derived the dependence of the accretion rate on the magnetic field strength @xmath4 for all cases .",
    "we observed that accretion rate strongly decreases with increasing magnetic field ( see figure 12 ) as @xmath210 .",
    "this dependence reflects the fact that a stronger magnetic field of the star deflects the incoming ism flow more efficiently than weaker magnetic field .",
    "figure 13 shows axial variation of @xmath211 for different values of @xmath4 . in all cases",
    "the magnetic field decreases very gradually with @xmath86 : @xmath212 .",
    "the decrease is partially connected with gradual radial expansion of the magnetosphere , and partially with the reconnection of magnetic field lines in the tail . in the actual flow , the magnetic diffusivity",
    "is expected to be much smaller than that in the code .",
    "this acts to decrease the reconnection rate and increase the length of the tail .",
    "note that the tail of earth s magnetosphere extends to more than a hundred of earth radii ( e.g. , nishida _",
    "the value of the field in the tail is larger for larger values of @xmath4 . even for @xmath179",
    "the magnetic field stretches a long distance downwind from the star .",
    "the alfvn surface in this case is small not only because the magnetic field is weak , but also because matter energy - density is high . at magnetic field strengths",
    "@xmath213 , however , stretching of magnetic field to the tail becomes suppressed .    for @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) ,",
    "the density in the magnetotail is lower than that in the incoming flow @xmath177 and it decreases at higher @xmath4 ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "thus , one can expect hollow magnetic tails in the case of strongly magnetized stars .",
    "this is connected with the fact , that magnetosphere is an obstacle for the flow and the tail represents the rarefaction region which usually forms behind an obstacle in a supersonic flow ( e.g. landau & lifshitz 1960 ) .",
    "furthermore , external matter penetrates only slowly across the magnetotail , because the magnetic diffusion time - scale across the tail is long compared with the transit time of the matter in the @xmath89direction .",
    "in this section we investigate interaction of magnetosphere with the ism in  magnetic plow \" regime , where the alfvn radius @xmath1 is much larger than accretion radius @xmath0 . in this limit",
    "gravitational focusing is unimportant and there is only direct interaction of the ism with magnetosphere of the star . for mach numbers larger than about @xmath217 ( for our set of parameters @xmath4 ) , the flow is in the  magnetic plow \" regime . in this section",
    "we investigate properties of magnetotails at different mach numbers ( @xmath218 ) and different magnetic diffusivities ( @xmath219 ) .      in this subsection",
    "we fix the magnetic field to be @xmath181 and the diffusivity @xmath220 and investigate flows at mach numbers @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "we observed , that at high mach numbers @xmath25 , the sharp density enhancement is observed in the shock cone , while the rest of the tail have low density ( see figures 15 , 16 & 17 ) . at very high mach number @xmath224 ,",
    "some kind of instability appears in the tail which determines its wavy behavior ( figure 17 ) .",
    "this instability may be connected with high velocity gradient across the tail . the alfvn radius in the @xmath202 direction and in the upwind @xmath86 direction decreases at larger @xmath225 ( see also equation 8) , because the flow strips deeper layers of magnetosphere .",
    "this also leads to higher magnetic field in the tail .",
    "reconnection is observed as in case of lower mach numbers . however , the reconnection region is further downwind from the star at higher @xmath225 .",
    "the axial density variations for the three cases are shown at figure 18 .",
    "the case with low mach number @xmath3 is included for reference .",
    "one can see that in case @xmath221 the density in front of the star increases to @xmath226 and then decreases sharply closer to the surface of numerical star . at higher mach numbers , the density peak is lower .",
    "the density behind the star , in the tail , is small @xmath227 .",
    "the density variation across the tail at @xmath228 is shown at figure 19 .",
    "it shows that an essential part of the tail is hollow .",
    "the matter flux @xmath229 is much higher for higher mach numbers ( figure 20 ) , owing to higher velocities .",
    "the instability observed at @xmath224 may be the kelvin - helmholtz instability connected with the large gradient in the flow velocity .",
    "the axial magnetic field decreases slowly with distance behind the star , @xmath230 ( figure 21 ) .",
    "thus , long tails form as in the case @xmath3 .",
    "the magnetic field in the tail is larger at larger mach numbers .",
    "the processes of accretion and reconnection of the magnetic field depend on the magnetic diffusivity @xmath231 .",
    "the fact that our code explicitly includes @xmath232 allows us to investigate the dependence of the flows on the magnitude of this quantity .",
    "this is in contrast with ideal mhd codes where the magnetic diffusivity unavoidably arises from the finite numerical grid . to study the dependence on @xmath232 , we fixed the magnetic field , @xmath181 , and the mach number , @xmath233 .",
    "we made simulation runs for a range of values between @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "we observed that at lower magnetic diffusivity , the magnetic tail ( the alfvn surface ) is wider in the @xmath202 direction . figure 22 shows the variation of @xmath211 across the tail at @xmath228 .",
    "one can see that at small @xmath236 , regions with oppositely directed magnetic field are very close to each other , but do not reconnect . on the other hand , at large @xmath237 , the magnetic field is much smaller , because it annihilates rapidly with distance behind the star .",
    "furthermore , note that at large @xmath231 , matter is partially decoupled from magnetic field and stretching of magnetic field is less efficient .",
    "figure 23 shows the dependence of axial distribution of @xmath211 on @xmath231 .",
    "one can see that at @xmath238 , the magnetic field decreases with @xmath86 very rapidly .",
    "note , that at @xmath239 , numerical diffusivity predominates , and the calculated flows depend only weakly depends on @xmath231 .    the observed behavior is determined by the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath240 where tilde - quantities are our dimensionless variables . for example , for @xmath3 and @xmath179 , in the upwind region of the flow , @xmath241 and most of the matter goes around the dipole and flies away or accretes to the downwind pole . matter which goes to the downwind pole has smaller velocity and hence smaller @xmath129 .",
    "also , when matter diffuses across the tail in the @xmath202 direction owing to gravitational force it has @xmath242 , and @xmath243 .",
    "however , the timescale of the flow in the @xmath89 direction is much less than that in @xmath202 direction , so that most of the matter flies away .",
    "the main conclusion of this subsection is that the magnetotails lengthen as the diffusivity decreases .",
    "comparison with the earth s magnetosphere ( e.g. , nishida _",
    "_ 1998 ) , shows that the actual diffusivity may be smaller than the smallest values used in our simulations .",
    "the question arises , is it possible to observe either a bow shocks or the elongated magnetotails of magnetized old neutron stars or magnetars ? in this section we estimate the powers released and other possible observational features of these objects .",
    "our simulations show that the magnetic field in the tail reconnects .",
    "this phenomenon may lead to acceleration of particles and possible flares in the tail .",
    "the total magnetic energy stored in the tail can be estimated as @xmath244 ^ 2 ~ [ b(z)]^2 , \\eqno(17)\\ ] ] where @xmath245 is the length of the tail , @xmath246 is the radius of the tail at @xmath86 .",
    "the total magnetic flux in , say , the @xmath247 direction along the tail , @xmath248 ^ 2 \\approx b_a \\pi r_a^2~ , \\eqno(18)\\ ] ] is constant in the absence of reconnection . therefore",
    ", if the tail cross - section expands with distance @xmath86 , then the magnetic field decreases as @xmath249 .",
    "the values @xmath1 and @xmath250 we derived earlier [ see equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) ] . we observed that at high mach numbers , the magnetotail expands in the @xmath202 direction very gradually . to estimate the total magnetic energy in a tail of length @xmath245 , we suppose that the tail does not expand , ( @xmath251 ) thus @xmath252 where @xmath253 .",
    "two main physical processes determine the length of the magnetotail .",
    "the first is the stretching of magnetic field lines by the incoming matter flow .",
    "this mechanism operates on the dynamical time - scale , @xmath254 the stretched tail magnetic field has regions of opposite polarity so that the total magnetic flux in the @xmath86 direction is zero . in the axisymmetric case studied here , a cylindrical neutral layer forms .",
    "magnetic field reconnection / annihilation may occur all along this layer . the length @xmath245 of the tail is determined by the competition between stretching and reconnection of the magnetic field . a nominal time - scale for reconnection across the tail",
    "is @xmath255 . in view of equation ( 16 ) , @xmath256 .",
    "a balance between the stretching and diffusion implies that this ration is of order unity . with @xmath257 ,",
    "the average power released by reconnection is @xmath258    next , we estimate the power released in an individual `` flare , '' which is termed a `` substorm '' in the case of the earth s magnetotail . if such a flare occurs in a cylinderical volume @xmath259 , then the energy released is @xmath260 the power of the flare , @xmath261 , depends on the reconnection time - scale @xmath262 , where @xmath263 is alfvn speed .",
    "the alfvn speed is a function of density @xmath23 which is uncertain .",
    "our simulations show that the density in the tail is much lower than the density of incoming ism .",
    "it decreases as the magnetic field @xmath4 increases ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "we have not been able to do simulations for very strong magnetic fields such as those of magnetars .",
    "however , the uncertainty in @xmath264 can be handled by looking at the extreme cases : ( 1 ) a relatively high density tail where @xmath265 ; and ( 2 ) a very low density tail where the alfvn velocity approaches the speed of light @xmath266 .",
    "this density is @xmath267    for the case of a high matter density in the tail , we get @xmath268 and @xmath269 and @xmath270 note , that this power coincides with our estimate [ equation ( 15 ) ] based on the dynamical time - scale .    in the case of low density tail , we find @xmath271 and the power @xmath272 thus , the power released in individual flares is small even in the case of the fastest reconnection rate .",
    "the radiation spectrum of released energy is unknown . in view of the weak magnetic fields in the tail , @xmath273 g , and the possible very low densities",
    ", the energy may go into accelerating electrons which then radiate in the radio band .",
    "part of the power output of a high mach number magnetized star is released in the bow show wave where the heated ism behind the shock radiates .",
    "the total power released at the front part of the shock , @xmath274 , is @xmath275 this power is comparable to the steady power released by reconnection in the magnetotail .",
    "the post shock temperature is @xmath276 which corresponds to x - ray band .",
    "the ism particles excite hydrogen atoms which re - radiate in the optical and uv bands .",
    "thus , one expects radiation from the shock wave from the optical to x - ray bands .      in this paragraph",
    "we give the connection between the simulation parameters and the astrophysical quantities .",
    "the density of the ism is taken as @xmath277 and the sound speed as @xmath120 .",
    "then , from equation ( 14 ) we obtain the reference magnetic field @xmath278 , where @xmath279 .",
    "for example , if the dimensionless field is @xmath4 , then the actual magnetic field is @xmath280 at the radius @xmath281 , which correspond to an external region of the actual magnetosphere .",
    "we can extrapolate this field to smaller radii to get the magnetic field at the surface of the star with radius @xmath282 : @xmath283 .",
    "there are similarities and differences between the supersonic solar wind interaction with the earth s magnetosphere and the interaction of the ism with pulsars .",
    "the magnetization of the solar wind is important for the interaction with the earth s magnetic field .",
    "although not included in the present study , the magnetization of the ism may also be important for the interactions with the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "in contrast with the solar wind -earth interaction , the mach numbers of pulsars vary from @xmath284 to @xmath285 for the fastest pulsars ( cordes & chernoff 1998 ) .",
    "the orientation angles of magnetic axes @xmath184 relative to the propagation direction vary from @xmath286 to @xmath287 .",
    "if the high velocities of some pulsars are connected with initial magnetic or neutrino kicks ( lai , chernoff & cordes 2001 ) , then one may expect this angle to be closer to @xmath288 , similar to that considered in this paper .",
    "the discussed simulations have shown that a long hollow , low - density magnetotail forms behind a high mach number magnetized star .",
    "this fact , and the fact that in the magnetic field lines are highly stretched in the tail , leads to possibility that particles accelerated near the star can preferentially propagate along the tail .",
    "this effect may also be important during pulsar stage .",
    "a pulsar generates a relativistic wind consisting of magnetic field and relativistic particles ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) .",
    "the standoff distance of the shock wave is determined by the total power generated near the light cylinder ( e.g. , cordes _",
    "significant part of energy may be in magnetic field . expanded magnetospheres of pulsars",
    "interact with the ism forming elongated structures but with larger cross - sections compared to non - rotating stars ( romanova _ et al .",
    "accelerated particles will propagate most easily along the tail of the object and may give the object an elongated shape .",
    "an elongated shape is observed around pulsar psr 2224 + 65 in the form of the guitar nebulae ( cordes _ et al .",
    "another elongated pulsar trail was observed in the x - ray band ( wang , li & begelman 1993 ) .",
    "this may be connected with the stretching of magnetic field lines by the ism .",
    "axisymmetric mhd simulations of supersonic motion of a star with an aligned dipole magnetic field through the ism were performed for a wide range of conditions .",
    "we observed , that :        3 .   in the @xmath289 regime ,",
    "some matter accumulates around the star , but most of the matter is deflected by the magnetic field of the star and flies away",
    ". the accretion rate to the star is much smaller than that to a non - magnetized star .",
    "4 .   in the `` magnetic plow '' regime , @xmath81 and at high mach numbers @xmath290 , no matter accumulation is observed around the star .",
    "the density of matter in the tail is very low .",
    "some matter accretes from the upwind pole .    5 .   when @xmath215 , the magnetic energy - density predominates in the magnetotail .",
    "part of this energy may radiate owing to reconnection processes .",
    "the power is however small ( @xmath291 for typical parameters for evolved pulsars and @xmath292 for magnetars ) , so that only the closest magnetars may be possibly observed . for tail magnetic fields @xmath293 , the tail flares or `` substorms '' may give emission in the radio band .      7 .",
    "magnetic tails are expected to also form in case of propagation of pulsars through the ism . in this case particles accelerated by the pulsar",
    "will propagate preferentially along the tail to give an elongated structure .",
