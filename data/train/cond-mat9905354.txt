    "a series of computer simulations performed in the past few years @xcite appear to support the claim that the three - dimensional edwards - anderson spin glass shows signatures of replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) , implying the existence of infinitely many pure states in the low - temperature phase .",
    "in contrast , almost rigorous arguments @xcite and recent experiments @xcite favor the droplet picture @xcite with only one pair of pure states .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have suggested that due to the high temperatures and small system sizes the computer simulations @xcite are strongly affected by the critical point and do not reflect the true low - temperature behaviour .",
    "this suggestion was supported by a numerical calculation of the parisi overlap function using the migdal - kadanoff approximation ( mka ) . for the system sizes and temperatures typically used in computer simulations we found overlap functions similar to those in @xcite , however for lower temperatures we found agreement with the predictions of the droplet picture . that the results of computer simulations are strongly affected by the critical point",
    "can also be concluded from @xcite , where the parisi overlap function shows critical scaling ( with effective exponents ) down to temperatures @xmath0 .    in recent publications @xcite ,",
    "it is claimed that nontrivial behaviour of a quantity called the link overlap is a reliable indicator of rsb .",
    "however , in order to place such a claim on solid ground , one would have to show that the data can not be interpreted within the framework of the droplet picture .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to furnish this discussion which has been missing so far . as in @xcite",
    ", we use the mka which is known to agree with the droplet picture .",
    "our results show , as in the case of the parisi overlap function , that several nontrivial features attributed to rsb are in fact due to finite - size effects , and that the numerical data on the link overlap published so far are indeed in agreement with the droplet picture .",
    "we also derive expressions for the effective coupling at any temperature as a function of system size and find that one indeed needs rather large systems or low temperatures to see droplet - like behaviour .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : after introducing the model and defining the quantities to be evaluated , we present first our analytical and numerical results for the link overlap distribution function . then , we evaluate the link overlap in the presence of a weak coupling between the two replicas . in the following section",
    "we explain why finite size effects are so large for the three  dimensional ising spin glass .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our findings .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath1 of the edwards - anderson ( ea ) spin glass in the absence of an external magnetic field is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "the ising spins can take the values @xmath4 , and the nearest - neighbour couplings @xmath5 are independent from each other and gaussian distributed with a standard deviation @xmath6 .",
    "it has proven useful to consider two identical copies ( replicas ) of the system , and to measure overlaps between them .",
    "this gives information about the structure of the low - temperature phase , in particular about the number of pure states .",
    "the quantity considered in this paper is the link overlap @xmath7 where the sum is over all nearest - neighbour pairs @xmath8 of a lattice with @xmath9 bonds and @xmath10 sites , and the brackets denote the thermal and disorder average . @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the spins in the two replicas .",
    "the hamiltonian used for the evaluation of the thermodynamic average is @xmath13 = \\beta h_0 [ \\sigma]+\\beta h_0",
    "[ \\tau]- \\epsilon\\sum_{\\langle i , j\\rangle } \\sigma_i \\sigma_{j } \\tau_i \\tau_{j}\\ , , \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the ordinary spin glass hamiltonian given above , and the term in @xmath14 introduces a coupling between the two replicas .    in cases",
    "where the random couplings @xmath5 are taken to have the values @xmath15 , the link overlap is identical to the energy overlap .",
    "the main qualitative differences between the parisi overlap @xmath16 and the link overlap are ( i ) that flipping all spins in one of the two replicas changes the sign of @xmath17 but leaves @xmath18 invariant , and ( ii ) that flipping a droplet of finite size in one of the two replicas changes @xmath17 by an amount proportional to the volume of the droplet , and @xmath18 by an amount proportional to the surface of the droplet .",
    "below , we will show that , just as for the parisi overlap , the mka can reproduce all the essential features of the link overlap found in monte carlo simulations .",
    "these results refute the claim made in @xcite that the agreement between the mka and simulations for the parisi overlap reported in @xcite is a mere coincidence that does not extend to the link overlap .",
    "the conclusion must be drawn that there is no evidence for rsb in three dimensional ising spin glasses .    evaluating a thermodynamic quantity in mka in three dimensions",
    "is equivalent to evaluating it on a hierarchical lattice that is constructed iteratively by replacing each bond by eight bonds , as indicated in fig .",
    "the total number of bonds after @xmath19 iterations is @xmath20 , which is identical to the number of lattice sites of a three - dimensional lattice of size @xmath21 .",
    "thermodynamic quantities are then evaluated iteratively by tracing over the spins on the highest level of the hierarchy , until the lowest level is reached and the trace over the remaining two spins is calculated @xcite .",
    "this procedure generates new effective couplings , which have to be included in the recursion relations . in @xcite",
    ", it was proved that in the limit of infinitely many dimensions ( and in an expansion away from infinite dimensions ) the mka reproduces the results of the droplet picture .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the mka agrees with the droplet picture in three dimensions as well .",
    "for this reason , no feature that is seen in mka can be attributed to rsb .",
    "we first set the coupling strength @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) to zero and study the probability distribution @xmath22 of the link overlap , averaged over a sufficiently large number of samples .",
    "rsb should manifest itself in @xmath22 according to @xcite in an asymmetric ( non - gaussian ) shape and a nonzero width even at infinitely large system sizes .",
    "furthermore , the link overlap for single samples should show large variations between different samples . here , we show that the asymmetric shape and large sample to sample variations can even be seen in mka for moderate system sizes and can therefore not be taken as evidence for rsb .",
    "the only reliable indicator for rsb would be a width of @xmath22 that does not shrink with increasing system size .",
    "however , the only monte carlo simulation data published so far for @xmath22 @xcite are taken for a four - dimensional ising spin glass in a magnetic field , and they show a shrinking width , in agreement with the expectations from the droplet picture .",
    "we have obtained the function @xmath22 by first calculating its fourier transform , @xmath23 the coefficients @xmath24 in @xmath25 are then found from @xmath26 : @xmath27    figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show our result for @xmath22 in mka for three different temperatures .",
    "all curves have been averaged over several thousand samples .",
    "= 0.7    = 0.7    = 0.7    the curves for small @xmath28 are asymmetric at @xmath29 with a tail on the right - hand side . with decreasing temperature ,",
    "the asymmetry becomes stronger , the tail moves to the left - hand side , and a shoulder is formed .",
    "all these features seem to be finite - size effects , as they become weaker with increasing system size .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show @xmath22 for single samples at @xmath30 and for @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "= 0.7    = 0.7    in particular for @xmath31 , there are large variations between different samples , a feature that is usually assumed to be a clear indicator of rsb . however , since the mka does not show rsb , we must asign this feature to finite - size effects .    finally , let us study the width @xmath33 of @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows our results on a double logarithmic plot , together with a power - law fit @xmath34 .",
    "= 0.7    at @xmath29 , the exponent @xmath35 is sufficiently close to @xmath36 to suggest that the leading contribution to @xmath37 comes from the superposition of independent contributions of the different parts of the system , just as it does for higher temperatures .",
    "below , we shall see explicitely that critical point nonanalyticities are indeed subleading to the regular contributions .    within the framework of the droplet picture ,",
    "the value of @xmath35 at the zero temperature fixed point can be calculated as follows : the main excitations at low temperatures or large scales are droplets of flipped spins of a radius @xmath38 in one of the replicas .",
    "such droplets occur with a probability proportional to @xmath39 and each of them makes a contribution of the order @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the fractal dimension of the droplet surface and is @xmath43 in mka , and @xmath44 is the scaling exponent of the coupling strength and has a value around 0.24 in mka in @xmath45 .",
    "we therefore find @xmath46 giving @xmath47 in mka . our above data for @xmath48",
    "are not far from this result . for larger system size",
    ", they must ultimately converge to it .",
    "just as in the case of the parisi overlap @xcite , the crossover from critical to low - temperature behaviour is so slow that even for @xmath49 the asymptotic regime is not reached for system sizes up to 32 , and the curves appear to show effective exponents .    for a cubic lattice , we have @xmath50 and @xmath51 , predicting a value @xmath52 within the framework of the droplet picture .",
    "this has to be compared to the rsb scenario , where @xmath53 . in @xcite",
    ", it is claimed that monte - carlo simulation data at @xmath54 and @xmath55 show already the signatures of rsb .",
    "however , as yet there is no published data for @xmath56 . only if a value of @xmath35 smaller than 0.9 is found",
    ", one can conclude that the droplet picture is inappropriate and that rsb occurs . as long as @xmath35 appears to be larger than 0.9 ,",
    "the data are compatible with the droplet picture and are affected by finite - size effects .",
    "in @xcite , the authors suggested studying the expectation value of the link overlap in the presence of a coupling between the two replicas , @xmath57 , in order to test whether a system shows rsb . a positive coupling @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) favours a configuration where both replicas are in the same state , while a negative @xmath14 favours configurations with smaller overlaps . if the rsb scenario were correct , the distribution @xmath22 would have a finite width even for @xmath58 and range from some minimum value @xmath59 to a maximum value @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , the expectation value of the link overlap , @xmath57 , would have a jump from @xmath59 to @xmath60 at @xmath61 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , as we will show next , the droplet picture predicts a continuous and at @xmath61 nonanalytic function @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "part of these results were published in @xcite .    within the droplet picture , the scaling dimension of @xmath14 in the spin glass phase",
    "can easily be obtained . at length scale 1",
    ", @xmath14 is equivalent to the energy cost of flipping one spin in one of the two replicas . on a scale @xmath62 ,",
    "this becomes the energy cost of flipping a droplet of radius @xmath62 in one of the replicas , which is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "the scaling dimension of @xmath14 is therefore @xmath42 , where @xmath42 is the fractal dimension of the droplet surface .",
    "equivalently , @xmath42 is the fractal dimension of a domain wall . within mka",
    ", we have @xmath64 . the same value @xmath43 for the scaling dimension of @xmath14 is also obtained from an analytical calculation of the recursion relations for @xmath14 and the strength @xmath6 of the random couplings near the @xmath65 fixed point .",
    "the positive dimension of @xmath14 implies that the coupling between the two replicas is a relevant perturbation and that on large scales a behaviour different from that of an independent system can be seen .",
    "when @xmath14 is positive , the energy cost @xmath66 for the excitation of droplets of radius @xmath62 leads to the suppression of droplets larger than @xmath67 on scales beyond @xmath68 , droplet excitations must occur in both replicas simultaneously .",
    "this costs twice the energy of a single droplet in an independent system .",
    "the coupled system thus behaves on large scales exactly like a single system with twice the coupling strength @xmath6 .    as stated in the preceding section , for @xmath61 droplets of size @xmath62",
    "occur with a probability proportional to @xmath69 in a system of size @xmath28 .",
    "since for positive @xmath14 droplets of size greater than @xmath68 are suppressed , the change in the link overlap due to a small positive @xmath14 can be written as @xmath70 in order to suppress each droplet only once , the sum must be taken over distinct length scales @xmath62 , e.g. , @xmath71 , and it is proportional to the first term .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath72 , and using the expression for @xmath68 given above we have , @xmath73    for negative @xmath14 , flipping a droplet of radius @xmath62 in one of the replicas changes the system s energy by an amount proportional to @xmath74 , which is negative for @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , there is a proliferation of droplets beyond this length scale and the spin glass state is completely restructured .",
    "we followed the flow of the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath6 , and @xmath77 ( the width of the distribution of @xmath14 ) under a change of scale in the mka and found that @xmath77 diverges , while @xmath6 and @xmath14 eventually decrease to zero .",
    "such a system is an edwards - anderson spin glass with the effective spins @xmath78 .    since droplets of size larger than @xmath79",
    "proliferate for negative @xmath14 , the change in the link overlap is given in this case by @xmath80    we thus find that @xmath81 has the form @xmath82 , with values @xmath83 and @xmath84 that depend on the sign of @xmath14 . within mka , it is @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . for a cubic lattice , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "for finite temperatures and small systems , there are corrections to this asymptotic behaviour due to finite - size effects which replace the nonanalyticity at @xmath61 with a linear behaviour for small @xmath89 , and due to the influence of the critical fixed point , where the leading behaviour is linear in @xmath14 ( see below ) .",
    "as we have argued in @xcite , the influence of the critical fixed point changes the apparent value of the low - temperature exponents for the system sizes studied in monte - carlo simulations and the mka .",
    "the data shown in @xcite with an apparent value of 0.5 for @xmath90 are fully compatible with the above predictions of the droplet picture .",
    "there is no indication of a jump at @xmath61 in @xmath57 , which would be the signature of rsb . for the mka ,",
    "the apparent exponent at @xmath91 is close to 1 for @xmath92 , leading to the `` trivial '' behaviour found in @xcite .",
    "however , at lower temperatures , for the same small system sizes the above - mentioned nontrivial features predicted by the droplet picture become clearly visible , as shown in fig .",
    "[ qle ] .",
    "= 0.75    let us conclude this section with a discussion of the link overlap at the critical temperature .",
    "[ qlcrit ] shows our result in mka .",
    "= 0.75    clearly , the curves are linear at @xmath61 , indicating that the regular part dominates over the singular , critical contribution .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by studying the scaling dimension of @xmath14 at @xmath93 . iterating the recursion relations for the coupling constants",
    ", we find that under a change in length scale , @xmath94 , we obtain @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "now , @xmath57 can be obtained from the free energy via the relation @xmath97 implying a scaling behaviour @xmath98 .",
    "substituting @xmath99 with @xmath14 gives then the relation @xmath100 compared to the linear regular part , this singular dependence can not be seen for small @xmath14 .",
    "as we have argued throughout this paper and in earlier work @xcite @xcite , finite size effects appear to be large for the ising spin glass in three dimensions .",
    "to understand this behaviour , we iterated the mk recursion relations starting at various temperatures below @xmath93 . in fig.[fig9 ] the solid lines",
    "show the data for @xmath101 as a function @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the number of iterations of the mk recursion relations . for large l",
    ", one expects @xmath104 .",
    "however , it is apparent that even at @xmath105 one needs system sizes @xmath106 to see this behaviour . because the change in the slope @xmath107 is so slow",
    ", @xmath108 appears to be described by a power law with some effective exponent over small windows of one decade in @xmath28 , just as we found for @xmath109 in @xcite . to understand the large crossover regime",
    ", we consider an expansion around the zero - temperature fixed point , where the effective temperature @xmath110 at a length scale @xmath28 can be written as @xmath111 where a , b , ... are constants and even order terms are absent because @xmath112 ( or @xmath113 ) is a symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "now , @xmath45 is close to the lower critical dimension for ising spin glasses ( so that @xmath93 is in some sense small ) , and one might expect that truncating the above equation after the first few terms will give a good approximation for @xmath114 or equivalently @xmath6 throughout the low temperature phase .",
    "we now show that this is indeed the case : keeping terms up to @xmath115 gives a good description of the mk data of fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "the analysis is as follows : at @xmath93 , @xmath116 so that @xmath117 . for small deviations away from @xmath93 i.e.",
    "@xmath118 , the correlation length exponent @xmath119 is defined via @xmath120 , leading to @xmath121 . solving for @xmath83 and @xmath122 in terms of @xmath119 , @xmath44 and @xmath93 , we find @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "now we substitute these expressions into the above equation and integrate from a length scale @xmath125 ( temperature @xmath126 ) to a length scale @xmath28 ( temperature @xmath127 ) to get an equation relating @xmath127 to @xmath126 .",
    "then using @xmath128 gives the corresponding equation for @xmath129 .",
    "setting @xmath130 and @xmath131 , we find @xmath132 ^{(x-1 ) } } } = { ( j_0 ^ 2-j_c^2)^x \\over{\\left[j_0 ^ 2-{x-1\\over x}j_c^2\\right ] ^{(x-1 ) } } } 2^{2n\\theta } , \\label{jn}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the coupling at the starting point @xmath134 and @xmath135 is the coupling after @xmath103 iterations .    to test whether eq .  ( [ jn ] ) is a good approximation , we have inserted the values @xmath101 obtained from the mk recursion relations into the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ jn ] ) .",
    "we have chosen @xmath136 and @xmath137 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the result are the data points given in fig .",
    "they satisfy a power law with exponent @xmath138 and a prefactor @xmath139 , showing that eq .",
    "( [ jn ] ) is indeed an appropriate description of the growth of the coupling throughout the low temperature phase .",
    "now , for large @xmath135 and @xmath133 , eq .  ( [ jn ] ) reduces to pure power law behaviour viz . @xmath140 and",
    "the crossover length for the different temperatures can be read off as the length for which @xmath141 becomes of the same order as @xmath101 . beyond the crossover length",
    ", we should see the correct low - temperature exponents .",
    "= 0.7    thus , we have seen that the three - dimensional spin glass in mka can be well described by an approximation that is valid close to the lower critical dimension and that shows explicitely that crossover scales are large .",
    "the analysis described above is quite general and should be applicable also to the ising spin glass on a cubic lattice .",
    "there is one caveat however : the analysis we have carried out is valid for the couplings alone",
    ". other quantities ( for example @xmath142 or @xmath22 ) would have to be studied separately and it is possible that the crossover lengths would be somewhat different for different quantities .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the link overlap between two identical replicas of a three - dimensional ising spin glass in migdal - kadanoff approximation .",
    "the width of the link overlap distribution decreases to zero with increasing system size at @xmath93 as well as in the low - temperature phase .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the predictions of the droplet picture . for system sizes similar to the ones used in monte carlo simulations of a cubic lattice ,",
    "we find the same large sample - to - sample fluctuations and asymmetric curve shapes as reported from those simulations . they must be interpreted as a finite - size effect and can not be taken as an indicator for replica - symmetry breaking .",
    "the only reliable indicator for rsb would be a width of the overlap distribution that does not decrease with increasing system size .",
    "similarly , the link overlap in the presence of a weak coupling between the two replicas shows in mka in the spin glass phase the singular behaviour predicted by the droplet picture .",
    "data from monte carlo simulations are also in full agreement with the droplet picture .",
    "the rsb picture predicts a jump in the mean value of the link overlap at zero coupling strength that is not visible in monte carlo simulation data published so far .",
    "we have reproduced phenomenologically the influence of the critical point on the growth of the coupling constants using an approximation that is valid close to the lower critical dimension .",
    "this gives us a direct estimate of the lengthscale at any given temperature beyond which one needs to go in order to see zero - temperature ( droplet ) scaling without crossover effects from critical point behaviour intruding too strongly .",
    "this crossover effect often seems to get overlooked in the literature .",
    "for example komori , yoshino and takayama @xcite in a numerical simulation of the ising spin glass at a temperature of @xmath143 found that critical scaling of the dynamics worked well : they found that correlation data at time @xmath144 could be collapsed for systems of linear dimension @xmath28 for values of @xmath28 up to 7 , by plotting against the variable @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is similar to the critical point dynamical exponent .",
    "this behaviour was interpreted by marinari , parisi and ruiz - lorenzo @xcite as evidence against droplet scaling but it is clear from our work that for the system sizes studied at temperatures so close to @xmath93 droplet scaling would be quite unobservable and that critical point scaling should indeed work quite well .",
    "we therefore conclude that the droplet picture , combined with finite - size effects , can fully explain all data for the link overlap in the ising spin glass .",
