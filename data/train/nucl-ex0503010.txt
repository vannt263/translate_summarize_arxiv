    "the primary goal of the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) is to create and study matter at extremely high energy density .",
    "it is hypothesized that at the energy densities reached in central au+au reactions at rhic , the matter created is composed of de - confined colored objects  @xcite .",
    "a summary of the results and opinions of the four experimental collaborations on the status of achieving this goal can be found in their  white papers \" @xcite .",
    "we expect that the signals of any de - confined phase should become stronger as the overlapped region increases in au+au collisions .",
    "testing this hypothesis requires studying particle production as a function of centrality .",
    "the particle distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity may provide a key to understanding any non - hadronic effects that might appear in central nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons are the most abundantly produced particles in the high - energy heavy - ion collisions , and they carry information about the bulk properties of the nuclear matter created from the collisions .",
    "pions , being the lightest of the produced hadrons are thus the most copiously produced , and their numbers can be related to the entropy density of the emitting source .",
    "kaons carry a significant fraction of the total strangeness produced  @xcite .",
    "protons and antiprotons provide an experimental tool for measuring baryon production and allow us to explore baryon transport from beam rapidity toward midrapidity  @xcite . the global thermodynamic properties and collective motion of the system at the kinetic freeze - out point",
    "can be deduced , albeit , in a model dependent way , from transverse momentum spectra as a function of rapidity and centrality  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present transverse momentum spectra , yields , and ratios for identified charged hadrons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) obtained with the brahms mid - rapidity spectrometer . we have measured these spectra for @xmath5 and @xmath6 as a function of collision centrality . at midrapidity ,",
    "our observations are in agreement with the result of the phenix experiment  @xcite within systematic uncertainties .",
    "the data presented here are available at  @xcite .",
    "the brahms experiment consists of two movable magnetic spectrometer arms , the mid - rapidity spectrometer ( mrs ) and the forward spectrometer , and global detectors for event characterization .    in order to characterize the centrality of collisions , a multiplicity array ( ma ) consisting of a coaxial arrangement of si strip detectors and scintillator tiles surrounding the intersection region",
    "is employed .",
    "the si strip detectors and scintillator tiles give independent measurement of charged - particle multiplicities allowing the two measurements to be averaged in the final determination .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity coverage of the ma is approximately @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the centrality selection is obtained by developing minimum - bias trigger events , which are defined using two zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) , requiring energy deposit equivalent to at least one neutron in each of the two detectors and also requiring a signal in the ma to reject coulomb dissociation events  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : mult ] shows the charged - particle multiplicity distribution for minimum - bias events in the range of @xmath7 .",
    "the lines on the plot indicate four centrality windows in the analysis , 0@xmath810% , 10@xmath820% , 20@xmath840% , and 40@xmath860% , where 0% corresponds to the most central events .        the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath9 ) in table  [ tab : npart ] are estimated using the glauber monte - carlo hijing calculation  @xcite .",
