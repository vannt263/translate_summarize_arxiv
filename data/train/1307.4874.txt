    "the _ kepler _ space telescope is designed to detect the periodic transits of exoplanets in front of their host stars . based on the data obtained during the first 16 months of kepler s operation , more than 2000 planetary candidates have been identified , analyzed , and published @xcite .",
    "most of these planetary candidates have radii in the range 14 times that of the earth ( @xmath0 ) and orbital periods @xmath1 less than a few months .",
    "the rarity of planets with smaller radii and longer periods is due to observational selection effects .",
    "although a large fraction of these candidates may indeed be planets , some of them may be due to the blending of background eclipsing binary stars with the light of foreground stars .    in the @xmath2-month kepler catalog , there are 361 host stars which bear two or more transiting planetary candidates @xcite , and almost all of them are real multiple - planet systems @xcite .",
    "their orbital configurations contain valuable information on the history of their formation and dynamical evolution .",
    "in particular , although a majority of the planet pairs are not in or near mean - motion resonances , there is an excess of planet pairs with outer - to - inner orbital period ratios , @xmath3 , just wide of first - order 2:1 and 3:2 resonances and a deficit of pairs with @xmath3 just smaller than 2:1 and 3:2 @xcite .",
    "the excess and deficit occur within a few percent of exact commensurabilities .",
    "figure [ fig : histogram ] shows the histogram of period ratio for all kepler candidate pairs , pairs with radius of the inner planet @xmath4 ( earths and super - earths ) , and pairs with @xmath5 ( neptunes and above ) .",
    "both pairs with @xmath6 , and pairs with @xmath5 show an excess for @xmath3 just larger than 3:2 and a deficit just smaller than 2:1 , but interestingly , there is not an obvious excess just larger than 2:1 for pairs with @xmath6 ( although the statistics is noisy due to small numbers ) . also , the lack of pairs with @xmath3 just smaller than 3:2 reported by @xcite is not noticeable in figure [ fig : histogram ] , because the bin size ( @xmath7 ) is large compared to the width of the gap ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) .",
    "( as well as all pairs ) for the bin in figure [ fig : histogram ] centered at @xmath10 , which is just wide of the second - order 5:3 resonance , is likely an artifact , as there are no longer obvious features around 5:3 when we shift the bins by , e.g. , @xmath9 in @xmath3 . ]",
    "the kepler candidates should be contrasted with the radial velocity sample , which also shows an excess of planet pairs near the 2:1 resonance .",
    "the radial - velocity planets are mostly jupiter - mass planets , and the excess near the 2:1 resonance consists of confirmed ( or likely ) resonant pairs such as gj  876 @xcite and hd  82943 @xcite .",
    "a widely accepted hypothesis for the origin of such resonances is resonance capture through convergent migration of the planets @xcite .",
    "tidal interaction between an embedded planet and its natal protoplanetary disk generally leads to a torque imbalance @xcite .",
    "jupiter - mass planets are able to open gaps in the disks , and they generally evolve with the viscous diffusion of their natal disks and undergo inward type ii migration ( except in the outermost regions of the disk where the disk spreads viscously outward and the migration is outward ) @xcite .",
    "convergent migration occurs if the inward migration of the outer planet proceeds faster than that of the inner planet and the outer - to - inner period ratio , @xmath3 , decreases .",
    "lower - mass planets , like most of the kepler candidates , do not significantly perturb the disk surface density distribution , and thus they undergo type i migration . the direction of type i migration is expected to be inward in the classic theory of , e.g. , @xcite , but more recent analysis have shown that type i migration could be outward in the viscously heated regions of some disk models @xcite .",
    "tidal interactions also occur between planets and their host stars , which generally lead toward a state of spin synchronization and orbital circularization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the host spins with a frequency faster ( slower ) than its companion s orbital mean motion , the dissipation of the tides raised by the companion in the host would reduce ( increase ) the host s spin frequency and increase ( decrease ) the companion s orbital semimajor axis on a timescale which is determined by the host s @xmath11 value , where @xmath12 is the tidal dissipation function and @xmath13 is the love number .",
    "the companion s eccentricity is generally damped by the dissipation of the tides raised by the host in the companion on a timescale which is determined by the companion s @xmath11 value .    in this paper",
    ", we consider in detail a scenario which may account for the kepler near - resonance planet pairs .",
    "pairs of planets were captured into first - order resonances by convergent migration due to planet - disk interactions , and subsequently became detached from the resonances due to tidal dissipation in the planets .",
    "the latter process was proposed by @xcite and more recently by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in section 2",
    ", we give a simple explanation why the period ratio @xmath3 should in fact be slightly larger than the exact period ratio for a first - order resonance , if both resonance angles are librating .",
    "we then show that classic type i migration should result in resonant pairs with @xmath3 much closer to exact commensurability than the few percent departures observed for the kepler near - resonance pairs .",
    "subsequent tidal damping of eccentricity and evolution away from exact commensurability are discussed in section 3 , along with known constraints on @xmath11 for rocky and giant planets .",
    "comparisons with the observed kepler near - resonance pairs are used to derive constraints on @xmath11 and the rocky / giant nature of the kepler planets in section 4 .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in section 5 .",
    "for first - order , @xmath14:@xmath15 , mean - motion resonances like 2:1 and 3:2 , there are two eccentricity - type resonance angles , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mean longitude of planet @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the longitude of periapse ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the inner and outer planets , respectively ) .",
    "at least one of these angles must librate about a fixed value for the pair to be in resonance , if we ignore inclination resonances .",
    "the resonance induced periapse precession is usually _ retrograde _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath22 ( see below ) . in the best example of a mean - motion resonance in extrasolar planetary systems , the 2:1 resonance in gj 876 , both angles librate about @xmath23 , and the periapses",
    "are observed to precess at an average rate of @xmath24yr@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "if the resonance angle @xmath26 is librating , @xmath27 on average , or @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean motion , @xmath30 is the orbital period , and @xmath22 due to the resonance .",
    "so @xmath3 should in fact be slightly larger than the exact period ratio for a resonant pair .    in the vicinity of a @xmath14:@xmath15 resonance ,",
    "the hamiltonian to the lowest order in the orbital eccentricities @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the stellar mass , @xmath34 is the planetary mass , and @xmath35 is the orbital semimajor axis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the laplace coefficient , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the kronecker delta . for 2:1 ,",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 . for 3:2 ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the first two terms of the hamiltonian are the unperturbed keplerian hamiltonian and the remaining terms are the resonant interactions .",
    "the equation for the variation of the periapse longitude is @xmath46 if we assume coplanar orbits .",
    "since libration of @xmath47 about @xmath23 and @xmath48 about @xmath49 is the only stable resonance configuration for small eccentricities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 to the lowest order in eccentricities . thus @xmath52 and @xmath53 could be large and positive , if the eccentricities are small .",
    "this is different from higher - order resonances .",
    "for example , for a second - order resonance , the resonant terms in the hamiltonian to the lowest order in the eccentricities are proportional to @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 involves terms that are either independent of the eccentricities or proportional to @xmath58 ( similarly , @xmath59 for @xmath60 ) .",
    "we can derive two simple relationships between the eccentricities and the period ratio from the above expressions for @xmath57 and @xmath60 . from the requirement that both orbits precess at the same rate on average , i.e. , @xmath61 , @xmath62 @xcite . substituting @xmath57 into equation ( [ eq : pratio ] ) , @xmath63 in the above equations , @xmath64^{2/3}$ ] .",
    "convergent migration of planets due to interactions with the protoplanetary disk can result in capture into mean - motion resonances .",
    "this is the most likely scenario for the origin of the 2:1 resonance in the gj 876 system @xcite .",
    "if the growth of eccentricity due to continued migration within the resonance is balanced by the damping of eccentricity by planet - disk interactions , the eccentricities would reach equilibrium values determined by the ratio of the rates of eccentricity damping and migration .",
    "a natural question arises as to whether the kepler near - resonance pairs are simply resonance pairs with very small eccentricities ( and hence large positive departure of @xmath3 from exact commensurability ) due to large eccentricity damping during disk - induced migration .",
    "most of the kepler candidate planets are sufficiently small that they are unable to open gaps in the protoplanetary disks and should undergo type i migration . for _ classic _ type i migration , the migration rate is @xcite @xmath65 and the eccentricity damping rate is @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the planetary mass , @xmath70 is the surface mass density of the disk , and @xmath71 is the dimensionless scale height of the disk .",
    "the ratio @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "we have performed direct numerical orbit integrations using the symplectic integrator symba modified to include forced migration and eccentricity damping @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : capture ] shows a convergent migration calculation with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the planets are initially far from the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability , and the outer planet is forced to migrate inward with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the pair is captured into 2:1 resonance with both @xmath47 and @xmath48 librating .",
    "the centers of libration change from @xmath81 and @xmath82 at small eccentricities to close to @xmath83 at large eccentricities ( with the offsets from @xmath23 due to the forced migration and eccentricity damping ) .",
    "the eccentricities reach equilibrium values that are too large ( @xmath84 ) , and @xmath3 departs from 2 by less than @xmath85 at the end .",
    "this result is representative of calculations with @xmath86 for both 2:1 and 3:2 .",
    "hence the kepler near - resonance pairs are _ not _ the result of eccentricity damping within the expected range during disk - induced classic type i migration .",
    "it has been proposed that the subsequent damping of orbital eccentricities by tidal dissipation in the planets may reduce the eccentricities to sufficiently small values to explain the observed departures from exact commensurabilities @xcite .",
    "tidal dissipation in the planet damps the orbital eccentricity on timescale @xmath87 while conserving the total angular momentum of the system , where @xmath88 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the radius , tidal dissipation function , and love number of the planet of mass @xmath69 .",
    "the above equation assumes that the planet is synchronously rotating and that @xmath12 is constant as a function of the tidal frequencies .",
    "since @xmath89 is independent of @xmath90 and @xmath91 changes only slightly for small @xmath90 , one would expect @xmath90 to decay exponentially .",
    "however , as we now demonstrate , the eccentricities do _ not _ decay exponentially for near - resonance pairs due to interactions between the planets : they decay slowly according to a shallow power law .    using migration calculations with eccentricity damping similar to that shown in figure [ fig : capture ] ,",
    "we have assembled several 2:1 and 3:2 configurations with @xmath77 and different @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these configurations were then evolved in calculations where the eccentricity of the inner planet is damped on a constant timescale @xmath94 ( while the semimajor axis of the inner planet is adjusted at the same time to conserve orbital angular momentum ) to simulate tidal dissipation in the inner planet .",
    "we ignore tidal dissipation in the outer planet as the rate is a steep function of semimajor axis ( equation ( [ eq : taue ] ) ) .",
    "the results are plotted in figures [ fig : e1dp32 ] and [ fig : e1dp21 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : e1dp32 ] for 3:2 , the dashed , solid , and dot - dashed lines are for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : e1dp21 ] for 2:1 , the dashed , solid , and dot - dashed lines are for @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "the figures show that @xmath102 and @xmath103 after an initial transient period of a few @xmath94 .",
    "we have checked that the relationships in equations ( [ eq : e2e1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pratioe1 ] ) are satisfied during the power - law decay .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have explained this power - law behavior ( see also @xcite ) and derived analytically @xmath104 as a function of @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the @xmath14:@xmath15 resonance : @xmath107 where @xmath108 the dotted lines in figures [ fig : e1dp32 ] and [ fig : e1dp21 ] show the analytic result , which is in excellent agreement with the numerical results after the initial transient period .",
    "we have so far assumed that tidal dissipation in the inner planet conserves the orbital angular momentum .",
    "strictly speaking , tidal dissipation conserves the total angular momentum , which includes the spin angular momentum .",
    "there is a small change in @xmath104 if we account for the tidal evolution of the planet s spin .",
    "we have also ignored the tidal dissipation in the outer planet , which adds to @xmath109 but does not change the @xmath110 power - law behavior @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of this slow power - law behavior is that many @xmath94 must elapse to produce a departure of @xmath3 of a few percent from exact commensurability .",
    "for example , @xmath111 requires @xmath112 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : e1dp32 ] and [ fig : e1dp21 ] ) . for @xmath113days , @xmath77 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116",
    "whether a near - resonance pair can reach its @xmath53 within the age of its host star ( @xmath117 a few gyr ) depends critically on @xmath11 of the inner planet , which is very different for rocky and giant planets , as we now review .",
    "the tidal @xmath11 of solar system planets have been measured or constrained by the tidal evolution of their satellites .",
    "the known value and limit on @xmath11 for rocky planets are @xmath119 for earth @xcite and @xmath120 for mars @xcite .",
    "the known limits on @xmath11 for giant planets are : @xmath121 for jupiter @xcite , @xmath122 for saturn @xcite , @xmath123 for uranus @xcite , and @xmath124 for neptune @xcite . for extrasolar giant planets ,",
    "@xmath125 has been derived from the existence of some close - in planets with non - zero orbital eccentricities @xcite .",
    "so the _ lowest _ bound on @xmath11 is @xmath126 for rocky planets from earth and @xmath127 for giant planets from neptune .",
    "if we substitute these lowest bounds into the estimate in equation ( [ eq : taue2 ] ) , we find @xmath128 for rocky planets and",
    "@xmath129 for giant planets , which indicate that a near - resonance pair might be able to reach its @xmath53 over the age of its host star , if the inner planet is rocky ( and not if the inner planet is a giant ) .",
    "figure [ fig : taue ] shows the tidal eccentricity damping timescale @xmath130 ( equation ( [ eq : taue ] ) ) of the inner planet for the kepler candidate pairs near the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances .",
    "circles are adjacent pairs , and triangles are non - adjacent pairs . filled and open symbols are pairs with the radius of the inner planet @xmath6 and @xmath5 , respectively . for the `` giant '' planets with @xmath131 , we adopt @xmath132 and mass from the mass - radius relationship @xmath133 of @xcite , which is consistent with earth to saturn in the solar system ( other proposed mass - radius relationships , such as those of @xcite and @xcite , would give a similar plot ) .",
    "for the `` rocky '' planets with @xmath134 , we adopt @xmath135 and mass from the mass - radius relationship @xmath136 of @xcite .",
    "the dashed and solid lines in figure [ fig : taue ] show @xmath94 as a function of @xmath3 according to equations ( [ eq : pratiopowerlaw ] ) and ( [ eq : dj ] ) for @xmath137gyr and @xmath138gyr , respectively , if we have two @xmath139 planets orbiting a solar - mass star ( i.e. , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) .",
    "these lines indicate where such a resonant pair would be in @xmath3 , if it started near exact commensurability , its age is @xmath137gyr or @xmath138gyr , and the tidal eccentricity damping timescale of the inner planet is @xmath94 .",
    "there are some filled symbols below the solid lines for the age of the universe , hinting that some of the near - resonance pairs with @xmath4 can potentially reach their current locations by tidal eccentricity damping in less than the age of the host star .",
    "most of the pairs with @xmath5 ( open symbols ) are well above the lines , indicating that they are unlikely to reach their current locations by tidal eccentricity damping .",
    "however , the comparison in figure [ fig : taue ] is not exact , as the theoretical curves are for a specific combination of stellar and planetary masses , and the observed kepler pairs are plotted for assumed @xmath11 .    turning the inference around",
    ", we may assume that the current architecture was established by tides , and thereby infer constraints on @xmath11 .",
    "we can plot ( equations ( [ eq : taue ] ) and ( [ eq : pratiopowerlaw ] ) ) @xmath142^{-3 } d_j t \\label{eq : qk2max}\\ ] ] versus @xmath3 near the @xmath14:@xmath15 resonance with @xmath143gyr .",
    "this is the _ maximum _ @xmath11 or minimum tidal dissipation efficiency that the inner planet must have if the pair is to evolve to its current @xmath3 in less than the age of the universe .",
    "the actual @xmath11 is smaller by the ratio of the age of the planetary system to the age of the universe . in figure",
    "[ fig : qk2max ] , the points show this maximum @xmath11 for the inner planet of the observed kepler pairs .",
    "the four panels show the @xmath6 and @xmath5 cases for 3:2 and 2:1 .",
    "the lines with arrows pointing upward are the known lowest bound on @xmath11 for planets ( @xmath127 for giant planets and @xmath126 for rocky planets ; see  [ sec : qk2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : qk2max ] clearly shows that some pairs with @xmath4 can reach where they are by tidal eccentricity damping , if planets with @xmath134 are rocky with @xmath144 .",
    "they include koi  500.03/04 , koi  500.04/01 , koi  730.02/01 , koi  961.01/03 , and koi  2038.01/02 just outside 3:2 , and koi  720.04/01 , koi  904.01/04 , koi  952.04/01 , koi  1161.03/01 , and koi  1824.02/01 just outside 2:1 , which are @xmath145@xmath146 of all pairs with @xmath4 in the period ratio ranges shown in figure [ fig : qk2max ] .",
    "however , none of the pairs with @xmath5 can reach their current @xmath3 , if planets with @xmath131 are giants with @xmath147 .",
    "furthermore , there are clumps of @xmath5 pairs just outside 2:1 and 3:2 that are more than an order of magnitude below @xmath148 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : qk2max ] we only plot the adjacent pairs , as the tidal evolution of the non - adjacent pairs can be significantly affected by secular or even resonant interactions with the intervening planet(s ) .",
    "adjacent pairs with @xmath5 could evolve significantly faster , if the outer planet has @xmath149 and much lower @xmath11 to overcome the steep dependence of the tidal eccentricity damping rate on orbital semimajor axis ( equation ( [ eq : taue ] ) ) .",
    "however , for the observed kepler pairs with @xmath5 in the upper panels of figure [ fig : qk2max ] , only three with @xmath3 between @xmath150 and @xmath151 and two with @xmath3 between @xmath21 and @xmath152 have an outer planet with @xmath149 .",
    "so our conclusion that most of the pairs with @xmath5 can not reach their current @xmath3 by tidal eccentricity damping , if planets with @xmath131 are giants with @xmath153 , is robust .    in the above analysis",
    ", we follow the kepler team in using @xmath154 as the boundary between super - earths and neptunes .",
    "some pairs are moved from the upper panels of figure [ fig : qk2max ] to the lower panels if we increase this boundary to @xmath155 ( and vice versa if we decrease this boundary to @xmath156 ) , but the overall patterns ( i.e. , some pairs in the lower panels have maximum @xmath11 of the inner planet above @xmath126 and all pairs in the upper panels have maximum @xmath11 of the inner planet below @xmath127 ) remain the same .",
    "we have shown that some of the kepler near - resonance pairs with @xmath6 may be able to move to their current near - resonance locations by tidal damping of eccentricity if they are rocky with @xmath157 , but that all known pairs with @xmath5 are unable to move to their current near - resonance locations by the same mechanism if they are giants with @xmath158 .    what are the alternatives ?",
    "one possibility is that some of the @xmath131 planets are in fact rocky with low @xmath11 .",
    "we have checked that increasing the boundary between super - earths and neptunes to , say , @xmath159 does not change our conclusions .",
    "this possibility can also be checked by measuring or constraining the masses @xmath69 , and hence the mean densities @xmath160 , of the planets using transit timing variations ( ttv ) or radial velocity data . @xcite",
    "have determined @xmath69 and @xmath160 for @xmath2 pairs of kepler planets from ttv ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "nine of these pairs are in the period ratio ranges plotted in figure [ fig : qk2max ] , all with @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ fig : qk2max3 ] shows the maximum @xmath11 of the inner planet for these nine pairs according to equation ( [ eq : qk2max ] ) , with the open circles using assumed mass - radius relationships ( same as in the upper panels of figure [ fig : qk2max ] ) and the filled squares using the actual masses determined from ttv . the maximum @xmath11 values shift when actual masses are used , but they remain more than an order of magnitude below the lowest bound @xmath161 for giant planets , and mostly above the lowest bound @xmath162 for rocky planets . although the inner planets of two pairs ( koi  1336.01/02 and koi  168.03/01 ) have @xmath163 that clearly exceed the bulk densities of uncompressed rocks , the inner planets of three pairs ( koi  841.01/02 , koi  244.02/01 , and koi  248.01/02 ) have @xmath164@xmath165 , which are more consistent with giant planets . although @xcite have suggested that the low densities of some planets with @xmath166 ( such as koi  244.02 and koi  248.01 ) could be due to an extended envelope of hydrogen and helium @xmath167 in mass on a rocky planet , koi  841.01 ( which has @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) is most likely a giant planet .",
    "another relevant case is the koi  142 system , which has one transiting planetary candidate ( koi  142.01 ) that shows large ttv as well as detectable transit duration variations ( tdv ) . @xcite",
    "have determined from the ttv and tdv that koi  142.01 has @xmath170 and @xmath171 and that it is just wide of the 2:1 resonance ( @xmath172 ) with an outer planet with @xmath173 .",
    "since there is also an estimated stellar age ( @xmath174gyr ) , we can determine from equation ( [ eq : qk2max ] ) the actual ( instead of maximum ) @xmath11 needed for koi  142.01 : 3400 , which is lower than the lowest bound for giant planets by a factor of @xmath175 .",
    "however , this constraint on @xmath11 of koi  142.01 is unlikely to be valid , because the relatively large orbital eccentricities of both planets ( mean @xmath176 and @xmath177 ) are not consistent with the tidal eccentricity damping scenario @xcite .",
    "so another mechanism is needed for some of the pairs with @xmath178 . @xcite",
    "have considered the possibility of _ in situ _ formation of planets near first - order mean - motion resonances in a simple dynamical model without orbital migration or dissipation . for the effective viscosity and dimensionless scale height , @xmath71 , typically assumed for protoplanetary disks ,",
    "most of the kepler candidates are sufficiently small that they are unable to open gaps in their natal protoplanetary disks and should undergo type i migration .",
    "@xcite has suggested migration in a turbulent disk , which has both smooth and stochastic components , as a way to produce near - resonance pairs .",
    "the departure from exact commensurability can be used to constrain the relative strength of smooth and stochastic migration .",
    "however , @xcite has assumed that the smooth migration is always inward , which is only true for classic type i ( and type ii ) migration .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have shown that planet - disk interactions for partial gap - opening planets may provide sufficient energy dissipation and eccentricity damping and lead to near - resonance pairs .",
    "however , effective viscosity and/or dimensionless scale height smaller than typical values is required for most of the kepler candidates to open partial gaps .",
    "finally , we note that recent analysis of the corotation and horseshoe torques ( plus the differential lindblad torque ) have shown that the coefficient @xmath179 for the migration rate in equation ( [ eq : dadt ] ) is a function of the local surface density gradient @xmath180 , temperature gradient @xmath181 , viscous saturation parameter @xmath182 , and thermal saturation parameter @xmath183 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in certain disk models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is possible for type i migration to be outward in the viscously heated regions of the disk and in the region inside the magnetospheric truncation radius , if the corotation and horseshoe torques are not saturated @xcite .",
    "there are also locations in the disk where the total torque vanishes and the migration is stalled .",
    "this more complex migration behavior means that it is possible for a pair of planets to undergo both convergent and divergent migration , as the disk accretion rate decreases with time and the disk depletes . whether the breaking of resonances by divergent migration could result in an excess of planet pairs just outside",
    "the first - order resonances will require further investigation . in this paper ,",
    "however , we have shown that the later evolution due to tides is not enough to explain the structures near resonances .",

    "<S> , we find a constraint on the ratio of the planet s tidal dissipation function and love number that implies that some of the kepler planets are likely solid . </S>",
    "<S> however , tides are not strong enough to move many of the planet pairs to the observed separations , suggesting that additional dissipative processes are at play . </S>"
