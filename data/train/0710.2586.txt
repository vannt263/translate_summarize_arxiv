    "entanglement is a unique feature of quantum systems that play a key role in quantum information processing .",
    "the early study of entanglement is only focused on the foundations of the quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "recently due to its potential applications in quantum communications , quantum cryptography , quantum computer and quantum information @xcite , entanglement has been studied extensively .",
    "one of the most important progress is the quantitative measures of entanglement for mixed state by using the entanglement of formation @xcite . for the special case of two spin-1/2 systems , the entanglement of formation",
    "is given by the concurrence @xcite .",
    "newly , considerable interest has been devoted to entanglement of quantum spin system @xcite , identical particles @xcite , fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , and spins of a noninteracting electron gas @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , since anderson published his famous paper @xcite about disorder induced localization , extensive investigations have focused on the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) . for one - dimensional ( 1d ) anderson model , it is well known @xcite that all eigenstates are localized and there is no mobility edge separating localized and extended states .",
    "however , the specific extended states and/or mobility edges have been found in several 1d determined and random model with short - range and long - range correlation @xcite .",
    "the well - studied examples of the potentials are a slowly varying potential @xcite , random - dimer potential @xcite , long - range correlated disordered potential @xcite and anderson model with long - range hopping @xcite . in these models ,",
    "electronic localized behaviors are studied by judging thouless exponent ( or lyapunov coefficient ) , participation ratio or dynamics of wave function .",
    "recently mode entanglement of spinless electrons sharing in one - particle states in 1d model has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . using the ordinary harper and",
    "the kicked harper model , lakshminarayan and subrahmanyam found that entanglement can reflect mit .",
    "similar behavior is also found for the ground state of an electron in 1d frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) potential @xcite .",
    "there are many more complex 1d potentials , e.g. , potentials used in refs.@xcite , which have been widely used to study the mit and exhibit more complex localization behaviors than that of the harper model .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the mode entanglement of an electron in these more complex 1d potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "the formalism of entanglement and concurrence is described . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the numerical results for four kinds of models are presented .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in the second - quantized picture , the hamiltonian for electrons moving in 1d determined and/or random potential can be written as follow : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a nearest - neighbor hopping integral , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the creation(annihilation ) operator of _",

    "is given @xcite as @xmath19 states that have a large minimum pairwise concurrence can be said share entanglement better .",
    "specifically , when @xmath20 , the state becomes the so - called @xmath21 state @xcite and the concurrence is given by @xmath22 .",
    "there can not be states whose minimum pairwise concurrence exceeds @xmath22 . as a gross but useful measure of entanglement sharing , lakshminarayan and subrahmanyam propose and study the pairwise concurrence averagely in a given state .",
    "for the given eigenstate , @xmath23 where @xmath24 . from the definition of ( 6 ) , we can see that @xmath25 has connections to measures of localization of the eigenstates . as a further gross measure they also average over all the eigenstates @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of all the states . in the following concurrence @xmath28 and @xmath29",
