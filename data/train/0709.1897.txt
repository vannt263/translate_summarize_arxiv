    "during the past two decades , optimization techniques have been extensively applied to design external control fields to manipulate the evolution of quantum mechanical systems   @xcite .",
    "a typical application is to force the states to approach the priori prescribed targets as closely as possible , including both bounded  @xcite and unbounded  @xcite situations .",
    "also , optimization theory can be applied to improve the efficiency of desired quantum state transitions , e.g. , the evolution time @xcite and the energy consumed by the controls  @xcite are most interesting .",
    "for some low dimensional quantum systems that evolve on compact lie groups , one can find analytical solutions for such optimization problems with bounded  @xcite or unbounded  @xcite controls .",
    "however , in the higher dimensional situations , numerical algorithms have to be applied .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the optimal steering problem for the class of quantum systems whose evolution operators can be described by the @xmath0 matrices .",
    "the underlying system is modelled by an evolution equation of the form  @xcite:@xmath2x(t),~x(0)=i_2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is a two dimensional special pseudo - unitary matrix ; @xmath4 is real function of time @xmath1 , which is the control input of the system ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are arbitrary matrices that can be expressed as the linear combination of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are the generators of the lie algebra @xmath10 and can be identified as follows:@xmath11    in @xcite , jurdjevic has taken the initial steps in the problems of optimal control for the special case when @xmath12 and @xmath13  ( the corresponding properties of the optimal controls also can be found for the systems evolving on the homomorphic groups @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "unlike the case of @xmath16  @xcite , however , as will be seen in section  [ sec2 ] , system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) usually ca nt be transformed into the special form such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , it is natural for us to consider the general case in detail .    with specific realizations and representations of the lie algebra",
    "@xmath10 introduced , system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) can be used to describe various of quantum dynamical processes , e.g. , the superfluid system under bose realization  @xcite , the harmonic oscillator under @xmath17-realization  @xcite , the @xmath0 coherent states under irreducible unitary representation with respect to positive discrete series  @xcite .",
    "the optimal control problem to be considered in this paper is formulated as follows .",
    "given an arbitrary target evolution matrix @xmath18 in @xmath0 , we wish to find a control function @xmath4 that can steer the evolution matrix associated with system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) from its initial state @xmath19 to some desired final state @xmath18 , and meanwhile , minimize the quadratic cost function@xmath20    where @xmath21 is the final time . the quadratic cost index given in ( [ eq1.2 ] ) measures the energy consumed during the steering process between the initial @xmath19 and the terminal @xmath18 .",
    "since the remarkable difference between the quantum systems and the classical systems is that the evolutions of the former may be disturbed by the decoherence phenomenon .",
    "this is practical because that the increasing of the intensity of the electromagnetic fields , which are used to control the evolution of the coupled quantum system , tend to induce relaxation and decoherence phenomena .",
    "based on the maximum principle for systems evolving on lie group  @xcite , explicit forms of the control functions with respect to both normal and abnormal extremals will be derived analytically .",
    "the problem considered here can be viewed as the noncompact prolongation of the @xmath16 case presented in  @xcite . however , according to quantum theory and group representation theory  @xcite , the noncompact @xmath0 lie group has only infinite dimensional unitary representations , and hance the associated evolution operator ( or propagator ) corresponding to @xmath3 is always infinite dimensional , which describes the transition between two quantum states defined in an infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath0 coherent states is a typical example  @xcite .",
    "this makes the derivation quite different from and far more complicated than that in the case of @xmath16 .",
    "the balance of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , some useful results including controllability properties and the maximum principle with respect to the quantum system evolving on lie group @xmath0 are introduced . in section  [ sec3 ] , we discuss the optimal steering problem with respect to the abnormal extremals . properties of the abnormal optimal control function are characterized . in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "the control functions corresponding to the normal extremals are derived analytically for all possible cases . in section  [ sec5 ] ,",
    "two examples are provided for illustration .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "with the three generators @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the lie algebra @xmath10 in ( [ eq1.1a ] ) , any given evolution matrix @xmath22 associated with system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) can be written as@xmath23      with the inner product @xmath27 defined by@xmath28    where @xmath29 is the hermitian conjugation of @xmath30 , it can be verified that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 form an orthonormal basis of the lie algebra @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , the drift term @xmath5 and the control term @xmath6 in system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) can be expressed by linear combinations of the three generators @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 as follows:@xmath31    in this paper , we say @xmath32 is pseudo - orthogonal to @xmath30 when @xmath33 . and @xmath32 will be called elliptic ( hyperbolic , parabolic ) if @xmath34 is negative ( positive , zero ) . accordingly , the matrices in the lie algebra @xmath10 are separated into three different types . since for any matrix @xmath35 , we have@xmath36    i.e. , none of the changes of coordinates by the @xmath0 transformations will alter the type of an @xmath10 matrix .",
    "thus , as mentioned in section  [ sec1 ] , system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) usually ca nt be transformed into the special case such that @xmath12  ( hyperbolic ) and @xmath13  ( elliptic ) .",
    "we assume system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is controllable in this paper , this ensures that the optimal control problem stated in the introduction section is always solvable .",
    "system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is said to be controllable on @xmath0 if for any given target evolution matrix @xmath37 there always exists at least one control @xmath4 such that @xmath38 for some time @xmath21 .",
    "the problems of the controllability for systems evolving on lie groups have received a great deal of attention in the past decades ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as for the systems evolving on the noncompact lie group @xmath0 , a sufficient and necessary condition is provided in  @xcite and can be summarized as follows .",
    "[ theorem2.1](@xcite )    1 .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are linearly dependent , then system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is uncontrollable on @xmath0 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are linearly independent , then system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is controllable if and only if the set @xmath39 is nonempty .    to obtain the optimal control functions",
    ", we will make use of the well - known maximum principle on lie groups  @xcite , which , under the assumption that system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is controllable , can be summarized for the @xmath0 case as follows  @xcite .",
    "[ theorem2.2]assume that system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is controllable , if @xmath40 is an optimal control that minimizes the quadratic index given in ( [ eq1.2 ] ) and @xmath41 is the corresponding optimal trajectory of ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "then , there exists a constant matrix @xmath42 and a nonnegative real number @xmath43 , not both zero , such that for almost everywhere ( a.e . ) the hamiltonian function@xmath44{x^o}(t)\\right>+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_ou(t)^2\\ ] ]    is minimized with respect to @xmath45 by @xmath40 .",
    "the above theory immediately provides a necessary condition for the optimality .",
