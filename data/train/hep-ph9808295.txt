    "baryon and lepton number are not strictly conserved in the standard model of electroweak interactions @xcite ( see @xcite , @xcite for recent reviews ) . in the attempts to evaluate the rate of baryon number violating transitions @xcite , the finite energy barrier between inequivalent vacua of the electroweak lagrangian plays a crucial role .",
    "this energy barrier is characterized by a static classical solution of the equations of motion  : the sphaleron @xcite .",
    "the sphaleron was first constructed for vanishing weinberg angle , @xmath0 , where the equations of motion simplify by means of a spherically symmetric ansatz @xcite .",
    "later , the sphaleron solution was constructed for finite weinberg angle @xcite . there",
    "the expectation @xcite that the sphaleron energy for the physical mixing angle @xmath1 is very close to the case @xmath0 was confirmed .    in the meantime ,",
    "it was shown @xcite that the sphaleron constructed by klinkhamer and manton ( km ) does not represent the top of the minimal energy barrier when the higgs mass parameter exceeds a critical value .",
    "indeed , for @xmath2 the configuration realizing the minimal energy barrier is given by another static solution of the equations , the bisphaleron .",
    "the name refers to the fact , that the bisphaleron solutions appear as a pair , transformed into each other by parity .",
    "their classical energy is lower than the one of the km sphaleron .",
    "although interesting from the point of view of non - linear differential equations admitting bifurcations , the bisphaleron does not appear to be physically relevant in the ( minimal ) one higgs standard model ( 1hsm ) , because the bisphaleron exists only for a value of the higgs boson mass much higher that the actual upper bound @xcite for the higgs boson mass  : @xmath3 .",
    "however , several extensions of the minimal electroweak model are considered as alternative candidates for the description of the electroweak interactions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . among these extensions",
    "the ones incorporating a second higgs doublet in the model ( 2hsm ) play a central role , such as the minimal supersymmetric extension , which is considered for many theoretical reasons .",
    "the upper bound on the higgs boson mass @xmath4 is not valid in general in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . here",
    "upper bounds for the lighter neutral cp - even higgs bosons are found to be in the range @xmath5 ",
    "@xmath6 @xcite , depending on the model under consideration . however , these bounds are not valid for the heavier neutral cp - even higgs boson .",
    "it is therefore natural to wonder whether the sphaleron - bisphaleron bifurcation persists in the presence of a second higgs doublet @xcite and to investigate whether the bisphaleron exists for more physically realistic values of the parameters .",
    "this problem is addressed in detail in this paper for a family of higgs potentials depending on four parameters and leading to a higgs mechanism for each of the two doublets .",
    "sphaleron , ( winding ) bisphaleron and ( deformed ) bisphaleron solutions were first constructed in @xcite",
    ". a detailed numerical analysis of the sphaleron - bisphaleron bifurcation strongly suggests that , for a large domain of the parameters of the higgs potential , the bisphalerons determine the energy barrier of the model .    in sect .  2 , we present the model , the notations and the physical parameters .",
    "the spherically symmetric ansatz , the equations and boundary conditions are given in sect .  3 ; the numerical solutions are then discussed in sect",
    "we consider the electroweak lagrangian with two higgs doublets , @xmath7 , in the limit @xmath8 ( i.  e. @xmath9 ) .",
    "using the standard conventions for the covariant derivative and gauge field strength , the lagrangian reads @xmath10 with @xmath11 @xmath12 the most general potential constructed with two higgs doublets is presented in @xcite and depends on nine constants . along with ref .",
    "@xcite we consider in this paper the family of potentials of the form @xmath13 depending on four parameters .",
    "the terms directly coupling the two higgs doublets are thus ignored but the main point is that the above potential imposes a higgs mechanism for each of the higgs doublets .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) is invariant under su(2 ) gauge transformations and it possesses a large global symmetry under su(2 ) @xmath14 su(2 ) @xmath14 su(2 ) , which is revealed when using the standard trick @xmath15 and replacing the higgs doublets in ( [ lag ] ) in terms of the corresponding matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the new form of the lagrangian is then manifestly invariant under the transformations @xmath18 with @xmath19 su(2 ) ; this is known as custodial symmetry .",
    "then , the double higgs mechanism imposed by the potential ( [ pot ] ) leads to a mass @xmath20 for the three gauge vector bosons and to masses @xmath21 , @xmath22 for the surviving degrees of freedom of the higgs fields . in terms of the parameters of the lagrangian",
    ", these masses are given by @xmath23 for later convenience we also define @xmath24 note , that the classical solutions of the model are characterized by only three independent parameters , which we choose to be @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "we consider only @xmath28 , @xmath29 so that @xmath30 .",
    "in order to construct classical solutions of the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) , we employ a spherically symmetric ansatz for the fields . with the notations of @xcite",
    ", it reads @xmath31 \\left(\\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right ) \\",
    ", \\nonumber\\\\ \\phi_{(2 ) } & = & { v_1\\over{\\sqrt{2 } } }   \\left[\\tilde h(r ) + i ( \\hat r\\cdot\\vec{\\tau})\\tilde k(r)\\right ] \\left(\\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the custodial symmetry is used to align the two higgs field parallel to each other asymptotically .",
    "this spherically symmetric ansatz leaves a residual gauge symmetry which can be exploited to eliminate one of the seven radial functions @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the radial gauge @xmath32 , which implies @xmath33 .",
    "this leads to the following expressions for the classical energy @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left .   \\cos^4\\beta",
    "\\left[\\epsilon_1 x^2 \\left ( h^2+k^2 - 1\\right)^2       + \\epsilon_2 x^2 \\left ( \\tilde h^2 + \\tilde k^2-\\tan^2\\beta\\right)^2\\right ]       \\right\\rbrace,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dimensionless variable @xmath37 has been used and the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "the equations of motion can then be obtained by varying the functional ( [ efunc ] ) with respect to the six radial functions .",
    "note , that in the case @xmath39 the equations for @xmath40 decouple and these functions can be set consistently to zero , the remaining system then corresponds to the one of the 1hsm .",
    "regularity of the solutions at the origin imposes the condition @xmath41 at @xmath42 , the custodial symmetry ( [ custo ] ) can then be exploited to fix the following values of the radial fields at the origin @xmath43 the condition of finiteness of the classical energy imposes the following asymptotic form on the functions @xmath44 for some real number @xmath45 , and @xmath46 equal to zero or one .",
    "in order to make the following discussion self - contained , we first summarize the main features of the solutions in the 1hsm , i.  e.  the case @xmath47 with @xmath48 .      the km sphaleron exists for all values of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "for this solution @xmath49 , and the classical energy increases monotonically as a function of @xmath26 @xmath50 the km sphaleron is always unstable , but the number of its directions of instability increases with increasing @xmath26 , when new solutions , bisphalerons , bifurcate from the sphaleron @xcite .",
    "these bisphalerons have lower energy than the sphaleron . at @xmath51",
    "the first bisphaleron bifurcates from the sphaleron , @xmath52      solutions of the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) were first constructed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for another choice of the higgs potential ) .",
    "confirming the results of @xcite , our analysis indicates that a solution of the km type , i.e.  with @xmath53 exists for all values of the parameters of the potential . in these solutions the asymptotic angle ( [ condin ] )",
    "is always @xmath54 , irrespectively of the parameters of the potential .    in fig .  1 we have plotted the energy of the km sphaleron for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( i.  e.  when no bisphaleron is present ) as a function of the angle @xmath57 .",
    "the height of the barrier does not vary considerably with @xmath57 ; changing the values of @xmath58 leads to a very similar picture .    for sufficiently high values of @xmath26 ( or of @xmath27 )",
    "bisphalerons start to exist .    in @xcite",
    "it was found that in the special case @xmath59 deformed bisphalerons bifurcate from the sphaleron at the same critical values of the higgs masses , @xmath60 as in the 1hsm .",
    "indeed , for @xmath59 these solutions can be obtained form the sphaleron and bisphaleron solutions of the 1hsm by scaling the higgs field functions @xmath61 by the factor @xmath62 @xcite . however , there are additional solutions in the 2hsm bifurcating from the sphaleron at values of the higgs mass as small as @xmath63 for @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "these solutions do not possess counterparts in the 1hsm and , like the deformed bisphalerons , they are unstable and appear as a pair @xcite .",
    "one characteristic of these bisphaleron solutions in the 2hsm is that the angle @xmath64 increases monotonically from @xmath65 ( for @xmath42 ) to @xmath66 ( for @xmath67 ) , while @xmath68 decreases from @xmath65 to @xmath69 .",
    "the difference of the angles @xmath70 , increases from @xmath65 to @xmath71 , corresponding to the relative phase between the two higgs bosons , which can be characterized by the degree of a map @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "these solutions are referred to as winding solutions @xmath73 in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we prefer to use the name winding bisphalerons .",
    "the energy of the winding bisphaleron with @xmath74 is lower than the energy of the sphaleron or the deformed bisphalerons @xcite .",
    "thus , if for given parameters of the model the winding bisphaleron with @xmath74 exists , it represents the barrier between topologically distinct vacua .    in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the lowest energy bisphaleron solutions , the winding bisphalerons with @xmath74 , which hereafter also will be called bisphalerons for short , when no confusion with the deformed bisphalerons can arise .",
    "for the winding bisphaleron solutions , the six radial functions are non vanishing and fulfill the boundary conditions ( [ condas ] ) . the asymptotic angle @xmath45 depends of the parameters but remains close to @xmath75 ( e.  g.  @xmath76 for @xmath77 ) .",
    "we analyzed in detail the sphaleron - bisphaleron transition in the 2hsm .",
    "for fixed values of @xmath27 , we determined the critical value @xmath78 of the bifurcation as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .  2 for @xmath79 and several values for @xmath27 .",
    "before we turn to the discussion of the bifurcations in general let us discuss first the case @xmath59 , which was considered in @xcite . at the sphaleron - bisphaleron transition the functions @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 vanish . using the reparameterization @xmath83",
    ", we find in this case that the angle @xmath57 does no longer appear in the differential equations for the functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these equations become identical for @xmath59 . assuming that the solutions of these equations are unique ( up to sign )",
    ", we find the relation @xmath86 , which is consistent with the boundary conditions ( [ condas ] ) . with this relation",
    "we find that in the differential equation for the function @xmath87 the terms involving the angle @xmath57 cancel .",
    "thus , the angle @xmath57 disappears completely from the differential equations .",
    "consequently , the critical value @xmath78 is a constant in this case , @xmath88 .",
    "the constant @xmath89 will play a crucial role in the following discussion of the bifurcations in the general case . in fig",
    ".  2 we exhibit the critical value @xmath78 as a function of @xmath57 for fixed values of @xmath27 .",
    "the solid curves correspond to @xmath90 and the dashed curves correspond to @xmath91 . for @xmath92",
    "the critical value @xmath78 consists of two intersecting curves ( dashed - dotted ) .",
    "while the first one is a constant given by @xmath93 , the second one is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath57 , which possesses the value @xmath94 at @xmath95 and vanishes at @xmath96 .",
    "the curves intersect at at @xmath97 . from fig .",
    "2 we see , that the curves with @xmath98 can not be deformed continuously into the curves with @xmath99 .",
    "turning to the question for which ranges of parameters bisphalerons exist , we first consider @xmath90 . in this case",
    "bisphalerons exist for parameters @xmath100 ( lower solid curves ) and for @xmath101 ( upper solid curves ) . for @xmath26 below the lower solid curves ,",
    "bisphalerons only exist for restricted ranges of the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath57 , i.  e. @xmath102 , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 denotes the value of @xmath57 for which the critical value @xmath105 becomes zero for a fixed value of @xmath27 .",
    "we find @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for @xmath26 above the upper solid curves , in contrast ,",
    "the solutions exist for all @xmath57 and even for vanishing @xmath27 .",
    "in general we observe from fig .  2 , that with increasing @xmath27 the bisphalerons exist in an increasing region of the parameter space .",
    "note , that for @xmath90 the critical value @xmath78 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath57 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case @xmath108 , which we will discuss next .",
    "for @xmath109 the bisphalerons exist outside the regions enclosed by the upper and lower dashed curves in fig .  2 . ,",
    "i.  e. they exist below and to the right of the upper dashed curves , and above and to the left of the lower dashed curves .",
    "the regions enclosed by the upper dashed curves shrink in size with increasing @xmath27 , degenerate to a single point ( @xmath95 , @xmath110 ) at @xmath111 and cease to exist for @xmath112 .",
    "similarly , the regions enclosed by the lower dashed curves shrink in size with increasing @xmath27 . as @xmath27 approaches the value @xmath113 these regions degenerate to the vertical line ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) . for @xmath116",
    "the bisphalerons exist for all values of @xmath57 and @xmath26 .",
    "again we find , that for increasing @xmath27 bisphalerons exist in an increasing region of the parameter space .    from the discussion above , we find for the case @xmath92 that bisphalerons exist for @xmath117 $ ] and for @xmath118",
    "$ ] , where @xmath78 is given by the dashed - dotted curves in fig .  2 .",
    "to present this complicated situation in a more transparent way , we exhibit in fig .  3 a three dimensional plot of the parameter space , where the bisphalerons exist outside the shaded region .",
    "the surface of this region is formed by the set of bifurcation points .",
    "the curves of fig .  2 correspond to the intersections of horizontal slices with the surface of the shaded region .",
    "note , that there is a discrete symmetry in fig .  3 , given by the transformation @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "indeed , this symmetry is also a symmetry of the differential equations . for any solution @xmath121 for the parameters @xmath122 there is a solution for parameters @xmath123 given by @xmath124 .",
    "both solutions possess the same energy and obey the same boundary conditions eq .",
    "( [ condas ] ) with the same values of the constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the bifurcation of the winding bisphaleron in the 2hsm differs considerably from the bifurcations of the bisphalerons in the 1hsm , where the solutions depend only on one parameter and only one bifurcation point exist for the lowest energy bisphaleron . in the 2hsm",
    "the number of bifurcation points for fixed values of @xmath27 and @xmath57 can be zero , one or two .    for fixed @xmath125 and @xmath126",
    "there is only one bifurcation point .",
    "a second bifurcation point appears if @xmath127 . in this case",
    "we observe from fig .  2 , that for @xmath90 and small values of @xmath57 the two bifurcation points lie on the upper and lower solid curve , respectively . with increasing @xmath57 both bifurcation points decrease",
    "at the critical value @xmath104 the bifurcation point on the lower solid curve vanishes and only one bifurcation point remains . for fixed @xmath91",
    "the bifurcation points lie on the upper and lower dashed curves in fig .  2 .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath90 however , both bifurcation points lie either on the upper dashed curve or on the lower dashed curve .",
    "if @xmath57 is small , the two bifurcation points belong both to the upper dashed curve . with increasing @xmath57 the lower bifurcation point increases , whereas the upper bifurcation point decreases .",
    "at a critical value of @xmath57 the bifurcation points merge into a single point and do not exist for larger values of @xmath57 .",
    "as @xmath57 reaches a second critical value , another bifurcation point appears , which now belongs to the lower dashed curve .",
    "this bifurcation point splits into a pair of points as @xmath57 becomes larger .",
    "the upper bifurcation point of this pair increases with increasing @xmath57 and exist up to @xmath114",
    ". the lower bifurcation point decreases with increasing @xmath57 and vanishes at @xmath128 .    for @xmath129",
    "there is no bifurcation point for @xmath130 and only one bifurcation point for @xmath131 , which lies on the lower dashed curves in fig .  2 .    for @xmath132 no bifurcations of the winding bisphalerons with winding number @xmath74",
    "were found for @xmath126 .",
    "we demonstrate these bifurcations for fixed @xmath133 and for @xmath134 and @xmath135 in fig .  4 , where the energies of the sphaleron and the bisphaleron are shown as functions of the parameter @xmath26 . for small values of @xmath26 the bisphaleron ( solid and dashed lines ) and the sphaleron ( dotted lines ) both exist",
    "the energy of the bisphaleron is smaller than the energy of the sphaleron .",
    "however , the difference of the energies is very small .",
    "when @xmath26 reaches the critical value @xmath78 , the energy curve of the bisphaleron merges into the energy curve of the sphaleron . for larger values of @xmath26 , bisphalerons do not exist until @xmath26 reaches the second critical value . at this point",
    "the energy curve of the bisphaleron bifurcates from the energy curve of the sphaleron . for larger values of @xmath26",
    "both sphaleron and bisphaleron exist and the energy of the bisphaleron is again less than the energy of the sphaleron .",
    "the curves for @xmath134 and @xmath135 look very similar .",
    "however , there is a complicated transition as @xmath57 varies between the values @xmath134 and @xmath135 , not shown in fig .  4 .",
    "as @xmath57 becomes gradually larger the bifurcation points on the energy curve approach each other and merge into one single point at some critical value of @xmath57 . at this value of @xmath57",
    "the bifurcation point is a tangential point of the two energy curves . with increasing @xmath57 the energy curves separate first and approach each other again , when @xmath57 approaches a second critical value . at this value of @xmath57",
    "a tangential point is formed again , which splits into a pair of bifurcation points with increasing @xmath57 .",
    "in addition to the sphaleron - bisphaleron transitions the 2hsm also possesses transitions of sphalerons and bisphalerons to the sphalerons and bisphalerons of the 1hsm .",
    "these transitions correspond to the limits @xmath136 ( and @xmath137 ) .",
    "we will consider two different cases for the limit @xmath136 . in the first case we consider @xmath136 with fixed mass @xmath22 . in the second case we consider @xmath136 with @xmath138 but with fixed @xmath139 , such that the contribution to the energy of the ( @xmath140 ) dependent part of the higgs potential is ( at most ) finite . in both cases",
    "we assume that the functions @xmath141 and @xmath142 vanish @xmath143 and reparameterize @xmath141 and @xmath142 as @xmath144 , @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "the purpose of this parameterization is that we can take the limit @xmath146 in a well defined way .    for the discussion of the limit @xmath136 in the first case , we substitute @xmath147 into the differential equations and keep @xmath27 fixed .",
    "then the differential equations for the functions @xmath148 do not contain any explicit @xmath57 dependence .",
    "in addition the boundary conditions at infinity for the functions @xmath148 are independent of @xmath57 . in the limit",
    "@xmath136 the differential equations for the functions @xmath149 are independent of @xmath148 and reduce to the equations of the 1hsm with higgs mass parameter @xmath26 . in the equations for the functions",
    "@xmath148 the gauge field functions @xmath150 are still present .",
    "thus , the latter system of differential equations has to be solved for fixed functions @xmath150 , the solutions of this differential equations depend on the parameter @xmath27 and indirectly also on @xmath26 .",
    "let us now discuss the limit @xmath136 for the bisphaleron solutions of the 2hsm , i.  e.  for parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 outside the shaded region in fig .  3 at @xmath95 .",
    "in the case @xmath151 the functions @xmath149 approach the corresponding functions of the bisphaleron of the 1hsm , as @xmath136 . in the case @xmath152 however , the bisphaleron of the 1hsm does not exist and the bisphalerons of the 2hsm reach the sphaleron of the 1hsm .",
    "consequently , the functions @xmath82 and @xmath80 vanish in this limit . for the decoupled equations for @xmath148 we found in both cases , that they possess nontrivial solutions for all values of @xmath27 considered as above . in particular , for @xmath152",
    "the function @xmath153 is nontrivial , as long as the value of @xmath27 lies above the shaded region in fig .  3 at @xmath95 , and @xmath153 vanishes as @xmath27 approaches the shaded region .",
    "in the limit @xmath136 the functions @xmath148 do not contribute to the energy .",
    "thus , in this limit the energy of the bisphalerons of the 2hsm is given by the energy of the bisphalerons of the 1hsm with higgs mass parameter @xmath26 if @xmath154 , and by the energy of the sphaleron of the 1hsm if @xmath155 .",
    "for the discussion of the limit @xmath136 in the second case , we again substitute @xmath147 . in this case",
    "we fix @xmath156 as a consequence the @xmath57 dependence does not disappear from the differential equations .",
    "however , this case is analog to the case discussed before in the limit @xmath157 . taking both limits , @xmath146 and @xmath157 , simultaneously",
    ", we find again that the energy and the functions @xmath158 of the 2hsm approach the corresponding energy and functions of the bisphaleron of the 1hsm for @xmath154 , whereas for @xmath155 they approach the corresponding energy and functions of the sphaleron of the 1hms . in this limit the functions @xmath85 and @xmath153 remain nontrivial for @xmath154 as well as for @xmath155 .",
    "note , that for @xmath157 the potential for the higgs field functions @xmath159 becomes a constraint , @xmath160 , which can be fulfilled if we parameterize @xmath161 , @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is a function to be determined by the residual differential equation , which still depends on the gauge field functions @xmath87 and @xmath82 .",
    "once the constraint @xmath160 is fulfilled , the contribution of @xmath159 to the potential vanishes , which leads to a vanishing contribution to the energy in the limit @xmath146 .    for the discussion of the limit",
