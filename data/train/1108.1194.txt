    "self - gravity may be important in the cool outer regions of both protostellar and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) accretion discs , where the combined effects of pressure and shear can not stabilize the flow against gravitational instability .",
    "the local linear stability of self - gravitating discs is simple @xcite : it depends upon the parameter , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the sound speed and surface density of a low - mass disc ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 is the epicyclic frequency which , in a keplerian disc , is the same as the angular velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the non - linear behaviour , however , is complex .",
    "a self - gravitating disc can either fragment into bound objects , or attain a  stable \" self - gravitating state in which angular momentum transport results in accretion and energy dissipation . determining what sets",
    "the boundary between these outcomes is important for understanding angular momentum transport @xcite and planet formation in protoplanetary disks @xcite , and star formation in discs around agn @xcite .",
    "since gravity is a long - range force angular momentum transport via self - gravity could in principle be a non - local process @xcite .",
    "global numerical simulations @xcite , however , show that disc self - gravity can be approximated surprisingly well using a model in which turbulent heating associated with angular momentum transport is _ locally _ balanced by radiative losses .",
    "the use of this local approximation @xcite greatly simplifies the description of the disc . in a local description",
    ", thermal equilibrium implies that the stress , measured via the equivalent shakura - sunyaev @xmath0 parameter @xcite , is inversely proportional to the time scale on which the disc can radiate its thermal energy @xcite .",
    "the stability of the disc against fragmentation also depends upon its cooling time @xcite .",
    "writing @xmath10 , two - dimensional local numerical simulations show that fragmentation of a self - luminous disc ( one in which the only source of heat is furnished by accretion ) ensues whenever @xmath11 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* assuming a 2d adiabatic index @xmath12 ) .",
    "this minimum cooling time before fragmentation is equivalent to a maximum @xmath13 that a stable self - gravitating disc can sustain @xcite .",
    "consistent results for the location of the fragmentation boundary are obtained from two - dimensional global simulations , provided that care is taken to avoid prompt fragmentation during the initial growth of instability @xcite . in three - dimensional global simulations the situation is less clear .",
    "there is evidence that such discs are somewhat less stable against fragmentation than their two - dimensional counterparts @xcite , although a critical cooling time does nonetheless appear to exist @xcite .",
    "we also note that strong temperature dependence of the opacity can modify the fragmentation boundary substantially @xcite .",
    "this work deals exclusively with simpler temperature - independent disc cooling .    applying these results for self - luminous discs to protostellar and agn discs",
    ", fragmentation is predicted to occur for @xmath14 in protostellar discs @xcite , and at @xmath15 for agn @xcite . at these large radii ,",
    "however , the temperature of a self - luminous disc is small enough  about 10  k  that the thermal balance of a real disc in a star forming region or galactic nucleus may often be influenced by external irradiation ( or , in the agn case , by internal heating due to embedded stars ) . here",
    ", we use numerical simulations to revisit the stability of self - gravitating discs , taking into account that irradiation as well as dissipation of accretion energy may contribute to the thermal balance . our goal is to determine whether , in an irradiated disc , the fragmentation boundary is determined by a minimum cooling time or by a maximum @xmath0 . these quantities , which are no longer equivalent in a disc subject to irradiation , are both physically important : @xmath16 measures the time scale on which overdense clumps can radiate thermal energy and collapse further , while @xmath0 is related to the amplitude and non - linearity of density perturbations .",
    "we also address the question of whether an annulus of the disc , initially assumed to be stabilized against self - gravity by irradiation , is able to viscously respond to an increase in surface density without entering the fragmentation regime .",
    "this work expands on earlier work by @xcite in which irradiation from an envelope around a protoplanetary disc was shown to weaken the gravitational instability , and is complementary to the analytic discussion in @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the local ( shearing - sheet ) simulations that we perform to investigate the evolution of irradiated self - gravitating discs , in section  3 we discuss the results of these simulations , and in section  4 we discuss some implications of our results .",
    "to investigate the evolution of self - gravitating discs in the presence of external irradiation we use the pencil code , a finite difference code that uses sixth - order centered spatial derivatives and a third - order runge - kutta time - stepping scheme ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "as in @xcite , we use a  shearing sheet \" , or  local \" , model in which the disc dynamics is studied in a local cartesian coordinate frame corotating with the angular velocity , @xmath9 , of the disc at some radius from the central star . in this coordinate frame , the unperturbed differential rotation of the disc manifests itself as a parallel azimuthal flow with a constant velocity shear in the radial direction .",
    "we assume keplerian rotation and hence use a shear parameter of @xmath17 ( such that the @xmath18-component of the fluid velocity is @xmath19 ) . the unperturbed background surface density , @xmath20 , and two - dimensional pressure , @xmath21 , are assumed to be spatially constant .",
    "a coriolis force is included to take into account the effects of the coordinate frame rotation .    to use the  local \" model we need to assume that the disc is cool and hence thin ( @xmath22 ) and , as in @xcite",
    ", we also assume that it is razor - thin .",
    "the continuity equation and equations of motion in this model are @xmath23 where @xmath24 is velocity relative to the background parallel shear flow @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the two - dimensional pressure , @xmath6 is the surface density , @xmath27 is the gravitational potential of the gas sheet , and @xmath28 is a viscosity term that includes both a kinematic viscosity and a bulk viscosity for resolving shocks . since this disc is razor - thin , poisson s equation becomes @xmath29 this can be solved by fourier transfoming ( using the standard fast fourier transform ( fft ) technique ) the surface density from the ( @xmath30 , @xmath18 ) plane to the ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) plane giving @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the fourier transforms of the gravitational potential and surface density , and @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that in the shearing sheet approximation , the radial wavenumber , @xmath31 , is no longer constant , but varies with time as @xmath37 .",
    "for a two - dimensional domain of size @xmath38 with resolution @xmath39 , the only fourier harmonics that will be present at time @xmath40 will have wavenumbers @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 $ ] , and integer numbers @xmath44 and @xmath45 lie in the range @xmath46 . as in @xcite we only use wavenumbers that satisfy @xmath47 which is the largest circular region in fourier space that is always available , and ensures that the gravitational force is isotropic on small scales .",
    "the equation of state is essentially the standard @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the two - dimensional internal energy per unit volume , and @xmath50 is the two - dimensional adiabatic index .",
    "we use @xmath51 which can be mapped to a three - dimensional adiabatic index of between @xmath52 and @xmath53 depending on whether the disc is strongly self - gravitating or not ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for protostellar discs ,",
    "a smaller value of @xmath50 may be more appropriate .",
    "however , since the work here is not restricted only to protostellar discs , we have chosen to use @xmath51 .",
    "rather than solving for internal energy , the pencil code actually solves for the specific entropy , @xmath54 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we use a cooling function similar to that used by @xcite but modified by the inclusion of a heating term that represents external irradiation .",
    "when written in terms of specific entropy , the combined heating and cooling function that is imposed is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the temperature corresponding to a sound speed of @xmath5 and @xmath57 is constant cooling time , generally written as @xmath58 with @xmath16 a predefined constant .",
    "the sound speed , @xmath59 , is an effective minimum sound speed set by the background irradiation and which we generally express in terms of an effective @xmath60 where @xmath61    all the simulations presented here consider a rectangular box of size @xmath62 with a resolution of @xmath39 where @xmath63 , the same as the  standard \" run in @xcite .",
    "the sound speed , or pressure , and surface density are initially constant and are set such that @xmath64 . the initial perturbations are introduced through the velocity field which is perturbated from the background flow by a gaussian noise component with a subsonic amplitude .",
    "each simulation has a prescribed cooling time , @xmath16 , and an imposed level of external irradiation , @xmath60 .",
    "we consider initially simulations with no external irradiation ( @xmath65 ) and vary the cooling time ( as measured by @xmath16 ) to establish the fragmentation boundary and to investigate the quasi - steady nature of those simulations that do nt fragment .",
    "a quasi - steady state is one in which @xmath66 settles to an approximately constant value , generally between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and remains at this value for many cooling times .",
    "in such a state , the instability is active but the system does not fragment and the instability acts to transport angular momentum .",
    "the disc is regarded as having fragmented if very dense clumps form , with densities more than 2 orders of magnitude greater than the average density , and survive for many cooling times .",
    "the presence of a bound clump also rapidly heats up the surrounding gas and so the @xmath66 value in a simulation that fragments also does not settle to an approximately constant value , but continues to rise .",
    "[ fig : quasi - steady ] shows the surface density structure from a simulation that has settled into a quasi - steady state . in this case @xmath69 and @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : q_profile ] shows the variation of @xmath66 against time illustrating that after an initial burst phase , @xmath66 settles into a quasi - steady state with @xmath70 that persists for many cooling times . note that the saturated value of @xmath66 is almost a factor 2 larger than what is usually found in 3d simulations ( e.g. cossins et al 2009 ) , where @xmath71",
    "this is due to the stabilising effect of the finite disc thickness in 3d simulations @xcite , which dilutes the effect of gravity by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the wavenumber of the perturbation .",
    "since for the most unstable modes @xmath74 , we expect a reduction in the linear stability threshold for @xmath66 by approximately a factor 2 , as observed .",
    "[ fig : fragment ] shows the surface density structure for a simulation , with @xmath75 and @xmath65 , that has undergone fragmentation .",
    "it can be shown that when a system settles into a quasi - steady state , the shear stress - which we express in terms of an effective @xmath0 - satisfies the relationship @xcite @xmath76 the shear stess can also be determined in each simulation using the reynolds and gravitational stresses .",
    "the average reynolds stress is @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are , again , the velocity perturbations with respect to the background keplerian flow .",
    "as described in detail in @xcite , the average gravitational shear stress can be determined in the fourier domain using @xmath80 where the sum is over all fourier components .",
    "the effective @xmath0 is then @xmath81 which can then be compared with the effective @xmath0 determined using the imposed cooling time .",
    "we consider a series of simulations with @xmath16 varying from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "we find that fragmentation occurs for @xmath84 .",
    "@xcite found fragmentation for @xmath85 and the reason for the difference is simply that we have considered a different specific heat ratio , @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "for each simulation that does not fragment we calculate the effective @xmath0 from the reynolds and gravitational stresses using equation ( [ eq : alpha_stress ] ) and compare it with that expected from the imposed cooling time ( e.g. , equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_tcool ] in which the measured @xmath0 values determined using the reynolds and gravitational stresses are plotted as triangles , while that expected from the imposed cooling are plotted as diamonds .",
    "the averaged quantities that are needed to determine the effective @xmath0 values are written out by the pencil code every 100 iterations , corresponding to a time resolution of @xmath86 , depending on the courant condition .",
    "the measured @xmath0 values are then determined by averaging over at least a few cooling times ( generally @xmath87 or greater , except for the simulations with very long cooling times ) starting once the system has settled into a quasi - steady state .",
    "there is a discrepancy between the measured and expected @xmath0 values , with the mean of the measured values being higher than that expected .",
    "the @xmath88 error bars , however , show that the values are at least consistent .",
    "the discrepancy is thought to be due to truncation errors .",
    "we have chosen to minimise the kinematic viscosity and as result some energy is lost at the grid scale @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha_tcool ] does , however , show that the maximum stress that can be attained in a quasi - steady system is @xmath89 , consistent with earlier results @xcite .      in a quasi - steady state in the absence of external irradiation , the imposed cooling is balanced by heating due to the reynolds and gravitational stresses . to consider the influence of external irradiation",
    ", we impose a combined heating and cooling function of the form shown in equation ( [ eq : cooling ] ) . in a quasi - steady state",
    "the following should then hold @xcite @xmath90 using equation ( [ eq : alpha_stress ] ) we can therefore show that , with external irradiation included , @xmath91 if we assume that @xmath92 , we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : alpha_irr ] ) as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the saturated @xmath66 value to which the quasi - steady simulations settle .",
    "since @xmath6 and @xmath5 are probably correlated , the approximation made to go from equation ( [ eq : alpha_irr ] ) to equation ( [ eq : alpha_qirr ] ) may not be accurate , but at least gives us an approximate relationship between @xmath0 , @xmath60 and @xmath94 .",
    "the form of equation ( [ eq : alpha_qirr ] ) is also consistent with , and a generalisation of , the expression used by @xcite to represent viscosity in a self - gravitating disc .    to establish the influence of external irradiation",
    ", we consider various values of @xmath16 and for each value of @xmath16 we consider a number of different values of @xmath60 .",
    "[ fig : alpha_tcool_qirr ] compares the measured @xmath0 values ( determined using the reynolds and gravitational stresses as described above ) with the expected @xmath0 values determined using equation ( [ eq : alpha_irr ] ) , plotted against @xmath60 for @xmath95 ( top left ) , @xmath96 ( top right ) , and @xmath97 ( bottom ) .",
    "again , we only include simulations that settle into a quasi - steady , self - gravitating state .",
    "the diamonds show the mean of the measured values and the error bars are 1 @xmath98 errors .",
    "the triangles show the expected value determined using equation ( [ eq : alpha_irr ] ) . once again , the measured values are higher than those expected but do illustrate , very clearly , that as the level of irradiation increases , the instability weakens - as expected - and the value of @xmath0 decreases . a quasi - steady @xmath0 that exceeds the expected maximum of @xmath99 is also never measured .",
    "[ fig : contour ] summarizes our determination of the fragmentation boundary in the @xmath100 plane .",
    "the plotted contours show lines of constant @xmath0 , determined using equation ( [ eq : alpha_qirr ] ) with , using figure [ fig : q_profile ] as a guide , @xmath101 . ideally we should be using equation ( [ eq : alpha_irr ] ) to set the contours ,",
    "but we do nt really know an appropriate value for @xmath102 or how it might vary with @xmath60 , so equation ( [ eq : alpha_qirr ] ) provides a suitable approximation .",
    "the contour values , from bottom to top at @xmath65 , are @xmath103 and @xmath104 . the symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] show all the simulations that have been performed , with the triangles being those that fragmented and the diamonds being those that settled into a quasi - steady state .",
    "the number next to each diamond is the measured @xmath0 value for that simulation .",
    "[ fig : contour ] illustrates that for every cooling time there is a level of irradiation ( @xmath60 ) for which fragmentation does not occur .",
    "however , the boundary between fragmentation or a quasi - steady , self - gravitating state does not appear to be strictly determined by a maximum value of @xmath0 . if the boundary was determined largely by a maximum expected value of @xmath0 , it should lie along one of the solid contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "the actual boundary is illustrated by the dashed - line in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "as @xmath16 decreases , the value of @xmath60 required to halt fragmentation is larger than would be expected .",
    "the maximum quasi - steady @xmath0 is also , consequently , smaller than expected .",
    "this suggests that the local cooling rate can influence fragmentation , although it appears that for every cooling time there is a @xmath60 that inhibits fragmentation .",
    "we would expect that for sufficiently large @xmath60 ( e.g. , vertical dash - dot line at @xmath105 in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] ) there would be no instability growth as the disc would be maintained above the threshold for linear instability .",
    "also , for @xmath106 , fragmentation occurs for both @xmath107 and @xmath108 , while for @xmath109 a quasi - steady state is achieved for both values of @xmath16 : this suggests that there may be a boundary region ( i.e. , between @xmath109 and @xmath105 ) in which a quasi - steady , self - gravitating state is achieved for all values of @xmath16 .",
    "however , it is also possible that for sufficiently small values of @xmath16 there could be no value of @xmath60 for which a quasi - steady ( i.e. , self - gravitating but non - fragmenting ) state is achieved .",
    "if so , the system would either undergo fragmentation or be linearly stable .",
    "this could have implications for mass loading of systems with very short cooling times .",
    "if there are indeed cooling times for which a quasi - steady state can not exist then it suggests that such systems would be unable to viscously respond to increases in surface density and would typically go from being linearly stable to fragmenting if the surface density increases sufficiently .",
    "the long growth timescales of the instabilty in systems with large values of @xmath60 is , however , very long and so we do nt attempt to determine here precisely what happens for very short cooling times .    ultimately , we have been able to robustly determine the fragmentation properties of discs with @xmath110 , reaching values at the top end that are close to the limit where irradiation entirely quenches gravitational instability . in this range , we find that irradiation modestly suppresses the critical value of @xmath16 below which fragmentation occurs , from a value of @xmath111 in the absence of irradiation down to a value @xmath112 for the most strongly irradiated disc simulated .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath0 that a self - gravitating disc can sustain similarly decreases as the strength of irradiation is increased .",
    "@xcite suggests that there is a relationship between the perturbation amplitude ( @xmath113 ) and the cooling parameter , @xmath16 .",
    "in particular they find that the rms averaged perturbation amplitude , @xmath114 , obeys the following relationship @xmath115 if , as suggested above , the fragmentation boundary is determined primarily by the effective @xmath0 rather than by the imposed cooling , @xmath16 , we might expect that the perturbation amplitude would depend on @xmath0 rather than @xmath16 .",
    "[ fig : sigrms_alpha ] , shows @xmath0 plotted against @xmath116 for all the simulations we performed that did not fragment .",
    "the diamonds are for all the simulations with @xmath65 ( i.e. , fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_tcool ] ) while the other symbols are for the simulations with @xmath117 and correspond to the simulations illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_tcool_qirr ] , although we have also added the @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath75 simulations that are nt included in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_tcool_qirr ] . the values for @xmath118",
    "were determined by averaging over at least 10 slices starting after the quasi - steady state was reached .",
    "the error bars are 1@xmath98 errors .",
    "the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigrms_alpha ] is @xmath119 and is essentially equivalent to equation ( [ perturb_amp ] ) , taken from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : sigrms_alpha ] therefore confirms that the there is a relationship between the perturbation amplitude and the effective @xmath0 , rather than the cooling time . that this holds for both irradiated and non - irradiated discs illustrates that it is universal and is essentially independent of the condition of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the reason we have plotted @xmath0 against @xmath120 , rather than the other way around , is to highlight that the fundamental relationship is that the magnitude of the effective @xmath0 depends only on the magnitude of the density perturbations .",
    "if , as one might expect , fragmentation requires non - linear density perturbations ( @xmath121 ) this then implies that the maximum @xmath0 that can be supplied by a quasi - steady system ( i.e. , one that does not fragment ) is @xmath89 , consistent with earlier results @xcite .",
    "however , as illustrated above , it appears that for short cooling times fragmentation can occur even if the expected @xmath0 is less than @xmath122 which suggests that large , localised perturbations in these systems can grow to form bound clumps even if the perturbation amplitude in the system as a whole is typically small .    to further illustrate the universality between @xmath0 and the perturbation amplitudes , we plot , in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspec ] , the power spectrum of the perturbations for 4 of the simulations . as in @xcite",
    "the x - axis is in units of @xmath123 and since the power spectra all peak at @xmath124 , this illustrates that most of the power comes from wavelengths smaller than @xmath125 ( i.e. , the shear stress come primarily from wavelengths significantly smaller than the model size ) .",
    "[ fig : powerspec ] also shows that the power spectra all have the same basic form with , as expected , the amplitude increasing with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the two simulations with the approximately the same @xmath0 values ( but different values for @xmath16 and @xmath60 ) have almost identical power specta .",
    "this illustrates that the structure of the turbulent state does not depend on the cooling rate or the level of irradiation , but is determined only by the effective value of @xmath0 .",
    "for a self - gravitating accretion disc to fragment , gravitational instability must produce strong density perturbations that can cool quickly enough to collapse before shear and pressure forces disperse them . these requirements for fragmentation can be expressed via two dimensionless numbers : a maximum value of @xmath0 , which fixes the amplitude of density fluctuations , and a minimum value of @xmath16 , which measures the cooling time in terms of the local orbital time scale . in the absence of external heating , local thermal equilibrium implies an exact equivalence between these descriptions , but this is no longer the case once irradiation becomes significant . in this paper , we have used local , two - dimensional simulations of self - gravitating discs to plot the fragmentation boundary in both isolated and irradiated discs .",
    "we find that the fragmentation boundary for irradiated discs does not lie at fixed values of either @xmath0 or @xmath16 .",
    "irradiation necessarily weakens the strength of gravitational instability , but whether it stabilizes or destabilizes discs against fragmentation depends upon the chosen metric . in terms of the cooling time scale , irradiation stabilizes discs : a strongly irradiated disc can avoid fragmentation for cooling times almost a factor of two smaller than the limit for a non - irradiated disc . in terms of the maximum stress , however , irradiation has the opposite effect : the maximum @xmath0 sustainable in an irradiated disc is lower than that reached in the absence of irradiation .",
    "this is somewhat counterintuitive but is likely a consequence of the universal nature of the form of the power spectrum of the perturbations .",
    "although irradiation weakens the instability , it is still possible for large , local perturbations to exist .",
    "if the cooling time is sufficiently short then these large perturbations could collapse to form fragments even if the typical perturbations are small ( i.e. , @xmath126 ) .    for protoplanetary discs , the implication of our results is to reinforce the conclusion that the outer regions of protoplanetary discs are generally unstable to fragmentation at the high accretion rates encountered soon after disc formation @xcite . for a disc forming in a cold environment ( @xmath127 ) , the rate of infall at radii @xmath128 may well exceed the maximum accretion rate ( @xmath129 ) that can be transported inward by the magnetorotational instability , even if the mri is active at these radii despite the effects of ambipolar diffusion @xcite .",
    "if so , continued infall will result in the build up of surface density until self - gravity sets in , at which point our results imply that irradiation will not save the disc from fragmentation .",
    "irradiation will , of course , increase the surface density and temperature of the critically fragmenting disc , making it ( even ) more likely that the outcome of fragmentation will be substellar objects rather than massive planets @xcite .",
    "discs forming in substantially warmer environments ( @xmath130 ) have a better chance of avoiding fragmentation , since the mri in these systems may be able to transport all the infalling gas inward without locally exceeding the threshold surface density for gravitational instability .",
    "if all other aspects of star formation remained fixed , we would therefore expect to see more wide binaries in cool environments , and more young extended gas discs in warmer star forming climes .",
    "finally , we caution that our results strictly apply only to the stability of _ isolated _ self - gravitating discs .",
    "protoplanetary discs approaching the threshold surface density for gravitational instability do so on account of infall , which need not be steady or axisymmetric .",
    "the dynamical effects of infall appear to stabilize discs against fragmentation @xcite , at least to some degree , but further work is needed to ascertain whether it is possible to avert fragmentation indefinitely at radii where isolated local disc models predict collapse .",
