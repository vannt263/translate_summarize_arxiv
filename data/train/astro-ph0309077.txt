    "on march 7th 2002 , the advanced camera for surveys ( acs , ford et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ) was installed in hst during the space shuttle mission st-109 .",
    "acs is an instrument designed and built with the study of the faint galaxy population as one of its main goals .",
    "here we describe the processing and analysis of some of the first science observations taken with the acs wide field camera , called early release observations ( eros ) .    an important result obtained with the wfpc2 observations of the hubble deep fields ( williams et al .",
    "1996 , casertano et al .",
    "2000 ) was the measurement of the galaxy number count distribution to very faint @xmath22 limits .",
    "however , it is remarkable that different groups have reached different conclusions about the slope and normalization of the number counts even when using the same software on the same dataset ( see e.g. ferguson , dickinson & williams 2000 , vanzella et al .",
    "one of the few results on which all groups seemed to agree was the flattening of the number counts at @xmath23 .",
    "however , bfm claim that this is a spurious effect , caused by the underestimation of the true luminosity of faint galaxies by standard aperture measurements , and that the number counts continue with a slope of @xmath24 up to the limits of the hdfn v and i bands .",
    "two of the main goals of this paper are improving our understanding of the biases and selection effects involved in counting and measuring the properties of very faint galaxies , and developing techniques that can be applied to a wide range of observations and that are easily reproduced by other astronomers .",
    "this is essential if galaxy counting is to become a precise science .",
    "we have done this by using almost exclusively public software , and specifying the parameters used , thus ensuring that our results are repeatable .",
    "our final results are the number counts in the @xmath17 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands , carefully corrected for selection effects . using an independent procedure",
    ", we confirm the apparent absence of flattening in the number counts found by bfm .",
    "we also show that using proper priors , reasonably robust photometric redshifts can be obtained using only three acs filters .",
    "finally , we present photometric catalogs of field galaxies in the vv 29 and ngc 4676 fields .    the structure of the paper is the following : section 2 describes our observations , section 3 deals with the image processing and the generation of the catalogs , including the description of the simulations used to correct our number counts .",
    "section 4 lists and explains the quantities included in our catalogs , section 5 presents our number counts , and section 6 summarizes our main results and conclusions .",
    "the observations analyzed here were obtained with the wide field camera of the advanced camera for surveys ( ford et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ) and include two fields .",
    "the first is centered on vv 29 ( vorontsov - velyaminov 1959 ) , also known as ugc 10214 and arp 188 ( arp 1966 ) , a bright spiral with a spectacular tidal tail at @xmath27 . due to a pointing error ,",
    "the field was imaged twice , resulting in a central region with twice the exposure time of the ngc 4676 field .",
    "the galaxy itself and its associated star formation has been considered in detail by tran et al.(2002 ) .",
    "the second field is centered on ngc 4676 ( holmberg , 1937 ) , an interacting galaxy pair at @xmath28 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the acs images of these fields , and table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the observations .",

    "a brief description of the calibration and reduction procedures for the vv 29 field can be found in tran et al .",
    "the raw acs data were processed through the standard calacs pipeline ( hack 1999 ) at stsci .",
    "this included overscan , bias , and dark subtraction , as well as flat - fielding .",
    "calacs also converts the image counts to electrons and populates the header photometric keywords .",
    "about half of the images in these datasets were taken as cosmic ray ( cr ) split pairs that were combined into single `` crj '' images by calacs ; the rest were taken as single exposures .",
    "the calibrated images were then processed through the `` apsis '' acs investigation definition team pipeline , described in detail by blakeslee et al .",
    "briefly , apsis finds all bright compact objects in the input images , sorts through the catalogs to remove the cosmic rays and obvious defects , corrects the object positions using the acs distortion model ( meurer et al .",
    "2003 ) , and then derives the offsets and rotations for each image with respect to a selected reference image . for the present data sets ,",
    "over one hundred objects were typically used in deriving the transformation for each image , and the resulting alignment errors were about 0.04 pix in each direction .",
    "the relative rotation between the first and second epoch vv 29 observations was found to be 012 . the offsets and rotations",
    "were then used in combining the individual frames to produce single geometrically corrected images for each bandpass .",
    "image combination in apsis is done with the drizzle software written by r.  hook ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) .",
    "the data quality arrays enable masking of known hot pixels and bad columns , while cosmic rays and other anomalies are rejected through the iterative drizzle / blot technique described by gonzaga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for these observations",
    ", we used the `` square '' ( linear ) drizzle kernel with an output scale of 005pix@xmath37 .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function ( psf ) was about 0105 , or 2.1 wfc pixels .",
    "the linear drizzling of course correlates the noise in adjacent pixels , decreasing the root - mean - squared ( rms ) noise fluctuations per pixel by a factor @xmath38 for our parameters , where @xmath39 is the linear size of the area in which the fluctuations are measured ( casertano et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , apsis calculates rms arrays for each drizzled image , i.e. , the expected rms noise per pixel in the absence of correlation .",
    "these arrays are used later on for image detection , photometric noise estimation , etc .",
    "figure [ noise ] shows the behavior of the noise as a function of the size of the area in which it is measured .",
    "we see that it follows well the predicted behavior , but it is slightly higher on large scales , an effect which was also noted in the hdfs by casertano et al .",
    "2000 , and is probably due to intrinsically correlated fluctuations in the background galaxy density .",
    "in addition apsis detects and performs photometry of stars and galaxies in the images using @xmath8 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and obtains photometric redshifts for galaxies using the software bpz ( bentez 2000 ) , steps which will be described in detail below .",
    "the stellar fwhm of our images , @xmath40 is significantly better than that of wfpc2 observations ( e.g. , @xmath41 for the hdfs ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the acs wfc point spread function ( psf ) will be published elsewhere ( sirianni et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "table 2 shows the @xmath1 limiting magnitudes for the deep central area of vv 29 ( which was imaged twice ) , and for the outer area of the vv 29 , together with the ngc 4676 field .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the positions derived from the information in the acs image header is limited to @xmath42 by the uncertainty in the guide star positions and the alignment of the acs wfc to hubble s fine guidance sensors . as a last step ,",
    "we correct the astrometry of the images using the software wcstools and the guide star catalog ii ( mink et al . 2002 ) .",
    "although there are not many cataloged stars in our images , visual inspection shows that our corrected positions should be accurate to @xmath43 .",

    "@xmath8 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) has become the _ de facto _ standard for automated faint galaxy detection and photometry .",
    "it finds objects using a connected pixel approach , including weight and flag maps if desired , and provides the user with efficient and accurate measurements of the most widely used object properties .",
    "as stated previously , one of our main goals is to understand in detail how the process of galaxy detection and analysis affect the shape of the number counts distribution , and then use this understanding to arrive at results that are as objective as possible . to achieve our goal",
    ", we carefully choose our @xmath8 parameters , and most importantly , characterize the biases and errors by using extensive simulations with the public software @xmath44 ( bouwens universe construction set , see appendix a , and bouwens , broadhurst , and illingworth 2003 for a detailed description ) .",
    "this approach will allow other astronomers to contrast and compare our results with their own in a consistent way . because the output of @xmath8 sensitively depends on its input parameters , we present our parameters in appendix b to ensure that others can repeat our analysis .",
    "one of @xmath8 s more convenient features is the double image mode .",
    "this mode enables object detection and aperture definition in one image , and aperture photometry in a different image . to create our detection image",
    ", we use an inverse variance weighted average of the @xmath17 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 images .",
    "this differs from the procedure followed for the hdfs by other authors , who usually only use the reddest bands , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , we think that inclusion of the @xmath17 image is justified since it is the deepest of the three ; in fact , table 2 shows that the @xmath17 image is almost as deep as the hdfs for point sources .",
    "the psf in the final detection image is basically identical to that of the @xmath25 image , and differs by less than @xmath45 from the stellar width of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 filters .",
    "although there are roughly thirteen parameters which influence the detection process in @xmath8 , the most critical ones are @xmath48 , the minimum number of connected pixels and @xmath49 , the detection threshold above the background .",
    "we performed tests to select these parameters , ensuring that we recovered all obvious galaxies in the field while not producing large numbers of spurious detections .",
    "we chose the rather conservative limits of @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( which provides a nominal @xmath52 ) , because we think that given the limited scientific information to be extracted from the sources close to the detection limit , it is better to avoid adulterating our catalogs with large numbers of false sources .",
    "figure [ se ] shows the results of a @xmath8 run in a portion of the vv 29 field . to estimate the number of isolated spurious detections , we subtracted the mean sky and changed the sign of all pixels in our images and ran @xmath8 on them with the same parameters and configuration as described in appendix b. the number of spurious detections for @xmath53 is very small in all filters , as we can see in figure [ spurious ] , but have nevertheless been corrected for in the final number counts results .",
    "two other very important parameters which govern the deblending process are _",
    "deblend_nthresh _ and _ deblend_mincont_. typical values used by other authors are respectively @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "at least two teams using hdfn data performed part of the detection / deblending process with manual intervention ( casertano et al .",
    "2000 , vanzella et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this approach may be valid for an isolated field , but we think that it should not be applied to a large set of observations such as the ones which will be produced by the acs gto program .",
    "not only does manual intervention require considerable effort , it also introduces subjective biases and possible inconsistencies that make repeatability by other groups difficult , as well as complicating quantification of the errors with simulations .",
    "consequently , we decided to look for values of the deblending parameters able to perform the best possible blind detection while simultaneously keeping an eye on the biases introduced by this approach .",
    "it soon became clear that if we wanted to avoid excessive splitting of spiral galaxies we would lose some of the faint objects close to the very brightest galaxies and stars . because vv  29 is an exceptional field with a bright galaxy and associated tidal tail spanning the field",
    ", we decided to sacrifice the brightest galaxies by using the automatic procedure described below .",
    "the procedure generates masks which enclose the areas around bright objects in which @xmath8 does not work properly ( see figures [ tadmask ] and [ micemask ] ) .",
    "thus , we were able to focus on the correct deblending of galaxies in the field .",
    "we first generated a simulated field with the same filters , depth , and other characteristics as our acs observations .",
    "this was done using @xmath44 , with galaxy templates extracted from the vv 29 field itself , guaranteeing the same kind of fragmentation problems encountered in the real images .",
    "this simulated field is processed in exactly the same way as the real images , and the output @xmath8 catalog is matched and compared with the input catalog .",
    "a surprising result was that about @xmath56 of the input objects with @xmath57 were not present in the output catalog , in the sense that no object was detected within 0.2 arcsec of their positions .",
    "this number changed little for reasonable values of the deblending parameters . at the same time , the proportion of spurious objects ( present in the output catalog but not in the input one , and formed from fragments of brighter galaxies ) depended strongly on the deblending parameters , varying from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . since no choice of parameters was able to totally eliminate both effects at the same time , we decided to try to make them cancel each other out .",
    "we ran an optimization process on the _ deblend_nthresh _ and _ deblend_mincont _ parameters by minimizing the difference between the magnitude distribution of spurious and `` undetected '' objects , @xmath60^{2}$ ] .",
    "this was achieved for values of 16 and 0.025 respectively .    by definition ,",
    "having @xmath61 conserves the shape and normalization of the number counts .",
    "visual inspection of the @xmath8 aperture maps shows that most of the parameters in this set produced very good results ( see figure [ se ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that a significant part of the differences in the hdf number counts among different groups ( see e.g. vanzella 2002 ) may be caused by the deblending procedure . changing _",
    "deblend_mincont _ from 0.025 to 0.01 and _ deblend_nthresh _ from 16 to 32 more than doubles the numbers of spurious objects , increasing the faint number counts by @xmath62 ( figure [ deblend ] ) .",
    "the values chosen by casertano et al .",
    "2002 , 32 and 0.03 produce results on the acs images quite close to the ones obtained with our optimal parameter set .    the parameter set chosen by us ensures that the number and magnitude distribution of galaxies in the input and output catalogs are the same . since the objects used in the simulation are drawn from a real sample of galaxies , we hope that this will also hold for the observations .",
    "now we turn to a delicate question , how to measure the light emitted by these galaxies .",
    "@xmath8 provides a plethora of magnitude measurements . among them",
    "mag_iso _ , the isophotal magnitude which measures the integrated light above a certain threshold , _ mag_auto _ , an aperture magnitude measured within an elliptical aperture adapted to the shape of the object and with a width of k times the isophotal radius and _ mag_aper _ , a set of circular aperture magnitudes .",
    "the most commonly used magnitude for faint galaxy studies is _ mag_auto _ , with purported accuracies of a few percent for objects detected at high signal to noise .",
    "however , bfm recently claimed that this measurement technique can be off by more than a magnitude near the detection limit .",
    "observational biases in faint galaxy detection and photometry hinder comparison of distant galaxy samples with lower redshift ones such as the sdss ( yasuda et al .",
    "2001 , blanton et al . 2003 ) and the 2df ( magdwick et al . 2002 ) . to estimate these biases we again resort to simulations performed with _",
    "bucs_. using the final vv 29 and ngc 4676 images , we `` sprinkle '' galaxies with the same redshift , colors , and magnitude distribution as the objects present in the hdfn onto both fields .",
    "we use hdfn templates instead of vv 29 since the former have much better color and redshift information , and therefore allow us to recreate with better accuracy realistic galaxy fields ; to avoid overcrowding we use a surface density of only @xmath63 of the observed surface density . finally we analyze the simulated images in the same way as the real images . because we are interested in comparing the recovered or `` observed '' magnitudes with the `` true '' ones , we create galaxies with analytical profiles that have a distribution as similar as possible to the hdfn real galaxies .",
    "we repeat this procedure until @xmath64 galaxies have been added to the ngc 4676 and vv 29 fields .",
    "as expected , we confirm that _",
    "mag_auto _ estimates total magnitudes much better than _ mag_iso _ or",
    "_ mag_aper _ for reasonable values of the apertures , but there is still a significant amount of light being left out .",
    "we fit 5-order polynomials to the median filtered @xmath65 vs @xmath66 data .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig_apertures ] .",
    "we see that our corrections do not rise as dramatically with magnitude as those of bfm , perhaps because we are using quite conservative parameters for _ mag_auto _ , an aperture of @xmath67 times the isophotal radius , and a minimal radial aperture of 0.16 arcsec for faint objects .",
    "nevertheless , there is an actual overall dependence on the depth , especially at very faint magnitudes , where the corrections for the shallow vv 29 field and the ngc 4676 field are systematically larger than that of the deep vv 29 .",
    "the dependence of the correction on magnitude is quite similar for all filters , and we do observe a pedestal effect which affects even objects with @xmath68 . in all filters , the correction increases rapidly when approaching the detection limit of the field , so one has to be very careful in drawing conclusions about derived quantities like the luminosity function when using data close to the detection magnitude limit .      accurately measuring the colors of a galaxy",
    "is often a different problem than measuring its total magnitude . in our case , where all filters have very similar psfs , using a single aperture defined by the detection image guarantees that magnitude measurements in all filters will be affected by the same systematic errors which cancel out when subtracting the magnitudes to calculate the colors .",
    "we again tested several of the @xmath8 measurements and concluded that colors based on _",
    "mag_iso _ provide the best estimate of a galaxy s `` true '' colors ( provided , of course , that the object colors _ inside _ the isophotal threshold are similar to those _ outside _ of it ) .",
    "there seem to be two reasons for this ; first , using an isophotal aperture is more efficient , in terms of signal  to  noise , than @xmath69 , which integrates the light distribution over regions where the noise is dominant .",
    "second , although @xmath8 tries to correct its aperture magnitude measurements for the presence of nearby objects , it does not always do so successfully , and there are a significant number of cases where the magnitudes are strongly contaminated by the light from close companions .",
    "isophotal magnitudes are largely free of this problem . the comparisons between _ mag_iso _ and _ mag_auto _ are shown in figure [ bestcol ] . for bright ,",
    "compact objects a small aperture with a diameter of 0.15 arcsec works slightly better than _ mag_iso , _ but its performance is equal or slightly worse for fainter objects , so we decided to use _",
    "mag_iso _ for all objects .    as expected , the advantages of isophotal magnitudes for estimating colors also are evident in the photometric redshifts . on average",
    ", we can estimate reliable photometric redshifts for @xmath70 more objects if we use _",
    "mag_iso _ instead of _ mag_auto _",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ photoz ] ) .",
    "we show color - color plots , together with the tracks corresponding to some of the templates introduced below , in figure [ colorcolor ] .",
    "we previously noted that @xmath8 is not designed to work near very bright objects and in general will produce numerous spurious detections while missing obvious real objects .",
    "we are experimenting with a wavelet - based method to fit the background that may alleviate the need to perform such steps in the future ( white et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "however , at present we must work around this problem in order to avoid significantly biasing our estimation of the number count distribution .",
    "we masked out areas around bright objects by using an automatic procedure .",
    "first we ran @xmath8 and identified only those objects with areas larger than 20,000 pixels , which are the ones that typically cause problems with deblending .",
    "the mask was created by setting all pixels outside these object to one , and all interior pixels to zero . to create a `` buffer zone '' around these objects , we convolved the mask with a 15 pixel boxcar filter . in the case of vv 29",
    "we additionally masked a small area by hand which contained obvious contamination from star clusters belonging to vv 29 itself .",
    "the final areas that remained after applying the masking are shown in figures [ tadmask ] and [ micemask ] .",
    "the objects in the masked areas are included in the catalog , but are flagged to show that they are in a masked area where @xmath8 is likely to produce incomplete results .",
    "one additional problem is that @xmath8 s probability of detecting an object depends not only on its magnitude , but also on its size , surface brightness , and other parameters . to measure the incompleteness as a function of magnitude",
    ", we again used the simulations described in sec .",
    "[ deblending ] .",
    "we confirmed that the masking procedure has adequately excluded all the areas where the galaxy detection is compromised by bright objects .",
    "the resulting detection efficiency is shown in figure [ ratio ] .",
    "the deep , multi - color hdfn observations provided a strong impetus for developing and using photometric techniques to estimate the redshifts of faint galaxies .",
    "the relatively large number of galaxies that now have ground - based redshifts provide a benchmark for testing different photometric redshift methods .",
    "the most widely used hdfn photometric catalog is that of fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1999 , which includes psf matched photometry of the wfpc2 @xmath71 and ground based @xmath72 bands .",
    "photometric redshift techniques can be broadly divided into those which use a library of spectral energy distributions ( sed ) , and the `` empirical '' methods , which try to model the color - redshift manifold in a non - parametric way ( see bentez 2000 , csabai et al .",
    "2003 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the latter require abundant spectroscopic redshifts , and are therefore more appropriate for low redshift samples such as the sloan digital sky survey ( csabai et al .",
    "2003 ) .    for faint galaxy samples like the ones presented here , and in general for acs observations , the only options are sed - based techniques , for which a critical issue is the choice of the template library .",
    "at first sight it may seem most logical to use synthetic galaxy evolution models , like the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) ones ( used in hyper - z , bolzonella , miralles & pell 2000 ) or the fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) ones , since they take into account age effects , dust extinction , etc .",
    "however , simple tests quickly showed that the most effective seds for photometric redshift estimation are obtained from observations of real galaxies , e.g. a subset of the coleman , wu and weedman ( 1980 ) ( cww ) spectra augmented with two kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) starbursts ( bentez 2000 , csabai et al .",
    "2003 , mobasher et al . in preparation ) .",
    "but even these templates have shortcomings .",
    "a detailed comparison of the colors predicted by the cww+sb templates and those of real galaxies in several spectroscopic catalogs show small but significant differences .",
    "we developed a method to trace these differences back to the original templates , and model them using chebyshev polynomials , generating a new set of `` calibrated '' templates which produce much better results in independent samples .",
    "we show these new templates , together with the original extended cww set in figure [ templates ] . a detailed description of this technique will be given elsewhere .",
    "many observers assume that measuring accurate photometric redshifts requires as many as five or more filters .",
    "however , as we show here , useful redshift information can be derived from as few as three filters by using a bayesian approach .",
    "the problem of determining photometric redshifts can be stated as ( bentez 2000 ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are respectively the redshift , colors and magnitude of a galaxy , and @xmath76 corresponds to the templates , or spectral energy distributions ( sed ) used to estimate its colors .",
    "the term @xmath77 is the likelihood , and the differences between bayesian photometric redshifts and maximum - likelihood or @xmath78 ones arise from the presence of the prior @xmath79 and the marginalization over all the template types .",
    "the redshift - type prior is neither more nor less than the expected redshift distribution for galaxies of a given spectral type as a function of magnitude .",
    "it contains what we know about a galaxy s redshift and type just by looking at its magnitude . in most cases",
    "this is very little , of course , but it is obvious that using this information is just translating common sense to a mathematical form : brighter galaxies tend to be at lower redshifts than fainter ones .    there is a persistent prejudice that using a prior will `` bias '' the redshift estimate , making the data unfit for various scientific applications like measurement of the luminosity function , whereas maximum likelihood estimates are free of such problems .",
    "it is easy to show that this is completely unjustified from the point of view of probability theory .",
    "it is clear that using maximum likelihood is similar , in this particular setting , to using a `` flat '' prior , i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "this means that using maximum likelihood ( or equivalently @xmath81 ) is not assumption - free ; on the contrary , it is similar to assuming that the redshift distribution of galaxies is _ flat at all magnitudes_. to obtain such an observed redshift distribution one has to contrive a luminosity function with enormous evolution rates , therefore tending to significantly `` overproduce '' the number of high - z galaxies .",
    "this is clearly shown in our tests below ( see figure [ bpz ] ) .",
    "lcccc @xmath82 , bayesian & 73 & -0.002 & 0.073 & 5 @xmath82 , max.likelihood & 58 & -0.018 & 0.133 & 3 @xmath83 , bayesian & 16 & 0.004 & 0.081 & 3 @xmath83 , max.likelihood & 31 & -0.04 & 0.126 & 11    ideally one would want to use the real redshift distribution @xmath84 of the field as the prior , but this is usually unknown , since it is the quantity we want to measure .",
    "but it is clear that an analytical fit to the redshift histogram from a similar blank field , like the hdfn , is always a much better approximation  in spite of the cosmic variance  than a flat redshift distribution . thus using empirical priors such as the ones introduced in bentez ( 2000 ) ,",
    "does in fact considerably reduce the biases introduced by maximum - likelihood methods .",
    "simple comparisons like the one below using the same dataset and template sets show that , as expected , bayesian probability gives consistently more accurate and reliable results than maximum - likelihood or @xmath85 techniques ( see also bentez 2000 , csabai et al .",
    "2003 , mobasher et al . in preparation ) .    to test how well we can expect to estimate photometric redshifts with our data",
    ", we performed the following test .",
    "we ran bpz with the same set of parameters described in appendix c , but using only the wfpc2 bvi photometry from the fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1999 catalog .",

    "we would like to note that although the prediction of the glazebrook et al .",
    "( 1994 ) model fits the data satisfactorily , any result of this kind is very sensitive to the choice of luminosity function parameters , and that in any case it is very unlikely that the evolution of the galaxy population is will be described by such a simple scheme .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore more sophisticated models of galaxy number counts , we hope that these new data and our effort to remove instrumental biases and other corrections which hinder the measurement of the number count distribution will aid future modeling efforts .",

    "the measurement of the faint galaxy number count distribution is still a somewhat controversial subject , with different groups arriving at widely varying results even on the same dataset .",

    "we also confirm , as proposed by bfm , that kron - like ( @xmath69 ) magnitudes , like the ones generated by @xmath8 , can miss more than half of the light of faint galaxies . this dramatic effect , which strongly changes the shape of simulated number count distributions , depends sensitively not only on the characteristics of the observations , but also on the choice of @xmath8 parameters , and needs to be taken into account to make meaningful comparisons with theoretical models or between the results of different authors .",
    "we present catalogs for the vv 29 and ngc 4676 fields with photometry in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "we show that combining the bayesian software bpz with superb acs data and new templates enables us to estimate reliable photometric redshifts for a significant fraction of galaxies with as few as three filters .    after correcting for selection effects",
    "we find that the faint number counts have slopes of @xmath11 for @xmath144 , @xmath145 for @xmath14 and @xmath146 for @xmath147 , and do not flatten ( except perhaps in the @xmath17 filter ) , up to the depth of our observations .",
    "our results agree well with those that bfm obtained with different datasets and techniques ( @xmath15 for @xmath148 and @xmath149 for @xmath150 ) .",
    "this is encouraging , and shows that it is possible to perform consistent measurements of galaxy number counts if the selection effects are properly taken into account .    while some may argue that any corrections  even well motivated ones such as those we use here  are model dependent , given the magnitude of the selection effects , applying some correction is better than none at all , as the widely varying results on faint galaxy number counts demonstrate .",

    "a robust , model - independent way of generating realistic galaxy fields is to take deep observations already available and then rearrange the objects to generate another field . using this approach ,",
    "we simulate deep acs images with the @xmath44 ( bouwens universe construction set ) software . in the first step , we determine the number of times each object appears in a given image by drawing from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath619 , where @xmath620 is the surface density of the object and @xmath621 is the field area being simulated . in the second step , we distribute the objects across the field assuming a uniform random distribution , i.e. no spatial clustering . in the third step ,",
