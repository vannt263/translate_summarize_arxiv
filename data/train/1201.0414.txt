    "inference under uncertainty is a common problem in the real world .",

    "recent studies @xcite @xcite @xcite showed that the framework of information algebra covers many instances from constraint systems , bayesian networks , dempster - shafer belief functions to relational algebra , logic and etc .    in view of the feasibility of computer processing information",

    "the accordance on s - compactness in information algebras thus follows from the conclusions on continuity , that is , a labeled s - compact information algebra induces its associated domain - free s - compact information algebra and , in turn , a domain - free s - compact information algebra induces its associated labeled s - compact information algebra too .",
