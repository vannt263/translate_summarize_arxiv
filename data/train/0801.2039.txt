    "the hirdes design uses the heritage of the orfeus ( _ orbiting and retrievable far and extreme ultraviolet spectrometer _ ) missions successfully flown on the space shuttle in 1993 and 1996 @xcite .",

    "the long slit spectrograph will provide low resolution ( r@xmath21500 - 2500 ) spectra in the 102 - 320 nm spectral range with a design that emphasizes sensitivity for observing faint objects .        according to preliminary results of phase a study on - going at naoc ( china ) ,",
    "the most promising design for this instrument is to have two channels working in 102 - 161 nm ( fuv ) and 160 - 320 nm ( nuv ) ranges , respectively , as shown in figure  [ fig : lss ] .",
    "each channel has its own entrance slit , the arrangement of which is described in the hirdes instrument section above .",
    "both slits are 1``@xmath175 ''",
    "wide that allows 1 arcsec spatial resolution .    in order to maximize sensitivity both lss channels use holographic gratings to minimize the number of reflecting surfaces in optical path , and to enhance overall spatial resolution along the slit .",
    "both channels use microchannel plates working in photon - counting modes as detectors . a slit - viewer similar to that is used in hirdes , internal calibrator , and detector redundancy are being studied .",
    "the two lss channels can be operated independently . to obtain spectra of full spectral range of the same source",
    "the telescope is required to re - point when switching channel .",
    "besides normal integration mode , special observing modes including high time - resolution mode ( up to 1 second ) and `` windowed mode '' , whereas only photons detected by specific part of the detector surface are recorded , are envisaged .",
    "the highest priorities of the fcu imager is to guarantee high spatial resolution and high uv sensitivity while trying to maximize the wavelength coverage and the size of the field of view .",
    "the science requirements for the the imagers in the focal plane of wso - uv are :    * the possibility to obtain diffraction limited images for @xmath15230 nm ( goal @xmath15200 nm ) . *",

    "* partial overlap between spectral range covered by fuv and nuv and nuv and uvo , for relative calibration purposes .",
    "the instrument design concept resulting from the above requirements is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fcu ] .",
    "three wide band channels ( fuv , nuv and uvo ) are provided , covering a wavelength range from 115 nm to at least 700 nm ( see table  [ tab:2 ] ) .",
    "each channel is specialized in a specific wavelength range and will have also spectroscopic , polarimetric and spectropolarimetric capabilities .",
    "the far - uv channel will cover the 115 - 190 nm range . to reduce losses in the throughput , this channel will not have any optics but the mirror to feed it .",
    "the scale of the telescope will be unchanged yielding a large field of view at expenses of spatial resolution .",
    "the fuv channel filter wheels will accommodate narrow and wide band filters and a disperser which will allow low resolution ( r@xmath2100 ) slitless spectroscopy .",
    "the fuv channel will use a photon counting detector based on a mcp detector with a 2k@xmath12k format .",
    "it will have a csi photocathode directly deposited on the mcp .",
    "the read - out system will be based on a ccd detector .",
    "the near - uv channel will cover the 150 - 280 nm range overlapping the fuv range on the shorter wavelengths and the uvo range on the longer ones . to exploit the diffraction limited optical quality of the telescope in this wavelength range the nuv channel has the highest spatial resolution .",
    "its filter wheels will accommodate wide and narrow band filters and polarizers for imaging and imaging polarimetry .",
    "a grating will allow low resolution ( r@xmath0100 ) slitless imaging spectroscopy .",
    "a spectro - polarimetric observational mode is under investigation .",
    "the nuv detector will differ from the fuv detector only for the photocathode ( @xmath18 ) , optimized for this wavelength range and deposited on the detector window .",
    "finally the uvo channel will extend to visual wavelengths to exploit the wide spectral sensitivity of its ccd detector .",
    "the pixel scale of this channel is a compromise between the need of a large field of view and high spatial resolution .",
    "filters , dispersers and polarizers will allow to have narrow and broad band imaging , low resolution ( r@xmath2100 - 500 ) slitless spectroscopy and imaging polarimetry .",
    "the uvo channel will use a single 4k@xmath14k ccd detector optimized for the uv .",
    "the geometry of the focal plane of the telescope makes it necessary to use a mirror to fold the optical beam coming from the telescope in a direction parallel to the optical bench where the three channels of the fcu will be deployed .",
    "two alternative optical layouts are investigated :    1 .",
    "rotating pick up mirror : in this case the mirror will be flat and  using a mechanism  will rotate feeding one of the three channels at a time",
    "mosaic pick mirror : this layout foresees to use three fixed mirrors which will be oriented to feed all channels at the same time .",
    "the expected system throughputs are compared in figure  [ throughput ] to the ones of the cameras that have flown or will fly on board the hubble space telescope i.e. wfpc2 , acs / wfc , acs / hrc and wfc3/uvis @xcite .",
    "throughput includes the telescope , all of the optical elements of the instruments themselves , the sensitivities of the detectors and filter transmissions , that for the fcu are estimated based on the best information currently available and are subject to change .",
    "the throughput of the uvo channel is much better than that of wfpc2 which , by the way , is the oldest of the hst cameras , and is comparable to that of acs / hrc and wfc3/uvis being better in the uv range .",
    "acs / wfc , being optimized in the visual range , has a much better throughput than the uvo channel .",
    "the discovery efficiency , defined as system throughput times the area of the fov as projected onto the sky , is useful when comparing different instruments in the context of wide - angle surveys .",
    "due to its large field of view the uvo channel of the fcu has a discovery efficiency equal or greater than that of acs / wfc , as shown in figure  [ de ] .",
    "the performance of the fuv channel is even better when compared to hst because , in this case ( by the way acs / sbc is not present in the plot ) , no camera working in this wavelength range has a large field of view .",
