    "in @xcite there was given an algorithm which for a _",

    "the set of algebraic requirements must be relaxed . in this paper",
    "we show that indeed this is the case .",
    "our proofs closely follow the proofs from @xcite with some necessary adjustments .",
    "in particular the crucial concept of the topological cutting game introduced in @xcite is considered in this paper not only in the finite , but also in the infinite case .    the approach presented in @xcite and in the present paper in a certain sense is a reminiscent of the approach applied to deterministic automata in @xcite .",
    "namely , the algebraic structure computed from a given automaton @xmath1 induces a graph with edges reflecting the algebraic properties . in the deterministic case it is possible to decide borel and wadge classes analyzing patterns in the graph of the automaton , in the present paper we are looking for patterns in the algebraic graph .",
    "finally let us mention results which provide information about the set - theoretical complexity of a language accepted by a non - deterministic automaton @xmath1 assuming some additional properties of @xmath1 :    * rabin in @xcite proved , that if @xmath4 and its complement are accepted by a non - deterministic bchi tree automata , then @xmath4 is weakly definable , in particular it is borel .",
    "* recently in @xcite it was shown using decidability results about the cost functions , that for a given non - deterministic bchi tree automaton it is decidable whether the language is weakly definable . * in @xcite the decidability results regarding deterministic automata were lifted to a more general context of game automata .",
