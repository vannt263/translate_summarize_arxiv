    "@xcite discovered gliese 229b during a coronographic search for low ",
    "mass companions to young m  dwarfs . despite continued searches ,",
    "gliese 229b to this date is the only substellar object that is resolvable and cool enough to show planet  like absorption features due to methane .",
    "a good understanding of this object is key to our understanding of brown dwarfs and extra  solar planets in general .",
    "published work on this unique object have been primarily spectroscopic in nature ( e.g. @xcite ) or theoretical ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the only published photometry for this object is that by @xcite , hereafter mnko .",
    "photometry is vital for determining gliese 229b s energy distribution ( and hence luminosity and radius ) , as well as for flux calibrating the observed spectra .    in this paper",
    "we present new jhkl@xmath0 photometry for gliese 229b which is more accurate than the photometry obtained by mnko .",
    "we also re  flux calibrate the published spectra for the object and show that previous flux calibrations are in error .",
    "we obtained jhkl@xmath0 photometry for gliese 229b on 1999 january 14 using the nasa infrared telescope facility on mauna kea in hawaii .",
    "we used the facility infrared camera nsfcam ( @xcite ) together with the coronographic instrument coco ( @xcite ) .",
    "coco is a cold coronographic attachment to nsfcam that utilizes an apodized focal plane mask and a pupil mask that stops the telescope outer diameter down to 80% of the full aperture and also obscures the inner 30% .",
    "the focal plane mask is about 2.5 arcseconds in diameter .",
    "coco has an x / y adjustable pupil stop mask and a pupil imager for alignment .",
    "flux in the wings of a stellar profile are reduced by a factor of 510 when using coco .",
    "we also made use of the new tip  tilt capability of the telescope .",
    "the combination of the good image quality and tracking provided by the telescope with tip  tilt , and good removal of the light from the primary star gliese 229a by coco , made our images much cleaner than those obtained by mnko , with a resulting increase in photometric accuracy .",
    "the observational technique used was to nod the telescope between gliese 229a and a sky position 1 arcminute away .",
    "the individual exposure time on gliese 229b ( and sky ) at each of jhk was 90 seconds , and at l@xmath0 it was 20 seconds .",
    "the total on  target integration time was 6 minutes at j , 7.5 minutes at h , 7.5 minutes at k and 20.7 minutes at l@xmath0 .",
    "two jhk flux standards were also observed ( ukirt faint standards 4 and 12 ) , and one l@xmath0 standard ( hd 40335 ) , with appropriate exposure times . the standards were placed on the same region of the detector as gliese 229b , and were also observed by nodding to sky on alternate frames .",
    "the data were reduced by creating flatfields for every target and filter from the appropriate sky frames .",
    "individual flats had to be created as the mask could flex slightly at different telescope positions and hence change the overall ilumination . at jhk",
    "each target frame was sky  subtracted and flatfielded .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out on each frame and the error taken to be the rms deviation in the set of gliese 229b observations , combined with the scatter in the standard star values .",
    "the combined error is 5% at jhk . at l@xmath0",
    "we obtained two sets of data , separated by a standard star observation .",
    "all the sky  subtracted and flatfielded frames in each set were combined ( using sigma  clipping in iraf ) .",
    "the error was derived from the scatter in the remnant background levels , and is 10% .",
    "our jhk values agree with those of mnko within the errors , but our l@xmath0 value is three times brighter than their quoted value , which has very large errors .",
    "our value agrees well with model predictions ( see  4 ) .",
    "table 1 gives our results , and figure 1 shows our reduced images at j ( a single 90 second sky  subtracted and flatfielded image ) and l@xmath0 ( the combined sky subtracted and flatfielded image for one of our two datasets , a total of 10 minutes on  target integration ) . in table 1",
    "jhkl@xmath0 are given on the ukirt system , which is identical to the irtf system except at h such that @xmath4 \\times ( h - k)_{irtf}\\ ] ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "rrrrccr 14.32 & 14.35 & 14.42 & 12.18 & 1.185 & @xmath55.18 & 2.09 @xmath60.05 & @xmath60.05 & @xmath60.05 & @xmath60.10 & @xmath60.070 & @xmath60.04 & @xmath60.10",
    "we have recalibrated the published spectra for gliese 229b using our new photometry and the profiles of the nsfcam filters .",
    "the filter profiles are for the operating temperature of the camera , and we have included the effect of the mauna kea atmospheric transmission .",
    "we have integrated the spectra over the jhkl@xmath0 filters , and ratioed the flux to that obtained by integrating the observed vega spectrum over the same filters .",
    "vega was adopted to be zero magnitude at all wavelengths , and we scaled the gliese 229b spectra such that the flux ratio through the filters matched our photometry . the atmosphere ",
    "convolved nsfcam filter profiles , and the vega spectrum , are available on request to s.  leggett ( skl@jach.hawaii.edu ) , for calibration of other spectra .",
    "we found that although our jhk values are different by @xmath710% the published spectra in this region had to be multiplied by factors of 0.68 to 0.81 , and although the l@xmath0 magnitude differed by a factor of three , the published spectra in that region only had to be multiplied by a factor of 1.03 .",
    "the error in the original flux calibration of the @xcite spectra arose from their assumption that the target flux at the central wavelength of the filter could be simply scaled by the calibrator flux at that same wavelength .",
    "this is not a valid assumption as the flux distribution across the filter is very different for gliese 229b and any calibrator star . in the case of the @xcite spectra ,",
    "those authors did not attempt to scale by the observed photometry and their error arises from the usual problems of flux calibrating narrow slit spectra combined with the uncertainty in removing the scattered light from gliese 229a .    figure 2 shows the @xcite spectra for gliese 229b .",
    "we show the previously published spectral distribution , as well as our revised distribution .",
    "the nsfcam filter profiles are overlaid to demonstrate the unusual flux weighting of the filters for gliese 229b .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xcite higher resolution 12.5@xmath8 m spectrum , before and after recalibration .",
    "scattered light from gliese 229a was seen in the raw data of both groups , despite their use of narrow slits . however the lack of flux in the strong methane and water ",
    "absorption features shows that any residual light from gliese 229a has been accurately removed .",
    "we have calculated the integrated luminosity using the recalibrated spectra .",
    "the unobserved region between the k  band and l  band was represented by a linear interpolation , which is consistent with the models .",
    "the l  band spectrum ends at 4.15@xmath8 m .",
    "the integrated flux beyond this point was adopted to be 29% of the total integrated luminosity , as implied by a recent model by allard & hauschildt ( private communication ) .",
    "the luminosity in this region is affected by strong ch@xmath9 and h@xmath10o bands at 68@xmath8 m ( unobservable from the ground ) , and this flux contribution is 25% smaller than that calculated by extending a rayleigh  jeans tail from the l spectrum .",
    "the total flux is determined to be 6.39e-15 w / m@xmath11 with a 9% error ( due to the flux calibration errors and an estimated 20% uncertainty in the flux beyond the l  band ) .",
    "this flux gives the luminosity and bolometric correction values listed in table 1 .",
    "mnko use models to estimate a bolometric correction to their total in  band observed luminosity , and derive a total luminosity 3% smaller than ours ( with an estimated 12% error ) .",
    "@xcite have published evolutionary models for giant planets and brown dwarfs .",
    "this work includes the condensation of grains in the equation of state but does not include opacity due to grains , and it is to be expected that these models will be revised shortly .",
    "nevertheless our jhkl@xmath0 colors and absolute magnitudes show good agreement with these models in the color  color diagrams ( burrows et al .",
    ", figures 2026 ) at all bands except the h  band .",
    "the discrepancy at h is large  about 0.4 magnitudes .",
    "however our three times brighter l@xmath0 measurement ( @xmath12 1.2 ) now gives a result consistent with the j and k values , implying that gliese 229b has a mass between 25 m@xmath1 and 35 m@xmath1 and an age between 0.5  gyr and 1.0  gyr .",
    "the luminosity determined above and the burrows et al .",
    "evolutionary tracks ( their figure 11 ) imply that a solution near the younger less  massive end of this range is more probable , and that the effective temperature is then around 900  k. ( mnko also determined a temperature of 900  k through a comparison of their photometry with a dust  free model by @xcite . )    burrows et al .",
    "suggest that the previous disagreement between the calculated and observed h and l@xmath0 magnitudes were due to an incomplete ch@xmath9 opacity database .",
    "however ch@xmath9 is an important opacity source at k and l@xmath0 both of which are now well matched by the models .",
    "discrepancies are seen in the h  band with the hotter m and l  dwarfs also ( see e.g. @xcite ) and these have been blamed on incomplete h@xmath10o opacity tables . presumably the problem is due to incomplete knowledge of an opacity source , and the models , which are making large and rapid advances , will soon be able to match the entire gliese 229b spectrum .",
    "we have obtained new jhkl@xmath0 photometry using the coronographic instrument coco with nsfcam on the irtf .",
    "the data are more accurate than previously published values , and while they agree within 10% at jhk , we have determined an l@xmath0 magnitude three times brighter than that previously published .",
    "we have re  flux  calibrated the published spectra for gliese 229b by integrating the spectra over the nsfcam filter profiles .",
    "we find that corrections of about 30% are required at jhk .",
    "the revised spectra are available in electronic form on request to b.  oppenheimer ( bro@astro.caltech.edu ) and t.  geballe ( tgeballe@gemini.edu ) .",
    "the jkl@xmath0 colors and revised luminosity agree well with the evolutionary models of brown dwarfs by @xcite , implying that gliese 229b is likely to be a 0.5  gyr  old 25 m@xmath1 object with t@xmath2 @xmath3900  k. we have not carried out a spectroscopic analysis as the models and synthetic spectra are currently being upgraded to include the effects of grains in both the equation of state and opacity tables  and grains have a large effect on the energy distribution of such cool objects .",
    "we can look forward to a better understanding of the physics of atmospheres at these cool temperatures , now that there exists a more accurately flux calibrated spectrum for gliese 229b .",
    "we are very grateful to the staff at irtf .",
    "the irtf , the nasa infrared telescope facility , is operated by the university of hawaii under contract to nasa .",
    "we are also grateful to france allard and peter hauschildt for calculating the flux contribution longwards of 4.15@xmath8 m , and to the referee for useful comments .",
