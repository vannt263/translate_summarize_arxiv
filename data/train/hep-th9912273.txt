    "during recent years supersymmetric field theories have been investigated using d - branes on a singular manifold such as orbifolds and a conifold . in this",
    "setup field theories arise as world volume theories of the d - branes .",
    "aspects of field theories in question are encoded in geometric information of the singularity .    on the other hand",
    "there has been another approach of construction of supersymmetric field theories using branes which appear in string theory . in this framework quantities of field theories",
    "are determined by configurations of branes .",
    "this approach has an advantage that aspects of field theories can be visualized .",
    "for some cases relations between the two approaches have been discussed , and investigations on brane configurations are also helpful to the study of geometries around singularities probed by d - branes .",
    "in this paper we study brane realizations of supersymmetric field theories corresponding to d - branes on an orbifold @xmath0 with @xmath1 a nonabelian finite subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "finite subgroups of @xmath2 are classified into ade like series just like the finite subgroups of @xmath8 . for a - type subgroups , which are abelian ,",
    "d - branes on the orbifold were investigated in @xcite and brane configurations corresponding to this case are known as brane box models @xcite . for nonabelian cases ,",
    "gauge groups and field content were investigated in @xcite .",
    "brane configurations for d - type subgroups @xmath9 and @xmath10 were also proposed in @xcite .",
    "the crucial point of the construction of the configuration is the correspondence between quiver diagrams of @xmath1 and brane configurations for @xmath11 . according to the fact that the quiver diagram of @xmath12 ( @xmath10 ) is a @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) quotient of the quiver diagram of @xmath15 , the configuration for d - branes on @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is obtained from the configuration for d - branes on @xmath18 by taking @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) quotient . in order",
    "that the @xmath13 quotient can be defined , brane configuration for @xmath7 must have @xmath13 symmetry . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath13 symmetry was realized by a web of @xmath19 5-branes .",
    "it is interesting to study whether similar approach can be applied to the cases in which @xmath1 are exceptional type subgroups of @xmath2 .",
    "we can see that quiver diagrams of such subgroups can be obtained from that of @xmath20 by certain quotients : for instance , the quiver diagram of an exceptional type subgroup @xmath21 is obtained by a quotient by the tetrahedral group . from the correspondence between quiver diagrams and brane configurations , we expect that a brane configuration for @xmath22 is a quotient of the configuration for @xmath23 by the tetrahedral group .",
    "it is however difficult to realize such a quotient on the brane configuration for @xmath23 since it has essentially two - dimensional structure and it is not clear how the group acts on it .",
    "the situation is similar to the case of the brane configuration for @xmath5 . in that case",
    ", we constructed a brane configuration for @xmath7 with a @xmath13 symmetry in order that we can define a @xmath13 quotient . in the present case",
    ", it would be natural that the brane configuration for @xmath23 on which the tetrahedral group acts has three - dimensional structure and manifest symmetry under the tetrahedral group .    in this paper , as a step to the construction of brane configurations corresponding to the e - type subgroups , we propose brane configuraions for @xmath16 and @xmath17 with three - dimensional structure .",
    "the point of the construction is to lift the quiver diagram of @xmath24 , which has essentially two - dimensional structure , into three - dimensions .",
    "the configuration corresponding to this quiver diagram consists of three kinds of ns5-branes intersecting each other and d4-branes whose three directions are bounded by ns5-branes .",
    "naively , the configuration seems to be inappropriate since the number of supersymmetries of the configuration is half of the number the field theory should have : the configuration have two supercharges while field theories of d - branes on an orbifold @xmath11 with @xmath25 have four supercharges .",
    "we argue , however , that the supersymmetry of the field theory on d - branes is enhanced and the number of supersymmetries is the same as that of d - branes on @xmath11 with @xmath25 . by taking quotients on the configuration , brane configurations for @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be constructed .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present three - dimensional realization of the quiver diagrams of @xmath26 and @xmath10 . in section 3 , we first review relations between quiver diagrams and brane configurations . based on the relations , we construct brane configuration corresponding to d1-branes on orbifolds @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we also argue the enhancement of supersymmetries of the field theory on d - branes . in section 4 ,",
    "we comment on a possibility of constructing configurations for @xmath11 with @xmath1 an e - type subgroup of @xmath2 based on the configuration for @xmath23 constructed in section 3 .",
    "in this section , we draw quiver diagrams of finite subgroups of @xmath2 in three - dimensional form .",
    "a quiver diagram of a finite group @xmath1 , which consists of nodes and arrows , represents algebraic structure of irreducible representations of @xmath1 , @xmath27 here @xmath28 denotes irreducible representations of @xmath1 and @xmath29 is a faithful three - dimensional representation of @xmath1 .",

    "there is however a subtlety on the number of supersymmetries .",
    "the configuration consists of four kinds of branes , each of which breaks 1/2 supersymmetries .",

    "as stated above , the configuration of figure [ fig : brane9 - 3a ] is related to figure [ fig : brane9 - 3b ] t - duality , the field theory realized by the configuration has the enough number of supersymmetries .",
    "note that the configuration of figure [ fig : brane9 - 3a ] is more natural than that of figure [ fig : brane9 - 3b ] in the sense that the three coordinates of @xmath191 ( three chiral multiplets @xmath192 ) are treated equivalently .",
    "this is the key point of the construction of the configuration for @xmath5 . due to the symmetric assignment of the multiplets",
    ", however , enhancement of supersymmetry becomes rather nontrivial .",
    "the brane configuration for the orbifold @xmath5 is obtained from that for @xmath7 by a @xmath13 quotient .",
    "the @xmath13 acts as a @xmath193 rotation along the line @xmath194 .",
    "the brane configuration is given in figure [ fig : brane27 - 3 ] .",
    "the reason that the configuration gives the structure of the irreducible representations of @xmath12 is the same as in @xcite .",
    "the gauge group coming from each box depend on whether the box include fixed points of the @xmath13 action .",
    "when @xmath59 is not an integer , only the boxes with index ( 0,0 ) include fixed line of the @xmath13 action .",
    "when @xmath59 is an integer , the boxes with indices @xmath61 and @xmath62 also include fixed lines in addition to ( 0,0 ) . for such boxes , we must take a @xmath13 quotient , which leads the gauge group to be @xmath195 since the gauge field on the box takes the following form , @xmath196 it implies that such boxes correspond to a sum of three one - dimensional representations of @xmath12 . on the other hand , for the boxs which do not include the fixed lines of the @xmath13 action , three d - branes simply pile up and give the gauge group @xmath197 .",
    "it implies that such boxes correspond to three - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath12 .",
    "one can see that the quotienting procedure precicely reproduces the structure of the irreducible representations of @xmath12 .",
    "we can also verify that matter contents obtained after the @xmath13 quotient coincide with those specified by the quiver diagram of @xmath12 .",
    "the brane configuration for the orbifold @xmath6 is obtained from that for @xmath5 by a @xmath64 quotient .",
    "the @xmath64 acts as a reflection with respect to the plane @xmath198 as indicated in the quiver diagram of @xmath10 in figure [ fig : quiver96](b ) . combining with the @xmath13 identification for the configuration corresponding to @xmath5 , it is equivalent to the reflections with respect to the planes @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "the brane configuration is given in figure [ fig : brane54 - 3 ] .",
    "one can verify that the configuration reproduces the structure of the quiver diagrams of @xmath10 .",
    "for details on the structure of the irreducible representations , see @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed brane cube configurations corresponding to d1-branes on nonabelian orbifolds @xmath0 with @xmath25 . this is based on the three - dimensional version of the quiver diagrams of @xmath1 .",
    "the configuration consists of three kinds of ns5-branes and d4-branes .",
    "since the d4-branes are bounded by ns5-branes along three directions , the low energy theory becomes two - dimensional . due to the fact that the configuration is uniform along a diagonal direction , supersymmetry of the field theory",
    "is enhanced twice as many as naively expected .    the original motivation to consider configurations with three - dimensional structure comes from the study of configurations for an orbifold @xmath11 with @xmath1 an e - type subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , the quiver diagram of @xmath21 is a quotient of the quiver diagram of @xmath20 by the tetrahedral group . according to the correspondence between quiver diagrams and brane configurations for @xmath11",
    ", we expect that a brane configuration for @xmath22 is obtained from the configuration for @xmath23 given in figure [ fig : brane27 - 3 ] by taking a quotient by the tetrahedral group .",
    "in fact , the configuration in figure [ fig : brane27 - 3 ] has structure of the tetrahedral group : the configuration consists of cubes , which are in a sence dual to tetrahedra , so we can define an action of the tetrahedral group on the configuration . it is now under investigation whether such a quotient actually reproduces required properties of the gauge theories .",
    "finally we would like to compare the configurations in this paper with those given in @xcite .",
    "the configuration given in @xcite consists of a web of @xmath19 5-branes and d3-branes . as the d3-branes are bounded along two - directions by @xmath19 5-branes , they provide two - dimensional field theory , which coincides with the brane cube configurations .",
    "thus it seems that we should start with _",
    "d1_-branes on @xmath201 to realize @xmath13 symmetry of brane configurations . from this viewpoint , the fact that the brane box model gives four - dimensional theory is owing to the speciality of the abelian case in which an explicit @xmath13 symmetry is not necessary .",
    "as we have discussed , the configurations given in @xcite have esentially two - dimensional structure , while the brane cube configurations are three - dimensional .",
    "it is interesting to see whether there is a relation like duality between the two types of configurations .",
    "if such a relation can be found , it may be possible to construct brane configurations corresponding to @xmath11 with @xmath1 an e - type subgroup based on the brane configurations made out of a web of @xmath19 5-branes .    in @xcite",
    ", it was also argued that the brane configurations are dual to toric diagrams of @xmath11 and that three - dimensional mckay correspondence @xcite-@xcite may be understood as t - duality .",
    "we hope that the three - dimensional version of the quiver diagrams and the brane cube configurations provide some hints on investigations along these lines ."
