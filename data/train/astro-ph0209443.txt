    "the idea that the universe may have more than three spatial dimensions first appeared in the works of kaluza and klein over 70 years ago .",
    "the notion of extra dimensions gradually became popular because of the hope that one might succeed in relating the gauge symmetries of particle physics to the isometries of a compact higher dimensional manifold @xcite .",
    "all such models , however , assumed that the compactification scale is small ( @xmath5 cm ) hence unobservable .",
    "more recently , the many variants of superstring theory allow for the possibility that at least some of the extra dimensions of nature may be macroscopic .",
    "for example , the eleven -dimensional supergravity model of horava and witten @xcite assumes that ordinary matter fields are confined to a submanifold ( brane ) which is embedded in a higher dimensional space ( bulk ) . in an important recent development ,",
    "randall and sundrum ( rs ) examined a simplified variant of this model consisting of a three dimensional brane embedded in a four dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) bulk @xcite .",
    "their results showed that gravitational excitations are confined close to the brane giving rise to the familiar @xmath6 law of gravity , and suggesting that one could identify the brane as our observable universe .",
    "subsequently the rs ansatz was generalised to incorporate both expanding frw - type models @xcite and anisotropic space - times @xcite .",
    "of particular importance to the present study is the observation that simple extensions of the rs scenario can give rise to a universe which is _ accelerating _ , in agreement with studies of high redshift supernovae @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that high redshift type ia supernovae appear fainter than expected in a spatially flat matter dominated ( einstein - de sitter ) universe @xcite .",
    "one way of explaining this discrepancy is to postulate that the universe is filled with a smooth component carrying large negative pressure ( dark energy ) .",
    "although several possible candidates for dark energy have been suggested ( the cosmological constant , quintessence etc . )",
    "none is entirely problem free ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .    in this paper",
    "we shall focus on a new form of dark energy based on the braneworld model examined in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "braneworld models of dark energy have interesting new properties including the fact that , depending upon the form of bulk - brane embedding , the effective equation of state of dark energy can be @xmath7 or @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , for an appropriate parameter choice , the acceleration of the universe can be a transient phenomenon , thus helping reconcile high-@xmath8 supernova observations of an accelerating universe with the requirements of string / m - theory .",
    "the equations of motion governing the braneworld can be derived from the action @xcite [ action ] s = m^3 + _ brane ( m^2 r_4 - 2 ) + _ brane l ( h _ , ) . here , @xmath9 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath10 in the five - dimensional bulk , and @xmath11 is the scalar curvature of the induced metric @xmath12 on the brane .",

    "integrations in ( [ action ] ) are performed with respect to the natural volume elements on the bulk and brane .",
    "the presence of the brane curvature term @xmath20 in ( [ action ] ) introduces an important length scale into the problem @xmath21 . on short",
    "length scales @xmath22 ( early times ) one recovers general relativity , whereas on large length scales @xmath23 ( late times ) brane - specific effects begin to play an important role , leading to the acceleration of the universe at late times @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the braneworld is described by the hubble parameter    [ eq : hubble ] h^2 + a^2 = + 3 m^2 + . the two signs in ( [ eq : hubble ] )",
    "correspond to the two separate ways in which the brane can be embedded in the higher dimensional bulk",
    ". the underlined term in ( [ eq : hubble ] ) makes braneworld models different from standard frw cosmology .",
    "the limiting case of our model @xmath24 corresponds to the well known frw generalisation of the rs scenario @xcite [ eq : cosmolim ] h^2 + a^2 = _b 6 + c a^4 + ( + ) ^2 9 m^6 . in this case",
    ", braneworld evolution departs from the standard frw law at early times when @xmath25 .",
    "however , as remarked earlier , braneworld models described by ( [ eq : hubble ] ) depart from frw behaviour at _ late times _ , a property that opens radically new possibilities for the present and future state of our universe .",

    "this feature makes braneworld models testable and allows the braneworld scenario to provide a new explanation for the observational discovery of dark energy .",
    "the braneworld models described above provide a common platform for understanding the properties of dark energy .",
    "for instance the expression for the hubble parameter in these models ( [ eq : hubble1 ] ) & ( [ eq : hubble2 ] ) allows us to explicitly determine key cosmological quantities including :    * the luminosity distance @xmath34 : + = c_0^z dz h(z ) , [ eq : lumdis2 ] * the angular - size distance + d_a(z ) = _ 0^z dz h(z ) , [ eq : angdis ] * the deceleration parameter : + [ eq : decel ] q(z ) = ( 1+z ) - 1 , * the effective equation of state of dark energy : [ eq : state0 ] w(z ) = 2 q(z ) - 1 3 , * the age of the universe : + [ eq : age ] t(z ) = _ z^ , * the ` statefinder pair ' @xcite : + r & = & 1 + + ( ) ^2 ( 1+z)^2 - 2(1+z ) , + s & = & , [ eq : state ] * the product @xmath35 , which is used in the alcock - paczynski anisotropy test @xcite , * the product @xmath36 , which plays a key role in the volume - redshift test @xcite .",
    "while providing a common basis for the existence of dark energy , braneworld models b1 , b2 , dde , have important properties and attributes which serve to distinguish these models both from each other , and from alternate models of dark energy such as lcdm & quintessence .",
    "for instance , the luminosity distance in brane1 _ can be larger _ than the luminosity distance in lcdm : @xmath37 .",
    "this follows from ( [ eq : hubble_ineq ] ) and leads to an important result .",
    "namely , using ( [ eq : state0 ] ) we find the current value of the effective equation of state of dark energy :    w_0 = 2 q_0 - 1 3 ( 1 - _ m ) = - 1 - _ m 1 - _ m , from where we see that @xmath38 .",
    "brane1 therefore has the remarkable property that the effective equation of state of dark energy can be more negative than that associated with a cosmological constant ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this feature distinguishes b1 models from lcdm as well as from scalar field based quintessence models .",
    "brane2 has the opposite property , namely @xmath40 , which translates into    -1 w_0 & < & 0 , + where w_0 & = & - 1 + _ m 1 - _ m .",
    "we therefore see that b1 & b2 are complementary models and that the effective equation of state in b1 ( b2 ) is _ softer _ ( stiffer ) than the @xmath41 typical of lcdm . furthermore in both b2 & dde",
    ", the current acceleration of the universe  like earlier matter and radiation dominated epochs  can be a _",
    "transient feature_. in the case of dde , the current accelerating phase will be replaced by a matter dominated epoch during which @xmath42 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dde ] we show the behaviour of the deceleration parameter for this class of models .",
    "it is seen that braneworld dark energy disappears in the future and the universe becomes matter dominated as @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to show that the present value of the effective equation of state of dark energy in dde is given by    [ eq : dde_w ] w_0 = - .    since @xmath44 we find that @xmath45 .",
    "model b2 permits more exotic possibilities . in a subclass of models acceleration",
    "gives way to an epoch during which the universe decelerates at an increasingly rapid rate @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the universe culminates in a ` quiescent singularity ' which is distinguished from conventional general relativistic singularities by the fact that the energy density and hubble parameter _ remain finite _ , while higher derivatives of the scale factor ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 etc . )",
    "diverge , when the ` future singularity ' is reached ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sing ] ) .",
    "( the future singularity , measured from the present epoch , is reached in a few billion years for most b2 type braneworld models @xcite . )",
    "since neither b2 nor dde possess an event horizon both can successfully reconcile the demands of string / m - theory with a universe which is currently accelerating @xcite .",
    "we constrain the parameter space of braneworld cosmology by ensuring that our cosmological models provide a good fit to type ia supernova data .",
    "for this purpose we use the 54 sne ia from the primary ` fit c ' of the supernova cosmology project , which includes 16 low redshift calan - tololo sne @xcite .",
    "fit c is a subsample of a total of 60 sne of which six are excluded as outliers : two low redshift sne due to suspected reddening and four high redshift sne of which two are excluded due to atypical light curves and two because of reddening .",

    "this case is different from the others in that the best fit value of @xmath80 tends to zero for this model .",
    "this behaviour is easily understood in view of the fact that the effective equation of state in this model ( [ eq : dde_w ] ) is always constrained to be @xmath98 and therefore can not be very negative .",

    ". the alcock - paczynski test may not serve this purpose , since both b1 & b2 give results which are close to each other and to those for lcdm .",
    "the reason for this seeming degeneracy lies in the fact that , for b1 ( b2 ) , the hubble parameter @xmath30 _ decreases _ ( increases ) relative to lcdm while the distance @xmath108 _ increases _ ( decreases ) .",
    "thus @xmath30 and @xmath108 show opposing tendencies for the braneworld models , which virtually neutralise each other in the combination @xmath112 .",
    "exactly the opposite effect is achieved by the combination @xmath113 which plays a key role in the volume - redshift test @xcite . in this case",
    "the difference between b1 and b2 becomes more pronounced as demonstrated in figure [ fig : volume ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the volume - redshift test is probably a better means for differentiating between the two braneworld models b1 & b2 than the alcock - paczynski test .",
    "interestingly the statefinder statistic ( [ eq : state ] ) may also provide us with a useful means by which to discriminate between rival braneworld models and lcdm / quintessence , as demonstrated in figures ( [ fig : state1 ] ) & ( [ fig : state2 ] ) .",
    "other cosmological tests which are likely to be useful in testing braneworld models include gravitational lensing @xcite and the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "we shall return to these important issues in a future work .",
    "this paper examines braneworld models of dark energy in the light of recent supernova observations which indicate that the universe is accelerating .",
    "the braneworld models which we examine in this paper have several interesting properties which distinguish them both from the cosmological constant as well as from scalar field based ` tracker ' models of dark energy . like the latter , braneworld models presently accelerate , and possess a longer age than the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) . however in marked contrast to both lcdm and tracker models , the luminosity distance in one class of braneworld models , b1 , can be _",

    "<S> braneworld models of dark energy are examined in the light of observations of high redshift type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> braneworld models admit several novel and even exotic possibilities which include : ( i ) the effective equation of state of dark energy can be more negative than in lcdm : @xmath0 ; ( ii ) a class of braneworld models can encounter a ` quiescent ' future singularity at which the energy density and the hubble parameter remain well behaved , but higher derivatives of the expansion factor ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 etc . ) diverge when the future singularity is reached ; ( iii ) the current acceleration of the universe is a _ transient feature _ in a class of models in which dark energy ` disappears ' after a certain time , giving rise to a matter dominated universe in the future . since horizons are absent in such a space - time , a braneworld model with _ transient acceleration _ might help reconcile current supernova - based observations of an accelerating universe with the demands of string / m - theory . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum likelihood analysis reveals that braneworld models satisfy the stringent demands imposed by high redshift supernovae and a large region in parameter space agrees marginally better with current observations than lcdm . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , models with @xmath3 provide better agreement with data than lcdm for @xmath4 .    </S>"
