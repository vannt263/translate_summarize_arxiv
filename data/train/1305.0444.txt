    "atomic ensembles play an essential and growing role in quantum optics @xcite , with applications in quantum networking @xcite , generation of optical quantum resources @xcite , and quantum - enhanced instruments @xcite . the continuous - variable ( cv ) approach @xcite efficiently describes experiments involving many quanta . the great majority of cv atomic ensemble experiments are performed with gaussian states , although non - gaussian atomic states @xcite are required for some tasks @xcite .",
    "gaussian states can be described very economically in terms of mean values and variances , whereas general states require a description exponential in the size of the system .",
    "madsen and mlmer @xcite introduced a covariance matrix technique to describe collective spin variables in quantum interfaces between light and spin-1/2 ensembles . a wide variety of effects , including spatial and temporal inhomogeneities , loss , decoherence , atomic transport and projective measurements have been incorporated into this framework @xcite .",
    "an important omission until now has been the description of larger - spin systems .",
    "most atomic ensemble experiments are performed with alkali atoms and thus have ground - state spin of at least 1 , which implies tensorial light shifts @xcite and generalized faraday rotation effects @xcite .",
    "an extension of the covariance matrix techniques to include these will allow statistical description of many large - spin applications , including quantum state characterization @xcite and preparation @xcite , quantum chaos @xcite , optical magnetometry @xcite and quantum non - demolition measurement @xcite .    while several earlier works have applied the spin-1/2 framework to spin-1 or larger systems through the identification of a two - state `` pseudo spin-1/2 '' sub - system ,",
    "there are scenarios in which the dynamics naturally involves more than two levels , and requires a more expanded description .",
    "a clear example is a spin-1 or larger atom in the presence of both magnetic and optical fields .",
    "the magnetic field couples zeeman states differing by @xmath2 , whereas the optical fields couple also states with @xmath3 through tensorial light shifts .",
    "this system has been much studied using density - matrix approaches @xcite , which describe fully the average single - atom properties but not the noise properties , which arise from correlations among the atoms .",
    "consideration of the quantum noise in these systems motivates the current work , in which we extend the covariance matrix approach to spin-1 atoms . to the suite of techniques available for spin-1/2 ensembles @xcite",
    ", we add the ability to treat both vectorial and tensorial light shifts , technical noise due to uncertainty in the atom number , and dephasing due to magnetic field inhomogeneities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : formalism ] we present the formalism , which employs eight orientation and alignment operators to describe the @xmath4 collective atomic spin . in section [ sec : dynamics ] we analyze the spin dynamics in the presence of probing light and an external magnetic field , including coherent evolution , decoherence due to scattering of probe photons , and dephasing due to inhomogeneous magnetic fields . in section [ sec : measurement ] we review the description of optical measurement within the covariance matrix formalism . in section [ sec : technicalnoise ] we describe the initial state including technical noise from uncertain atom number . in sections",
    "[ sec : fid ] and [ sec : simulation ] we compare numerical results of our model with experimental data and identify the practical limits of the gaussian approximation in this system .",
    "we work with collective operators describing macroscopic numbers of particles , for which a continuous - variable description is appropriate . throughout",
    ", we use the covariance matrix techniques  @xcite , which are sufficient to describe the gaussian states encountered in the great majority of continuous - variable experiments .      polarized light in continuous variables",
    "can be described with stokes operators : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the annihilation operators for the left and right circular polarization and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 the pauli matrices .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 stokes operators represent respectively linearly polarized light horizontally or vertically , linearly polarized light on the @xmath14 direction , left and right circularly polarized light .",
    "they have the same commutation relations as angular momentum operators , @xmath15 = i \\hat{s}_z$ ] and cyclic permutations .",
    "a single spin-1 atom is described by a density matrix with @xmath16 degrees of freedom , which we express in terms of 8 single - particle operators @xmath17 .",
    "these generalize the pauli matrices , in the sense that they are traceless , hermitian , and obey the orthonormality relation @xmath18 .",
    "the first three operators are the components of the spin vector @xmath19 , obeying @xmath20 = i { \\hat{f}}_z$ ] . for illustration , we give the spin-1 matrix representation :    @xmath21    the others are rank-2 tensor operators , for which we use the symbol @xmath22 , with components ( again with the spin-1 representation for illustration ) : @xmath23 with quantization axis along @xmath24 , @xmath25 describes the population imbalance between @xmath26 and other states , while @xmath27 describe @xmath28 coherences . @xmath29",
    "represent @xmath28 coherences in other quantization axes .",
    "we note that the above operator definitions are spin - independent , and that the results in this manuscript follow from these operator definitions , not from the spin-1-specific matrix representations .",
    "as we shall see below , the most important coherent interactions : larmor precession , faraday rotation , and tensorial light shifts , can be fully described using the above operators , even for larger spin .",
    "the formalism developed here is thus applicable to some scenarios involving spin-3/2 and higher .",
    "not all processes can be explained using just @xmath30 and @xmath22 operators , however .",
    "for example , with spin-2 atoms modulated optical pumping in the presence of a b - field has been used to produce hexadecapole moment due to coherence between zeeman states with @xmath31  @xcite .     of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 operators to the wigner distribution @xmath34 representing the state @xmath35 .",
