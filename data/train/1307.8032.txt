    "function theoretically @xmath8 means that all the critical and asymptotic points of @xmath9 lie over only the finitely many points , say @xmath11 .",

    "therefore the dual graph of @xmath14 is well - defined .",
    "now we denote the dual graph by @xmath17 , and observe that the pull - back of @xmath17 via @xmath9 , @xmath18 , is a connected planar graph that is bipartite and homogeneous of degree @xmath4 .",

    "furthermore , it is known that for fixed base points @xmath11 and the base curve @xmath14 , there is a one - to - one correspondence between ( labeled ) speiser graphs and riemann surfaces of class @xmath0 . for more details , see for example ( * ? ? ?",

    "accordingly we say that the conformal type of @xmath1 is hyperbolic , parabolic , or elliptic , respectively .",
    "thus when we study a riemann surface of class @xmath0 , @xmath23 , the conformal type of @xmath1 should have been already determined even before the meromorphic function @xmath9 was considered . however",

    "in many cases it is even possible to determine the type of @xmath1 from the information about @xmath9 .",

    "the elliptic case is often excluded from the beginning and @xmath1 is assumed to be _",

    "now the vel - parabolicity of @xmath45 follows from the vel - parabolicity of @xmath208 and lemma  [ l : finer ] .",

    "if either the speiser graph corresponding to @xmath3 or its dual is vel - hyperbolic , @xmath3 is of cp hyperbolic type .",
    "[ remk ] it would be more natural to define cp type for every surfaces of class @xmath0 , even in the presence of asymptotic values .",
    "thus suppose @xmath23 and let @xmath19 be its corresponding speiser graph .",
    "the graph @xmath19 would have some infinite faces when @xmath9 has asymptotic values , but we can still divide each _",
    "finite _ face of @xmath19 into triangles , and obtain a graph similar to @xmath216 described before corollary  [ hyperbolic ] .    the obtained graph , which we still denote by @xmath216 , is no longer a disk triangulation graph , but it is possible to check if @xmath216 is vel - parabolic or hyperbolic .",
    "thus we can naturally extend the definition of cp types , even in the presence of asymptotic values , according to the cp type of @xmath216 ; i.e. , we can define that @xmath23 is cp parabolic if and only if @xmath216 is vel - parabolic .",
    "suppose a speiser graph @xmath19 is given .",
    "if @xmath19 is vel - hyperbolic , then corollary  [ hyperbolic ] implies that the corresponding surface @xmath8 is cp hyperbolic . on the other hand ,",
    "since every speiser graph is of bounded valence , vel - hyperbolicity of @xmath19 is equivalent to its transiency , which then implies hyperbolicity of @xmath1 ( @xcite or @xcite ; see the doyle s criterion below ) .",
    "therefore the conformal and cp types agree in this case .",
    "if @xmath19 is vel - parabolic ( hence recurrent ) , however , the cp type of @xmath1 could be either one . note that the disk triangulation graph @xmath216 described before corollary  [ hyperbolic ] is a semi - bounded refinement graph of @xmath19 , but the proof for lemma  [ l : cfiner ] does not work in this case since @xmath19 is not a triangulation .",
    "definitely neither does the vel - parabolicity of @xmath19 guarantee the parabolicity of @xmath1 in the conformal type , so one has to investigate recurrent speiser graphs for a riemann surface of class @xmath0 with different cp and conformal types .",
    "our strategy is to construct a speiser graph whose growth rate is very slow so that the corresponding surface is conformally parabolic , while its dual graph is vel - hyperbolic",
    ". then the surface will be cp hyperbolic by corollary  [ hyperbolic ] .",
    "first , we start with a speiser graph @xmath230 such that both the graph @xmath231 and its dual graph @xmath232 are vel - hyperbolic .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath231 we pick the regular graph of degree 3 such that every face of it is an octagon , so that the dual graph @xmath232 is a regular graph of degree 8 which is a disk triangulation .",
    "fix a vertex @xmath233 of @xmath231 , and let @xmath234 be the combinatorial sphere of radius @xmath235 and centered at @xmath233 ; that is , @xmath234 is the set of vertices in @xmath236 whose combinatorial distance from @xmath233 is equal to @xmath235",
    ". let @xmath237 be the combinatorial ball of radius @xmath235 and centered at @xmath233 , and let @xmath238 be the set of edges in @xmath239 with one end on @xmath234 and the other end on @xmath240 .",
    "we next choose a sequence of natural numbers ( odd numbers ) @xmath241 which will be determined later .",
    "then for each edge in @xmath242 , we replace it by an unbranched tree of length @xmath243 so that the graph remains to be a speiser graph .",
    "note that every speiser graph is bipartite , so the vertex set @xmath236 is divided into two classes , say vertices tagged with @xmath218 and those with @xmath219 , and every edge must connect two vertices with different tags .",
    "moreover , @xmath231 is the regular graph of degree 3 with octagonal faces , thus in order to make the modified graph remain to be a speiser graph , the number @xmath243 must be odd and every second edge in this unbranched tree of length @xmath243 must be a double edge ( figure  [ br ] ) .",
    "the resulting graph @xmath247 we have just obtained from this process is a speiser graph whose dual graph @xmath24 is vel - hyperbolic .",
    "this is because @xmath24 contains @xmath232 as a subgraph , and we chose @xmath232 to be vel - hyperbolic .",
    "we conclude that the surface @xmath8 associated with @xmath19 is cp hyperbolic by corollary  [ hyperbolic ] .",
    "it remains to show that the surface @xmath8 associated with @xmath19 is conformally parabolic , for which we use the criterion of dolye ( @xcite ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) : ` the riemann surface of class @xmath0 associated with a given speiser graph is parabolic if and only if the corresponding _",
    "extended speiser graph _ is recurrent ' .",
    "note that the extended speiser graph of a given speiser graph is a planar graph with _ infinitely many ends _",
    ", obtained by adding infinitely many square grids to all the faces of the speiser graph ( figure  [ es ] ) .",
    "let @xmath248 be the extended speiser graph obtained from @xmath19 , and note that the vertex @xmath233 of @xmath231 , the center of the spheres and balls in the construction of @xmath19 , may be regarded as a vertex in @xmath19 , or even as a vertex in @xmath249 .",
    "now we let @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 be combinatorial spheres and balls in @xmath19 and @xmath249 , respectively , with centered at @xmath233 and radius @xmath235 .",
    "depending on the growth rate of @xmath254 , the number of vertices in @xmath255 , we can choose the sequence @xmath256 increasing so fast that @xmath257 for sufficiently large @xmath163 .",
    "more specifically , we have @xmath258 since @xmath231 is a regular graph of degree 3 .",
    "this means that @xmath259 for @xmath260 .",
    "thus if we define @xmath261 , then for @xmath262 we have @xmath263    on the other hand , @xmath249 is a graph whose vertices have degree at most @xmath264 such that for each @xmath265 and @xmath266 there are exactly @xmath267 vertices in @xmath268 which are directly _ @xmath73 steps above _ @xmath53 . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath53 has distance @xmath269 from @xmath233 , then only 3 vertices in @xmath268 are directly above @xmath53 and have distance @xmath73 from @xmath53",
    ". therefore we must have @xmath270 for sufficiently large @xmath163 .",
    "therefore there exists a constant @xmath271 such that @xmath272 for sufficiently large @xmath163 . since @xmath249 is of bounded valence , the nash - williams criterion ( cf .",
