    "modelling a dynamical system has become one of the most challenging subjects among scientists including physicists and mathematicians over years @xcite . the modelling helps to understand in many cases how does the system evolves in time @xcite was well as its description in parameter space @xcite and whether it has or not a steady state @xcite .",
    "often the investigation leads to nonlinear dynamics @xcite where complex structures can be observed in the phase space @xcite . for conservative systems ,",
    "the phase space may be classified under three different classes namely : ( i ) regular @xcite where only periodic and quasi periodic orbits are present ; ( ii ) mixed @xcite whose phase space exhibits a coexistence of period , quasi periodic and chaotic behaviour and ; ( iii ) ergodic @xcite where only unstable and therefore unpredictable orbits are observed . for dissipative systems",
    "@xcite the structure of the phase space commonly has attractors @xcite that can be periodic @xcite or chaotic @xcite .    in the large majority of the cases ,",
    "a dynamical system is mostly governed by a set of differential equations .",
    "quite often too they are coupled to each other . however , depending on the conserved quantities and symmetries , solutions of differential equations can be qualitatively ( and many times quantitatively too ) transformed into an application described by nonlinear mappings @xcite .",
    "the mappings are characterised by discrete time evolution and have also a set of control parameters .",
    "indeed they can control either the nonlinearity @xcite as well as the dissipation itself @xcite .",
    "the variation of the control parameters may lead quite often to the so called phase transitions @xcite . in statistical mechanics",
    ", phase transitions are linked to abrupt changes in spatial structure of the system @xcite and mainly due to variations of control parameters . in a dynamical system",
    "however , a phase transition is particularly related to modifications in the structure of the phase space of the system @xcite . therefore near a phase transition",
    ", the dynamics of the system is described by the use of a scaling function @xcite where critical exponents characterise the dynamics near the criticality .    in this paper",
    "we revisit a bouncer model @xcite particularly focused on the description of some of its thermodynamical properties .",
    "the system consists of a classical particle , or in the same way an ensemble of non interacting particles , moving under the action of a constant gravitational field and suffering collisions with a moving platform .",
    "we are seeking then to understand and describe how does the system goes to the steady state for long enough time and how the control parameters influence the way the system goes . for the conservative case and depending on the control parameters @xcite , the system exhibits unlimited diffusion in energy @xcite which is called as fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "if the particles are considered as a sufficiently light , an ensemble of them may constitute an ideal gas .",
    "therefore the unlimited diffusion in energy is in contrast with what is observed in day life .",
    "if we consider the moving wall as produced by atomic oscillations in a solid due to thermal heating with a constant external temperature @xmath0 , a gas in a room does not absorbs infinite energy leading it to have unbound growth of temperature .",
    "therefore fermi acceleration is a phenomenon that can not occur in gases and most probably is due to the fact that dissipation is present .",
    "because the gas is of low density and particles are non interacting with each other , we consider the dissipation is due to inelastic collisions of the particles with the moving wall , but the particles do not interact between themselves . when interactions among the particles are considered , the system can be described as a granular material @xcite allowing physical observables to be characterised @xcite either in the presence @xcite or absence @xcite of gravitational field .",
    "such approach is not considered in this paper given we are considering non interaction particles with low density . in model considered in this paper",
    "we introduce a dissipation parameter , more specifically a restitution coefficient , and describe the evolution of the system",
    ". then the introduction of inelastic collisions of the particle with the wall suppresses the diffusion in energy .",
    "the evolution towards the stationary state for long enough time is described in two limits : ( i ) if the initial energy of the gas is sufficiently large and ; ( ii ) if it is sufficiently small .",
    "for case ( i ) we prove an exponential decay is happening while for ( ii ) a power law marked by a changeover to the steady state is observed .",
    "we obtain so far a relation of the number of collisions and time and write the relevant observables like squared velocity , temperature of the gas and entropy as a function of either number of collisions and time .",
    "the system is show to be scaling invariant with respect to the control parameters and we found analytically the critical exponents describing a homogeneous generalised function . at the end",
    "we present some comparisons of the results obtained with typical values of known atomic oscillations as well as frequency of oscillation at a given temperature .",
    "our results indicate the inelastic collisions are responsible for suppressing the energy s unlimited diffusion of the gas .",
    "an estimation of a restitution coefficient is given for hydrogen molecule colliding with a solid made of copper .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe the model , give the expressions of the conservative and dissipative maps .",
    "unlimited diffusion for energy is shown also for the conservative case .",
    "the stationary state and the evolution towards it is given here as a theoretical prediction .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to discuss the numerical results as well as the scaling properties .",
    "the critical exponents are obtained from either theoretical point of view as well as from numerical simulations .",
    "a scaling invariance for the ensemble of particles in a gas is confirmed by an overlap of different curves of average velocity onto a single and universal plot , after properly rescaling of the axis . as the system is constructed and described in terms of the number of collisions , section [ sec4 ] deals specifically with a connection of number of collisions and time .",
    "the latter being in principle easier to be measured in a real experiment .",
    "section [ sec5 ] discusses the connections with the thermodynamics finding particularly the expressions of the temperature of the gas , squared velocity as well as an expression for the entropy . both as function of number of collisions as well as the time .",
    "short discussion on the results are presented in section [ sec6 ] where , from our model , an estimation of the restitution coefficient for collisions of hydrogen molecule is given .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "the model we consider in this paper consists of a classical particle , or an ensemble of non interacting particles , moving in the presence of a constant gravitational field @xmath1 suffering collisions with a time moving wall .",
    "the equation that describes the moving wall is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the amplitude of the moving wall while @xmath4 is the angular frequency .",
    "we suppose the gas of particles has a low density in the sense the particles are free to move with a constant mechanical energy without interacting with each other .",
    "they indeed exchange energy upon collisions with the moving wall . depending on the phase of the moving wall the particles can gain or lose energy .",
    "it is assumed the motion of the particles is allowed only in the vertical direction , therefore making allusions to a simplified one - dimensional gas .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a schematic description of the model .",
    "the dynamics of each individual particle , as usual in the literature @xcite , is described by a two - dimensional and nonlinear map for the variables velocity of the particle @xmath5 and time @xmath6 at each impact with the boundary . for a simplified gas model , the moving platform",
    "may be represented by a rigid wall or even the ground and the motion can be caused by the atomic oscillations at the edge of the wall . because such atomic oscillations are too small @xcite as compared to the positions or displacements made by each particle , we can approximate the description by assuming the time of flight of each particle is calculated as if the wall was fixed . however , the exchange of energy is determined by a moving wall .",
    "this approach is reasonable because the atomic oscillations are from the order of @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) . under this assumption ,",
    "the mapping is written as @xmath8~{\\rm mod~(2 \\pi/\\omega ) } \\\\",

    "\\label{eq2}\\ ] ] the modulus used in the second equation is introduced to avoid a specific situation .",
    "after the collisions , there could be a small possibility of the particle present a negative velocity .",
    "this case has no physical meaning in the model because the wall is assumed to be fixed in order to make easier the calculation of the time of flights",
    ". then a particle moving with a negative velocity after the collision is forbidden .",
    "if such a case happens , the particle is injected back to the dynamics with the same velocity but with a positive direction .",

    "is observed . for a specific range of control parameters , this leads to an unlimited diffusion in velocity @xcite therefore characterising a phenomenon called as fermi acceleration @xcite . as a physical interpretation from a thermodynamical point of view",
    ", it would leads to an infinite temperature of a classical gas .",
    "this is quite contradictory to what is observed in real experiments or in day life . on the other hand when inelastic collisions are taken into account ,",
    "the unlimited diffusion of the velocity of the ensemble of particles is suppressed , leading to a finite temperature most in agreement to what is confirmed in experiments .",
    "we discuss both cases separately .",
    "let us discuss in this section the behaviour of the average velocity for an ensemble of particles for the restitution coefficient @xmath11 . under this condition",
    ", the mapping simplifies to @xmath8~{\\rm mod~(2 \\pi/\\omega ) } \\\\",

    "there are few steps we have to proceed to make a connection between the two models : ( 1 ) multiply first equation of map ( [ eq3 ] ) by @xmath4 ; ( 2 ) multiply the second equation of map ( [ eq3 ] ) by @xmath12 ; ( 3 ) define both @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; ( 4 ) define @xmath15 .",

    "[ fig2 ] confirms the unlimited growth of the average velocity , leading to the phenomenon of fermi acceleration .",
    "however , it is in disagreement with experimental results because a temperature in a room can not grow unbound . in next section",
    "we consider the dynamics under the effects of inelastic collisions .",

    "this is indeed a quite strong mathematical result .",
    "according to liouville s theorem @xcite , area contraction in the phase space is happening , therefore for any @xmath36 attractors must exist in the phase space .",

    "let us discuss in this section the possible connections with the thermodynamics for the one - dimensional bouncer model .",
    "the first step is the discussion of the temperature .",
    "the connection of the squared velocity with the temperature comes from the energy equipartition theorem @xcite .",
    "indeed , the theorem says that each quadratic term in the expression of the hamiltonian ( energy ) of the system contributes with @xmath144 in the thermal energy .",
    "here @xmath145 stands for the boltzmann constant . to apply the theorem , the system must be in equilibrium , i.e. , reached the steady state .",
    "however , we want to describe the evolution of the temperature as function of both @xmath23 and time @xmath6 , which may not be at equilibrium yet .",
    "we notice however there are basically two time scales involved in this problem .",
    "one of them is the time the particle spends travelling around ( up and down ) in between the collisions .",
    "this is a measurable time in the laboratory .",
    "the other one , which is several order of magnitude different , smaller indeed , is the period of an atomic oscillation , which is governed by the frequency of oscillation @xmath4 . then between one collision and the other , the atom has completed several thousands of billions of oscillations . therefore between collisions , it can be considered that , from the scale of atomic oscillation , the velocity of the particle is almost constant , allowing to apply the theorem . in this way we have @xmath146 yielding to @xmath147    the four important expressions we have then in connection with the thermodynamics are the squared velocity and the temperature , both written as function of @xmath23 and time @xmath6 , as given below .",
    "the first one is the squared velocity as function of @xmath23 @xmath45~. \\label{eq55}\\ ] ] the second is the temperature as function of @xmath23 too , @xmath148~. \\label{eq56}\\ ] ] the third and fourth are obtained from the eqs .",
    "( [ eq55 ] ) and ( [ eq56 ] ) but using the result given by eq .",
    "( [ eq52 ] ) . the squared velocity and temperature as a function of time",
    "are then written as @xmath149~,\\label{eq57}\\\\ t(t)&=&t_0e^{(\\gamma^2 - 1){{g\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}}\\over{2\\epsilon\\omega}}t}+ { { ( 1+\\gamma)}\\over{2}}{{\\epsilon^2\\omega^2}\\over{(1-\\gamma)}}{{m}\\over{k_b } } \\left [ 1-e^{(\\gamma^2 - 1){{g\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}}\\over{2\\epsilon\\omega}}t}\\right]~. \\label{eq58}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    other observable that can be obtained from the system is the entropy .",
    "since we are considering the measure of the velocity of the particle at the instant of the collisions , the kinetic energy can then be written as @xmath150    it is known @xcite however that @xmath151 that yields to @xmath152 where @xmath153 then we obtain that @xmath154 doing the integral we have @xmath155 where @xmath156 is given by @xmath157 .",
    "equation ( [ eq64 ] ) can also be written in terms of the temperature , i.e. @xmath158~. \\label{eq65}\\ ] ]    the result given by eq .",
    "( [ eq64 ] ) shows the entropy is dependent on the energy and grows with the increase of the energy , which is already expected for an ideal gas @xcite .",
    "either eqs .",
    "( [ eq64 ] ) and ( [ eq65 ] ) must be applied with some care , particularly in the domain of low energy , implying in low temperature .",
    "this is because at such regime , the entropy may assume negative values .",
    "worst than that is that it can accelerate to @xmath159 in the limit of @xmath160 .",
    "of course in such a limit our approach is not valid anymore and quantum description must be made .",
    "in this section we discuss our results obtained for the steady state regime .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq58 ] ) for long enough time , i.e. , @xmath161 , we obtain @xmath162 the knowledge of the quantities @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 allow us to make an estimation of the restitution coefficient @xmath9 . therefore isolating @xmath9 from eq .",
    "( [ eq66 ] ) we end up with @xmath165    to make an estimation of @xmath9 we shall consider a light molecule , hydrogen ( @xmath166 ) indeed whose atomic mass is @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "we suppose also the molecule is colliding with a copper wall at room temperature @xmath169 . from ref .",
    "@xcite , the frequency of oscillation is @xmath170 .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation comes from ref .",
    "@xcite , but we must give a short discussion first .    according to the theoretical models of lattices ,",
    "a cubic lattice is formed by atoms placed on each corner of a cube and also with an atom at each face of the cube .",
    "then the lattice spacing describes the distance between two adjacent corners of the cube . by knowing the lattice spacing we",
    "make the following assumption .",
    "an atom can not vibrate freely .",
    "due to the bonds with other atoms , it must vibrate only around its equilibrium position .",
    "we assume for doing the estimation of @xmath9 that each atom oscillates with at most 5 percent of the lattice spacing ( which may still be much ) . then according to @xcite , @xmath171 , yielding in @xmath172 .    with the numerical values of the parameters at hand , we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq67 ] ) and found a naive estimation for the restitution coefficient of @xmath173 .    using this result to be applied in eq .",
    "( [ eq57 ] ) yields a velocity of @xmath174 .",
    "the model presented in this paper then succeeded well to argue on the suppression of fermi acceleration and making a temperature finite in a gas .",
    "it may also present some applicability to estimate the restitution coefficient , what should be tested experimentally .",
    "however , it fails to estimate with good accuracy the velocity of a hydrogen molecule in a gas at room temperature .",
    "our result furnishes @xmath175 of the velocity measured from a hydrogen as an ideal gas at room temperature in 3-d space @xcite .",
    "the sub index @xmath176 stands for boltzmann velocity .",
    "we have considered in this paper the dynamics of a one - dimensional bouncer model as an approximation to describe a gas of classical particles moving along an axis under the influence of gravity .",
    "as it is known in the literature @xcite , we confirmed that when a conservative case is considered , depending on the set of control parameters @xcite , unlimited diffusion is observed for the velocity of the particle , leading to a phenomenon of fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "however , this unlimited diffusion is not what one may observe in a laboratory .",
    "therefore , when inelastic collisions are taken into account , the unlimited diffusion was suppressed @xcite and we have shown two different scenarios evolving towards the stationary state . for large initial velocity , we prove that decay of the particle is described by an exponential function with the speed of the decay depending on the amount of the dissipation , namely @xmath177 . for very low initial velocity , we have shown the average velocity grows until bends towards a regime of convergence , indicating the steady state was reached .",
    "the stationary state depends on the control parameters as @xmath178 .",
    "the crossover marking the change from growth to the saturation depends on the dissipation @xmath179 and is not dependent on @xmath3 .",
    "a scaling law describing such behaviour was obtained .",
    "the connection with the thermodynamics was made by using the equipartition theorem @xcite .",
    "we found expressions for the temperature as well as squared velocity in variables @xmath23 , denoting the number of collisions of the particles with the wall , and @xmath6 , which is the time .",
    "the later was only possible to obtain because the scaled velocity was described by an empirical function @xcite relating explicitly velocity @xmath5 and @xmath23 , as requested by the procedure .",
    "the expression of @xmath180 so far is more convenient from experimental point of view and can be measured directly in the laboratory .",
    "an expression for the entropy was also obtained .",
    "it has validity only for the regime of temperature sufficiently large in the sense quantum effects are negligible .",
    "finally a comparison of the results obtained from the model was made with data obtained from @xcite and @xcite considering standard vibrations of atoms as well as frequencies and amplitudes .",
    "our result indicate a restitution coefficient for the hydrogen of @xmath173 experiencing collisions with a cooper platform at room temperature . therefore an experiment must be made as an attempt to confirm possibly the result obtained for @xmath9 .",
    "as discussed above , our model however fails to predict with accuracy the average velocity of a gas at room temperature since our result for 1-d model gives @xmath181 , for the case considered in the discussion . here",
