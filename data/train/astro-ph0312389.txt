    "inflation is part of the modern cosmological standard paradigm because some inflationary models can fit the observations @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is often argued that the `` simplest '' inflationary models @xcite yield a homogeneous , isotropic , spatially flat universe slightly perturbed by a nearly scale invariant spectrum of gaussian , adiabatic density perturbations .",
    "however , one has to be cautious to generically ascribe to inflation the successes of only a particular set of models .",
    "in fact , there are inflationary scenarios that yield anisotropic @xcite , open @xcite or closed @xcite universes , strongly tilted spectra @xcite and , in multiple - field models , non - gaussian @xcite or non - adiabatic @xcite perturbations . as it turns out , even single - field inflationary models can also produce significant amounts of isocurvature perturbations .",
    "the simplest inflationary models fall within the class of single - field models . in the latter ,",
    "inflation is driven by a single field , the inflaton , which is assumed to be the only relevant dynamical component during inflation ( in addition to the metric ) .",
    "in particular , perturbations are imprinted only on the inflaton field .",
    "after inflation , these perturbations are transferred to the decay products of the inflaton during reheating .",
    "reheating therefore is an integral part of any inflationary model . without reheating ,",
    "the universe would end up dominated by a scalar field in an otherwise empty universe .",
    "the reheating mechanism also affects the predictions of inflationary models , since observable quantities , like the spectral index , depend on the reheating temperature .",
    "it is believed that , regardless of the details of the reheating stage , the density perturbations seeded during single - field inflation remain adiabatic .",
    "historically , the first works @xcite that partially justified this belief assumed that the inflaton decays into a single component .",
    "if the inflaton completely decays into a single component during reheating , only that component emerges and survives the reheating stage , so no entropy perturbations are possible .",
    "if the inflaton decays into several components , it has been argued @xcite that perturbations are expected to be adiabatic , though i am not aware of a general rigorous proof of adiabaticity . in fact , such a proof would be quite difficult to construct , as the couplings of the inflaton to matter and the inner workings of the reheating mechanism are hardly ever specified or actually known .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that , indeed , perturbations seeded during a stage of single - field inflation can be non - adiabatic . in order to do so",
    ", it will be enough to construct a single counter - example .",
    "the essential element of the counter - example is the non - universal dependence of the inflaton decay rates on a spacetime - varying quantity , which happens to be the total energy density in this particular case .",
    "this asymmetry in the decay rates finally results in the generation of entropy perturbations from perturbations that are initially adiabatic .",
    "our goal is to describe the reheating process at the end of single - field inflation and to compute the amplitudes of density perturbations at the end of reheating .",
    "the basics of reheating are reviewed in @xcite , which focuses on background quantities . in order to follow the evolution of perturbations ,",
    "additional machinery is needed .",
    "here , i will rely on the formalism developed in @xcite , which extends the work of @xcite .",
    "this formalism has been applied in related contexts by several authors @xcite .",
    "suppose that the inflationary stage is driven by the inflaton @xmath0 .",
    "after the end of inflation @xmath0 oscillates around the minimum of its potential and decays into the particles it couples to . in order to describe the decay process it is convenient to resort to a perfect fluid description of the different components involved",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 generically denote their pressure and energy density .",
    "these fluids might include the inflaton ( @xmath3 ) , radiation ( @xmath4 ) or dark matter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "when referring to a generic component , be it the inflaton or its decay components , i use greek subindices ( @xmath6 ) . when referring to the decay components of the inflaton i use latin lower - case ones ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the inflaton is labeled by @xmath0 .",
    "after the end of a sufficiently long period of scalar - driven inflation the universe is homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat .",
    "in such a universe , the background equations of motion of the different fluids during the reheating process are @xmath8 where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time , @xmath9 is the hubble constant , and @xmath10 .",
    "the term on the right - hand side of the equation accounts for the decay of the inflaton @xmath0 into the different matter fields .",
    "in particular , @xmath11 is the decay rate of the inflaton into the fluid @xmath12 .",
    "conservation of the total energy - momentum tensor then implies @xmath13 it is conventionally assumed that the ( scalar ) decay rates @xmath14 are constant . here",
    ", we shall be general and allow spacetime - dependent ones @xcite . in single - field inflation",
    ", spacetime - varying decay rates can arise for instance from a dependence on the inflaton @xmath0 , or on the temperature of radiation , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "more generally , one could consider decay rates that depend on the different energy densities , @xmath17 , which keeps the system of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bmotion ] ) closed . in the following ,",
    "i assume for simplicity that the decay rates only depend on the total energy density , @xmath18 . though this last assumption is not an essential ingredient of the counter - example",
    ", it will considerably simplify the analytical treatment of the equations .",
    "if the inflaton potential @xmath19 around its minimum @xmath20 has the form @xmath21 , on average , the oscillating inflaton behaves as a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath22 @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", i shall assume that all the fluids have the same equation of state @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , i assume that the inflaton has the same ( constant ) equation of state as its decay products @xmath24 .",
    "this assumption is also realistic , as we could consider a quartic potential for an inflaton that decays into relativistic particles ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "if the decay rates only depend on @xmath31 , then it is also possible to integrate eq .",

    "let me at this point assume a particular functional dependence of @xmath14 . expand the decay rates in a series in inverse cosmic time , and neglect terms of quadratic or higher order . because the @xmath14 depend on the total energy density , this translates into @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are two constant coefficients , and @xmath29 is again the total energy density at the initial time @xmath30 . at any rate",

    "spatially flat gauge , the perturbed metric has the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are scalar metric perturbations .",
    "this gauge turns to be convenient because in the long - wavelength limit , where one expects spatial divergence of the three - momentum and the shear gradient to be negligible @xcite , the perturbation equations do not explicitly contain metric perturbations , @xmath53 to arrive at this expression , i have substituted eq .",

    "entropy perturbations arise whenever the @xmath68 are different for different fluid species .",
    "a gauge invariant quantity that characterizes such entropy perturbations is @xmath70 entropy perturbations are important because they source changes in @xmath67 . assuming that the perfect fluids have a constant equation of state parameter , the @xmath67 equation of motion is @xmath71 therefore , in the absence of entropy perturbations @xmath67 is a conserved quantity ( recall that we only deal here with large scales ) .",
    "this conservation law has a counterpart for the individual @xmath72 .",
    "it can be also shown @xcite that once the inflaton has decayed , @xmath72 remains constant if the fluid @xmath12 is isentropic , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , after inflaton decay @xmath74 is constant on large scales , regardless of how @xmath67 evolves .",
    "current experimental results are consistent with a primordial spectrum of adiabatic perturbations @xcite , though significant isocurvature components are still allowed @xcite . by definition ,",
    "perturbations are non - adiabatic if @xmath75 is nonzero for any pair of fluids .",
    "suppose momentarily that the decay rates are of the form @xmath76 where @xmath38 is a constant and @xmath77 is any function of the total energy density that is common for all species . because both @xmath64 and @xmath78 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : drhoaintegral ] ) and ( [ eq : rhointegrals ] ) are proportional to @xmath79 , this constant cancels in the ratio @xmath72 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zetaalpha ] ) .",
    "consequently , there are no entropy perturbations in the matter sector , @xmath80 . in principle",
    ", entropy perturbations could arise in the inflaton - matter sector , @xmath81 .",
    "however , if the inflaton decays completely , both its background energy density and perturbations vanish , so they do not contribute to the matter budget of the universe after reheating ; primordial perturbations might then be effectively regarded as adiabatic .",
    "an alternative interesting  albeit somewhat remote ",
    "possibility is an inflaton that does not completely decay , say , because its decay rate drops to zero sufficiently fast .",
    "this frustrated decay might then lead to an inflaton which at late times comes to dominate the universe as a dark matter form for instance . anyway , to summarize : if eq .",
    "( [ eq : cadiabatic ] ) holds and the inflaton entirely decays , perturbations are still adiabatic after reheating , @xmath80 .",
    "if there is more than one component involved in the decay of the inflaton , say , dark matter ( @xmath82 ) and radiation ( @xmath83 ) , and if the decay rates are not constants , there is no reason to expect relation ( [ eq : cadiabatic ] ) to hold . in that case one _ generically _ expects non - adiabatic perturbations .",
    "the source of these non - adiabatic perturbations is the asymmetry in the evolution of the different decay rates . to illustrate the issue ,",
    "let me consider the following simple case : @xmath84 inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : example ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhoagamma ] ) and ( [ eq : drhoagamma ] ) , and using the definitions ( [ eq : zetaalpha ] ) and ( [ eq : entropy ] ) i find that the radiation - matter entropy perturbation is given by @xmath85.\\ ] ] fig .",
    "[ fig : relative ] shows the relative entropy perturbation @xmath86 as a function of @xmath87 and @xmath88 . as clearly seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig : relative ] , the relative entropy perturbation is significant ( i.e. of order one ) for almost any set of decay rates . in particular , in the limit @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the sudden drop of the relative entropy perturbation around @xmath91 is due to the breakdown of our results for that value ( there is no exponential suppression in integrals like ( [ eq : rhointegrals ] ) ) .",
    "( @xmath92-axis ) as a function of @xmath93 ( @xmath94-axis ) and @xmath95 ( @xmath96-axis ) . for a large set of decay rates ,",
    "isocurvature perturbations are significant .",
    "note that @xmath97 or @xmath98 are ill - defined limits ( there is no decay into matter or radiation ) .",
    "[ fig : relative ] ]    a feature of this concrete example that i expect to survive in models with less assumptions is the linear dependence of the matter density perturbations on the initial density perturbation @xmath99 .",
    "hence , if entropy perturbations originate from reheating after single field inflation , the spectral indices of entropy and curvature perturbations should be identical , and entropy and curvature modes should be also completely correlated . though this seems plausible and",
    "might simply follow from linearity of the equations , as i mentioned at the beginning one should be cautious to generalize statements only known to apply in particular cases .    although our example does indeed contain non - adiabatic perturbations , the bardeen variable @xmath67 remains constant on large scales , eq .",
    "( [ eq : contrast ] ) .",
    "this happens because all components have the same equation of state .",
    "the last feature though was introduced in the counter - example merely to simplify the equations , and it is likely that if the assumption @xmath100 is dropped while maintaining the non - universal time - dependence of the decay rates , isocurvature perturbations are still going to be generated during reheating .    but even if we maintain the assumption of common equation of state during reheating , it is possible to generate changes in @xmath67 on large scales .",
    "suppose for instance that the inflaton decays into radiation ( @xmath83 ) and a sufficiently light species of dark matter particles ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "though dark matter might behave as a relativistic component during reheating ( @xmath101 ) , once its temperature later drops below its mass , it will start behaving as a pressureless component @xmath102 .",
    "the non - vanishing ( and constant ) entropy perturbation @xmath103 will then , since @xmath104 , source changes in @xmath67 on large scales and have a significant impact on structure formation @xcite .",
    "in order to show that single - field inflation does not generically produce a spectrum of adiabatic perturbations , it is sufficient to present a single counter - example . in this paper ,",
    "i have described a toy reheating process that yields significant amounts of non - adiabatic perturbations after single - field inflation .",
    "the example contains several ingredients .",
    "some of them them are superfluous , and their sole purpose is to simplify the analysis .",
    "others are essential , and their presence alone is likely to produce non - adiabatic perturbations during reheating .",
    "the essential ingredient here is the `` non - universal '' spacetime dependence of the rates at which the inflaton decays into different components .",
    "obviously , such an asymmetric dependence can only occur if the inflaton decays into more than one fluid ( radiation and dark matter for instance ) . as a caveat ,",
    "let me mention that i have neglected spatial divergences of the momentum and the shear gradient in the equations of motion for the perturbations .",
    "these terms are expected to be negligible in the long - wavelength limit , though in order to rigorously asses their importance , one should deal with equations of motion containing a single variable @xcite .",
    "is such a non - universal behavior of the decay rates expected to occur in realistic models ?",
    "the universe contains several constituents , like baryons , dark matter , photons , neutrinos and quintessence , so there is no reason for the inflaton to decay into a single component .",
    "in addition , reheating proceeds in different stages .",
    "initially , parametric amplification is responsible for an explosive production of particles known as preheating and subsequently , the inflaton decays by conventional ( and essentially different ) perturbative processes @xcite . during this last stage of reheating particles",
    "might also acquire thermal masses , which again render the inflaton decay rate spacetime - dependent @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is extremely plausible that the inflaton decay rate could depend on spacetime quantities @xcite . on top of that",
    ", the decay products of the inflaton might be very different , like dark matter and radiation are , so there is no reason to assume that their couplings to the inflaton and , hence , their corresponding creation rates are related to each other .",
    "overall , it might very well be that the decay rates evolve in a non - universal way . in that case , rather than a spectrum of adiabatic perturbations , the signature that points to the single - field origin of the entropy perturbations in our example is the complete correlation of entropy and curvature modes , and the common spectral index .    the counter - example presented here does not imply that single - field inflation is in conflict with observations .",
    "first , significant amounts of isocurvature are still allowed by experiment @xcite .",
    "second , there are models where perturbations still remain adiabatic after reheating .",
    "in fact , the mechanism i have described can be regarded from a different perspective .",
    "little is known about the physics of reheating .",
    "hence , the possibility that isocurvature perturbations can be efficiently produced during reheating might , together with observational constraints , shed a fair amount of light into our understanding and modeling of the reheating process after a stage of single - field inflation .",
    "after this preprint was posted on the archive , s. weinberg and s. bashinsky kindly pointed out to me that , under quite general assumptions , the adiabaticity of the perturbations generated during a stage of single - field inflation follows from the results presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as suggested by them , the origin of the non - adiabatic perturbations discussed here is the discontinuous change of the decay rate along a spatial hypersurface where the total energy density is perturbed @xcite .",
    "such a change makes the perturbations non - adiabatic already at the beginning of reheating .",
    "the nature of the perturbations generated during a stage of single - field inflation is specifically analyzed in @xcite .    it is a pleasure to thank sean carroll , rocky kolb , eugene lim and slava mukhanov for useful comments and remarks .",
    "i m specially indebted to chris gordon , wayne hu and lam hui for extensive and challenging discussions .",
    "finally , i want to thank also sergei bashinsky and steven weinberg for clarifying correspondence .",
