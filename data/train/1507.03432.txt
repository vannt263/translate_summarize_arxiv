    "the elastic rod theory is an old , extensively studied , but still current topic of research .",
    "its foundations date back to , among others , bernoulli , kirchhoff @xcite , the brothers cosserat @xcite and love @xcite . a comprehensive overview from today s perspective",
    "is given in , for example @xcite .",
    "the investigations range from analytical aspects such as solution theory , stability and hamiltonian structure to numerical methods ( geometrically exact approaches , exact energy - momentum conserving algorithms and symplectic schemes ) , of the broad literature see e.g.   @xcite and @xcite .",
    "equally large is the field of applications : engineering mechanics ( truss , fiber - reinforced materials , non - woven textiles , paper ) , biomolecular science ( dna , bacterial fibers ) , computer graphics etc .    in this paper",
    "the specific focus lies on the asymptotic investigation of the relation between the dynamic cosserat rod model and the kirchhoff beam equations to describe the motion of slender elastic bodies . a rod in the special cosserat theory @xcite is represented by two constitutive elements : a parameterized time - dependent curve @xmath1 and an attached orthonormal director triad @xmath2 that specify the position and the orientation of the material cross - sections .",
    "its deformation is due to tension , shear , bending and torsion . for general elastic material laws we derive beam equations of kirchhoff - type in an asymptotic analysis , as the slenderness parameter @xmath3 ( ratio between rod diameter and length ) and the mach number @xmath4 ( ratio between rod velocity and typical speed of sound ) approach zero . in the combined asymptotic limit @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath6 with @xmath7 to which we refer as low - mach - number  slenderness limit , the model equations show two characteristic changes : 1 ) the contact force becomes a variable to a constraint on the kinematics and the respective material law decouples from the model ; 2 ) the angular inertia terms vanish .",
    "the terminology kirchhoff stands for an inextensible and unshearable rod .",
    "classically , the kirchhoff constraint relates the beam tangent and the director triad , it is @xmath8 , see e.g.  @xcite . as consequence of the constraint , the contact force and the strain change their roles in the model system . their proportionality operator is determined by the material law for the contact force",
    ", it can be identified with the moduli of linear elasticity theory .",
    "but in contrast to the linear theory whose validity is restricted to small deformations , large deformations are allowed as the material law can be chosen arbitrarily and the proportionality operator is just its linearization . since namings of different beam models is frequently problematic and inconsistent in literature , we point out that we call the limit model a kirchhoff beam when the system is equipped with the euler - bernoulli relation for the contact couple . in that case",
    "the deduced limit model that has additionally no angular inertia terms is also known as kirchhoff - love equations @xcite .",
    "deriving beam models with different degrees of freedom from the three - dimensional theory of elasticity is topic in several works , see for example the asymptotic limits in @xcite .",
    "the low - mach - number  slenderness asymptotics presented in this paper reveals a direct scaling between the cosserat rod and the kirchhoff beam without angular inertia and complements the previous works .",
    "the result has its analogue in the fluid dynamics where the low - mach - number asymptotics describes the transition from a compressible to an incompressible fluid @xcite . for elastic rods",
    "the speed of sound is not a unique quantity , instead compression and shear waves induce different speeds of sound that imply different mach numbers . for the asymptotic derivation",
    ", it is assumed that there exists a typical magnitude of the contact force .",
    "such a scaling presupposes that the mach numbers associated with compression and shear behave similar .",
    "this corresponds particularly to a constant poisson ratio for a linear isotropic material , as it is often considered in macroscopic applications .",
    "the asymptotic rod behavior is here characterized by the slenderness parameter @xmath3 and the ( typical ) mach number @xmath4 which we relate according to @xmath9 . in the transition regime for small @xmath3 ( @xmath5 )",
    "the type of the model equations changes : time derivatives degenerate , the system becomes stiff with a constraint .",
    "the asymptotic framework reveals a mathematical structure that allows a uniform robust numerical handling of this regime .",
    "we show that the asymptotic systems ( limit system and its first - order correction ) which follow from an even power series expansion are together exact up to order @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the conservation of energy is ensured , if hyper - elastic material laws , external potential forces and appropriate boundary conditions are presupposed . having a newton method for the numerical treatment in mind , solving both asymptotic systems",
    "is of similar computational effort as solving the original @xmath3-dependent system while it is much more accurate and robust in computing the influence of small @xmath3-values .",
    "we point out that the underlying discretization is replaceable . in this paper",
    "we propose an asymptotic - preserving scheme in the spirit of the generalized @xmath0-method that can be switched between energy - conserving and dissipative @xcite .",
    "this is advantageous for applications with external non - potential forces , such as fiber - fluid interactions in non - woven manufacturing @xcite or hair simulations @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for exact energy - momentum conserving algorithms and to @xcite for discrete geometric approaches .",
    "moreover , we refer to the research work in fluid dynamics where the low - mach - number asymptotics has been used to develop and extend numerical schemes for the compressible - incompressible transition regime , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . starting with a brief introduction into the special cosserat rod theory , we present the low - mach - number  slenderness asymptotics in section  [ sec:2 ] . we derive the beam equations of kirchhoff - type for general elastic material laws . to study numerically the performance of the asymptotic framework in the transition regime for small @xmath3",
    ", we consider a two - dimensional euler - bernoulli cantilever beam in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "three variants of the underlying rod model can be distinguished , depending on the chosen kinematic / geometric formulation .",
    "they imply temporal or spatial differential - algebraic systems of different index after semi - discretization in space or time , respectively . in the appendix we provide details to the underlying numerical scheme that is applicable to all formulations in the transition regime .",
    "it is based on a gauss - legendre collocation in space ( finite differences ) and an @xmath0-method in time , but can be also viewed as a conservative finite - volume method .",
    "an elastic thread is a slender long body , i.e.  a rod in three - dimensional continuum mechanics . because of its geometry the dynamics",
    "might be reduced to a one - dimensional description by averaging the underlying balance laws over its cross - sections .",
    "this procedure is based on the assumption that the displacement field in each cross - section can be expressed in terms of a finite number of vector- and tensor - valued quantities .",
    "the special cosserat rod theory @xcite consists of only two constitutive elements in the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath11 , a curve @xmath12 specifying the position and an orthonormal director triad @xmath13 characterizing the orientation of the cross - sections . in @xmath14,\\ , t > 0\\}$ ] ,",
    "the parameter @xmath15 denotes the material cross - section ( material point ) and @xmath16 the time .",
    "the rod system involves four kinematic / geometric and two dynamic equations ( balance laws for linear and angular momentum ) @xmath17 with tangent @xmath18 , generalized curvature @xmath19 , linear velocity @xmath20 and angular velocity @xmath21 .",
    "the mass line density @xmath22 is time - independent for materially closed systems , but modeled as time - dependent for applications , such as evaporation and aggregation .",
    "the tensor - valued moment of inertia of the cross - sections @xmath23 depends on the configuration of the triad and is hence always time - dependent . to close the system of equations we need to specify the external loads @xmath24 and @xmath25 , boundary and initial conditions as well as elastic material laws for the contact force @xmath26 and couple @xmath27 . in this paper",
    "we consider time - independent mass properties of the rod , i.e.  @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and neglect external couples , i.e.  @xmath31 , for reasons of a simple presentation .",
    "however , extensions are straightforward possible . alternatively",
    "to , the rod system can be also set up by using the compatibility relations between the kinematics and geometry for the curve and for the triad .",
    "these two compatibility conditions @xmath32 replace then either the two kinematic equations or the two geometric equations .",
    "[ model : rod]depending on the chosen kinematic / geometric formulation , we distinguish three variants of the rod model :    * kinematic and geometric equations and balance laws ( cf .  ) * kinematic equations , compatibility conditions and balance laws * geometric equations , compatibility conditions and balance laws    throughout the paper we often summarize the three systems in a compact form ( m - t - s ) for readability .",
    "apart from the balance laws , ( m - t - s ) contains then all six kinematic , geometric and compatibility equations together , see for the first time in .",
    "the model variant ( t ) yields a hyperbolic system for a dynamic elastic rod , whereas ( s ) is very suitable for the transition to a stationary consideration .",
    "presupposing hyper - elastic constitutive relations and external potential loads , the variant ( m ) is known as bi - hamiltonian form in literature @xcite .",
    "the choice of the formulation can affect the numerical simulations as we will comment on in section  [ sec:3 ] and the appendix .",
    "however , the distinction plays no role for the asymptotics , thus we make use of the compact notation ( m - t - s ) in the following .    for the objective formulation of the material laws it is useful to rewrite the rod model in the director basis . to an arbitrary vector field @xmath33 , we indicate the coordinate tuples corresponding to the director basis @xmath34 and to a fixed outer cartesian basis @xmath35 by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the director basis can be transformed into the outer basis by the tensor - valued rotation @xmath38 , i.e.  @xmath39 with the associated orthogonal matrix @xmath40 .",
    "for the coordinates , the relation @xmath41 holds  as well as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the rotation matrix @xmath44 can be parametrized , for example , in euler angles or unit quaternions .",
    "moreover , canonical basis vectors in @xmath45 are denoted by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , e.g.  @xmath48 . in the director basis ,",

    "proceeding from the cosserat rod model , we derive beam equations of kirchhoff - type ( a generalized string model ) as the combined slenderness and low - mach - number limits in this subsection .",
