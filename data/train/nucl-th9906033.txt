    "two - particle intensity interferometry ( hbt ) has been used extensively in nucleus - nucleus collisions to measure the space - time extent of the particle emitting region@xcite . because of the complicated dynamics of high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions , the hbt radii , defined as parameters of a gaussian fit to the correlation function , do not measure the full size of the particle emitting region directly . instead",
    ", the hbt radius parameters reflect an interplay between the geometric system size , the expansion of the system , the duration of particle emission , and the contribution of particles from resonance decays .",
    "it is hoped that the two - particle correlation functions can be parameterized in such a way that the various factors that influence the measured hbt radii can be understood individually .",
    "the two - particle correlation function is typically measured as a function of momentum difference @xmath1 and parameterized in term of radius parameters @xmath2 and the so - called haoticity parameter @xmath3 : @xmath4 for a static gaussian pion source , the hbt radius parameters @xmath2 directly correspond to the variance of the particle spatial distribution at freeze - out  @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the particle velocity and @xmath2 are the hbt radius parameters obtained from a fit to the correlation function . for a non - gaussian source , this simple relationship no longer holds . in this paper",
    ", we explore the meaning of the gaussian radius parameters in the case of a non - gaussian particle source and use a dynamical model to investigate the breakdown of equation [ statgauss ] .",
    "note that in general case of the particle source function the relation ( [ statgauss ] ) _ can not _ be true",
    ". a simple example would be the source with added a few particles emitted at very large distances .",
    "the addition of such particles can significantly change the freeze - out distribution r.m.s value and at the same time should not change the correlation function ( sensitive only to pairs with close production points ) .",
    "below we argue that the correlation function , and in particular the hbt radii derived from the gaussian fit to the correlation function are indeed sensitive only to the distribution of close pairs .",
    "hence , they can be quite different from the r.m.s .",
    "values of particle freeze - out distribution .",
    "let us show that the gaussian fit to the correlation function yields the value of @xmath7 where the average is taken over the function @xmath8 . consider a gaussian fit to a one - dimensional correlation function using the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the normalized fit function is @xmath9 the likelihood functional to be minimized is then @xmath10 the likelihood equation becomes , @xmath11 solving this equation yields , @xmath12 hence , irrespective of the shape of the measured correlation function , the fitted gaussian hbt radii measure the value of @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath13 can also be related to the shape of the source function ( time integrated relative distance distribution ) @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the distance between particle production points @xmath16 . using this function ,",
    "the correlation function in momentum space can be fourier transformed into position space@xcite : @xmath17 differentiating the source function twice yields , @xmath18 where the average is taken over the correlation function , @xmath19 .",
    "[ eqn : fitr ] and [ eqn : deltas ] show that the hbt radius parameters are directly related to the second derivative of the source function of relative production points near @xmath20 .",
    "this is true irregardless of the shape of the correlation function .",
    "note that the lambda parameter in the fit function ( eq . [ ec2 ] ) in a maximum likelihood approach is defined by the normalization @xmath21 the r.h.s . of this expression",
    "can be determined from equation [ eqn : s ] : @xmath22 it follows then that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ( true ) source function at the origin , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the ( fitted ) radius parameters .",
    "to understand the relationship between the fitted hbt radii and the source function of relative production points and check how well the above equations work for a realistic particle source , the event generator rqmd ( v2.4 ) @xcite is employed .",
    "this model has been shown to reproduce experimental hbt data reasonably well @xcite .",
    "we focus on particle production in midrapidity region @xmath28 ) in central ( @xmath29fm ) au+au collisions at rhic energy ( @xmath30  gev / nucleon ) .",
    "figure [ freezeout ] shows single particle freeze - out position distribution and the two - particle relative position distribution for pions .",
    "the single particle freeze - out position difference distribution has long non - gaussian tails .",
    "in addition , the shape is not well described by a gaussian at @xmath31 .",
    "the two - particle position difference distribution still shows large non - gaussian tails .",
    "the distribution , however , is well described as a gaussian near @xmath32 .",
    "fitting this distribution to a gaussian ( also shown in the figure ) yields a gaussian width @xmath33 that is substantially smaller than the r.m.s .",
    "deviation of the distribution .",
    "the two - particle correlation functions are calculated as a function of @xmath34 for mid - rapidity ( @xmath35 ) pions and kaons assuming plane wave propagation for the outgoing particles . the three - dimensional correlation function",
    "is then fit using the bertsch - pratt out - side - long parameterization , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the momentum difference along the beam axis , @xmath38 is the momentum difference perpendicular to the beam axis and parallel to the total transverse momentum of the pair , and @xmath39 is the momentum difference perpendicular to the beam axis and perpendicular to the total transverse momentum of the pair .",
    "figure [ rvspt ] shows the fitted hbt radius parameters as a function of transverse momentum .",
    "also plotted are the r.m.s .",
    "deviations of the single particle freeze - out distributions and the fitted gaussian widths of the two - particle position difference distributions . the r.m.s .",
    "deviations are substantially larger than the fitted hbt radii in all cases , while the fitted gaussian widths of the two - particle relative position difference distributions are very close to the fitted hbt radii .",
    "the single - particle r.m.s .",
    "deviation differs from the fitted hbt radii most at low transverse momentum .",
    "this deviation arises from the long non - gaussian tails in the freeze - out position distribution due to pions from resonance decay and particular expansion dynamics of the system .    the width parameter ( sigma ) of the gaussian fit to the two - particle difference distribution near the origin ( in our calculations we perform the fit in the region of @xmath40  r.m.s . ) is a very good estimate of the second derivative of the relative source function at @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the observed good agreement between hbt radii ( fit parameters to the correlation function ) and widths of the gaussians fitted to the two - particle position difference distribution near the origin confirm relationship shown in eqns .",
    "[ eqn : fitr ] and [ eqn : deltas ] .",
    "note a simple interpretation of the lambda parameter following from fig .  1 ( two - particle position difference distributions ) .",
    "it is just a product of the ratios of area under the gaussian fit and the total number of pairs used for the distribution .",
    "figure [ rvsptk ] is similar to figure [ rvspt ] except that the particles used are kaons . in this case , the r.m.s .",
    "deviations of the single - particle freeze - out distributions and the fitted gaussian width of the two - particle relative distance distribution are very similar in the transverse directions . since fewer kaons come from resonance decays , the long non - gaussian tails in the single particle freeze - out distributions are greatly reduced . in the longitudinal direction , where the non - gaussian nature of the production point distribution is mostly defined by the system expansion dynamics ( very similar for pions and kaons ) , the difference between the hbt radii and the r.m.s .",
    "values of freeze - out distribution is quite significant .",
    "the lambda parameter in the kaon case is generally larger than that for the pion case but due to a limited statistics exhibits large fluctuations and is omitted from the figure .",
    "we have shown that the hbt radius parameters obtained from a gaussian fit to the correlation function are equivalent to the the curvature of the relative freeze - out distributions at @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the fitted hbt radii are directly related to fitted gaussian width of the two - particle position difference distribution near the origin .",
    "the lambda parameter is determined by the ratio of the value of the real relative distance distribution at the origin and the distribution chosen in a gaussian form with the radii parameters determined by the fit to the shape of the correlation function .",
    "studies with a dynamical model support the above statements .",
