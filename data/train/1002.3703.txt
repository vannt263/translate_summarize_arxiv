    "in the past decade there has been a lot of interest in the study of extra dimensions , in particular the scenario where our apparent universe lives in a three - dimensional hypersurface , a 3-_brane _ , embedded in a space with more dimensions ( for a review see ref .",
    "this is the so - called _ braneworld _ picture , which brings new possibilities and perspectives to cosmology . in this work",
    "we will consider the simplest case of a braneworld scenario , where there is only one extra dimension , and analyze the impact of this modification in the attempt of getting quintessential inflation @xcite .",
    "our framework is of kaluza  klein type , but where , instead of compactifying the extra dimension , one assumes that matter fields are confined to the brane and that gravity is allowed to act in the five - dimensional embedding space , generally called the _",
    "bulk_. we adopt the simplest such set - up , known as randall  sundrum type ii @xcite . by solving the einstein equations in the vicinity of the brane ,",
    "one finds a modified friedmann equation that determines the cosmological evolution caused by fields confined to our 3-brane , such as a scalar field @xcite . in this case , the inclusion of an extra dimension in the theory introduces an extra friction term in the high - energy limit , which allows inflation to occur with much steeper potentials than usual @xcite .",
    "this is favourable to get a second inflation today out of the same scalar field , _ i.e. _  a quintessence , from the behaviour that such potentials have at late times .    at lower energies ,",
    "the braneworld - induced friction term is negligible and the scalar field spends a period completely dominated by its kinetic energy . in this era , usually called _ kination _ , the field density decreases very rapidly , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scale factor , permitting unusual reheating processes .",
    "the examples that will be explored later are reheating by gravitational particle production @xcite , where radiation - like particles created during inflation can come to dominate the universe during kination , and curvaton reheating where energy density is stored in a second scalar field to be later released by its decay .",
    "the existence of a kination together with the possibility of having steep potentials makes this scenario appealing for the implementation of quintessential inflation @xcite . with a suitable choice of scalar field potential and reheating process",
    "one can try to fit observational data from inflation , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and quintessence .",
    "there have been several studies of such models @xcite , but none of them satisfy all the constraints brought by contemporary data . in this present work ,",
    "we make a thorough review as well as expanding the space of models to fully understand to what extent it is possible to get inflation and quintessence out of the same scalar field in this simplified view of the braneworld paradigm .",
    "we will see that for the potentials analyzed , quintessential inflation can not be achieved .    in this paper ,",
    "we discuss potentials with a simple structure , making only brief comments in section iv on more complex ones , _ i.e. _ potentials that combine different forms at early and late times ( for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . of course , we want potentials with good late - time behaviours and , as will be shown , the exponential and inverse power - law types are in that class . therefore these are the two potentials analyzed by us in detail .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we specify the models that we will test , presenting separately what is happening at early and late times . in section iii",
    "we impose constraints on these models based on their viability in comparison with observations .",
    "again , the analyses of the constraints for the inflation period and late - time quintessence are treated independently . in section",
    "iv we combine the constraints from both periods , to study the viability of quintessential inflation .",
    "finally , in section v we summarize the main results we obtained .",

    "the friedmann equation then takes the simple form @xmath2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second term will give an extra friction to the scalar - field evolution . the scalar field",
    "@xmath7 that we will consider to give rise to inflation and quintessence is confined to the brane , following the standard evolution : @xmath8      the simplest model of this class , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , generates inflation with an exponential potential of the general form : to be smaller by a factor @xmath9 , by using the reduced planck mass in the definition . ]",
    "@xmath10 here @xmath11 is taken to be greater than @xmath12 , a regime in which the potential is too steep to sustain inflation in einstein gravity . in the high - energy limit , with @xmath13",
    ", the stronger friction term ensures that inflation can occur . during inflation , due to quantum fluctuations",
    ", radiation - like particles are created , in the generally - called gravitational particle production process @xcite . at a low - energy limit ,",
    "when @xmath14 becomes smaller than @xmath6 , the extra term of the friedmann equation becomes unimportant and the field starts evolving as standard in a steep potential .",
    "inflation ends and the field , experiencing such a steep potential , becomes dominated by its kinetic energy . during this kination ,",
    "the effect of the potential is negligible and the energy density of the field decreases very rapidly as @xmath0 .",
    "this abrupt loss of energy allows the gravitationally - produced radiation to dominate before bbn .",
    "this reheats the universe without requiring our scalar field to decay .",
    "the predictions of this model for the inflationary parameters @xmath15 , the spectral index of scalar perturbations , and @xmath16 , the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations , can be easily obtained using the modified slow - roll parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , and have the simple form @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of e - foldings .",
    "it has been shown that in this case @xmath18 can be unambiguously calculated to be 70 @xcite .",
    "this results in the values @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which in combination are clearly excluded by current observations @xcite .",
    "this is one of the problems of this model .",
    "another is related to a relic gravitational waves imprint .",
    "gravitational waves can be treated as a massless radiation field that decays as @xmath21 when it is in the subhorizon regime .",
    "short - scale gravitational waves , created by the same gravitational production mechanism , enter the subhorizon regime right after inflation , during the kinetic regime where the dominating background evolves as @xmath0 .",
    "this means that these gravitational waves will have a boost in their relative energy density @xmath22 .",
    "such a behaviour leaves an imprint that destroys bbn , excluding the model @xcite .    a solution to both these problems can come from the choice of another type of reheating , which brings the values of @xmath23 and @xmath16 down as well as limiting the duration of the dominating kinetic period .",
    "this can be achieved with the inclusion of a curvaton field @xcite whose decays reheat the universe @xcite .",
    "the curvaton is another field which coexists with the inflaton , that is subdominant and massless during inflation , and which can be responsible for the primordial curvature perturbations . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider that this field has a quadratic potential of the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of the curvaton . to ensure this is effectively massless during inflation we impose the condition @xmath26 , the hubble parameter at the end of inflation . under these conditions ,",
    "the value of the curvaton field , @xmath27 , remains constant during inflation @xcite , apart from acquiring quantum - originated fluctuations from the expanding background .",
    "if we choose @xmath25 correctly , during the kinetic period the field becomes effectively massive , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath28 .",
    "this should happen at an early time to avoid the short - scale gravitational waves problem .",
    "the field then starts to oscillate , which corresponds to behaviour as matter , and its energy density falls as @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "it then becomes dominant quite rapidly .",
    "the choice of @xmath25 and of @xmath30 , the value of the field at the start of inflation , needs to be made in such a way that inflation and bbn can occur successfully .",
    "these constraints will be analyzed in detail in section iii.a .",
    "we will assume that the curvaton decays into radiation by some process with decay rate @xmath31 , when @xmath32 .",
    "the field could start its decay while the kinetically - driven inflaton is still dominating , which can bring some calculational complications @xcite . in this work , for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the curvaton only starts decaying after being dominant .",
    "how are primordial perturbations created in this scenario ? during inflation , the curvaton experiences quantum fluctuations , like the inflaton .",
    "these fluctuations of @xmath27 freeze at horizon crossing and have a spectrum @xmath33 where the star subscript denotes horizon crossing @xcite .",
    "then , after inflation , when the curvaton becomes massive and oscillating , these fluctuations are converted into scalar curvature perturbations .",
    "the spectrum of these curvature perturbations has the form @xcite @xmath34 the scale dependence of @xmath35 is the same as that of @xmath36 , and so the spectral index has the simple form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the slow - roll parameter .",
    "this matches the spectral index of primordial tensors and is usually different from that of the inflaton - induced perturbations .    the parameter @xmath16 ( we follow the convention as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spectrum of tensor perturbations , also suffers alterations .",
    "tensor perturbations in the metric are produced during inflation ; they have the general form of @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a braneworld correction that in the high - energy limit takes the form @xmath43    in general , the scalar curvature perturbations @xmath35 should be a sum of the perturbation of the inflaton and curvaton . in our case , we are assuming that the curvaton perturbations are dominant , so @xmath16 has the form @xmath44 in section iii.a , where constraints are applied to the values of @xmath27 and @xmath25 , we will show how possible is the inclusion of a successful curvaton to the model , and if so how efficient it is in matching the wmap observations .",
    "+ the other simple potential that we analyzed in our study is the inverse power law : @xmath45 this potential allows an arbitrary amount of early - universe inflation for any @xmath46 , as can be seen by the modified expression for the number of @xmath47-foldings in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "just as in the case of the exponential potential , we could seek a good model by reheating the universe with gravitational particle production .",
    "but the kinetic dominated period would still be too long , so the short - scale gravitational waves would remain a problem .     and @xmath16 with observations from wmap five - year data , for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "the exponential potential would lie under the @xmath48 point .",
    "the plot shows the @xmath49 and @xmath50 confidence limits .",
    "the outer limits correspond to wmap data alone , and the inner to wmap data combined with supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillation data .",
    "we can clearly see that this model is excluded by observations .",
    "adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "further , again using the modified slow - roll parameters @xcite , we can calculate @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath51 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ wmapinvnoc ] , these values are again excluded by wmap .",
    "so , as in the case of the exponential potential , to try to get a successful inflation , we need to include a curvaton in the model . in section iii.a we will show constraints on @xmath52 and @xmath25 for this specific potential , to try to understand if a curvaton can in fact help the creation of inflation with good observational fit .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we sought to create a model that could give rise to successful inflation .",
    "now it is necessary to check if these models can give rise to quintessence , and if so , under which conditions .",
    "to do so , we need to analyze the late - time behaviours of the potentials studied .",
    "kination wo nt last forever .",
    "the strong decrease of the energy density makes the kinetic energy decrease to a point where the potential is no longer negligible .",
    "the behaviours of such scalar fields that have been subdominant for a certain period of time is well known @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting solutions when @xmath53 have the general name of scaling and tracking solutions , since in these cases the scalar field will ` follow ' the evolution of the dominating background fluid .",
    "these two types of solution differ in the way the scalar field evolves .",
    "if we consider that the background fluid evolves as @xmath54 and that the scalar field evolves as @xmath55 , scaling solutions will be the ones where @xmath56 and tracking the ones where @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that such evolution is interesting , especially if we could get the scalar field tracking radiation and matter and only start dominating today . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the only potentials that give rise to the above tracking behaviours are exponentials , inverse power laws and some positive power laws , although the last option is not interesting for connecting with inflation .",
    "furthermore , it was also shown that these solutions are attractors .",
    "scalar fields with exponential potentials have scaling solutions at late times , with @xmath56 . since the ratio between dominant fluid and scalar field is always a constant ,",
    "there is no possibility for late - time quintessence if we are in the scaling regime .",
    "scalar fields with inverse power laws have tracking solutions where @xmath58 .",
    "this means that the scalar field energy density is increasing with time compared to the one of the dominant fluid .",
    "this is exactly the right condition to try to get quintessence .",
    "when the scalar field density approaches the one of the background fluid , the assumption that @xmath53 breaks down , and the field starts dominating , until its density is @xmath59 and its equation of state is @xmath60 . in section",
    "iii.b we will analyze whether , beside being able to produce acceleration at late times , this model can also satisfy the constraints on such acceleration today , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xcite . + an alternative regime occurs when the scalar field kination period lasts for so long that the field overshoots its tracking solution and then freezes due to redshifting of the kinetic term , later approaching that solution from below .",
    "if the overshoot is so great that the field only approaches the tracking solution around the epoch where tracking solution would be coming to dominate the fluid , we can enter directly into quintessence domination without a tracking period .",
    "this regime is referred to as creeping or thawing @xcite quintessence , and was first explored in our present context in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the energy density is initially approximately constant in this circumstance and the field behaves as a cosmological constant with @xmath60 .",
    "when the energy density of the scalar field gets close enough to the background energy density , the field begins to evolve to @xmath63 .    with an inverse power - law ,",
    "once thawing acceleration begins it will typically persevere .",
    "by contrast , the late - time solution for a steep exponential potential is a non - accelerating scaling solution , and in that case the field can only temporarily drive acceleration @xcite .    in section",
    "iii.b the above possibilities will be explored to see how well they can reproduce today s conditions on quintessence .",
    "in this subsection we present the constraints that need to be imposed on the scalar field plus curvaton scenario , so that inflation occurs in a successful way .",
    "in fact , this will correspond to constraints on the space of values allowed for @xmath52 and @xmath25 , leaving as free parameters only @xmath18 , the number of @xmath47-foldings , and @xmath11 , the potential parameter .    before presenting the constraints ,",
    "let us consider some useful relations . in the high - energy limit , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 refer to the beginning and end of inflation , can be expressed as a function of @xmath18 , by using the modified expression for @xmath18 given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for exponential potentials : @xmath68 and for inverse power - law potentials : @xmath69    using the modified expression for the slow - roll parameter @xmath38 , and setting it to unity , we can get an expression for @xmath70 . for exponential potentials",
    "we obtain @xmath71 and for inverse power - law potentials : @xmath72    we do nt so far know the value of @xmath73 that shows up in this expression . to obtain it , we performed a numerical calculation of the equations of motion of the system during inflation . as a result",

    "now we present the five conditions that must be satisfied for successful inflation : + 1 .",
    "the curvaton needs to be subdominant when it becomes massive , to avoid a curvaton - driven inflation .",
    "this condition is expressed as : @xmath77 where the subscript @xmath78 refers to the period when the curvaton becomes massive . during kination",
    ", the hubble parameter evolves as @xmath79 , so @xmath80 and the friedmann equation can be simplified to @xmath81 we can then work out condition ( [ condition1basic ] ) : @xmath82 where we use @xmath83 to refer to the beginning of kination .",
    "the condition is then simply : @xmath84    \\2 .",
    "the curvaton needs to be subdominant at the end of inflation as well , to avoid a curvaton - driven inflation .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath85    \\3 .",
    "the decay of the curvaton needs to occur before nucleosynthesis , so that this is successful , and after curvaton domination .",
    "we have the conditions : @xmath86 where the subscript ` ( eq ) ' refers to the curvaton  scalar field equivalence epoch",
    ". we can write @xmath87 which is equivalent to having @xmath88 so condition ( [ condition3basic ] ) is just @xmath89    \\4 .",
    "inflation perturbations can not be important since we wish to get perturbations entirely from the curvaton . without the presence of the curvaton",
    ", we could estimate the value of @xmath90 from the cobe normalization of the density perturbations originated by inflation . to guarantee that curvaton - induced perturbations are much bigger than the ones originated by the inflaton",
    ", we just need to ensure that @xmath91    \\5 .",
    "the last condition that needs to be imposed is that short - scale gravitational waves are within limits .",
    "we can express this as @xmath92 using the expression for the evolution of energy density of gravitational waves during the kinetic period from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath93 plus the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves , eq .",
    "( [ hgw ] ) which can be rewritten as @xmath94 we can estimate our condition .",
    "+         now , we want to evaluate these conditions for our two potentials .",
    "conditions 1 and 3 are the same , as they do nt depend on the shape of the potential .    for exponential scalar field potentials , using expressions ( [ viveexp ] ) and ( [ vendexp ] ) , condition 2 can be worked out as follows : @xmath95 so , we can write down the expression as @xmath96 where @xmath35 is the observationally - known spectrum of the bardeen potential , which has the value of @xmath97 at the horizon scale .    in condition 4 , we need to insert the value that @xmath6 would take if there was no curvaton in the model .",

    "figure [ thawvstrack ] shows two examples for the field thawing and finding its tracking solution before domination , respectively .    .",
    "we see that the field is initially frozen and starts evolving until domination .",
    "this model is in good agreement with observations . in the lower plot , @xmath133 .",

    ", there is a disagreement with observations . in both plots , @xmath134.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for very large @xmath11 , as expected , the field never manages to dominate at late times .",
    "we already knew that once the field finds its tracking solution , the model fails .",
    "we conclude , then , that for our conditions at the end of inflation , only for very particular cases of very small @xmath11 and @xmath127 are the observational constraints of quintessence satisfied .",
    "now we need to check if these constraints are in agreement with the ones from inflation .",
    "a satisfactory quintessence , as a manifestation of the inflaton at late times , is only achieved , as mentioned , for inverse power law potentials with @xmath135 with low values of @xmath127 ( though bigger than 1 ) .",
    "but for the full model to work , these constraints must be in agreement with inflation itself .",
    "when we fix @xmath127 in the calculation , since @xmath110 is an output value , we are fixing @xmath6 .",
    "there are two tests we can do to check if inflation works successfully in the cases where quintessence does .",
    "first we can substitute the output @xmath110 in the conditions for inflation and create a plot as in figs .",
    "[ exp ] and [ inv ] to see if there is still a region of suitable parameters .",
    "if there is , the second test we can make is to substitute the value of @xmath6 in expression ( [ lambdainv ] ) and see if the value of @xmath52 lays in such a region .    in our case",
    ", @xmath110 is of the order of @xmath136 for all the possible @xmath11 s .",
    "this is a very low value .",
    "it implies that inflation would end at an energy scale of @xmath136 , which is much lower than the energy scale for nucleosynthesis .",
    "this incompatibility is clear in our plot of the parameter space .",
    "figure [ fail ] shows how by implementing the real value of @xmath110 for @xmath137 , the parameter space disappears .",
    "this fact is even more drastic for smaller values of @xmath11 .     and @xmath138 .",
    "we see that there is no possibility of successful inflation ( the allowed parameter space is to the left of the dash - dotted / green line , above the dashed / cyan line and below the dotted / red line ) . for smaller values of @xmath11",
    "the discrepancy increases . ]",
    "hence we conclude that we can not get quintessential inflation for the potentials studied .",
    "this is our main conclusion .",
    "now , we can discuss how this result would change for other potentials . in this paper",
    ", we chose to study the simplest potentials that have interesting late - time behaviours .",
    "more complex potentials with more freedom of parameters , when picked correctly , can be set to fit observations . in particular , if the potential is composed of two different regimes at early and late times , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is always possible to fit the observations , just by choosing good potentials and by setting exactly where the late - time behaviour should start . since our objective was to try to motivate the value of @xmath114 today by the conditions of the universe at the end of inflation , such models are nt in the scope of our analysis .    to end our discussion ,",
    "although quintessential inflation is impossible to achieve in our framework , we want to highlight the fact that it is still possible to get inflation .",
    "in such a case , for both potentials , the system would have to have a curvaton to give rise to the density perturbations and satisfy the constraints shown in figs .",
    "[ exp ] and [ inv ] .",
    "additionally , to prevent it coming to redominate too early , the inflaton would have to decay completely through some sort of reheating process , for instance a hybrid inflation mechanism , leading to considerable further modelling complications . in this case , another explanation of the dark energy would need to be sought .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive series of models seeking to uncover the possibility of combining early universe inflation and present - day quintessence into a single field with a simple potential .",
    "such a model would give obvious benefits in simplifying the structure of the cosmological model , but must face much stronger observational challenges than models where separate components are responsible for each accelerated period .",
    "the range of models we have discussed is quite extensive .",
    "having adopted the braneworld in order to have a natural end to inflation which does not require a feature in the potential , we then considered two substantially different reheating mechanisms  gravitational particle production and curvaton reheating  as well as two different regimes of quintessence , tracking and thawing . in practice , gravitational particle production fails both to match the primordial spectra measured by wmap and to give success nucleosynthesis due to excessive short - scale gravitational waves , forcing us to the curvaton case .",
    "likewise , the conditions that inflation enforces on the potential immediately rule out the tracking models , as either the field fails to dominate at all at late times , or does so with an equation of state too far from @xmath139 .",
    "we are thus forced to the thawing regime , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "it is then possible to find models capable of satisfying either the inflationary part of the picture , or the quintessence part .",
    "sadly , however , we have found no models capable of satisfying both , the combined observational constraints being failed by a large margin .    given the comprehensiveness of the models we have considered , we feel that current observations leave no room for quintessential inflation from simple potentials , with models assembled from the various known mechanisms of inflation , reheating , and quintessence .",
    "quintessential inflation does , of course , remain possible provided one manipulates the potential into just the required shape to bring the different regimes together , as in the original proposal of peebles and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "to do so does not however appear any more attractive than maintaining two separate sectors , nor does it seem amenable to future observational tests ."
