    "we stress that no continuity assumption is made .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath10 ensures that there is no `` local drift '' for the gradient of the field ( remarkably , no such assumption on @xmath11 is necessary ; see also remark  [ th : remarkable ] below ) .",
    "we point out that the hypothesis that both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are finite everywhere could be relaxed , allowing them to take the value @xmath37 outside some interval @xmath38 , but we stick for simplicity to the above stated assumptions .",
    "the model @xmath12 is an example of a _ random polymer model _ , more precisely a ( homogeneous ) _ pinning model_. a lot of attention has been devoted to this class of models in the recent mathematical literature ( see  @xcite for two beautiful monographs ) .",
    "the main question , for models like ours , is whether the pinning reward @xmath1 is strong enough to localize the field at the defect line for large @xmath15 .",
    "the case when the self - interaction of the field is of purely gradient type , i.e. , when @xmath39 in , has been studied in depth @xcite , as well as the purely laplacian case when @xmath40 , cf .",
    "we now consider the mixed case when both @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which is especially interesting from a physical viewpoint , because of its direct relevance in modeling _ semiflexible polymers _ , cf .",
    "intuitively , the gradient interaction penalizes large elongations of the chain while the laplacian interaction penalizes curvature and bendings .",
    "the standard way to capture the localization properties of models like ours is to look at the exponential rate of growth ( laplace asymptotic behavior ) as @xmath43 of the partition function @xmath25 .",
    "more precisely , we define the _ free energy _ @xmath44 of our model as @xmath45 where the limit is easily shown to exist by a standard super - additivity argument  @xcite .    the function @xmath46 is non - decreasing for fixed @xmath15 ( cf . ) , hence @xmath47 is non - decreasing too . recalling that @xmath48",

    "this seemingly mysterious definition of localization and delocalization does correspond to sharply different behaviors of the typical trajectories of our model .",
    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath54 the number of contacts between the linear chain and the defect line , it is easily shown by convexity arguments that    * if @xmath55 , for every @xmath56 there exists @xmath57 such that @xmath58 * if @xmath59 , there exists @xmath60 and @xmath61 such that @xmath62    in words : if the model is delocalized then typically @xmath63 , while if the model is localized then typically @xmath64 with @xmath60 .",
    "we refer , e.g. , to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  a ) for the proof of these facts .",
    "we point out that the behavior of the model at the critical point is a much more delicate issue , which is linked to the regularity of the free energy .    coming back to the critical value",
    ", it is quite easy to show that @xmath65 ( it is a by - product of our main result ) , that is , the localized regime is non - empty .",
    "however , it is not _ a priori _ clear whether @xmath3 , i.e. whether the delocalized regime is non - empty .",
    "for instance , in the purely laplacian case ( @xmath40 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , one has @xmath66 . on the other hand , in the purely gradient case ( @xmath39 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) one has @xmath67 and the model is said to undergo a _",
    "trivial phase transition _ : an arbitrarily small pinning reward is able to localize the linear chain .    the main result of this note is that in the general case of mixed gradient and laplacian interaction the phase transition is always trivial .    [ theorem ] for any choice of the potentials @xmath10 , @xmath11 satisfying assumptions [ c1 ] and [ c2 ] one has @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath68 for every @xmath4 .    generally speaking , it may be expected that the gradient interaction terms should dominate over the laplacian ones , at least when @xmath10 and @xmath11 are comparable functions .",
    "therefore , having just recalled that @xmath67 , theorem  [ theorem ] does not come as a surprise .",
    "nevertheless , our assumptions [ c1 ] and [ c2 ] are very general and allow for strikingly different asymptotic behavior of the potentials : for instance , one could choose @xmath10 to grow only logarithmically and @xmath11 exponentially fast ( or even more ) .",
    "the fact that the gradient interaction dominates even in such extreme cases is quite remarkable .",
    "our proof yields actually an explicit lower bound on the free energy , which is however quite poor .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in remark  [ th : improving ] in section  [ sec : lb ] below .",

    "thesis @xcite in the special case when both the interaction potentials are quadratic : @xmath69 and @xmath70 , for any @xmath71 .",
    "we point out that , with such a choice for the potentials , the free model @xmath72 is a gaussian law and several explicit computations are possible .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of the theorem  [ theorem ] , which is organized in two parts :    * in section  [ sec : markov ] we give a basic representation of the free model ( @xmath73 ) as the bridge of an integrated markov chain , and we study some asymptotic properties of this hidden markov chain ; * in section  [ sec : lb ] we give an explicit lower bound on the partition function @xmath74 which , together with the estimates obtained in section  [ sec : markov ] , yields the positivity of the free energy @xmath44 for every @xmath4 , hence the proof of theorem  [ theorem ] .",

    "this is possible , but only to a certain extent : even the conjectured sharp lower bound @xmath305 ( in analogy with the purely gradient case ) would yield only @xmath306 .",
