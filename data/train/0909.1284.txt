    "the reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) method is commonly used to build structure models based on experimental data . introduced by mcgreevy and pusztai in 1988,@xcite it has been spreading fast and is now considered a standard method in analyzing structural data .",
    "advantages of this method are its easy implementation and its wide applicability .",
    "it has been used to model various material systems such as crystals , polymers and glasses . in principal any structural data can be used as input for the rmc method , but most modelings focus on using diffraction data obtained from x - ray and/or neutron scattering . in ion conducting glass systems rmc models of the structure of the structure have been created for @xmath1li@xmath0s+@xmath2 sio@xmath0 glasses,@xcite 0.7sio@xmath0 + 0.3na@xmath0o glass,@xcite @xmath1na@xmath0s+@xmath2b@xmath0s@xmath3 glasses@xcite and 0.5li@xmath0s+0.5[@xmath4ges@xmath0+@xmath1geo@xmath0 ]",
    "glasses@xcite among others .",
    "as pointed out by mcgreevy , rmc models are  neither unique nor correct  , but can aid our understanding of local structure properties and their relation to other physical properties.@xcite accordingly it is important to qualify rmc models for different material classes and to get insight into the limits of this method .",
    "this is becoming a more urgent question now , since in recent rmc studies not only the short range order of various network glasses has been investigated , but also the medium range order . among those studies are discussions of the rings sizes in vitreous sio@xmath0 and geo@xmath0,@xcite a detailed investigations of amorphous gese@xmath0,@xcite and a proposal of a structural model for multi - component borosilicate glasses , where partial segregation of silicon and boron rich regions is predicted.@xcite it was also suggested to use such models as basis for further investigation of possible conduction pathways of the mobile ions . in this respect",
    "the rmc models have been employed in connection with geometric constraints and the bond valence ( bv ) analysis@xcite ( see ref . for a critical discussion of this procedure ) .    in this paper",
    "we test the rmc method against structural data obtained from a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of a li@xmath0o - sio@xmath0 glass . for this purpose",
    "we calculate surrogate diffraction data from the simulated md structures and these surrogate data are used as input for the rmc modeling . for the evaluation of the resulting rmc models we determine how well various properties of the original md structure are reproduced .",
    "particularly we compare properties such as partial radial distribution functions and ring - size distributions , which are not easily accessible by experiment . through our evaluation",
    "it can be clarified how far one can use the rmc method to gain insight into these properties , and where one has to be cautious to take features of the rmc model for real .    we want to stress that for the testing to be valid , it is not necessary that the md simulation is a particularly good representation of the real lithium silicate glass .",
    "rather , the md structure can be seen as a valid glass system in itself .",
    "we will show that the rmc models generally compare well with the md structure , but that one has to take care when analyzing features of the medium - range order regime .",
    "we perform md simulations of a lithium silicate glass with the chemical formula li@xmath0o - sio@xmath0 using the potential model of j.  habasaki and i.  okada.@xcite the cubic simulation box has a length @xmath6   and contains 11664 atoms ( 3888 li , 1944 si , 5832 o ) corresponding to a density of @xmath7  g/@xmath8 and a number density of @xmath9  @xmath10 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "the simulations are performed in the nve ensemble ( micro canonical ensemble where the number @xmath11 of particles , the volume @xmath12 of the simulation box , and the total energy @xmath13 are kept constant ) .",
    "the energy @xmath13 was adjusted so that the temperature of the system fluctuates around a mean value of 301  k with deviations of 2  k. the systems are equilibrated for about 1  ns and the runs for obtaining data have a duration of 2  ns , using a time step interval of @xmath14  fs .",

    "the interaction potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uij ] ) is composed of three terms .",
    "the first one in ( [ eq : uij ] ) is the coulomb interaction with effective charge numbers for the species .",
    "the second term is a born - meyer type potential , which takes the short - range repulsive interactions into account , and the third is a dispersive van - der - waals interaction .",

    "the size of the ring is equal to the number of its si - atoms .",
    "the maximum number of rings equals the total number of si - atoms .",
    "however the number of rings is generally smaller , since there are a number of si - atoms for which no ring is found ( e.  g. , for an isolated sio@xmath46 tetrahedra ) , and two different si - atoms can be associated with the same ring .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rings ] the ring - size distributions of the md system , the rmc - nc and the rmc - nr - model are shown .",
    "no data is shown for the x - ray and combined data based rmc models , since their ring - size distributions are practically the same as for the neutron diffraction data based rmc models .",
    "indeed the ring - size distributions almost do not change compared to those of the initial models . on the other hand",

    "the rmc - nc model has a high number of rings of a size larger than 10 .",
    "examining these large rings in more detail reveals that most of them are actually straight linear chains penetrating the system parallel to one system axis ( they are seen as rings due to the periodic boundary conditions , and can be found in both the rmc - nc and the rmc - xc models ; see also fig .",

    "nearest neighbor distances the rmc models are less predictive and therefore can not be expected to capture the medium range order properly .    comparing rmc models",
    "based on x - ray and neutron scattering data revealed no significant differences .",
    "moreover , we found that the additional consideration of scattering data from one type of probe ( either x - ray or neutron ) gives only a modest improvement over the initial rmc models that are based on geometric constraints only ( number density , minimal pair distances , some coordination numbers ) .",

    "most structural properties of the rmc models do not depend sensitively on the starting configuration ( crystalline or random ) .",
    "even the ring - size distributions do not differ that much .",
