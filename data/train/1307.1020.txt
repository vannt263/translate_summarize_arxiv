    "in @xcite we initiated a systematic study of multiple cluster structures in the rings of regular functions on simple lie groups following an approach developed and implemented in @xcite for constructing cluster structures on algebraic varieties .",
    "it is based on the notion of a poisson bracket compatible with a cluster structure .",
    "the key point is that if an algebraic poisson variety @xmath4 possesses a coordinate chart that consists of regular functions whose logarithms have pairwise constant poisson brackets , then one can try to use this chart to define a cluster structure @xmath5 compatible with @xmath6 .",
    "algebraic structures corresponding to @xmath5 ( the cluster algebra and the upper cluster algebra ) are closely related to the ring @xmath7 of regular functions on @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , under certain rather mild conditions , @xmath7 can be obtained by tensoring one of these algebras by @xmath9 .",
    "this construction was applied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.3 ) to double bruhat cells in semisimple lie groups equipped with ( the restriction of ) the _ standard _ poisson  lie structure .",
    "it was shown that the resulting cluster structure coincides with the one built in @xcite .",
    "recall that it was proved in @xcite that the corresponding upper cluster algebra is isomorphic to the ring of regular functions on the double bruhat cell . since the open double bruhat cell is dense in the corresponding lie group",
    ", one can equip the ring of regular functions on the lie group with the same cluster structure .",
    "the standard poisson  lie structure is a particular case of poisson  lie structures corresponding to quasi - triangular lie bialgebras .",
    "such structures are associated with solutions to the classical yang ",
    "baxter equation ( cybe ) .",
    "their complete classification was obtained by belavin and drinfeld in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we conjectured that any such solution gives rise to a compatible cluster structure on the lie group and provided several examples supporting this conjecture by showing that it holds true for the class of the standard poisson  lie structure in any simple complex lie group , and for the whole belavin ",
    "drinfeld classification in @xmath2 for @xmath10 .",
    "we call the cluster structures associated with the non - trivial belavin  drinfeld data",
    "_ exotic_.    in this paper , we prove the conjecture of @xcite in the case of the cremmer  gervais poisson structure on @xmath2 .",
    "we chose to consider this case because , in a sense , the poisson structure in question differs the most from the standard : the discrete data featured in the belavin  drinfeld classification is trivial in the standard case and has the `` maximal size '' in the cremmer ",
    "gervais case .",
    "our result allows to equip @xmath2 , @xmath11 and the affine space @xmath12 of @xmath13 matrices with a new cluster structure , @xmath14 . in section 2 below",
    ", we collect the necessary information on cluster algebras and poisson  lie groups and formulate the main conjecture from @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we present the definition of the cremmer ",
    "gervais poisson bracket , formulate our main result , introduce the cluster structure @xmath14 and outline the proof of the main theorem by breaking it into a series of intermediate results about @xmath14 and showing how the final part of the proof  the fact that the ring of regular functions is contained in the upper cluster algebra associated with @xmath14  follows from them .",
    "the first result we need is the existence of a log - canonical coordinate system on @xmath11 with respect to the natural extension of the cremmer - gervais poisson structure .",
    "the proof is contained in section 4 as a corollary of a more general claim : using an embedding of @xmath11 into its double as a diagonal subgroup , we prove that a certain family of functions is log - canonical on the double with respect to the appropriate poisson  lie structure .",
    "we then obtain the coordinate system we are interested in as a restriction of this family to the diagonal subgroup",
    ". the resulting collection of functions serves as an initial cluster for @xmath14 . the fact that the this cluster and the quiver @xmath15 introduced in section 3 form an initial seed of a cluster algebra compatible with the cremmer  gervais poisson structure is proved in section 5 . as a byproduct of our construction we obtain explicit expressions for the casimir functions of the cremmer  gervais bracket . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this is the first time these casimirs have been presented in the literature . in section 6 , we prove that this cluster structure is regular and that it admits a global toric action mandated by the main conjecture .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , like in section 4 , the regularity statement follows from a more general one valid in the double .",
    "this hints at a possibility of endowing the double with a cluster structure associated with the cremmer ",
    "gervais bracket .",
    "the most involved part of the paper is section 7 , where we construct two sequences of cluster transformations needed to implement the final part of the proof presented in section 3 .",
    "the first sequence is used to perform an induction step from @xmath12 to @xmath16 , and the second one allows to realize a linear map on @xmath12 that is anti - poisson with respect to the cremmer  gervais bracket . to construct these sequences we use two crucial features of the initial seed",
    "first , the initial quiver can be embedded into a torus ; second , the cluster variables forming the initial cluster , as well as those obtained in the process of applying cluster transformation forming our sequences , can be represented as minors of a certain matrix of dimensions quadratic in @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding cluster transformations can be modeled on classical determinantal identities and translation invariance properties of this matrix .",
    "the final section contains some technical results on cluster algebras that are used at various stages of the proof .",
    "we start with the basics on cluster algebras of geometric type .",
    "the definition that we present below is not the most general one , see , e.g. , @xcite for a detailed exposition . in what follows , we will write @xmath18 $ ] for an interval @xmath19 in @xmath20 , and we will denote @xmath21 $ ] by @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "besides , given a sequence @xmath23 and a subset @xmath24 $ ] , we will write @xmath25 for the subsequence @xmath26 .    the _ coefficient group _ @xmath27 is a free multiplicative abelian group of finite rank @xmath28 with generators @xmath29 .",

    ". matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 are called the _ exchange matrix _ and the _ extended exchange matrix _ , respectively .",

    "in this situation the extended exchange matrix can be conveniently represented by a _",
