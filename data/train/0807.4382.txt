    "however , the comparison between the core mass function and stellar imf has not often been accurately probed at lower masses .",
    "it is more difficult to study this part of the mass domain , but recent results have shown that the cmf exhibits a turnover at lower masses in a manner similar to the imf @xcite .    the ophiuchus star - forming region is located at a distance of 139  pc @xcite and is a site of low - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "the region consists of two main clouds , l1688 and l1689 , which both have extended streamers leading out to lengths of around 10 pc @xcite . specifically , it is the more massive of the two clouds , l1688 , which is studied in this paper , and which is generally known as the ophiuchus main cloud .",

    ", apertures were drawn following contours on the data map corresponding to the true 3@xmath2 value and the flux density divided in proportion to the peak fluxes of the cores within areas of bright emission .",
    "we found 93 cores , 21 of which had an infrared source associated with them , as identified by spitzer as part of the c2d surveys @xcite .",
    "these latter cores were discounted in our subsequent analysis as not being prestellar .",
    "@xcite mapped a large area around l1688 using a ` fast - mapping ' method .",

    ", we therefore ignored the non - standard data .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the majority of cores in l1688 are found in the central region , and are covered in this study .",
    "the completeness limit of our data can be estimated using the measured sensitivity of the map , together with the average size of the detected cores .",
    "the latter because more mass can be hidden in the noise if the source is larger . in practice",
    "this can be done by scaling the integrated flux density from a number of well detected objects , down to the level where the sources would be just undetected , taking into account the selection criteria . for more details of this technique , see @xcite .",
    "the completeness limit of our map was found to be 0.1 @xmath6 . as an additional check on this limit , we added synthetic sources to the map in a monte carlo fashion and attempted to recover them using the method described above .",
    "we found that for source sizes up to 20@xmath7 we recovered all of the sources and for sources up to 30@xmath7 we recovered 90% .",
    "we assume the 850@xmath0 m integrated flux density is optically thin and so the masses of the cores are calculated using the following equation :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the 850  @xmath0 m flux density , @xmath10 is the distance to the source , @xmath11 is the mass opacity of the gas and dust , and @xmath12 is the planck function at temperature @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "temperatures for each of the regions in the cloud are given in table  [ tabtemp ] .",
    "we calculate the masses using the revised temperatures given by @xcite , hereafter sww07 .",
    "man98 assumed a value for dust mass opacity of @xmath14 = 0.005 @xmath15g@xmath5 for prestellar cores .",
    "this is extrapolated to 850@xmath0 m using the wavelength dependence factor , @xmath16 , which is assumed have a value of 2 in the submillimetre @xcite . we thus obtain a dust opacity value of @xmath11 = 0.01 @xmath15g@xmath5 .",
    "sww07 estimated the dust temperatures of clumps in ophiuchus .",
    "they found that in regions where prestellar cores are observed , temperatures of 10 - 11k are to be expected . specifically they suggest a dust temperature of 10k for all the main regions identified by this study .",
    "the exception to this value is oph - a , containing sm1 ( see table  [ tabtemp ] ) .    for this study we shall assume a distance of 139@xmath46  pc to the ophiuchus cloud @xcite .",
    "this value was determined using hipparcos data and reddening studies . using these new parameters for distance and temperature a new cmf for the region",
    "was created .",
    "in this section we describe cmfs constructed from the above data .",
    "we first compare these with previous work , and then see what can be learnt from our new analysis .",
    "figure  [ cmf - figs ] shows the data from this study plotted in the same way as the mass spectrum from man98 , which has been recreated for comparison .",
    "good agreement is seen .",
    "both datasets show the same power law slopes . below about 2@xmath6 in our data , the slope in the power law decreases from -1.35 to -0.3 ( see section [ our - data ] ) .",
    "this is in aproximate agreement with the man98 results which place this ` knee ' in the high - mass end of the spectrum at approximately 0.5@xmath6 .",
    "the difference in the location of the ` knee ' is explained by the difference in the temperatures and distances assumed by the two studies ( see table  [ tabtemp ] ) .    .",
    "a three part stellar imf ( see text ) , normalised to the peak in n of the cmf , is overlaid as a dotted line .",
    "the three power - law slopes of the imf are also shown fitted to the data as solid black lines , now normalised in m.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    our mass spectrum also shows another decline in the slope at lower masses in the mass range up to 0.7@xmath6 ( figure  [ cmf - figs ] ) .",
    "this effect is seen here , 7 times above our completeness limit , and represents a power law equivalent to the low - mass slope of the stellar imf .",
    "@xcite produced a cumulative cmf for l1688 using some of the same scan - map data ( see their figure  7 ) .",
    "once again , good agreement is seen .",
    "their cmf shows similarities with the two higher - mass slopes of the stellar imf , in agreement with this study .",
    "this earlier study s completeness limit of approximately 0.4@xmath6 prevents comparison at lower masses .",
    "the cmf produced by @xcite shows a ` knee ' at around 0.8@xmath6 . as with the man98 study ,",
    "this feature is also seen in our data when an adjustment is made for the different temperature assumptions of the two studies .      mapped the l1688 region at 1.2 mm using iram .",
    "they produced a mass spectrum with a similar form to that produced in figure  [ cmf - figs]b above .",
    "surveyed 111 starless cores .",
    "although this outnumbers the cores identified in this study , many of these are extended , low surface brightness objects that may not be gravitationally bound .",
    "they concluded that regardless of the details , the cmf resembles the shape of the imf with three power - law slopes presented in their cmf plot .",
    "also show the ` knee ' and a tentative turnover in their cmf .",
    "the positions of these feature are not well constrained but their locations at 0.5 - 1.0m@xmath1 and 0.1 - 0.3m@xmath1 , respectively , are approximately consistent with our data .",
    "@xcite surveyed perseus , serpens , and ophiuchus by comparing bolocam 1.1 mm continuum emission maps with spitzer c2d surveys .",
    "our cmf is consistent with theirs ( see their figure  13 ) .",
    "the 72 cores in our data with no infrared association are used to plot the cmf in figure  [ cmf - hist ] .",
    "the dashed vertical line is the 5@xmath2 completeness limit of 0.1@xmath6 in our map .",
    "this is an improvement over the man98 completeness limit , which is due mainly to the better resolution and sensitivity at 850@xmath0 m provided by the complete scuba data .",
    "figure  [ cmf - hist ] shows our cmf .",
    "the dotted line shows the stellar imf , normalised , in n , to the peak of the cmf . the dotted line is a fit to the power laws of the cmf as outlined below .",
    "cores noted to have an infrared source associated with their position in table  [ tab1 ] are not included .",
    "compared with figure  [ cmf - figs ] , this representation of the data uses a simple number count of cores as opposed to a count divided by the bin size .",
    "figure  [ cmf - hist ] demonstrates that the data are consistent with the three power - laws in the stellar imf .",
    "this is the first time that the full turnover in the cmf has been seen in ophiuchus .",
    "here it is seen at  0.7m@xmath1 .",
    "the only other cloud for which this turnover has been detected is orion @xcite . to compare the cmf to the stellar imf we use a stellar imf with a power law of the following form :",
    "@xmath17    where x takes on different values in different mass regimes . for the stellar imf",
    "we assume the following exponents :    @xmath18    the higher mass end values for x are taken from @xcite .",
    "below 0.08@xmath6 the imf is based on fits to young cluster populations used in @xcite . in this study",
    "values betwen 0.2 and 0.4 are found , so an average of 0.3 is used here .",
    "the striking similarity between the cmf and the stellar imf that is seen in the ophiuchus l1688 cloud , once again gives a strong indication that the form of the imf is determined at the prestellar core stage .",
    "furthermore , we have traced this similarity to lower masses than was previously possible .",
    "this has allowed us to determine the turnover mass in the core mass function .",
    "if it is assumed that each core will form a single star with a fixed star formation efficiency ( @xmath19 ) for all cores , then the cmf can be used to predict an output imf . in this case",
    "the best fit is obtained with @xmath19 = 0.2 ( see figure  [ cmf - sfe ] ) .",
    "this is a simplistic model , and the shape of the cmf does not change as a function of @xmath19 .    a more sophisticated approach than ` one core",
    ", one star ' would be to model the transformation between core masses and stellar masses in a way that produces multiple stars from each core .",
    "discuss what they call the ` fully multiple star model ' .",
    "this model assumes that cores with masses lower than a certain mass , m@xmath20 , will form binary systems and larger cores will form binary or multiple systems .",
    "m@xmath20 = @xmath19@xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the location of the ` knee ' in figure  [ cmf - hist ] ( see also ) .",
    "thus for this study we use m@xmath20 = 2@xmath19@xmath6 .    using the ` fully multiple star model '",
    "it is possible to transform the cmf in figure  [ cmf - hist ] to produce a potential , future stellar imf for l1688  see figure  [ cmf - goodwin ] .",
    "this plot shows very good agreement with the real stellar imf .",
    "the best fit model here requires @xmath19 = 0.4 .",
    "it is important to remember that this is the star formation efficiency within gravitationally bound cores , and so a high value is to be expected .",
    "the total mass of prestellar cores in l1688 is 29.3@xmath6 .",
    "the total mass of the l1688 cloud complex is 1447@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "coupling this to our value of @xmath19 = 0.4 for the prestellar cores gives a value for the absolute star formation efficiency of the central portion of the l1688 cloud of about 1 - 2% .",
    "@xcite used the scuba data archive to produce a cmf for the orion molecular cloud and found a turnover in the cmf at  1.3@xmath6 .",
    "this is a factor of two higher than the cmf turnover seen here at  0.7@xmath6 in the l1688 cloud .",
    "however we note that the difference is not significantly greater than one bin - width .",
    "hence , studies with larger number statistics will be needed to verify this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the instrumentation and methodology for deriving the properties of cores is the same in both studies .",
    "both regions can be modelled using the method described in the previous section , but only by using different values for the sfe .",
    "these results suggest that the position of the turnover in the cmf may vary with the environment in which the cores reside .",
    "in this paper we have re - analysed the scuba archive data for l1688 , incorporating all available high signal - to - noise scan - map and jiggle - map data .",
    "an updated form of the cmf in the l1688 cloud complex has been presented using updated values for the distance to this region as well as new estimates for the temperatures of the cores .",
    "we have shown that the cmf for l1688 is consistent with a three part power - law with slopes the same as seen in the stellar imf .",
    "the higher - mass end of the cmf declines as a power law which is consistent with other studies of l1688 as well as studies of orion .",
    "hence , the results are mostly in agreement with those found in earlier studies .",
    "however , our deeper maps have allowed the discovery of a turnover in the cmf at 0.7@xmath6 which shows that the core mass function continues to mimic the stellar initial mass function to low masses .",
    "this agreement is indicative that the stellar imf is determined at the prestellar core stage .",
    "it has been shown that the relationship between the cmf and imf is not necessarily a simple 1:1 translation in the mass axis .",
