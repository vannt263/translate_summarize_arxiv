    "in this study , we are interested in the ave with non - hermitian toeplitz matrix of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the component - wise absolute value of the vector @xmath2 . a slightly more generalized form of the ave , @xmath3 was discussed in @xcite and investigated in a more general context in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the theoretical and numerical aspects of these problems have been extensively investigated in recent literature @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the ave ( [ ku1 ] ) arises from quadratic programs , linear programs , bimatrix games and other problems , which can all be resulted in an linear complementarity problem ( lcp ) @xcite , and the lcp is equivalent to the ave ( [ ku1 ] ) .",
    "this means that the ave is np - hard in its general form @xcite . if @xmath4 , then generalized ave ( [ ku2 ] ) reduces to a system of linear equations @xmath5 , which have several applications in scientific computation @xcite .",
    "the recent research concerning the ave contents can be summarized as the following aspects , one is the theoretical analysis , which focuses on the theorem of alternatives , various equivalent reformulations , and the existence and nonexistence of solutions ; refer to @xcite for details .",
    "and the other is how to solve the ave numerically . in the last decade ,",
    "based on the fact that the lcp can be reduced to the ave , which enjoys a very special and simple structure , a large variety of numerical methods for solving the ave ( [ ku1 ] ) can be found in the recent literature ; see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "for example , a finite computational algorithm that is solved by a finite succession of linear programs ( slp ) in @xcite , and a semi - smooth newton method is proposed in @xcite , which largely shortens the computation time than the slp method .",
    "furthermore , a smoothing newton algorithm was presented in @xcite , which was proved to be globally convergent and the convergence rate was quadratic under the condition that the singular values of @xmath6 exceed 1 .",
    "this condition was weaker than the one applied in @xcite .    during recent years",
    ", the picard - hss iteration method and nonlinear hss - like method are established to solve the ave in succession @xcite , respectively . the sufficient conditions to guarantee the convergence of this method and some numerical experiments",
    "are given to show the effectiveness of the method .",
    "however , the numbers of the inner hss iterative steps are often problem - dependent and difficult to be determined in actual computations .",
    "moreover , the iterative vector can not be updated timely .",
    "it has shown that the nonlinear hss - like iterative method is more efficient than the picard - hss iteration method in aspects of the defect mentioned above , which is designed originally for solving weakly nonlinear systems in @xcite . in order to accelerate the nonlinear hss - like iteration method ,",
    "zhang @xcite had extended the preconditioned hss ( phss ) method @xcite to solve the ave and also exploit the relaxation technique to accelerate his proposed methods . meanwhile",
    ", numerical results also show the effectiveness of his proposed method in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the special case of @xmath6 involving the non - hermitian toeplitz structure .",
    "similar to the strategies of @xcite , two kinds of circulant and skew - circulant splitting ( cscs)-based methods are proposed to fast solve the ave ( [ ku1 ] ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the cscs iteration method and its relative topics . in section 3 , we devote to introduce two cscs - based iteration methods to solve ave ( [ ku1 ] ) and investigate their convergence properties , respectively .",
    "numerical experiments are reported in section 4 , to shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the cscs - based methods .",
    "finally , the paper closes with some conclusions in section 5 .",
    "here let @xmath7 be a non - hermitian toeplitz matrix of the following form @xmath8 i.e. , @xmath6 is constant along its diagonals ; see @xcite , and @xmath9 be a zero matrix , the general ave ( [ ku2 ] ) reduced to the system of linear equations @xmath10    it is well - known that a toeplitz matrix @xmath6 possesses a circulant and skew - circulant splitting @xcite @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 note that @xmath14 is a circulant matrix and @xmath15 is a skew - circulant matrix",
    ". a circulant matrix can be diagonalized by the discrete fourier matrix @xmath16 and a skew - circulant matrix can be diagonalized by a discrete fourier matrix with diagonal scaling , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "that is to say , it holds that @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the imaginary unit @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are diagonal matrices formed by the eigenvalues of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , which can be obtained in @xmath23 operations by using the fft . moreover , ng @xcite established the following cscs iteration method to solve non - hermitian toeplitz system of linear equations ( [ ku3 ] ) .",
    "* algorithm 1 the cscs iteration method*. + _ given an initial guess @xmath24 , compute @xmath25 for @xmath26 using the following iterative scheme until @xmath27 converges , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a positive constant and @xmath30 is the identity matrix . _    in the matrix - vector form",
    ", the cscs iteration can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath31 where @xmath32 it is easy to see that cscs is a stationary iterative method obtained from the splitting @xmath33 where @xmath34 on the other hand , we have @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the iterative matrix of the cscs method .",
    "we remark that the cscs iteration method is greatly similar to the hss iteration method @xcite and its variants , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "when the circulant part @xmath14 and skew - circulant part @xmath15 of the coefficient matrix @xmath37 are both positive definite , ng proved that the spectral radius @xmath38 of the cscs iterative matrix @xmath36 is less than 1 for any positive iterative parameters @xmath29 , i.e. , the cscs iteration method unconditionally converges to the exact solution of @xmath39 for any initial guess @xmath40 ; refer to @xcite for details .",
    "motivated by the pioneer works of @xcite , we extend the classical cscs iteration method to two types of cscs - based methods for solving the ave ( [ ku1 ] ) .",
    "these methods will fully exploit the toeplitz structure to accelerate the computation speed and save storage .",
    "next , we will devote to constructing these two new methods , i.e. , the picard - cscs iterative method and nonlinear cscs - like iterative method .",
    "recalling that the picard iterative method is a fixed - point iterative method and the linear term @xmath41 and the nonlinear term @xmath42 are separated @xcite , the ave can be solved by using of the picard iterative method @xmath43 we assume that the toeplitz matrix @xmath6 is non - hermitian positive definite . in this case , the next iterate of @xmath44 can be approximately computed by the cscs iteration by making use of @xmath45 as following ( see @xcite ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the matrices defined in the previous section , @xmath29 is a positive constant , @xmath49 a prescribed sequence of positive integers , and @xmath50 is the starting point of the inner cscs iteration at @xmath51th outer picard iteration .",
    "this leads to the inexact picard iteration method , called picard - cscs iteration method , for solving the system ( [ ku1 ] ) which can be summarized as following ( refer to @xcite ) .",

    "set @xmath60 .",
    "the advantage of picard - cscs iterative method is obvious .",
    "first , the two linear subsystems in all inner cscs iterations have the same shifted circulant coefficient matrix @xmath61 and shifted skew - circulant coefficient matrix @xmath62 , which are constant with respect to the iteration index @xmath51 .",
    "second , the exact solutions can be efficiently achieved via ffts in @xmath23 operations @xcite .",
    "hence , the computations of the picard - cscs iteration method could be much cheaper than that of the picard - hss iteration method .",
    "the next theorem provides sufficient conditions for the convergence of the picard - cscs method to solve system ( [ ku1 ] ) .",

    "the two sub - systems of linear equations involved are solved in the way if @xmath156 , then @xmath157 . moreover ,",
    "if the two sub - systems of linear equations involved in the picard - cscs and the nonlinear cscs - like iteration methods are solved by making use of the method presented in @xcite and using parallel computing , the numerical results of the picard - cscs and the nonlinear cscs - like iteration methods must be better .    in practical implementations ,",
    "the optimal parameter @xmath158 recommended in @xcite is employed for the picard - hss and the nonlinear hss - like methods , where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the minimum and the maximum eigenvalues of the hermitian part @xmath70 of the coefficient matrix @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , we adopt the optimal parameters @xmath161 given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) for the picard - cscs and the nonlinear cscs - like methods . at the same time",
    ", it is remarkable that they only minimize the bound of the convergence factor of the iteration matrix , but not the spectral radius of the iteration matrix .",
    "admittedly , the optimal parameters are crucial for guaranteeing fast convergence speeds of these parameter - dependent iteration methods , but they are generally very difficult to be determined , refer to e.g. @xcite for a discussion of these issues .    to show that the proposed iteration methods can also be efficiently applied to deal with complex system of aves ( [ ku1 ] )",
    ", we construct and test the following example , which is a toeplitz system of aves with complex matrix .",
    "* example 1*. we consider that @xmath7 is a complex non - hermitian , sparse and positive definite toeplitz matrix with the following form @xmath162 where @xmath163 .",
    "it means that the matrices @xmath6 in the target aves are defined as eq .",
    "( [ matrix2 ] ) . according to the performances of hss - based methods ,",
    "see @xcite , compared with other early established methods , we compare the proposed cscs - based methods with hss - based methods in example 1",
    ". then we will choose different parameters @xmath164 and @xmath165 and present the corresponding numerical results in tables [ tab2]-[tab3 ] .",
    ".the optimal parameters @xmath166 for example 1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab7 ]    based on the numerical results in tables [ tab5]-[tab7 ] ,",
    "it is notable that these four iterative solvers , i.e. , the picard - cscs and the nonlinear cscs - like , can successfully obtain approximate solutions to the system of aves for all different matrix dimensions ; whereas both the gn - gmres(5 ) and the gn - tfqmr iterative methods fully fail to converge .",
    "it should be because the newton - like iterative methods are usually sensitive to the initial guess and the accuracy of solving inner linear systems .",
    "when the matrix dimension @xmath167 is increasing , the number of outer iteration steps are almost fixed or or decreasing slightly for all iteration methods , whereas the number of inner iteration steps show the contrary phenomena for the cases with @xmath168 and @xmath169 . meanwhile , the total cpu times and total iteration steps for both the picard - cscs and the nonlinear cscs - like iterative methods are increasing quickly except the cases of @xmath170 with @xmath171 and @xmath172 . on the other hand , from tables [ tab5]-[tab7 ] , we also observe that both the nonlinear cscs - like method is almost more competitive than the picard - cscs iteration methods in terms of the number of iteration steps and the cpu elapsed time for solving the system of aves .",
    "in particular , it is remarkable that the nonlinear cscs - like method can use slightly less number of iteration steps to converge than the picard - cscs iterative solver , but the picard - cscs iterative solver can save a little elapsed cpu time with compared to the nonlinear cscs - like iterative method in our implementations .",
    "however , it still concludes that the nonlinear cscs - like iterative method is the first choice for solving the aves concerning in example 2 . at the same time , the picard - cscs iterative method can be viewed as a good alternative .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed two cscs - based methods for solving the system of aves with non - hermitian toeplitz structure .",
    "two cscs - based iterative methods are based on separable property of the linear term @xmath173 and nonlinear term @xmath42 as well as the circulant and skew - circulant splitting ( cscs ) of involved non - hermitian definite toeplitz matrix @xmath6 . by leveraging the smoothing approximate function ,",
    "the locally convergence have been analysed .",
    "further numerical experiments have shown that the picard - cscs and the nonlinear cscs - like iteration methods are feasible and efficient nonlinear solvers for the ave . moreover ,",
    "in particular , the nonlinear cscs - like method often does better than the picard - cscs method to solve ave is that the smoothing approximate function is introduced in the convergence analysis although is avoid in implement algorithm .",
    "hence , to find a better theoretical proof for cscs - like will be a topics and suitable accelerated techniques @xcite in the future research .",
