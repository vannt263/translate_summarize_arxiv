    "bubbles , such as soap bubbles , are objects with simple geometry and physical properties .",
    "but when two or more bubbles cluster together , how well do we really understand their properties ?",
    "the limiting case of a cluster of many bubbles , known as a foam , is usually approached with continuum approximations .",
    "an understanding of foam properties such as aging , due to gas diffusion , and structure is a problem of fundamental interest stimulated by the need to predict the behaviour of foam in industrial applications . from carbonated drinks to the processes used to extract gold ore from the earth ,",
    "foams are an important part of our lives with various industrial uses @xcite .",
    "the alternative to the continuum description , described here , is an approach based upon the study of finite clusters of bubbles .",
    "its advantage is the ease with which we can obtain precise structural information .",
    "a further benefit of studying finite , rather than infinite or periodic , foams is that the bubbles are not `` frustrated '' , so that we get a measure of their free shape , rather than one influenced by long - distance correlations between bubbles .",
    "this has been demonstrated convincingly in two - dimensions ( 2d ) , where exact results exist for two problems of paramount interest :    * the kelvin problem : what is the least energy ( equivalent to line - length ) structure of equal - size bubbles that fills space ? in 2d , @xcite proved that this is the familiar honeycomb structure . in 3d , where the problem is one of minimizing surface energy or area , no such exact result exists .",
    "kelvin @xcite gave a candidate structure , still believed to be the best for a structure containing _ identical _ cells , although in the general case it has since been beaten by the weaire - phelan structure @xcite consisting of bubbles of two different types .",
    "the important quantity in this problem is the surface area of each face of a bubble of unit volume , or equivalently the normalized total surface area @xmath0 .",
    "* growth laws : how does a foam age , or _ coarsen _ , due to gas diffusion across its surfaces ?",
    "the 2d result , due to @xcite , says that the growth - rate of a bubble ( of area @xmath1 ) is directly linked to its number of sides , @xmath2 : @xmath3 .",
    "that is , it depends upon bubble topology only , irrespective of the precise geometry . in 3d , the growth law",
    "is written @xcite : @xmath4 where the sum is taken over each face , which has a pressure difference @xmath5 and area @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is an effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "again , the normalized area appears to be important , but does the 3d growth law depend only on the bubble topology ?",
    "in fact it does not , but it may make sense to express the average growth - rate of @xmath8-faced bubbles as a function of @xmath8 only _ if _ the dispersion about such a law is small .",
    "the study of 3d foam coarsening was pioneered by @xcite , who used a 3d potts model to numerically simulate foam coarsening .",
    "he proposed a linear growth law @xmath9 for bubbles with a number of faces @xmath8 from 6 to 57 ( and even from 4 to 60 , with some numerical uncertainty ) .",
    "similar linear laws were observed in subsequent experiments involving optical tomography and reconstruction using the surface evolver @xcite ( @xmath8 between 9 and 16 ) , and magnetic resonance imaging experiments @xcite for @xmath8 from 4 to 26 .",
    "this growth law was refined by three detailed results presented by @xcite : first , an approximate analytical formula based upon regular @xmath8-faced polyhedra with curved faces :    @xmath10^{2/3 }   \\tan^{1/3}\\left(\\frac{\\chi_f}{2}\\right )   \\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{3}- \\chi_f \\right ) \\label{eq : hilgengf}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the number of edges per face . for large @xmath8",
    ", this shows a square - root dependence , @xmath13 , effective for @xmath8 greater than about 15 .",
    "second , a ( non - explicit ) correction for non - regular faces ; third , numerical ( surface evolver ) simulations for foams containing bubbles with @xmath8 from 5 to 42 .",
    "recently , @xcite also used the surface evolver to calculate numerically the structural properties of single `` regular '' bubbles with surfaces of constant mean curvature ; this gave information for certain values of @xmath8 between 2 and 32 .      here , we study clusters consisting of one bubble surrounded by @xmath8 others , each with prescribed volumes .",
    "this constitutes a finite cluster with free boundary conditions : this represents a realistic foam surrounded by air , in contrast to the idealisation used to derive ( [ eq : hilgengf ] ) @xcite .",
    "we chose such an approach , which neglects long - distance correlations between bubbles , because it should provide more physical insight than existing experiments and simulations , and enable more precise calculations than the analytical approach . within this",
    "`` mean - field '' choice , all results presented below are highly accurate , without approximations . moreover , in principle we should have access to all physically realizable values of @xmath8 .    in the course of our study of the equal - volume case , we encountered what we call  the kissing problem for ( deformable ) bubbles \" .",
    "our simulations allow us to ask : how many deformable ( dry ) bubbles can be packed around one other ?",
    "the original kissing problem , discussed by gregory and newton , was : how many identical hard spheres can surround one other , each touching the central one @xcite ?",
    "in two - dimensions the answer is obvious and well - known  only six hard discs can be packed around one other , in the familiar honeycomb arrangement .",
    "for the three - dimensional problem , consideration of the angle subtended by each sphere at the central one suggested that the maximum number could be as high as 14 , but newton was correct in believing that only 12 neighbours are possible @xcite .",
    "we will present arguments suggesting that for bubbles these critical numbers are 12 ( 2d ) and 32 ( 3d ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first describe our method of cluster preparation and relaxation .",
    "there are limits , for each set of given bubble volumes , to the values of @xmath8 for which stable clusters exists . in the equal - volume case",
    "we offer a solution to the kissing problem .",
    "we then analyse in more detail the shape and growth - rate of many different bubbles , and present predictions about coarsening and quantify the spread of the growth - rate about the growth law ( [ eq : hilgengf ] ) .",
    "we take a central bubble of volume @xmath14 and surround it with @xmath8 bubbles , each with the same volume @xmath15 ; this is the natural extension into 3d of the 2d `` flower '' of @xcite .",
    "to create and equilibrate such a cluster , we use a voronoi construction with vcs @xcite and then the surface evolver @xcite , as follows .",
    "we must first make a choice about the topology of the cluster . since we wish to create the cluster using a voronoi routine , we must first choose an arrangement of @xmath16 points about which to create bubbles .",
    "we first place a point at the origin of a sphere of radius 1",
    ". then the voronoi points are placed at the positions given by the solution of the  covering radius problem \" @xcite : the arrangement of @xmath8 points on the unit sphere that minimizes the maximum distance of any point from its closest neighbour .",
    "candidates to the solution of this problem have been given by @xcite for @xmath8 from 4 to 130 , which is exactly what is required for our purpose .",
    "note that this is not the only way to pack the @xmath8 voronoi points , but appears ( partly with hindsight ) to have been a good choice ",
    "it gives all the arrangements we know to expect , e.g. for @xmath17 .",
    "we truncate the voronoi diagram by adding @xmath18 points at a radial distance of @xmath19 from the origin .",
    "we ensure that these outer points are at least a distance @xmath20 apart , decreasing @xmath21 from 1 until a solution is found , usually at around @xmath22 .",
    "this data is put through the vcs software ; the output file is then transferred to the surface evolver , version 2.18d .",
    "we use two levels of refinement and quadratic mode , to obtain a high level of accuracy  we estimate all values to be accurate to at least four decimal places .",
    "we compute the following quantities for the @xmath23 face ( @xmath24 ) of the central bubble : its number of sides @xmath25 , area @xmath6 and pressure difference @xmath26 . then for the whole bubble we record its volume @xmath15 , its normalized total line length @xmath27 , its normalized surface area @xmath0 ( where @xmath28 ) , and its growth - rate through eq .",
    "( [ eq : growth1 ] ) , which we plot as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "we first consider the case where the volume of the central bubble is equal to that of its neighbours , @xmath29 .",
    "examples of such monodisperse clusters are shown in figure [ fig : picsvc1 ] for @xmath30 and 26 .",
    "this illustrates that despite the rather symmetric initial condition ( putting points on a sphere ) we can still obtain significantly skewed bubbles after relaxation .     in each case :",
    "( a ) cluster of @xmath30 outer bubbles ( that is , a total of @xmath31 bubbles ) still attached ; ( b ) the central bubble , drawn to a different scale , with @xmath30 faces ( this is a matzke cell @xcite with one square , ten pentagonal and two hexagonal faces ) ; ( c ) a bubble with @xmath32 faces ( all pentagonal or hexagonal )  note its departure from approximate sphericity , described in  [ sec : kiss].,width=566 ]      for completeness , we consider first the two - dimensional problem .",
    "how many 2d bubbles can be packed around one other of the same area ?",
    "our initial pattern is that of the `` flower '' clusters introduced recently @xcite .",
    "it consists of a central cell of area @xmath33 surrounded by @xmath8 identical petals of area @xmath1 .",
    "a symmetric example with @xmath34 petals and @xmath35 is shown in figure [ fig:2dkiss](a ) .",
    "a priori , one could imagine that the number of petals could increase without limit , with the @xmath8 sides of the central bubble becoming increasingly curved .",
    "however , @xcite showed that for @xmath36 there is a `` buckling '' instability at a critical ratio of the bubble areas given approximately by @xmath37 for unit areas and @xmath38 , the symmetric shape is therefore no longer stable , the flower becomes `` floppy '' and many modes of buckling , corresponding to different shaped central bubbles , are possible ( all with the same energy ) .",
    "an example for @xmath34 , in which there is an elliptical mode of buckling , is shown in figure [ fig:2dkiss](b ) .",
    "petals and @xmath39 .",
    "( b ) one of the possible stable buckled states of the same cluster with @xmath40 .",
    "( c ) one of the possible `` ejected ''",
    "states @xcite with @xmath30 petals and @xmath40.,width=566 ]    is it possible to pack even more bubbles ? we find that for @xmath41 , any of the buckled configurations of clusters with unit areas are unstable to a topological change caused by the length of one of the internal edges shrinking to zero @xcite .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig:2dkiss](c ) for @xmath30 , for which three bubbles are `` ejected '' in an equilibrium configuration with @xmath42 .",
    "thus we conjecture that the maximum number of bubbles that can touch the central one is 12 .",
    "this is twice the value for hard discs .      in three dimensions",
    "the idea is the same . in principle",
    "one could imagine that there should be no limit to the number of bubbles which will fit around the central one , albeit with the latter being hugely distorted .",
    "however , since the area of each of the five - sided faces shrinks as @xmath8 increases , our simulations of bubbles with unit volumes , @xmath43 do not find a stable cluster for all possible values of @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , we could only find clusters for @xmath44 .",
    "that is , we can not obtain a bubble with more than @xmath45 faces and volume equal to that of its neighbours which satisfies plateau s laws after energy ( surface area ) minimization .    for most values of @xmath8 , the shrinkage of five - sided faces",
    "is accelerated by an ellipsoidal distortion of the central bubble ( see figure [ fig : picsvc1](c ) ) , due to the asymmetric location of the pentagonal faces amongst the hexagonal ones .",
    "might there be a discontinuous buckling transition for 3d clusters ? as a result of further simulations , we believe not : this asymmetry , and the consequent elliptical deformation of the central bubble , means that the transition to the asymmetric pattern is continuous .    it is interesting to note that the case @xmath46 is special : it is probably the most symmetric cluster for @xmath47  it corresponds to the @xmath48 fullerene .",
    "hence , by analogy , one might expect that stable clusters with unit volumes exist for higher order carbon structures .",
    "we tried @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and the elliptical @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and did nt find them to be stable .",
    "we thus conjecture that no more than 32 bubbles can touch the central one : 32 appears to be the `` kissing '' number for 3d bubbles .",
    "recall that for hard spheres the kissing number is 12 .",
    "we next analyse in detail the statistics of the bubbles found in our simulations .",
    "we consider first the monodisperse case , relevant to the kelvin problem , where the volume of the central bubble is equal to that of its neighbours , @xmath53 .",
    "as mentioned above , we can go from @xmath8 = 5 to 32 .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 , shown in figure [ fig : coversv23 ] , is lowest at @xmath34 ( consistent with data for random monodisperse foams @xcite ) , and increases steeply for @xmath8 greater than about 16 .",
    "varies , albeit over a small range , non - monotonically as @xmath8 increases .",
    "inset : zoom over the range @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "data is shown for volume ratios of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "for all values of the volume ratio @xmath58 , the pentagonal dodecahedron at @xmath34 has the same value of @xmath0 , but for all other @xmath8 the surface area fluctuates widely , although in general it decreases as the volume ratio increases .",
    "also shown is the data for bubbles with constant curvature @xmath59 rather than with fixed volume @xcite . shown as horizontal lines ( from top to bottom )",
    "are the value of @xmath0 for the kelvin structure ( solid line ) , for the weaire - phelan structure ( quadruple dashes ) , for the `` ideal '' flat - faced bubble ( triple dashes ) and for an infinitely large bubble with hexagonal faces ( double dashes ) @xcite.,width=566 ]    the inset on figure [ fig : coversv23 ] shows the data around the optimal region @xmath54 to 16 .",
    "these bubbles , which do not pack to fill space , have lower area than kelvin s ( 5.306 ) and even weaire - phelan s ( 5.288 ) ( see @xcite for details of other space - filling foam structures ) .",
    "they are barely above the value for the so - called `` ideal '' bubble ( 5.254 ) @xcite .",
    "the latter , with @xmath60 , describes a regular ( but unphysical ) `` bubble '' which would have flat faces , and hence a growth - rate of zero .    also of interest is the normalized line - length @xmath27 of each bubble , plotted in figure [ fig : coverlv13 ] .",
    "note that all data lies close to a line @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we therefore show the ratio @xmath62 in figure [ fig : coverlv13 ] : the maximum deviation ( i.e. the shallow minimum in the data ) occurs for @xmath63",
    ".     increases in proportion to the square - root of @xmath8 @xcite ( inset ) .",
    "we therefore plot the ratio @xmath62 , for volume ratios of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the data is everywhere close to @xmath64 , confirming the square - root behaviour .",
    "the dispersity increases as both @xmath8 and @xmath58 increase.,width=566 ]        we next consider the case where the volume of the central bubble is not equal to the volume of its neighbours .",
    "there are again limits to the possible stable clusters , but they vary with the volume ratio .",
    "we study the simple ratios @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this choice of volume ratios allows us to explore @xmath8 from 4 to 60 .",
    "note that the possible range of @xmath8 is not always continuous .",
    "for instance , we can not construct a stable cluster with 26 neighbours for @xmath67 , hence we find @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "similarly , 11 neighbours is unstable for @xmath69 , and we find @xmath70 $ ] .    for each value of @xmath8 we record the topology of each bubble , collated for all volume ratios ( table [ tab : face_sides ] ) , using the notation @xmath71 to mean that the bubble has @xmath72-faces with @xmath2-sides .",
    "the topology of the central bubble might depend on @xmath58 : we find such non - uniqueness in only two instances .",
    "we accept this as due to the slight randomness used in placing the @xmath18 outer points to truncate the initial voronoi pattern .",
    "@xmath73    the line - length , shown in figure [ fig : coverlv13 ] , fall close to the same curve as in the monodisperse case .",
    "the square - root approximation becomes slightly worse as the bubbles become larger and gain more faces , with the maximum deviation occurring at higher @xmath8 for increasing @xmath58 .",
    "with larger @xmath58 we can look at bubbles with many faces and very low surface areas .",
    "for instance , with @xmath74 ( corresponding to the fullerene @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 we find a bubble with topology @xmath77 and @xmath78 : see figure [ fig : optimalsf ]",
    ".    we could extend this process to larger bubbles with more faces .",
    "the normalized area should eventually approach the value for an infinitely large bubble with hexagonal faces : @xmath79 @xcite ; note that this is not the theoretical lower bound for the normalized area , which corresponds to a spherical bubble with @xmath80 infinitesimally small neighbours @xcite .",
    "real foams often have a distribution of bubble volumes , and their topology is correlated to the geometry : larger bubbles tend to have more neighbours @xcite .",
    "such correlations appear in our results , although we did not specifically include them .",
    "their physical origin is clear .",
    "in fact , consider a bubble of volume @xmath14 , and consider the average of its neighbours volumes , denoted @xmath15 ( mean - field description ) .",
    "then , for this given @xmath58 ratio , the physically realizable values of @xmath8 are limited . within the possible @xmath8 , the @xmath81 curves admit an optimum : there is a value of @xmath8 which minimizes the bubble area .",
    "these optimal @xmath8 values do increase with @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , on figure [ fig : coversv23 ] we can read the optimal surface @xmath82 as a function of @xmath8 : it is the envelope of all curves plotted , shown in figure [ fig : optimalsf ] .",
    "it decreases roughly as one over the square - root of @xmath8 as the volume ratio increases .     for a range of values of the volume ratio @xmath58 .",
    "data are shown for values of @xmath83 and @xmath66 ( @xmath84 ) and for the representative calculation for @xmath74 with @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the limiting value for @xmath87 at @xmath88 is shown as a horizontal line and we also show a power - law fit : @xmath89.,width=566 ]    in 2d , the expression for @xmath90 _ versus _ @xmath2 has been used to estimate the energy of a 2d foam @xcite , then to determine the correlations between geometry ( area @xmath1 ) and topology ( number of sides @xmath2 ) @xcite . here , its 3d counterpart , the @xmath91 _ versus _ @xmath8 relation , is more complicated ( in particular , unlike in 2d , it depends on the volume ratio ) @xcite : but it appears to have the same essential property as in 2d , namely to be a non - increasing function of @xmath8 ; we thus hope to extend to 3d this 2d result @xcite",
    ".    in the theory of foam drainage , in which liquid flows along the edges separating the faces ( plateau borders ) , and the coupling of drainage with coarsening , it is useful to know the following two dimensionless parameters @xcite : @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the average length of an edge in an @xmath95faced bubble .",
    "we can calculate these quantities from our results , and they are shown in figure [ fig : vsl ] ; both increase strongly with the number of faces @xmath8 and are insensitive to the size of the neighbouring bubbles .     and surface area @xmath96 of a bubble with @xmath8 faces scaled with the average length of an edge @xmath94 .",
    "the data for the surface area is affine , @xmath97 , while for low @xmath8 the volume data is approximately quadratic , @xmath98 .",
    "data is shown for all volume ratios @xmath58 considered here , and the inset shows details of @xmath15 and @xmath96 for bubbles with 11 to 16 faces.,width=566 ]      as a result of these simulations , we are able to calculate the instantaneous growth - rate of many bubbles , with many different numbers of sides , through the formula ( [ eq : growth1 ] ) .",
    "it is shown in the inset to figure [ fig : coverdvdt ]  all data lies close to ( [ eq : hilgengf ] ) , except at ( for us unobtainable ) small @xmath8 where the results of @xcite are useful .",
    "more instructive is the difference between the analytic formula and our data , shown in figure [ fig : coverdvdt ] . for @xmath99 , our data are above and below the analytic line : it agrees with the suggestion that the analytic formula approximates the average growth - rate @xcite , and quantifies the dispersion around this average ( less than 1 % dispersion ) .",
    "conversely , for @xmath100 , our data are clustered and significantly ( up to 10 % ) larger than the analytical formula , which confirms that the analytical approximations gradually lose their validity at low @xmath8 , as expected @xcite . in a coarsening foam ,",
    "the bubbles with low @xmath8 are important because it is these bubbles that disappear .",
    "so although for @xmath101 the growth - rate is well approximated by ( [ eq : hilgengf ] ) , we give in table [ tab : lowfgrow ] the growth - rates for bubbles with @xmath100 , averaged over all simulations . these are almost indistinguishable from the growth rates calculated exactly on ideal bubbles @xcite : the agreement for @xmath102 to @xmath103 is better than 1% , and it is even lower than 0.1% for regular bubbles ( @xmath102 and 6 ) .",
    "@xmath104     faces , calculated from our simulations using ( [ eq : growth1 ] ) , and the value calculated according to the analytic formula ( [ eq : hilgengf ] ) .",
    "the inset shows the values themselves , again next to the analytic line , from which it deviates at small @xmath8 .",
    "data is shown for volume ratios of @xmath105 and @xmath57 .",
    "the data for bubbles with constant curvature @xmath59 @xcite , rather than fixed volume , is more scattered , but useful for low @xmath8.,width=566 ]",
    "the structure of a foam in equilibrium minimizes its ( free ) energy , which is the product of ( i ) two quantities characterising the system ( surface tension and average surface area ) and ( ii ) some function of shape only .",
    "the structure changes due to coarsening .",
    "the coarsening rate is the product of a diffusion constant ( which depends on the material parameters , including chemical composition ) , that sets the characteristic time scale , and a function only of geometry . here",
    ", we do nt consider two other phenomena , drainage and film breakage , which cause deviations from equilibrium .",
    "using the surface evolver , we have studied finite clusters of bubbles to give information about the structure of three - dimensional foam and a 3d coarsening law .",
    "this approach allows us to get a high level of detail and accuracy of the relevant quantities ( surface area , pressure difference ) to get a good insight into how foams coarsen .",
    "our calculated values of the growth law require no assumption about the curvature being small , and can be found for bubbles with an arbitrary number of faces .    as the volume ratio between the central bubble and its neighbours changes , we find upper and lower bounds on the possible number of faces , because the bubbles deform .",
    "this leads us to conjecture a value for the kissing problem for foams : no more than 32 bubbles can be stably packed around one other of the same volume .",
    "although we do nt tackle infinite ( or , equivalently , periodic ) structures , we expect that this data will eventually lead to greater insight into the kelvin problem , since we are starting to understand better what happens for bubbles with between 12 and 16 faces .",
    "we thank professor k. brakke for having distributed and maintained his surface evolver program . this work benefited from a stay at the isaac newton institute in cambridge , and , in particular , discussions with a. kraynik , s. hilgenfeldt and j. glazier .",
