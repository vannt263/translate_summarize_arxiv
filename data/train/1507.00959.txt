    "lately , an emerging amount of issues indicates that the collisionless cold dark matter ( ccdm ) paradigm is at odds with astrophysical observations .",
    "the first and most well known issue is related to the fact that dwarf galaxies have a flat density core  @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies are dominated by dark matter ( dm ) and the flatness of the density profile in the core of the galaxy is in contradiction with the cuspy profiles predicted by numerical simulations of ccdm  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of ccdm predict also a larger number of satellite galaxies in the milky way than what has been observed so far  @xcite .",
    "although our galaxy might simply be a statistical fluctuation  @xcite there might be dim galaxies yet to be observed , it is possible that dm is simply not collisionless .",
    "furthermore , another related issue is the so - called  too big to fail \" problem  @xcite , i.e. ccdm numerical simulations predict massive dwarf galaxies that are too big to not have visible stars and thus to not be observed .",
    "although some of the aforementioned issues can be resolved upon assuming the existence of baryonic - dm interactions  @xcite , another probably more attractive and natural possibility is the existence of dm self - interactions .",
    "clearly such interactions would flatten out cuspy dwarf galaxy cores and they could possibly also resolve the satellite galaxies issues  @xcite .",
    "dm self - interactions have already been proposed and studied in different contexts  @xcite .",
    "dm numerical simulations including self - interactions favor a dm - dm cross section per dm mass between @xmath0 . within this range",
    ", dm self - interactions can solve the cusp vs core problem of dwarf galaxies as well as the  too big to fail \" one .",
    "however , dm self - interactions can not be arbitrarily strong .",
    "there are several constraints imposed on them .",
    "first of all one should make sure that dm - dm interactions are not sufficiently strong to destroy the ellipticity of spiral galaxies  @xcite or dissociate the subclusters of the bullet cluster  @xcite .",
    "in addition , fermionic asymmetric dm with attractive yukawa - type self - interactions can lead in some cases to formation of destructive black holes in the interior of old neutron stars , thus imposing extra constraints  @xcite .",
    "further constraints are imposed in the case where the mediator of the dm - dm force couples to the standard model .",
    "the mediator @xmath1 can simply couple to the standard model via e.g. a higgs portal  @xcite .",
    "in such a case one should make sure that @xmath1 decays before the start of the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the fact that a minimum strength between baryons and @xmath1 is required for not spoiling the bbn predictions can lead to significant rates of dm collisions in underground detectors that can exclude such models  @xcite .",
    "however constraints like these can be evaded if e.g. @xmath1 couples also to sterile or active neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "one should emphasize that the above constraints are model dependent and therefore although there is no clear universal region where dm self - interactions are allowed , the region @xmath2 which accommodate the resolution of the dwarf galaxies problems is roughly speaking constraint free .    if dm experiences self - interacting forces , it is possible to imagine that star - like compact objects can be formed .",
    "whatever the mechanisms of forming such objects , one should make sure that they do not violate the limits imposed by the macho  @xcite and eros  @xcite experiments .",
    "based on the microlensing technique , these experiments claimed that less than @xmath3 of dm can be in the form of compact objects between the mass range @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the solar mass .",
    "the possibility of stars made of dm has been studied before in the context of annihilating dm forming dark stars in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "it has been also studied in the context of hybrid compact stars made of baryonic and dm  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "neutron stars and white dwarfs include a significant amount of dm in their interior modifying thus the equation of state of the star .",
    "furthermore the possibility of black hole formation from strongly self - interacting components of dm was studied recently in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the possibility that asymmetric dm with self - interactions appropriate for solving the core vs cusp problem , the  satellite problem \" and the  too big to fail problem \" forms star - like compact objects .",
    "asymmetric dm  @xcite has become an attractive alternative to thermally produced dm not only because it can relate theories beyond the standard model to dm , but because it can also provide a link between baryogenesis and dark - genesis . for recent reviews on asymmetric",
    "dm see  @xcite .",
    "we are going to assume that the self - interactions are yukawa - type and can be either attractive ( mediated by a scalar @xmath1 ) or repulsive ( mediated by a vector boson @xmath6 ) . upon these assumptions ,",
    "we study the stability of dark stars formed by asymmetric fermionic dm .",
    "we solve the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation and study the hydrostatic equilibrium of these compact objects .",
    "we find their density profile , the mass vs radius relation as well as the chandrasekhar mass , i.e. the maximum mass where these objects are stable .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section ii we present the equation of state for dm with self - interactions . in section iii",
    "we show the relevant parameter phase space of self - interactions that solve the problems of ccdm we have mentioned earlier . in section",
    "iv we present the equations for the hydrostatic equilibrium of the dark stars . in section",
    "v we use a simplified newtonian analysis to get a first understanding of the problem , while we present the full relativistic results in section vi .",
    "we conclude in section vii .    throughout this paper",
    "we use natural units @xmath7 , and define the planck mass as @xmath8 .",
    "as we mentioned we assume that dm is of asymmetric type and fermionic .",
    "we also assume that dm self - interactions are mediated by @xmath1 via a yukawa coupling of the form @xmath9 ( in case of attractive interactions ) where @xmath10 is the dm particle and @xmath11 is the yukawa coupling constant or @xmath12 ( in case of repulsive interactions ) .",
    "we wish to obtain the equation of state of dm under the aforementioned assumptions .",
    "the energy density of dm particles @xmath13 consists of two components @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the kinetic energy density , and yukawa potential energy respectively .",
    "the pressure of the system is  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number density of dm particles .",
    "the pressure related to the kinetic energy @xmath19 in the non - relativistic ( @xmath20 ) or relativistic ( @xmath21 ) limits takes the simple form of a polytrope @xmath22 , where @xmath23 equals @xmath24 or @xmath25 for the non - relativistic and relativistic case respectively .",
    "we choose to work with the full relativistic dispersion @xmath26 .",
    "if we assume that the temperature of dm particles is much smaller than their fermi energy , i.e. we effectively take the limit @xmath27 , the number density , kinetic energy density and the corresponding pressure are given by @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    where the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined as + @xmath33\\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath34\\right\\}. \\label{7}\\ ] ] @xmath35 is a measure of how relativistic the particles are , and @xmath36 is the spin multiplicity .",
    "the yukawa potential between two particles is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass of the mediator , @xmath39 is the separation between the particles and @xmath40 is the coupling to the dark mediator . in order to find the yukawa potential energy of the entire system we have in principle to sum over all pairs of dm particles , which we approximate as an integration over volume elements .",
    "@xmath41 in the case where the radius of the star satisfies @xmath42 ( i.e. the potential is short range ) , it is a reasonable approximation to integrate the volume up to infinity ( instead of the volume of the star ) .",
    "this leads to the following yukawa energy density @xmath43 this estimate for the yukawa energy density gives us the final expressions for @xmath44 and @xmath13 :    @xmath45    since neither equation can be inverted analytically , we must work with two equations of state , and have an implicit relation between @xmath44 and @xmath13 .",
    "dm particles in the attractive scenario ( corresponding to the minus sign in the yukawa contribution ) can not become arbitrarily relativistic , since the pressure and density must be positive .",
    "the positiveness of pressure and density give an upper bound on @xmath46 .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , dm self - interactions within the range @xmath47 @xmath48/g can solve the problematic issues of ccdm , while astrophysical constraints limit these interactions between @xmath49 @xmath48/g .",
    "following  @xcite , in order to determine the parameter space of dm and mediator masses ( for a given coupling ) that lies in the aforementioned range , we introduce the transfer cross section @xmath50 .",
    "we use a typical value of @xmath51 km / s for the average velocity of dm in a dwarf galaxy , and we estimate the velocity averaged cross section as @xmath52    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we studied the possibility that fermionic asymmetric dm can form stars , with self - interactions that can solve well standing problems of the ccdm paradigm .",
    "we solved the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation and we derived mass vs radius relations for these stars for both attractive and repulsive dm self - interactions for a range of dm and mediator masses .",
    "we also derived upper mass limits for these objects and we studied the hydrostatic stability of the star profiles we examined .",
    "one issue of fundamental importance that we plan to address in future work is related to the question of how these stars form in the first place .",
    "there are several possibilities where such a scenario can be visualized .",
    "one possibility is the creation of high dm density regions due to adiabatic contraction , caused by baryons  @xcite ( see also discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is the existence of a subdominant strongly interacting dm component that consists the seed for the gravitational collapse of parts of the dm halo via a gravothermal mechanism  @xcite . in this case",
    "dm self - interactions can lead to a collapse due to the fact that dm - dm collisions can send one of the two particles to a deeper gravitational potential while the second one leaves the area subtracting thus energy from the system that continues until an instability is established . as it has been discussed in  @xcite",
    ", the gravothermal mechanism leads to either gravitational collapse if the dm - dm forces are short range , or to formation of binary systems in case of long range interactions . in our case ,",
    "the dm - dm interactions are short range because they are mediated by the massive particle @xmath1 , ( or @xmath6 ) and therefore the instability leads to formation of dm asymmetric stars .",
    "another possibility is the capture of a significant amount of dm particles by a supermassive star . after the collapse of the star and the supernova explosion , and",
    "since dm particles can not be blown away in significant amounts by the supernova , a pure dm star or a mixed star with significant amount of baryons can be formed  @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize here that all these possibilities do not lead to a total collapse of the whole dm population but rather of a small fraction of it . in view of this",
    ", one should not worry for star profiles we present here in the case of repulsive interactions that are within the range of @xmath53 constrained by the macho  @xcite and eros microlensing observations  @xcite , simply because these stars do not comprise the whole dm density .",
    "another issue we would like to leave out for future work is the discovery signatures for this type of dark stars .",
    "apart from gravitational lensing that can in principle discover objects like this based on the spacetime distortion that their presence can cause , other types of direct signals can exist .",
    "if dm communicates with the standard model via some portal , e.g. kinetic mixing between the photon and a dark photon , faint photon luminosity should be expected from these stars . additionally ,",
    "as we pointed out , for a large range of our parameters , the radius of these stars can be significantly smaller than that of a regular neutron star .",
    "this means that asymmetric dark stars can rotate faster than regular neutron stars .",
    "pure dark stars made of dm particles that interact with the standard model particles through some portal , or mixed stars can appear as fast rotating pulsars .",
    "rotational frequencies below millisecond are hard to be explained by a regular neutron star .",
    "an example of such a case is xte j1739 - 285 , which allegedly rotates with a frequency of 1122hz @xcite .",
    "any odd looking neutron star is a potential candidate for an asymmetric dark star",
    ".    we should mention that for a dark star that has collapsed to a black hole with a mass below @xmath54 , evaporation of the black hole via hawking radiation takes place within the age of the universe .",
    "although additional constraints exist  @xcite , there is still a possibility for observing the spectrum of an evaporating black hole in the sky .",
    "finally we should mention ( as one can easily estimate ) that in order for a dark star to collide with the earth during earth s lifetime of @xmath55 years , the dark star mass must be @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the local dm density , @xmath58 is the radius of the earth , and @xmath59 the velocity dispersion of dm .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter_to_chandra ] that @xmath60tev dm with attractive interactions and a coupling of @xmath61 can in fact give dark stars below that mass , making it possible for such a dark star to have collided with the earth in the past .",
