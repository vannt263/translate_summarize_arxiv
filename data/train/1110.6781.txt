    "the spin pumping by precessing magnetization is a phenomenon where the moving magnetization of a single ferromagnetic layer , driven by microwave radiation under the ferromagnetic resonance conditions ( fmr ) , emits spin current into adjacent normal metal layers .",
    "@xcite the emitted spin current is _ pure _",
    "@xcite in the sense that it is not accompanied by any net charge flux .",
    "this effect is termed `` pumping '' because it happens in the absence of any dc bias voltage , and together with closely related adiabatic quantum pumping of charge  @xcite or spin  @xcite observed in quantum dots , falls in the category of problems where an open quantum system ( i.e. , a finite many - particle system in contact with particle reservoirs ) is exposed to time - dependent periodic externals fields .",
    "since angular momentum loss carried by emitted pure spin current adds extrinsic contribution to gilbert damping , spin pumping has initially been observed  @xcite as an increased broadening of fmr spectra upon switching from a single ferromagnet ( f ) layer to f@xmath0n multilayers ( n - normal metal ) .",
    "therefore , it is also an essential ingredient to understand  @xcite critical current switching in experiments  @xcite on spin - transfer - torque - driven magnetization dynamics .",
    "in fact , spin pumping can also be viewed as the onsager reciprocal phenomenon  @xcite of spin - transfer torque  @xcite ( stt ) in which spin current of large enough density injected into a ferromagnetic layer either switches its magnetization from one static configuration to another or generates a dynamical situation with steady - state precessing magnetization .",
    "recent vigorous experimental efforts have focused on the direct detection of pure spin current generated by coherent macrospin precession in both ferromagnetic metals  @xcite and insulators  @xcite by converting it into dc voltage signal .",
    "for example , the experimental techniques employed for this purpose include the inverse spin hall effect  @xcite or the second static f layer as detector within a magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) ,  @xcite as well as the precessing f layer itself which can generate voltage  @xcite at the f@xmath0n interface by detecting the backflow spin current ( due to spin accumulation  @xcite driven by pumping into the n layers thinner than the spin - diffusion length ) .",
    "the origin of the voltage signal of spin pumping in f@xmath0i@xmath0f mtjs can be easily understood  @xcite as a two step process : ( 1 ) the magnetization dynamics of the left f layer pumps pure spin current across the tunnel barrier ( i - insulator ) ; ( 2 ) the pumped spin current is then filtered by the analyzing right f layer whose magnetization is static .",
    "this generates charge current or , equivalently , dc pumping voltage in an open circuit .",
    "@xcite this voltage is proportional to the frequency @xmath1 of microwaves due to adiabatic nature of pumping ( in the adiabatic regime , formally @xmath2 since energy of microwave photons @xmath3 is smaller than other relevant energy scales in ferromagnetic solids ) .    on the other hand , surprisingly large voltage signal observed  @xcite in f@xmath0i@xmath0n semi - mtjs , which do not contain the second analyzing f layer , has remained unexplained in virtually all recent theories  @xcite of spin pumping in mtjs .",
    "some of these theories  @xcite actually predict tiny voltage signal which being non - adiabatic @xmath4 is the second - order effect .",
    "also , there exists several orders of magnitude discrepancy between underestimated voltage signal of spin pumping in f@xmath0i@xmath0f mtjs obtained in the scattering theory ,  @xcite experimental data ,  @xcite and overestimated voltage signal obtained in the rotating frame approach  @xcite or the tunneling hamiltonian formalism combined with semiclassical modeling of the interplay of spin diffusion and self - consistent screening around interfaces .",
    "@xcite this can be traced to different device setups where scattering approach was applied to mtjs assuming zero  @xcite spin accumulation in the f layers modeled as semi - infinite leads ( justified through assumption that spin - flip rate in f is larger than the tunnel rate ) , while unrealistically large bulk  @xcite or interfacial  @xcite spin accumulation appears in the other two approaches .",
    "the mtjs employed in spin pumping experiments  @xcite contain f layers of nanoscale thickness whose short spin - diffusion length  @xcite can be modeled by sufficiently strong extrinsic spin - orbit scattering .",
    "most importantly , the very recent experiments  @xcite have unveiled a possibility of strong rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) at the f@xmath0i interface due to structural inversion asymmetry of the multilayered device within which such interfaces reside ( e.g. , rashba soc was detected in n@xmath0f@xmath0i multilayers , but not in the n@xmath0f@xmath0n ones  @xcite ) .",
    "however , socs have been traditionally neglected in a variety of approaches to spin and charge pumping by magnetization dynamics .",
    "@xcite the socs in the bulk or on the surface of ferromagnetic materials play crucial role in other phenomena , such as the anomalous hall effect  @xcite or the tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance  @xcite ( tamr ) .",
    "moreover , the study of the interplay between soc and stt has been recently initiated  @xcite through theoretical proposals  @xcite and experimental realizations  @xcite that exploit socs for stt - driven magnetization reversal of a single f layer with greatly reduced critical current required when compared to traditional spin valves or mtjs with two non - collinear magnetizations .",
    "@xcite    in the `` standard model ''",
    "@xcite of spin pumping in magnetic multilayers containing many  @xcite f and n layers , the magnitude of pumped spin current by f@xmath0n interfaces is computed quantum - mechanically via the brouwer scattering formula  @xcite which then serves as the boundary condition for the spin - diffusion equation  @xcite or enters into the so - called circuit theory  @xcite where device is split into nodes of characteristic size smaller than the spin - diffusion length .",
    "thus , in these frameworks socs enter only phenomenologically through finite spin - diffusion length ( a spin can be flipped by soc and magnetic impurities in n or f layers , as well as by magnon scattering in the f layers ) .",
    "however , these approaches are not applicable to mtjs since the spin accumulation is not well - defined in the insulating barrier .",
    "@xcite moreover , even the magnitude of pumped current can not be obtained from the `` standard model '' formula ,  @xcite governed by the interfacial spin - mixing conductance  @xcite @xmath5 , when _ strong soc is present immediately at the interface _ which renders @xmath5 an ill - defined quantity .",
    "the recent alternative description  @xcite of spin pumping in f@xmath0n multilayers , based on nonequilibrium green function ( negf ) expressions for the local spin and charge current densities , has encompassed both the earlier considered  @xcite nonlocal diffusion of the spin accumulation at the f@xmath0n interface generated by magnetization precession and the effective field described by the `` standard model '' ( where spin accumulation does not build at the interface since spin - flip relaxation rate is assumed to be sufficiently larger than the spin injection rate ) .",
    "however , this framework  @xcite has treated socs only in the n layer away from the precessing f layer in order to analyze how each of these two pumped spin currents can be converted into charge current by the inverse spin hall effect due to the extrinsic or intrinsic socs .",
    "that is , in this theory socs are not essential for the discussion of spin pumping effect itself .",
    "we note that other groups have also recently identified the importance of adding socs explicitly into the description of spin and charge pumping by magnetization dynamics .",
    "for example , a generalized scattering theory of adiabatic charge pumping by a single precessing f layer within n@xmath0f@xmath0n junctions containing socs has been formulated in ref .  . also , the pumping of current of magnetic monopoles and the associated ( via ampre law ) charge current flowing in the plane of the rashba so - coupled interface ( rather than perpendicular to it as is the focus of our study ) between the precessing f layer and a nonmagnetic layer has been predicted in ref .  .",
    "i@xmath0f mtj and ( b ) f@xmath0i@xmath0n semi - mtj with precessing magnetization of a single f layer are modeled on a simple cubic finite - size tight - binding lattice attached to semi - infinite ideal ( disorder and interaction free ) n leads .",
    "the thicknesses of the ferromagnetic layers and thin insulating barrier is measured using the number of atomic monolayers @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . for example , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the illustration , while in the actual calculations we use @xmath10 and @xmath11 monolayers of cross section @xmath12 lattice sites .",
    "the interfacial rashba soc due to structural inversion asymmetry of the junction is included in the last monolayer of the f slab that is in direct contact with the tunnel barrier i. the f layers can also include disorder modeled as a random on - site potential and the corresponding extrinsic soc , while binary alloy disorder in the i layer models alo@xmath13-type tunnel barrier . ]    here we develop a negf - based quantum transport theory of spin current pumping , its propagation , and conversion into electrically measurable signals in f@xmath0i@xmath0f and f@xmath0i@xmath0n junctions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the junctions are described by the microscopic time - dependent ( due to precessing magnetization of one of the f layers ) hamiltonian which is tailored to take into account nanoscale thickness of f layers within which we include terms describing disorder and extrinsic soc in the f layers , as well as possibly strong rashba soc at the f@xmath0i interfaces .",
    "our theory starts from the equations of motion generated by such hamiltonian for negfs which depend on two time variables , and then finds a computationally efficient solution to such equations which physically describes processes where a specific number of microwave photons is absorbed or emitted by propagating electrons in the course of pumping .",
    "this solution for time - dependent negfs allows us to obtain time - averaged total charge current in the n leads of the junctions shown in fig .  [ fig : setup ] or the corresponding dc pumping voltage in the corresponding open circuits .",
    "the formulas which we derive for pumped currents are also applicable to any problem where a quantum - mechanical system is exposed to periodic time - dependent external field , independently of its frequency ( i.e. , including both adiabatic and non - adiabatic regimes ) or amplitude ( i.e. , including both perturbative and non - perturbative regimes ) , as long as electron - electron , electron - phonon and electron - magnon interactions can be neglected .",

    "[ fig : fano ] ) is reached . at first site , this initial increase of @xmath277 with increasing disorder is counterintuitive , even though conductance also decreases with disorder , since pumped current appears to be increasing with @xmath44 .",
    "however , it can be explained qualitatively as being due to random electron scattering in real space which prolongs the average time an electron remains in the left f layer where it can interact with photons of the microwave pumping field .",

    "our unified quantum transport treatment of spin pumping [ fig .",

    "we emphasize that our fully quantum - mechanical treatment of the conduction electrons is necessary to understand such interplay of spin pumping , spin accumulation around interfaces  @xcite and spin diffusion in mtjs since conventional approach  @xcite developed for f@xmath0n multilayers , where pumping is treated quantum - mechanically while subsequent propagation of spins and charges is described semiclassically using phenomenological mean free path and spin - diffusion length , is inapplicable to systems containing tunnel barriers where spin accumulation is not well - defined .",
    "we have derived an exact and efficient for computational implementations solution to the equations of motion for the double - time - fourier - transformed negfs in the presence of time - periodic external potential . unlike continued fractions solution  @xcite for the same equations , which is often applied to problems of spin  @xcite and charge pumping  @xcite by computing only a finite number of continued fractions while assuming that the amplitude of time - periodic external potential is small , our formulas for pumped charge eq .",

    "this fully quantum - mechanical treatment of pumping processes and subsequent propagation of electrons is applied to the problem of charge pumping by precessing magnetization in the single f layer of f@xmath0i@xmath0n semi - mtj or f@xmath0i@xmath0f conventional mtj in the presence of intrinsic rashba soc at the f@xmath0i interface .",
    "the non - zero interfacial rashba soc , located  @xcite within the edge monolayer of the precessing f in contact with the tunnel barrier i , generates non - zero dc pumping voltage in f@xmath0i@xmath0n semi - mtj at the adiabatic level ( i.e. , pumping voltage is proportional to the microwave frequency @xmath229 ) .",
    "this could explain observations of voltage signal with such properties in the recent experiments  @xcite on microwave - driven f@xmath0i@xmath0n semi - mtjs where previously formulated theories  @xcite have found only a very small non - adiabatic ( @xmath293 ) voltage signal .",
    "we further predict a _ unique signature _ of this charge pumping phenomenon  the pumped charge current changes sign ( @xmath294 for small @xmath39 ) as the function of the precession cone angle @xmath20 so that measuring the corresponding dc pumping voltage ( @xmath295 for small @xmath39 ) would confirm our prediction .",
    "besides offering quantitative description of charge and spin pumping processes , our solution for negfs whose two energy arguments are connected by the floquet theorem describing multiphoton emission and absorption processes also provides new physical insights : ( _ i _ ) in the absence of socs , emission or absorption of _ one photon _ is sufficient to match the exact solution in the rotating frame ;  @xcite ( _ ii _ ) in the presence of rashba soc , exchange of up to ten photons is required to reach asymptotic value of the pumped currents . nevertheless , this asymptotic value is only about 10% larger than the value obtained using just one photon processes in the presence of socs .",
    "we also find that static disorder can increase the dc pumping voltage in f@xmath0i@xmath0f mtjs with finite thickness f layers in the quasiballistic transport regime where scattered electrons spend more time within the precessing f layer to interact with microwave photons .",
    "the extrinsic soc determined by the impurity potential responsible for the diffusive transport regime causes spin relaxation which ultimately diminishes the pumping voltage in f@xmath0i@xmath0f mtjs to zero when the spin - diffusion length is about five times shorter than the thickness of the f layers .",
