    "a belief in the influence of the built environment on humans was common in architectural and urban thinking for centuries .",
    "cities generate more interactions with more people than rural areas because they are central places of trade that benefit those who live there .",
    "people moved to cities because they intuitively perceived the advantages of urban life .",
    "city residence brought freedom from customary rural obligations to lord , community , or state and converted a compact space pattern into a pattern of relationships by constraining mutual proximity between people .",
    "spatial organization of a place has an extremely important effect on the way people move through spaces and meet other people by chance , @xcite .",
    "compact neighborhoods can foster casual social interactions among neighbors , while creating barriers to interaction with people outside a neighborhood .",
    "spatial configuration promotes peoples encounters as well as making it possible for them to avoid each other , shaping social patterns , @xcite .    the phenomenon of clustering of minorities , especially that of newly arrived immigrants , is well documented since the work of @xcite ( the reference appears in @xcite ) .",
    "clustering is considering to be beneficial for mutual support and for the sustenance of cultural and religious activities .",
    "at the same time , clustering and the subsequent physical segregation of minority groups would cause their economic marginalization .",
    "the study of london s change over 100 years performed by @xcite has indicated that the creation of poverty areas is a spatial process : by looking at the distribution of poverty at the street , it is possible to find a relationship between spatial segregation and poverty .",
    "the patterns of mortality in london studied over the past century by @xcite show that the areas of persistence of poverty can not be explained other than by an underlying spatial effect .",
    "urban planning is recognized to play a crucial position in the development of sustainable cities .",
    "the essentially fast growth of cities in the last decades urgently calls for a profound insight into the common principles stirring the structure of urban development all over the world .",
    "sociologists think that isolation worsens an area s economic prospects by reducing opportunities for commerce , and engenders a sense of isolation in inhabitants , both of which can fuel poverty and crime .",
    "urban planners and governments have often failed to take such isolation into account when shaping the city landscape , not least because isolation can sometimes be difficult to quantify in the complex fabric of a major city .",
    "the source of such a difficulty is profound : while humans live and act in euclidean space which they percept visually as affine space and which is present in them as a mental form , a complex network of interconnected spaces of movements that constitutes a spatial urban pattern does not possess the structure of euclidean space . in another circumstance we spoke of fishes : they know nothing either of what the sea , or a lake , or a river might really be and only know fluid as if it were air around them . while in a complex built environment , humans have no sensation of it , but need time to construct its `` affine representation '' so they can understand and store it in their spatial memory",
    ". therefore , human behaviors in complex environments result from a long learning process and the planning of movements within them . in @xcite",
    ", we suggested that random walks can help us to find such an `` affine representation '' of the built environment , giving us a leap outside our euclidean `` aquatic surface '' and opening up and granting us the sensation of new space .    while travelling in the city ,",
    "our primary interest is often in finding the best route from one place to another .",
    "since the way - finding process is a purposive , directed , and motivated activity @xcite , the shortest route is not necessary the best one .",
    "if an origin and a destination are not directly connected by a continuous path , wayfinding may include search and exploration actions for which it may be crucial to recognize juxtaposed and distant landmarks , to determine turn angles and directions of movement , and eventually to embed the route in some large reference frame .",
    "it is well known that the conceptual representations of space in humans do not bear a one - to - one correspondence with actual physical space .",
    "the process of integration of the local affine models of individual places into the entire cognitive map of the urban area network is very complicated and falls largely within the domain of cognitive science and psychology , but nevertheless the specification of what may be recovered from spatial memory can be considered as a problem of mathematics ",
    "`` the limits of human perception coincide with mathematically plausible solutions '' , @xcite . supposing the inherent mobility of humans and alikeness of their spatial perception aptitudes",
    ", one might argue that nearly all people experiencing the city would agree in their judgments on the total number of individual locations in that , in identification of the borders of these locations , and their interconnections .",
    "in other words , we assume that spatial experience in humans intervening in the city may be organized in the form of a universally acceptable network .",
    "well - known and frequently travelled path segments provide linear anchors for certain city districts and neighborhoods that helps to organize collections of spatial models for the individual locations into a configuration representing the mental image of the entire city . in our study , we assume that the frequently travelled routes are nothing else but the `` projective invariants '' of the given layout of streets and squares in the city  the function of its geometrical configuration , which remains invariant whatever origin - destination route is considered .",
    "the arbitrary linear transformations of the geometrical configuration with respect to which a certain property remains invariant constitute the generalized affine transformations .",
    "it is intuitively clear that if the spatial configuration of the city is represented by a regular graph , where each location represented by a vertex has the same number of neighbors , in absence of other local landmarks , all paths would be equally probably followed by travelers .",
    "no linear anchors are possible in such an urban pattern which could stimulate spatial apprehension . however",
    ", if the spatial graph of the city is far from being regular , then a configuration disparity of different places in the city would result in that some of them may be visited by travelers more often than others .    in the following sections of our work",
    ", we study the problem of isolation in cities with the use of random walks that provide us with an effective tool for the detailed structural analysis of connected undirected graphs exposing their symmetries , @xcite .",
    "in traditional urban researches , the dynamics of an urban pattern come from the landmasses , the physical aggregates of buildings delivering place for people and their activity .",
    "the relationships between certain components of the urban texture are often measured along streets and routes considered as edges of a planar graph , while the traffic end points and street junctions are treated as nodes .",
    "such a primary graph representation of urban networks is grounded on relations between junctions through the segments of streets .",
    "the usual city map based on euclidean geometry can be considered as an example of primary city graphs .    in space syntax theory ( see @xcite ) , built environments are treated as systems of spaces of vision subjected to a configuration analysis .",
    "being irrelevant to the physical distances , spatial graphs representing the urban environments are removed from the physical space .",
    "it has been demonstrated in multiple experiments that spatial perception shapes peoples understanding of how a place is organized and eventually determines the pattern of local movement , @xcite .",
    "the aim of the space syntax study is to estimate the relative proximity between different locations and to associate these distances to the densities of human activity along the links connecting them , @xcite .",
    "the surprising accuracy of predictions of human behavior in cities based on the purely topological analysis of different urban street layouts within the space syntax approach attracts meticulous attention @xcite .",
    "the decomposition of urban spatial networks into the complete sets of intersecting open spaces can be based on a number of different principles . in @xcite , while identifying a street over a plurality of routes on a city map , the named - street approach has been used , in which two different arcs of the primary city network were assigned to the same identification number ( i d ) provided they share the same street name .    in the present chapter ,",
    "we take a `` named - streets''-oriented point of view on the decomposition of urban spatial networks into the complete sets of intersecting open spaces following our previous works @xcite .",
    "being interested in the statistics of random walks defined on spatial networks of urban patterns , we assign an individual street i d code to each continuous segment of a street .",
    "the spatial graph of urban environment is then constructed by mapping all edges ( segments of streets ) of the city map shared the same street i d into nodes and all intersections among each pair of edges of the primary graph into the edges of the secondary graph connecting the corresponding nodes .    although graphs are usually shown diagrammatically , they can also be represented as matrices .",
    "the major advantage of matrix representation is that then the analysis of graph structure can be performed using well known operations on matrices . for each graph",
    ", there exists a unique adjacency matrix ( up to permuting rows and columns ) which is not the adjacency matrix of any other graph .",
    "if we assume that the spatial graph of the city is simple ( i.e. , it contains neither loops , nor multiple edges ) , the adjacency matrix is a @xmath0-matrix with zeros on its diagonal : @xmath1 if the graph is undirected , the adjacency matrix is symmetric , @xmath2 . if the graph contains twins nodes , the correspondent rows and columns of @xmath3 are identical .",
    "a finite connected undirected graph can be seen as a _",
    "discrete time dynamical system _ possessing a finite number of states ( nodes ) @xcite .",
    "the behavior of such a dynamical system can be studied by means of a transfer operator which describes the time evolution of distributions in phase space .",
    "the transfer operator can be represented by a stochastic matrix determining a discrete time random walk on the graph in which a walker picks at each node between the various available edges with equal probability .",
    "an obvious benefit of the approach based on random walks to graph theory is that the relations between individual nodes and subgraphs acquire a precise quantitative probabilistic description that enables us to attack applied problems which could not even be started otherwise . given a finite connected undirected graph @xmath4 let us consider a transformation @xmath5 mapping any subset of nodes @xmath6 into the set of their direct neighbors , @xmath7 we denote the result of @xmath8 consequent applications of @xmath9 to @xmath6 as @xmath10 .",
    "the iteration of the map @xmath9 leads to a study of possible paths in the graph @xmath11 beginning at @xmath12 however , we rather discuss the time evolution of smooth functions under iteration , than the individual trajectories @xmath13 given a discrete _ density function _",

    "the vector @xmath36 satisfies the condition of detailed balance , @xmath37 from which it follows that a random walk defined on an undirected graph is time reversible : it is also a random walk if considered backward , and it is not possible to determine , given the walker at a number of nodes in time after running the walk , which state came first and which state arrived later .",

    "clustering and the subsequent physical segregation of minority groups would cause their economic marginalization . the spatial analysis of the immigrant quarters @xcite and the study of london s changes over 100 years @xcite shows that they were significantly more segregated from the neighboring areas , in particular , the number of street turning away from the quarters to the city centers were found to be less than in the other inner - city areas being usually socially barricaded by railways , canals and industries .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that space structure and its impact on movement are critical to the link between the built environment and its social functioning .",
    "spatial structures creating a local situation in which there is no relation between movements inside the spatial pattern and outside it and the lack of natural space occupancy become associated with the social misuse of the structurally abandoned spaces .    we have analyzed the first - passage times to individual canals in the spatial graph of the canal network in venice . the distribution of numbers of canals over the range of the first ",
    "passage time values is represented by a histogram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3_urban].left .",
    "the height of each bar in the histogram is proportional to the number of canals in the canal network of venice for which the first ",
    "passage times fall into the disjoint intervals ( known as bins ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the grand canal , the giant giudecca canal and the venetian lagoon are the most connected . in contrast , the venetian ghetto ( see fig .  [",
    "fig3_urban].right )  jumped out as by far the most isolated , despite being apparently well connected to the rest of the city  on average , it took 300 random steps to reach , far more than the average of 100 steps for other places in venice .",
    "the ghetto was created in march 1516 to separate jews from the christian majority of venice .",
    "it persisted until 1797 , when napoleon conquered the city and demolished the ghetto s gates .",
    "now it is abandoned .",
    "the notion of isolation acquires the statistical interpretation by means of random walks .",
    "the first - passage times in the city vary strongly from location to location .",
    "those places characterized by the shortest first - passage times are easy to reach while very many random steps would be required in order to get into a statistically isolated site .",
    "being a global characteristic of a node in the graph , the first - passage time assigns absolute scores to all nodes based on the probability of paths they provide for random walkers .",
    "the first - passage time can therefore be considered as a natural statistical centrality measure of the node within the graph , @xcite .    a visual pattern displayed on fig .  [ fig2_isolation",
    "] represents the pattern of structural isolation ( quantified by the first - passage times ) in manhattan ( darker color corresponds to longer first - passage times ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spatial distribution of isolation in the urban pattern of manhattan ( fig .",
    "[ fig2_isolation ] ) shows a qualitative agreement with the map of the tax assessment value of the land in manhattan reported by b. rankin ( 2006 ) in the framework of the radical cartography project being practically a negative image of that .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     the inhospitable isolation of these places can be estimated numerically , however people rather percept it intuitively .",
    "although the actual criminal rate in bielefeld appears to be relatively low , many pulp fiction authors found the city a suitable place for their criminal stories that indeed recalls us the sustained satirical internet - myth of the _ bielefeld verschwrung _ ( bielefeld conspiracy ) . in spite of all efforts to subsidize development and publicity for bielefeld by the city council",
    ", it still has a solid reputation for obscurity .",
    "our analysis shows that the city of bielefeld consists of three structurally different components loosely tied together by just a few principal routes .",
    "being founded in 1214 by hermann iv , the count of ravensberg , the compact city guarded a pass crossing the teutoburger forest . in 1847 , the new cologne - minden railway had passed through bielefeld establishing the new urban development apart from the historical core of the major city - the bahnhofsviertel governed mostly by the linear structure of the rail road .",
    "finally , during the industrial revolution , the modern city quarters had been constructed by the end of the 19th century .",
    "these city districts built in accordance with different development principles and in different historical epochs are strikingly dissimilar in structure .",
    "walkers in our model were mostly confined in each city domain experiencing difficulty while alternating that . not surprisingly , most germans have a vague image of the city in their heads .",
    "the threefold structure of bielefeld would make the city center extremely vulnerable to proliferation of growth problems .",
    "we assumed that spatial experience in humans intervening in the city may be organized in the form of a universally acceptable network .",
    "we also assumed that the frequently travelled routes are nothing else but the `` projective invariants '' of the given layout of streets and squares in the city  the function of its geometrical configuration , which remains invariant whatever origin - destination route is considered .",
    "basing on these two assumptions , we have developed a method that allows to capture a neighborhood s inaccessibility .",
    "any finite undirected graph can be interpreted as a discrete time dynamical system with a finite number of states .",
    "the temporal evolution of such a dynamical system is described by a `` dynamical law '' that maps vertices of the graph into other vertices and can be interpreted as the transition operator of random walks .",
    "the level of accessibility of nodes and subgraphs of undirected graphs can be estimated precisely in connection with random walks introduced on them .",
    "we have applied this method to the structural analysis of different cities .",
    "the main motivation of our work was to get an insight into the structure of human settlements that would improve the overall strategy of investments and planning and avoid the declining of cities as well as the many environmental problems .",
    "multiple increases in urban population that had occurred in europe at the beginning of the 20@xmath99 century have been among the decisive factors that changed the world .",
    "urban agglomerations had suffered from the co - morbid problems such as widespread poverty , high unemployment , and rapid changes in the racial composition of neighborhoods .",
    "riots and social revolutions have occurred in urban places in many european countries in part in response to deteriorated conditions of urban decay and fostered political regimes affecting immigrants and certain population groups _ de facto _ alleviating the burden of the haphazard urbanization by increasing its deadly price : tens of millions of people had emigrated from europe , but many more of them had died of starvation and epidemic diseases , or became victims of wars and political repressions .",
    "urbanization has been the dominant demographic trend in the entire world , during the last half century .",
    "although the intense process of urbanization is a proof of economic dynamism , clogged roads , dirty air , and deteriorating neighborhoods are fuelling a backlash against urbanization that nevertheless can not be stopped .",
    "the urban design decisions made today on the base of the us car - centered model , in cities of the developing world where car use is still low , will have an enormous impact on climate changes in the decades ahead .",
    "unsustainable pressure on resources causes the increasing loss of fertile lands through degradation and the dwindling amount of fresh water and food would trigger conflicts and result in mass migrations .",
    "migrations induce a dislocation and disconnection between the population and their ability to undertake traditional land use , @xcite .",
    "major metropolitan areas and the intensively growing urban agglomerations attract large numbers of immigrants with limited skills .",
    "many of them will end up a burden on the state , and perhaps become involved in criminal activity .",
    "the poor are urbanizing faster than the population as a whole , @xcite .",
    "global poverty is in flight becoming a primarily urban phenomenon in the developing world : about 70% of 2 bln new urban settlers in the next 30 years will live in slums , adding to 1 bln already there .",
    "the essential attention should be given to the cities in the developing world where the accumulated urban growth will be duplicated in the next 25 years .",
    "the fastest urbanization of poverty occurred in latin america , where the majority of the poor now live in urban areas .",
    "faults in urban planning , poverty , redlining , immigration restrictions and clustering of minorities dispersed over the spatially isolated pockets of streets trigger urban decay , a process by which a city falls into a state of disrepair .",
    "the speed and scale of urban growth require urgent global actions to help cities prepare for growth and to avoid them of being the future epicenters of poverty and human suffering .",
    "people of modern europe prefer to live in single - family houses and commute by automobile to work . in 10 years ( 1990 - 2000 )",
    ", low - density expansions of urban areas known as urban sprawl consumed more than 8,000 @xmath100 in europe , the entire territory of the state of luxembourg . residents of sprawling neighborhoods tend to emit more pollution per person and suffer more traffic fatalities .",
    "faults in planning of urban sprawl neighborhoods would force the structural focus of the city out from its historical center and trigger the process of degradation in that .",
    "together with severe environmental problems generated by the unlimited expansion of the city , the process of urban degradation creates dramatic economic and social implications , with negative effects on the urban economy .",
    "it is well known that degraded urban areas are less likely to attract investments , new enterprises and services , but become attractive for socially underprivileged groups because of a tendency of reduction house prices in the urban core .",
    "smart growth policies that concentrate the future urban development in the center of the city to avoid urban sprawl should be applied .    our last",
    "but not least remark is that sprawling suburbs in usa saw by far the greatest growth in their poor population and by 2008 had become home to the largest share of the nation s poor . between 2000 and 2008",
    ", sprawls in the us largest metro areas saw their poor population grow by 25 percent - almost five times faster than primary cities and well ahead of the growth seen in smaller metro areas and non - metropolitan communities .",
    "these trends are likely to continue in the wake of the latest downturn , given its toll on the faster pace of growth in suburban unemployment .    a combination of interrelated factors , including urban planning decisions , poverty , the development of freeways and railway lines , suburbanization , redlining",
    ", immigration restrictions would trigger urban decay , a process by which a city falls into a state of disrepair .",
