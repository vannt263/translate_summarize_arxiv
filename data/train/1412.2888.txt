    "we assume a scenario where , besides throughput considerations , reliability plays an important role .",
    "we therefore focus on the probability of communication failure as our main figure of merit  @xcite .",
    "different versions of have been proposed ( see  @xcite for the most recent review ) .",
    "all of them share a slotted structure borrowed from the original slotted aloha  @xcite and the use of successive interference cancellation .",

    "the buffers the received signal , decodes the packets from the slots with no collision and attempts to reconstruct the packets in collision exploiting the introduced redundancy .",
    "a packet that is reconstructed is subtracted from the buffered signal and the proceeds with another round of decoding .",
    "the analysis of is usually done assuming that a packet in a collision - free slot can be reliably decoded and the interference caused by a packet can be ideally subtracted if the packet is known . under these assumptions , the system can be viewed as a graph - based code operating over a .",
    "most papers on consider error - free transmission . here , we consider transmission over the  @xcite . the can be used to model packets that are erased due to a deep fade for a block fading channel in the large regime .",
    "it can also be used to model a network with random connectivity .",
    "the model allows us to use to predict the asymptotic performance of the system when the frame length tends to infinity .",
    "the typical performance exhibits a threshold behavior , i.e. , all users are reliably resolved if the number of users does not exceed a certain threshold .",
    "most of the work on focuses on optimizing the threshold .",
    "however , the performance in the finite frame length regime is more relevant in practice . similarly to codes , a finite frame length gives rise to an error floor due to stopping sets present in the graph  @xcite . for regular ,",
    "some simple approximations to predict the error floor were proposed in  @xcite . in this paper , we derive analytical expressions to predict the error floor for irregular  @xcite over the .",

    "moreover , we show that the asymptotic analysis using fails for systems operating over the .",
    "we consider @xmath0 users that transmit to the   over a shared medium .",
    "the communication takes place during a contention period called _ frame _ , consisting of @xmath1 slots of equal duration . using a properly designed physical layer , each user maps its message to a physical layer packet and then repeats it @xmath2 times ( @xmath2 is a random number chosen based on a predefined distribution ) in randomly chosen slots , as shown in  fig .  [",
    "fig : system_model ] .",
    "this setup can be viewed as repetition coding and such a user is called a degree-@xmath2 user .",
    "every packet contains pointers to its copies , so that , once a packet is successfully decoded , full information about the location of the copies is available .",
    "[ fig : system_model ]    the received signal at the in the @xmath3th slot is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a packet of the @xmath6th user , @xmath7 is the channel coefficient and @xmath8 is the set of users that transmit in the @xmath3th slot .",
    "we assume the channel coefficients to be independent across users and slots and identically distributed such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 is the probability of a packet erasure .",
    "we refer to such a channel as a .",
    "if the number of nonzero coefficients @xmath12 for @xmath13 is one , the @xmath3th slot is called a _ singleton _ slot .",
    "otherwise , we say that a collision occurs in the @xmath3th slot .    at first the decodes the packets in singleton slots and",
    "obtains the location of their copies . using data - aided methods , the channel coefficients corresponding to the copies",
    "are then estimated .",
    "after subtracting the interference caused by the identified copies , decoding proceeds until no further singleton slots are found .",
    "the also models the capture effect since a packet in the @xmath3th slot may be decoded even if @xmath14 .",
    "the system can be analyzed using the theory of codes on graphs over the .",

    "an edge connects the @xmath6th to the @xmath3th if @xmath13 and @xmath12 . for the example in  fig .",
    "[ fig : system_model ] , the corresponding bipartite graph is shown in  fig .  [ fig : system_model ] .",
    "a bipartite graph is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 represent the sets of , , and edges , respectively .",
    "the performance of the system greatly depends on the distribution that users use to choose the degree @xmath2 or , using graph terminology , on the degree distribution @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a dummy variable , @xmath21 is the probability of choosing degree @xmath2 , and @xmath22 is the maximum degree , which is often bounded due to implementation constraints , for instance , by eight in  @xcite .",

    "the key performance parameters are defined as follows .",
    "the channel load @xmath32 shows how `` busy '' the medium is .",

    "hence , the receives @xmath36 packets with probability @xmath37 .",
    "averaging over the degree distribution @xmath38 leads to the _ induced _ degree distribution @xmath39 observed by the @xmath40 which can be written similarly to  , where @xmath41 is the fraction of users of degree @xmath2 as observed by the .",
    "the can thus be analyzed by considering @xmath39 over a standard collision channel  @xcite .",
    "the main peculiarity of the induced distribution , not considered in the standard analysis , is that it contains all degrees up to @xmath22 , including zero and one .",
    "this implies that the exhibits an error floor , which is lowerbounded by @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the threshold , i.e. , the channel load below which the is zero when @xmath44 , predicted by is zero over a with @xmath43 for any distribution @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , devised in  @xcite does not correspond to the decoding algorithm for distributions with @xmath45 . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the induced distribution @xmath39 and the induced graph @xmath46 .    by construction features , similarly to the in coding theory , since users with different degrees are protected differently . the inherent is illustrated by dashed lines in  fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_results ] for @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as clearly seen from the figure , the higher the degree , the better the performance .",

    "the average is @xmath54    since packet erasures are accounted for in the induced distribution , the only source of errors in the considered model is harmful structures in the graph @xmath55 .",
    "when , e.g. , two degree-@xmath56 users transmit in the same slots ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : error_events ] ) , the will not be able to resolve them . such harmful structures are commonly referred to as _ stopping sets_. a subset of of non - zero degrees @xmath57 forms a stopping set if all neighbors of @xmath58 are connected to @xmath58 at least twice  @xcite .",
    "@xmath58 induces a graph , which , with a slight abuse of notation , is also referred to as stopping set and denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 can be described by its profile @xmath59 . for @xmath60 in  fig .",
    "[ fig : error_events ] , the graph profile is @xmath61 $ ] , where the number of zeros in the end depends on @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig : error_events ]    stopping sets are referred to as `` loops '' in  @xcite . however , stopping sets do not form a loop if degree-@xmath63 users are present , as in  fig .",
    "[ fig : error_events]. on the other hand , if there are no degree-@xmath63 users , all stopping sets create cycles ( or loops ) in the graph , as in  fig .",
    "[ fig : error_events]. length-@xmath64 cycles are the shortest cycles possible and are always avoided in properly designed codes . due to the randomly generated graph , however , length-@xmath64 cycles are intrinsic to .",
    "we denote the probability of a stopping set @xmath58 to occur by @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 be the set of all possible stopping sets .",
    "using a union bound argument , the number of unresolved degree-@xmath2 users can be upperbounded as @xmath67    the probability @xmath65 is in general difficult to evaluate . in the following ,",
    "we give an example to show how it can be approximated .",
    "consider @xmath68 in  fig .",
    "[ fig : error_events ] and assume a particular realization of @xmath69 so that @xmath70 .",
    "numerical results show that for low channel loads , the probability to observe exactly one stopping set @xmath68 is at least one order of magnitude larger than the probability of any other possible stopping set formed by degree-@xmath56 users ( including multiple @xmath68 ) to occur .",
    "we therefore assume that only one stopping set @xmath68 occurs .",
    "this also hints that @xmath68 is the most dominant among all stopping sets containing only degree-@xmath56 users .",
    "users of other degrees may transmit in the same slot as the users in @xmath68 .",
    "this may create a new larger stopping set , or these users may be successfully resolved and their interference subtracted .",
    "however , the users in @xmath68 will remain unresolved .",
    "each of the degree-@xmath56 users has @xmath71 possible combinations of slots for transmission .",
    "given that the number of slots is large enough for the realization of @xmath69 ( @xmath72 ) , we write @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 where the right - hand side of   is the probability of one stopping set @xmath68 to occur and is split into a product of two variables for future  use .    in the following ,",
    "we remove the dependency on @xmath69 from   in order to obtain @xmath76 .",
    "to do so , we simplify @xmath77 assuming that @xmath78 . by letting @xmath79 grow large , we obtain @xmath80 .",
    "the same result can be obtained setting @xmath81 to the minimal possible value , i.e. , two . to find @xmath76 , @xmath82 in   needs to be averaged over all @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 stands for the expectation over @xmath69 .    for a generic @xmath58 , generalizes to @xmath85 using   and the definition of the multinomial distribution in",
    ", @xmath86 can be calculated as @xmath87    we apply the reasoning above to all stopping sets and write @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the probability of the stopping set @xmath58 to occur in a graph with profile @xmath59 , and @xmath90 is the number of combinations to choose @xmath91 users out of @xmath92 users present in the graph @xmath69 for all degrees , averaged over @xmath69 .",
    "the numerical results presented later on justify the approximation in  .    identifying all",
    "stopping sets and calculating the corresponding @xmath89 in a systematic way is not possible in general . in practice ,",
    "distributions with large fractions of low - degree are most commonly used since they achieve high thresholds .",
    "for instance , the soliton distribution  @xcite , which asymptotically provides throughput arbitrarily close to one , has @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "if we constrain ourselves to the family of such distributions , i.e. , distributions with large fractions of degree-@xmath56 and degree-@xmath95 users , identifying the most dominant stopping sets becomes possible . by running extensive simulations for different distributions from the aforementioned family of distributions for @xmath96 , we determined the stopping sets that contribute the most to the error floor by estimating their relative frequencies .",
    "these stopping sets are shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : error_events ] , with @xmath97 note that constraining the set of the considered stopping sets turns the upper bound in   into an approximation .",

    "the for a degree-@xmath2 user ( from the user s perspective ) can be found as @xmath101 if @xmath102 and zero otherwise .",
    "when @xmath48 , it is easy to see from   that @xmath103 and from   that @xmath104 for all @xmath105 .",
    "we remark that calculating   is not required if we are interested in the average , i.e. , it can be calculated based on @xmath100 and @xmath39 as in  .",

    "this distribution was suggested in  @xcite as a distribution that provides low error floor .",
    "the dashed lines show the simulation results and the solid lines show the proposed analytical plr expression   based on the approximation  .",
    "the analytical predictions demonstrate good agreement with the simulation results for low to moderate channel loads .",
    "this justifies the approximation in   and the use of the stopping sets in  fig .",
    "[ fig : error_events ] . considering other stopping sets can improve the prediction for higher channel loads and would make it possible to predict the performance of users of higher degrees .",
    "however , as  fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_results ] suggests , the contribution of these users to the average is negligible , especially in the error floor region .",
