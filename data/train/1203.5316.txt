    "the curvaton mechanism @xcite is a much studied alternative to the standard inflationary paradigm for the origin of the observed primordial perturbations .",
    "the curvaton field is assumed to be light and subdominant during the inflation process and its contribution to the energy density is significant only moments before its decay .",
    "this allows the inflation potential to have more natural properties @xcite compared to the single field scenario while still leading to adiabatic perturbations consistent with the current observational data @xcite .",
    "reheating of the universe is an important part of the early universe cosmology ( for a review cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the curvaton scenario",
    "it is most often assumed that the curvaton field decays perturbatively into lighter degrees of freedom once the hubble parameter is of the order of curvaton decay width @xmath1 and thermalizes with the radiation that originates from the inflaton .",
    "it is however also possible that the universe reheated through a rapid and rather violent preheating process .",
    "this parametric resonance was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the curvaton scenario and the main conclusion was that in general it is quite similar to the preheating of the inflaton field . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was further found that the curvaton resonance can lead to very high levels non - gaussianity .",
    "the curvaton potential in most of these studies is assumed to be of a quadratic type . as was noted in refs .",
    "@xcite any deviations from this shape can lead to significant differences in the end results , especially in the level of generated non - gaussianity . whereas these studies were limited to the perturbative regime in the present paper",
    "we expand this analysis to the non - linear preheating process .",
    "we limit the potential function of the curvaton to the typical quadratic type with additional quartic self - interactions .",
    "we also assume that the curvaton field does not couple to other scalar fields in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will study this self - interacting curvaton scenario with classical fields and lattice simulations from two different perspectives .",
    "we will first concentrate on the thermalization of the curvaton field during the resonance process .",
    "we will compare the results to the preheating of inflaton that has been studied thoroughly in with analytical and numerical methods .",
    "after this we will concentrate on the calculation of generated non - gaussianity with the @xmath0 formalism @xcite .",
    "this mainly numerical study will be done with the recently published symplectic pycool program @xcite ( available from https://github.com/jtksai/pycool ) .",
    "we also use this paper to showcase the numerous post - processing functions included with the program .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the curvaton model and the equations of motion . in section",
    "iii we present the thermalization and non - gaussianity calculations and results .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section iv .",
    "we model the curvaton field with a simple polynomial potential function with quartic self - interactions @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the curvaton field and @xmath4 is the coupling constant of the curvaton self - interactions .",
    "following @xcite we will set the initial energy density of the homogeneous radiation component equal to the potential energy of the inflaton @xmath5 where the coupling constant @xmath6 is a free parameter and we set @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the reduced planck mass .",
    "the curvaton field is effectively massless during inflation and hence it is require that @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the value of the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "after the inflation ends the curvaton field stays almost constant until it starts to oscillate around its minimum when the hubble parameter has decreased close to the value of the effective mass of curvaton . in the usual perturbative analysis",
    "the field would then start to decay into lighter particles once the hubble parameter is roughly equal to the decay width of the curvaton . in this paper",
    "we are however more interested in the non - perturbative analysis meaning that the interaction terms in the potential function ( [ curv - pot ] ) now lead to the production of curvaton particles @xcite .",
    "the curvaton field is assumed to decay perturbatively only long after the resonance period is over .",
    "the closely related reheating process of a self - interacting inflaton field has been studied previously in refs .",
    "@xcite of which the last two use a similar interaction picture to this study .",
    "we will assume that the quartic term dominates the curvaton potential and hence initially we set @xmath11 .",
    "in the opposite case the reheating process does not happen and the curvaton field does not thermalize .    the creation of particles during this preheating has been studied extensively in @xcite in the case of massless inflation and we will cite the most relevant results here . the mode equation of the curvaton particles with wave number @xmath12 can be written in terms of a more general lam equation @xmath13 which is valid for @xmath14 type interaction terms where @xmath15 is another scalar field .",
    "this equation however reduces to the mode equation of the quartic self - interaction when @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we have here also defined @xmath17 , used prime to denote time derivative with respect to the scaled conformal time which is defined in terms of the physical time @xmath18 as @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the jacobi cosine function .",
    "we have also used a rescaled wave number @xmath21 , where the rescaled curvaton amplitude @xmath22 is measured at the end of inflation .",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 that will lead to production of particles can be read from the corresponding stability / instability chart that can be found for example in @xcite .",
    "we will now approximate the mode equation of the massive self - interacting curvaton particles with equation ( [ lame ] ) with @xmath16 and we will also neglect the mass term which we assume to be small compared to the interaction term at least during the early part of the evolution",
    ". it is now easy to see from the stability / instability chart that the curvaton particles are produced at a band close to a rescaled momentum value of @xmath25 which in terms of the comoving momentum reads @xmath26 this is the only momentum band and the other suitable momentum values correspond to single points @xcite .",
    "this resonant phase of particle production is followed by @xcite a period of rescattering of the coherent curvaton mode ( @xmath27 ) and the created particles leading to a formation of multiple peaks in the spectrum of the field close to the harmonic frequencies of @xmath28 . after this",
    "the system enters a regime of turbulent dynamics @xcite which is followed by a long period during which the field reaches the thermal state .",
    "we will solve the evolution of the system with a symplectic algorithm that is by design meant to conserve the energy of the system . instead of solving the euler - lagrange equations of motion we will instead use the hamiltonian equations that are split into explicitly integrable pieces .",

    "starting from the einstein - hilbert action and after some simple legendre transformations the hamiltonian function of the system can be derived .",

    "when integrating these equations we will first split them into explicitly integrable pieces and then use a suitable symplectic integrator .",
    "we use units where the reduced planck mass @xmath48 is set to one . we will also use a general mass @xmath49 to define the lattice , the initial radiation energy density and the time step @xmath50 . the physical time is measured in units of @xmath51 .",
    "we will use a conformal time step @xmath52 in the simulations and solve the evolution until @xmath53 .",
    "the size of the lattice is limited by requirement that @xmath54 the comoving horizon is larger than the comoving lattice at all times .",
    "otherwise the assumption that has been used when deriving equation ( [ eq : h ] ) that the metric is of the friedmann - robertson - walker form @xmath55 would have to be adjusted to include also metric perturbations .",
    "we used two different lattice sizes to run the simulations : the thermalization study was done with @xmath56 points whereas the non - gaussianity simulations were run on smaller @xmath57 lattices that are roughly 46 times faster to solve .",
    "we set the comoving edge of the lattice to be @xmath58 in the thermalization simulations meaning that the comoving momenta are in the range @xmath59 which we calculate with the effective wave number @xmath60 instead of the magnitude of the wave vector . in the non - gaussianity calculations with a smaller lattice size",
    "we are compelled to reduce either the infrared or the ultraviolet resolution of the simulation .",
    "simple numerical test runs show that the ultraviolet modes are more important for the evolution of the system to be consistent in these two cases .",
    "we have therefore used a comoving edge length @xmath61 meaning that the comoving momenta are in the range @xmath62 in the non - gaussianity results .",
    "the initial values for the curvaton field were chosen based on two criteria . in order for the quartic term to dominate in the potential function we simply set @xmath63",
    "we also want the momentum band where the particle creation happens , eq .",
    "( [ eq : part - band ] ) , to be inside the lattice meaning that the parameters should be chosen such that @xmath64 is neither too large nor too small .    with these criteria in mind we used the following values for the parameters : the mass of the curvaton",
    "is set to @xmath65 , initial curvaton field value @xmath66 , curvaton self - interaction strength @xmath67 , initial radiation density @xmath68 .",
    "the initial fractional energy density of the curvaton , @xmath69 , corresponding to these values is of order @xmath70 ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the momentum band where the particle creation happens is approximately at @xmath71 .",
    "previous studies of the thermalization process after preheating have used a number of different variables to study and to illustrate the different phases of this process .",
    "the comoving number density and the related number density spectra are certainly some of the most interesting ones to use .",
    "there have been however a number of different definitions and ways to calculate these variables leading to slightly different results while the overall picture of the thermalization process stays the same . in this study",
    "we use a definition for the number density @xmath72 that was previously used in latticeeasy @xcite .",
    "this is done by using conformal field values @xmath73 and conformal time to write the equations of motion of the fourier modes of the fields in the form of a simple harmonic oscillator @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the scaled fourier mode of conformal field @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the comoving length of the lattice and @xmath78 is the comoving dispersion relation .",
    "note that we have used the effective wave number @xmath60 which is calculated from the discrete fourier transform of the discretized laplacian operator .",

    "this method might however lead to inaccurate number density results @xcite whereas the effective wave number takes properly the used discretization into account .",
    "we have also defined the effective mass @xmath80 in equation ( [ disp ] ) where the brackets denote an average over the lattice .",
    "the number density of the scalar particles can be then written in terms of the scaled modes @xmath81 as @xmath82 which is calculated by binning the data into spherical shells in the momentum space that are then averaged .",

    "we will use the excess kurtosis which is defined as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the fourth moment about the mean and @xmath3 is the standard deviation ( not to be confused with the curvaton field ) .",
    "this quantity is mainly used to gauge how much the distribution of the curvaton field deviates from a gaussian one for which it is identically zero .",
    "a large value of kurtosis generally indicates that the distribution has more mass in the tails .",
    "we use a fourth order symplectic integrator to solve the evolution of the system in conformal time .",
    "the output is calculated after a constant number of integration steps .",
    "the moving averages presented in the figures are calculated over these points meaning that when presented in physical time the length of the averaged period increases with time .",

    "[ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] we have the fractional energy density @xmath138 and the difference of the logarithm of the scale factor @xmath32 calculated at the reference value of the hubble parameter @xmath153 as a function of the initial homogeneous value of the curvaton .",
    "the curvature perturbation @xmath123 calculated with formula ( [ zeta - eq ] ) is given in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "we have also included least square fits of the equations ( [ ln_a_r ] ) in the graphs with the corresponding polynomial coefficients given in table [ table-1 ] .",
    "note that we have also included the confidence intervals of the parameters at 95 % level which were derived from the fitting results given by mathematica .    with these results",
    "the curvaton fraction at decay reads @xmath161 . assuming that the radiation stays dominant after the end of the simulation and that @xmath162 during this period the value of the hubble parameter at decay can be calculated to be roughly @xmath163 which translates to a reheating temperature @xmath164 which is considerably higher than the result of the previous section .",
    "the non - gaussianity variable can be calculated from equation ( [ f nl2 ] ) or by fitting @xmath123 directly with equation ( [ zeta-2 ] ) .",
    "the results are @xmath165 and @xmath166 respectively at @xmath167 confidence level . when compared to the results of a two field curvaton resonance model @xcite the quadratic polynomials follow more closely the general trend of the data . despite this",
    "the calculated level of non - gaussianity is still very high and the current observational limit @xcite @xmath168 at @xmath167 confidence level rules out the model with the current parameter values .",
    "this large level of non - gaussianity is mainly caused by the magnitude of the second order coefficient @xmath149 and the smallness of the first order coefficient @xmath148 in equation ( [ f nl2 ] ) .",
    "an easy remedy to this would be to use a smaller curvaton self - interaction strength which would lead to a more linear evolution of the fractional energy density of the curvaton in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "this might however cause some thermalization related problems mentioned briefly in the previous section : for smaller values of self - interaction coupling strength the rescattering phase after the resonance period was found to be very weak and limited and the final shape of the number spectrum exhibit a clear peak at @xmath169 .",
    "the created comoving number density of the particles in this case would be also orders of magnitude smaller than with the current values .",
    "we have studied the self - interacting curvaton scenario with classical fields and lattice simulations from two different perspectives .",
    "first we concentrated on the thermalization process during and after the preheating phase .",
    "the results indicate that in the current curvaton scenario the overall evolution of system follows closely the previously studied self - interacting inflaton model .",
    "we found that during the resonance period curvaton particles were created at a predicted resonance band and in the ensuing rescattering phase the spectrum developed peaks at harmonic frequencies related to the momentum values of the resonance band .",
    "the final state of the curvaton field could be characterized as a pre - thermalized one .",
    "after this we concentrated on the calculation of the generated non - gaussianity during the resonance .",
    "we employed and adapted a previously presented method @xcite to the self - interacting curvaton scenario . when compared to the broad resonance of curvaton @xcite the simulation data was found to be a better fit to the used quadratic approximation of the curvature perturbation .",
    "the used parameter values were however rule out by the current observational limits and were found to be unphysical .",
    "there might however be regions in the parameter space that could lead to non - gaussianities consistent with the observations .",
    "this would however take more computing resources that were available while doing this paper .",
    "one option would be to make a distributed version of pycool that would systematically scan the parameter space for suitable initial values .",
    "another interesting possibility would be to study the generation of gravitational waves during the curvaton resonance which would likely give additional limitations on the curvaton model .",
    "this could be done easily with a recently updated version of pycool and we leave it for future work .",
    "the author is thankful to arttu rajantie for useful comments and for providing a code that was helpful when developing the non - gaussianity procedures .",
    "useful comments and discussions with iiro vilja are also gratefully acknowledged .",
