    "it has a prograde orbit with a semi - major axis of @xmath1  km and an eccentricity of 0.75 @xcite . because of its large and highly eccentric orbit",
    ", nereid is categorized as an irregular satellite .",
    "irregular satellites are generally believed to have been captured into the hill sphere of the host planets from heliocentric orbits ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , as an exception , the history of nereid is still unclear .",
    "@xcite suggest that nereid could originally have been a regular satellite . in this model , it formed close to neptune in the circumplanetary disk and then was transported outward due to perturbations by ni triton .",
    "the orbit scattering could also change nereid s orbit from circular to eccentric .",
    "nereid is comparatively bright ( @xmath2 @xmath3 19.2  mag at opposition ; @xcite ) for an irregular satellite .",
    "numerous ground - based observations have been carried out for measuring the rotational properties .",
    "some of them show large variations of the magnitude exceeding @xmath31.3  mag with a rotation period of 824  hr @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that nereid has a nonperiodic brightness variation with a total amplitude of 1.83  mag .",
    "we note that nereid was located in vicinity of the galactic plane when these earlier data were collected and the apparent large variations could have been due to the crowded field stars . in contrast ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite report a small amplitude of less than 0.1  mag . also ,",
    "measurements by voyager 2 over a 12-day interval found no brightness variation greater than 0.15  mag @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed relative photometry of nereid with 0.0030.006  mag accuracy using the ctio 4-m telescope and obtained lightcurves with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.029 @xmath0 0.003  mag and a rotation period of 11.52 @xmath0 0.14  hr .",
    "different measurements so far report different levels of the rotational brightness variation .",
    "@xcite suggest chaotic variations of the rotation from year to year , like svii hyperion @xcite . @xcite",
    "propose that if nereid was originally a regular satellite and has an elongated body with larger than @xmath31% of deviation from sphere , nereid may be in chaotic rotation for any spin period of longer than about 2 weeks due to the tidal effect .",
    "on the other hand , the long - term variability of rotation is possibly produced by precession of the spin axis caused by the gravitational torques from neptune @xcite .",
    "while the possibility of chaotic rotation was excluded by @xcite , the rotation state remains uncertain .",
    "this paper presents time - series photometric data of nereid collected at the 8.2-m subaru telescope .",
    "we determine the amplitude and period of the rotational brightness variation with high accuracy .",
    "they give strong indications of the rotation state of nereid ; whether stable or variable .",
    "in addition , the rotation period is available for investigating the links to other small bodies .",
    "we use the results to discuss the origin and dynamical evolution of nereid in the final stage of planet formation .",
    "observations were conducted on 2008 september 1 , 2 , and 29 ut using the subaru prime focus camera , suprime - cam @xcite , mounted on the subaru telescope . the suprime - cam consists of ten 2048@xmath44096 ccds , which are arranged in a 5@xmath42 pattern with interchip gaps of @xmath315@xmath5 .",
    "it covers a 34@xmath6 @xmath4 27@xmath6 field of view ( fov ) with a pixel scale of 0@xmath720 .",
    "each image was obtained with a 240-sec exposure using the @xmath8-band filter with the center wavelength of 0.6  @xmath9 and the band width of 0.2  @xmath9 .",
    "one fov around neptune was taken for 12 hours each night ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "neptune was placed at an interchip gap to reduce its bright light .",
    "nereid was @xmath37@xmath6 away from neptune and its solar phase angle shifted from 0.55@xmath10 to 1.34@xmath10 during our observations .",
    "the sky motion , 2.54.0  arcsec  hr@xmath11 , was slow enough to be approximately viewed as a point source within the exposure .",
    "the typical seeing was 0@xmath770 in the first night , 0@xmath765 in the second night , and 0@xmath760 in the last night .",
    "the data reduction was performed using iraf and sdfred2 @xcite with the following processes : overscan subtraction , flat fielding , distortion correction , sky background subtraction , and relative photometry .",
    "we estimate the flux via aperture photometry using the apphot task of iraf .",
    "the aperture radius is 1.4 times that of a typical fwhm on a night that is optimum to obtain high @xmath12/@xmath13 data for a point source @xcite .",

    "the apparent magnitude of nereid is derived from the relative flux to the reference stars and their total @xmath2 magnitude .",
    "the brightness variation of a rotating body with such a small amplitude could be attributed to the changes in the cross - section area and/or albedo inhomogeneity .",

    "must be corrected .",

    "the rotation period ( 2@xmath22 = 11.50  hr @xmath0 0.10  hr ) and amplitude ( 0.031 @xmath0 0.001  mag ) well agree with those presented by @xcite , namely 11.52 @xmath0 0.14  hr and 0.029 @xmath0 0.003  mag .",
    "this represents the constancy of nereid s rotation state among august 2001 , august 2002 @xcite , and september 2008 ( this study ) .",
    "we found no evidence of the rotation variability over 7 years .",
    "the rotation period is much shorter than the lower bound to induce the spin - orbit resonance or chaotic rotation , about 2 weeks @xcite .",
    "nereid is observed to be and likely to remain in a constant rotation state .    under the assumption of albedo homogeneity , the brightness fluctuation with",
    "0.03-mag amplitude constrains the body shape .",

    "assuming @xmath48 = 16 years , the body must have @xmath44 @xmath52 4.3 .",
    "this elongated shape is hardly acceptable to reproduce a small lightcurve amplitude , supporting the assertion that nereid has a non - chaotic rotation with no precession .",
    "it is widely known that atmosphereless bodies exhibit an exponential increase in reflectance at tiny solar phase angle , called an opposition surge .",
    "@xcite determined the phase curves of nereid using multi - year - combined photometric data on 246 nights from 1998 to 2006 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they have a sharp brightening exceeding 0.3  mag  deg@xmath11 down from @xmath26 @xmath3 0.5@xmath10 , represented by the best - fit model for surface scattering @xcite as @xmath53/[2(1+z)^2]\\right\\ } , \\label{eq_pc}\\ ] ] @xmath54/0.0134.\\ ] ] on the other hand , @xcite reported the surge slope of 0.14 @xmath0 0.08 mag  deg@xmath11 at @xmath26 @xmath3 0.4@xmath10 , which disagrees with the measurements by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the combined phase curves and their slopes of nereid presented by this work and those of previous studies .",
    "both the magnitude and surge slope of our data are consistent with the model curve of eq.([eq_pc ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the surge given by @xcite is too shallow .",
    "the discrepancy is most likely due to the small range of phase angles spanned by their observations ( 0.35@xmath550.46@xmath55 ) .",
    "there is no doubt that nereid has a steep opposition surge , indicating that the coherent backscattering mechanism is dominant on nereid s surface @xcite .",
    "from the large , eccentric , and inclined orbit of nereid , it is natural to consider its origin as a captured body from outside the neptune system .",
    "@xcite investigated the capture of irregular satellites in the planetesimal disk by three - body gravitational reactions during encounters between the giant planets .",
    "this model well reproduces the orbits of nereid and most neptunian irregular satellites .",
    "also , the long - term dynamical stability of nereid s orbit has been confirmed @xcite .",
    "it is perfectly possible that nereid has been an irregular satellite since it started orbiting around neptune .",
    "@xcite found that long - lived temporary capture of planetesimals in the prograde direction occurs at a limited range of initial orbital elements .",
    "the capture rate has a peak at @xmath56 and @xmath57 . here",
    ", @xmath58 is the initial orbital eccentricity scaled by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the hill radius and @xmath61 is the semi - major axis of the planet ; @xmath62 is the energy integral described as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the initial orbital inclination scaled by @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the difference in the initial semi - major axis between the planet and a planetesimal scaled by @xmath60 @xcite . for neptune",
    ", these conditions correspond to @xmath67 and @xmath68  3.84.6  au in @xmath64 ranging from 0 to @xmath58 ( @xmath51 and @xmath69 are non - scaled @xmath58 and @xmath66 , respectively ) .",
    "the source of neptunian irregular satellites with prograde orbits is likely to be a planetesimal population in the region between 25  au and 35  au if they were captured at the current location of neptune .",
    "although most planetesimals were lost from such a region , a portion of them possibly survives as tnos and centaurs .",
    "after dissipation of the disk gas , the giant planets underwent orbital migration due to angular momentum exchange with residual planetesimals @xcite .",
    "this led to extensive outward transport of planetesimals from 2535  au to the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "@xcite indicate that small bodies in the entire kuiper belt were formed within @xmath335  au and were transported outward as a result of neptune s migration . combining those studies ,",
    "prograde irregular satellites of neptune may have the same origin as tnos and centaurs .",
    "if nereid derives from a captured planetesimal , this implication applies to it as well .",
    "it is worth comparing nereid with tnos and centaurs in term of some physical properties to examine this hypothesis .",
    "nereid has optical colors of @xmath70 = 0.71 @xmath0 0.04  mag , @xmath16 = 0.44 @xmath0 0.03  mag , and @xmath71 = 0.72 @xmath0 0.05  mag @xcite .",
    "the colors of 351 tnos / centaurs are provided by the mboss color database @xcite .",
    "we use only those with uncertainties less than 0.05  mag for a comparison with nereid .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show the color - color diagrams , @xmath70 vs. @xmath16 and @xmath70 vs. @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "one can see that nereid is indistinguishable from tnos / centaurs in the color - color planes , supporting a common origin between them .",
    "it is notable that nereid s colors are similar to those of neutrally colored bodies rather than red bodies .",
    "@xcite suggest that tnos formed in the inner part of the primordial disk retain h@xmath72o , co@xmath72 and poor hydrocarbon species on the surface which lead to a neutral color due to uv and high - energy particle irradiation .",
    "nereid may have been originally formed at the region inside of @xmath320  au and transported into near neptune s orbit .",
    "we also focus on the distribution of rotation period as another indicator of similarity between nereid and tnos / centaurs .",
    "the rotation properties of small bodies , excluding tidally locked satellites , are dominantly changed by mutual collisions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the collisional evolution of rotation period depends on the size distribution , impact velocity , and bulk density , which are unique among small - body populations .",
    "therefore , small - body populations with the same source are expected to have a common rotation distribution .",
    "interestingly , tnos / centaurs seem to have a characteristic pattern in the size - rotation distribution .",
    "larger bodies rotate more slowly if they are greater than a few hundred kilometers in diameter @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the probability of this trend using a large lightcurve database of 102 tnos / centaurs compiled by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the distribution of their rotation periods against diameter derived by an assumed albedo of 0.1 .",
    "there appears to be a monotonic increasing trend beyond 200300  km .",
    "we calculated the spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xcite of the sample including 33 objects with @xmath73 @xmath52 250  km except for the tidally locked pluto - charon binary and haumea , a rapidly rotating dwarf planet .",
    "the correlation coefficient is @xmath74 = 0.53 , meaning that large tnos / centaurs have a positive correlation between rotation and size at the significance level greater than 99.5  % .",
    "this trend is explained by the random accumulation effect of angular momentum through collisions @xcite .",
    "the rotation period of nereid is plotted on figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "we found that nereid perfectly agrees with the size - rotation correlation of tnos / centaurs .",
    "this agreement supports the idea that nereid and tno / centaur populations share the same origin .",
    "the capture scenario needs no additional spin - change events to explain the present rapid rotation , unlike the other hypothesis based on the outward ejection from nearby neptune .",
    "it is more likely that nereid is derived from a captured body rather than a primordial satellite of neptune .",
    "we present highly accurate lightcurves of nereid on two consecutive nights and one night after one month later in september 2008 at phase angles of 0.5@xmath101.3@xmath10 .",
    "the periodic analysis shows that the rotation period of 11.5 @xmath0 0.1  hr , peak - to - peak amplitude in brightness variation of 0.031 @xmath0 0.001  mag .",
    "they completely agree with the measurements in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the steepness of magnitude increases due to the opposition surge is 0.138 @xmath0 0.002  mag  deg@xmath11 which is consistent with the phase curve model presented by @xcite .",
    "the conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the period and amplitude of nereid s rotation are constant in 20012002 and 2008 .",
    "we found no evidence of variability of the rotation state .",
    "the rapid rotation with a period much shorter than 2 weeks also rejects the chaotic rotation state suggested by @xcite .",
    "these facts indicate that nereid has a stable rotation without a tidal despinning effect .",
    "long - lived prograde captures of planetesimals by planets occur in a narrow range of the initial eccentricity and orbital energy @xcite .",
    "if nereid was a body captured from a heliocentric orbit , the source region is likely to be from @xmath325  au to @xmath335  au where it is suggested that tnos have been formed @xcite .",
    "3 .   the optical colors of nereid are consistent with those of tnos / centaurs . also , nereid accords closely with the size - rotation distribution of tnos / centaurs .",
    "the available observations support the hypothesis that nereid derived from a captured body and shares a common origin with the tno / centaur population .",

    "<S> our time - series photometric observations confirm that the spin is stable and non - chaotic with a period of 11.5  hr as indicated by grav et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2003 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical colors of nereid are indistinguishable from those of trans - neptunian objects and centaurs , especially those with neutral colors . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the consistency of nereid s rotation with the size - rotation distribution of small outer bodies . </S>",
    "<S> it is more likely that nereid originates in an immigrant body captured from a heliocentric orbit which was 45  au away from neptune s orbit . </S>"
