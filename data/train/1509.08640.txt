    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are popular candidates to account for dark matter ( dm ) in the universe .",
    "there are different ways to explore the landscape of dm models from a phenomenological perspective .",
    "one is the use of effective operators describing the interactions between the standard model ( sm ) and the wimp in the framework of effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "another approach is to use simplified models containing a minimal set of new particles that allow to describe the phenomenology of dm via renormalizable interactions . although the eft framework has been successfully used for the description of dm interactions at rather low energies  like the interpretation of direct detection experiments",
    " it has been pointed out that eft may break down when probing dark matter production at the lhc  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we consider a model that extends the sm by a majorana fermion dm , @xmath0 , and a vector mediator , @xmath1 , which couples to the dm and the sm quarks with axial - vector interactions , with couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "for such a model , lhc searches are expected to be more sensitive than direct detection experiments as the model does not provide any contribution to spin - independent wimp - nucleon scattering .",
    "we present limits on the parameters space of this model from mono - jet searches at the lhc  @xcite and compare them to the respective limits obtained in the eft approximation . for realistic values of the couplings , @xmath4",
    ", the lhc provides limits on the messenger mass @xmath5 .",
    "as these are accessible energies at lhc collisions , contributions from on - shell messenger production can be large .",
    "hence , limits from the simplified model and the eft can differ significantly as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : lhc ] .    as a complementary constraint on the parameter space we consider limits on the spin - dependent wimp - proton scattering from dm annihilation in the sun .",
    "to this end we re - interpret limits from icecube  @xcite within our model , where annihilation into top quark pairs and pairs of mediators are important .",
    "these limits are particularly constraining for large dm masses where the lhc looses its sensitivity .",
    "we discuss them in sec .",
    "[ sec : icecube ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we conclude .",
    "in this work we interpret two searches for mono - jet plus missing transverse momentum ( met ) signatures performed by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite at the @xmath6tev lhc . to this end",
    "we performed a monte carlo simulation of the signal and imposed the search cuts detailed in @xcite .",
    "based on the background analysis provided in these references we are thus able to set 95% cl exclusion limits on the parameters of the model . for details",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the considered model has four independent parameters .",
    "the dm mass , @xmath7 , the mediator mass , @xmath8 , and the couplings of the mediator to the dm , @xmath2 , and the sm quarks @xmath9 .",
    "we assume universal couplings to all sm quarks and neglect couplings to leptons .",
    "we show our results for various slices of the parameter space where we fix the product of the couplings , @xmath10 and the mediator width , @xmath11 .",
    "we choose this parametrization as the cross section for dm production directly depends on these parameters .",
    "however , not all values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are consistent within this model as we will show below .    for comparison",
    "we also derive limits in the eft approximation of the considered model . for this",
    "we integrate out the messenger to obtain a 4-fermion contact interaction with an effective coupling @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the parameter space reduces to two parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath14 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainres ] we show the exclusion limits for the eft ( dashed lines ) and the simplified model ( solid lines ) for four slices of the considered parameter space . whilst the eft limit extents to very high dm masses above a tev",
    "the limit from simplified models goes down very drastically for @xmath15 . in this region",
    "the eft approximation significantly over - estimates the sensitivity .",
    "further , also for @xmath16 we find significant deviations in the resulting limit on @xmath8 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the limit on @xmath8 placed for @xmath17 lies in the region of reachable lhc energies .",
    "this can lead to both an under- or over - estimation of the sensitivity .",
    "on the one hand , contribution from on - shell mediator production could greatly enhance the cross section .",
    "this is the dominant effect for the parameter slices with @xmath18 ( left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mainres ] ) .",
    "the effect becomes more pronounced for the smaller coupling , @xmath19 , ( see lower panels ) as the limits are placed at lower @xmath8 where the contribution from on - shell mediator production is even larger . in this region",
    "eft under - estimates the sensitivity . on the other hand , for very small @xmath8 ( below the energy scale of the required met in the considered searches )",
    "the cross section is reduced and the eft approximation again over - estimates the limit .",
    "this can be seen in the case @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( lower right panel ) where the cms limit for the simplified model completely vanishes whilst the eft would exclude @xmath21 .",
    "as mentioned above not all combinations of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath22 and @xmath11 are consistent within the model . in fig .",
