    "[ f : lumfunct ] ; @xcite ) , a 2.5mag ( a factor 10 in continuum flux density ) deeper photometric selection would open the door to a quasar population which is expected to be an order of magnitude more abundant . for a given accretion rate ( black hole mass ) this population would probe active galaxies with an order of magnitude lower black hole mass ( accretion rate ) .",
    "the abundance of smbhs at lower masses and accretion rates is a valuable constraint for the various alternative theories for the formation and early evolution of smbhs and their hosts .",
    "these include the remnants of population iii stars , yielding black hole seeds of the order of @xmath24m@xmath17 , direct collapse of primordial dense gas in protogalaxies leading to masses of the order of @xmath28m@xmath17 and run - away dynamical instabilities in dense stellar systems which could result in initial black hole masses of the order of @xmath29m@xmath17 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one of the questions is how many quasars we were expecting in our survey . to estimate this",
    ", we took the @xmath0 quasar luminosity function and computed the expected number of quasars as function of area and limiting magnitude . the limiting magnitude varied from area to area , and",
    "mostly depended on the depth of the kids @xmath44-band imaging . the median depth to which we could search for quasars was @xmath54 .",
    "we integrated the @xcite luminosity function and in the redshift range @xmath52 we expected @xmath1@xmath55 quasars in the area we surveyed , where we discovered four .",
    "the difference between the predicted number and the observed number of quasars might well be due to various sources of incompleteness of our search .",
    "the most prominent ones are : catalogue completeness , point source selection efficiency and completeness of the colour selection . in @xcite",
    "it was found that the viking catalogue completeness is @xmath196% above a s / n of 7 , while the fraction of point sources that is incorrectly classified as extended objects is around 6%7% .",
    "the largest incompleteness is the colour incompleteness : both due to random photometric errors and due to small variations in the quasar spectral energy distribution and in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) absorption , quasars can be placed outside our colour selection box .",
    "for example , quasars with a redshift around @xmath56 have an @xmath57 colour that is a steep function of redshift , see e.g.  fig .  1 in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that we are missing quasars around @xmath56 that have @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , by matching our data with high - redshift quasars that have previously been discovered , we found that the sdss quasar j0836 + 0054 at @xmath59 @xcite is detected in both the viking and kids survey .",
    "while the redshift of this quasar is very close to the ones we present in this paper , j0836 + 0054 has an @xmath60 , well below our cut of @xmath61 . at the high end of our probed redshift range , @xmath62 , due to variations in the igm and in the quasar s emission line strength and due to photometric uncertainties",
    ", quasars can become too red in @xmath63 to be selected by our colour criterion ( @xmath64 , see section  [ s : selection ] ) .",
    "in @xcite it was shown through modelling that up to 15% of artificial quasars at @xmath65 fulfilled the colour selection @xmath66 .",
    "this indicates that we are also incomplete in our selection of quasars at @xmath67 .",
    "combined with the other sources of incompleteness , the discovery of four new quasars is well in line with the theoretical expectation of seven .",
    "the total area that ultimately will be covered by the kids and viking surveys is 1500 deg@xmath2 , roughly six times the area we searched in our pilot study .",
    "we therefore expect to discover at least 20 additional quasars in this area .",
    "furthermore , there are several ways to push our quasar search to even fainter magnitudes .",
    "for example , when selecting quasar candidates , we could reduce the @xmath57 colour limit to @xmath68 ( similar to the ps1 quasar search , see @xcite ) .",
    "this will increase our completeness , especially at the low - redshift end of our quasar search , @xmath56 .",
    "additionally , our requirement for a candidate to have a detection in the @xmath47 band , while significantly reducing the number of spurious sources , limits in certain areas how faint we can select candidates as the @xmath44 and @xmath46 band catalogues are deeper than the @xmath47-band catalogue ( see table  [ tab : exptimes ] ) . by pushing our selection to fainter magnitudes , we should be able to uncover quasars as faint as @xmath69 .",
    "based on the quasar luminosity function , we therefore expect to discover at least 30 more quasars down to @xmath12 , significantly increasing the number of quasars at these faint absolute magnitudes .",
    "besides exploring the new survey data that will become available , our plan is to characterize the newly discovered quasars with near - infrared , far - infrared and sub - mm spectroscopy .",
    "this will allow us to constrain black hole masses , ism metallicity and host masses .",
