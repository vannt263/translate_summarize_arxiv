    "<S> an efficient bn based ultraviolet ( uv ) light emitter in the 5.3 - 5.9 ev energy range has been recently obtained using accelerated electrons as the pumping source @xcite . for the design of future h - bn devices it is fundamental to have an in - depth description and understanding of the complex luminescence of this material .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretical and experimental works have demonstrated that the emission spectrum of h - bn is dominated by a frenkel type exciton at 5.75 ev @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , a single peak emission appears only in high quality macroscopic crystals that can be obtained only in a limited amount through high pressure and high temperature synthesis processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> common h - bn samples present a more complex emission spectrum with a series of sharp emissions close to the main exciton in the 5.3 - 5.9 ev energy range . </S>",
    "<S> an additional broad emission occurs within the electronic band gap in the energy range 3.2 - 4.5 ev on which a series of three sharp lines might be superposed depending on the bn sample purity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this complex emission pattern is still controversial and it has been attributed to the presence of unidentified structural defects . </S>",
    "<S> impurities have been proposed to be responsible for emission lines in the band gap @xcite and generic dislocations or grain boundaries to be at the origin of emission lines near the free exciton . </S>",
    "<S> the latter hypothesis has been suggested by the appearance of additional emission peaks when a pristine perfect crystal was deformed by a limited mechanical strain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been shown through sub - micrometric emission maps obtained by cathodoluminescence ( cl ) filtered images that the standard exciton is homogeneous in a h - bn crystallite whereas additional peaks present some spatial localization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , research conducted in the last ten years has not yet been able to correlate the optical properties of h - bn with the microscopic structure of defects . </S>",
    "<S> here we address this fundamental question by adopting a theoretical and experimental approach combining few nanometer resolved cathodoluminescence techniques @xcite with high resolution transmission electron microscopy images and state of the art quantum mechanical simulations . </S>",

    "<S> individual particles were scanned by a 1 nm electron probe in a scanning transmission electron microscope ( stem ) and a full emission spectrum in the 3.0 - 6.0 ev energy range was acquired at each probe position together with a bright field and a high angle annular dark field image , haadf ( a full emission spectrum is shown in supplementary figure 1 ) . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on excitonic emissions in the 5.3 - 5.9 ev energy range , the most interesting spectral region for optical applications @xcite , leaving to future discussion additional emissions appearing occasionally in the middle of the band gap .    in figure [ emission spectra].a , </S>",

    "<S> a series of five emission lines at 5.30 , 5.46 , 5.62 , 5.75 and 5.86 ev is clearly visible in the overall cathodoluminescence spectrum of the nanoparticle ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ emission spectra].c ) . </S>",
    "<S> these energies correspond to previously reported values for h - bn crystals and multi - walled bn nanotubes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> photoluminescence experiments conducted at different temperatures show finer structures for temperatures below 50 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these additional features are smeared at higher temperature and thus are not visible through our experimental set up operating at about 150 k.    the three example spectra presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ emission spectra].c show the strong inhomogeneities in the peak s relative intensities occuring at different probe positions . </S>",
    "<S> thin samples present regions in which only the h - bn bulk exciton , usually called the free exciton , occurs ( supplementary figure 2 ) . in order to extract the spectral weight of individual emission lines </S>",
    "<S> , a multi - lorentzian fitting routine has been applied to each spectrum of the spectrum image . </S>",
    "<S> whereas peak energies were free parameters of the fitting procedure , no relevant energy shifts were detected across individual and between different flakes . </S>",
    "<S> intensity maps derived from this analysis are shown in figure [ emission spectra].d - h . </S>",
    "<S> each map has been normalized independently on the basis of the most intense pixel . </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned however that peaks at 5.62 and 5.86 ev are systematically significantly weaker than other emission lines and this behavior can not be attributed solely to detection efficiency differences .    </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of intensity maps demonstrates strong inhomogeneities occurring at lines crossing the flakes . the free excitonic emission at 5.75 ev and the two emission peaks at 5.62 ev and 5.86 ev are distributed all across the particle . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily , the two emission peaks at 5.30 ev and 5.46 ev are mostly localized at the lines . </S>",
    "<S> all emission maps are clearly not correlated one with another and thus all five emission features should be considered independent .    </S>",
    "<S> lines visible in cl maps appear also clearly in haadf and bright field images and thus they are associated with local structural changes . furthermore they occur mostly in pairs separated by few up to hundred of nanometers ( supplementary figure 3 ) . for a better understanding on how specific emission peaks are associated with specific structural features , </S>",
    "<S> these lines have been characterized by bright field imaging in an aberration corrected stem .        in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ focal - series].g we present a haadf image for a pair of parallel bright lines and the corresponding scanning transmission bright field focal series ( fig.[focal - series].a - f ) . each line is formed by two parallel fringes indicating layers parallel to the electron beam direction . the under - focused image ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ focal - series].a ) is rather similar to the image of a double walled bn nanotube , but unlike the case of a nanotube the focus for the two series of fringes occurs at two different defocus values ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ focal - series].b , c ) . this corresponds to a situation where the two series of fringes lie at different depths . </S>",
    "<S> finally when both pairs of fringes are overfocused the image of the underlying h - bn lattice is recovered ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ focal - series].e , f ) . a similar behavior is found also for structures with a higher number of fringes ( supplementary figure 4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior described here can be explained by a model in which a layer stack can deform forming two almost parallel folds ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fold ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this double folded structure has been proposed to occur in neutron irradiated graphite @xcite and it has been recently imaged in cvd grown few - layer graphene @xcite and mos@xmath2 flakes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our observations do not allow to exclude the additional presence of single folds whereas they might be less common than double folds . </S>",
    "<S> emission peaks at energies of 5.30 ev and 5.46 ev are thus solely associated with folds .        </S>",
    "<S> the different curvature of the layers at the fold induces , as for any multi layered structure , a relative glide of the layers and thus a loss of the original aa@xmath3 stacking sequence of the perfect h - bn crystal ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fold ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the local atomic structure of the folds is thus analogous to the structure of multi walled nanotubes where in principle no defined stacking sequence exists . </S>",
    "<S> however , in multiwalled bn nanotubes and in other inorganic nanotubes the competition between bending and interplane energies tends to localize the curvature and to promote polygonal tube sections with facets of well defined stacking , not necessarly aa@xmath3 @xcite . the local atomic structure at the fold s facets should thus correspond to stacking sequences that can be generated from the original aa@xmath3 structure by a glide of the layers . </S>",
    "<S> two metastable configurations can then be obtained by translating one of the basal planes by a vector @xmath4 , with @xmath5 a real number . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath6 the @xmath7 structure is obtained , where , following an analogous nomenclature for graphite nitrogen and boron atoms lies at @xmath8 and @xmath9 sites respectively , and for @xmath10 , the @xmath11 structure , where atoms positions are inverted ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fold ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the fold follows an armchair direction , as is seen most often in scanning transmission bright field images ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ focal - series].f , g ) , antiphase domains appear in the region between the folds . </S>",
    "<S> the stacking of planes at antiphase domain boundaries corresponds to a metastable aa order or , by applying an additional translation , an @xmath12 order ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fold ] ) . besides the specific fold case , </S>",
    "<S> antiphase domains are , as for graphite , a common defect in h - bn and indeed aa stacking orders have been recently identified in few layer h - bn crystals @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these topological considerations suggest that additional excitonic peaks should be associated solely with changes of the crystal symmetry in the above - mentioned five possible stacking sequences . in order to confirm this hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a complementary theoretical investigation of the optical spectra for these configurations . </S>",
    "<S> it has been successfully demonstrated that fundamental insights on emission can be provided by an analysis of simulated absorption spectra , taking into account that absolute energies could not be accessed due to the neglect of stokes shifts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> wave functions were obtained in the framework of density functional theory using the local density approximation and quasi particle energies were corrected by a subsequent gw treatment @xcite . in a first step , optical spectra were evaluated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . finally </S>",
    "<S> , electron hole interactions , associated with excitonic effects that dominate the h - bn optical spectra , have been included by solving the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this computational scheme has been successfully applied to the study of the absorption spectrum of h - bn and bn nanotubes @xcite . due to the well known underestimation of the h - bn band gap in the non self consistent gw computational scheme </S>",
    "<S> a 0.35 ev rigid shift has been applied to all spectra that allows the alignment of the excitonic peak of the aa@xmath3 stacking to the known experimental value .        </S>",
    "<S> for different h - bn polytypes , bands dispersion remains invariant in the * @xmath13 * * @xmath14 * plane . </S>",
    "<S> however for directions parallel to the * @xmath15 * axis the last two occupied and first two unoccupied bands are either degenerate or split depending on stacking order . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to changes in the direct band gap observed both at the dft and gw level ( see table 1 in the supplementary materials ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior has also a fundamental role in defining the optical properties of different stacking configurations . indeed in agreement with the work of arnaud et al . on aa@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> h - bn @xcite , we find for all configurations that directions parallel to the * @xmath15 * axis give rise to the first absorption peak of @xmath16 both at rpa and bse levels . quasi - particle band gaps and exciton binding energies are finally strongly dependent on the stacking order and </S>",
    "<S> determine the energies of optically active excitons ( more details will be provided in a future work ) .    </S>",
    "<S> all absorption spectra presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ theo ] show strong excitons with well separated energies in the range between 5.2 to 5.9 ev depending on the stacking configuration . taking as a reference the standard aa@xmath3 exciton at 5.75 ev </S>",
    "<S> , three additional excitons , associated with the @xmath7 , @xmath11 and aa configurations , occur at lower energies whereas that of the @xmath12 configuration is found at a higher one . </S>",
    "<S> energy range and peak distribution coincide with experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> thus theoretical simulations enable us to associate each of the five measured emission peaks with the five high symmetry configurations analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular emissions at 5.30 and 5.46 ev , strongly localized at folds , can be attributed to @xmath7 and @xmath11 stacking sequences respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these models </S>",
    "<S> are compatible with the faceted fold structure where discret layer glides between facets give rise to well defined stacking orders . emissions at 5.62 and 5.86 ev can be associated with the aa and @xmath12 stacking respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since these stackings appear at antiphase boundaries , these excitons occur in large regions of the flake and their signal is weak due to the small number of atomic planes involved . </S>",
    "<S> we underline that each intermediate stacking gives rise to different exciton energies ( supplementary figure 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental evidence for only five discrete emission lines is thus a clear indication of a finite number of stacking configurations and it confirms the hypothesis of faceted folds .    in conclusion , using a complementary experimental and theoretical approach we have provided a microscopic explanation for the complex emission spectrum of h - bn relating local changes in the layer stacking order to the appearance of additional excitons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown how these defects and the associated excitonic emissions can be strongly localized at folds crossing the flakes . </S>",
    "<S> finally our theoretical analysis reveals that , whereas additional emission lines in h - bn can still be interpreted as excitons bound to defects , they can be better described as bulk excitons of different polytypes . </S>",
    "<S> recently , </S>",
    "<S> h - bn polytypes have been discussed from a morphological and energetic point of view but little attention was paid to their optical and electronic properties @xcite . this study emphasizes the role of stacking changes in defining the optical properties of h - bn . the importance of stacking faults is thus directly related to the interest in h - bn as one of the most promising materials for high performance far ultraviolet emitters .    </S>",
