    "the purpose of this paper is to study the generalized fong  vasicek two - factor interest rate model with stochastic volatility . in this model",
    "the dispersion of the stochastic short rate ( square of volatility ) is assumed to be stochastic as well and it follows a non - negative process with volatility proportional to the square root of dispersion .",
    "the drift of the stochastic process for the dispersion is assumed to be in a rather general form including , in particular , linear function having one root ( yielding the original fong  vasicek model , cf .",
    "@xcite ) or a cubic like function having three roots ( yielding a generalized fong  vasicek model for description of the volatility clustering , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we consider averaged bond prices with respect to the limiting distribution of stochastic dispersion .",
    "the averaged bond prices depend on time and current level of the short rate like it is the case in many popular one - factor interest rate model including in particular the vasicek and cox  ingersoll - ross model . however , as a main result of this paper we show that there is no such one - factor model yielding the same bond prices as the averaged values described above .",
    "the term structure of bond prices ( or yields ) is a function of time to maturity , state variables like e.g. instantaneous interest rate as well as several model parameters .",
    "it describes a functional dependence between the time to maturity of a discount bond and its present price .",
    "the yield of bonds , as a function of maturity , forms a term structure of interest rates .",
    "figure  [ graf - vynosy ] shows the different shapes of term structures observed on the market based on data by bloomberg .",
    "we can observe various type of functional dependences including non - monotone term structures ( brazil ) or term structures having two local maxima ( uk ) .",
    "interest rate models are often formulated in terms of stochastic differential equations ( sde ) for the instantaneous interest rate ( or short rate ) as well as equations for other relevant quantities like e.g. volatility of the short rate process . in one - factor models",
    "there is a single stochastic differential equation for the short rate .",
    "the volatility of the short rate process is given in a deterministic way .",
    "they can be written in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a wiener process .",
    "we recall that a stochastic process @xmath2 is called a wiener process if @xmath3 , every increment @xmath4 has the normal distribution @xmath5 , the increments @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 for @xmath10 are independent and paths of the process are continuous ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath11 in ( [ dr-1f ] ) determines the trend in evolution of the short rate , function @xmath12 the nature of stochastic fluctuations .",
    "the price of a discount bond @xmath13 at time @xmath14 when the value of short rate is @xmath15 , is known to be a solution of the partial differential equation @xmath16 with the terminal condition @xmath17 for any @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a maturity of the bond . here",
    "@xmath20 stands for the so - called market price of risk .",
    "the above linear parabolic pde is derived by constructing a riskless portfolio of bonds and using it s lemma for evaluating differentials of a stochastic portfolio that is balanced by buying or selling bonds with different maturities .",
    "we refer the reader for a comprehensive overview of term structure modeling to the book by kwok ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) for details .",
    "we also remind ourselves that bond prices determine interest rates @xmath21 by the formula @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 one of the first models of the class ( [ dr-1f ] ) has been proposed by oldich vaek in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the short rate process is assumed to follow a stochastic differential equation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are positive constants .",
    "here @xmath26 stands for volatility of random fluctuations of the short rate process .",
    "deterministic part of the process @xmath27 represents a mean reversion process with a limit @xmath28 , referred to as long term interest rate .",
    "the speed of reversion is given by the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "in this model , for a constant market price of risk @xmath30 , the corresponding pde for bond prices @xmath31 has an explicit solution @xmath13 satisfying the terminal condition @xmath17 for any @xmath18 .",
    "it has the form @xmath32 where the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be expressed in a closed form ( see , e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) : @xmath35    there is a rich variety of several other models in which the sde for the short rate is given by a general process of the form : @xmath36 this class of short rate models includes the well - known cox - ingersoll - ross model @xcite with @xmath37 .",
    "a thorough comparison of these models is a topic of the paper by chan , karolyi , longstaff and sanders @xcite . using generalized method of moments they estimated the model ( [ ckls ] ) and they studied restrictions on parameters imposed in this models .",
    "their result that the optimal value of the parameter @xmath38 is approximately @xmath39 ( which is more than previous models assumed ) , started a broad discussion on the correct form of volatility .",
    "let us note that their result is not universal , e.g. in @xcite , using the same estimation methodology but for libor rates , @xmath38 was estimated to be less than unity ( which means that volatility is less than proportional to short rate , unlike in the result due to chan , karolyi , longstaff and sanders ) .",
    "approximate formulae for bond prices when the short rate follows ( [ ckls ] ) has been developed recently by @xcite and @xcite .    in one - factor models ,",
    "term structure of interest rates is a function of the short rate and model parameters .",
    "however , it means that as soon as the parameters of the model are chosen , the term structure corresponding to a given short rate is uniquely determined .",
    "this is a simplification from the reality , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ real - term - structures - eu ] , showing the examples from euribor data . to capture this feature ,",
    "two - factor models are introduced . in the two - factor models",
    "there are two sources of uncertainty yielding different term structures for the same short rate .",
    "they may depend on the value of the other factor .",
    "moreover , two - factor models have more variety of possible shapes of term structures .        a general two - factor model with the factors",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 is given by the system of sdes : @xmath42 where correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a assumed to be constant @xmath45 $ ] , i.e. @xmath46 . the short rate is a function of these two factors , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath48 the price of a zero coupon bond with maturity @xmath49 , at the time @xmath14 when the values of the factors are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the pde satisfied by the bond price , which reads as ( cf .",
    "* chapter 7 ) ) @xmath50 the parameters @xmath51 stand for market prices of risk corresponding to factors @xmath40 and @xmath41 , resp .",
    "the equation for the bond price is equipped by the terminal condition at @xmath52 , @xmath53 for any @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "there are several ways of incorporating the second stochastic factor .",
    "based on experimental data from real financial market it is reasonable to make an assumption that the market changes the volatility of the underlying process for the short rate .",
    "more precisely , the volatility of the stochastic process for the short rate is stochastic as well .",
    "an empirical confirmation of such an assumption can be found e.g. in the recent paper by the authors @xcite . in the so - called two - factor models with a stochastic volatility we allow the volatility to have a stochastic behavior driven by another stochastic differential equation . as an example of such a two - factors model one can consider the fong  vasicek model ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in which the stochastic volatility follows a mean reverting bessel - square root process .",
    "another possibility is to consider the generalized fong  vasicek model in which the drift function is no longer linear but it may have cubic like behavior having three distinct roots representing possible steady states for dispersion . by this",
    "we can model so - called volatility clustering phenomenon observed in real markets ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "now , as a consequence of the multidimensional it s lemma the corresponding equation for the bond price is a linear parabolic equation in two space dimensions .",
    "these spatial dimensions correspond to the short rate and volatility .",
    "let us consider the process a bessel square root process with a general drift function @xmath54 , @xmath55 it is well known that the density distribution of a stochastic process is a solution to the focker - planck partial differential equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recall that the cumulative distribution function @xmath56 of the process @xmath57 satisfying ( [ general - proc ] ) and starting almost surely from the initial datum @xmath58 can be obtained from a solution @xmath59 to the so - called focker - planck equation for the density function : @xmath60 here @xmath61 denotes the dirac delta function located at @xmath58 .",
    "the limiting density @xmath62 of the process is therefore a stationary solution to the focker - planck equation ( [ focker - planck ] ) .",
    "a stationary solution satisfying @xmath63 for @xmath64 is therefore a solution to the differential equation ( see @xcite ) @xmath65    concerning structural assumption made on the drift function @xmath66 we shall henceforth assume the following hypothesis : @xmath67    now it follows from the assumption ( a ) made on the drift function @xmath54 and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) that the stationary focker ",
    "planck equation ( [ focker - planck - limit ] ) has a solution @xmath68 that can be explicitly expressed as : @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath63 for @xmath71 . here",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 is a normalization constant such that @xmath74 .",
    "for example , if we consider a mean reverting bessel square root process for the stochastic dispersion @xmath41 , i.e. the drift function is linear @xmath75 then the limiting density distribution function @xmath68 is the gamma distribution function with shape parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see kwok @xcite ) .",
    "knowing the density distribution @xmath68 of the stochastic volatility we are able to perform averaging of the bond price and the term structure with respect to volatility .",
    "unlike the short rate which is known from the market data on daily basis , the volatility of the short rate process is unknown .",
    "the exact value of the stochastic volatility is not observable on the market , we can just observe its statistical properties .",
    "therefore such a volatility averaging is of special importance for practitioners .",
    "we shall consider the following model with stochastic volatility : @xmath78 with uncorrelated increments @xmath79 and @xmath80 of a wiener process .",
    "the market prices of risk are assumed to have a form @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then the bond price @xmath83 satisfies the following pde : @xmath84 with the terminal condition @xmath85 for any @xmath86 .",
    "the explicit solution can be written as @xmath87 with the terminal conditions @xmath88 for any @xmath70 and @xmath89 .",
    "the solution can be obtained by solving the following differential equations for the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath90    in what follows , we shall denote by @xmath91 the averaged value of the function @xmath92 with respect to the limiting density @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath93 , where @xmath94 satisfies the stationary focker ",
    "planck equation ( [ focker - planck - limit ] ) the averaged bond price with respect to the limiting distribution of the volatility is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "the function @xmath97 is a function of time @xmath14 and short rate @xmath15 .",
    "notice that it is the same functional dependence as for the bond price in one factor models , including , in particular , a solution to ( [ vasicek - sde ] ) given by ( [ tvar - riesenia ] ) .",
    "however , we show that there is no such one - factor model yielding the same bond prices as those of averaged bond prices @xmath13 given by the averaging of the two - factor model .",
    "now we are in a position to state our main result of the paper .",
    "we are going to prove that there is no one - factor interest rate model for the corresponding bond prices that is identical with the volatility averaged bond price @xmath13 for any @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 .",
    "suppose to the contrary that @xmath97 is a bond price from one - factor model in which the short rate is assumed to follow a general sde @xmath100 then is satisfies the pde @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the drift of the short rate process , @xmath103 is its volatility and @xmath104 is the product of the volatility and the corresponding market price of risk of the model . substituting the form of the solution we obtain that @xmath105 we see that the left hand side is a function of @xmath14 only .",
    "we denote it by @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath107 .",
    "then , @xmath108 and so the right hand side is constant with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "hence for any @xmath14 it equals @xmath109 , which is a constant denoted by @xmath110 .",
    "we have @xmath111 from which it follows that @xmath112 is a constant and that @xmath113 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath114 and @xmath115 the first two statistical moments of the random variable with respect to the limiting density function @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath116    we know that @xmath117 and from the expression @xmath118 we can recursively compute the values of the time derivatives of function @xmath119 at time @xmath49 : @xmath120    another way of computing these derivatives is using the expression @xmath121 and the partial differential equation ( [ a - eq ] ) for the function @xmath33 and the stationary focker ",
    "planck equation for the limiting density function @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , by integration by parts and taking into account boundary conditions @xmath122 for @xmath123 for the limiting density @xmath68 we obtain @xmath124 furthermore , by ( [ focker - planck - limit ] ) , we have @xmath125 therefore @xmath126 now taking into account pde ( [ a - eq ] ) for the function @xmath127 we can recurrently evaluate @xmath128 @xmath129 for any @xmath70 . using the above expressions and the identities @xmath130 , after straightforward computations we obtain @xmath131 and by comparing ( [ eq-2 ] ) and ( [ eq-6 ] ) we obtain the expression for the constant @xmath110 in terms of the model parameters as @xmath132 computing the next derivative we end up with @xmath133 and by comparing ( [ eq-3 ] ) and ( [ eq-7 ] ) we can express the volatility @xmath134 as @xmath135 notice that the pde for the averaged bond price now reads as follows : @xmath136 which is the pde corresponding to the classical one - factor vasicek interest rate model .",
    "now we fully determined the drift function minus market price function @xmath137 as well as the volatility function @xmath103 in ( [ general - pde ] ) .    in order to achieve contradiction",
    "we finally compute the fourth derivative as @xmath138 comparing ( [ eq-4 ] ) and ( [ eq-8 ] ) we get the condition @xmath139 however , the latter equality can not be satisfied for general choice of model parameters . indeed , setting @xmath140",
