    "the mechanism of formation of massive stars ( @xmath1 ) remains one of the open questions in astrophysics .",
    "massive stars appear in massive star associations where cloud fragmentation seems to be common .",
    "it is known that these stars originate inside giant and massive molecular clouds but the sequence of processes that take place during the formation of the star are mostly unknown .",
    "it has been suggested , for example , that the coalescence of various protostars in the same cloud can lead to the emergence of a massive star ( bonnell et al .",
    "1998 ) . alternatively",
    ", a massive star could form by the collapse of the core of a molecular cloud , with associated episodes of mass accretion and ejection , as observed in low - mass stars ( shu et al .",
    "in such a case , the effects of jets propagating through the medium that surrounds the protostar should be detectable .    until now",
    ", the formation of stars has been mostly associated with thermal radio and x - ray emission . however ,",
    "non - thermal radio emission has been detected in some massive star forming regions .",
    "this is a clear evidence that efficient particle acceleration is occurring there , which may have as well a radiative outcome at energies much higher than radio ones .    in the present contribution , based on recent multiwavelength observations and reasonable physical assumptions ,",
    "we show that massive protostars could produce a significant amount of radiation in the gamma - ray domain , because of the dense and rich medium in which they are formed .",
    "in recent years , synchrotron radiation has been observed from some regions where massive stars form .",
    "this emission is associated with outflows emanating from a central protostar . in",
    "what follows , we briefly describe some of these non - thermal radio sources that could be potential emitters of gamma - rays .",
    "the triple radio source associated with the protostar iras  16547@xmath24247 is one of the best candidates to produce gamma - rays .",
    "this system is located within a very dense region ( i.e. densities @xmath3",
    "@xmath4 ) of a giant molecular cloud located at a distance of 2.9  kpc .",
    "the luminosity of the iras source is @xmath5 , possibly being the most luminous known yso associated with collimated thermal jets .",
    "atca and vla observations ( garay et al . 2003 , rodrguez et al . 2005 ) have shown that the southern lobe of this system , of size @xmath6  cm , has a clear non - thermal spectrum , with an index @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the specific flux of this source is 2  mjy at 14.9  ghz and the estimated magnetic field is @xmath9  g ( araudo et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the serpens molecular cloud is located at a distance of @xmath10 300 pc .",
    "one of the two central dense cores of this cloud is a triple radio source , composed by a central protostar ( iras  18273@xmath20113 ) and two lobes .",
    "the northwest ( nw ) hot - spot is connected with the central source by a highly collimated thermal jet , whereas the southeast ( se ) is separated and broken into two clumps .",
    "the luminosity of the source iras  18273@xmath20113 is @xmath11 and the particle density at the center of the molecular cloud is @xmath12 @xmath4 .",
    "the observed radio emission ( rodrguez et al . 1989 , curiel et al . 1993 ) detected from the central and nw sources has a spectral index @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "this emission , of a luminosity @xmath15  mjy , is produced via thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "however , the radiation produced in the se lobe seems to be non - thermal ( @xmath16 ) , likely produced via synchrotron emission .",
    "the specific flux of this source is @xmath17  mjy .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field estimated in the se lobe is @xmath18  g ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "the famous herbig - haro objects called hh  80@xmath281 are the south component of a system of radio sources located in the sagitarius region , at a distance of 1.7 kpc .",
    "the central source has been identified with the luminous ( @xmath19 ) protostar iras  18162@xmath22048 .",
    "hh  80 north is the northern counterpart of hh  80@xmath281 . the velocity of the jet has been estimated as @xmath20  km  s@xmath21 , allowing to derive a dynamical age for the system similar to 4000  yr .",
    "radio observations carried out with the vla instrument ( mart et al .",
    "1993 ) showed that the central source has a spectral index @xmath22 , typical of free - free emission , whereas hh  80@xmath281 and hh  80 north are likely non - thermal sources , with spectral index @xmath23 . the specific flux measured at a frecuency of 5 ghz",
    "is @xmath24  mjy and @xmath25  mjy for the sources hh  80@xmath281 and hh  80 north , respectively . at this frecuency , the angular size of the north and the south components are @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , the hh  80@xmath281 system is a source of thermal x - rays with a luminosity @xmath27  erg  s@xmath21 ( pravdo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "another interesting source to study is the system composed by an h@xmath28o maser complex and the turner - welch ( tw ) source in the w3 region ( wilner et al .",
    ". the central source of this system is a very luminous ( @xmath29 ) yso and the mean density of cool particles is @xmath30  @xmath4 .",
    "the distance to w3(oh ) is 2.2  kpc .",
    "continuum radio observations ( wilner et al . 1999 ) show the presence of a sinuous double - sided jet , emanating from the tw source .",
    "the observed radio flux , from 1.6 to 15 ghz , is in the range 2.5 - 0.75 mjy , and the spectral index of the observed emission is clearly non - thermal : @xmath31 .",
    "the inhomogeneous synchrotron model proposed by reid et al .",
    "( 1995 ) predicts for the emitting jet a density of relativistic electrons @xmath32",
    "@xmath4 and a magnetic field",
    "@xmath33  g , where @xmath34  cm , and @xmath35 and @xmath0 are the distance to the jet origin and the electron lorentz factor , respectively . unlike in the previous cases , here the non - thermal radio emission comes from the jet and not from its termination region .",
    "non - thermal jets associated with a yso are uncommon .",
    "the non - thermal radio emission observed in some massive star forming regions is interpreted as synchrotron radiation produced by the interaction of relativistic electrons with the magnetic field present in the cloud , being typically @xmath36 ( crutcher 1999 ) .",
    "these particles could be accelerated at a shock , formed in the point where the jet terminates , via diffusive shock acceleration ( drury 1983 ) .",
    "the acceleration efficiency , characterized by @xmath37 , is related to the velocity of the shock . using the values of the velocities given for the sources described in the previous section , and assuming bohm diffusion , values for @xmath37 of @xmath38",
    "are obtained .",
    "particles accelerated up to relativistic energies interact with the different fields present in the medium . as noted at the beginning of this section , electrons radiate synchrotron emission under the ambient magnetic field @xmath39 . in addition ,",
    "particles , electrons and protons , can also interact with the cold matter in the jet termination region ( via relativistic bremsstrahlung the leptons , and inellastic proton - nuclei collisions the protons ) .",
    "in addition , electrons interact with the background field of ir photons of the protostar , of energy density @xmath40 , through inverse compton ( ic ) scattering .    using the following parameter values : @xmath41  @xmath4 ; @xmath42  g ; and @xmath43  erg  @xmath4 given for iras  16547@xmath24247 ( garay et al .",
    "2003 , araudo et al .",
    "2007 ) , we estimate the cooling time of the main leptonic processes in this scenario . as seen in figure [ fig1 ] , relativistic bremsstrahlung losses are dominant up to @xmath44  gev .",
    "in addition , it is possible to see from this figure that the maximum energy achieved by electrons is @xmath45  tev and is determined by synchrotron losses , being ic losses negligible .",
    "protons can be accelerated by the shock in the same way as electrons and interact with cold particles present in the cloud .",
    "the maximum energy achieved by protons is higher , @xmath46  tev , and determined by the size of the acceleration region . in @xmath47 interactions , besides @xmath0-rays , secondary electron - positron pairs are produced .",
    "the maximun energies of these leptons is @xmath48  tev .",
    "these secondary particles will radiate by the same mechanisms as primary electrons ( i.e. synchrotron radiation , ic scattering and relativistic bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "in order to calculate the non - thermal spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a massive protostar , the magnetic field of the cloud and the distributions of relativistic particles , @xmath49 , are needed . to obtain the magnetic field @xmath39 and the normalization constants of the particle distributions , we use the standard equations given by ginzburg & syrovatskii ( 1964 ) for the observed synchrotron flux and assume equipatition between the magnetic and the relativistic particle energy densities : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the energy density of relativistic electrons , protons and secondary pairs , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ equip ] ) , the following relationships are implicit : @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the constant @xmath56 is a free parameter of the model , that characterizes how much energy goes to the different types of accelerated particles and @xmath57 can be estimated using the average ratio of the number of secondary pairs to @xmath58-decay photons as in kelner et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , we show the computed broadband seds for the parameters of the source iras  16547@xmath24247 , in the cases with @xmath59 ( equipartition between protons and electrons ) and @xmath60 ( larger acceleration efficiency in protons than in electrons ) . as seen from these figures , in the former case the leptonic emission is dominated by the primary electron population and in the latter by the secondary pairs .",
    "the typical lepton luminosities are @xmath61 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "regarding the hadronic emission , the luminosity produced by @xmath58-decay is higher in the case @xmath60 , reaching a value of @xmath62 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "in this work we show that , if the source is located at few kpc , the high - energy emission may be detected by glast and even by forthcoming cherenkov telescope arrays after long enough exposure .",
    "this opens a new window to the study of star formation and related processes . also",
    ", determinations of the particle spectrum and its high - energy for different sources with a variety of environmental conditions can shed light on the properties of galactic supersonic outflows , and on the particle acceleration processes occurring at their termination points .",
    "radio observations already demonstrate that relativistic electrons are produced in some sources . according to the presence of non - thermal emission detected at cm - wavelengths and ir observations of the protostar emission we can suggest several good candidates to be targeted by glast . these objects are iras  16547@xmath24247 ( araudo et al .",

    "1999 ) .    to conclude",
    ", we emphasize that massive yso with bipolar outflows and non - thermal radio emission can form a new population of gamma - ray sources that could be unveiled by the next generation of @xmath0-ray instruments .",
