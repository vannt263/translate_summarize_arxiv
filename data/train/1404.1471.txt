    "lagrangian methods in filtration theory , for example , rely on calculating the trajectory of individual particles in simplified representations of the pore space @xcite .",
    "particle capture by single cylindrical and spherical collectors is investigated to understand filtration in fibrous media and packed beds , respectively @xcite . in many filtration methods , such as deep bed filtration ,",
    "the particles are typically smaller than the characteristic scale of the pores , and get collected or deposited onto the obstacles in their path . in order to gain insight into these systems ,",
    "several studies have focused on the trajectories followed by small particles near large spherical or cylindrical collectors @xcite .",
    "trajectory studies have also shown that not only particle capture but transit times may also be dominated by single particle - obstacle interactions @xcite .",
    "other studies modelling particle transport in porous media have focused on the similar problem of the trajectory followed by individual particles as they move through narrow channels , such as in the constricted - tube model @xcite .",
    "studies of particle migration , dispersion and capture using eulerian methods also rely on calculating the detailed particle - fibre or particle - grain interactions in model porous media @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the properties of particle trajectories as the particles move past a fixed spherical or cylindrical obstacle driven by either a constant force or a uniform velocity field in the presence of particle - obstacle hydrodynamic interactions and for arbitrary particle - to - obstacle size ratios .",
    "recently , with the advent of microfluidic technology , there is a renewed interest in the understanding and characterization of the motion of individual particles past solid obstacles .",
    "the possibility of designing the stationary media with nearly arbitrary geometry and chemistry , with features of micron and sub - micron size , has led to microfluidic separation techniques that are primarily based on the species - specific particle - obstacle interactions . in deterministic lateral displacement ,",
    "for example , a mixture of suspended particles driven through a two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic array of cylindrical obstacles spontaneously fractionates as different species migrate in different directions @xcite .",
    "the migration angle depends on the particle - obstacle interactions , and can be accurately described based on the trajectory followed by individual particles as they move past a fixed obstacle @xcite .",
    "particle - obstacle interactions are also essential in separation methods based on ratchet effects induced by asymmetric arrays of obstacles @xcite .",
    "other methods , such as pinched flow fractionation @xcite and some particle focusing systems @xcite can also be investigated from the perspective of particle - obstacle interactions and the effect that both hydrodynamic and non - hydrodynamic forces have on the trajectories followed by different species @xcite . in all cases , the individual particle trajectories or the asymptotic distribution of suspended particles as they are driven past",
    "spherical or cylindrical obstacles contains the information necessary for calculation of the relevant average transport properties , such as migration speed and angle .",
    "however , an analytical treatment describing these two aspects of particle motion has not been developed . in this work , we provide such an analysis , within the purview of low reynolds number hydrodynamics , wherein stokes equations are assumed to describe the motion of the fluid , and particle inertia is neglected .",
    "further , we consider the non - brownian regime , since in many applications  separation devices in particular ",
    "high throughput is advantageous , leading to a routine occurrence of high pclet numbers and the motion of the particles can be approximated as deterministic .",
    "in addition , the results derived here are of relevance to suspension rheology and flows , specially in active micro - rheology , where a probe particle is driven through a quiescent suspension of particles . in turn",
    ", we shall show that it is possible to extend analytical results established in suspension rheology to the motion of a spherical particle driven past a fixed obstacle",
    ". in suspension flows , each individual particle is moving through a random distribution of other spheres .",
    "furthermore , in the dilute approximation , the analysis of the relative motion ( and distribution ) between any two spheres of the suspension suffices to characterize its properties .",
    "such a relative motion is analogous to the problem of a sphere moving with respect to a fixed obstacle in  say , for example  a microfluidic device .",
    "( note that in the latter case the dilute approximation assumes not only a dilute suspension but also that the distance between obstacles is sufficiently large . ) therefore , before proceeding , it is convenient to briefly review some of the most relevant results concerning two - particle interactions in the limit of zero reynolds and infinite pclet numbers .",
    "@xcite first obtained the pair distribution function of spheres in a sheared suspension .",
    "batchelor later extended his work by deriving the pair - distribution function in the case of a sedimenting polydispersed suspension of spheres @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the resulting expression for the pair distribution function to analyze the hydrodynamic diffusion of a sphere sedimenting through a dilute suspension of neutrally buoyant particles .",
    "@xcite further employed the same pair distribution function to study the apparent viscosity experienced by a sphere moving through a quiescent suspension .",
    "they considered both the micro - rheological setting of a ` falling ball viscometer ' as well as a non - rotating sphere moving with a prescribed velocity through the suspension .",
    "@xcite studied the motion of a single brownian particle through a suspension , and extended the analysis of @xcite to obtain the pair - probability distribution function for finite pclet numbers .    in this work , we consider the trajectory followed by a suspended particle driven by a constant external force ( e.g. buoyancy force ) or a uniform velocity field as it moves past a fixed sphere or cylinder in the limit of zero reynolds and infinite pclet numbers .",
    "we derive an expression for the minimum particle - obstacle separation attained during the motion , as a function of the incoming impact parameter between the sphere trajectory and the centre of the obstacle ( offset @xmath0 in figure [ fig : schematicrepresentation ] ) .",
    "the minimum distance between the particle and obstacle surfaces , that would result from a trajectory determined solely based on hydrodynamic interactions , dictates the relevance of short - range non - hydrodynamic interactions such as van der waals forces , surface roughness ( solid - solid contact ) , etc .",
    "in fact , the resulting scaling relation derived for small @xmath0 shows that extremely small surface - to - surface separations would be common during the motion of a particle past a distribution of periodic or random obstacles .",
    "this highlights the impact that short - range non - hydrodynamic interactions could have in the effective motion of suspended particles . in this context",
    ", we further demonstrate that the particle attains smaller surface - to - surface separations from the obstacle when confined in a channel , with walls parallel to the direction of motion of the particle .",
    "we also calculate the distribution of particles around a fixed obstacle in the dilute limit , by extending the existing analytical treatment in the case of sheared suspensions .",
    "we show that the steady state distribution is isotropic , which is a somewhat surprising result given the anisotropy induced by the driving field , but it is analogous to the distribution obtained in the cases of sheared and sedimenting suspensions investigated by batchelor @xcite .",
    "the steady state distribution of particles provides the necessary information to obtain macroscopic transport properties , such as the average velocity of the suspended particles , from the pore - scale point - wise velocity @xcite .",
    "the organisation of the article is as follows : in the next section we formulate the problem , describe the relevant geometries and briefly summarise the available results for the mobility functions corresponding to these geometries . in ",
    "[ sec : steadystatedistrib ] we derive the particle - obstacle pair - distribution function in terms of the mobility functions , and consider the limiting cases of nearly touching particle - obstacle pairs (  [ subsec : smallxipdf ] ) as well as widely separated pairs (  [ subsec : largexipdf ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : trajectoryanalysis ] we derive an expression for the minimum surface - to - surface separation attained during the course of motion of a particle around an obstacle .",
    "the derivation follows two distinct paths outlined in ",
    "[ subsec : trajanaleuler ] and  [ subsec : trajanallagrange ] ; the former follows an eulerian approach by deriving the expression using the probability distribution obtained in the preceding section , while the latter arrives at the same expression using a lagrangian approach by calculating the particle trajectory .",
    "then in  [ subsec : smallxi ] , we discuss the scaling of the minimum surface - to - surface separation in the limiting case of particles nearly touching the obstacle due to small incoming impact parameters . finally , in  [",
    "sec : hydsurfrghnss ] , we present a possible application of the relationship between the minimum separation and the incoming impact parameter to determine an effective hydrodynamic surface roughness .",
    "as discussed before , we intend to characterise the deterministic transport of a dilute suspension of spherical particles through an array of obstacles . here",
    ", we refer to a dilute suspension in the sense that the particle - particle hydrodynamic interactions within the suspension can be neglected . in the case of an unbounded suspension , this approximation is accurate for particle volume fraction below @xmath1 @xcite . in the case of a suspension under geometric confinement , such as in a microfluidic device ,",
    "the confinement screens the particle - particle hydrodynamic interactions , and higher volume fractions might still be accurately described by the dilute limit approximation .",
    "in addition , we assume that the obstacles are sufficiently separated that particles interacts with only one obstacle at any instant .",
    "that is , we consider the situation in which a single particle negotiates an isolated fixed obstacle . in order to obtain the steady - state distribution of particles we shall assume that the incoming particles in suspension are spatially uncorrelated , i.e.",
    ", they follow a uniform distribution far away from the obstacle .",
    "in addition , we neglect the effect of both fluid and particle inertia ( zero reynolds and stokes numbers ) , as well as the brownian motion of the suspended particles ( infinite pclet number ) .",
    "this leads to the consideration of pair hydrodynamic interactions between the suspended particle and a solid obstacle in the stokes regime .",
    "we investigate the effect of the driving field ( either a constant force or a uniform ambient velocity field ) , the obstacle type ( either cylindrical or spherical ) , and the particle - obstacle aspect ratio . from a lagrangian perspective",
    "we are interested in the trajectory followed by individual particles and , in particular , the distance of closest approach , @xmath2 , as a function of the incoming impact parameter , @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig : schematicrepresentation ] for a schematic representation ) . from an eulerian perspective we are interested in the distribution of particles around the fixed obstacles .",
    "note that in the problem considered here , the single - particle probability density around a fixed obstacle is analogous to the two - particle probability or pair distribution function in the case of suspension flows .",
    "a schematic view of the problem under investigation is depicted in figure [ fig : schematicrepresentation ] . a suspended sphere of radius @xmath3 moves towards the obstacle parallel to one of the cartesian coordinate axes , say the @xmath4-axis , from @xmath5 . an obstacle of radius @xmath6 ( spherical or cylindrical ) is held fixed with its centre at the origin of coordinates .",
    "the centre - to - centre separation is given by the radial coordinate @xmath7 , and the corresponding surface - to - surface separation , nondimensionalised by the mean of the two radii is @xmath8 .",
    "the minimum ( dimensionless ) separation reached between the surfaces , @xmath9 , occurs when the particle crosses the plane of symmetry perpendicular to the @xmath4-axis .",
    "we refer to the initial perpendicular distance between the line of motion and the @xmath4-axis as the _ incoming impact parameter _ and denote it by @xmath0 ( it corresponds to the far upstream @xmath10-coordinate of the particle , as @xmath11 ) .",
    "the motion is assumed to be caused by a uniform vector field @xmath12 acting on the sphere , which can be a constant body force ( @xmath13 , say , gravity ) or a uniform incoming velocity field far from the obstacle ( @xmath14 ) . in either case , the sphere is torque free .",
    "we note that in the case of a spherical obstacle , the symmetry of the problem results in the planar motion of the suspended particle .",
    "the centre of the particle moves in the plane formed by @xmath12 and the radial position vector at any time , and the problem is axisymmetric ( the unit vector in the radial direction is indicated by @xmath15 as shown in figure [ fig : schematicrepresentation ] ; the plane of motion is the @xmath16- plane in the figure ) . in the case of a cylindrical obstacle , the motion of the particle parallel to the axis of the cylinder",
    "is decoupled from that perpendicular to the axis , due to translational symmetry . here",
    ", we only consider the planar motion that occurs in the absence of a velocity component along the axis of the cylinder .",
    "further , since the driving field @xmath12 points along the positive @xmath4-axis , all trajectories in the problem are open , extending to infinity in both directions .     on the left represents the moving sphere , with a corresponding incoming impact parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the circle of radius @xmath6 with its centre at the origin of coordinates represents the fixed obstacle ( either a sphere or a cylinder ) .",
    "the empty circle represents the position of the suspended particle as it crosses the symmetry plane normal to the @xmath4 axis .",

    "the unit vector in the radial direction @xmath15 is shown , as well as the velocity components in the plane of motion .",
    "the surfaces over which the flux is conserved are shown , both far upstream ( @xmath18 ) and at the plane of symmetry ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the geometry is shown for the cases of a spherical and a cylindrical obstacle as indicated.,width=529 ]      in stokes flows , the velocity of the suspended particle @xmath20 is linear in the driving field @xmath12 , such that @xmath21 for an appropriate mobility tensor @xmath22 that depends on the geometry of the particle - obstacle system .",
    "moreover , since the particle motion is contained in the @xmath16-plane , the velocity can be decomposed into two mutually orthogonal components in that plane ; a radial component along @xmath15 and a tangential component perpendicular to it @xcite . then , given the symmetries of the system , the particle velocity can be represented as ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the identity dyadic , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are scalar functions of the separation @xmath7 ( or equivalently , @xmath17 ) , and also depend on the aspect ratio @xmath27 .",
    "it is well known that no analytical expressions are available for the radial ( @xmath25 ) and tangential ( @xmath26 ) mobility functions that are valid throughout the entire range of separations ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) .",
    "instead , it is a common practice to derive expressions in two limiting cases , the near - field ( @xmath30 ) and the far - field ( @xmath31 ) limits @xcite , and use some matching or interpolation procedure for intermediate separations .",
    "lubrication theory and multipole expansions ( equivalently , lamb s general solution , method of reflections ) are typically employed to derive mobility functions in the near - field and far - field , respectively .",
    "available results in these limiting cases are briefly discussed below , as it will be useful for subsequent derivations .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the mobility functions used in this work is presented in appendix [ appx : mobfunc ] .      for sufficiently small separations , lubrication theory yields the following functional forms for the leading order of the radial and tangential mobility functions : @xmath33 expressions are available for the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 above , for any generic pair of convex surfaces that can be approximated by a quadratic form @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite provide the following expressions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for a pair of spheres : @xmath36\\notag , \\\\",

    "we apply the same expressions to arbitrary ratios of radii to obtain : @xmath42,\\\\ b_1 & = \\frac{1}{6\\upi\\mu a}\\left[3\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right)^{1/2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in the case of a constant force driving the particle past a spherical obstacle , we use the far - field expansions of the mobility functions provided by @xcite to obtain the following expressions for the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 in powers of @xmath46 : @xmath47,\\\\ b(r )   & =   \\frac{1}{6\\upi\\mu a } \\left[1-\\frac{9}{16 } \\beta \\left(\\frac{a}{r}\\right)^2-\\frac{3}{8 } \\left(\\beta + 3 \\beta ^3\\right ) \\left(\\frac{a}{r}\\right)^4 + o\\left(\\frac{1}{r^6}\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] analogously , in the case of a uniform velocity field and a spherical obstacle we obtain , @xmath48 ,   \\\\",

    "finally , in the case of a constant force acting on a sphere moving past a cylindrical obstacle we use the following empirical far - field forms for radial and tangential mobility functions proposed by @xcite : @xmath50 here , we do not consider the case of a uniform velocity field driving a particle past an unbounded cylinder , since in this case , the description of the far - field motion in terms of mobility functions is not possible due to stokes paradox @xcite . in practice , however , the motion of the particle far from the obstacle would probably be dictated by the physical boundaries of the system ( e.g. the walls of the microfluidic device ) .",
    "a similar ` screening ' argument will become relevant when we discuss the far - field asymptotic probability distribution in  [ subsec : largexipdf ] . in order to understand the role of confinement",
    ", we shall consider the motion of a particle past a cylindrical obstacle between two parallel walls forming a channel of width @xmath51 .",
    "we shall assume that the particle moves in the mid - plane , driven by a constant force and thus the far - field mobility is dictated by the hydrodynamic interaction with the channel walls @xcite : @xmath52\\ ] ] as explained in appendix a , at intermediate separations we interpolate between this far - field mobility and the mobility of a sphere in the vicinity of an infinite cylinder .",
    "the latter is obtained by an interpolation between ( [ eqn : nitscheffa ] ) ( or ( [ eqn : nitscheffb ] ) ) and the lubrication regime discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : lubrproblem ] @xcite .",
    "from an eulerian point - of - view , we are interested in the steady - state distribution of particles around a fixed obstacle .",
    "the basic assumption in this investigation is that the particles are uniformly distributed far away from the obstacle , leading to a uniform flux of incoming particles at infinity .",
    "the probability density of finding a particle at a given position @xmath53 from the obstacle centre ( i.e. , the origin ) is then analogous to the pair distribution function studied in dilute suspensions @xcite .",
    "thus , we talk of the pair distribution function @xmath54 , referring to particle - obstacle pairs , with the fixed obstacle located at the origin and the particle at position @xmath53 .",

    "( bottom ) comparison between both flow cases for a spherical obstacle with @xmath60 and a cylindrical obstacle . ]    following @xcite , we start with the conservation equation for the number of particles , which in terms of the pair distribution function can be written as follows : @xmath61 then , we write the divergence of the particle velocity in terms of its radial component using ( [ eqn : velocityrepresentation ] ) , @xmath62u_r , \\label{eqn : velocitydivergence}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 equals @xmath64 or @xmath65 depending on the dimensionality of the problem ( see the discussion below ) . substituting this expression into ( [ eqn : fokkerplank ] ) we obtain , @xmath66 = p u_r \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{dq}{dr } = p \\frac{dr}{dt } \\frac{1}{q } \\frac{dq}{dr } = \\frac{p}{q}\\frac{dq}{dt } , \\label{eqn : definefuncq}\\ ] ] where , following @xcite we introduced a function @xmath67 defined such that @xmath68 is a constant of motion ( its material derivative is zero ) .",
    "this result is valid for both types of obstacles and both driving fields , with @xmath67 determined by the mobility functions specific to each case .",
    "further , @xmath68 is constant under both steady as well as unsteady conditions and , as a result , the distribution of particles at a position @xmath53 and time @xmath69 can be determined from a previous position of the same material point at a prior time . in addition , in steady state @xmath70 is constant along trajectories , which implies a stationary , radially symmetric distribution of particles ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) , a surprising result , but one that is analogous to that obtained by @xcite .",
    "an alternative way to arrive at the same result is to propose a function @xmath67 such that the field @xmath72 becomes solenoidal and therefore @xmath73 is constant along particle trajectories .",
    "we can obtain a solenoidal field by multiplying the velocity with a function @xmath74 of the magnitude @xmath7 only , which indicates an isotropic distribution of particles in steady state . finally , solving for @xmath67 and imposing the asymptotic limit @xmath75",

    "an infinitely long cylindrical obstacle naturally imposes a two dimensional geometry ( @xmath60 ) . however , there are two independent possibilities in the case of a spherical obstacle",
    ". first , the fully 3-dimensional ( 3d ) problem of a dilute suspension moving past a spherical obstacle corresponds to @xmath59 .",
    "the second problem corresponds to the case in which the suspended particles are restricted to move in the @xmath16-plane , i.e. , the plane of the paper in figure [ fig : schematicrepresentation ] .",
    "this simplification corresponds to @xmath60 , and is sometimes used to approximate the motion past a cylindrical fibre @xcite .    in figure",

    "the top plot shows that the distribution of particles around a cylindrical obstacle is almost five - fold larger than that in the case of a spherical obstacle with @xmath59 for a given separation from the obstacle .",
    "the distribution is observed to be less sensitive to the effect of the driving field ( spherical obstacle , @xmath59 ) , with that for the particles driven by a constant force being higher than when they are driven by a uniform velocity field .",
    "the same plot also shows a good agreement between our calculations for a spherical obstacle ( with @xmath59 ) and those of @xcite , for the case of a particle driven by a uniform velocity field .",

    "we compare the probability distribution around a cylindrical obstacle with that around a spherical obstacle when the incoming particles are restricted to move in the @xmath16-plane ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the distributions exhibit similar behaviour at small separations .",
    "however , we will show that the asymptotic scaling of the probability distributions in the limit of small separations is different for each geometry of the obstacle .",

    "the eulerian approach entails invoking the conservation of the number of particles entering and exiting the region defined by the revolution of the trajectory of a particle around the @xmath4-axis ( the region created by the translation of a particle trajectory along the axis of the cylinder in the case of a cylindrical obstacle ) .",

    ", it shows the volume of revolution obtained by revolving around the axis of motion ( @xmath4-axis ) the trajectory followed by a spherical particle moving past a spherical obstacle .",
    "the conservation of particles inside this volume of revolution takes a simple form , due to the fact that the flux of particles across the surface of revolution is zero ; since trajectories do not cross in stokes flow .",
    "( the construction of such a volume of revolution corresponds to the fully 3d case with @xmath59 .",
    "the 2d case with @xmath60 can be treated in a manner completely analogous to that of a cylindrical obstacle . )",

    "( note the excluded volume of radius @xmath128 ) .",
    "on the bottom right corner of the figure , we show the analogous case of a cylindrical obstacle , in which the flux is considered per unit length in the @xmath129-direction . in both cases",

    "it is interesting to note that it has the same _ form _ for the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( or , @xmath9 ) for two and three dimensional geometries , which can be explained by the fact that the motion is planar in both cases .",

    "we observe that for a constant incoming impact parameter , @xmath150 , the minimum attained separation decreases with increasing particle radius .",
    "however , an asymptotic analysis at very small separations reveals that for a given ( sufficiently small ) incoming impact parameter , the minimum separation decreases monotonically with decreasing particle radius .",
    "this can be corroborated from the behaviour of the exponent involved in the asymptotic scaling of the incoming impact parameter ( [ eqn : scalingequation ] ) shown in figure [ fig : exponentssmallxifuncbeta ] ( see  [ subsec : smallxi ] below for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the inset in the right hand panel of figure [ fig : betaallcomparejfm ] , in fact , portrays the imminent reversal of this trend in the form of the criss - crossing curves .",

    "it also shows that a constant force drives the particle closer to a spherical obstacle than a uniform velocity field .",
    "further , we show the case of an obstacle - particle pair confined between two parallel walls , when the obstacle is a cylinder and the walls are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder .",
    "this case is the most relevant to model the motion of a particle past a cylindrical post in a microfluidic channel . as explained in ",
    "[ subsec : mobfunclargexi ] and appendix a , at intermediate separations we compute the mobility of the particle in this system by interpolating between the mobility of a sphere moving along the mid - plane between the two walls @xcite and that for a particle moving close to an infinite cylinder @xcite .",
    "we observe that the presence of such confinement , as well as increasing the extent of the confinement from 10 particle radii to 6 particle radii , decreases the attained minimum separation for a given incoming impact parameter .",
    "the underlying reason is that , in the far - field , the mobility is isotropic in the plane of motion and , therefore , the motion of the particle is not affected by the obstacle .",
    "the interaction with the obstacle becomes significant for particle - obstacle separations of the order of the channel width .",
    "thus , for a narrower channel , the particle reaches closer to the obstacle before its mobility is affected by the presence of the obstacle .",
    "the minimum separation attained by the particle along its trajectory determines the relevance of short - ranged repulsive forces during its motion .",
    "thus , in terms of the effect of confinement , the above observation implies that the particle will experience an earlier onset of non - hydrodynamic effects upon confinement between two parallel walls .      here",
    ", we calculate the asymptotic behaviour of the relation ( [ eqn : governingrelation ] ) in the limit of very small separations , in a manner similar to that discussed in ",

    "the behaviour of the exponent @xmath154 is depicted in figure [ fig : exponentssmallxifuncbeta ] .",
    "as discussed earlier , we can see from the behaviour of the exponent that for incoming imapct parameters small enough to follow ( [ eqn : scalingequation ] ) , the minimum separation decreases monotonically with decreasing particle radius .    however , the asymptotic form of the tangential resistance function @xmath155 , derived using ( [ eqn : mobfunclubrb ] ) , is only logarithmically divergent , and valid only when extremely small separations are attained .",
    "thus , for reasonably small values of @xmath9 , albeit @xmath156 , the expression ( [ eqn : scalingequation ] ) is not an accurate approximation .",
    "therefore , in addition to the leading order of the scalar resistance functions from which @xmath157 is obtained by matrix inversion , we also retain their @xmath39 terms .",
    "consequently , the tangential mobility function takes the form : @xmath158 we continue to use ( [ eqn : mobfunclubra ] ) as an approximation for the radial mobility function , so that @xmath159 .",

    "[ fig : scalingequationcompare ] , we compare the limiting behaviour given by ( [ eqn : improvedscaling ] ) , with @xmath162 as the only fitting parameter , with the numerical evaluation of the governing relation ( [ eqn : governingrelation ] ) , and observe that there is excellent agreement over a considerable range of separations .    ) compared with full governing relation ( [ eqn : governingrelation ] ) when a particle is driven by a constant driving force past a spherical obstacle for radius - ratios @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",

    "we obtained @xmath169 and for the case of uniform flow ( * ) @xmath170 . ]",
    "using ( [ eqn : governingrelation ] ) it is straightforward to extend the concept of _ hydrodynamic surface roughness _",
    "( henceforth , hr ) of spheres introduced by @xcite , to the motion of a suspended particle past a fixed obstacle . in their original work , @xcite related the time taken by a sphere to fall away from a flat surface under the action of gravity to an effective surface roughness . in our case",
    ", we can establish a relationship between the net lateral displacement experienced by a suspended sphere moving past an obstacle and the length scale at which surface roughness effects become dominant over hydrodynamic forces .",
    "this relationship is based on the simple but useful _ excluded - annulus _ model in which the inter - particle potential is approximated by a hard sphere repulsion with range @xmath171 @xcite . in this approximation",
    ", the effective roughness determines the minimum separation between particles but has no effect on the hydrodynamic interaction between them .",
    "such hard sphere potentials ( in some cases including tangential friction ) are widely used to model roughness effects on suspension properties , including micro - structure @xcite , shear - induced dispersion @xcite , sedimentation @xcite , rheology @xcite , and transport in periodic systems @xcite . in our problem",
    ", the excluded annulus model implies that , independent of the impact parameter @xmath0 , separations smaller than @xmath172 are unattainable due to the hard sphere potential . on the other hand",
    ", the repulsive potential has no effect as the particle separates from the obstacle .",
    "therefore , if @xmath173 is the incoming impact parameter corresponding to @xmath174 , any trajectory with @xmath175 reaches the same minimum separation @xmath176 and collapses onto the outgoing trajectory corresponding to @xmath173 , thus inducing a net lateral displacement of magnitude @xmath177 . in the case of a dilute suspension flowing past a fixed obstacle , this corresponds to the presence of a wake of width @xmath178 behind the obstacle , analogous to that observed by @xcite .",
    "the excluded - annulus model implies that the wake behind a fixed obstacle is related to the hr by ( [ eqn : governingrelation ] ) , @xmath179 alternatively , we can view the equation above as the definition of the hr , which serves as an effective hard - wall potential resulting from all non - hydrodynamic short - range repulsive interactions .",
    "the experimental measurement of @xmath180 would yield such length scale @xmath181 for deterministic systems with negligible particle and fluid inertia .",
    "a similar surface characterization method has been employed in the case of colloidal particles by numerically solving the particle trajectories @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that due to the presence of a diffusive boundary layer ( see  [ subsec : smallxipdf ] ) , ( [ eqn : governingrelationrghnss ] ) is valid for sufficiently large pclet numbers , such that the thickness of the boundary layer is smaller than the repulsive core , i.e. , @xmath182 .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the problem of a spherical , non - brownian particle negotiating a spherical or cylindrical obstacle in the absence of particle and fluid inertia .",
    "the particle is driven by a uniform ambient velocity field or a constant force acting on it , and its motion is entirely contained in the plane formed by the driving force and the radial vector joining the centres of the obstacle and the particle . given this planar nature of the motion and the symmetry of the problem , the particle velocity renders itself for decomposition into a radial component ( along the centre - to - centre line ) and a tangential component ( perpendicular to the centre - to - centre line ) , with the corresponding mobility functions being dependent on the centre - to - centre distance only .",
    "based on these properties , and extending an approach introduced by @xcite in the context of sheared suspensions , we have derived the steady - state probability distribution of particles around the obstacle , assuming a uniform distribution of incoming particles at infinity .",
    "we showed the distribution to be radially symmetric for both obstacle types and both driving fields , analogous to the isotropic pair distribution functions obtained in sheared suspensions , sedimentation and microrheology .",
    "the asymptotic form of the distribution funtions diverges at contact , suggesting the presence of a boundary layer around the obstacle in which brownian transport is not negligible ; existence of such a boundary layer has also been reported in the context of sedimenting suspensions and microrheology @xcite .",
    "in addition , the asymptotic distribution of particles close to the obstacle is similar for both driving fields , and depends only weakly on the dimensionality and geometry of the problem .",
    "further , our numerical results indicate that this asymptotic behaviour becomes dominant at small separations , highilighting the relevance of other ( non - hydrodynamic ) interactions .",
    "the other asymptotic limit , that of large separations , yields a divergent excess number of particles around the obstacle , suggesting that screening by other particles or container walls would eventually become important for the description of the distribution of particles far from the obstacle .",
    "we have also derived an expression for the minimum particle - obstacle separation attained in the course of motion , as a function of the incoming impact parameter , using both eulerian and lagrangian approaches .",
    "we have shown that a smaller minimum separation is attained by particles moving in a confined channel , and the separation decreases with the extent of the confinement .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour in the limit of small impact parameters ( particles nearly touching the obstacle ) shows that the minimum surface - to - surface separation decays exponentially ( with a negative power of the impact parameter ) .",
    "the exponent governing this asymptotic relationship varies monotonically with particle radius , and indicates that for a given obstacle size and sufficiently small incoming impact parameter , a smaller particle reaches closer to the obstacle than a larger one .",
    "further , the exponential nature of the relationship shows that extremely small surface - to - surface separations can be frequently encountered in the motion of particles through an array of obstacles , which , could easily lead to a dominant role of non - hydrodynamic interactions in microfluidic systems .",
    "interestingly , the exponential decay of the minimum separation as a function of the impact parameter is independent of the dimensionality of the problem and depends only weakly on the geometry of the obstacle and aspect ratio .    we would like to thank profs .",
