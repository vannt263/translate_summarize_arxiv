    "the primary goal of the megamaser cosmology project ( mcp ; braatz et al . 2009 ; reid et al .",
    "2009a ; braatz et al .",
    "2010 ) is to determine the hubble constant @xmath9 to @xmath10 3@xmath11 accuracy in order to constrain the equation of state parameter @xmath12 of dark energy .",
    "the key to achieving this goal is to measure accurate distances to galaxies well into the hubble flow ( 50 @xmath13 200mpc ) .",
    "a proven method to measure accurate angular - diameter distances involves sub - milliarcsecond resolution imaging of h@xmath14o maser emission from sub - parsec circumnuclear disks at the center of active galaxies , a technique established by the study of ngc 4258 with vlbi @xcite . throughout the paper",
    ", we will refer to such circumnuclear disks as `` megamaser disks '' and galaxies that contain such megamaser disks as `` megamaser galaxies '' . as the mcp discovers and images megamaser disks , an important result , in addition to the distance determination , is the accurate measurement of the enclosed masses of the massive dark objects ( mdos ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ; richstone et al .",
    "1998 ) at the centers of these megamaser galaxies .",
    "we assume that the mdos are black holes ( bhs ) and justify this assumption in section 4 .",
    "the vlbi plays a crucial role in measuring bh masses with high precision especially in galaxies with lighter supermassive black holes ( i.e. @xmath15 ) .",
    "the critical advantage provided by vlbi is angular resolution two orders of magnitude higher than the best optical resolution . for any given galaxy with a nearly constant central mass density of stars",
    ", @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the radius of the gravitational sphere of influence of bh @xcite .",
    "so , a factor of 100 increase in resolution permits measurements of masses up to @xmath19 times smaller .",
    "similarly , the central density limits that can be set are up to @xmath19 times higher , high enough to rule out extremely dense star clusters as the mdos based on dynamical argument ( see section 4 ) in most megamaser disks presented here .",
    "megamaser disks , such as the archetypal one in ngc 4258 , are usually found in the centers of seyfert 2 galaxies . because maser emission is beamed and long path lengths are required for strong maser amplification , the megamaser disks are observable only if the the disk is close to edge - on . in ngc 4258",
    "the disk is inclined @xmath1082@xmath20 and its rotation curve is keplerian to better than 1% accuracy , which makes the bh mass determination robust with very few assumptions .",
    "the megamaser disks are typically smaller ( @xmath210.2 pc in ngc 4258 ) than the gravitational sphere of influence of their supermassive black holes ( @xmath22 pc in ngc 4258 ) ; this guarantees that the gravitational potential is dominated by the central mass .",
    "applying dynamical arguments to the extremely high mass density @xmath23pc@xmath3 within the ngc 4258 maser disk can rule out a dense cluster of stars or stellar remnants for most of the central dark mass @xcite , implying that the measured central mass is dominated by a bh .",
    "the megamaser disk method for estimating bh masses has some practical limitations .",
    "first , finding megamaser disks is difficult , partly because detectable disks need to be nearly edge - on .",
    "only eight bh masses have been published based on measurements of megamasers : ngc  1068 @xcite , ngc  2960 ( mrk  1419 ) ( henkel et al . 2002 ; not based on vlbi ) , ngc  3079 @xcite , ngc  3393 @xcite , ugc  3789 ( reid et al .",
    "2009 ; mcp paper i ) , ngc  4258 @xcite , ngc  4945 @xcite , and circinus @xcite .",
    "second , some rotation curves are significantly flatter than keplerian , e.g. ngc 1068 ; ngc 3079 ; and ic 1481 @xcite .",
    "the origin of the flatter rotation curves in these galaxies is unclear .",
    "it could be caused by self - gravity of a massive disk , the presence of a nuclear cluster , or radiation pressure @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the measured enclosed mass of the disk could be significantly different from the actual bh mass .",
    "therefore , the key to measuring reliable bh masses using megamasers is to find megamaser disks that have well defined edge - on disks with keplerian rotation curves .",
    "over the past two decades , there has been substantial progress in detecting bhs and constraining their masses , especially in quiescent or mildly active nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "this rapid progress was mainly facilitated by the high angular resolution provided by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and by gradually maturing techniques for modeling stellar dynamics of galaxies .",
    "the number of bh detections has increased to the degree that the field has shifted from confirming the existence of bhs to comparing their properties with those of the host galaxies .",
    "one of the most discussed relationships found between bhs and host galaxies is the correlation between bh mass and the velocity dispersion of stars in the bulge ( ie , the @xmath16-@xmath24 relation ; ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) ; gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; gtekin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and references therein ) .",
    "it is often suggested that this relation is a manifestation of a causal connection between the formation and evolution of the black hole and the bulge . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "it is natural to assume that bulges , black holes , and quasars formed , grew , or `` turned on '' as parts of the same process , in part because the collapse or merger of bulges might provide a rich fuel supply to a centrally located black hole .",
    "however , the nature of this connection is still not well understood .",
    "clearly , accurate bh mass measurements in megamaser galaxies can help to improve our understanding of the @xmath16-@xmath24 correlation , especially at the low - mass end .",
    "we present high - resolution images and rotation curves of megamaser disks in six new galaxies and their bh masses .",
    "in addition , we re - analyze the bh mass in ugc 3789 using the data from @xcite and present the new measurement here . in section 2",
    ", we present our sample of galaxies , vlbi observations and data reduction .",
    "section 3 shows the vlbi images and rotation curves of the megamaser disks , followed by our analysis of bh masses . in section 4 ,",
    "we rule out compact clusters of stars or stellar remnants as the central dominant masses for the majority of the megamaser disks . in section 5 ,",
    "we compare results from other mass measuring techniques to our maser masses .",
    "the discussion of our main results is presented in section 6 , and we summarize the results in section 7 .",
    "a more in - depth discussion of the @xmath16-@xmath24 relation , including the new maser bh masses , is presented in a companion paper by @xcite .",
    "water masers have so far been detected in @xmath10 136 galaxies .",
    "most of the megamasers originate in agn @xcite and about 20% of them show spectra suggestive of emission from sub - parsec scale , edge - on , circumnuclear disks . in the mcp",
    ", we are currently conducting vlbi observations of six megamaser disks to determine the angular diameter distances to their host galaxies . while more data are needed to measure their distances accurately , the quality of the vlbi imaging is already good enough to measure precise central bh masses .",
    "in addition to the six galaxies for distance measurements , we also have vlbi data on the megamaser disk in ngc 4388 to measure the central bh mass , even though the data are not suitable for a distance determination .",
    "table 1 lists coordinates , recession velocities , spectral types , and morphological types for these seven galaxies .",
    "the megamaser galaxies in our sample were observed between 2005 and 2009 with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , augmented by the 100-m green bank telescope ( gbt ) and in most cases the effelsberg 100-m telescope .",
    "table 2 shows the basic observing information including experiment code , date observed , antennas used , and sensitivity .",
    "we observed the megamasers either in a phase - referencing or self - calibration mode .",
    "with phase - referencing we perform rapid switching of the telescope pointing between the target source and a nearby ( @xmath25 ) phase calibrator ( every @xmath10 50 seconds ) to correct phase variations caused by the atmosphere . in a self - calibration observation , we use the brightest maser line(s ) to calibrate the atmospheric phase . in both types of observations",
    ", we placed `` geodetic '' blocks at the beginning and end of the observations to solve for atmosphere and clock delay residuals for each antenna @xcite . for ngc 6323 and ngc 6264",
    ", we also placed a geodetic block in the middle of the observations to avoid the zenith transit problem at the gbt and to obtain better calibration . in each geodetic block , we observed 12 to 15 compact radio quasars that cover a wide range of zenith angles , and we measured the antenna zenith delay residuals to @xmath26 cm accuracy .",
    "these geodetic data were taken in left circular polarization with eight 16-mhz bands that spanned @xmath10 370 - 490 mhz bandwidth centered at a frequency around 22 ghz ; the bands were spaced in a `` minimum redundancy '' manner to sample , as uniformly as possible , all frequency differences between if bands in order to minimize ambiguity in the delay solution @xcite .",
    "we also observed strong compact radio quasars every @xmath10 20 minutes to 2 hours in order to monitor the single - band delays and electronic phase differences among and across the if bands .",
    "the errors of the single - band delays are @xmath27 1 nanosecond .",
    "we calibrated all the data using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . since the geodetic data and the maser data used different frequency settings , we reduced them separately .",
    "for the geodetic data , we first calibrated the ionospheric delays using total electron content measurements @xcite and the earth orientation parameters ( eops ) in the vlba correlators with the eop estimates from the us naval observatory ( http://gemini.gsfc.nasa.gov/solve_save/usno_finals.erp ) .",
    "we performed `` fringe fitting '' to determine the phases , single - band delays , and fringe rates of if bands of each antenna for every geodetic source , and the multi - band delay of each antenna was determined from these solutions .",
    "finally , we determined the residual tropospheric delay and clock errors for all antennas using the multi - band delays .",
    "we applied these corrections to the maser data as described in the next paragraph . in five datasets for ngc 6323 , we also made antenna position corrections before the fringe - fitting process when the positions used in the observation deviated from the latest usno ( http://rorf.usno.navy.mil/solutions/ ) solutions by more than @xmath10 2 cm .",
    "for the maser data , after the initial editing of bad data , we corrected for ionospheric delay and the eops in the same way as for the geodetic dataset .",
    "we then corrected the sampler bias in the 2-bit correlator .",
    "the amplitude calibration was done with the information in the gain table and the system temperature table .",
    "we corrected the interferometer delays and phases caused by the effects of diurnal feed rotation ( parallactic angle ) , and applied the tropospheric delay and clock corrections obtained from the geodetic data afterwards .",
    "the next step was to perform fringe fitting on one or two scans of the delay calibrators to calibrate the electronic phase offsets among and across if bands .",
    "the frequency axes of the maser interferometer spectra were then shifted to compensate for the changes in source doppler shifts over the observing tracks .    the final step in calibration was to solve for the atmospheric phase variation by using either phase - referencing or self - calibration . in the phase - referencing mode , we ran the aips task calib on the phase calibrator to determine the phase correction as a function of time for each individual if band . in the self - calibration mode",
    ", we either selected a single strong maser line or averaged multiple maser lines in narrow ranges of both velocity and space to perform phase calibration .",
    "the typical solution interval was 100 seconds .",
    "after the above calibrations , we discarded the phase solutions and the maser data in the time intervals within which the solutions appeared to be randomly scattered in time or had adjacent reference phases exceeding @xmath1050@xmath20 .",
    "the phase solutions were then interpolated and applied to all the maser data . in all phase - referencing observations for ngc 6323",
    ", we performed an extra step of self - calibration after the initial phase - referencing calibration , because the phase - referencing calibration alone did not give adequate phase calibration , and significant sidelobes were still visible after clean deconvolution .",
    "the calibrated data from multiple tracks of a single source were combined for imaging .",
    "we fourier transformed the gridded @xmath28 data to make images of the masers in all spectral channels of the if bands that showed maser lines , and we deconvolved the images using clean with a weighting scheme that optimized the position accuracy ( e.g. robust = 0 in the task imagr ) .",
    "we fitted the detected maser spots with elliptical gaussians to obtain the positions and flux densities of individual maser components . in table 3 we show a representative dataset that includes the velocities , positions , and peak intensities of the maser spots in ngc 6264 .",
    "the data for all galaxies are available in the electronic version of this paper .",
    "note that all galaxies except ngc 4388 and ngc 2273 have at least 2 tracks of data .",
    "therefore , the peak flux in table 3 is the flux for the averaged dataset .",
    "the actual fluxes in an individual epoch can be higher or lower because of variability of the masers .",
    "the sub - parsec megamaser disks presented in this paper are in a deep gravitational potential and the majority have recession velocities over 1% of the speed of light @xmath29 . for this reason",
    ", we made both special and general relativistic corrections to the maser velocities in the data before we used the data to analyze the bh masses .",
    "we made the relativistic corrections in the following way :    the observed local standard of rest velocities @xmath30 listed in table 3 are based on the `` optical '' velocity convention @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the observed frequency and @xmath33 = 22.23508 ghz , the rest frequency of the h@xmath0o 6@xmath34 transition .",
    "because of gravitational time dilation , the emitting frequency @xmath33 of a maser at distance @xmath35 from a compact object of mass @xmath36 and the actual observed frequency @xmath37 for an observer at @xmath38 differ by a factor @xmath39 for a maser in a circular orbit moving at speed @xmath40 , balancing the gravitational and centripetal accelerations gives @xmath41 , so @xmath42 we multiplied the observed frequency @xmath32 of each maser line by @xmath43 to correct for gravitational time dilation .",
    "the megamaser lines at the systemic velocities were also corrected for a transverse doppler shift @xmath44    the relativistically correct doppler equation for a source moving radially away with velocity @xmath45 is @xmath46    after the observed frequency had been corrected for the gravitational time dilation and transverse doppler shift , we used equation  [ reldopeq ] to convert the corrected frequency to its relativistically correct radial velocity @xmath45 . for the megamaser disks , typically @xmath47 .",
    "so , for galaxies in the hubble flow ( @xmath48 ) , the general relativistic corrections are smaller than the special relativistic corrections . for example , for masers in ugc 3789 , which has an optical - lsr recession velocity of 3262 km  s@xmath49 , the special relativistic corrections range from 10 to 26 km  s@xmath49 whereas the general relativistic corrections range from 0 to @xmath10 2 km  s@xmath49 .    finally , when fitting the rotation curves , we used the relativistic formula for the addition of velocities to decompose the observed @xmath50 value of each maser spot into a common @xmath51 associated with the radial velocity of the center of each megamaser disk and an individual @xmath52 associated with orbital motion of a specific maser spot .",
    "the redshifted maser spots have @xmath53 and blueshifted maser spots have @xmath54 .",
    "figure 1 shows the gbt single - dish spectra for all megamaser galaxies presented here except for ugc 3789 , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "figures 2 , 3 , and 4 show the vlbi maps and the position - velocity ( @xmath56 ) diagrams along with the fitted rotation curves of the maser spectral components ( spots ) in ugc  3789 , ngc  1194 , ngc  2273 , ngc  2960 ( mrk  1419 ) , ngc  4388 , ngc  6264 , and ngc  6323 .",
    "@xcite published the ugc 3789 vlbi map and the rotation curve , and we performed a new analysis of the bh mass for this galaxy based on those data .",
    "we show the vlbi map and rotation curve for this galaxy again for direct comparison with the other six megamaser disks .",
    "the data points in the vlbi maps and rotation curves are color - coded to indicate redshifted , blueshifted , and systemic masers , where the `` systemic '' masers refer to the maser spectral components having velocities close to the systemic velocity of the galaxy . except for ngc 4388 ,",
    "the maser spot distributions are plotted relative to the average position of the systemic masers .",
    "systemic masers are not detected in ngc 4388 , so we plotted its maser distribution relative to the dynamical center determined from fitting the data in the @xmath56 diagram with a keplerian rotation curve .    to estimate the inclination and dynamical center ( i.e. the position of the bh ) of each disk , we rotated the coordinate system to make the disk horizontal and used the fitted horizontal line that passes through the high velocity masers as the zero point of the y - coordinate of the dynamical center ( see figures 3 & 4 ) .",
    "the zero point of the x - coordinate is defined to be the unweighted average @xmath57 of the systemic masers .",
    "we assumed that the systemic masers have about the same orbital radii as the high - velocity masers to estimate the maser disk inclination cos@xmath49(@xmath58 ) , where @xmath59 is the average @xmath60 position of the systemic masers and @xmath61 is the orbital radius of the systemic masers . in principle",
    ", one can determine @xmath61 exactly only when good rotation curves for both systemic and high - velocity masers can be obtained , and precise acceleration measurements for the systemic masers are available . among our data we only have such information for ugc 3789 at this point @xcite , and",
    "so we use @xmath62@xmath63@xmath64 of high velocity masers as an estimate of @xmath61 .",
    "we note that all our megamaser disks with systemic masers detected have inclinations larger than 80@xmath65 , so assuming the disk is exactly edge - on will only cause errors less than 1% in the derived bh masses . in ngc 4388",
    "we could not measure a disk inclination , but even if the disk were 20  from edge - on , the contribution to the error in the bh mass would be only 12% , comparable to the 11% error caused by the distance uncertainty .",
    "we determined the rotation curve for each megamaser disk as a function of the `` impact parameter '' defined as the projected radial offset @xmath66 of the maser spots so that we can account for the warped structures in some megamaser disks .",
    "we then performed a nonlinear least - squares fit of a keplerian rotation curve to the position - velocity diagram with the assumption that the high - velocity masers lie exactly on the mid - line of the disk .",
    "in addition , the systemic velocity of each galaxy was fitted as a free parameter , and we report the best fits of the systemic velocities of our megamaser galaxies in table 1 .    the fitted keplerian rotation curves can be expressed with the following form : + @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the orbital velocity ( after relativistic corrections ) of the high velocity masers and @xmath69 is the orbital velocity at a radius 1 mas from the dynamical center .",
    "the bh mass is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the angular diameter distance to the galaxy .",
    "we show all the measured bh masses in table 4 .",
    "there are three major sources of error for our bh mass calculation , and the largest comes from the distance uncertainty . except for ngc 4388",
    ", we used the hubble distances relative to the cmb for a cosmological model with @xmath9 = 73 km  s@xmath49  mpc@xmath49 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath9 is uncertain by 8  km  s@xmath49  mpc@xmath49 @xcite , the galaxy distances will have an rms uncertainty of 11% .",
    "ngc 4388 is in the virgo cluster and has a large peculiar velocity , so we used its tully - fisher distance of 19 mpc @xcite .",
    "since the distance modulus used by @xcite is calibrated relative to the cepheid distances provided by the hubble key project @xcite and the systematic error of the cepheid distances is the primary source of the hubble constant uncertainty , we also adopted 11% as the rms distance error for ngc 4388 .",
    "the second source of bh mass uncertainty comes from fitting the rotation curves of the masers . in our keplerian",
    "fitting , the rms @xmath74 of the observed position offsets from keplerian rotation is usually larger than the rms position uncertainties of the data by a factor of 1.5 to 4 .",
    "this extra scatter can lead to a systematically different position of the dynamical center , and hence a slightly different bh mass if we allow dynamical center position to be a free parameter in the fit .",
    "this excess may indicate that we underestimated our observational errors or it may indicate genuine deviations from our simple model , possibly caused by peculiar motions of the masers ( e.g. perturbations from spiral density waves ) or high - velocity masers not lying precisely on the mid - line of the disk @xcite . if the latter is the main cause of deviation , we estimate that the majority of the maser spots fall within @xmath75 from the midline of the disk , depending on the galaxy .    in addition to the deviations of the masers from the midline of the maser disk",
    ", there is also an error in the bh mass from the uncertainty of the position of the bh in the fitting . to estimate this error , we relax our assumption on the position of the bh , and allow it to be a free parameter in the fitting",
    "however , since the recession velocity of the galaxy ( v@xmath76 ) and the position of the bh are correlated in this case , we impose a constraint on the possible positions of the bh such that the fitted v@xmath76 does not exceed v@xmath76 determined from other meothods ( e.g. hi measurements ) beyond their error bars . including all possible errors mentioned above",
    ", we estimate the total fitting error in bh mass to be 1%@xmath135% depending on the galaxy .",
    "the third source of error is from the absolute position errors of our megamasers .",
    "source position errors introduce an extra phase difference between maser spots having different frequencies ( velocities ) .",
    "the relative position errors scale with velocity offset from the reference maser feature @xcite , which may differ from source to source .",
    "since the bh mass is proportional to the size of the maser orbits , relative position shifts among masers introduce errors in the bh mass measurements . among our megamasers ,",
    "ugc  3789 , ngc  2960 , and ngc   2273 have the largest absolute position errors ( 10 mas ; see note ( h ) in table 1 ) .",
    "the resultant bh mass errors are @xmath77% , whereas this error is smaller than 0.3% in the other megamaser galaxies",
    ". please note that the error for the bh mass discussed in the following subsections does not include the distance uncertainty . only source position errors and errors from keplerian",
    "fitting are evaluated , which is the best approach for comparing our results with bh masses derived from other techniques as the same distance can be used for comparison . as the distance uncertainties shrink in the future ,",
    "so will the uncertainties in our bh masses .",
    "ngc 1194 hosts a seyfert 1.9 nucleus and has a distance of @xmath78 mpc .",
    "the position angle of the maser disk ( figure 2 ) is @xmath79 and the inclination is @xmath80 85@xmath20 .",
    "ngc 1194 has the largest maser disk among the megamasers presented here , with an inner and outer radius of 0.53 and 1.3 pc , respectively .",
    "the blueshifted and redshifted masers do not appear to fall exactly on a straight line on the sky , but they are consistent with a slightly bent thin disk .",

    "its edge - on maser disk lies at position angle @xmath86 east of north ( fig .  2 ) . although the high - velocity masers appear to trace a flat disk , the misalignment of the systemic masers with respect to the disk and the fact that the systemic masers have at least two distinct centripetal accelerations @xcite suggest that the disk is probably warped along the line of sight .",
    "the inner and outer radii of the disk are 0.085 and 0.32 pc , respectively . fitting the @xmath56 diagram ( fig .",

    "note that this mass is nearly the same as the mass given in @xcite , @xmath88 .",

    "the rms scatter of the high velocity masers normal to the disk is @xmath92arcsec , which is 1.6 times larger than the rms uncertainty of the data , so it is likely that either we underestimated the observational uncertainties because of larger tropospheric delay errors for low declination sources , or the thickness of the disk may not be negligible in this megamaser . in this galaxy ,",
    "we measure a bh mass of @xmath93 .",

    "it hosts a seyfert 2 nucleus and the maser disk ( figure 2 ) has a position angle of 107@xmath65 .",
    "we can not measure the inclination directly because no systemic masers were detected .",
    "as with the other megamasers , we assumed a flat , edge - on disk .    since no systemic masers were detected , we determined the position of the dynamical center by allowing it to be a free parameter when fitting the high - velocity masers with a keplerian rotation curve ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "in addition , we fixed the systemic velocity of the galaxy using an hi measurement @xcite .",
    "the resulting bh mass is @xmath94 . with only five maser spots mapped ,",
    "there is not sufficient data to demonstrate keplerian rotation or even to show that the masers actually lie on a disk .",
    "we argue that it is likely they do because the radio continuum jet shown by @xcite is nearly perpendicular to the line joining the blueshifted and redshifted masers .",

    "the channels averaged , the center velocities of the bands used for averaging , and the continuum upper limits are listed in table 5 .",
    "the near - keplerian shapes of the rotation curves of many circumnuclear megamaser disks allows one to determine the enclosed ( spherical ) mass within the innermost radius of the disk .",
    "while the enclosed masses of the megamaser disks are very likely dominated by supermassive bhs , as we assumed in the previous sections , it is still important to find ways to justify this assumption . the question of whether the enclosed mass can be attributed to a point mass or a compact cluster of stars or stellar remnants has been addressed by @xcite & @xcite .",
    "the main argument is that if the lifetime of a central cluster , limited by evaporation or collision timescales , is significantly shorter than the age of its host galaxy , then it is unlikely to persist , and a central supermassive bh would be required to account for the enclosed mass . here ,",
    "the evaporation timescale t@xmath103 ( @xmath104 is the half - mass relaxation timescale ; binney & tremaine 2008 ) is considered to be the upper limit of the lifetime of any bound stellar system whereas the collision timescale is the characteristic timescale that a star suffers a physical collision ( i.e. an inelastic encounter ; binney & tremaine 2008 ) .    to estimate the lifetime of the central cluster , we follow @xcite and assume that the central cluster has the plummer density distribution @xcite : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the central density and @xmath107 is the core radius .",
    "( the reason for choosing the plummer distribution is described in section 2.1 of @xcite )    we constrain @xmath106 and @xmath107 by fitting the position - velocity diagram of the megamaser disk with the rotation curve of a plummer cluster : @xmath108^{1/2}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath109 is the total mass of the cluster . here ,",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath107 are fitted as free parameters . from these two parameters",
    ", we calculated @xmath111 .",
    "in all cases m@xmath112 is very close to the `` enclosed '' mass measured from the keplerian rotation curve fit in section 3 , and the differences are less than @xmath113 . in figures 3 & 4 , we show the fitted plummer rotation curves along with the fitted keplerian rotation curves .    rather than using the method described above to constrain the core radius r@xmath114 , in some cases we could apply another approach that places even tighter constraints .",
    "we note that the plummer rotation curve does not decrease monotonically with radius ; instead the rotation curve turns over at a maximum rotation speed @xmath115 : @xmath116 having a maximum rotation velocity is not unique to a plummer cluster .",
    "it is a general feature for clusters having the same form of density profile with the exponent smaller than @xmath117 .",
    "the core radius @xmath107 of a plummer sphere having maximum rotation speed @xmath115 is @xmath118 we used equation 12 to estimate r@xmath114 for the megamaser disks in ngc 1194 , ngc 2273 , ngc 2960 and ngc 4388 . in these cases , we do not have very well - sampled or high quality rotation curves ( see figs .  3 & 4 ) ,",
    "so using r@xmath119 from equation 12 actually sets a tighter constraint on the core radius of the cluster than using rotation - curve fitting . for these four cases",
    ", we use the highest observed velocity in the pv diagram as an estimate ( lower limit ) of @xmath120 and use it to calculate r@xmath119 with m@xmath112 from the plummer rotation curve fitting from equation 10 . for ugc 3789 , ngc 6323 , and ngc 6264 , we used @xmath121 from rotation curve fitting because the qualities of the rotation curves are good , and they give tighter constraints on @xmath107 .",
    "in table 4 , we give the plummer model parameters for all of our megamaser disks .",
    "we constrained the lifetime of the plummer cluster @xmath122 by first requiring the cluster not evaporate in a timescale less than the age of its host galaxy ( @xmath123 gyr if the galaxy has formed before @xmath124 ) .",
    "this requirement sets an upper limit to the mass of the constituent stars of the cluster because evaporation is unimportant so long as the mass of its stars satisfies the following equation :    @xmath125^{-1 }   \\biggl({r_{\\rm h } \\over 0.01\\,{\\rm pc}}\\biggr)^{3/2 }    \\biggl ( { m_\\infty \\over 10 ^ 8 m_\\sun}\\biggr)^{1/2}~,\\ ] ]    where @xmath126 is the mass of each star , @xmath127 @xcite , and @xmath128 is the radius of half total mass ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "we call the maximum m@xmath130 that satisfies the above equation m@xmath131 ( table 4 ) and used it to calculate the collision timescale of the plummer cluster with the plummer model parameters : @xmath132^{-1}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the number density of stars , @xmath134 is the rms velocity dispersion of the stars , and @xmath135 is the stellar radius @xcite . if t@xmath136 @xmath27 10 gyr , then @xmath122 is constrained by t@xmath137 and we can rule out the plummer cluster as an alternative to the bh . if t@xmath137 @xmath138 10 gyr , we can not rule out a cluster whether @xmath122 is dominated by evaporation or collision . for ugc  3789 we obtained an upper limit @xmath139 to the mass of individual stars and a lower limit @xmath140 to the number of stars in the cluster .",
    "the mass limit directly rules out neutron stars as the constituents of the cluster , and only brown dwarfs , very - low mass stars , or white dwarfs are possible .",
    "if the constituents of the cluster are brown dwarfs , the collision timescale for our plummer model in ugc  3789 is @xmath141 years , much less than the age of a galaxy .",
    "the timescale is even shorter if the constituent stars are main - sequence stars .",
    "however , if the cluster is composed of white dwarfs , the collision timescale can be as long as @xmath142 years , but this is still much shorter than the lifetime of a galaxy .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a compact cluster is not likely to survive long , and the dominant mass at the center of ugc  3789 is a supermassive bh . for all other megamaser galaxies except ngc 1194",
    ", the lifetimes of the central clusters are also shsorter than the age of a galaxy ( table 4 ) . the constraints on lifetime",
    "weakly rule out massive clusters in ngc 4388 and ngc  6264 ( @xmath143 yr ) but strongly rule out clusters in the others ( @xmath144 yr ) .    in summary , by setting tight constraints on the sizes and central mass densities of possible plummer clusters ,",
    "we have been able to strongly rule out clusters as the dominant central masses in ugc  3079 , ngc   2273 , ngc  6323 , and ngc  2960 and weakly rule out the clusters in ngc   4388 and ngc  6264 .",
    "we argue that supermassive black holes are the dominant masses in these megamasers .",
    "together with the milky way galaxy , ngc  4258 , and  m31 @xcite , the number of galaxies with strong evidence to rule out a massive star cluster as the dominant central mass increases from three to seven .",
    "it is important to compare results from different methods for measuring bh masses , because such comparisons can provide insight into potential systematic errors for each method @xcite .",
    "comparing optically measured dynamical bh masses with those from the h@xmath14o megamaser method is especially valuable , since the megamaser galaxies with keplerian rotation curves provide the most direct and accurate bh mass measurements for external galaxies , these maser bh masses can be used to test the more commonly used bh mass measuring techniques in the optical , such as the stellar or gas dynamical methods .",
    "one can not meaningfully compare the stellar or gas dynamical bh masses with our maser bh masses unless the gravitational spheres of influence can be resolved .",
    "otherwise , even if the optically determined dynamical masses agree with the maser bh masses within the errors , the uncertainty can be too large to tell the real accuracy of the stellar- or gas - dynamical method .",
    "the angular diameters of the spheres of influence of our maser bh masses , 2@xmath18 ( table 4 ) , range from @xmath145 to @xmath146 . among these megamasers , only the spheres of influence in ngc 4388 and ngc 1194 can be barely resolved by the hst ( resolution @xmath147 at @xmath148 ) or the vlt assisted with adaptive optics ( resolution @xmath149 at @xmath150 m ) .",
    "therefore , of the galaxies here , stellar or gas dynamical measurements are feasible only for these two galaxies .",
    "we have obtained vlt time to measure the bh mass in ngc 4388 , and we will apply the stellar dynamical method to this galaxy and compare the bh mass to the maser bh mass in the future .",
    "another commonly used bh mass measuring technique is the virial estimation method @xcite .",
    "we are able to compare this technique with the megamaser disk method in four galaxies , and this is the first time that the virial estimation method is directly tested . in this method ,",
    "one estimates the bh mass as @xmath151 , where _ f _ is an unknown factor that depends on the structure , kinematics , and orientation of the broad - line region ( blr ) , @xmath152 is the radius of the blr , @xmath153 is the gas velocity dispersion observed in the blr , and g is the gravitational constant . here",
    ", we adopt the latest empirically determined @xmath154 from @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests that the virial method is accurate to a factor of @xmath155 . since we can not directly detect the blrs in megamaser galaxies that have seyfert 2 nuclei , we estimated @xmath153 using the scattered `` polarized broad lines '' ( pbl ) from the hidden blrs in those four megamaser galaxies with detected pbls : ngc 1068 , ngc 4388 , ngc 2273 , and circinus .",
    "we estimated @xmath152 via the @xmath156 correlation @xcite .",
    "table 6 shows the resulting virial bh masses for these four galaxies .    under the assumption that the observed linewidth of broad h@xmath157 or h@xmath158 emission approximates the `` intrinsic linewidth ''",

    "so , the scatter of the virial bh masses relative to the maser bh masses is comparable to the factor of 4 accuracy expected for the virial method .",
    "it is possible that the slightly larger difference between the maser and viral bh masses as compared with the expected accuracy for the virial method is partly caused by the larger intrinsic scatter in the @xmath160 correlation which we used here than that in the more generally used @xmath161 correlation ( e.g. kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ) in the optical .",
    "the application of the virial method to megamaser galaxies is described in detail in the appendix .",
    "table 4 shows the bh masses for all seven megamaser galaxies . along with the previously published bh masses from megamaser observations , it is interesting to see that the maser bh masses , except in circinus , are within a factor of 3 of @xmath162 , with the uncertainty of each bh mass @xmath163 12%",
    "this small range of masses could be a selection bias .",
    "disk megamasers are preferentially detected in seyfert 2 spiral galaxies , and since the local active bh mass function for seyfert 2 galaxies peaks at @xmath164 @xcite , we may be limited to bhs in this range of masses by analyzing disk megamasers .    our new maser bh",

    "these measurements play a particularly important role in constraining the @xmath8 relation at the low - mass end of known nuclear bh masses . in a companion paper ,",
    "@xcite find that the maser galaxies as a group fall significantly below the @xmath8 relation defined by more massive elliptical galaxies . as a result , the @xmath8 relation that fits later - type and lower - mass galaxies has both a larger scatter and lower zeropoint than the relation for elliptical galaxies alone .",
    "however , there is a potential caveat that measuring robust ( well - defined ) @xmath24 in late - type galaxies is challenging @xcite , and the contribution of systematic biases in @xmath24 to the deviation from the @xmath8 relation still needs to be explored in the future . with this caveat in mind ,",
    "the observed deviations from the @xmath8 relation at low mass imply that the relation may not be a single , low - scatter power law as originally proposed , and our bh mass distribution is consistent with the best simulations of galaxy growth regulated by `` radio '' feedback ; see figure  4 of croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "in addition to our seven galaxies with maser bh masses , we currently have vlbi datasets for another four disk megamaser candidates , and we are monitoring the spectra of more than six disk megamaser candidates that are currently too faint to be observed with vlbi , but may flare up in the future . along with these galaxies and more megamasers",
    "we may discover in the future with the gbt , we expect to obtain a larger sample of maser bh masses which could help to clarify the @xmath16-@xmath24 relation .",

    "* vlbi observations of circumnuclear megamaser disks are the only means to measure directly the enclosed mass and the mass density well within the radius of the gravitational sphere of influence of the central mass in these galaxies .",
    "the high central mass densities ( 0.12 to 60 @xmath166  pc@xmath3 ) ( within the central  0.3 pc ) of the seven megamaser disks indicate that in all , except one , disks , the central mass is dominated by a supermassive bh rather than an extremely dense cluster of stars or stellar remnants . * the bh masses measured are all within a factor of 3 of @xmath162 and the accuracy of each bh mass is primarily limited by the accuracy of the hubble constant , currently @xmath167%",

    "the virial estimation method for measuring bh masses in agns ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) uses the broad - line region ( blr ) gas as a dynamical tracer .",

    "since one can directly detect light from the blrs in type 1 agns , @xmath171 can be measured from the broad line spectra and one can use the continnum luminosity @xmath172 to estimate @xmath152 via the @xmath161 correlation ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in a type 2 agn , including the megamaser galaxies we study here , our line - of - sight to the blr is blocked by heavy dust extinction , so one can not directly measure @xmath173 and @xmath171 .",
    "instead , one can probe the blrs in megamaser galaxies with polarized scattered light and hard x - rays .",
    "among all the megamaser galaxies with measured bh masses , polarized scattered light from the blrs has been detected in ngc 1068 , ngc 4388 , ngc 2273 , and circinus ( see table 6 ) , and x - ray measurements are also available for these four galaxies .",

    "first , the broad h@xmath158 lines in the polarized flux spectra can contain a contribution from the narrow h@xmath158 lines . without removing the contribution from narrow lines ,",
    "the blr linewidth may be underestimated by @xmath1020 - 30% in ngc 1068 .",
    "second , the polarized emission from agns may originate from light being scattered by electrons with a temperature a few times @xmath176 k , which results in significant thermal broadening ( @xmath1050% ) of the spectral lines .",
    "because of these two effects , there will be systematic errors in @xmath171 if one directly uses the observed linewidth of the polarized lines to estimate @xmath171 . among the four megamaser galaxies we consider here , only ngc",
    "1068 has been studied in enough detail to remove these two effects .",
    "luckily , the two effects change the linewidth in opposite directions , and hence could offset each other to a certain extent . as in ngc 1068 ,",
    "if no correction is made for these two effects , the systematic error will be only @xmath1010% , just slightly larger than the measurement error . without knowing the actual contributions of these two effects for the other three galaxies , we assume that the two effects cancel each other to the same extent as in ngc 1068 and use the observed linewidths as the approximations for the intrinsic widths .",
    "the reader should be aware of this caveat when interpreting the comparisons made .    in this work ,",
    "@xmath152 was estimated from the `` intrinsic '' @xmath177 of the nuclear region via the @xmath178 correlation @xcite . since three ( ngc 1068 , ngc 2273 , and circinus ) of the four megamaser galaxies considered here are compton - thick",
