    "the influence of an environment on some relevant system degrees of freedom is often treated using open quantum system approaches @xcite . in these open quantum system models the environment",
    "is often modeled as an infinite number of harmonic oscillators that couple linearly to some system degrees of freedom .",
    "it is convenient to describe the influence of the environment on the system using a spectral density ( sd )  @xcite , which contains information about the spectrum of the environment as well as the frequency - dependent coupling . the definition of the spectral density starting from a microscopic system - environment model is briefly reviewed in appendix  [ sub_hamiltonian ] .",
    "the basic quantity entering the open quantum system approaches is the so - called bath correlation function ( bcf ) , @xmath0 which contains the spectral density ( sd ) @xmath1 as well as the temperature @xmath2 .",
    "we set @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "note that sometimes @xmath5 is denoted as the sd ( e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is more convenient for the interpretation of optical properties . we will come back to this point later in this work .    for many numerical methods ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) that handle these open quantum systems , it is important that the bcf can be ( at least approximately ) written as a _ finite _ sum of exponentials @xmath6 with time - independent complex prefactors @xmath7 and complex `` frequencies '' @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real numbers . although the bcf eq .",
    "( [ eq:_def_bath_correlation_function ] ) is also defined for negative times , it is usually sufficient to represent the bcf at positive times , since one can always calculate numerically the part for @xmath11 from the symmetry @xmath12 .",
    "typically , the numerical cost to calculate properties of the open quantum system grows rapidly with the number of exponentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_exp_bcf ] ) .",
    "therefore , the number of exponentials @xmath13 should be as small as possible .    for a general bcf an exact decomposition with a finite number of terms typically can not be achieved .",
    "nevertheless , one can use the function ( [ eq : def_exp_bcf ] ) as a fit function to the bcf trying to obtain a good fit with as few terms as possible . to this end",
    "one can use non - linear fit routines , which are availabe in many program packages , or use methods designed particular for this task , such as filter diagonalization @xcite .",
    "however , obtaining a direct fit of the bcf is in general not trivial , because the fitting routine might depend sensitively on the initial fit parameters ( see e.g.  also the discussion in ref .",
    "furthermore , it is often not easy to judge the quality of a fit of the bcf , since for different quantities that one wants to calculate in the end different properties of the fit are important , as will be discussed below .",
    "the fourier transform of the bcf eq .",
    "( [ eq:_def_bath_correlation_function ] ) contains the same amount of information as the bcf itself and is typically a function for which fitting is more intuitive .",
    "we have used such a procedure e.g.  in ref .",
    ".    however , one still needs a set of useful fit functions .",
    "furthermore , often one encounters the situation that an sd is given . using the procedure described above , one",
    "would , for a given temperature , first calculate the exact bcf , which is then either fitted directly by the sum of exponentials , or one would fit its fourier transform instead .",
    "besides the fact that direct fitting of these functions is not easy this has to be done for every temperature .",
    "it is therefore desireable to obtain the form ( [ eq : def_exp_bcf ] ) directly from the sd in a simple and transparent way . of course ,",
    "as before , one will in general not find an exact result and one needs to approximate the sd ( and the hyperbolic cotangent in eq .",
    "( [ eq:_def_bath_correlation_function ] ) ) with suitable functions ( some possibilities are discussed e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this work we present a class of fit functions for the sd , which allow on the one hand for an analytical calculation of the terms entering in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_exp_bcf ] ) and on the other hand for an inclusion of the relevant features of the sd in a clear way .",
    "our choice for the fit functions is motivated by the fact that approximating the sd by a sum of simple poles , together with a pole approximation of the hyperbolic cotangent , leads to a form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_exp_bcf ] ) .",
    "such pole expansions have been used in various contexts in the literature ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . when fitting the fourier transform of the bcf with simple poles it is ( similar to the direct fitting with exponentials ) usually difficult to obtain certain relevant behaviors of the sd / bcf .",
    "therefore , our fit functions are based on a representation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are polynomials in @xmath17 , and @xmath14 can be written as a sum of simple poles .",
    "our approach generalizes that of meier and tannor @xcite .",
    "meier and tannor parametrize an sd as a sum of anti - symmetrized lorentzians and take a few exact poles of the hyperbolic cotangent into account , which then leads to an exponential bcf . by anti - symmetrization of their lorentzian fit functions",
    "meier and tannor achieve a linear behavior of these functions at small frequencies .",
    "this is the so - called ohmic case .",
    "the class of fit functions presented in this work allows us to go beyond the ohmic case and enables us to model different low- and high - frequency behavior of the original sd in a transparent way .",
    "in particular we are able to treat the important case of superohmic sds , which are relevant , for example , for light - absorbing molecules ( either from experiment @xcite or theory @xcite ) or defect tunneling in solids @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there are qualitative differences between ohmic and superohmic sds for calculated open system properties ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "we will discuss this exemplarily for the case of linear absorption , where one clearly sees that a proper fitting of the low - frequency part of the sd is of great importance .",
    "our fit functions allow us to intuitively find good descriptions of fits that lead to the correct behavior of the spectra .",
    "this would be hard to achieve with fit functions that consist just of a sum of arbitrarily weighted simple poles . in the context of absorption spectra",
    "we will also see that for this situation @xmath5 is the relevant function for which a good fit has to be obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections [ sec : sd ] and [ sec : coth ] we suggest a class of fit functions for a given sd and introduce the expansion of the hyperbolic cotangent that we consider . in section [ sec : eval_bcf ] we state the analytical result for the bcf in the form of eq .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , our aim is to use fit functions for a given sd , that on the one hand allow us to represent the corresponding bcf as a sum of exponentials and on the other hand are in such a form that one can use them in an intuitive manner . to this end",
