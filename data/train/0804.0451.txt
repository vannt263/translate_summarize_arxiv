    "the magnetic field is @xmath39 . ]",
    "the moke responses of and for circularly - polarized pump excitation are qualitatively different .",
    "figure  4(a ) clearly shows that the initial transients in strongly depend on the pump polarization .",
    "they disappear within 1  ps , similarly to the transient reflectivity results,@xcite which are dominated by free photoelectrons . from this",
    "we infer that these transients are due to the spin - polarized electrons created in the conduction band , and their decay is due to electron trapping by defects , a non - radiative process characteristic for lt - grown materials.@xcite however , in the case of pumped with 0.62  ev light , no free photoelectrons are created .",
    "the fact that there is no trace of pump - polarization dependence in the probe response [ see fig .",
    "4(b ) ] strongly suggests that the optical orientation of photoholes is very quickly destroyed by hole spin relaxation , much shorter than the pulse duration used ( @xmath0  140  fs ) .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical simulations@xcite showing that fast ( @xmath010  fs ) spin relaxation of holes is necessary for explaining the observed magnitude of demagnetization .",
    "the magneto - optical response of ( iii , mn)v semiconductors below @xmath19 is caused by spin splitting of bands due to the ferromagnetic order , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the optical selection rules arising from spin - orbit coupling in the valence band of iii - v semiconductors then lead to different optical responses to the two circular polarizations of light @xmath40 . within the @xmath3-@xmath2 model of ferromagnetism,@xcite",
    "the band splitting @xmath41 is proportional to the average localized spin . in the static ( equilibrium ) case , only this band splitting in the ground state is probed , and the moke response is proportional to the macroscopic magnetization of the mn spins . in time - resolved measurements with _",
    "strong photoexcitation _ discussed here , holes excited by the pump can influence the magneto - optical response in other distinctly different ways .",
    "besides the splitting of bands , the moke signal is also directly influenced by state - filling,@xcite provided that the probe light couples to the states whose occupation was strongly modified by the pump .",
    "therefore , a selective pump - probe scheme can provide an opportunity to study the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hot carriers .",
    "for example , the previously discussed pump - polarization dependent transients in arise from the creation of spin - polarized photoelectrons in the conduction band , leading to the bleaching of transitions induced by the part of the probe beam co - polarized with the pump .",
    "one of our main observations for is the initial prominent overshoot behavior , which is not seen in .@xcite this is clearly visible in the @xmath29 traces for a linearly - polarized pump ( center ) in figs .",

    "can still bleach the probe transitions , but it is plausible that most of the initial states in the valence band contributing to the probe response are far away from those affected by the pump excitation , as illustrated in fig .  1 ( right ) .",
    "consequently , apart from the electron - related transient , the moke signal in arises from the changes in average mn polarization.@xcite on the other hand , in the case of ( see fig .  1 , left ) , the probe frequency was tuned near the peak of the static moke spectra of .@xcite the transitions responsible for this peak were most commonly assumed to involve final states in the conduction band,@xcite but in recent experiments other possibilities were discussed .",
    "final states in the dispersionless level close to the bottom of the conduction band were proposed.@xcite it has also been argued that most of the magnetooptical spectrum of at @xmath01.6  ev is dominated by transitions involving the intra - gap states.@xcite our findings support these interpretations , as our calculations of magnetooptical spectra of using the @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 band model@xcite agree qualitatively with the published measurements@xcite only for a very low hole concentration , @xmath46  10@xmath47  @xmath35 , which disagrees with the critical temperatures of most of the measured samples . in any case , the probe couples to electronic transitions for which the initial states are in the valence band , close to the fermi level .",
    "these are exactly the states whose population is strongly disturbed by the pump .",
    "taking into account that the holes relax their spin very quickly , we expect prominent , pump - polarization - independent dichroic bleaching in .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by results shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) .",
    "there are two possible sources for the dichroic bleaching signal observed in .",
    "the first is a simple blocking of transitions by photoholes added to the valence band , which diminishes the absorption @xmath48 for both circular polarizations .",
    "although @xmath49 is a complicated function of the optical constants of the material ( especially in the relevant case of reflection from a layered material ) , it is generally proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "when the two absorption coefficients are down - scaled by the same factor , the moke signal is suppressed .",
    "the second source of dichroic bleaching is the dynamical polarization of holes created in the process of demagnetization .",
    "the following scenario assumes that the kerr response of the probe corresponds not to the average band splitting ( proportional to the average mn spin ) , but to the average polarization of hot holes in the valence band .",
    "when the holes are very hot , the enhanced rate of @xmath1-@xmath2 scattering with the mn spins leads to the transfer of angular momentum from the localized spins to the holes .",
    "unless the hole spin relaxation is instantaneous , the nonequilibrium ( dynamical ) spin polarization of holes is created , i.e. , their average spin ceases to be proportional to the average mn spin .",
    "this is described by the equation for the dynamics of the average hole spin @xmath51 @xmath52 in which @xmath53 and @xmath1 are the densities of mn and holes , respectively , @xmath54 is the average mn spin , @xmath55 is the instantaneous equilibrium value of the average hole spin ( determined by @xmath56 and the band splitting @xmath57 ) , and @xmath58 is the hole spin relaxation time . the first term on the right hand side is due to the @xmath1-@xmath2 spin flip scattering , and it is responsible for the dynamical polarization of holes . if the second term was not efficient enough ( if @xmath58 was too long ) , the holes would get dynamically polarized to such a degree that there would be no more holes with the spin suitable for @xmath1-@xmath2 scattering with the mn spins .",
    "then the demagnetization process would cease .    for antiferromagnetic coupling between the mn spins and valence band electrons@xcite ( @xmath59 in the standard notation for dilute magnetic semiconductors )",
    ", spin - flip scattering between hot holes and mn spins leads to a _ decrease _ of the hole spin polarization , as shown in the schematic illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottleneck ] .",
    "therefore , assuming a finite hole spin relaxation time @xmath58 , the net spin in the valence band during the transient dynamics is actually _ lower _ than the equilibrium value corresponding to the instantaneous mn magnetization .",
    "let us mention here the existence of a competing process , in which the hot holes are simply relaxing their average spin towards the instantaneous equilibrium value @xmath55 [ the second term on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsdt ] ) ] . for values of parameters used in our calculations",
    "this enhances the effect due to the dynamical polarization .",
    "an important observation is that the assumption of @xmath60 leads to a natural explanation of the temperature dependence of the oveshoot feature in fig .",
    "[ power](b ) . at temperatures slightly below @xmath61 ,",
    "the initial mn polarization is very small . during the demagnetization ,",
    "the amount of angular momentum transferred from mn spins to holes is much smaller than at low @xmath28 , and the spin relaxation of holes can effectively suppress their dynamical polarization ( @xmath62 in fig .  [",
    "fig : bottleneck ] ) .",
    "the changes of @xmath51 due to relaxation towards @xmath63 are also suppressed at small values of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the disappearance of the overshoot before the vanishing of the real demagnetization can be qualitatively explained in this scenario .",
    "it is not so if we assume that the overshoot simply comes from strong bleaching of all the optical transitions , in which case it should remain visible at all @xmath64 .     being the chemical potential .",
    "the band is spin - split by exchange interaction with the localized spins .",

    "the full expressions and details of their calculation are given in ref .  .",
    "here we only need to know that the spin - flip rates @xmath70 are proportional to the temperature of holes @xmath56 .",
    "the equation for the dynamics of @xmath54 is coupled with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsdt ] ) for the dynamics of the average hole spin .",
    "finally , the temperature of holes after the end of the pulse is assumed to decay as @xmath71 with energy relaxation time @xmath72 .",
    "the fact that @xmath56 decays here towards zero instead of the final hole temperature ( which is about @xmath73  k ) is irrelevant for the dynamics during the first couple of picoseconds  after @xmath56 drops to about @xmath74 k the demagnetization becomes very slow and it does not matter for our purposes .     from 4  k to 1000  k right after the end of the pulse .",

    "we have used the spin relaxation time @xmath79 10 fs , and adjusted the energy relaxation time @xmath80 ps to fit the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : theory ] shows our calculated time - dependence of mn and hole spin polarizations after excitation .",
    "the mn spins demagnetize by @xmath020% , in qualitative agreement with the experimental data in fig .  2 , and the time - scale of the dynamical process ( demagnetization of mn and dynamical polarization of holes ) is limited by the energy relaxation time @xmath72  as @xmath31 decreases , the phase space available for hole scattering diminishes , and the efficiency of hole - mn spin - flip drops .",
    "the depolarization of holes exhibits a prominent overshoot , suggestively similar to the observed moke signal .",
    "thus , under our assumption that @xmath81 in gamnas , the dynamical polarization of holes can explain the observed temporal profile of the probe response .      the distinct overshoot behavior in , absent in , provides a clue for understanding the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of holes in ( iii , mn)v semiconductors .",
    "we attribute the partial recovery of the moke signal with a time constant of @xmath01  ps to the energy relaxation of highly - excited holes .",
    "it is important to note that much less is known experimentally about the ultrafast dynamics of holes than that of electrons , especially in a regime of strong excitation . in our case @xmath82",
    "@xmath35 hot holes are distributed in a very wide energy region ( comparable to @xmath83  ev , with an effective temperature @xmath31 of @xmath84  k after thermalization ) .",
    "this regime remains largely unexplored by experiments .",
    "let us reiterate that our @xmath72 is the characteristic time - scale of the _ initial _ large energy loss of the very hot holes , i.e. , the decay of their temperature from about @xmath85  k to @xmath86  k , with the latter value already corresponding to a slow demagnetization dynamics ( time - scale of tens of picoseconds ) . theoretical calculations of energy loss rates for high - energy holes suggest that such a highly - excited population will lose a significant part of its energy through phonon emission during the first picosecond,@xcite in agreement with our measurements .",
    "moreover , the picosecond energy relaxation of holes explains the rapid termination of the demagnetization process very well .",
    "we have observed photoinduced sub - picosecond demagnetization in . because of the disordered nature of",
    ", the midinfrared pump strongly excites the valence band .",
    "this leads to demagnetization of the mn spins , which proceeds as long as the holes are hot .",
    "we propose that the initial overshoot in the drop of the probe kerr signal is related to a strong excitation of holes near the fermi level , which bleaches the magneto - optical response of the probe .",
    "a possible scenario is the appearance of transient dynamical polarization of hot holes ( due to enhanced spin - flip scattering with mn spins ) . under assumption that the probe signal , at frequency of the transitions originating close to the fermi level , is dominated by average spin polarization in the valence band ( and not the average mn polarization ) , such a dynamical polarization leads to an overshoot in qualitative agreement with the observation . however , more work on understanding the equilibrium and nonequilibrium magneto - optical properties of is necessary in order to verify this interesting scenario .",
    "the subsequent sub - picosecond recovery of kerr rotation is interpreted as a signature of fast energy relaxation of holes .",
    "as expected , ultrafast demagnetization stops after this relaxation time .",
    "hole spin relaxation time much shorter than the pulse width is inferred from the polarization dependence , consistent with our previously proposed theoretical model .",
