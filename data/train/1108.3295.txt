    "in 2008 , we initiated a program of observations of giant radio galaxies ( grgs ) on the ratan-600 radio telescope . in december 2008 , we conducted a first set of observations and obtained integrated spectra for the components in seven radio galaxies : grg0139 + 3957 , grg0912 + 3510 , grg1032 + 2759 , grg1343 + 3758 , grg1400 + 3017 , grg1453 + 3308 , grg1552 + 2005 , and grg1738 + 3733 .",
    "these observations @xcite showed that the radio spectral indices of the components of these radio galaxies differ considerably .",
    "the form of the spectra also differs , from very steep , as in grg0139 + 3957 , to fairly flat , as in the components of grg1738 + 3733 .",
    "radio observations of grgs can help elucidate the origin of objects with such giant sizes , which is not yet entirely clear . according to the generally accepted definition ,",
    "grgs are radio sources with linear dimensions larger than 1 mpc .",
    "they are the largest objects in the visible universe , and it is possible that they played a special role in the formation of the large - scale structure .",
    "the large sizes of grgs also suggest that these sources must be at a late stage in their evolution .",
    "models of radio sources @xcite predict a change in the radio luminosity and linear dimensions of powerful radio sources with time . according to these models",
    ", grgs should be very old objects ( with ages > 108 years ) and should presumably be in a lower density medium compared to smaller sources with comparable radio luminosities @xcite .",
    "their analysis of radio and optical data ( sdss , apm ) for radio galaxies and quasars led komberg and pashchenko @xcite to conclude that , apart from environment effects , the sizes of giant radio sources could be explained by the presence of a population of long - lived , radio - loud active galactic nuclei , which , in turn , can evolve to grgs .",
    "multifrequency observations @xcite showed that the spectral ages of grgs are greater than is expected from evolutionary models .",
    "as was noted in @xcite , such radio galaxies could influence the formation of galaxies , since the pressure of the gas outflowing from a radio source could compress cold gas clouds and initiate the development of stars , on the one hand , and stop the formation of a galaxy , on the other hand .",
    "note that several teams @xcite-@xcite are investigating the origin of grgs and physical processes in these radio sources .",
    "however , thus far , there is no definite solution to this problem .",
    "our analysis of the spectra of radio galaxies in @xcite led us to the conclusion that the center - to - edge variation of the spectral indices for grgs is due to a change in the particle energy in the components ( this was also noted earlier in @xcite .",
    "this change is due to pressure variations in the surrounding streaming gas ; i.e. , to a change in the environment that depends on distance from the host galaxy . however , general conclusions will be more significant in an integrated approach to the grg population as a whole . an important stage in studying the origin of the large sizes of grgs",
    "is a comparative analysis of the properties of `` ordinary '' radio galaxies , also carried out in the framework of this project @xcite-@xcite .",
    "earlier , soboleva @xcite observed arcminute - size radio galaxies at centimeter and decimeter wavelengths on the ratan-600 , and found that their morphological structures have virtually identical spectral indices .",
    "therefore , studies of the remaining objects of the grg sample will enable us to supplement available information on the radio spectra of this population .",
    "we also noted that the millimeter - wavelength flux densities of the studied grg components estimated from extrapolated spectra are above 0.6 mjy @xcite .",
    "this could be relevant for estimates of the contributions of various effects to anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) on scales of galaxy clusters .",
    "thus , knowledge of the spectral indices , shapes , and orientations of grgs will facilitate taking into account features of regions with sizes of up to 10 on maps of the cmb anisotropy @xcite .    in the current paper",
    ", we continue our ratan-600 study of this grg sample and present new observations of these radio galaxies at centimeter and decimeter wavelengths .",
    "the observations of a new subsample of grgs were conducted on the southern sector of the ratan-600 in the first ten days of january 2010 .",
    "the observations were made using continuum radiometers of the first feed for wavelengths of 1.38 , 2.7 , 3.9 , 6.25 , 13 , and 31 cm .",
    "as in @xcite , owing to the poor interference conditions during the observations , data suitable for the analysis were obtained in only four bands : 2.7 , 3.9 , 6.25 , and 13 cm . at the observed elevations , the beamwidths in the central cross section were 25 `` , 36 '' , 57 `` , and 119 '' , respectively . at 6.25 and 13 cm , we used subchannels of the spectrum analyzer that enabled us to effectively suppress interference . the observed",
    "sources are listed in table 1 , and a log of the observations is in table 2 . note that grg2103 + 64 was observed nine times in this set of observations ; however , we could not achieve a signal - to - noise ratio suffcient to detect this source .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ , > , > \" , ]",
    "we have observed five grgs for the first time and measured their flux densities using the ratan-600 radiometer complex .",
    "we have calculated the spectral indices of the grgs as the slopes of the tangents to the approximating curve for the integrated spectrum at a given frequency .",
    "table 3 lists the flux densities measured at 2.7 , 3.9 , 6.25 , and 13 cm , and table 4 the spectral indices , equal to the coeffcients of the argument x. the ratan-600 data for grg0751 + 4231 lie above the gb6 and nvss data .",
    "the object from the gb6 catalog is virtually pointlike ; this explains the low level of its catalog flux .",
    "it is most likely that the level of the nvss flux density has the same origin , since integrating over the peak values results in the incomplete detection of weak diffuse emission .",
    "the radio source observed on ratan-600 in the area of grg0929 + 4146 consists of two radio galaxies : grg0929 + 4146 proper , as a multi - component object extended along a line , and a fr ii double radio source with coordinates @xmath0 = 09h29m24s , @xmath1 = + 41@xmath24618 \" that merges into a single extended object at the left , near grg0929 + 4146 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the ratan-600 does not resolve these radio galaxies in a meridian transit ; thus , figure 2 presents the total spectrum . using the nvss , wenss , and 7c data , we have plotted separate spectra for each of the radio galaxies ( fig .",
    "the integrated radio spectrum for grg0929 + 4146 alone is approximated as y = 3.046 - 1.208x , and the spectrum of the neighboring radio galaxy is y = 1.818 - 0.774x , with a smaller slope , demonstrating that the ratan-600 observations at short wavelengths are dominated by the radio emission from j092924 + 414618 .",
    "we resolved grg1521 + 5105 into two components , whose spectra are presented in fig .",
    "the integrated flux densities for one component ( j152103 + 510600 ) were 368 mjy at 13 cm and 167 mjy at 6.25 cm , whereas they were 181 mjy at 13 cm and 150 mjy at 6.25 cm for the other component ( j152125 + 510401 ) .",
    "the functions fitting the radio spectra of the components are y = 2.226 - 0.800x and y = 1.537 - 0.645x , respectively .",
    "grg1521 + 5105 , which is identified with the galaxy sdss j152114.55 + 510500.9 and has the photometric redshift z = 0.37 ( ned data ) , is projected against the outskirts of the cluster nscs j152018 + 505306 , with redshift z = 0.52 ( ned ) , at an angular distance of 15 from its center . however , there are more than 1700 galaxies ( ned data ) and a great number of radio sources within 10 of the radio galaxy ( fig .",
    "4 ) . due to the lack of redshifts for the overwhelming majority of these , it is di cult to judge whether there could be a physical association of grg1521 + 5105 with any group of galaxies .",
    "however , the rich environment of this radio galaxy stimulates additional interest in searching for the origin of its giant size .",
    "in addition , as in our previous work @xcite , we have estimated the contribution of the observed grgs to the microwave background .",
    "we used the ratan-600 data and the updated grg spectra to calculate the integrated flux densities at millimeter wavelengths , listed in table 5 .",
    "the contribution of the studied giant radio sources on scales of galaxy clusters exceeds 1 mjy , and could be an important confusion factor in distinguishing components of the microwave background .",
    "we envisage further accumulation of new data , including compiling lists of new grgs and observations on the ratan-600 .",
