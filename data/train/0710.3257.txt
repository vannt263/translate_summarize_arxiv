    "understanding the transport of inertial particles with finite density , such as sediments , neutrally buoyant particles or bubbles in turbulent flows of water is of practical interest for both industrial engineering or environmental problems . in a turbulent flow ,",
    "the mismatch in density between the particles and the fluid causes light particles to be trapped in high vortical regions while heavy particles are ejected form vortex cores and concentrate in high strain regions  @xcite .",
    "as particles with different buoyancy tend to concentrate in different regions of the flow , they are expected to exhibit different dynamical behaviors . in recent years",
    ", significant progress has been made in the limit of infinitely heavy , pointwise particles  @xcite , and numerical simulations have received experimental support  @xcite . in case of infinitely light particles ( _ bubbles _ ) : the result of the numerical simulations on particle distributions and on fluid velocity spectra @xcite agree in various aspects with experimental findings @xcite although direct comparison between experiments and numerical simulations for the acceleration pdf and correlation of the particles as not been investigated in the past .    indeed , in spite of the growing resolution of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equations at high reynolds numbers , it remains a challenge to resolve the motion of realistic inertial particles : some degree of modelization is necessary .",
    "the equation of motion of finite - size , finite - density particles moving in a turbulent flow is not precisely known , and a comparison with experimental data can help refining the models and extending their range of validity .",
    "several experimental techniques have been developed for measuring the velocity of particles along their trajectories .",
    "the optical tracking method developed in the cornell group has revealed that fluid particles experience extremely intense accelerations  @xcite , while individual particles have been tracked for time durations of the order of the flow integral time scale using an acoustic technique  @xcite .",
    "because of the very fast decrease of the acoustic scattering cross - section with the scatterer s size , this method is limited to particles with diameter of the order of the wavelength , _",
    "i.e. _ inertial range sizes  @xcite .",
    "the principle of the acoustic technique is completely analogous to laser doppler velocimetry ( ldv ) , provided that expanded light beams are used ( an arrangement we call e - ldv hereafter ) .",
    "the advantage of e - ldv , compared to acoustics , is that the much smaller wavelength of light allows a better resolution in space and also the use of smaller tracer particles .",
    "the principle of the measurement technique is reported in  @xcite , where its performance has been compared and validated against the silicon - strip tracking  @xcite of neutrally buoyant lagrangian tracers .",
    "we focus here on the dynamics of inertial particles _",
    "i.e. _ particles whose density differ from that of the fluid . here",
    "we report the first comparison between experimental measurements of acceleration of particles having a relative density in the range @xmath0 ( air bubbles ) to @xmath1 ( pmma ) in the same highly turbulent flow , and numerical results obtained by tracking pointwise particles with finite density in a direct numerical simulation of isotropic homogeneous turbulence @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are performed by means of standard pseudo - spectral methods , where particular care has been used in keeping a good resolution at the dissipative scales .",
    "the numerical code for integrating the evolution of the eulerian field and the lagrangian tracing of particles is the same as described in @xcite .",
    "a thorough validation of the numerical approach , included the lagrangian evolution of the tracers has recently been performed against experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "the numerical integration of tracers has , with respect to experiments , the clear advantage of a uniform , well controlled geometry and very large statistics ; on the opposite , the resolution can be limited to small reynolds numbers . for what concerns the treatment of realistic particles , i.e. particles with a density mismatch and a `` finite '' size ,",
    "the best modelization to use is not clear and one of the main goal of this manuscript is indeed to compare state - of - the - art lagrangian data against numerical results from a current modelization .",
    "the laser doppler technique is based on the same principle as the ultrasound doppler method which has good tracking performance of individual lagrangian tracers  @xcite . in order to access dissipative scales , and",
    "in particular for acceleration measurements , one adapts the technique from ultrasound to laser light : the gain is of a factor 1000 in wavelength so that one expects to detect micron - sized particles . for a lagrangian measurement",
    ", one has to be able to follow the particle motion to get information about its dynamics in time . for this ,",
    "wide laser beams are needed to illuminate the particle on a significant fraction of its path .",
    "the optical setup is an extension of the well known laser doppler velocimetry technique ; fig .",
    "[ exp - setup ] .",
    "a laser beam is split into two beams ; each is then expanded by a telescope so that their diameter is about 5 mm .",
    "then the two beams intersect in the flow where they create an array of interference fringes .",
    "as a particle crosses the fringes , the scattered light is modulated at a frequency directly proportional to the component of the velocity perpendicular to the fringes .",
    "it yields a measurement of one component of the particle velocity . in practice",
    ", we use a cw yag laser of wave length 532 nm with 1.2 w maximum output power . in order to get the sign of the velocity we use acousto - optic modulators ( aom ) to shift the frequency of the beams so that the fringes are actually travelling at a constant speed .",
    "the angle of the two beams is tuned to impose a 60 microns interfringe so that the frequency shift between the beams ( 100  khz ) corresponds to 6  m / s .",
    "as the beams are not focused , the interfringe remains constant across the measurement volume whose size is about @xmath2 .",
    "it is imaged on a photomultiplier whose output is recorded using a national instrument pxi - ni5621 digitizer at rate @xmath3  mhz .",
    "the flow is of the von krmn kind as in several previous experiments using acoustics  @xcite or optical techniques  @xcite .",
    "water fills a cylindrical container of internal diameter 15  cm , length  20 cm .",
    "it is driven by two disks of diameter 10 cm , fitted with blades in order to increase steering .",
    "the rotation rate is fixed at values up to 10  hz .",
    "for the measurements reported here , the taylor based reynolds number reaches up to 850 at a maximum dissipation rate @xmath4 equal to 25 w / kg . we study three types of particles : neutrally buoyant polystyrene particles with size 31 microns and density 1.06 , pmma particles with size 43 microns and density 1.4 and air bubbles with a size of about 150 microns .",
    "the mean size of the bubbles , measured optically by imaging the measurement volume on a ccd , is imposed by the balance between the interfacial surface tension @xmath5 and the turbulent fluctuations of pressure .",
    "this fragmentation process is known to lead to a well defined and stationary size distribution @xcite with a typical diameter @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the density of the fluid .",
    "the signal processing step is crucial as both time and frequency  ( _ i.e. _ velocity )",
    " resolutions rely on its performance .",
    "frequency demodulation is achieved using the same algorithm as in the acoustic doppler technique .",
    "it is a approximated maximum likelihood method coupled with a kalman filter  @xcite : a parametric estimator assumes that the signal is made of a modulated complex exponential and gaussian noise .",
    "the amplitude of the recorded signal and the modulation frequencies are assumed to be slowly evolving compared to the duration of the time window used to estimate the instantaneous frequency . here",
    "the time window is about 30  @xmath8s long and sets the time resolution of the algorithm .",
    "outputs of the algorithm are the instantaneous frequency , the amplitude of the modulation and a confidence estimate which is used to eliminate unreliable detections .",
    "afterwards , the acceleration of the particle is computed by differentiation of the velocity output .",
    "note that measurements are performed only when a particle moves within the ( limited ) measurement volume so that after processing , the data consists in a collection of sequences with variable lengths .",
    "for all the measurements , the acceleration variance is computed using the same procedure as in  @xcite : it is obtained for several width of the smoothing kernel used in the differentiation of the velocity signal and then interpolated to zero filter width .    for small neutrally buoyant particles , _",
    "i.e. _ lagrangian tracers , our data is in excellent agreement with the high speed imaging measurements performed by the cornell group  @xcite .",
    "when the rms value of the acceleration is normalized by the heisenberg - yaglom scaling : @xmath9 ( @xmath4 beeing the energy dissipation rate per unit mass and @xmath10  m@xmath11s@xmath12 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ) , both experiments yields the same values for the non dimensional constant @xmath13 ( @xmath14 at @xmath15 for the e - ldv compared to @xmath16 for the cornell data at @xmath17 ) .",

    "we first compute the velocity root mean square value @xmath40 for the three cases : the values are @xmath41 at @xmath15 for the tracers , heavy ( pmma spheres ) , and light particles ( bubbles ) .",
    "within error bars , the large scale dynamics seems to be unaffected by changes in the particle inertia . the acceleration distribution and autocorrelation in the three cases",
    "are shown respectively in fig .",
    "[ fig - pdf ] ( top ) and fig .",
    "[ fig - cor ] ( top ) .",
    "the acceleration pdfs are quite similar for moderate acceleration values ( below about @xmath42 ) , as also observed in low reynolds number numerical simulations  @xcite . however , the probability of very large accelerations seems to be reduced in the case of inertial particles as compared to lagrangian tracers .",
    "the normalized acceleration variance @xmath13 varies very significantly : it is reduced to @xmath28 for heavier particles while it is increased to @xmath43 for bubbles .",
    "the correlation functions also show significant changes with inertia : the characteristic time of decay is longer for heavy particles and shorter for bubbles compared to tracers .",
    "we measure @xmath44 respectively for tracers , heavy , and light particles , with the correlation time defined as the half - width at mid amplitude of the correlation function .",
    "we thus observe important changes in the dynamics , even if the distribution of acceleration weakly changes with inertia",
    ".    note that in our setup the kolmogorov length is about @xmath45 m at @xmath46 , so that the bubble size is about @xmath47 and therefore may not be considered as a point particle .",
    "thus , one may wonder if the bubble dynamics is not altered by spatial filtering as recently demonstrated for particles with diameters in the inertia range  @xcite . to check ,",
    "we have compared the dynamics of large neutrally buoyant particles with diameter @xmath48 m to the one of lagrangian tracers .",
    "the results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - pdf ] together with the other particles : the effect of the particle size on the pdf is found to be weak as the curve nicely superimposes with the ones for inertial particles .",
    "however , the size effect is clear when comparing either the coefficient @xmath13 ( reduced to @xmath49 ) , or the autocorrelation functions .",
    "one observes that the correlation time of the large particles is twice the one for the tracers .",
    "we conclude that the bubbles size may have a leading effect on the acceleration variance , and that the value of @xmath13 reported here probably underestimates the one that would be measured for smaller bubbles ( with diameters closer to the kolmogorov scale ) .",
    "we compare the experimental data with the results from a direct numerical simulation @xcite where a passive suspension of pointwise particles with finite density are tracked in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow .",
    "the dynamics of the particles is computed in the most simplified form of the equation of motion , _",
    "i.e. _ assuming that the particles are spherical , non - deformable and smaller than the kolmogorov length scale of the flow  @xcite .",
    "when one retains only the stokes drag force and the added mass effect , the equation of motion then reads : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the particle velocity , @xmath52 the velocity of the fluid at the location of the particle described by the navier - stokes equation , while @xmath53 accounts for the added mass effect and and @xmath54 is the stokes response time for a particle of radius @xmath18 . when made dimensionless by the kolmogorov dissipative scales ( @xmath55 ) eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) reads @xmath56 with the particle acceleration @xmath57 now expressed in the heisenberg - yaglom units .",
    "thus , at a given reynolds number , the particles dynamics only depends on the values of the two dimensionless parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 this is generally different from the case of infinite inertia of the particles ( @xmath60 ) , which has been formerly addressed in several numerical and theoretical studies @xcite , and for which instead only the stokes number @xmath61 matters .",
    "it is also different from the pure bubble case ( @xmath62 ) for which the particle indeed has no inertia but only added mass @xcite .",
    "we performed numerical simulation at @xmath63 ( grid resolution @xmath64 ) , in which many particles , characterized by different pairs @xmath65 ( specifically 64 different sets of @xmath66 particles ) were numerically integrated by means of eqn .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) .",
    "particles do not have feedback on the flow field .    in order to compare the numerical results with the experimental data , three types of particles ( tracers , heavy , and bubbles ) with different inertia and stokes number have been studied .",
    "the values for both @xmath58 and @xmath61 have been chosen close to the ones of the particles used for the e - ldv ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the normalized acceleration variance shows the same trend in experiments and numerics : @xmath13 is reduced from the tracer value @xmath67 to @xmath68 for heavier particles and increased to @xmath69 for bubbles ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this seems to be a robust trend in the dns . to emphasize this , in figure [ a_rms_dns ] we show the behavior of @xmath70 , i.e. the root - mean - square value of the particle acceleration normalized by the heisenberg - yaglom scaling , in a wide range of the @xmath65 parameter space from a less turbulent dns ( @xmath71 ) which has a very large number of @xmath65 pairs .",
    "results from the @xmath72 , not showed here , are qualitatively similar .",
    "note again that no significant reynolds number dependence of the probability distribution was found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the acceleration distribution behavior and its comparison with the experiment is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig - pdf ] . in the numerics",
    "we observe that the probability of very large accelerations is reduced for the heavier particles as compared with tracers , while it is increased for the bubbles .",
    "this feature , seems not to be present in the experimental results .",
    "furthermore , we notice that for the three types of particles , the acceleration pdfs , rescaled by the _",
    "rms _ acceleration , is close to the experiments .",
    "experimental ones have always longer tails , reflecting the more intermittent nature of the turbulent flow , which has a larger reynolds number ( @xmath73 vs. @xmath74 ) .",
    "we also observe a qualitative agreement for the changes in the acceleration autocorrelation functions when changing inertia , figure [ fig - cor ] .",
    "one measures @xmath75 respectively for tracers , heavy and light particles .",
    "just as observed for the experiments , the dynamics is faster for the bubbles while heavier particles decorrelate slower than fluid tracers .",
    "the @xmath76 difference is more pronounced here than in the pdf s ( see ref.@xcite ) and prevent from a more detailed comparison .",
    "while solving a simplified version for the equation of motion , the numerics reproduces qualitatively the effect of the particles inertia on their dynamics .",
    "in particular , the dependence of the acceleration autocorrelation on the particle inertia is nicely reproduced , see figure [ fig - cor ] .",
    "however , also some discrepancies become visible , though not yet completely conclusive , as a better resolution and statistics of both the experiments and the numerics would be important for firmer conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , in this section we shall have a closer look at the differences and propose some explanations .",
    "first of all , there is only qualitative agreement on the ratio @xmath77 . it is larger for the experiment than for the numerics .",
    "moreover , the tails of the numerical pdf of the bubble acceleration seem to be enhanced as compared to those for tracer acceleration .",
    "vice versa , the tails of the numerical pdf of the particle acceleration seem to be reduced as compared to those for tracer acceleration .    what is the origin of the difference between the experiments and the numerics ? first of all the taylor - reynolds numbers are different , but ref .",
    "@xcite suggests an at most weak dependence of the acceleration pdfs on the reynolds number ; a finding that is supported by a comparison of our numerical simulations at @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "next , in the numerical simulations we disregarded the lift and the gravitational force . while this presumably has little effect on heavy particles and tracer , it does modify the dynamics of the bubbles . in refs .",
    "@xcite we had shown by comparison of numerical simulations for point bubbles with and without lift , that without lift the bubble accumulation inside the vortices is more pronounced , i.e. , bubbles without lift are more exposed to the small scale fluctuations , which clearly will contribute to the pronounced tails of the numerically found acceleration pdf , see figure [ fig - cor ] , bottom .    next , also the two - way coupling of the particles ( i.e. , the back - reaction of the particles on the flow due to their buoyancy difference ) has been neglected in the simulations of this paper . as e.g.  shown in refs .",
    "@xcite for bubbles and in ref.@xcite for particles , it has an effect on the turbulent energy spectrum and thus also on the acceleration statistics .",
    "however , as in the present experiments the particle and bubble concentrations are very low , the two - way coupling effect on the spectra should be hardly detectable .",
    "the final difference between numerics and experiments we will discuss here  and presumably the most relevant one  is the finite size of the particles in the experiments as compared to the numerics which is based on effective forces on a point particle .",
    "although the heavy particles are not large as compared to @xmath80 , this clearly holds for the bubbles and the @xmath81 diameter neutral particles . indeed , figure [ fig - cor ] shows how the finite size of these particles smears out the acceleration autocorrelation , as compared to the tracer case . also the ratio @xmath82 for large neutral particles",
    "is only @xmath26 , which demonstrates that the size of large particles has a large effect on their acceleration variance .",
    "this type of spatial filtering , which also lowers the pdf of large neutral particles in the experiment , is not related to a temporal filtering of the particle based on its response time .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig.[fig - pdf](middle ) where one can see that two neutral particles ( @xmath83 ) with different response times ( different @xmath61 or @xmath84 ) have the same acceleration pdf , with same @xmath13 , and same autocorrelation function .",
    "thus this size effect , which is not taken into account in the point - particle based numerical simulations , presumably is responsible for both the relatively small value of @xmath85 measured for bubbles , and the change in the shape of the pdf .    to conclude ,",
    "we have reported acceleration measurements of inertial particles using extended laser doppler velocimetry and have compared the experimental data to dns simulations of the motion of pointwise particles with finite density .",
    "we have observed a qualitative agreement between experiments and numerics in the shape of the pdf and of the autocorrelation function .",
    "we have given arguments for the small discrepancies .",
    "an experimental study of the motion of bubbles with smaller sizes is needed for a better comparison with the numerical simulations . also numerical simulations keeping into account the finite size of particles",
    "would presumably improve the agreement between experiments and numerical data and detailed comparisions as the one presented in this paper help to reveal the limitations of point - particle models . obviously , going beyond point - particles is extremely challenging in numerical simulations . a first step in this direction",
    "has e.g.  been taken by prosperetti and coworkers with their _ physalis _ method @xcite which presently is extended towards turbulent flows @xcite .    * acknowledgement * rv , gv , nm and jfp are indebted to artem petrosian for his help in setting - up up the optics of the experiment , and to mickael bourgoin for many fruitful discussions",
