    "the present work is a natural continuation of our prior article @xcite , where we introduced a new method ( termed the helicoidal method ) for proving various multiple vector - valued inequalities in harmonic analysis .",
    "this technique , initially developed for the bilinear hilbert transform @xmath1 , reduces to hlder s inequality and some very precise local estimates for the operator in question .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath11 be an @xmath12-linear operator so that @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( whenever @xmath11 satisfies such estimates , we say @xmath17 ) .",

    "that is , for every @xmath23 and every @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we want to prove @xmath37    using restricted weak - type interpolation , we were able in @xcite to treat also the case @xmath38 , when @xmath39 ( the last inequality is to be read component - wise ) .",

    "localized _ versions of the @xmath49-depth vector - valued operator @xmath50 . aiming to prove for fixed sets @xmath51",
    ", we need to exercise great care in evaluating @xmath52 there is another localization associated to the spatial dyadic interval @xmath53 , hence the notation @xmath54 .",
    "this will be made precise later , but such a localization is natural in the time - frequency analysis setting , where operators are decomposed into wave packets that retain both spatial and frequential information .",
    "the estimates needed for @xmath55 correspond to lebesgue exponents between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as a result of the assumption @xmath58 .",
    "so one could estimate the multilinear form as in , but as a matter of fact , a sharper result can be obtained by using the fact that the functions @xmath59 are supported inside the sets @xmath60 : @xmath61    some information on @xmath62 is preserved in the operatorial norm @xmath63 , which is necessary in the induction step . obtaining the desired vector - valued inequalities",
    "amounts to transforming @xmath64 estimates into @xmath65 estimates , and this resembles an extrapolation principle . if @xmath66 , hlder s inequality and localizations play an important role , but in the case @xmath67 , the sharp evaluation of @xmath63 is essential .",
    "the method of the proof is described in greater detail in section [ sec : def - layout ] , after introducing some necessary definitions .",
    "however , if some @xmath68 ( recall that @xmath69 corresponds to the target space in ) , we can not expect to have an inequality comparable to for the multilinear form .",
    "the difficulty consists , for example , in associating a trilinear form to an operator @xmath70 when @xmath71 .",
    "the linearization of such an operator is achieved in the quasi - banach case by dualizing the @xmath40 quasinorm through the lebesgue space @xmath6 ( see section [ sec : quasi - banach ] ) .",
    "we improve the helicoidal method from @xcite by substituting with @xmath72 again , optimal estimates are needed for the operatorial norm @xmath73 , which are in some sense finer than those for the operatorial norm @xmath74 of the multilinear form .",
    "all things considered , we are able to prove that whenever @xmath75 , we have also @xmath76 . here",
    "we write @xmath77 for the vector - valued operator of depth @xmath18 associated to the tuple of vectors @xmath78 .",
    "recursively , whenever @xmath79 , we are able to give a characterization of @xmath80 , where , for all @xmath23 , @xmath81",
    ".    we will illustrate how the helicoidal method produces quasi - banach valued inequalities for two bilinear operators : the paraproduct @xmath0 and the bilinear hilbert transform @xmath1 .",
    "then the techniques extend to allow for certain multiple banach or quasi - banach valued inequalities",
    "( for us , that corresponds to multiple @xmath5 spaces with @xmath82 ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath83 i.e. for paraproducts , vector - valued extensions exist for all the lebesgue exponents in the range of the scalar operator .",
    "this is the case for linear caldern - zygmund operators as well .",
    "for @xmath1 the situation is more complicated due to its singularity ; we can prove nevertheless that whenever @xmath84 , it contains the local @xmath85 range : @xmath86 for any @xmath87 and any tuple of vectors @xmath88 satisfying for all @xmath24 @xmath89    our main motivation was finding the full range of mixed norm estimates for the operator @xmath2 , i.e. the biparameter paraproduct .",
    "such estimates imply leibniz rules in mixed - norm @xmath5 spaces and they can prove useful in the study of nonlinear dispersive pde ( particular cases of these inequalities were used in @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", we proved that @xmath90 whenever @xmath91 , with @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "a similar result was proved using different techniques in @xcite .",
    "both approaches invoke vector - valued inequalities in the study of multi - parameter multilinear operators .",
    "these operators are intriguing because they do nt always behave as expected .",
    "for example , in @xcite and @xcite it was shown that @xmath2 is bounded , but @xmath95 does nt satisfy any @xmath5 estimates of hlder type .",
    "the range of boundedness for @xmath96 was only recently understood in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the question left open from @xcite and @xcite concerns an inequality similar to when @xmath97 , corresponding to a quasi - banach vector space . following the methods from @xcite , such an estimate",
    "is implied by the multiple vector - valued estimate @xmath98 here we extend the helicoidal method to the context of banach or quasi - banach spaces , which will allow us to prove estimates as above .",
    "hence , combined with our previous results from @xcite , we have    [ thm : kenig - two - param ] let @xmath99 and @xmath100 , be so that @xmath101 for any index @xmath102 .",
    "then the bi - parameter paraproduct @xmath2 satisfies the following mixed norm estimates : @xmath103    the leibniz rule implied by this theorem , as will be shown in section [ sec : mixed_norm - est ] , can be formulated in the following way :    [ thm : leibniz ] for any @xmath104 @xmath105 whenever @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and the indices satisfy the natural hlder - type conditions .    that @xmath109 should be greater than both @xmath110 and @xmath111 is sensible ,",
    "since this is also the natural condition in the case when @xmath112 , as proved in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath113 we only have one constraint : @xmath107 .",

    "this is the case in , which in turn is necessary for theorem [ thm : kenig - two - param ] .",
    "in fact , in the bi - parameter analysis , the estimate corresponds to the boundedness of the square function and of the maximal function in the one - parameter study of paraproducts .",
    "otherwise , multiple vector - valued inequalities for multilinear caldern - zygmund operators can be obtained as in @xcite or @xcite by extrapolation , from weighted estimates .",
