    "<S> general theory of relativity ( or lovelock extensions ) is a dynamical theory ; given an initial configuration on a space - like hypersurface , it makes a definite prediction of the final configuration . </S>",
    "<S> recent developments suggest that gravity may be described in terms of macroscopic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it finds a concrete manifestation in the fluid - gravity correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> most of the efforts till date has been to relate equilibrium configurations in gravity with fluid variables . in order for the emergent paradigm to be truly successful </S>",
    "<S> , it has to provide a statistical mechanical derivation of how a given initial static configuration evolves into another . in this essay </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the energy transport equation governed by the fluctuations of the horizon - fluid is similar to raychaudhuri equation and , hence gravity is truly emergent .    </S>",

    "<S> physically , simple interactions occur at smaller length scales ( microscopic level ) , and collective behaviour manifests at much larger length scales . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the coloumb force @xmath0 experienced by two charges separated by a distance(@xmath1 ) is understood to be a fundamental force while the interaction force @xmath2 between two moving bubbles in a superfluid is understood as an _ </S>",
    "<S> emergent law_. in the same spirit , one is tempted to ask whether the general theory of relativity is the low - energy limit of a strongly correlated system and gravitons their collective excitations @xcite .    due to the long range and attractive nature of gravity , </S>",
    "<S> gravitational systems are far - from - equilibrium . over the last three decades </S>",
    "<S> , it has been noticed that the condensed matter systems that are far - from - equilibrium exhibit a convenient separation of length and time scales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the key physical ingredient is that the dynamics of a system with many degrees of freedom can be described by the interaction of only a few ( such as those at long length and time scales).this so - called _ hydrodynamic _ approach provides a successful basis for describing systems far from equilibrium  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamics of black - holes @xcite , seem to suggest the _ hydrodynamic _ approach . due to hawking radiation , the black - holes are out - of - equilibrium systems @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> the black - hole entropy is dominated by the degrees of freedom close to horizon  @xcite . over the last few years </S>",
    "<S> , a growing body of evidence suggests that gravitational dynamics near the black - hole horizon , is analogous to the dynamics of fluids  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( see also refs . @xcite . )    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the present authors have taken an alternative route and shown that the fluid - gravity correspondence is more physical and can be used to derive physical quantities from the horizon - fluid@xcite . identifying the long wavelength limit </S>",
    "<S> as that used in the mean field theory description of phase transitions , we showed that the entropy of the ordered phase is same as the bekenstein - hawking entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the flow chart below provides a birds eye view of the fluid - gravity programme and the right side describes the programme undertaken by the authors .    </S>",
    "<S> mean field theory may yield correct critical exponents for certain phase transitions , however , it ignores fluctuations that drive system from one physical state to another . in the same spirit , while we were able to recover bekenstein - hawking entropy by modelling the horizon - fluid using mean field theory , our previous analysis is incomplete , or for that matter , any emergent gravity approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the question that needs to be addressed in any emergent gravity approach is whether the fluctuations of the horizon - fluid provide necessary information about how a given horizon - fluid configuration evolves into another . in this essay </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the transport equation for the order parameter of the horizon - fluid system is identical to the raychaudhuri equation .        </S>",
    "<S> we start by assuming that the horizon - fluid forms a condensate at a critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the justification comes from two lines of arguments . </S>",
    "<S> first , the evidence provided by carlip@xcite that the black - hole horizon has some properties that exhibit universality . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the physics near the horizon is that of a system near a critical point . </S>",
    "<S> second , recently , skakala and shankaranarayanan@xcite modelled the fluid as a bose gas with @xmath3 particles and found that all the particles stayed in the ground state for large horizon radius . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that horizon - fluid forms a bec at some critical temperature @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions underlying this are @xcite :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> there is a temperature @xmath4 ( critical temperature ) , at which , all the @xmath3 fluid degrees of freedom on the horizon form a condensate . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the system remains close to the critical point .    </S>",
    "<S> one can describe this critical system , a homogeneous fluid , using mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter is @xmath5 and the thermodynamic potential @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant , coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 are determined by the relation @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> one can determine the entropy of the fluid in @xmath12 phase and show that it corresponds to the bekenstein - hawking entropy , @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the horizon - fluid is near a critical point and when the system goes over to the ordered phase , its entropy is the same as the black - hole entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the formalism can be extended to include black - holes in ads background@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the negative cosmological constant can be treated as an external field analogous to an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this causes first order phase transition and the existence of a tri - critical point .    </S>",
    "<S> what has been described so far , concerns only static variables in the gravity theory(in this case , the parameters which fully describe a black - hole ) , correspond to the equation of state of the horizon - fluid . </S>",
    "<S> our aim now is to investigate , within the emergent paradigm , how a given static configuration with a given equation of state is driven to another static configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we do this in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider fluctuations from the equilibrium that are adiabatic ; fluctuations whose wavelengths are of the same order as the horizon - fluid and occur over a longer time scale . </S>",
    "<S> second , we consider fluctuations that are non - adiabatic ; wavelength of these fluctuations are usually smaller than the fluid scale .    _ adiabatic process _ : fluctuations take the fluid from one equilibrium configuration to another . </S>",
    "<S> since these fluctuations are adiabatic , the new equilibrium configuration can also be described by mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium position is one of the two minimas of the double well potential on which the system has settled , i.e. @xmath14 . let , @xmath15(@xmath16 ) denote the change in the value of the order parameter(number ) due to fluctuations , then the change in the potential is @xmath17 the change in entropy during this process can be determined in two ways , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> + comparing them , we get , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the statement of the first law of thermodynamics for the fluid system . </S>",
    "<S> it is of the same form as the mathematical statement of the process 1st law for event horizons , @xmath21 which relates the increase in the mass of a black - hole due to matter - energy falling through the horizon to the increase in the horizon area  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it shows us that the physical process 1st law can be thought of as the adiabatic restoration of equilibrium after a fluctuation in the fluid system .    _ </S>",
    "<S> non - adiabatic process : _ in this general case , the fluid system is away from equilibrium and some amount of energy is being transferred to it from the external source . </S>",
    "<S> due to the fluctuations , energy is gained by the horizon - fluid , correspondingly , the number of fluid d.o.f and order parameter @xmath22 change . applying onsager s hypothesis@xcite , and assuming @xmath8 does not change in eq .  , we can describe the change in the order parameter @xmath22 by the langevin equation . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the horizon fluid has negative bulk viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> since the fluid is taken to be homogeneous , only the bulk viscosity needs be considered .    </S>",
    "<S> the change in the order parameter @xmath22 is given by the brownian motion(see , for instance , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) : @xmath23 where , @xmath24 is the random term and @xmath25 is the damping term due to the bulk viscosity of the fluid . using , we get , @xmath26 where , @xmath27 . @xmath12 here , as it fluctuates around @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> taking the ensemble average on both sides of eq . and using @xmath29 , we get , @xmath30 where , @xmath31 is the mean squared fluctuation in @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> + to determine @xmath33 , we note , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where , @xmath36 denotes the time average of a quantity . using virial theorem@xcite , we have , @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations in @xmath22 are related to the dissipated energy density of the fluid @xmath38 implying that @xmath39 and @xmath33 are related to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we get , @xmath40 the damping coefficient @xmath41 has dimensions of length - inverse . for the horizon - fluid </S>",
    "<S> , this corresponds to the horizon radius , which is inversely proportional to @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to : @xmath43 where , @xmath44 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> this is the key result of this essay regarding which we would like to stress the following points :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the above equation is similar to the raychaudhuri equation sans the shear term , @xmath45 to relate to the gravity side , we shift to the geometric variable , @xmath46 , which is the cross - sectional area of the null congruence in addition to being the area of the @xmath47 dimensional fluid </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath48 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 denotes the affine parameter along the null congruence as used in @xcite . comparing with , </S>",
    "<S> one can write , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> it is to be noted that except for the values of the coefficients , the signatures are the same . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk viscosity is negative for the fluid on the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> hence , what is normally the damping term in a standard brownian motion , here reinforces the transport of energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to assume that the coefficient of such a term is proportional to the bulk viscosity , @xmath52 ( stokes law is one example of this ) , i.e. @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the dissipated energy density is of the form , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> so there is an extra term apart from the amount of the matter - energy that falls across the horizon . in the gravity picture , </S>",
    "<S> the dissipated energy then consists of two parts , one matter - part and one geometry - part . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our analysis provides an alternative view of the raychaudhuri equation i. e. governing the transport of energy on the fluid side .    </S>",
    "<S> general theory of relativity is a dynamical theory and makes a clear and precise prediction about how an initial configuration would evolve to a final configuration . </S>",
    "<S> raychaudhuri equation is a crucial ingredient in describing the dynamics of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> it governs the dynamics of null geodesic congruences . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent gravity paradigm has been with us for close to fifty years . </S>",
    "<S> most of the efforts within the emergent gravity approach has been directed towards relating the equilibrium configurations in gravity with the fluid variables . in this essay , we have shown that the differential equation governing the transport of energy into the fluid is similar to the raychaudhuri equation . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly demonstrates that the horizon - fluid description provides dynamical information about gravity and gravity is truly emergent </S>",
    "<S> . one might compare this with the long wavelength or the hydrodynamic limit of ads - cft , where the dynamics of the fluctuations on the fluid side can be mapped to the macroscopic variables on the gravity side@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a programme , however , has not been carried out for the gravity theory for a more general class of space - time . </S>",
    "<S> the results reported here constitute a first step towards that direction . </S>"
