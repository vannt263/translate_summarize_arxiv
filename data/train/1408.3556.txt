    "solar energy is one of the most abundant energy source which can be utilized by living organisms . in plants and bacteria , the mechanism that converts this solar electromagnetic energy into chemical energy",
    "is called photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied model systems is the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) protein - pigment complex in green sulfur bacteria @xcite , which funnels the excitonic energy absorbed from the outer antenna system ( chlorosome / baseplate ) to the reaction center .",
    "excitonic energy transfer ( eet ) in such photosynthetic protein - pigment complexes has been studied by various nonlinear optical spectroscopy methods such as pump - probe , hole burning , and photon - echo have been applied @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies using",
    "2d electronic photon - echo spectroscopy reported beating patterns with oscillation periods that approximately correspond to the difference of the eigenenergies .",
    "this phenomenon has been found in several photosynthetic protein - pigment complexes at both cryogenic temperatures @xcite and room temperature @xcite , which implies that quantum coherence may be a crucial component to the reported high - efficiency energy transfer @xcite .",
    "the fmo complex has a homotrimer structure and in recent crystallographic studies it was found that the presence of an additional ( eighth ) bacteriochlorophyll _ a _ ( bchl _ a _ ) per subunit , which sit in in the cleft at the protein surface close to the baseplate @xcite .",

    "et al_. calculated the site energies of bchls in the fmo complex based on a new crystal structure from the green sulfur bacteria , _",
    "prosthecochloris aestuarii _ @xcite . in their calculation",
    "it was found that bchl 8 has the highest site energy , and after modelling the baseplate and the reaction center ( rc ) by two low dielectric constant layers ( @xmath1 ) they also found that bchl 8 was red - shifted and the overlap with the baseplate fluorescence was increased .",
    "furthermore , due to the greater vicinity of bchl 8 to the baseplate , bchl 8 being closer than any other bchl of the fmo , it has also been proposed that bchl 8 functions as a linker between the baseplate and the fmo complex .",
    "experimental findings of quantum coherence within the photosynthetic protein - pigment complexes also instigated great interest in the use of theoretical models to describe photosynthetic eet .",
    "theoretical description is particularly challenging in some specific systems such as the fmo complex and the b850 ring of the light harvesting complex ii ( lh2 ) found in purple bacteria ; these difficulties are due to the fact that the magnitude of the electronic coupling and the exciton - phonon coupling are of same order and therefore neither of them can be treated perturbatively . to tackle this problem ,",
    "a methodology referred to as hierarchical equation of motion ( heom ) has been developed by tanimura and co - workers @xcite ; a high temperature approximation ( hta ) of heom has also been developed by ishizaki and co - workers to describe the eet dynamics in a model dimer @xcite .",
    "the heom has already been implemented in calculating the excitonic transfer dynamics of photosynthetic protein - pigment complexes @xcite and more recently it is also used within simulations of the linear and 2d electronic spectra of the above mentioned systems @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to understand the role of the bchl 8 in the eet pathway of the fmo complex . to achieve this ,",
    "we first analyse the difference of excitonic wave function overlap among bchls between the _ apo _ ( 7-sites ) and _ holo _ ( 8-sites ) forms and propose the corresponding eet pathways .",
    "then the heom is applied to simulate the 2d photon - echo spectra of both forms by using a model hamiltonian formed in a previous study ( pdbid : 3eoj ) @xcite .",
    "meanwhile we have also explored the effect of both temperature and of the the presence of static disorder to the eet .",

    "<S> the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) protein - pigment complex acts as a molecular wire between the outer antenna system and the reaction center ( rc ) ; it is an important model system to study the excitonic energy transfer . </S>",
    "<S> recent crystallographic studies report the existence of an additional ( eighth ) bacteriochlorophyll a ( bchl a ) . to understand the functionality of this eighth bchl , we simulated the two - dimensional electronic spectra of both the 7-site ( _ apo _ form ) and the 8-site ( _ holo _ form ) variant of the fmo complex from green sulfur bacteria , </S>",
    "<S> _ prosthecochloris aestuarii_. by comparing the difference between the spectrum , it was found that the eighth bchl can affect two different excitonic energy transfer pathways , these being : ( 1 ) directly involve in the first pathway 6 @xmath0 3 @xmath0 1 of the _ apo _ form model by passing the excitonic energy to exciton 6 ; and ( 2 ) increase the excitonic wave function overlap between excitons 4 and 5 in the second pathway ( 7 @xmath0 4,5 @xmath0 2 @xmath0 1 ) and thus increase the possible downward sampling routes across the bchls . </S>"
