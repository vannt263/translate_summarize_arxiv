    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) are the most energetic explosions of astrophysical objects known to human being ( see reviews of piran 2004 ; meszaros 2006 ; woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "grb cosmology has been part of the hierarchical structure formation paradigm of the @xmath3cdm model ( xu & fang 1999 ; bromm & loeb 2007 ; nagamine , zhang & hernquist 2008 ; pontzen et al .",
    "2009 ) . with the recent discovery of z=8.3 grb 090423 ( tanvir et al .",
    "2009 , salvaterra et al .",
    "2009 ) , grb s ly@xmath0 damping wings are becoming a powerful tool to probe chemical evolution , star formation , the reionization era and the dark ages ( kawai et al . 2006 ; totani et al . 2006 ; gallerani et al . 2008 ; mesinger & furlanetto 2008 ; mcquinn et al .",
    "2008 ) .    however , the damping wings are not a clean probe",
    ". there are at least two kinds of damping wings .",
    "the first one is caused by the scattering away of photons by igm s neutral hydrogen atoms along line of sight(miralda - escude 1998 ) , the optical depth of which follows an integration over the voigt wings of the scattering cross section function and thus can be approximated as inversely proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the second kind of damping wing is caused by scattering from a local dla cloud ( totani 2006 ) , which maps directly the voigt profile and is roughly proportional to @xmath5 . besides the uncertain profile of the absorptions , ly@xmath0 emissions have been observed to be present in the centers of damped lyman @xmath0 absorption spectra of qso - pdlas ( roximate amped yman @xmath0 bsorption systems , e.g. hunstead , pettini , & fletcher 1990 ; leibundgut & robertson 1999 ; moller et al .",
    "2002 ; hennawi et al .",
    "2009 ) , as well as in those of grb - hdlas ( ost dla ) ( e.g. vreeswijk et al . 2004 ; totani et al . 2006 ) .",
    "these ly@xmath0 photons may have a number of origins .",
    "they can be produced by recombination in star formation regions , by recombination in agn powered ionization , by fluorescence of gas cloud illuminated by a nearby qso , by gravitational heating in cooling streams , or by resonant scattering of the continuum afterglow of grbs as investigated in this paper .",
    "the escape of lyman @xmath0 photons through an optical thick cloud has been studied by many authors ( osterbrock 1962 ; adams 1972 ; urbaniak & wolfe 1981 ; loeb & rybicki 1999 ; zheng & miralda - escude 2002 ; tasitsiomi 2006 ; verhamme et al . 2006 ; laursen & sommer - larsen 2007 ; dijkstra & loeb 2008 ; pierleoni et al , 2009 ; roy et al .",

    "resonantly scattered photons of grb s continuum optical light are not lost .",
    "they are retained in neutral hydrogen clouds and will arrive observers at a later time .",
    "these scattered and thus delayed photons may look brighter than the transmitted ones because grb s optical light decays fast .",
    "thus resonant scattering is a new mechanism which produces weak ly@xmath0 emission features in grb s spectrum .    in  2 ,",
    "the modeling and the physics of resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons are reviewed . in  3 , we use a simplified but analytic model to illustrate how emission features can be formed when continuum photons at lyman @xmath0 wavelength collide resonantly with circumburst neutral hydrogen clouds . in  4 , we model the complete scattering process with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the effects of model parameters and the observability are discussed and concluded in  5 .",
    "resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons in a cosmic setting has been studied by many authors employing either monte carlo simulations ( e.g. loeb & rybicki 1999 ; zheng & miralda - escude 2002 ; tasitsiomi 2006 ; verhamme et al .",

    "a lyman @xmath0 photon at frequency @xmath23 will experience a free path length @xmath24 before it scatters resonantly with a neutral hydrogen ( hi ) atom .",

    "to study the details of resonant scattering of a lyman @xmath0 photon with a hi atom , we follow field ( 1959 ) s scattering geometry and notations .",

    "besides , hi atom has gained a velocity increment of @xmath49 when absorbing the incoming photon .         in adopting model parameters for grb s afterglow",
    ", we consider a low redshift grb with optical flash , but without any host galaxy dla so that the scattering effects at grb s immediate neighborhood can be isolated from other effects along line - of - sight .",
    "we employ spherically symmetric representations of small cloudlets around grb .",
    "two models of the neutral hydrogen distribution are considered . in the sphere model ,",
    "a uniform host cloud surrounds the grb .",
    "( we also extend our equations to be applicable to a polytrope whose density is a function of radius . ) in the shell model , a shell - like distribution of gas intercepts photons .",
    "hydrogen is uniformly distributed on the shell in the shell model . in fig .",
    "1 we illustrate the scattering geometry of the shell model .",
    "a thin shell of @xmath30 is at 5pc away from grb with a shell thickness of 0.065pc and hi number density @xmath50 .",
    "this same figure also illustrates our sphere model , taking the shell position as the outer surface of the cloud .",
    "shell or cloud sizes from 0.01pc to 1 kpc have been studied . although grb afterglows are consistent with a scenario in which every afterglow is beamed , we tried to avoid the added complexity of beam angle by treating the radiation isotropically .",
    "because of the finite speed of light following _ special relativity _ , the afterglow photons actually do nt feel the existence of a beam boundary at small times before jet break happens .",
    "we further assume that the neutral gas is at rest in hydrodynamical equilibrium following maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "a column density of @xmath51 is used , which is at the lower end of the observed grb - dlas .",
    "1b shows the time delay distribution for the scattered - once photons .",
    "this time delay is purely geometric and not affected by how neutral hydrogen is distributed , or by its total amount , thus applies to both models .",
    "at the site of grb , we model the photon source function @xmath52 as an initial plateau with a single power law function cut off .",
    "@xmath53 if @xmath54 , and @xmath55 if @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath0 is observed to be between 0.5 and 3 in real grbs .",
    "we adopt @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath58 ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath59 sec is the burst duration at the source .",
    "a flat featureless spectrum of grb is assumed across the line profile . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the initial continuum flux is unitary ( = 1 ) for the unit system we use .",
    "in a static medium , the radiative transfer equation for a pencil of photons is ( chandrasekhar 1950 , chapter 1 , eq.(49 ) ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the specific number density of photons , @xmath62 is the specific intensity ( chandrasekhar 1950 , chapter , eq.(1 ) ) and @xmath63 is the source function .    in the traditional way of discussing damping wings the source term",
    "is ignored , @xmath64 the observed flux directly from grb is @xmath65 .",
    "thus the number flux in the grb s redshift frame is @xmath66 in which @xmath67 represents summation over all the pencils of photons arriving in unit area at the observer .",
    "thus , @xmath68 is the flux of the source if it were not decaying ( thus it is the maximum ) .",
    "@xmath69 is the photon release rate at the source in unit of photons per @xmath23 per second , we conveniently choose @xmath70 to illustrate .",
    "it is in unit of photons per x per second .",
    "@xmath52 is the source function introduced in  2 .",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath23 refer to values at the source .",
    "the number flux @xmath72 is related to the conventional definition by @xmath73 erg cm @xmath74 .",
    "eq(5 ) is inaccurate because the scattered photons may be scattered back into the line of sight .",
    "the scattered back photons can be described by the source term @xmath63 .",
    "the accurate flux can always be written as @xmath75 . from eq(4 ) we have @xmath76 we use @xmath77 to name the contribution from the scattering of photons directly from the photon source .",
    "similarly , @xmath78 denotes the contribution to the photon flux from the resonant scattering of photons which have been scattered @xmath79 times ( @xmath80 ) . in a medium where there is no explicit photon source ,",
    "the only contribution to the source function @xmath63 is from resonant scattering .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 . on the other hand ,",
    "the intensity of photon flux of scattered component can always be formally expanded as @xmath82 if we define @xmath83 as the flux of photons which are scattered exactly n times , @xmath84 specifically , @xmath85    so the traditional damping wing is the zeroth order approximation along a perturbative approach in which photons of any times of scattering will be included . in this section ,",
    "we go one step further to include photons which have scattered for only once , and ignore photons contributed from multiple scatterings .",
    "the advantage is the ability to include the scattering geometry analytically and to show how the basic scatter feature is generated and scaled . in next section",
    ", we will show by monte carlo simulation method that the scattered emission is indeed dominated by photons which are scattered once , when the observation time is small .    for photons which are scattered once",
    ", we can ignore the tiny transfer in frequency which is of order @xmath86 .",
    "thus under assumption of elastic scatterings , the scattered photons have the same frequency as what they come with . for the shell model under thin shell approximation ( @xmath87 ) from eq(9 ) , the number flux of the scattered - once light is @xmath88 in unit of @xmath89 where @xmath67 represents summation over all the pencils of scattered once photons which arrive at the observer within unit area .",
    "this equation is accurate under these assumptions but have larger errors if the jet boundary @xmath90 when the photons scattered from the farther half of the shell have to cross the front shell to reach the observer.@xmath91 is the optical depth of the shell along the actual light path ( fig .",
    "1a ) . for spherically symmetric medium , @xmath92 .",
    "since the directly arriving photons and the scattered photons follow different light paths , it s possible that @xmath91 may be different from @xmath93 .    for the sphere model of hi distribution ,",
    "the scattered - once component is @xmath94 @xmath43 where the radial density distribution is a polytrope @xmath95 .",
    "since the cross section of lyman @xmath0 resonant scattering is a sharp peak at the core and very extended on the wing , most scattered once photons are scattered on the far wing @xmath96 from the continuum of grb s afterglow where @xmath97 . eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) are good estimates when the time is small and the observed multiple scatterings are rare",
    ". however , eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) underestimate the intensity of photons near the emission peaks where optical depth is large .",
    "thus the scattered component in figs .",
    "2 and 3 are lower bounds .",
    "monte carlo simulations in  3 are able to find the true spectral profile and intensity .",
    "nevertheless , eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) are accurate at small times and give order of magnitude accuracy at later times .",
    "they are adequate to illustrate the formation of the ly@xmath0 emission feature .",

    "n=1 \" next to it ) .",
    "the fast decaying straight lines are for the transmitted component while the slow varing curves are for scattered component .",
    "since the transmitted light decays fast , ly@xmath0 emission feature will be formed at times where scattered light is brighter than the transmitted one .",
    ", height=6 ]     components at @xmath98 for different cloud sizes in the shell model of circum - grb neutral hydrogen .",
    "since the transmitted light decays fast , ly@xmath0 emission feature will be formed in the region where scattered light is higher than the transmitted one .",
    ", height=245 ]    in fig .",
    "2 , our simple analytic model gives a good idea on the formation of lyman @xmath0 emission and shows the light curves for a range of cloud sizes for the shell model . the light curve of the scattered component is flat for a long time , in sharp contrast with the rapid decaying of the transmitted light .",
    "this is because contributions from new areas are joining into the scattered component for the first time ( fig .",
    "the time scale for the variance of the scattered component is the time scale of light crossing of the cloud .",
    "when the cloud boundary is reached , we see a sudden drop of light by several orders of magnitude . after that , the scattered component becomes smaller than the transmitted component again .    for our shell model",
    "the luminosity of the scattered component is only about @xmath100 of the maximum of the transmitted continuum .",
    "when the cloud size is in the range of 0.01 pc to 1kpc , the range of the scattered component is between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "adopting a different cloud column density does affect spectral shape but has little effects on the flux amplitude .",
    "this is because the peaks always correspond to @xmath101 .",
    "the increased number of scattered photons is counteracted by more damping along their path of propagation to the observer .",
    "grb progenitors are massive stars usually sitting in the middle of a density enhancement .",
    "if we assume a power law radial density profile of n=1 instead of n=0 , our predicted brightness of the scattered component will increase by 3 orders of magnitude at an observation time of one day ( figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this is because the intensity of scattered flux is sensitive to hi presence in grb s immediate neighborhood , as a result of the time - delay pattern in fig .",
    "1b . a denser homogeneous cloud with @xmath102 and radius @xmath103 0.01",
    "pc can produce similar effects to a polytrope cloud of @xmath104 and radius @xmath103 5 pc at times smaller than @xmath105 sec .",
    "2 )    it should be pointed out that the flatness of the light curve of the delayed arrival of scattered of @xmath97 photons , together with the rapid decaying of the source , make the lyman @xmath0 emission potentially identifiable .",
    "should the source decays not fast enough ( @xmath99 ) , the chance of telling the scattered emission from the transmitted one is very slim .",
    "also , if the cloud is too large ( @xmath106 kpc ) , the scattered emission may be too weak to be observed .",
    "every new photon is released at the coordinate center along radial direction .",
    "the frequency distribution of the new photon follows that of the continuum .",
    "since continuum varies very little over a small frequency interval , we adopt a constant spectrum across the lyman @xmath0 profile .",
    "once the photon enters the gas medium , the length of free path is determined by a distribution function @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean length of free path .",
    "the location of the scattering is then determined . if it is outside the hi cloud , the photon is labeled escaped .    at the new location of the scattering ,",
    "the velocity @xmath107 of the hi atom is generated by two steps .",
    "first , the velocity components @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 is the propagation direction of photon ) are generated following a maxwell distribution @xmath111 .",
    "second , the velocity @xmath112 is generated following the distribution : @xmath113 which is the joint requirement of gaussian distribution and lorentz profile for the rest frame cross section of resonant scattering .",
    "the distribution shown in equation ( 12 ) is not a true distribution of velocities . from eq.(3 ) , @xmath114 when recoil is negligible .",
    "the velocity distribution in a scattering thus represents photon frequency shifts with respect to the line center in velocity units .",
    "the direction of the resonantly scattered photon is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "other distributions such as dipole distribution ( zm02 ) would cause small differences . when a complete treatment with polarization considered , the difference is limited to a factor of @xmath115 ( rybicki & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to isotropically scattered photons .",
    "once the direction is generated , frequency of outgoing photon can be calculated by eq.(12 ) . with this new set of frequency and direction of photon",
    ", we repeat the above procedures of calculating the free path and determining on the escape . each photon is followed all the way along its path until it escapes .",
    "since the effectiveness of generating @xmath112 determines crucially the speed of calculation , special algorithms have been proposed ( zheng & miralda - escude 2002 , zm02 hereafter ) .",
    "the distribution function of @xmath112 is a direct multiplication of two well known functions , namely gaussian and lorentz .",
    "they either have a sharp cut - off or a sharp peak . since their probability peaks happen at different places ,",
    "the total distribution function has two peaks .",
    "because of this , any single step generation algorithm using rejection method will inevitably leave the peak of one function falling on the tail of the other function , thus inefficient . on the other hand",
    ", three or more step process will not improve the algorithm because the efficiency downgrades with more steps when computation overheads increase . as a result ,",
    "zm02 s two steps algorithm works best .",
    "we also found that two step process may be an overkill when the two peaks are close to each other ( for small @xmath23 at core scattering ) .",
    "we make an improvement on the algorithm and list it in the appendix .",
    "50 million of photons are experimented for each model .",
    "the observed flux of scattered photons is a composite result of photons released at a series of epochs . at each epoch , the photon release is like a delta function . in this section",
    "we study the photons released from a single moment .",
    "the source is strictly a @xmath116 function in time .",
    "we also assume that the source is at @xmath117 .",
    "for such a photon source , the transmitted continuum flux exists only at the first moment ( eq.(9 ) ) .",
    "after that , resonantly scattered photons start to arrive at the observer and become the source of the observed photons at times not equal to zero .",
    "we will show that the escaping time scale of these photons become the new time scale of these scattered emission .",
    "follow eq.(10 ) and integrate the @xmath116 function over time for the source , the scattered - once light for the shell model is @xmath118 for @xmath119 and is zero after that . for small t , it can be approximated as @xmath120 .",
    "similarly , for the sphere model @xmath121     sec for shell model of hi distribution , and the second graph is for the sphere model at @xmath122 . the analytic model is a good approximation for @xmath123 sec in both panels .",

    "but at @xmath129 for the sphere model ( @xmath126 for the shell model ) , the simple analytic model begins significantly underestimating the emission flux .",

    "lyman @xmath0 resonant scattering \" for photons which are released exactly at lyman @xmath0 frequency .",
    "as found earlier by osterbrock ( 1962 ) and adams ( 1972 ) , most of the collisions in the second problem is the  core scattering \" . in these problems",
    ", the photon escaping is determinated by rare events , either by a single flight or a single excursion depending on the value of optical depth .",
    "the escape typically takes @xmath175 time to escape ( adams 1972 ) . in the case of grb s",
    "afterglow , these  core scattered \" photons do exist , but they originate from a narrow section of continuum spectrum ( @xmath153 ) , and they take a longer time to escape .",
    "so their intensity will be much harder to to detect . in our problem , photons are  wing scattered \" .",
    "photon source is the whole section of continuum ( @xmath176 ) up to the frequency where optical depth is of order one .",
    "the escape time scale is the light crossing time scale of the cloud .",
    "time delay of a scattered and escaped photon is mainly determined by the geometry of the photon s trajectory ( fig.1 ) , rather than the diffusion in frequency space .",
    "the size of the cloud affects more on the predicted luminosity than the hydrogen content in it does .",
    "certainly the cloud has to be rich in hi so that its wing scattering can become effective .    for the same reason ,",
    "the escaped photons which are scattered only a few times , or less than one hundred times constitute mostly the escaped luminosity at times when the scattered - once photons finish their role(e.g . figs.7 and 11a ) . the profile difference of mc simulation from analytic model ( e.g. figs .",
    "4b , 6 and 10 ) , which was affected by photons experiencing multiple scatterings , is actually caused by photons experiencing only up to a few hundred times .",
    "photons with millions of times of collision have very little effect on the flux in fig . 7 and fig.11a .",
    "\\(ii ) intensity of lyman @xmath0 emission    separate from the analytic model and the mc simulations , we can estimate the flux of scattered photons in a simple way : @xmath177 .",
    "the total amount of photons @xmath178 released are the flux of continuum light times the frequency width which corresponds to @xmath97 , say @xmath179 , multiplied by the effective life time of the source , say 10 seconds .",
    "these photons are then spreaded over the crossing time of the cloud to escape , say @xmath136 sec ( @xmath180pc ) .",
    "this leaves us with an intensity of scattered light of about @xmath181 of that of the maximum continuum of the observed optical afterglow .",
    "\\(iii ) effects of @xmath182    the column density of neutral hydrogen will affect the total optical depth of the cloud , thus determines the width of the damping troughs by eq.(6 ) .",
    "since the emission photons originate from the continuum , a larger optical depth will cut a larger chunk of the continuum to become the source of the scattered photons .",
    "the amount of photons ( or the equivalent width of the emission ) is then approximately proportional to @xmath183 , or @xmath184 .",
    "but the height of the peaks is little affected because the width of the emission peak scales with @xmath183 .",
    "\\(iv ) effects of motion    the gas around grb may be in motion , as a result of light pressure , gravity , or by turbulence .",
    "a typical speed of such motions is that of the sound speed .",
    "we considered a simplest model of motion in which all the neutral gas move at a same speed of @xmath14 inward along radius .",
    "the bulk speed affects resonant scattering in three ways .",
    "first , the neutral hydrogen restframe frequency changed thus the effective optical depth for a given incoming photon has changed .",
    "second , an outcoming photon gets a frequency decrement when they exit in the radial direction by doppler effect .",
    "third , the differential speed field of the medium causes an asymmetry of the twin peaks .",
    "this effect by velocity gradient is somehow similar to that caused by recoil . from eq.(3 ) for each collision , the ratio of frequency change due to velocity gradient to that by recoil is of order @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the velocity difference across the cloud .",
    "the velocity gradient may become more important than recoil to affect the profile s symmetry if @xmath187 .",
    "12 shows the effects of motion on the emission profile in the shell model for a single flashing photon source . in an inward bulk motion",
    ", the emission center is redshifted by an amount @xmath188 .",
    "the effects on the profile is to make blue peak higher and wider for an inward falling .",
    "similar effects will happen for the red peak for an outward flow .",
    "our findings are in agreement with earlier researches .",
    "urbaniak & wolfe ( 1981 ) first considered the effects of relative velocity between the ly@xmath0 source and the gas .",
    "they found that the blue peak is suppressed if the two slabs are recessing from each other ; dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find similar effects that collapsing gas enhances the blue peak in the escaped flux .",
    "\\(v ) effects of cloud size and hi distribution    the cloud size , or more exactly the light crossing time , determines the characteristic time scale .",
    "our results for the 5 pc cloud can be scalable into other sizes because the radiative transfer equation is linear with time . for a given cloud size , the result will be different for different distribution of hi .",
    "the result of a polytrope distribution is somehow equivalent to changing a uniform cloud into a different size .",
    "( fig.2 )    so far , the existence of clumps of neutral material ( n @xmath189 @xmath190 ) associated with hii regions has been confirmed by co molecular lines ( williams et al .",
    "1995 ) , and by si ii fine structure lines ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "2004 ) . clumps with density up to @xmath191 @xmath190 are found in environments like rosette nebula ( tsvilev et al .",
    ". however , these do not exclude clumps with higher density , which could be detected by future molecular line observations .",
    "so , the luminosity of the scattered component can be anywhere from @xmath1 to @xmath2 of the maximum of the transmitted optical flash .",
    "\\(vi ) best time to observe    if not obscured by host galaxy s dla or intergalactic neutral hydrogen , the time window of observability is from several hours to several years when photons scattered once or twice dominates .",
    "the exact time depends highly on the neutral density of the grb s immediate environment ( figs 2&3 ; figs 7&11 ) .",
    "the intensity prediction can be boosted by several orders of magnitude if the grb resides in high density filaments or cloudlets .",
    "\\(vii ) distinguishing from other ly@xmath0 sources    lyman @xmath0 emission feature formed by our mechanism has characteristics on its time variance .",
    "the frequency offset of peaks shrinks .",
    "so does the width of the peak .",
    "the amplitude may vary . in the sphere model ,",
    "everything changes monotonically . in the shell model",
    ", the intensity of the peaks may have a second brightening when the photons from the far side of grb arrive .",
    "the typical time scale for spectral variance is that of the light crossing time of a hydrogen clump , typically one parsec or smaller , unlike qso - dla or galaxy grb - dla which involves kilo - parsec length scale .",
    "therefore , the scattered grb emission can be separated from those of the host galaxy by this time variability , as well as by their spatial compactness . if observed , the resonant peaks time dependent behavior acts like a scanning directly on the distribution of neutral hydrogen in grb s immediate neighborhood because photons which arrive at different times correspond to scatterings at different off - sight line distances ( fig.1b ) .",
    "this work is supported by the ministry of science and technology of china , under grant no .",
    "by introducing an auxiliary parameter @xmath192 and calculating an additional variable @xmath193 , zm02 algorithm reduces the waste of the exponential suppress at large @xmath112 on the wing scatterings for the rejection method , but introduces computational overhead for core scattering when x is small . besides , for extremely large x , their algorithm is still inadequate to overcome the rejection waste intrinsic in the method .",
    "thus we improve the algorithm by treating the speed generation differently at different x.    \\(1 ) for small @xmath23 ( we adopt as @xmath194 ) , since the peaks of @xmath195 and @xmath196 are very close to each other , the percentage waste of rejection is very small .",
    "methods of plain rejection ( not employing zm02 s algorithm ) is faster because it does nt have the overheads .",
