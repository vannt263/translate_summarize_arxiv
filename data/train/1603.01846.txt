    "<S> in contrast , the mfpt for a single particle to escape a circular domain is @xmath136 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> since t cell receptor triggering occurs within seconds @xcite , the above calculation predicts that receptor - ligand binding must involve a mechanism faster than passive diffusion . </S>",
