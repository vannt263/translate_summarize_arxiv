    "the connection between long - duration ( @xmath10 s ) gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and hydrogen - stripped , core - collapse supernovae ( i.e.  type ib / c sne ) is now well - established in the nearby universe ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . at @xmath11 , where the overwhelming majority of grbs are detected ( e.g.  @xcite ) ,",
    "type ib / c sne are too faint , absorbed , and redshifted to be observed routinely with current facilities .",
    "observations of the _ environments _ of distant grbs , however , are consistent with a massive star origin .",
    "grb hosts are typically faint , blue , irregular galaxies with large specific star - formation rates ( star formation rate per unit stellar mass ; @xcite ) . and within their hosts , grb afterglows are found to be concentrated in the innermost regions , tracing the blue light from hot young stars even more strongly than type ib / c sne @xcite .",
    "bright grb afterglows are therefore ideally suited to probe the dense gas in the very regions where stars are being formed .",
    "this stands in marked contrast to quasar ( qso ) sight lines , which sample galaxies according to gas cross - section and are therefore much more likely to probe the outer regions of galaxy halos ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "while the sample of afterglow absorption spectra suitable for elemental abundance studies is still quite small compared with qsos , a general picture has nonetheless begun to take hold .",
    "grb systems are characterized by : 1 ) large metal equivalent widths and correspondingly large metal column densities ( e.g.  @xcite ) , 2 ) extremely high neutral hydrogen column densities ( e.g.  @xcite ) , typically falling at log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath13 ( the so - called damped lyman-@xmath14 systems , or dlas ; @xcite ) , and 3 ) sub - solar metallicities , typically @xmath15 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "all three findings are consistent with a massive star origin for long - duration grbs .    here",
    "we present observations of a long - duration event , grb070125 , that does not fit neatly into this paradigm . despite deep spectroscopy of a bright ( @xmath16 mag ) afterglow , we detect only weak absorption at @xmath17 , a firm upper limit on the column density of the host galaxy .",
    "coupled with the large offset between the afterglow and the nearest detected host galaxy candidate , our observations indicate the large - scale ( i.e.  ism ) burst environment is dramatically different from all previously observed grb hosts .",
    "grb070125 was discovered by the inter - planetary network at 07:20:45 ut on 2007 january 25 @xcite . the burst was notable both for its brightness ( fluence @xmath18erg@xmath19 ; @xcite ) and its long duration ( @xmath20s ; @xcite ) .",
    "the well - characterized prompt emission allowed measurements of the peak energy of the spectrum ( @xmath21kev ; @xcite ) , as well as a `` pseudo - redshift '' @xcite of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we began observing the field of grb070125 with the automated palomar 60-inch telescope @xcite at 02:18:59 ut on 2007 january 26 ( @xmath23 hours ) .",
    "inside the burst error circle , we found a bright , stationary source ( @xmath24 ) not present in the sloan digital sky survey images of this field @xcite that we identified as the optical afterglow of grb070125 ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ fig : finder ] ) .",
    "our subsequent broadband monitoring of the afterglow of grb070125 is presented in a separate work ( chandra et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "we also undertook spectroscopic observations of grb070125 with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) mounted on the 8-m gemini north telescope beginning on the night of 2007 january 26 .",
    "for all spectra , we employed a @xmath25 binning to increase the ccd signal - to - noise ratio , and we used the r400 grating and 1  slit .",
    "our configuration resulted in a spectral resolution of @xmath26  and a dispersion of @xmath27pix@xmath28 .",
    "the details of our observations are shown in table [ tab : spec ] .",
    "all spectra were reduced in the iraf environment using standard routines .",
    "pairs of dithered spectra were subtracted to remove residual sky lines .",
    "cosmic rays were removed using the la cosmic routine @xcite .",
    "spectra were extracted optimally @xcite and wavelength calibration was performed first relative to cuar lamps and then tweaked based on night sky lines in each individual image . in all cases , the resulting rms wavelength uncertainty was @xmath29 .",
    "both air - to - vacuum and heliocentric corrections were then applied to all spectra .",
    "extracted spectra were divided through by a smoothed flux standard to remove narrow band ( @xmath30 ) instrumental effects @xcite .",
    "finally , telluric atmospheric absorption features were removed using the continuum from spectrophotometric standards @xcite .",
    "deep , late - time imaging to search for the host galaxy of grb070125 was taken with the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris : @xcite ) mounted on the 10-m keck i telescope .",
    "lris employs a dichroic , allowing simultaneous imaging in both @xmath31- and @xmath32-band filters .",
    "we obtained 4 @xmath33 300 s images at a mean epoch of 7:12:06.6 ut on 2007 february 16 .",
    "individual images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using standard iraf routines .",
    "co - addition was performed using swarp .",

    "in figure [ fig : spec ] we show a sum of all four gmos spectra obtained on the night of 2007 january 26 ( 1a-1d ; see table [ tab : spec ] ) , normalized by the continuum .",
    "the strongest absorption feature present is a doublet at @xmath2 7124,7142 , with observed equivalent widths of @xmath34  ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36  ( @xmath37 ) . despite the weakness of the feature",
    ", the doublet is detected in separate co - additions of spectra from the two different instrumental configurations ( @xmath38vs .",
    "@xmath39 ) , providing strong confirmation of its reality ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spec ] , right inset ) .",
    "inspection of the two - dimensional spectra reveals the only other significant absorption feature , at @xmath40 , is offset slightly from the center of the trace .",
    "furthermore , it is only detected in one instrumental configuration .",
    "we therefore believe this feature is most likely an artifact of the data reduction process .",
    "we find marginal ( @xmath41 ) evidence for strengthening of both features in the doublet over the duration of our observations .",
    "variability has been reported before in grb afterglow spectra , both within the grb host itself ( time - dependent excitation caused by uv photons from the grb afterglow ; @xcite ) and in intervening absorbers ( caused by variability in the grb beam size relative to intervening clouds ; @xcite ) . however , because of the uncertainty of this result , we proceed using average values measured from the sum of all our spectra obtained on the night of 2007 january 26 .    based on the lack of lyman-@xmath14 absorption",
    ", we place an upper limit on the afterglow redshift of @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite report a contemporaneous lris spectrum of the afterglow with coverage extending down to the atmospheric cut - off at @xmath43 . based on the absence of",
    "damped lyman-@xmath14 absorption or lyman-@xmath14 forest emission , they report a redshift upper limit of @xmath44 . given the weakness of the observed doublet , the expected weakness of the associated lyman-@xmath14 absorption ( see below ) , and the decrease in sensitivity at the bluest lris wavelengths , we believe this limit is too strict .",
    "instead , we adopt a more conservative value of @xmath45 ( corresponding to @xmath46 ) throughout this work .",
    "consistent with the above redshift constraint , we identify the observed doublet as @xmath2 2796 , 2803  at @xmath5 . besides the observed wavelength ratio",
    ", we offer two additional pieces of evidence in support of this association .",
    "first , the observed equivalent width ratio ( @xmath47 2796 / @xmath47 2803 ) is consistent with the value of 2:1 predicted for weak , unsaturated absorption from this transition .",
    "second , the @xmath2 2796 , 2803  doublet is the strongest absorption feature observed in _ all _ grb hosts identified in the redshift range @xmath0 ( see below ) .",
    "even if the system does not arise from the grb host , this doublet is commonly found in intervening systems of both qsos @xcite and grbs @xcite . at this redshift",
    ", we place an upper limit on the rest - frame equivalent width of absorption from @xmath47 2852  of @xmath48  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] , left inset ) .",
    "based on the observed equivalent widths , we can calculate corresponding column densities in the optically thin ( i.e.  unsaturated ) limit : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the oscillator strength ( from @xcite ) , @xmath51 is the rest - frame equivalent width , and @xmath47 is the rest wavelength .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : lineids ] .",
    "for the observed system we measure a column density of log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath52 .",
    "the corresponding upper limit on the column density is log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath53 .    to compare our observed system with previous samples",
    ", we would like to know whether it arises from the grb host or some intervening galaxy .",
    "to this end , we undertook a second epoch of gmos spectroscopy on the night of 2007 january 29 ( 2a-2d ; see table [ tab : spec ] ) to search for nebular emission lines _ at the location of the afterglow_. while still bright enough to provide a reliable trace ( @xmath54 ) at this epoch , the decreased afterglow flux improved our sensitivity to faint emission lines . at @xmath55 ,",
    "the only common line indicative of active star formation to fall in our bandpass is [ @xmath47 3727 ]  ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the presence of several bright night sky lines nearby significantly affected our sensitivity .",
    "nonetheless , we put an upper limit on the observed fluxcdm cosmology with the latest parameters from _ wmap _",
    "( @xmath57 km s@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 ; @xmath58 ; @xmath59 ; @xcite ) . ] from [ @xmath47 3727 ]  at @xmath55 of @xmath60 erg @xmath19 s@xmath28 .",
    "using the relation from @xcite , this corresponds to an upper limit on the star - formation rate of @xmath61 m@xmath62 yr@xmath28 .",
    "this lies on the low end of star - formation rates observed in previous grb hosts @xcite .    without a secure emission - line redshift",
    ", we can not determine the nature of the system ( i.e.  host or intervening ) .",
    "nonetheless , because of our redshift constraints , @xmath63 , the @xmath2 2796 , 2803transition from the host is guaranteed to fall within our observed bandpass ( n.b .",
    "this is the case even if we apply our weaker @xmath42 constraint ) .",
    "therefore , _ even if the observed system is from an intervening galaxy , the measured equivalent widths are a firm upper limit on the presence of in the host system_. in what follows we shall assume that @xmath17 is the redshift of the grb host ; all our conclusions below are only strengthened if @xmath64 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mgii ] we plot the observed @xmath47 2796 rest - frame equivalent width for grb070125 compared to all previously observed grb hosts . on the ordinate axis we plot the ratio between the 2796   and 2803  components of the doublet .",
    "we find grb070125 is an outlier on both axes .",
    "clearly the inferred column density is significantly lower than any other grb host galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath47 2796 / @xmath47 2803 ratio in all previous grbs was @xmath65 , indicating significant saturation . for saturated lines ,",
    "the optically thin approximation ( eq .  [ eqn : optthin ] ) breaks down and can significantly underestimate the true column density .",
    "the difference in column density between the host galaxy of grb070125 and all previous grb hosts is therefore even larger than the factor of @xmath66 derived above .    to verify that the sample of grb hosts used above is not biased toward strong absorbers , we searched through the grb circulars network ( gcn ) archive to review all reported long - duration afterglow absorption spectra .",
    "neglecting the most nearby events , @xmath67 , for which the strongest absorbers still lie in the uv , we find only a single report of a high signal - to - noise spectrum absent any absorption features in the optical bandpass ( grb061021 ; @xcite ) . alternatively , of the 17 long - duration events with a reported redshift and spectral coverage of the host @xmath2 2796 , 2803  transition , but without reported equivalent widths ( i.e.  not included in figure [ fig : mgii ] ) , 16 report a detection of this doublet .",
    "the sole exception , a spectrum of grb050802 , contains several absorption features , but their identification was uncertain @xcite .",
    "we can therefore rule out a significant population of weak absorbers from grb hosts at a high degree of confidence .",
    "the detection of from grb hosts is thought to indicate that these observations probe distances far away ( @xmath68pc ) from the grb itself @xcite .",
    "the first ionization energy of mg is 7.6ev , and therefore uv photons from the grb afterglow are able to ionize any in the circum - burst medium to ( subsequent ionizations beyond are likely shielded by neutral h , as their ionization energies lie above 1ryd ) .",
    "it is therefore important to determine if we would expect to see absorption from grb070125 , or whether the feature would be too weak to detect in our spectra .    comparing the equivalent width ratio of @xmath47 2803 ( the weaker of the doublet , and therefore less saturated ) to that of @xmath47 2853 in previously observed grb hosts , we find ratios ranging from 1.7 ( grb970508 ; @xcite ) to 2.8 ( grb060418 ; @xcite ) .",
    "again we note these values are really a lower limit , as saturation will be more significant for the stronger @xmath47 2803 feature .",
    "nonetheless , we predict an @xmath47 2853 rest frame equivalent width of @xmath69 .",
    "this is below our sensitivity limit , and we therefore believe we would not be sensitive to absorption even if it were present at expected levels .    to convert our measured mg column density ( assumed to be dominated by ) to neutral hydrogen , we must estimate the ratio of mg : h in the host .",
    "previous grb hosts range in metallicity from @xmath70 \\lesssim -0.5 $ ] @xcite , much like qso - dlas @xcite . at @xmath71 ,",
    "no qso - dla has ever been observed with [ m / h ] @xmath72 @xcite , and a near - solar metallicity is difficult to reconcile with a star - forming galaxy at @xmath73 .",
    "if we neglect the cold , dense , disk depletion model , ruled out for all grb hosts observed to date @xcite , all other environments predict an mg depletion of [ mg / m ] @xmath74 @xcite . with the above limits",
    ", we estimate the neutral hydrogen column density to fall within @xmath75 log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath76 ( using solar abundances from @xcite ) .",
    "the implied mg : h ratio is in good agreement with previously observed grbs , as well as the broader sample of qsos . while @xmath12 ( ) and @xmath12 ( ) have never been accurately measured simultaneously in a single grb host , two events provide upper limits : [ / ] @xmath77 for grb000926 @xcite , and [ / ] @xmath78 for grb030226 @xcite . for qso - dlas at @xmath79 , the mean equivalent width for the @xmath47 2796 transition is @xmath80 , while for sub - dlas ( @xmath81 log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath82 ) the corresponding value is @xmath83  @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we also plot these qso- systems in figure [ fig : mgii ] . in a sample of eight weak ( @xmath84 ) absorbers",
    ", @xcite found all had log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , six of the eight systems exhibited no sign of a lyman limit break , indicating not only log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath86 , but also that neutral hydrogen was optically thin in those clouds @xcite .    an alternative way to determine",
    "the neutral hydrogen density is by modeling the afterglow spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "our models of the x - ray spectrum and optical sed do not require any dust extinction in addition to the galactic component ( chandra et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ; see also @xcite ) . however , because of the relatively large galactic column ( @xmath12(h ) @xmath87@xmath19 ; @xcite ) and the large effect of redshift on dust obscuration , these limits are not nearly as constraining as those derived from the optical spectrum .",
    "all told , we have strong evidence that the neutral hydrogen column density in the host of grb070125 is quite low : log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath88 , if not significantly smaller .",
    "such densities are usually associated with galaxy halos , and stand in contrast with the sample of previously observed grb hosts , which are commonly attributed to a disk population .",
    "the sample of previously observed grb hosts has a median log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath89 , with an observed standard deviation of 0.9 dex @xcite . in other words , to fall within one sigma of the known distribution , a grb host must be a dla .",
    "only three previous events , grbs 021004 @xcite , 050908 @xcite , and 060607 @xcite had measured log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath88 , and none report significantly lower values .",
    "all three exhibited strong absorption from other metals in addition to lyman-@xmath14 , again distinguishing them from the mostly featureless spectrum of grb070125 .    in our late - time imaging of the field of grb070125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : finder ] , right panel ) , we find no host directly underneath the afterglow location to limits of @xmath90 mag ( vega ) , @xmath91 mag ( ab ) .",
    "using a synthetic spectrum of a star - forming galaxy from @xcite , we estimate a limit on the absolute magnitude of @xmath92 mag for any underlying host .",
    "many grb host galaxies are fainter than @xmath92 @xcite , so it is entirely possible our limits are too shallow to detect the underlying emission .",
    "nonetheless , because of the low density environment , we also consider the possibility that the afterglow lies significantly further away from its host than the typical grb ( @xmath93 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "we identify three candidate host galaxies within 10  of the afterglow location : @xmath9 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : finder ] , right panel ) .",
    "@xmath9 , 3.6  to the west of the afterglow , is a large red ( @xmath96 mag ) galaxy identified by @xcite as a possible host for grb070125 . based on a gemini - gmos spectrum obtained on the night of 2007 february 4 ( 3a-3b ; see table [ tab : spec ] ) , we identify a strong continuum break at @xmath97  as the rest frame 4000   break .",
    "ca h+k and g - band absorption confirm the galaxy lies in the foreground at @xmath98 .",
    "would need to be extremely massive ( @xmath99 m@xmath62 ) for gravitational lensing to significantly affect the afterglow . ] the other two objects , @xmath94 at 3.2  distance , and @xmath95 at a distance of 5.5 , are both blue ( @xmath100 mag ) and compact , more typical of long - duration grb hosts @xcite .",
    "unfortunately neither galaxy fell on the slit in any of our spectra .",
    "finally , we speculate on the origin of grb070125 . at first glance , a compact binary progenitor system , as has been argued to explain most short - duration bursts @xcite seems appealing for grb070125 : the large host offset and low density environment could naturally be explained by the asymmetric `` kick '' imparted to such systems as the members become sne @xcite . the accretion disk formed in such a merger",
    "is expected to last only a fraction of a second @xcite ; a serious discrepancy with the observed duration .",
    "however , the recent discovery of two nearby , long - duration grbs lacking associated sn emission @xcite leads us to at least consider an origin not associated with massive stars .    in a separate work , chandra et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) study the broadband afterglow emission from grb070125 .",
    "two findings from this study cast doubt on a compact binary merger origin for this event .",
    "first , the total energy release from grb070125 , including the collimation correction , is extreme even for long bursts ( @xmath101 erg ) .",
    "short - duration bursts typically are less energetic ( @xmath102 erg ; @xcite ) , although the higher - redshift examples discussed in @xcite appear to be more luminous , and may call this into question .    more importantly , however ,",
    "based on the broadband sed ( particularly the self - absorbed radio spectrum ) , we conclude the _ local _ ( parsec scale ) circum - burst density is quite high , even for typical long - duration afterglows ( @xmath103 @xmath104 for a constant density environment ) . while this may seem inconsistent with the low column density derived from absorption spectroscopy , we instead consider the two observations the strongest evidence to date that afterglow studies and absorption spectroscopy probe _ distinct regions _ : the parsec - scale circum - burst medium for the afterglow vs.  the more distant ( @xmath68 pc ) ism for absorption spectroscopy @xcite . in the compact binary merger scenario , a large host offset should imply a low circum - burst density ( @xmath105 @xmath104 ) , as has been seen for many short - duration bursts already @xcite .",
    "because of the long duration , large local density , and large energy release , we return again to consider a massive star progenitor .",
    "instead , we now must explain how a massive star could end up so far away from the dense disk of its host . for the closest putative host from our lris imaging ,",
    "the observed offset of 3.2  corresponds to a projected distance of @xmath106 kpc at @xmath55 . to travel this distance in its short lifetime",
    ", a massive star would need an extremely large peculiar velocity : @xmath107 km s@xmath28 for a 20 myr lifetime .",
    "the fastest known object in the galaxy is the guitar pulsar , with a peculiar velocity of 1600 km s@xmath28 @xcite , while galactic stars have been identified with peculiar velocities as large as 500 km s@xmath28 ( presumably accelerated by interacting with a black hole ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is much more probable that the progenitor was formed _ in situ_.",
    "such a scenario has precedent in the local universe , where young , massive , compact star clusters have been found at large distances ( i.e.  several times the optical radius ) either in extended uv disks ( e.g.  m83 : @xcite , ngc4625 : @xcite ) or in tidal tails of interacting galaxies ( e.g.  `` antenna '' system : @xcite , `` tadpole '' galaxy : @xcite ) . in some of the most strongly interacting systems , @xmath108% of the current star formation is occurring in such clusters @xcite .",
    "broadband surveys of nearby galaxies indicate a significant fraction ( @xmath109% ) of the current star formation in the local universe takes place in these extreme environments ( d.  calzetti , private communication ) . with our current understanding of hierarchical galaxy formation",
    ", such interactions should only increase in frequency as a function of look - back time .",
    "in retrospect , it is not entirely surprising that , of the @xmath110 long - duration grbs with absorption spectra , we should discover such an event . while a thorough discussion of the relative frequency of such events is premature , the rarity of events like grb070125 implies star formation in the outer regions of galaxies in the distant universe is likely not dramatically different from what we observe today .",
