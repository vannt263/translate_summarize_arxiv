    "the study of meson - nucleus bound systems is one of the important subjects in nuclear physics .",
    "the detailed investigations of structure of bound states provide us quantitative information on hadron - nucleus interactions .",
    "so far , the structure of atomic states of pion , kaon , and @xmath8 have been successfully observed and investigated comprehensively both in theoretical and experimental points of view  @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable developments in experimental aspects is the establishment of ( d,@xmath9he ) spectroscopy for the formation of deeply bound pionic atoms with recoil free kinematics  @xcite .",
    "it opens new possibilities of the formation of other hadron - nucleus bound systems  @xcite .",
    "the bound states of the @xmath0 meson in nuclei were predicted first by haider and liu  @xcite .",
    "after that many works were devoted to studies of the structure of the bound states , the formation reactions of @xmath0-mesic nuclei and in - medium properties of the @xmath0 meson  @xcite . especially , the @xmath0 meson in nuclear medium has been recently investigated in the aspect of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus systems are purely governed by strong interactions in contrast to the atomic states of mesons with negative charge .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 mesons in the bound states are largely overlapped with nuclei . in such compact systems ,",
    "large medium effects on the mesons inside nuclei are expected , and , at the same time , wide natural widths of the bound states due to absorptions of the mesons into the nucleus are inevitable , as seen deeply bound kaonic nuclei  @xcite .    the first experimental search of the @xmath0 bound states in nuclei  @xcite was performed in @xmath10 reactions with several nuclear targets in finite momentum transfer to aim to observe narrow states as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the result turned out to be negative .",
    "some hints of the @xmath0 bound states were also observed as enhancement at the subthreshold of the @xmath0 meson production in d(p,@xmath9he)@xmath0  @xcite and @xmath11o(@xmath12,@xmath13)@xmath11ne  @xcite reactions .",
    "observation of a @xmath0 meson bound state in @xmath9he was reported in photoproduction reactions  @xcite , though interpretation of these observations are still controversial  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that coincident observation of @xmath7 pairs from @xmath14 helps to identify the formation of @xmath0 meson bound states .",
    "other experiments have been also proposed  @xcite .",
    "the study of the hadron properties in nuclear medium is largely related to the fate of chiral symmetry in finite density .",
    "it is expected that partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear medium takes place as reduction of the quark condensates  @xcite and provides effective change of the hadron properties .",
    "for the context of the study of the @xmath0 meson in nuclear medium , the @xmath14 resonance , which can be a candidate of the chiral partner of the nucleon becoming degenerate in the chiral restoration limit  @xcite , plays an important role in the @xmath0-mesic nuclei due to the strong coupling of the @xmath0-nucleon system to the @xmath14 resonance . in our previous works",
    "@xcite , it was found that the @xmath0 optical potential in nuclei is strongly sensitive to the in - medium mass gap of @xmath4 and @xmath14 and that , as a consequence , the formation spectra of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei is also sensitive to the in - medium properties of the @xmath14 .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential to the @xmath4-@xmath5 mass gap stems from possible level crossing between @xmath6-_hole _ and @xmath0 modes in nuclear medium as suggested in ref .",
    "the level difference between the @xmath5-_hole _ and @xmath0 modes without medium effects is only 50 mev , which is 10% of the @xmath4-@xmath5 mass gap and small enough in energy scale of hadronic interactions .",
    "we found that the level crossing caused by the reduction of the mass gap provides deep @xmath0 bound states and significant enhancement of the formation spectra of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei in the quasi - free @xmath0 production energies .",
    "this will be a clue to deduce the in - medium @xmath5 properties for the @xmath0-mesic nuclei .    in this paper ,",
    "we revisit the ( @xmath1 ) reaction with the recoil free kinematics for the formation of @xmath0-mesic nuclei in order to get clearer information on the level structure of the @xmath0 and @xmath5-_hole _ modes and in - medium properties of @xmath2 in the viewpoint of the chiral symmetry for baryons .",
    "we will find that the appropriate kinetic energy of the injecting pion in this reaction can be attained by the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) facility .",
    "we will also compare our calculation with the old experiments of the ( @xmath15,p ) reaction with finite momentum transfer  @xcite , in which the expected peak structures predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite were not found . in this paper",
    ", we discuss more appropriate experimental conditions than the old experiments and also propose the coincidence observation to reduce large background , which would be one of the reasons why the experiment  @xcite could not see the expected peak structure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : level_cross ] , we discuss the properties of the @xmath0 spectral functions in the nuclear matter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : potential ] , we introduce the @xmath0-nucleus optical potentials with a finite size nucleus and discuss their features . the formation spectra of @xmath0-mesic nuclei will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] , and the physical meaning of the formation spectra will be discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : feasability ] we will discuss the experimental feasibilities , and finally , we will devote sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] to summary of this paper .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the interesting feature of the @xmath0 meson in nuclear medium pointed out in ref .",
    "reduction of the mass gap between @xmath4 and @xmath5 causes level crossing of the @xmath0 and @xmath5-_hole _ modes , and consequently the @xmath0 spectral function in nuclear medium has significant properties .",
    "the in - medium @xmath0 propagator is given by , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the energy and momentum of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath19 is its mass , and @xmath20 denotes the @xmath0 self - energy in the nuclear medium . because of the strong coupling of the @xmath3 system to the @xmath2 resonance , the @xmath0 self - energy @xmath20 can be evaluated by the @xmath6 dominance .",
    "considering one @xmath5-nucleon - hole excitation , we obtain the @xmath0 self - energy in small @xmath0 momentum  @xcite as @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the coupling constant of the @xmath23-wave @xmath24 vertex and can be determined to @xmath25 to reproduce the in - vacuum partial width @xmath26 mev  @xcite at tree level . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are effective masses of @xmath4 and @xmath6 in the nuclear medium with density @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 propagator ( [ eq : g_eta ] ) with the self - energy ( [ eq : pi_eta ] ) has two poles with a positive real part in the complex energy plane in each density .",
    "these poles describe the @xmath0 meson and @xmath6-_hole _ modes in nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "corresponding to these poles , the @xmath0 spectral density @xmath30 given by @xmath31 has two peaks in a function of real energy at a certain density .",
    "we show the contour maps of the @xmath0 spectral density as functions of baryon density and @xmath0 energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , where the real parts of the pole positions are indicated by dotted lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : map](a ) shows the strength of two branches in the case that the effective masses of @xmath4 and @xmath6 do not change in medium . in this case ,",
    "two branches slightly come away from each other for higher @xmath29 as a result of level repulsion , and the strength of the lower mode is always larger than the upper mode as also shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec](a ) .",
    "the similar behavior of the @xmath0 spectral function based on the chiral unitary approach were also reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the reduction of the mass gap between @xmath4 and @xmath6 is very small .",
    "in contrast , in the case that the mass gap becomes smaller in nuclear medium , the behavior of the @xmath0 spectral density significantly changes .",
    "suppose that the mass gap of @xmath4 and @xmath6 linearly decreases by @xmath32 at @xmath33 , the level crossing between two branches takes place around @xmath34 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map](b ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the strength of the upper mode becomes stronger due to the level mixing , and the lower mode shifts downwards considerably as the density increases .    a possible source of the mass gap reduction is the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear medium . if @xmath14 is a chiral partner of nucleon , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mass difference should decrease as chiral symmetry is being restored . for the later discussion",
    ", we use the following parameterization of the mass gap reduction based on the chiral doublet model  @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the @xmath4 and @xmath6 masses in free space , respectively . here the parameter @xmath38 represents the strength of the chiral restoration at the normal nucleon saturation density @xmath33 , and its empirical value lies from @xmath39 to @xmath40  @xcite . figures [ fig : map](b ) and [ fig : spec](b ) correspond to the case with @xmath41  @xcite in the chiral doublet model .",
    "these characteristic phenomena caused by the level crossing can be a signal of the reduction of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mass gap , which supports the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry in nuclear medium . in next section ,",
    "we introduce the @xmath0-nucleus optical potentials for the study in finite size systems .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , with the sufficient reduction of the @xmath4-@xmath5 mass gap , the level crossing between the @xmath0 and @xmath5-_hole _ modes takes place at certain density in nuclear medium . as a consequence of the level crossing ,",
    "the in - medium @xmath0 self - energy has strong energy dependence .",
    "in addition , the mass gap reduction as density increases gives also strong density dependence on the @xmath0 self - energy as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this section",
    "we see that the @xmath0 optical potential in nuclei also has these features , and we briefly explain the models for the in - medium @xmath5 which we use in the calculation of the formation spectra of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "the details are described in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for the in - medium properties of @xmath6",
    ", we use two kinds of the chiral models , which are based on distinct physical pictures of @xmath6 .",
    "one is the chiral doublet model  @xcite , in which @xmath6 is regarded as the chiral partner of the nucleon .",
    "the other is the chiral unitary model , in which @xmath6 is dynamically generated resonance in the coupled channel meson - baryon scattering  @xcite .    in the first approach , the @xmath6",
    "is introduced as a particle with a large width and appears in an effective lagrangian together with the nucleon field in linear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential can be obtained from the @xmath0 self - energy  ( [ eq : pi_eta ] ) : @xmath42 here we use the local density approximation and heavy baryon limit @xcite , and the density - dependent mass difference @xmath43 are given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : massdif ] ) .",
    "we can ignore the momentum @xmath18 of the @xmath0 meson because we consider almost recoilless production of the @xmath0 meson in the following sections .",
    "we use an empirical density distribution of nucleons in woods - saxon form : @xmath44 with @xmath45 fm , @xmath46 fm and the nuclear mass number @xmath47 .",
    "the optical potential  ( [ eq : potential ] ) is sensitive to the mass difference of @xmath4 and @xmath6 in nuclei .",
    "especially , the sign of the real part of the @xmath0 optical potential changes when the mass gap of @xmath6 and @xmath4 becomes smaller than the @xmath0 energy @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "this means that the attractive @xmath0-nucleus interaction at low densities can turn to be repulsive depending on the values of the mass gap and the @xmath0 energy .",
    "this feature can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential_3d](a ) , where we plot the @xmath0-nucleus optical potentials as functions of radial coordinate @xmath48 at @xmath0 energies .",
    "for instance , at the @xmath0 threshold @xmath49 , the optical potential has a repulsive core inside the nucleus and an attractive pocket on the surface .",
    "furthermore , this mass reduction yields also the strong energy dependence of the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential as shown in fig .  [ fig : potential_3d](a ) . at @xmath50 mev , the real part of the optical potential is about @xmath51 mev attractive while that of the @xmath0 threshold @xmath49 is @xmath52 mev repulsive at @xmath53 .    in order to discuss the experimental feasibilities of mesic - nuclei formations",
    ", it is very important to estimate the imaginary parts of the optical potentials . as for the @xmath6 width in the medium which is the source of the imaginary potentials in the present model",
    ", we consider the two dominant decay channels of @xmath6 as @xmath54 and @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "the detailed evaluation is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the chiral doublet model , there are two possible models concerning the assignment of the axial charge : the naive and mirror assignments  @xcite . in this paper , we show only the results with the naive assignment of the chiral doublet model .",
    "the difference between two assignments in this study appears only in the estimation of the @xmath6 width in nuclear medium , because the representation of the mass gap @xmath56 is same in the both assignments . we have already checked the calculated spectra with the mirror assignment are almost same as that of the naive assignment  @xcite .    in the second approach to description of @xmath6 , which is the chiral unitary model",
    ", the optical potential has quite different features from the previous case . in this model",
    ", it was found that @xmath6 has a dominant component of the @xmath57 channel  @xcite . since the @xmath58 hyperon is free from the pauli blocking in the nuclear medium , only tiny change of the mass gap",
    "is expected in the nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 optical potential is attractive in the bound energy region , @xmath59 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential_3d](b ) , and has weaker energy dependence compared with that of the chiral doublet model .",
    "we evaluate the @xmath0 optical potential in the chiral unitary model using the @xmath0 self - energy obtained in ref .",
    "the binding energies and widths of the @xmath0 bound states obtained with the chiral unitary model are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in recent works",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that the @xmath2 obtained in the chiral unitary model could have some components other than the state generated dynamically by meson - baryon scattering , such as genuine quark states , and that these components could be sources of the chiral partner of the @xmath2 .",
    "the would - be quark components are implemented in the subtraction constants , which are model parameters in the chiral unitary approach . in the present model for @xmath2 in nuclear medium ,",
    "the subtraction constants were assumed to be fixed .",
    "this means that the genuine quark components are independent on medium modifications in this model",
    ". this could be the origin of the different predictions on the in - medium @xmath2 mass .",
    "in the beginning of this section , we give the formulation to calculate the formation spectra of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei by ( @xmath15,p ) reaction .",
    "we use the same formulation used in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the ( @xmath60p ) reaction was discussed for the @xmath0-mesic nuclei . to evaluate the formation cross section",

    "the total formation spectra are obtained by summing up the subcomponents , in which we take account of the separation energies to make the neutron holes by shifting the energy relatively .",

    "we also find that , due to the relatively large momentum transfer ( @xmath135 mev / c ) at @xmath92 mev , many subcomponents give finite contributions at quasi - free region , while in the @xmath91 mev case only two subcomponent @xmath136 and @xmath109 at almost all energy region shown there .      in inclusive measurements",

    "@xcite that possible backgrounds could come from quasi - free knockout , multiple pion and proton scattering , and pion absorption and that the signal - noise ratio was estimated to be 1/10 .",
    "it would be also expected in the present setup for the ( @xmath15,p ) reaction that the background can be as large as the previous experiment . to subtract such large background , it is useful to take some coincidence measurements accompanying the @xmath0 meson production in nuclei , for example simultaneous observation of @xmath137 pair coming from @xmath6 decay in a nucleus  @xcite .    in the green s function method  @xcite , one can separately calculate each contribution to the spectrum coming from the different @xmath0 absorption process . along to the formalism in ref .",

    "( [ eq : green ] ) represents the contributions from the escape of @xmath0 from daughter nuclei and the second term describes the conversion process caused by the @xmath0 absorption into the nuclei .",
    "thus , calculating only the conversion part , we can show spectra associated with decays ( or absorptions ) of @xmath0 mesons in nuclei , which can be obtained by observing emitted particles .    in the chiral doublet model , we take into account two decay channels of @xmath6 in nuclear medium as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : potential ] ; @xmath54 and @xmath142 .",
    "these contributions are expressed in the conversion part .",
    "therefore , we can separate the spectra further into two terms by describing the conversion part as @xmath143    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scon](a ) , we decompose the total spectra shown in fig .  [ fig:820](upper panel ) into three parts ; the contribution from the @xmath0-escape process , the conversion part of the @xmath54 and that of @xmath144 processes .",
    "the expected spectra with the coincidence of the @xmath137 pair from @xmath6 is indicated by the dotted line in the figure . the thin solid line in fig .  [ fig : scon](a ) includes both of the one - body and two - body absorption of @xmath6 in the chiral doublet model .",
    "it is found that the @xmath144 contribution is much smaller than that of @xmath145 .",
    "we also find that , in the doublet model case , the strength of the peak structure in the quasi - free region corresponding to the @xmath6-_hole _ mode is reduced to be about half by taking the coincidence of @xmath137 pair from @xmath6 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scon](b ) , we plot the same figure for the chiral unitary model as fig .",
    "[ fig : scon](a ) .",
    "we only show the total conversion part , since decomposition of the @xmath0 self - energy into different absorption processes was not done in the chiral unitary model .",
    "we expect that the difference between two approaches with and without the @xmath6 mass reduction is still large even we take the coincidence of the @xmath6 decay .",
    "in these estimation we do not take into account any final state interaction for emitted particles from @xmath6 decay in a nucleus .",
    "these contributions could be important for further qualitative discussions .    for the background estimation in experiments",
    ", it would be useful to observe the ( @xmath146,p ) process in the same setup as the ( @xmath15,p ) .",
    "in the ( @xmath146,p ) process @xmath0 mesons can not be created due to isospin symmetry , and it is expected that the formation spectra have no structure at the @xmath0 meson threshold .",
    "this means that all the contributions are regarded as `` background '' .",
    "the ( @xmath15,p ) reaction experiment for the formation of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei has been already performed at brookhaven in 1988  @xcite .",
    "the experiment have been done at a finite proton angle @xmath147 in the laboratory frame , based on the theoretical suggestion  @xcite to observe narrow peaks .",
    "the recoilless condition can not be satisfied for finite angle proton emissions . in the case of @xmath147 ,",
    "the momentum transfer is larger than 200 mev / c in any incident pion momentum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom_trans ] . therefore , the expected spectra will be completely different from that of the forward angle .",
    "we calculate the ( @xmath15,p ) spectra with the proton angle @xmath147 and the incident pion energy @xmath148 mev ( @xmath149 mev / c ) in the same theoretical procedure as in the previous section , in order to compare the theoretical calculations with the experimental data obtained at brookhaven .",
    "the comparison for the carbon target case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chrien ] .",
    "the data are taken from the second figure of fig .  1 in ref",
    ".  @xcite after subtraction of background estimated in the paper .",
    "they showed an experimental error bar only for one experimental point .",
    "we assume that the single error bar is a typical error for all the point and put the same error bar to all the point .",
    "we find in fig .",
    "[ fig : chrien ] that both models provide the consistent results with the experimental data .",
    "this means that the experiment with the finite proton angle in ref .",
    "@xcite is not sensitive to the in - medium properties of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "we show the details of the results calculated theoretically with finite proton angle in fig .",
    "[ fig:15deg ] .",
    "we calculate the spectra by taking into account the @xmath0 angular momenta up to @xmath150 . in the case of the finite proton angle , in contrast to the forward proton , many subcomponents have substantial contributions to the total spectra , especially higher angular momentum components @xmath151 , because the strong suppression for @xmath152 configuration is not made any more .",
    "this makes it difficult to interpret the spectrum structure in terms of the properties of the @xmath0 and @xmath5 in nuclear medium .    in the spectrum calculated with the chiral unitary model , the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:15deg ] , two prominent peaks are seen around @xmath153 mev in the subcomponents @xmath154 and @xmath155 is strongly suppressed in the recoilless kinematics . ] .",
    "these are bound state signatures of the @xmath0 meson with @xmath123 in nuclei . in particular , it is interesting that the peak of @xmath155 appears in bound region , where contamination from the quasi - free @xmath0 contributions could be expected to be small .",
    "in fact , this observation was the original idea by haider and liu for the advantage of the finite proton angle experiment . as seen in the figure",
    ", however , this bound state peak is masked by the tail of the quasi - free contribution of @xmath156 caused by virtual @xmath0 absorption in the large imaginary potential .",
    "thus , even if the chiral unitary model prediction of the bound state is correct , the bound state signal can not be observed separately from the quasi - free contribution in the total spectrum .",
    "the same situation might have occurred in the brookhaven experiment  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the attempt to separate a shallow bound state from the quasi - free contribution by setting @xmath147 seems not to work when the imaginary potential is large .    by all considerations mentioned above",
    ", we think that it is better to set the final proton angle to be zero degree where the difference reflecting the distinct in - medium @xmath6 properties expected to be larger . the energy range measured by the experiment  @xcite did not cover whole energies of the emitted proton where the interesting features , like the deep bound state and the bump structure in the quasi - free region caused by possible level crossing phenomena , take place .      here",
    "we show the formation spectra of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei in the @xmath157 reaction with the @xmath159li target . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:820 ] and [ fig:650 ] for the carbon target , the total spectra were dominated by the @xmath160-wave components @xmath121 since the target nucleus @xmath100c has four neutrons in @xmath160-state while two in @xmath23-state .",
    "then , the @xmath23-wave components are relatively small , which contain the interesting structure such as the bound states and/or the threshold cusp .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:7li ] , we show the spectra of @xmath158li(@xmath161 ) reaction with the elementary process @xmath95 ( one proton picked - up ) .",
    "we see that the @xmath23-wave component now dominates the spectrum for each case ( a ) and ( b ) , since @xmath158li has a single proton in @xmath160-state .",
    "we can find a deep bound state peak in @xmath162 state around @xmath163 mev in the chiral doublet model also in @xmath158li target case while in the chiral unitary case we can see only the threshold peak structure .",
    "we consider that the experimental data with @xmath158li target would be useful and be a complement to that of @xmath100c .",

    ", we discussed the structure of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei formation spectra .",
    "especially , the reduction of @xmath4-@xmath6 mass gap in the nuclear medium were investigated by two chiral models . in the chiral doublet model , @xmath2",
    "is regarded as a chiral partner of nucleon and the mass gap is expected to be reduced in association with the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry in nuclear medium  @xcite . in the chiral unitary approach ,",
    "@xmath2 is introduced as a resonance dynamically generated and described as a quasi - bound state of the kaon and hyperon , and reduction of the mass gap is expected to be small in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "we showed the formation spectra of @xmath0-mesic nuclei by ( @xmath1 ) reactions .",
    "we confirmed that the magnitude of the cross section is large enough to be observed in experiments .",
    "we found that the ( @xmath1 ) reactions were also appropriate to observe the interesting behaviors like deep bound states and the bump structure at the quasi - free region which can be understood by the concept of the level crossing phenomena caused by the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that we can get new information on the in - medium @xmath6 properties through the formation of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei by ( @xmath1 ) reactions .",
    "we also discussed expected background and ways of its reduction by the simultaneous observation of @xmath137 pairs from the @xmath6 decay in medium .",
    "we found that the difference between two treatments of in - medium @xmath6 with and without the reduction of the @xmath4-@xmath5 mass gap are not largely affected by the coincidence observation and there is some chance to make the observation clearer .",
