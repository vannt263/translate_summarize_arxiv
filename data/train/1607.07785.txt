    "most of our present knowledge of the cosmos has come from application of the principles of quantum mechanics and atomic physics .",
    "for instance , the evolution of spectroscopy in every band of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to @xmath1-rays has allowed the study of the supernova remnants , the solar winds , the accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , and the large - scale structure of the universe in a way that we have never imagined to be possible a century ago .",
    "astrophysical processes that involve radiative energy transfer are calculated by the balance between heating and cooling .",
    "analytical prescriptions for the heating and cooling rates in complex environments are only possible under certain limits .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the increasing computer power available today has allowed to model complex astrophysical scenarios efficiently and at a relatively low cost , including the dynamical update of the microphysics and chemistry . non - equilibrium thermodynamics , ionization , molecular states , level populations , and kinetic temperatures of low densities environments are some of the ingredients that have no analytical counterparts and that can be calculated with highly efficient numerical algorithms .    among the several publicly available codes for the calculation of astrophysical environments , @xcite and xstar @xcite have become the most popular because they treat the atomic physics at an _ ab - initio _ level .",
    "in addition , they have the ability to correctly handle a wide variety of scenarios , while predicting the spectrum of different gas geometries , including the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the infrared ( ir ) as well as a broad range of densities up to @xmath2 and temperatures from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) to @xmath3 k. the electronic structure of atoms , the photoionization cross - sections , the recombination rates , and the grains and molecules are also treated in great detail .",
    "in particular , the modeling in includes : i ) photoionization / recombination , ii ) collisional ionization/3-body recombination to all levels , and iii ) collisional and radiative processes between atomic levels so that the plasma behaves correctly in the low density limit and converges naturally to local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) either at high densities or when exposed to  quasi - real \" blackbody radiation fields @xcite .",
    "moreover , collisions , line trapping , continuum lowering , and absorption of photons by continuum opacities are all included as very general processes @xcite .",
    "inner - shell processes are also considered , including the radiative one ( i.e. , line emission after the removal of an electron ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "analytical formulas for the heating and cooling rates have been widely used .",
    "for instance , previous work on accretion onto smbhs in the center of galaxies ( active galactic nuclei , agns ) by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have made use of @xcite analytical formulas for the heating and cooling rates , which are limited to temperatures in the range @xmath4 k and ionization parameters ( @xmath5 $ ] ) in the interval @xmath6 .    in this paper",

    "together with the outflow phenomena , they are believed to play a major role in the feedback process invoked by modern cosmological models ( i.e. , @xmath12-cold dark matter ) to explain the possible relationship between the smbh and the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", spatial resolution permits resolving scales from the kpc to the pc , while subparsec scales are not resolved .",
    "this is why a prescribed sub - grid is employed to solve this lack of resolution . with sufficiently high x - ray luminosities",
    ", the falling material will have the correct opacity , developing outflows that originate at sub - parsec scales .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the present tables provides a tool to solve the problem of accretion onto smbhs in the center of galaxies at sub - parsec scales .",
    "in addition , two seds and three ways of breaking up the luminosity between the disk and the x - ray components are presented . on average , these runs take about 200 minutes using @xmath13 cores ( @xmath14k cpu hours ) of the cinvestav - abacus supercomputer .",
    "there are several radiation hydrodynamics codes that invoke for spectral synthesis .",
    "these codes are used to simulate processes subject to strong irradiation such as the formation and evolution of hii regions , photoevaporation of the circumstellar disks , and cosmological minihaloes .",
    "for example , @xcite combine a sph - based magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) code with for the simulation of the photoevaporation of the hot - jupiter atmospheres .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite combine a finite - volume mhd code with to simulate planetary nebulae .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ radicool ] , we describe the seds used and how they break up between uv and x - ray components .",
    "details of the comparison between photoionization calculations using our two sed bases are also provided .",
    "the calculation of the radiative acceleration as included in the momentum equations is described in section [ radiaccel ] , while section [ mytables ] contains details of the structure of the tables along with the meaning , units , and location in the internet for public use .",

    "a detailed account of the techniques and atomic data can be found in the ( very extended ) documentation of the code , namely hazy1 , hazy2 , and hazy3 .",
    "therefore , many of the details will not be repeated here , but rather we shall focus on describing all the input parameters and code commands in order to accurately reproduce our results . in brief , the problem reduces to have an abstract non - thermal equilibrium multidimensional unit cell ( cloudy cell ) , which is able to return pre - computed physical conditions , that is , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for given values of the hydrogen number density @xmath35 , temperature @xmath36 , distance to the source @xmath37 , and incident angle @xmath38 .    in order for to handle the radiative transfer module , we must specify the geometry to be employed .",

    "the other is a pure 10 kev bremsstrahlung ( dashed - dotted line ) , but in this case we have relaxed the wind model ( see eq .",
