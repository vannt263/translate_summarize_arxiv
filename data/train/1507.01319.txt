    "redshift surveys of galaxies have long been carried out to study the large - scale structure ( lss ) of our universe .",
    "the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) is a statistic that can be easily determined from a well - measured galaxy sample .",
    "theoretical predictions of the 2pcf can also be made from different dark matter models and structure formation scenarios .",
    "thus the 2pcf of galaxies or quasi - stellar objects ( qsos , or quasars ) has been used as an important statistic to distinguish different theoretical models @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most energetic events known to occur in the universe .",
    "they are often associated with the death of massive stars and have a redshift up to @xmath13 .",
    "they are robust indicators of the matter - dense part of the intermediate- or even the high - redshift universe .",
    "their spacial distribution helps explore the lss of the universe .",
    "although recent works suggested that grbs have an anisotropic distribution in the sky @xcite , most studies have demonstrated that grbs are distributed isotropically @xcite , the latter of which is demanded by the cosmological principle .    besides its isotropic distribution in the sky , a homogeneous distribution of the grbs is also expected .",
    "the discovery of a possible structure in the grb sky distribution has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "it has a redshift @xmath14 ( at a distance of approximately ten billion light years away ) and its size is about @xmath15 to @xmath16 mpc .",
    "this excess clustering of grbs has a statistical significance of 3@xmath17 confidence level ( c.l . ) and therefore can not be attributed to the sampling biases at this redshift . in the current structure formation theory ,",
    "structures in today s universe like galaxies and galaxy clusters etc .",
    "all stem from the primordial gaussian random phase fluctuations of the mass density field .",
    "given the finite time from the end of the cosmic inflation to the present , the evolution of the non - linear structures in our universe is limited .",
    "they should not be larger than the scale @xmath18 on which the density contrast becomes @xmath19 at present as predicted by the linear growth theory of density perturbations , the growth of density contrast would have become nonlinear . ] @xcite . since grbs are potential tracers of normal matter , the discovery of this grb structure ( if confirmed by future investigations ) casts new shadows on the cosmological principle as well as the current structure formation theory .",
    "in fact , a number of interesting results have been reported on the homogeneity scale of the galaxy and quasar distributions @xcite . to do a similar clustering analysis on the distribution of grbs",
    ", the correlation function of the grb distribution has to be first measured .    in this work ,",
    "we measure the real - space two - point correlation function @xmath1 of grbs .",
    "we use the catalogue presented by @xcite .",
    "it contains 373 objects over a redshift range of @xmath20 by september 3rd , 2014 .",
    "we subdivide the samples into two redshift regimes : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the 2pcf of each regime is calculated .",
    "we fit a power law to both of the measured @xmath1 . in numerical analysis , we prefer the @xmath2cdm ( cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant ) cosmological model , with @xmath3 over the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe , with @xmath4 .    the rest of the paper is organized as follow : in section 2 , we introduce the methodology of the estimation of the correlation function , including the estimators , the biases , and the error calculations . in section 3.1 , we describe the data we use and the auxiliary random sample . in section 3.2 , we plot the measured @xmath1 for the grbs . in section 3.3 ,",
    "we fit a power law to the measured @xmath1 and give the best - fit values of amplitude and slope .",
    "conclusion and discussions are presented in section 4 .",
    "the 2pcf , @xmath23 , is defined by the probability of finding an object in the spacial volume @xmath24 with another object in @xmath25 that is separated by a distance @xmath26 , i.e. @xcite dp=|n^2[1+(x)]dv_1dv_2 .",
    "@xmath27 is the mean number density of the objects . for statistical estimation of @xmath23 , an auxiliary random sample of @xmath28 points",
    "must be generated in a window @xmath29 .",
    "a window @xmath29 is a three - dimensional space of volume @xmath30 equivalent to that on which the observation is made .",
    "following @xcite , we define the pair count with a unitary function @xmath31 : n_dr(r)=_d_rf ( , ) .",
    "[ dr ] the summation runs over all the coordinates of objects ( represented by @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) in the observed data set @xmath34 and the random sample @xmath35 in the window @xmath29 .",
    "the value of the function @xmath31 equals 1 when the separation of the two objects is within the distance @xmath36 $ ] or otherwise equals 0 .",
    "@xmath37 is the comoving distance between the two objects and @xmath38 is the bin width being used in the statistical estimation of @xmath1 . with these preparations",
    ", we can determine the 2pcf from the observed data .",
    "several estimators of @xmath1 are popular .",
    "one was presented by @xcite , i.e. the dp estimator , _ dp(r)=-1 .",
    "[ dp83 ] @xmath39 is the normalized number of all pairs of grbs in the observed data set and is given as @xmath40 $ ] , where @xmath41 is the total number of grbs in the data set .",
    "@xmath42 is the normalized number of pairs between the data and the random sample with separation of @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "@xmath43 is defined in a similar way as @xmath44 in equation ( [ dr ] ) , while ` @xmath34 ' and ` @xmath35 ' refer respectively to the observed data set of grbs and the auxiliary random catalogue .",
    "two other widely used estimators are the landy - szalay ( ls ) estimator @xmath45 @xcite and the hamilton estimator @xmath46 @xcite : & & _ ls(r)= , + [ xils ] & & _ ham(r)=-1 .",
    "[ xih ] @xmath47 $ ] refers to the normalized number of pairs with the separation mentioned above in the random sample .",
    "@xmath48 is defined in a similar way as @xmath44 in equation ( [ dr ] ) .",
    "a relevant problem for estimating the 2pcf is that there might be systematic biases and stochastic noise which perturbs any real determination of the 2pcf , especially on small - amplitude values of @xmath1 . at small distances , the estimators mentioned above",
    "have very similar performances .",
    "however , on large scales , they are not totally equivalent and some of them could be biased .",
    "generally speaking , for a valid statistical estimator of the quantity @xmath49 , the sample average @xmath50 in a finite volume @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath51 , must satisfy @xcite _ v= x , [ validestimator ] where @xmath52 is the ensemble average . for a finite sample volume @xmath30",
    ", there is a systematic bias in the estimator @xmath53 .",
    "an unbiased estimator is the one that satisfies @xmath54 .",
    "the ls estimator is generally biased as the dp and hamilton estimators .",
    "there are also other two biased estimators that are commonly used , i.e. the natural estimator and the hewett estimator .",
    "numerical tests on artificial distributions have been done to study biases in these estimators @xcite .",
    "it has been found that on large scales , the ls estimator and the hamilton estimator significantly outperform the rest @xcite .",
    "the ls estimator has an indistinguishable performance as the hamilton estimator but is less sensitive to the size of the random sample , @xmath28 .",
    "thus it is more preferable from a practical point of view .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the ls estimator of @xmath1 , while the dp and hamilton estimator are also used for comparison . a detailed comparison of these estimators can be found in @xcite , while alternative estimators ( such as the full - shell estimator and the geometric estimator , etc . ) were proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a limited sample would result in a large likely error or variance . a proper way of estimating errors could reduce this effect to the least .",
    "there are several ways to determine the measured errors of the 2pcf of grbs .",
    "three most common ones are the poisson estimate , the ` field - to - field ' ( ftf ) error , and the jackknife estimate .",
    "the _ poisson _ estimate of the errors of @xmath1 is given as : _ poi(r)=. [ poisson ]    the second method is the _",
    "` ftf ' _ method . in this method",
    ", the whole sample is divided into @xmath55 subsamples .",
    "the 2pcf of each subsample is calculated , i.e. @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the error is calculated by ^2_ftf(r)=_i=1^n_b[_i(r)-(r)]^2 .",
    "[ ftf ] @xmath1 is the estimate of the 2pcf on the entire sample . for our studies ,",
    "the entire sample of grbs , which has a redshift range of @xmath58 $ ] , is divided into seven redshift bins with the interval of 1 .",
    "thus there is @xmath59 .",
    "details of the subsamples are given in table [ table1 ] .    the third way to estimate the errors of @xmath1",
    "is called the _ jackknife _ estimate .",
    "it is given as ^2_jack(r)=_i^=1^n^[_i^ ( r)-(r)]^2 .",
    "[ jackknife ] like the ` ftf ' method , the entire sample is divided into @xmath60 subsamples .",
    "@xmath61 denotes the estimate of the 2pcf on all of the @xmath62 subsamples except the @xmath63-th one .    on small scales",
    "@xmath64 mpc ( @xmath65 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath66 km s@xmath67 mpc@xmath67 ) , all these errors have comparable magnitudes , while above this scale ( up to @xmath68 mpc ) , the jackknife and ` ftf ' errors are considerably larger than the poisson estimate @xcite .",
    "in addition , on small scales , the jackknife method gives smallest fluctuations of the three and is thus more efficient @xcite .",
    "so in this work , we make use of the jackknife method to estimate the errors of the measured 2pcf . like the ` ftf ' error",
    ", we divide the whole grb sample into 7 subsamples as well as 7 redshift bins .",
    "each subsample corresponds to one of these redshift bins .",
    "thus there is @xmath69 .",
    "we use the grb cataloguesee http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/grbgen.html ] presented by j. greiner to determine the 2pcf .",
    "it is a subjective collection of grbs that are detected by a number of satellites and programs , i.e. batse , rxte , bepposax , hete-2 , interplanetary gamma - ray burst timing network ( ipn ) , integral , swift , agile , and the fermi gamma - ray observatory .",
    "the catalogue contains thousands of objects and is updated almost everyday .",
    "we use the data that were released before september 3rd in 2014 . among those 398 objects which have the redshift measured , only 375 of them are well determined .",
    "300 ( about 80@xmath70 ) of them come from one source , the swift satellite .",
    "the rest of the samples come from fermi gamma - ray observatory , hete-2 , and other telescopes . for the others",
    "only an upper limit is provided .",
    "we subdivide these 375 grbs into 10 redshift intervals with effective redshifts from @xmath71 to @xmath72 . in the redshift bins with @xmath73 in the catalogue",
    ", there are only two grbs : the grb 090423 ( @xmath74 ) and the grb 090429b",
    "( @xmath75 ) .",
    "they are omitted in our studies since they have little statistical significance .",
    "therefore , we base our research on these @xmath76 grbs that have redshifts and angular positions well determined .",
    "they cover a redshift range of @xmath20 and we use @xmath69 for the estimates of @xmath1 and the jackknife errors .",
    "robustness of the estimators introduced in the last section has been well demonstrated for a sample of hundreds of objects @xcite .",
    "the grb data we use are listed in table 3 which is publicly available online .",
    "the redshift distribution of the data are presented in table [ table1 ] and figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the density of random points used is 20 times the density of grbs .",
    "we use bin widths of @xmath77 mpc .",
    "the measured values of 2pcf heavily rely on the assumed cosmology in that the comoving separation of the grbs are model dependent . in this work ,",
    "two cosmological models are considered : 1 ) the lambda - cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) cosmological model which uses the parameters determined from the nine - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations @xcite in conjunction with other observations cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum data @xcite , the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data @xcite , and a new @xmath78 measurement @xcite . ] , with @xmath3 ; 2 ) an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) cosmological model , with @xmath4 .",
    "the 2pcfs of the grb data for different densities of the random points are presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "we plot these to study the potential impacts of the statistical noise on the results .",
    "they cover a distance scale up to @xmath79 mpc .",
    "most grb pairs in the data have a separation distance over 100@xmath80 mpc .",
    "the current structure formation theory predicts that on such a scale , the clustering of matter remains in the linear regime even today @xcite . the redshift space distortions due to the small - scale peculiar velocities of the objects and the redshift variances are also minimal on this scale @xcite .",
    "thus the difference between the redshift - space and the real - space correlation functions on such large scales could be negligible .",
    "two other comments on figure [ fig2 ] are necessary .",
    "the first one is that the @xmath1 of grbs is quite scattered on scales below @xmath81 mpc .",
    "the poor performance of the estimates of @xmath1 and its errors on such a scale is due to the lack of data for @xmath82 mpc .",
    "most grbs have been found to have a separation with each other above @xmath81 mpc .",
    "more observations are needed to improve the performance of the analysis on @xmath82 mpc . on the scale @xmath83 mpc",
    ", the results do nt show much difference for varying the objects density in the random catalogue .",
    "thus they are more reliable and can be used to find the possible power law fit of @xmath1 .",
    "the second one is that it shows a ` bump ' at @xmath84 mpc in the measured @xmath1 for the grb sample . for an eds universe ,",
    "it is located at @xmath85 mpc . for different number densities of the random points",
    ", the bump exists , implying that it can not be attributed to statistical noise .",
    "in cosmology , the temperature drop of the universe at about 380,000 years after the big bang would cause a sudden decline of sound speed in the matter fluid .",
    "this would leave the oscillations in it become frozen @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath2cdm model with @xmath3 , the signal manifests as a peak at about @xmath86 mpc in the correlation function for the galaxy distribution @xcite , which is about @xmath81 mpc away from the ` bump ' we discovered .",
    "however , since the size of the grb sample we use is not sufficiently large , whether these two have any physical connections or not is still subject to future investigations .    to study the redshift evolution of the 2pcf for grbs",
    ", the entire grb samples are subdived into two groups with @xmath87 ( 173 objects ) and @xmath88 ( 200 objects ) .",
    "the 2pcfs are calculated for each group for the @xmath2cdm model with @xmath3 and are plotted in figure [ fig3 ] for comparison . from figure [ fig3 ] , it is found that on the scales @xmath89 mpc , the low-@xmath5 group of grb samples have a higher correlation amplitude than the high-@xmath5 group .",
    "this is compatible with the current structure formation theory predicting that the precursors of grbs with low redshifts would have more time to grow and thus would become more correlated with each other .",
    "the differences become small and indistinguishable on scales @xmath90 mpc .",
    "in fact , some previous studies have suggested a @xmath5-increasing correlation behavior in quasars and halos @xcite .",
    "@xcite had reported that the amplitude of the quasar correlation function of the high - redshift samples ( @xmath22 ) was significantly higher than that of the low - redshift sample ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig3 ] , this is not the case for the grb samples .",
    "more discussions are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "a power law of the form ( r)=()^- [ powerlaw ] has been respectively fitted to the 2pcfs of galaxies and galaxy clusters for a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe @xmath91 , using a least-@xmath92 technique . for the case of galaxies , on scales",
    "@xmath93 mpc , the correlation length @xmath94 has a best - fit value of @xmath95 mpc , with the exponent index @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the values vary somewhat from literature to literature depending on the galaxy sample utilized , the estimator used , and the weighting scheme employed , etc . for the case of galaxy clusters , the 2pcf also follows a power law , i.e",
    "@xmath97 , with @xmath98 mpc @xcite .    a power - law model of the same form as equation ( [ powerlaw ] ) has also been fitted to the measured @xmath1 of grbs above @xmath81 mpc in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath99 are determined by a least-@xmath92 procedure . in the @xmath2cdm cosmology , we find a best - fit power law with @xmath100 mpc and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 confidence level ) on scales @xmath10 to @xmath11 mpc . in the eds universe ,",
    "the results are @xmath101 mpc and @xmath102 ( @xmath9 confidence level ) .",
    "the values of @xmath94 and @xmath99 for both cosmological models are presented in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the scale - length @xmath94 in the power law @xmath6 is not very well determined in the analysis .",
    "that is because the data points of measured @xmath103 have large error bars , due to the limited size of the grb sample .",
    "this would be improved once a larger sample of grbs with well - determined redshifts are available for the analysis .",
    "most galaxies have a redshift @xmath87 . for a comparison with the best - fit power law to that of galaxies ,",
    "we fit a power law to those grbs with @xmath87 .",
    "this sub - catalogue contains 173 objects .",
    "we obtained a best - fit @xmath104 @xmath80 mpc and @xmath105 , with @xmath106 .",
    "the best - fit result was presented in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the @xmath9-error bars are calculated from the jackknife method by equation ( [ jackknife ] ) with the @xmath107 .",
    "up to now , the studies of the correlation function @xmath1 have usually been limited to the galaxy samples at low redshift , i.e. @xmath108 . in this paper",
    ", we extended this work to the grbs samples .",
    "many of them have a redshift range of @xmath109 and thus can be used to explore the matter clustering and its evolution in the earlier universe .",
    "we calculated the 2pcf @xmath1 for the grb samples from @xcite .",
    "we considered two popular cosmological model in estimating @xmath1 , a @xmath2cdm cosmology with @xmath3 , and an eds one with @xmath4 .",
    "we found that in the @xmath2cdm universe , the @xmath1 for the grb samples on large @xmath110 ( @xmath111 to @xmath11 mpc ) follows a best - fit power law with @xmath100 mpc and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 confidence level ) .",
    "for the eds universe , the results are @xmath101 mpc and @xmath102 ( @xmath9 confidence level ) .",
    "both correlation functions showed systematic deviations from the best - fit power law below the scale @xmath84 mpc .",
    "we concluded these departures are due to the volume - limited sample , which has insufficient grb pairs with separation below @xmath81 mpc .",
    "in fact , on the scale @xmath112 mpc , the matter distribution in our universe is usually determined by the redshift galaxy survey , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "our work provided a supplement for the measurement of the matter correlation on scales @xmath113 mpc . for a better performance of the measurement of @xmath1 for grbs on smaller scales , which can be used to compare with the results obtained from the galaxy survey below @xmath81 mpc ,",
    "further observations are needed .",
    "in fact , since the grb sample we used is not large enough , one has to take these results with a grain of salt .",
    "besides , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and the planck satellite @xcite have provided unprecedentedly precise measurements of the anisotropy and the inhomogeneity of the matter distribution in the early universe . to answer the questions mentioned above , one may have to use the wmap / planck observational data for a combined analysis . a more careful clustering analysis of the medium redshift universe using the wmap / planck observations together with the quasars and grb data is currently undertaking .",
    "we hope that the results would shed new light on the structure formation theory and the inhomogeneities of our early universe .",
    "we are grateful to zhi - bing li from the sun yat - sen university and zhe chang from the institute of high energy physics for all the useful discussions and suggestions .",
    "the final version of the manuscript has greatly benefited from the careful scrutiny of the referee .",
