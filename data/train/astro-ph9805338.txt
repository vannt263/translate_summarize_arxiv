    "since their discovery as the most distant and luminous discrete objects in the universe , it has been hoped that somehow quasars could be used as `` cosmological candles '' to measure the expansion parameters ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) of the universe . with the discovery of the baldwin effect ( baldwin 1977 ) ,",
    "whereby the emission line equivalent widths scale inversely with the quasar luminosity , that hope is half - realized .",
    "unfortunately , the very large scatter in these correlations ( baldwin , wampler & gaskell 1989 ; kinney , rivolo & koratkar 1990 ; osmer , porter & green 1994 ) have curtailed their usefulness .",
    "what remains is to understand the mechanism of the formation of quasar emission lines well enough so that this scatter can somehow be calibrated in terms of observable parameters , and then removed .",
    "a second major goal of studies of distant quasars is to use them as probes of the first generations of nucleosynthesis in the young universe .",
    "there is evidence of wide variations in the atomic abundances in the blrs of different quasars , and that the spectroscopic effects of this can be measured out to very large redshifts ( hamann & ferland 1992 ; hamann & ferland 1993 : hf93 ; ferland et al 1996 ) .",
    "again , full interpretation requires a proper understanding of the formation of quasar emission lines .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the line strengths strongly depend on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the uv  x - ray range .",
    "( netzer , laor , and gondhalekar 1992 , zheng et al .",
    "1995 , green 1996 , wang et al .",
    "in addition , many studies have found a correlation between @xmath3 and luminosity ( cf .",
    "zamorani et al .",
    "1981 ; wilkes et al .",
    "1994 ; but see also lafranca et al 1995 and avni et al 1995 for discussion of conflicting results ) .",
    "this link through @xmath3 offers a promising explanation of the observed @xmath5@xmath2 relations ( wang et al 1998 ; green 1998 ) .",
    "here we investigate to what extent we can reproduce these observed effects using realistic photoionization models of the blr , and study the degree to which the additional parameter of metallicity must also be taken into account .",
    "we describe the blr in terms of the `` locally optimally - emitting clouds '' ( loc ) model , discussed in baldwin et al .",
    "this model assumes that the many individual gas clouds which make up the blr have a wide range of internal densities and sizes and occur over a wide range in distance from the central continuum source . under these conditions",
    "the emitted spectrum is controlled by powerful selection effects introduced by the atomic physics and basic radiative transfer effects ( see also korista et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the typical observed quasar spectrum is naturally produced .    this picture is supported by the line - continuum reverberation studies , showing that gas having a range of densities must exist over a wide range of radii .",
    "( ferland et al .  1992 ;",
    "peterson 1993 ) .",
    "the spectrum predicted by the loc depends on global integrations , over gas density at a particular location , and over radius .",
    "results depend weakly on the density distribution near those distributions that produce typical quasar spectra , and only somewhat on the radial distribution .",
    "this can be contrasted to single cloud models , which often are described by an ionization parameter ( davidson & netzer 1979 ) and whose predicted spectrum has a powerful dependence on this parameter .",
    "the loc models fit the observed spectrum better with fewer free parameters than do single cloud models .",
    "but more importantly , the loc approach is a more physical model because unless the blr clouds have a remarkably restricted range of properties , we will in fact observe the optimally emitting clouds for most lines .",
    "the emission line spectrum from clouds distributed in gas density and radius is much less sensitive to changes in the gas abundances and sed than is that emitted by a single cloud of a fixed gas density and ionization parameter .",
    "thus analyses that use a single cloud to investigate the expected spectral variations with changes in gas abundances or sed may derive misleading results .",
    "we have generated extensive grids of photoionization models similar to those shown in korista et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and integrated over the cloud properties to obtain predicted loc spectra .",
    "we did this for a wide range of sed and metallicities , with the goal of finding the dependence of the final loc spectra on these two parameters .",
    "to the extent that the geometry is independent of luminosity , this comparison will not be affected at all by the assumed cloud distributions , for which we have just used the standard loc parameters : @xmath11 , an outer radius corresponding to a hydrogen ionizing photon flux of @xmath12 s@xmath13@xmath14 , and @xmath15 , integrated from @xmath16 to @xmath17 @xmath18 ( see baldwin et al .",
    "1995 for definitions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . for simplicity we took the ionizing continuum shape to be a single power law , @xmath21 , and varied the spectral index over the range @xmath22 ,",
    "normalizing each sed to have the same number of photons / s below 912   .",
    "our prescription for abundances is given in table  1 , where `` metals '' refers to all elements except h , he and n. these variations with increasing @xmath6 (= metals / h relative to the solar abundance ratio ) are similar to the hf93 galactic chemical enrichment models whose major feature is that nitrogen is built up as a delayed secondary element , at a rate n / h @xmath23 , with @xmath24 . here",
    "we have chosen @xmath25 , consistent with the rapid star formation enrichment models presented in hf93 .",
    "this particular choice of @xmath26 does not affect the structure of the cloud or the strengths of any non - nitrogen lines in any significant manner .",
    "the helium abundance is scaled gently with @xmath6 as in hf93 , however , for simplicity we have chosen to scale all metals ( excluding n ) with @xmath6 from solar abundances .",
    "figure  1 shows the results for some of the stronger uv lines .",
    "the upper panels show predicted equivalent widths as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath6 , while the bottom panels show corresponding intensity ratios .",
    "as stressed by hf93 , the strength of @xmath271240 relative to either @xmath271549 or @xmath271640 is a good metallicity indicator , as can be seen in the lower - left panel .",
    "the lower - right panel shows these same ratios for @xmath28 and various continuum shapes .",
    "the / and / line ratios have little dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "although the / ratio does become sensitive to the continuum shape if a uv bump is introduced ( factor of @xmath29 variation ; see also ferland et al .",
    "1996 ) , these variations are relatively small compared to the order of magnitude range of observed ratios .",
    "the / ratio is virtually independent ( @xmath30 dex ) of any reasonable quasar continuum .",
    "conversely , the ratios ly@xmath8/ and ly@xmath8/ @xmath271034 are not affected much at all by changes in the metallicity but depend strongly on the continuum shape , showing the steepest dependence on @xmath8 of any of the ratios of strong lines which we examined .",
    "there are several reasons for these dependencies .",
    "the and lines have ionization potentials much higher than hydrogen .",
    "the abundance of these ions relative to hydrogen is sensitive to the form of the continuum between 13.6 ev and 100 ev .",
    "this was the basis of the earlier investigations by zheng et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , green ( 1996 ) and others .",
    "the intensities of these lines depend only weakly on the metallicity because of the strong thermostat effect introduced by such strong cooling lines .",
    "as the abundance of c or o goes up the gas cools more effectively and so the temperature falls as the stronger lines maintain or even diminish in their intensities .",
    "nitrogen lines do introduce a strong metallicity dependence since n is initially a rare element , and its abundance relative to hydrogen goes up as the square of the overall metallicity .",
    "this large increase in abundance does allow the to grow stronger as it takes on more of the cooling .",
    "the equivalent width of @xmath271640 diminishes with increasing @xmath6 as the metals become increasingly important sources of opacity . to a lesser degree",
    "this is also true of ly@xmath8 @xmath271216 .",
    "ferland et al .  ( 1992 ) and shields , ferland , & peterson ( 1995 ) pointed out that ly@xmath8 may be significantly contaminated with other emission ( including @xmath271176 , @xmath271190 , ] @xmath271198 , @xmath271207 , and especially @xmath271216 and ] @xmath271218 ) .",
    "however , the model predictions find that these are contaminants at the level of 8%  15% the intensity of ly@xmath8 over the full range in sed and @xmath6 shown in figure  1 .",
    "our models predict a similar level of contamination to @xmath271034 due to ly@xmath31 @xmath271025 .",
    "neither set of contaminants is important to the results presented here .",
    "in addition to the results shown in figure  1 , we also examined the behavior of the equivalent widths of the @xmath32 ( sum of @xmath33 , ] @xmath34 , ] @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 ( sum of ] @xmath37 , ] @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) blends and of @xmath40 , and of all intensity ratios between the different lines .",
    "note that the predicted strength of the @xmath36 blend does not include emission from uv  34 , a major contributor to this blend in some quasars ( baldwin et al .",
    "1996 ; laor et al .",
    "the four intensity ratios shown in figures 1c and 1d were chosen because they had the strongest dependence on either @xmath8 or @xmath6 , and therefore will give the best leverage for measuring these underlying parameters .",
    "it is possible to directly test the model results with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the work of zheng et al ( 1995 ) and wang et al ( 1998 ) shows that the intensity ratios /ly@xmath8 and /ly@xmath8",
    "directly correlate with an observed indicator of the shape of the ionizing continuum , @xmath3 .",
    "wang et al . show that their /ly@xmath8 data set can be fitted by single - cloud models , provided they choose the correct ionization parameter and gas density .",
    "figure  2 shows that the results from the loc simulations , with @xmath28 , also generally reproduce the observed trends in these intensity ratios , but without requiring adjustable parameters .",
    "many studies have now confirmed the existence of @xmath5@xmath2 correlations for most of the strong emission lines in quasar spectra .",
    "these results are summarized in columns 4 and 6 of table  2 , which list the observed slopes and intercepts of these correlations , taken from the references cited in column 7 .",
    "these observed relationships are such that the strongest effect is seen in followed by , , and then ly@xmath8 .",
    "figure  1b shows that the same sequence results from the loc models , on the assumption that @xmath8 increases ( spectrum becomes softer ) with increasing luminosity .",
    "this lends credence to the idea that the baldwin effect is at least in part due to a systematic change in the incident continuum shape with luminosity .",
    "however , there is a glaring discrepancy between the predicted trends in figures 1b and 1d and the observed behavior of the @xmath271240 line .",
    "the loc models ( and for that matter any single - cloud model ) predict that @xmath5 ( ) should vary as strongly with @xmath8 ( and therefore with luminosity ) as does @xmath5 ( ) , whereas the observations show almost no correlation with @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , / should be nearly independent of @xmath2 , but the work of hf93 shows that higher values of / are systematically found at higher redshifts and/or higher @xmath7 .",
    "figure  6 of osmer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) clearly shows the near absence of an @xmath5()@xmath2 relation , and the correspondingly strong dependence of / on luminosity , for high - redshift quasars .",
    "this must mean that continuum shape is not the only parameter .",
    "figures  1a , 1b suggest the following solution : while most lines @xmath5 diminish with increasing luminosity due to a systematic softening of the sed , a systematic increase in the gas metallicity @xmath6 ( and @xmath41 ) with quasar luminosity could , in the case of , compensate for this loss and result in an @xmath5 that is roughly constant with the quasar luminosity .",
    "note that @xmath5 ( ) decreases by roughly 0.8 dex over the range of @xmath42 , while it increases by virtually the same amount over the range of @xmath43 .",
    "the range in @xmath8 was chosen to represent the observed range for quasars ( zamorani et al .",
    "1981 ; wilkes et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the range in @xmath6 is within the range which might be at least reasonable according to population synthesis models ( hf93 ) , and a detailed study by ferland et al ( 1996 ) shows that in some quasars @xmath6 must be greater than at least 5 .",
    "thus for the observed range of seds , there is a reasonable range in @xmath41 that can offset the expected change in @xmath5 ( ) , provided that both sed and @xmath6 depend on @xmath7 .",
    "the models do not tell us how to map @xmath8 into @xmath7 . for the present study",
    ", we simply adopt the empirical @xmath44 relation found by wilkes et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ; thus we adopt their choice of @xmath45  @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this gives the effective 2500   to 2  kev continuum slope ( @xmath3 ) ; we made a slight adjustment in its logarithmic zero point to reference the continuum luminosity at 1550   .",
    "since the line equivalent widths and continuum - shape sensitive line ratios are observed to correlate with @xmath3 , the latter must be strongly correlated with the true measure of the ionizing continuum s hardness .",
    "wang et al .  (",
    "1998 ) defined an @xmath4 , a measure of the ratio of fluxes at 1350   and 1  kev , closer to the ionizing photons , and reaffirmed this assertion in a large sample of quasars .    as an initial guess at the @xmath48 relation",
    ", we assumed a metallicity @xmath49 for the lowest luminosity sources and @xmath50 for the highest .",
    "this is consistent with the slopes of the / and / dependences on @xmath2 given by hf93 ( their fig .",
    "7 ) , when mapped back to metallicity @xmath6 using our fig 1a .",
    "since @xmath7 and @xmath3 are also correlated , we simply assigned @xmath28 to @xmath51 , @xmath52 to @xmath53 , and a power law in @xmath3 and @xmath6 in between . then using the relationship between @xmath54 and @xmath3 , this example results in the simple power law relation @xmath55 .",
    "the range in @xmath3 and @xmath6 results in a range in @xmath54 of @xmath56 to @xmath57 @xmath58 .    in the spectral simulations",
    ", we assumed a simple power law continuum sed and so @xmath3 is identical to @xmath8 : 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.6 , 1.8 . in accordance with the above expression each power law sed",
    "was then assigned to its respective metallicity @xmath6 : 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 .",
    "four separate grids of cloud emission were then computed and integrated , as described above .",
    "the resulting predicted emission line / continuum relations and their observed counterparts are given in table  2 . in each case",
    "the predicted relationships were fitted with a straight line , usually a good approximation .",
    "the slopes @xmath31 and intercepts @xmath59 are listed in the table , where the fit is to @xmath60 . in four cases ,",
    "a significant break in the slope of the predicted relation forced a double - power law fit , and both relations are given .",
    "the simulated @xmath5 for each emission line is referenced to the continuum at 1215   and a global covering fraction of 0.5 is assumed .",
    "these affect only the intercepts , not the slopes . finally , we point out that relationships involving @xmath54 in table  2 are not strictly comparable , since different investigators ( column 7 ) assumed different values of the deceleration parameter @xmath9 ( all assumed @xmath45  @xmath46 ) . when known , the assumed values of @xmath9 are listed in the footnotes of table  2 .",
    "the effect of different choices of @xmath9 is non - uniform in the @xmath5@xmath2 plane , and its effect on the @xmath5@xmath2 slope can be comparable to the typically quoted uncertainty in the slope s measurement of @xmath61 .    given the simplicity of our assumptions , the predicted relationships match the observed ones surprisingly well .",
    "the general lack of a @xmath5@xmath2 relationship in and the trends in the different slopes for different lines are reproduced .",
    "we note that while the overall behavior of the / vs. / relationship is matched very well by our models , we do not reproduce the highest observed values .",
    "the primary reason for this is that our models do not predict a large enough @xmath5 ( ) at a given @xmath2 . of the lines studied here",
    ", this line will be by far the most sensitive to the choice of abundances ( see figure  1b ) . under our hypothesis",
    ", our simulations also predict that the line ratios ly@xmath8/ and @xmath271900/ should increase with increasing @xmath2 , as is observed ( osmer et al .",
    "this is simply a result of differing slopes of their respective @xmath5@xmath2 relations .",
    "many investigators have suggested this change in the spectrum to be due to a shift in ionization parameter to lower values at larger @xmath2 ( e.g. , mushotzky & ferland 1984 ) .",
    "however , we would argue that this change in the line spectrum is due to a characteristic shift to softer incident continua and higher @xmath6 with increasing @xmath2 . of these two effects , the metallicity has the largest impact on the @xmath271900/ ratio .",
    "observationally , the challenge will be to tighten these and other key global relationships .",
    "table  2 shows that these stronger lines of quasars do carry sufficient information to constrain the proposed evolution of the sed and @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "we have shown here that including a @xmath6@xmath7 effect in addition to a sed@xmath7 relation allows us to simultaneously reproduce the observed correlations with @xmath7 of the equivalent widths and intensity ratios of all of the strong uv lines , particularly . as a secondary element , nitrogen s rapidly increasing abundance with increasing @xmath6 compensates for the losses in @xmath5 ( ) emitted by gas illuminated by softer continua in higher luminosity quasars . for a _ fixed _",
    "sed , an increasing gas metallicity reduces the @xmath5 of the stronger lines of other heavy elements ( the gas cools ) and that of ly@xmath8 and especially ( because of the increasing metal opacity ) , while the weaker metal lines ( e.g. , intercombination lines such as ] 1909 ) generally respond positively .",
    "weak lines such as ] @xmath271402 , formed in the he@xmath62 zone , suffer from the significant drop in temperature and their intensities remain roughly constant with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "the interplay between the effects of a changing sed and @xmath6 with @xmath7 results in the observed luminosity dependent spectral variations .",
    "however , the photoionization models only predict relations with @xmath8 and @xmath6 . to get to relations with @xmath7 we have had to adopt both an @xmath8@xmath7 relation , and a @xmath6@xmath7 relation .",
    "these two relations or at least their combined effect must still be calibrated empirically , from comparing emission line parameters to continuum fluxes , before the baldwin effect can be used as a real luminosity indicator for cosmological tests .",
    "why should we expect a global relationship between @xmath6 and quasar luminosity ? hf93 and ferland et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that the average / and / ratios increase systematically with redshift and/or luminosity .",
    "they attributed this change in line ratios to an increase in metallicity , as we do here .",
    "hf93 proposed that the luminosity dependence of metallicity is really a mass - metallicity relation .",
    "because of their deeper potential wells , higher - mass galaxies are better able to retain gas deposited during stellar evolution than are lower - mass galaxies , so they have a more rapid buildup of heavy elements in their nuclear regions . coupling this scenario with observations showing that the most luminous quasars tend to reside in the most massive galaxies ( mcleod & rieke 1995a , 1995b ; bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ) leads to a natural explanation for a global relationship between quasar luminosity and gas metallicity . to the extent that luminosity evolution affects individual quasars ,",
    "the redshift - metallicity dependence would also require a steady decrease in metallicity with time in individual objects .",
    "hf93 suggested that this was due to dilution by lower-@xmath6 gas falling into the nuclear regions throughout the lives of these galaxies .",
    "in addition , the simplest accretion disk models predict that more luminous quasars should in general emit softer continua ( netzer et al .",
    "1992 ) , though the continuum emission mechanism is far from understood .",
    "together , these form the basis of the proposed global @xmath7sed@xmath6 relationship .    can the noise in the baldwin effect be eliminated , much as an observer corrects for reddening ?",
    "metallicity should scale with the mass of the host galaxy and not necessarily the quasar luminosity , thus introducing noise .",
    "the importance of this effect can be estimated from figure  3 , which compares the observations of osmer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to the range covered by our models on the @xmath5()@xmath7 diagram as metallicity is varied from half solar to ten times solar .",
    "just making a correction on the basis of the / ratio may remove much of the scatter at high redshifts ; this is something that can be tested empirically .",
    "there are likely to be additional sources of scatter as well : a spread in @xmath8 at given @xmath7 ; the strength of any additional euv bump above a simple power - law continuum ; variations in the cloud distributions ; line and continuum emission anisotropies ; variability ( the effects of line  continuum lags and the intrinsic baldwin effect ; kinney , rivolo , & koratkar 1990 ; pogge & peterson 1992 ) .",
    "our aim is to use the more accurate blr model described here together with the measurements of critical line and continuum strengths to distinguish between as many of these effects as possible and guide us in their empirical calibration .",
    "even a factor of two reduction in the scatter would be an important gain in our ability to use these diagrams for cosmology .",
