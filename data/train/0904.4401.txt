    "the compounds with a common chemical formula _ _ at__o@xmath0 ( _ _ a__=na or li , _ _ t__=3_d _ transition metals ) have been attracting a lot of attention for their large variety and richness in physical phenomena@xcite .",
    "indeed , the discovery of supercondctivity in the na@xmath4coo@xmath0@xmath51.3h@xmath0o@xcite and the application of licoo@xmath0 in rechargeable li batteries have accelerated investigations on their fundamental physics . in addition , namno@xmath0 undergoes a structural phase transition at 45 k to a long - range ordered antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state@xcite , while nanio@xmath0 exhibits ferromagnetic ( fm ) coupling in ni - ni plane below transition temperature@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a well - known member of this group , linio@xmath0 , has no long - range magnetic ordering even at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "the orbital frustration has been used to explain the absence of magnetic ordering@xcite , and a local ordering of ni@xmath6 jahn - teller ( j - t ) orbitals is also proposed to be responsible for the complex magnetic properties@xcite . therefore , its controversial magnetic properties have been attracting considerable interest .",
    "these various phenomena always relate to the quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) triangular lattice formed by _",
    "_ cations .",
    "such a triangular lattice may lead to magnetic frustration , since all nearest - neighbor afm interactions can not be satisfied simultaneously@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic frustration can be relieved by a certain orbital ordering ( oo)@xcite , such as in livo@xmath0@xcite and navo@xmath0@xcite .",
    "livo@xmath0 has been found to form a spin - singlet phase with corresponding oo at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "whereas , its sister compound navo@xmath0 displays very different behaviours .    recently , onoda _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite have revealed a superparamagnetic state driven by the short - range ordered spin-1 ( the total spin in one trimer s=1 ) trimerization@xcite below the transition temperature ( _ _ t__=98 k ) .",
    "however , mcqueen _ et al . _ have reported two successive oo transitions in navo@xmath0@xcite . at 98 k , the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from a rhombohedral ( _ r_-3_m _ ) phase to a monoclinic ( _ _ c__2/_m _ ) one , corresponding to the proposed oo of one electron per v@xmath6 . below 93 k , the system undergoes a discontinuous phase transition to another monoclinic ( _ _ c__2/_m _ ) phase , consistent with the proposed oo of two electron per v@xmath6 .",
    "in addition , a long - range ordered afm state is formed at low temperatures , while the magnetic moment observed in the ordered phase is about 0.98 @xmath7@xmath8 , much smaller than the expected value ( 2 @xmath7@xmath8 ) .",
    "the controversial magnetic states below 98 k obtained by these two groups bring us interests , and the puzzling magnetic moment deserves to be explored .",
    "there are no theoretical reports yet to the best of our knowledge , therefore we expect to understand its magnetic properties at low temperatures upon our theoretical efforts .    in the present work ,",
    "we have performed first - principles calculations to investigate the electronic structures of navo@xmath0 , further to reveal the most possible orbital and magnetic ordering , and to explore the origin of small magnetic moment observed at low temperatures .",
    "partially in agreement with the experimental findings@xcite , the oo , accompanied by a long - range magnetic ordering , is found for the second monoclinic structure . and the observed magnetic moment",
    "can be explained by including the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the crystal structure and computational details are described briefly in sec . slowromancap2@. and",

    "slowromancap3@. finally , a brief conclusion is summarized in sec .",
    "the lattice parameters provided by mcqueen _",
    "et al . _ are listed in table slowromancap1@. the structure of navo@xmath0 is composed of 2d triangular - lattice vo@xmath0 layers of edge sharing vo@xmath9 octahedra separated by sodium ions , which is rhombohedral ( _ r_-3_m _ ) at relatively high temperature ( ht ) ( _ _ t__@xmath1098 k ) and monoclinic ( _ _ c__2/_m _ ) in both intermediate temperature ( it ) ( 91.5 k@xmath11__t__@xmath1198 k ) and low temperature ( lt ) ( _ _ t__@xmath1191.5 k ) phases@xcite . at 100 k ,",
    "the v - o distances are nearly 2.04  , but the o - v - o angle @xmath12 is only _ 85.53@xmath13 _ ( fig .",
    "1 ) . with lowering the temperature , @xmath12",
    "further reduces to _ 85.42@xmath13 _ at 91.5 k and _ 85.13@xmath13 _ at 20 k. therefore , even in the ht phase , vo@xmath9 octahedra in navo@xmath0 have been different from the regular ones under a trigonal distortion of compression along the threefold ( 111 ) axis@xcite , which induces the lowering of the _ o@xmath14 _ local symmetry to _ d@xmath15_. in vo@xmath0 layers , the v - v geometry is built by two long ( 3.00781  ) and four short ( 2.99316  ) bonds in the it phase , and reversely is by two short ( 2.97551  ) and four long ( 3.00526  ) ones in the lt phase@xcite .",
    "the interlayer v - v distance is about 5.6  .",
    "all the calculations were performed by using the standard full - potential linearized augmented plane wave code wien2k@xcite .",
    "the muffin - tin sphere radii of 2.22 , 2.00 and 1.77 a.u . were chosen for the na , v and o atoms , respectively .",
    "the cutoff parameter r@xmath16k@xmath17 was chosen to be 7.0 and 100 _ k_-points were used over the first brillouin zone .",
    "the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) of perdew and wang@xcite was used for the exchange and correlation potential . in order to take the strong - correlated nature of 3__d",
    "_ _ electrons into account explicitly , we performed lsda+u calculations@xcite , where _ _ u@xmath18__=_u_-_j _ ( _ u _ and _ j _ are on - site coulomb and exchange interaction respectively ) was used instead of _ _ u__@xcite .",
    "and the orbital - dependent potential has the form of @xmath19__v__@xmath20 = -_u@xmath18_(__@xmath21__@xmath22 - @xmath23__i__)@xcite , where _ _ @xmath21__@xmath22 is the orbital occupation matrix of spin @xmath24 .",
    "this type of double - counting correction ( dcc ) has been called the fully localized limit@xcite . for navo@xmath0",
    ", we used _ _",
    "u@xmath18__=3.6 ev which has been used in its sister compound livo@xmath0@xcite .",
    "note also that the conclusion made in this paper is not affected for _ _ u@xmath18__=2 - 6 ev@xcite . to explore the origin of small magnetic moment observed in the lt phase , we performed lsda+soc+u calculations , where the soc is included by the second - variational method with scalar relativistic wave functions@xcite .",
    "the easy magnetization direction was set along ( 110 ) direction ( short v - v bonds in the lt phase ) observed in the experiment@xcite .    in order to investigate different magnetic patterns , 2@xmath252@xmath252 supercell was used in our calculations .",
    "we took into account two afm structures in v - v plane as described in fig .",
    "2(a ) : slowromancap1@-type antiferromagnetism ( fig .",
    "2(a)(i ) ) is afm exchange along the ( 010 ) and ( 110 ) directions with fm exchange along the ( 100 ) direction , slowromancap2@-type antiferromagnetism ( fig .",
    "2(a)(ii ) ) is afm exchange along the ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) directions with fm exchange along the ( 110 ) direction .",
    "totally there were five possible magnetic configurations in our calculations for the it and lt phases ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) : ferromagnetic ( fm ) , _ c_-afslowromancap1@ ( slowromancap1@-type antiferromagnetism in plane , fm stacking ) , _ c_-afslowromancap2@ ( slowromancap2@-type antiferromagnetism in plane , fm stacking ) , _ g_-afslowromancap1@ ( slowromancap1@-type antiferromagnetism in plane , afm stacking ) , _ g_-afslowromancap2@ ( slowromancap2@-type antiferromagnetism in plane , afm stacking ) .",
    "as the paramagnetic behavior of navo@xmath0 has been determined from the magnetic susceptibility measurements in the ht phase@xcite , we just focus on the electronic structure instead of its magnetic properties .",
    "the band structures obtained from lsda and lsda+u calculations are shown in fig .",
    "3 . within lsda ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , the bands near the fermi level ( _ e@xmath26 _ ) are mainly derived from v 3__d _ _ states . since straight v - o - v paths are not present in layered navo@xmath0 and instead only nearly _ 90@xmath13 _ v - o - v bonds exit , the v 3__d _ _ states are quite narrow . in the approximately octahedral crystal field ,",
    "orbitals are split into upper _",
    "e@xmath3 _ and lower _",
    "t@xmath1 _ states .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , _ e@xmath3 _ derived bands range from 1.5 to 2.5 ev and _ t@xmath1 _ derived bands lie between -1.5 and 0.5 ev .",
    "the splitting between _",
    "t@xmath1 _ and _ e@xmath3 _ bands is about 1 ev . under the trigonal crystal field ,",
    "the _ t@xmath1 _",
    "orbitals are further split into one _ a@xmath2 _ and two degenerate _",
    "e@xmath3 _ orbitals .",
    "however , the splitting is much less than the band widths so that the _ t@xmath1",
    "_ orbitals still cross the _ e@xmath26 _ , which denotes a metallic state within lsda .",
    "that is to say , lsda calculations can not reproduce the insulating nature of navo@xmath0 from experiment@xcite .",
    "the lsda+u scheme@xcite is thus used to count the strong correlation of v 3__d _ _ electrons . as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the empty _",
    "a@xmath2 _ band is pushed upwards by about 1 ev , and a gap is opened near the _ e@xmath26_. the system is hence an insulator due to electron correlation and navo@xmath0 is indeed a good candidate for mott - hubbard insulator .    according to the pure crystal field theory , the _ a@xmath2 _",
    "orbital is of lower energy than the _ e@xmath3 _",
    "orbitals under the trigonal distortion of compression , which is opposite to our lsda+u results .",
    "so it is necessary to discuss the controversy on relative order of _",
    "a@xmath2_-_e@xmath3 _ in such trigonal distortions . in ref",
    "@xcite , landron and lepetit pointed out that this relative order is strongly influenced by the _ e@xmath3_-_e@xmath3 _ hybridization .",
    "the _ e@xmath3 _ and _ e@xmath3 _ orbitals belong to the same irreducible representation ( _ e@xmath3 _ ) and can thus mix despite the large _",
    "t@xmath1_-_e@xmath3 _ energy difference .",
    "such a mix may be small but it modulates large energetic factors : the on - site coulomb repulsions . when the",
    "_ e@xmath3_-_e@xmath3 _",
    "hybridization is taken into account , the energy difference @xmath19__e _ _ between the _ a@xmath2 _ and _ e@xmath3 _ orbitals depends on two competitive parts : @xmath19__e _ _",
    "= @xmath19__e@xmath27 _ _ + @xmath19__e@xmath0 _ _ = @xmath28(_a@xmath2",
    "_ ) - @xmath28(_e@xmath3 _ ) . @xmath19__e@xmath27",
    "_ _ includes the kinetic energy , the electron - charge interaction , and the interaction with the core electrons .",
    "@xmath19__e@xmath0 _ _ denotes the repulsion and exchange terms within the 3__d _ _ shells .",
    "additionally , @xmath19__e@xmath27 _ _ and @xmath19__e@xmath0 _ _ both depend on the amplitude of the trigonal distortion and are of opposite effect with each other . under a trigonal distortion of compression ,",
    "if we only consider the crystal field effect ( @xmath19__e@xmath27 _ _ ) , the _ a@xmath2 _",
    "orbital is of lower energy than the _ e@xmath3",
    "_ orbitals ( @xmath19__e _ _ @xmath11 0 ) .",
    "whereas if we take @xmath19__e@xmath0 _ _ into account , the relative order between the _ a@xmath2 _ and _ e@xmath3 _ orbital is reversed ( @xmath19__e _ _ @xmath10 0 ) , comparing with the crystal field prediction .",
    "therefore , lsda+u calculations predict that the _ a@xmath2 _",
    "orbital is of higher energy than the _ e@xmath3 _ orbitals in navo@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , such a controversy has been presented in another compressed triangular system na@xmath29coo@xmath0@xcite . from the crystal field theory , some",
    "authors@xcite proposed that the energy of _ a@xmath2 _",
    "orbital is lower than the _",
    "e@xmath3 _ orbitals .",
    "however , the lda+u method@xcite yielded an _",
    "orbital of higher energy than the _",
    "e@xmath3 _ orbitals .",
    "later , the experimental results@xcite showed that the fermi surface of the coo@xmath0 layers issues from the _ a@xmath2 _",
    "orbital , not at all from the _ e@xmath3 _ orbitals , supporting the lda+u results .",
    "the triangular lattice of navo@xmath0 exhibits magnetic frustration and spatially anisotropic exchange interactions in the it phase . as shown in table slowromancap2@ , the _",
    "g_-afslowromancap1@ configuration is the most stable state among the five magnetic structures both from lsda and lsda+u calculations . by a detailed analysis of the magnetic ground state _ g_-afslowromancap1@ ,",
    "2(a)(i ) , afm chains are formed along the ( 110 ) direction ( long v - v bonds ) , while afm exchange is also more favorable along the ( 010 ) direction ( short v - v bonds ) .",
    "considering all the short v - v bonds are completely equivalent , both of the ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) directions should be afm exchange .",
    "thus , navo@xmath0 in the it phase can be regarded as a system with frustration effects .",
    "in addition , spatially anisotropic exchange interactions may exist in such a triangular spin lattice@xcite , i.e. , _",
    "j@xmath27 _ along the direction of long v - v bonds and _ j@xmath0 _ along the two directions of short v - v bonds ( fig .",
    "2(a)(i ) ) .    in order to describe the magnetic frustration and spatially anisotropic exchange interaction more clearly",
    ", we estimate the exchange interactions along one of the triangle directions ( _ j@xmath27 _ ) and the other two ( _ j@xmath0 _ ) ( fig .",
    "2(a)(i ) ) .",
    "since all the configurations exhibit insulator characteristics , the spin size of v is stable , and the difference of total energy between _ c_-afslowromancap1@ and _ g_-afslowromancap1@ ( _ c_-afslowromancap2@ and _ g_-afslowromancap2@ ) configurations ( see table slowromancap2@ ) is so small that the system exhibits a 2d characteristic , a nearest neighbor heisenberg - like hamiltonian may be a good primary approximation for the in - layer magnetic energy .",
    "the corresponding 2d spin hamiltommian can be written as @xmath30 where ( _ i , j _ ) denotes a nearest - neighbor pair ( short v - v bond ) and ( _ k , l _ ) denotes a next - nearest - neighbor pair ( long v - v bond ) . by mapping the obtained total energies for each magnetic state to the heisenberg model , the exchange interactions _",
    "j@xmath27 _ and _ j@xmath0 _ were calculated within this approximation : @xmath31 @xmath32 with s=1 , we get _ _ j@xmath0__=2.1 mev and _ _ j@xmath27__=6.1 mev for navo@xmath0 in the it phase , which reflects strong spatial anisotropy .",
    "the afm chains are established along the ( 110 ) direction ( _ j@xmath27 _ ) and the interchain coupling ( _ j@xmath0 _ ) is frustrated .",
    "moreover , the value of _ j@xmath0_/__j@xmath27__=0.3 is so small that this magnetic structure can be described as so - called weakly coupled _ zigzag _ ( s=1 ) chains model@xcite",
    ".    the integer spins ( s=1 ) are able to weaken the frustration effects in the frustrated systems , as in kagom lattice@xcite .",
    "such a lattice has four nearest neighbors with the adjacent triangles on the lattice sharing only one lattice point .",
    "interestingly , the triangular lattice can be composed of four kagom lattices@xcite .",
    "thus , there are some analogous properties in these two frustrated systems .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to suppose that the triangular lattice also has the rule that the half - odd - integer spins are more highly frustrated than integer ones .",
    "for example , natio@xmath0 ( @xmath33)@xcite and licro@xmath0 ( @xmath34)@xcite with half - odd - integer spins are always frustrated even at low _ t _ , while the magnetic frustration of namno@xmath0 ( _ _ s__=2 ) is clearly lifted by a structural distortion@xcite .",
    "besides namno@xmath0 , navo@xmath0 is another typical triangular lattice with integer spins ( s=1 ) .",
    "therefore , we can presume that the magnetic frustration in navo@xmath0 can be lifted in some way .      from the discussion above",
    ", we expect that navo@xmath0 with s=1 will show a long - range magnetic ordering or a finite ground - state magnetization at low _ t_. as shown in table slowromancap2@ , _",
    "g_-afslowromancap2@ is only 0.3 mev lower in total energy than _",
    "c_-afslowromancap2@ within lsda , and both _ g_-afslowromancap2@ and _ c_-afslowromancap2@ have the same lowest total energy from lsda+u results for the lt phase .",
    "this reflects the obvious 2d characteristic of navo@xmath0 : the interlayer interaction is much weaker than the intralayer one . as stacking antiferromagnetically between layers is observed in the experiment@xcite , _",
    "g_-afslowromancap2@ state should be more favorable at low _",
    "t_. such a magnetic state denotes the long range 3d magnetic ordering with afm coupled fm chains in v cation layers and interlayer afm coupling .",
    "obviously , the magnetic frustration is lifted in _",
    "g_-afslowromancap2@ state by the first - order transition at 91.5 k : the lattice distorts to another monoclinic ( _ _ c__2/_m _ ) with four long and two short v - v bonds reversed , comparing with it phase .    the lattice distortion , which relieves the frustration , is driven by the formation of oo in the lt phase .",
    "4 shows the orbital characteristic of v 3__d _ _ in _ g_-afslowromancap2@ state . since the orbital occupancies of the two inequivalent v ( v1 and v2 in fig .",
    "2(a)(ii ) ) are nearly the same , only the density of states ( dos ) of v1 3__d _ _ is shown .",
    "the _ z _ axis of local coordinate system coincides with the v - o bond of the vo@xmath9 octahedra .",
    "in such a coordinate system , _ d@xmath35 _ and _ d@xmath36 _ orbitals are mainly occupied and _ d@xmath37 _ orbital is less occupied at all v ions . such an orbital occupancy is consistent with the oo proposed by mcqueen and cava@xcite : the _ d@xmath35 _ and _ d@xmath36 _ orbitals are singly occupied with all unoccupied _ d@xmath37 _ orbitals .",
    "this oo relieves the magnetic frustration and stabilizes the long - range magnetic ordering state . in view of",
    "the weak superexchange interaction resulted from the nearly _",
    "90@xmath13 _ angle of v - o - v@xcite as well as the weak magnetic interaction between adjacent vo@xmath0 planes interleaved by a layer of na ions , the v - v direct exchange interaction in - plane should be dominant in such a particular crystal structure . particularly , we only consider the @xmath24 overlap in v - v direct exchange , which is much stronger than the @xmath38 overlap .",
    "it means that each orbital in a v ion only hybridizes with the same orbitals in the two nearest - neighboring v ions . that is to say , _",
    "orbital hybridizes with two neighboring _",
    "d@xmath36 _ orbitals in the ( 010 ) and ( 010 ) directions , and _ d@xmath35 _",
    "orbital hybridizes with two neighboring _",
    "d@xmath35 _ orbitals in the ( 100 ) and ( 100 ) directions .",
    "the repulsions between the occupied orbitals ( _ d@xmath35 _ or _",
    "d@xmath36 _ ) induce the elongation of v - v bonds along four directions : ( 010 ) , ( 010 ) , ( 100 ) and ( 100 ) . according to the goodenough - kanamori ( gk ) rules@xcite ,",
    "the strong afm coupling should exist along these four directions because of the occupation of two orbitals with @xmath24 overlap . at the same time , the less occupancy of _ d@xmath37 _",
    "orbital leads to v - v bonds contraction as well as a weak fm exchange along the ( 110 ) and ( 110 ) directions .",
    "thus , the four long and two short v - v bonds result from bonding via _ d@xmath35 _ , _ d@xmath36 _",
    "orbitals , but no bonding of the _ d@xmath37 _ electrons .",
    "in other words , such an oo results in the lattice distortion , and consequently relieves the magnetic frustration .    in the lt phase ,",
    "another important aspect is that the soc turns out to be crucial for the small magnetic moment of 0.98 @xmath7@xmath8 per v@xmath6 observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "as shown in table slowromancap2@ , the magnetic moments from lsda+u calculations are much larger than the ones observed in the experiment . further to investigate the magnetic moments changing with the particular choice of _",
    "u@xmath18 _ , we calculate the moments for _ _ u@xmath18__=2 - 6 ev and find that the moments are not sensitive to _ u@xmath18 _ : as shown in table slowromancap3@ , the magnetic moments stay constant within 0.2 @xmath7@xmath8 as long as the system is an insulator . since an easy magnetization direction ( 110 )",
    "is observed in the exprement@xcite , the soc may play an important role in determining the total magnetic moment .",
    "thus , the soc is included to reinvestigate the magnetic moment .",
    "then , we perform lsda+soc+u calculations for the favorable magnetic configuration ( _ g_-afslowromancap2@ ) , and obtain a local moment of 0.89 @xmath7@xmath8 per v@xmath6 with 1.65 @xmath7@xmath8 spin and -0.77 @xmath7@xmath8 orbital contributions",
    ". this value is half the expected moment ( 2 @xmath7@xmath8 ) , but very close to the observed one ( 0.98 @xmath7@xmath8 ) .",
    "the dos projected on ( 2,m ) space shown in fig .",
    "5 reveals the origin of orbital moment .",
    "note that the _ z _ axis is set to the direction of easy magnetization along ( 110 ) now . since _",
    "d@xmath27 _ and _ d@xmath39 _ have nearly the same occupancies , the orbital moment only comes from the contribution of different occupancies between _ d@xmath0 _ and _",
    "d@xmath40_. by further analysis , the _ d@xmath0 _ occupancy is less than one half of the _ d@xmath40 _",
    "one , which should give an orbital moment between 1 @xmath7@xmath8 and 2 @xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , there is no surprising that the calculated orbital moment is 0.77 @xmath7@xmath8 here , because some hybridization effects are neglected in above analysis , e.g. , the covalence effects with o 2__p__. thus , the inclusion of soc leads to a surprising but experimentally sound results .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the electronic structure and magnetic properties of navo@xmath0 by first - principles calculations .",
    "the _ t@xmath1 _",
    "orbitals are split into upper _",
    "a@xmath2 _ and lower _",
    "e@xmath3 _ states by a trigonal distortion of compression in the ht phase , which is similar to the splitting in na@xmath29coo@xmath0@xcite . in the it phase",
    ", the crystal symmetry is lowered to _ _",
    "c__2/_m _ , under which the system behaves like a frustrated spin lattice with spatially anisotropic exchange interactions .",
    "finally , a long - range ordered afm ground state is formed when the magnetic frustration is relieved by another lattice distortion resulted from a certain ordering of occupied orbitals at low _",
    "t_. the small magnetic moment observed originates from the compensation of orbital moment for the spin moment .",
    "it is obvious that so many physical phenomena in the triangular lattice are reflected in navo@xmath0 , suggesting that navo@xmath0 is a very good model material for studying 2d triangular lattice systems .",
