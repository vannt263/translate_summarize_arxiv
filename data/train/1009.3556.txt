    "+ kifer ( 2000 ) was the first to broach the problem of valuation for american - style options with a cancellation feature available to the short side of the contract . in that article",
    ", kifer applied the continuous time game theoretic results of lepeltier and maingueneau ( 1984 ) to these generalized american options and found the fair price was equal to the value of a dynkin game ( see e.g. dynkin ( 1969 ) , neveu ( 1975 ) ) between the long and the short sides of the contract .",
    "the close relationship between these options and dynkin games fostered a renewed interest in such games and subsequently brought forth general existence and characterization results about the value of a dynkin game ( see e.g. alvarez ( 2008 ) , ekstrm ( 2006 ) , ekstrm and villeneuve ( 2006 ) , ekstrm and peskir ( 2008 ) , peskir ( 2008 ) ) . with respect to game options , kuhn , kyprianou , and van schaik ( 2007 ) recently extended valuation results in a complete market framework to include more general payoffs than those considered in kifer ( 2000 ) .",
    "recent results in an incomplete market setting include kuhn ( 2004 ) , and hamadne and zhang ( 2008 ) .",
    "+ since game - type derivatives are generalized american - style options , explicit solutions are rare in many settings . however , kyprianou ( 2004 ) explicitly solved , under the black - scholes framework , the valuation problem associated to a particular game - type derivative known as the perpetual israeli @xmath1-penalty put option .",
    "this analysis was limited to a put option on a non - dividend paying asset following geometric brownian motion . within this framework",
    ", kyprianou found that the strike price was the only asset value for which optimal contract termination would occur .",
    "this result for the put option is intuitive and , perhaps , suggests similar behavior for its call option counterpart . following that article ,",
    "kuhn and kyprianou ( 2007 ) addressed the finite expiry put option valuation problem and found its explicit representation as a compound exotic option . in the following discussion",
    ", we consider the valuation problem of a perpetual game call option on a dividend paying asset .",
    "recently , kunita and seko ( 2004 ) considered the finite expiry version of this contract . here",
    ", we utilize some of the same arguments while attempting to explicitly solve the valuation problem . in doing so",
    ", we find significant qualitative differences with kunita and seko s finite expiry analysis and important distinctions from the work done by kyprianou ( 2004 ) on an infinite expiry game put option with a non - dividend paying asset .",
    "most recently , alvarez ( 2009 ) explicitly characterized both the value and the optimal exercise policy of a minimum guaranteed payment game option when the underlying asset price follows a general linear , time homogeneous diffusion .",
    "the payoff structure alvarez ( 2009 ) considered is , indeed , very similar to a game call option since the payoff of the former upon exercise by the holder is @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "our analysis here is distinct from alvarez ( 2009 ) since a regular call option payoff assumes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "namely , the value of the claim corresponds to its price under the policy of exercising at the first time the underlying asset reaches an optimally chosen value @xmath65 and under the policy of terminating the contract when the asset value first reaches the strike price @xmath70 .",

    "this striking result implies that the price is not a convex function for all values of the underlying asset .",
    "further , numerical solutions for the valuation problem show that the value function is not necessarily non - decreasing in the volatility parameter .",
    "this phenomenon directly relates to the existence of non - convex pieces of the value function .",
    "finally , we observe significant price savings over the perpetual call option .",
    "this savings might be especially appealing to purchasers seeking a call option position who are willing to assume the risk of cancellation .",

    "we can neglect the first three factors of the above derivative since they are all positive . from this point",
