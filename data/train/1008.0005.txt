    "located in the virgo cluster , m84 ( ngc 4374 ) is an elliptical galaxy with a radio - loud active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . according to @xcite , the agn is optically classified as a type 2 low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) .",
    "m84 is known to contain a circumnuclear gas disk @xcite , providing the opportunity to measure the mass of the central black hole if the gas participates in circular rotation in a thin disk - like structure . following the installation of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) , m84 was the first target for a gas - dynamical measurement of its black hole mass @xcite .",
    "gas - dynamical measurements had previously been made for several objects using data from the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) and faint object camera ( foc ) @xcite , but stis provided a dramatic improvement in data quality for spatially - resolved emission - line spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite showed that the m84 gas kinematics could be modeled as a disk in circular rotation .",
    "however , near the m84 nucleus , the stis spectra are very complicated with severely blended , double - peaked , and asymmetric h@xmath7 and [ ] line profiles .",
    "@xcite interpreted the complex nature of the emission lines as arising from two kinematically distinct gas components .",
    "one high velocity gas component was thought to be part of the nuclear gas disk rotating about the black hole , while the other low velocity component was believed to be an extension of a filamentary structure seen on larger scales .",
    "@xcite therefore included only the high velocity component in their modeling , and determined a black hole mass of @xmath8 .",
    "an alternative explanation for the complex line profiles seen near the m84 nucleus was suggested by @xcite .",
    "they argued that a rapidly rotating disk could give rise to the complex line profiles and that the complicated spectra are due to a slit width that is larger than the core of the telescope point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the location at which light enters the slit affects the inferred velocity , creating an instrumental velocity gradient along the dispersion direction . in the case of m84 , @xcite identified a `` caustic '' that occurs where the instrumental velocity offset balances the change in velocity due to the gas rotating about the black hole .",
    "they used the location of the caustic to estimate a black hole mass of @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , @xcite attempted to model the complex line profiles in m84 and found that the double - peaked and asymmetric profiles could be qualitatively reproduced with a single , rapidly rotating disk component observed through the stis 02-wide slit , however they were unable to determine a black hole mass because a direct fit of the modeled line profiles to the data was not well constrained .",
    "m84 has a stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath10 km s@xmath11 , and the black hole in m84 lies near the high - mass end of the correlations between black hole mass and host - galaxy properties , such as those with the bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ; @xcite ) and bulge luminosity ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these relationships imply that the growth of black holes and bulges are intimately linked , and the correlations have crucial implications for galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "properly determining black hole masses at the high - mass end of the relationships is particularly important because those measurements will have a substantial effect on the slope and scatter of the relationships , which in turn affect the inferred black hole mass function . additionally , accurate mass measurements of black holes at the upper - end of the @xmath5 relationship are necessary in order to address questions about whether the @xmath5 or @xmath6 relationship is more fundamental @xcite .",
    "recent work has suggested that some black hole masses at the high - mass end of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 relationships may have been underestimated in previous stellar dynamical measurements . in the case of m87 , which contains one of the largest measured black holes , @xcite found that including the galaxy s dark matter halo in the stellar - dynamical modeling increased the inferred black hole mass by a factor of @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite re - examined the stellar kinematics of ngc 4649 , another galaxy harboring a high - mass black hole , and found a factor of @xmath4 increase to @xmath14 from the original stellar - dynamical mass measurement . unlike m87 , the addition of a dark matter halo had a minor effect on the black hole mass .",
    "instead , the mass increase was attributed to the different orbital sampling  the orbital coverage from the previous model did not adequately sample the phase space occupied by tangential orbits . also , @xcite investigated the effects of using triaxial stellar - dynamical models for a couple of objects that were originally modeled as axisymmetric systems . using a triaxial geometry in place of an axisymmetric shape had a significant effect on one of the objects ( ngc 3379 ) , and the black hole mass increased by a factor of @xmath4 to @xmath9 . while the black hole in ngc 3379 does not fall at the high - mass end of the @xmath5 and @xmath15 relationships , @xcite note that triaxial systems may be prevalent at the high - end of the relationships .",
    "these issues provide a renewed motivation to pursue gas - dynamical measurements in massive , early - type galaxies .",
    "since gas - dynamical measurements of black hole masses rely on gas in circular orbits at small radii , within the black hole s dynamical sphere of influence , they are insensitive to the large - scale effects of a dark matter halo or stellar orbital anisotropy .",
    "thus , they can serve as an important cross - check to the much more complex stellar - dynamical models .",
    "the spectra of m84 illustrated by @xcite show that the black hole s dynamical sphere of influence is extremely well resolved in the stis data ; this is demonstrated by the nearly keplerian falloff in rotation velocity with distance from the nucleus .",
    "this makes m84 a particularly valuable object for constraining the upper end of the @xmath5 relation .",
    "the discrepancy between the masses derived by @xcite and by @xcite has remained troubling , and there are a variety of possible explanations .",
    "the modeling of @xcite was based on the decomposition of the emission - line profiles into rotating and non - rotating components , but the models calculated by @xcite clearly illustrated how a rotating disk observed through a wide slit could give rise to the complex line profiles seen in m84 .",
    "also , the models calculated by @xcite did not include all of the detailed effects relevant to propagation of emission - line profiles through the stis optics that were later explored by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others ; these effects could plausibly have a substantial impact on the derived black hole mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass derived by @xcite was based on the visual identification of a caustic feature in the velocity field and not from quantitative fits of models to the data , hence the uncertainty in their estimate of @xmath16 is difficult to gauge .",
    "furthermore , neither @xcite nor @xcite included any possible effects due to an intrinsic velocity dispersion in the disk or asymmetric drift in their modeling .",
    "many nuclear gas disks in early - type galaxies exhibit an internal velocity dispersion that may be dynamically important ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the physical origin of the intrinsic velocity dispersion is not understood , and early gas - dynamical models did not include the possible effect of the intrinsic velocity dispersion on the black hole mass .",
    "in contrast , more recent gas - dynamical models account for the possibility that the intrinsic velocity dispersion provides dynamical support to the disk @xcite .",
    "the extremely broad emission lines near the center of the m84 disk suggest that there could be a dynamically significant internal velocity dispersion , which could have a substantial impact on the measured black hole mass .    in this paper , we aim to resolve the uncertainty in the m84 black hole mass by revisiting the archival stis observations and carrying out more comprehensive dynamical modeling than has previously been attempted for this galaxy .",
    "we describe the archival _ hst _ stis observations in  [ sec : obs ] and the measurement of the emission lines in  [ sec : measurement ] .",
    "we then present the observed emission - line velocity , velocity dispersion , and flux in  [ sec : velfields ] . in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss the specifics of our gas - dynamical model . we provide details of the stellar mass profile , the emission - line flux distribution used in the model , the contributions from various sources to the line widths , and the asymmetric drift correction .",
    "the final disk models ( both with and without an asymmetric drift correction ) are presented in  [ sec : modelresults ] , and we quantify the possible sources of uncertainty in  [ subsec : errors ] . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we compare our black hole mass measurement to past results . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a distance to m84 of 17.0 mpc in order to be consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "m84 was observed under program go-7124 ( see @xcite ) with the stis ` 52x0.2 ` aperture and no gaps between the three adjacent slit positions .",
    "the slit was aligned at a position angle of 104  east of north , approximately perpendicular to the radio jet and near the major axis of the gaseous disk .",
    "the ccd was read out in an unbinned mode giving a wavelength scale of @xmath17 pixel@xmath11 and a spatial scale of @xmath18@xmath19 pixel@xmath11 .",
    "the g750 m grating was used to provide coverage of @xmath20@xmath21  , which includes the h@xmath7 , [ ] @xmath22 , and [ ] @xmath23 emission lines .",
    "the exposure times ranged from @xmath24 to @xmath25 s per slit position , with two individual exposures at each position .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard space telescope science institute ( stsci ) pipeline .",
    "the pipeline includes dark and bias subtraction , flat - field corrections , and the combining of subexposures to reject cosmic rays .",
    "the data were flux and wavelength calibrated , and rectified for geometric distortions .",
    "before the geometric rectification , we performed an additional cleaning step to remove any hot pixels or cosmic rays that remained in the flux - calibrated images .",
    "we also obtained wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) f547 m , f658n , and f814w images from the _ hst _ archive , originally observed under program go-6094 . in each image ,",
    "the nucleus was centered on the pc detector .",
    "the images for each of the filters were taken as a sequence of two individual exposures , and we used the iraf combine task to average the exposures together and reject cosmic rays . however , a number of cosmic rays remained even after using the combine task , and so we applied an extra cosmic ray cleaning step to the combined image using the la - cosmic task @xcite .",
    "the total exposure times were 1200 s , 2600 s , and 520 s for the f547 m , f658n , and f814w images , respectively .",
    "we created a continuum - subtracted h@xmath7 + [ ] image by subtracting a scaled combination of the f547 m and f814w images from the f658n image .",
    "we experimented with different scaling factors , and searched for a set of factors that would produce a background region in the continuum - subtracted image with a mean flux as close to zero as possible . in figure",
    "[ fig : wfpc2image ] , we show the continuum - subtracted image with the location of the stis slits overlaid , as well as the f547 m wfpc2 image .",
    "as previously described by @xcite , the emission - line image reveals a compact central source surrounded by an extended disk - like structure that traces the nuclear dust disk .",
    "we extracted spectra from individual rows of the 2d stis image out to about 085 from the slit center .",
    "the rows were extracted as far out as the emission lines were detectable .",
    "far from the slit center , where the emission lines were weak , we binned together multiple rows to improve the s / n . before fitting the emission lines , we removed the continuum from the spectrum . for each row",
    ", we fit a line to the continuum regions between rest - wavelengths @xmath26@xmath27   and @xmath28@xmath29  , and then subtracted the continuum fit from the spectrum . generally , a straight line is not a good description of the continuum near h@xmath7 , but with the low s / n in the continuum at most positions and the small wavelength range , we could not perform a more accurate subtraction .",
    "we applied a levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization technique using the mpfit library in idl @xcite in order to fit each spectrum with a set of gaussians , following the same technique described by @xcite .",
    "we used the propagated error spectra to weight the data points during the fit .",
    "for all but the three innermost rows of the central slit , we simultaneously fit five gaussians to the h@xmath7 , [ ] @xmath30 , and [ ] @xmath23 emission lines .",
    "all the lines were required to have a common velocity , and the fluxes of the [ ] lines were held at a @xmath31 ratio .",
    "the widths of the [ ] lines were required to be the same . also , the [ ] lines were constrained to have equal velocity widths .",
    "spectra extracted from the central slit position at 015 and 010 from the nucleus clearly exhibit double - peaked line profiles .",
    "our basic model described previously provides a good fit to the spectra at 015 and 010 , but we also tried fitting two gaussians to each emission line ( representing two kinematically distinct gas components ) . while the two - component model fits the spectra very well at these locations , the @xmath32 per degree of freedom ( @xmath33 ) decreased by less than 12% compared to the basic model .",
    "the basic model , however , did not return adequate fits for the spectra extracted from the innermost three rows of the central slit position , which have a very complex , asymmetric shape with severely blended h@xmath7 and [ ] lines that may be double - peaked .",
    "we then applied an additional constraint to the basic model that required the widths of the h@xmath7 and [ ] lines to be equal .",
    "even with this model , the fit was poor and it was impossible to obtain accurate and unique mean velocities , velocity dispersions , or fluxes .",
    "the velocity dispersion values were very large , ranging from @xmath34  900 km s@xmath11 , and the best - fit gaussian appeared to be systematically shifted blueward of the peak [ ] @xmath35 flux in all three rows .",
    "we also tried fitting a number of more complicated models , such as adding a single gaussian broad component to the h@xmath7 + [ ] complex or fitting a two - component model .",
    "these more complex , multi - component fits were not well constrained by the data , often resulting in gaussian components with zero flux . moreover , including a broad component in the fit usually resulted in unreasonably small fluxes and line widths for the h@xmath7 and [ ] narrow components , although these models did seem to provide a better estimate of the mean velocity than the previous fitting attempts .",
    "past work by @xcite has interpreted these complex line profiles as arising from two separate gas components .",
    "they fit two gaussian components at number of locations within 03 from the nucleus , and only used one of the two components in order to derive a black hole mass . however , as described above , modeling by @xcite and @xcite has shown that the line profiles can be described by a rotating disk model rather than requiring two dynamically distinct components .",
    "our detailed modeling further supports this interpretation and will be discussed in  [",
    "sec : modelresults ] .",
    "thus , for the spectra located at 015 and 010 , we use the fit results from the basic model , with one gaussian component for each narrow emission line .    in the three innermost ccd rows of the central slit position",
    ", the complexity and blending of the line profiles prevents an accurate decomposition into gaussian components , and it is not clear whether a broad h@xmath7 component is even present .",
    "the broad wings on the h@xmath7 + [ ] complex could plausibly result from either a compact broad - line region , or from the rapid rotation of the innermost , unresolved portion of the emission - line disk , or both .",
    "thus , we consider all measurements from these central three rows to be unreliable , and we do not use them to constrain our dynamical models . since the line profiles in these central three rows are dominated by psf blurring and rotational broadening , they add relatively little useful information to constrain the disk models , and we will show in  [ sec : modelresults ] that the modeling results are insensitive to the values of the observed velocity from these central three stis rows",
    ". however , for reference in the remaining figures presented in the paper , we continue to plot the mean velocity ( measured from a fit using the basic model along with a single gaussian broad component and a constraint requiring the widths of the narrow h@xmath7 and [ ] lines to be equal ) .",
    "we do not show the velocity dispersion or flux measurements from the central three rows in these figures though because we were unable to obtain reasonable measurements from any of our fitting attempts .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spec_examples ] , we show a few examples of the basic model fit to the spectra extracted from the central slit position at @xmath3601 and @xmath36015 from the nucleus .",
    "we also display the fits to the spectra from the innermost three rows using the basic model plus an additional line width constraint , as well as the basic model along with a single gaussian broad component and a line width constraint on the h@xmath7 and [ ] narrow components .    in order to estimate the uncertainties on the free parameters , we used a monte carlo technique . for each row",
    ", we generated new spectra by adding random gaussian noise to the original spectrum , where the 1@xmath37 level of the perturbation was set by the residuals between the best - fit model and the original spectrum .",
    "the new spectra were then refit , and the 1@xmath37 uncertainties were taken to be the standard deviation of the distribution .",
    "this method resulted in velocity and velocity dispersion errors that were typically 27% and 40% larger , respectively , than the formal uncertainties from the best - fit model .",
    "from the fits to the [ ] @xmath38 emission line , we obtained the velocity , velocity dispersion , and flux , and we plot these values as a function of position along the slit in figure [ fig : velplots_dataonly ] .",
    "we defined the galaxy center ( y - offset = 0 ) to be the row with the largest continuum flux , which also coincided with the peak of the narrow [ ] @xmath38 emission - line flux .",
    "the grey open squares mark the three central rows where the complex line profiles precluded any definitive measurements of the [ ] mean velocity , velocity dispersion , or flux .",
    "these grey points mark the velocity of the [ ] emission peak as determined by the fits that included a broad h@xmath7 component . for reference",
    ", we also show the best - fit systemic velocity determined from our gas - dynamical modeling .",
    "the multi - slit velocity curves show the gas participates in regular rotation .",
    "there is a steep velocity gradient across the inner 02 of slit position 2 , where the radial velocity drops from 1380 km s@xmath11 at y - offset = @xmath3901 to 740 km s@xmath11 at y - offset = 01 .",
    "the radial velocities measured from slit position 3 show that the gas located to the southwest of the nucleus is mostly redshifted relative to the galaxy s systemic velocity , while the data from slit position 1 show that the gas to the northeast of the nucleus is mostly blueshifted .",
    "the [ ] @xmath38 line widths measured from the central slit position are large , with velocity dispersions of @xmath40 km s@xmath11 and @xmath41 km s@xmath11 at y - offset = @xmath3901 and 01 , respectively . the line widths continue to rise toward the nucleus . however , due to the complexity of the spectra , which are severely blended together due to the large rotational broadening and the psf blurring , we were unable to obtain reliable measurements of the velocity , velocity dispersion , or flux from the innermost three stis rows .",
    "the velocity field was modeled assuming that the gas is in circular rotation in a thin disk - like structure .",
    "we follow a method similar to that outlined by @xcite , and we refer the reader there for a more detailed discussion of the model . at each radius @xmath42 in the disk ,",
    "we determine the circular velocity relative to the systemic velocity ( @xmath43 ) , based on the enclosed mass @xmath44 , which depends on the black hole mass ( @xmath16 ) , the stellar mass profile , and the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the stellar contribution to the circular velocities will be discussed in  [ subsec : stars ] .",
    "we then project the disk velocity field onto the plane of the sky for a given value of the disk inclination @xmath46 in order to determine the line - of - sight projection of the rotation velocity at each position in the inclined disk .",
    "we generated the model velocity field on a highly subsampled pixel grid ; each model pixel was 10@xmath47 oversampled relative to the stis pixel size .",
    "previous studies have used smaller subsampling factors of @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "however , we found that a large subsampling factor was necessary in order to sufficiently capture the considerable changes in velocity that occur over small spatial scales near the m84 nucleus , and to more accurately model the steep emission - line flux profile .",
    "we experimented with a range of subsampling factors ( @xmath50 ) , which will be discussed further in ",
    "[ sec : modelresults ] , before settling on a subsampling factor of @xmath51 .",
    "we calculate the intrinsic line - of - sight velocity profiles on a velocity grid with a bin size that matches the stis pixel scale of 25.2 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the intrinsic line - of - sight velocity profiles are assumed to be gaussian before passing through the telescope optics .",
    "the gaussian profiles are centered on the projected line - of - sight velocity at each point on the model grid .",
    "furthermore , the line - of - sight velocity profiles are weighted by the emission - line flux distribution ( to be discussed in  [ subsec : emissionline_sb ] ) .",
    "the width of the intrinsic line - of - sight velocity profiles ( to be discussed in  [ subsec : linewidths ] ) includes contributions from the thermal velocity dispersion of the gas , the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) for stis , and an intrinsic turbulent velocity dispersion .",
    "the model velocity field is then synthetically `` observed '' in a manner that matches the stis observations .",
    "this synthetic observation includes accounting for the blurring by the telescope psf .",
    "we used tiny tim @xcite to create a 10@xmath47 oversampled 03@xmath4703 portion of the full stis psf for a monochromatic filter passband at 6600  .",
    "although a 03-diameter psf model excludes part of the stis psf wings , there is a negligible effect on the inferred black hole mass , as will be demonstrated in  [ sec : modelresults ] . each velocity slice of the line profile grid",
    "is then convolved with the oversampled 03@xmath4703 tiny tim psf model .    after accounting for the telescope psf",
    ", we propagate the model velocity field through the stis slit .",
    "the stis slit is allowed to lie at some angle @xmath52 from the projected major axis of the gas disk , and the slit can be displaced some distance along the slit width ( @xmath53 ) and along the slit length ( @xmath54 ) from the black hole .",
    "we included the shifts in velocity that arise as a result of the finite slit width .",
    "the velocity shifts occur because a photon s recorded wavelength depends on the location along the slit width at which the photon enters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the velocity shifts have been made , we rebin the resulting emission - line profiles to the stis pixel size .",
    "thus , we are left with a model 2d spectral image similar to the stis data .",
    "we convolve the model 2d spectral image with the ccd charge diffusion kernel .",
    "the ccd charge diffusion kernel is given by tiny tim for model psfs that are subsampled , and it represents the charge that is spread between the immediate neighboring ( non - subsampled ) pixels .",
    "finally , spectra are extracted on a row - by - row basis from the model stis 2d image .",
    "we fit a single gaussian to the emission line , analogous to the measurements of the emission lines from the stis data .",
    "we are thus able to measure the model velocity , velocity dispersion , and flux as a function of position along the slit .",
    "we then determine the best - fit model parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath43 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) that produce a model velocity field that most closely matches the observed velocity field over a region ( @xmath55 ) that extends from @xmath3905 to 05 for each slit position .",
    "however , we do not include the uncertain velocity measurements from the innermost three stis rows in the fit .",
    "we measure the black hole mass and the @xmath32 from the model fits to the observed velocity only , after separately optimizing the model fits to the observed line widths and fluxes as described below .",
    "the observed [ ] line widths and fluxes are not directly dependent on the black hole mass , so the black hole mass is determined from the fit to just the radial velocity curves .      in order to account for the stellar contribution to the gravitational potential , we modeled the intrinsic density distribution of the central regions of m84 as the sum of spherically symmetric components with gaussian profiles , as done by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "within such a multi - gaussian framework @xcite , projecting the model density profile on the sky to match the observed surface brightness is fairly simple given the properties of the gaussian function .",
    "this is particularly true when the instrumental psf is also expressed in terms of gaussian functions .",
    "once the ( non - negative ) amplitudes of the gaussian density components have been determined , the contribution of each gaussian to the stellar potential can be conveniently evaluated in terms of error functions .    for m84 , we deprojected the @xmath56-band surface brightness profile of @xcite , who combined large scale ground - based images with high - resolution _ hst _ nicmos @xmath57-band data for the central , dusty region .",
    "since the nicmos psf is fairly complex , we took particular care to describe it in terms of gaussian components by matching to a nic2 f205w psf generated with tiny tim .",
    "a careful representation of the psf is important in the presence of an active nucleus , as in the case of m84 , because it affects the isolation and removal of an agn component from the stellar mass budget .",
    "the luminosity profile of m84 contains a compact central component .",
    "@xcite show that this central component is due to the agn itself and not a nuclear star cluster , so the light from this component should not contribute to the stellar mass profile .",
    "in order to determine the impact of this component on the mass models , we computed two different deprojected stellar mass profiles , one in which this central component was assumed to be agn light , and another in which it was assumed to be starlight with the same stellar mass - to - light ratio as the rest of the galaxy .    in figure",
    "[ fig : stellarvc ] , we present the final product of the multi - gaussian deprojection of the surface - brightness profile of m84 , that is , the stellar contribution to the circular velocity in the galaxy . the circular velocity due to a @xmath58 @xmath59 black hole is also illustrated , since this is a plausible lower limit to the black hole mass based on our results and those of @xcite .",
    "the figure illustrates that the stellar contribution to the circular velocities is extremely small over the radial range probed by our data ( @xmath60 ) , even for the lowest reasonable value of @xmath61 .",
    "the stellar contribution is negligibly small regardless of whether the central compact component in the light profile is assumed to be a star cluster or an agn .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig : stellarvc ] indicate that the total mass within the inner 05 is likely to be dominated by the black hole .",
    "in other words , the black hole s dynamical sphere of influence is extremely well resolved by the stis observations ; this is consistent with the nearly keplerian shape of the velocity profile along the central slit position . as a result",
    ", our model fits should be fairly insensitive to the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , as we describe below , our dynamical models do not provide any useful constraints on @xmath45 , and we simply assume a fixed value of @xmath45 for our final model fits . in our dynamical models , we used the circular velocities derived under the assumption that the central compact component represents agn light .",
    "as discussed above in  [ sec : model ] , the model line - of - sight velocity profiles are weighted by the emission - line flux at each point in the disk .",
    "past gas - dynamical models have used either an analytic form to describe the intrinsic emission - line flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the continuum - subtracted h@xmath7 + [ ] image directly , after deconvolution with the telescope psf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that folding the deconvolved continuum - subtracted image into the model calculations can account for small - scale irregularities in the velocity field .",
    "however , our attempts to use a deconvolved image of m84 were unsuccessful , and the dynamical model produced poor fits to both the observed flux and velocity .",
    "it appeared that the deconvolved continuum - subtracted image could not adequately characterize the steepness of the nuclear emission - line light on subpixel scales .",
    "we therefore experimented with analytic forms of various complexity for the intrinsic flux distribution .",
    "we searched for the simplest function that would sufficiently reproduce the observed [ ] flux profile while simultaneously producing model velocities closest to the observed velocities .",
    "we tested parametrizations that were composed of two to four components , and the components were either gaussian functions [ parametrized as @xmath62 , exponential functions [ parametrized as @xmath63 , or constants .",
    "we experimented with models representing intrinsically circularly symmetric disks ( producing concentric elliptical isophotes with constant position angle and axis ratio ) , as well as more complicated models where the isophotes of the individual components were allowed to have different centers , positions angles , and axis ratios .",
    "the parameters for each possible surface brightness model were determined by computing disk models including the parametrized surface brightness model , calculating the resulting model line profiles as described above in  [ sec : model ] , measuring the emission - line fluxes in the resulting model , and then optimizing the fit of the modeled fluxes to the observed [ ] flux distribution by minimizing @xmath32 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find that radio galaxies in particular ( including m84 ) often show evidence for nuclear velocity dispersions in excess of those expected from pure gravitational motions .",

    "models that do not account for this effect will lead to black hole mass measurements that underestimate the true mass . although it is unclear whether the intrinsic velocity dispersion actually does provide dynamical support to the disk , we include an asymmetric drift correction in our model to estimate an upper limit to the m84 black hole mass , following the methods previously described by @xcite .    briefly , if we assume that the gas motions are isotropic in the @xmath42 and @xmath79 ( cylindrical ) coordinates , then asymmetric drift correction is given by    @xmath80 \\;.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath81 is the number density of tracer particles or clouds in the gaseous disk , and we assume that intrinsic radial velocity dispersion @xmath82 can be described by an exponential + constant of the same form as equation [ eq : sigmar ] . for a given parametrization of @xmath82 , we determine @xmath83 and the projected velocity dispersion following the method described by @xcite .",

    "by modeling the m84 emission - line gas kinematics as a dynamically cold , thin disk in circular rotation , we find a best - fit black hole mass of @xmath167 .",
    "incorporating an asymmetric drift correction in our disk model results in a best - fit black hole mass of @xmath168 .",
    "we favor the disk model with an asymmetric drift correction because it is physically plausible that the intrinsic turbulence affects the disk s dynamics and also because the model provides a better fit to the observed radial velocities .",
    "there are a few caveats associated with the asymmetric drift correction worth mentioning .",
    "our treatment of the asymmetric drift correction is only an approximation , and the black hole mass measurement becomes increasingly less certain as @xmath169 approaches @xmath170 . in the case of m84",
    ", we find that @xmath169 can reach moderate values of 0.57 ( see figure [ fig : sigmarvc ] ) .",
    "moreover , the increase in the black hole mass when an asymmetric drift correction is applied is extremely large ( a 98% change ) , and can be attributed to the very steep radial gradients in both @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "while @xmath82 is known fairly well through a fit to the observed line widths , the radial distribution of the number density of clouds in the disk is not known . following past work",
    ", we have used the emission - line flux profile as a proxy for the density profile @xmath120 . while this is at best a rough approximation",
    ", we found that different parametrizations of @xmath81 did not result in substantial changes to the inferred black hole mass .",
    "however , if instead a very simplistic asymmetric drift correction is applied , where @xmath171 , the black hole mass decreases by @xmath172% to @xmath173 . finally , the asymmetric drift correction is strictly applicable in the limit of collisionless particles , as in stellar dynamics .",
    "here , we are applying the correction to gas clouds , which are not collisionless particles , and therefore the analogy is not perfect , although it is still a useful approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , calculating a model which includes an asymmetric drift correction is an informative exercise , but only provides an approximate indication of the dynamical influence of the intrinsic velocity dispersion .",
    "additionally , dust obscuration is an issue in m84 and affects both our gas dynamical models .",
    "as can be seen in the wfpc2 @xmath56-band image in figure [ fig : wfpc2image ] , there are two prominent dust lanes within the central @xmath174  that are oriented roughly east to west . based on a @xmath175 color map , @xcite",
    "measure a dust mass of @xmath176 , and note that the dust extinction is the greatest along the northern portion of the central dust lane and at a patch located on the nucleus .",
    "the effects of dust on the determination of the stellar mass profile should be minimized , as the @xcite surface brightness profile uses nicmos @xmath57-band data for the nuclear region .",
    "also , as we have shown above , the model fits are insensitive to the stellar mass contribution because the black hole dominates over the region we are modeling .",
    "dust extinction will affect the observed gas kinematics , however including these effects in the calculation requires radiative transfer models of the disk s gas dynamics .",
    "such modeling has yet to be applied to gas kinematical measurements and is beyond the extent of this paper .",
    "the best - fit black hole mass of @xmath177 is a factor of @xmath4 smaller than the mass measured by @xcite of @xmath178 , although the two measurements are formally consistent within their quoted uncertainties .",
    "if we consider our best - fitting model that does not include asymmetric drift ( perhaps a more fair comparison since bower et al .  did not include asymmetric drift ) , our result is a factor of @xmath179 smaller than theirs .",
    "while there are many factors that contribute to this difference , one reason is likely to be the different assumptions we have made about the structure of the velocity field .",
    "bower et al .",
    "decomposed the emission lines into two distinct kinematic components , which they characterized as one rotating disk component and one unrelated , low - velocity component , while we have modeled the kinematics as arising from a single rotating disk .",
    "the observed and modeled line profiles of the central slit position , shown in figure [ fig:2dmodel ] , help to illustrate the situation .",
    "close to the nucleus , the emission lines flare out into a broad `` fan '' of emission with large line widths and complex , strongly non - gaussian profiles , due to a combination of instrumental and rotational broadening , and the increase in the intrinsic velocity dispersion close to the nucleus .",
    "@xcite describe in detail how this fan of emission , which can mimic the appearance of two separate kinematic components , can be generated through the combination of rotational broadening and the effects of observing through a slit that is wider than the psf core .",
    "moreover , our model calculation includes a more detailed treatment of the telescope and spectrograph optics than was carried out by @xcite , and includes the full propagation of emission - line profiles through the spectrograph , rather than a simpler propagation of mean velocities . while it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the difference in the resulting black hole mass , these are likely to be the primary reasons .",
    "our results show that we can obtain a robust fit of a disk model to the data even in the absence of any measurements from the central three rows , where the line profiles are most severely blended and asymmetric and the velocity field is most strongly affected by psf blurring .    of the remaining disk model parameters ,",
    "our best - fit systemic velocity and inclination angle of @xmath180 km s@xmath11 and @xmath181 differ from the results of @xcite , who found @xmath182 km s@xmath11 and @xmath183 .",
    "the systemic velocity determined through our modeling is in better agreement with the recession velocities given by the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the velocities quoted by ned were measured from optical lines , and ranged in value from 954  1119 km s@xmath11 , with an average of 1025 km s@xmath11 .",
    "@xcite did not fit for the relative angle between the stis slit and the major axis of the gas disk .",
    "rather , they took the disk position angle to be that of the major axis of the large - scale emission - line structure ( 83@xmath110 east of north ) measured by @xcite . in our disk models , we allowed @xmath52 to be a free parameter and found a similar position angle for the major axis of the gaseous disk .",
    "our best - fit value is @xmath184 , corresponding a disk major axis position angle of 76@xmath110 east of north .",
    "also , @xcite adopted a stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath185 ( @xmath56-band solar units ) , comparable to the one fixed in our model of @xmath133 ( @xmath56-band solar units ) .",
    "the comparison of our results with those of @xcite is less direct , since they did not carry out model fitting to the observed velocity field .",
    "instead , they estimated the black hole mass based on the visual location of a caustic feature in the spectrum of the central slit position .",
    "this caustic results from the interplay between the disk rotation and the gradient in instrumental wavelength shifts across the slit . these two line - broadening effects can be oppositely directed and can effectively cancel each other out , resulting in a sharp reduction in the observed line width at a specific location in the disk .",
    "we do not clearly see evidence for this caustic feature in the 2d spectrum or in the measured emission - line widths , so we can not reproduce their estimate of @xmath16 . while such caustics should in principle",
    "occur in stis spectra of emission - line disks , it is possible that the intrinsic line width in the m84 disk is so large that it washes out any observable signature of the caustic .",
    "we note , however , that our best - fitting model without asymmetric drift gives a result that is consistent with that of @xcite .    with respect to the @xmath5 and @xmath15 relationships ,",
    "our best - fit black hole mass for m84 of @xmath168 is a factor of @xmath4 smaller than the mass from @xcite that has been most often adopted in the relationships .",
    "this new mass measurement lies closer to the mass expected from the @xmath5 and @xmath6 relationships measured by @xcite .",
    "recent stellar dynamical studies of other galaxies , as well as our analysis of m84 , show that some previous black hole mass measurements should be re - evaluated , and determination of the true shape and scatter of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 relationships is an evolving process that will continue to change as observations and modeling techniques continue to improve .",
    "recent calibrations of the relations still include some of the early gas - dynamical measurements that were done with the fos on _ hst _ , and these should be particularly important targets to revisit with future observations .",
    "equally important are cross - checks between gas - dynamical and stellar - dynamical techniques within the same object , as each mass measurement method suffers from independent systematic uncertainties .",
    "in particular , gas - dynamical models would benefit tremendously from a better understanding of the physical origin and the dynamical influence of the intrinsic velocity dispersion .",
    "with the goal of resolving the uncertainty in the m84 black hole mass , we have re - analyzed multi - slit archival _ hst _ stis observations of the nuclear region of m84 .",
    "we mapped out the 2-dimensional [ ] @xmath38 emission - line velocity , velocity dispersion , and flux .",
    "we then modeled the velocity field as a cold , thin disk in circular rotation .",
    "the line widths predicted by this model are smaller than the observed line widths , and we found that an intrinsic velocity dispersion is needed in order to match the observations .",
    "the additional velocity dispersion may have a dynamical origin and provide pressure support to the gaseous disk , thus we calculated a second disk model with an asymmetric drift correction .",
    "we found that the disk model with an asymmetric drift correction is a better fit to the data than the cold thin - disk model .",
    "this model gives a black hole mass of @xmath168 ( 1@xmath37 uncertainties ) .",
    "we have employed a more rigorous and comprehensive gas - dynamical model to measure the black hole mass in m84 than the previous two studies .",
    "in addition to calculating an asymmetric drift correction , we included a more sophisticated treatment of the effects of the telescope optics and interpreted the complex nuclear spectra as arising from a single gas component .",
    "we also performed an error analysis that encompasses a number of sources of uncertainty in order to determine the range of possible black hole masses .",
    "our new mass measurement for m84 is a factor of @xmath4 smaller than the @xcite value of @xmath186 and a factor of @xmath4 larger than the @xcite estimate of @xmath1 .",
    "the black hole mass given by @xcite is often used in the @xmath5 and @xmath187 relationships .",
    "therefore , while recent stellar - dynamical work has found that several masses at the high - end of the black hole mass - host galaxy relationships have been underestimated by a factor of @xmath4 , we find that the gas - dynamical black hole mass measurement for m84 has been overestimated by a factor of @xmath4 . with this adjustment to the black hole mass , m84 lies closer to the mass expected from both the @xmath188 and @xmath189 relationships .",
    "future work should thus aim to understand the systematics associated with each of the main mass measurement methods , and to re - examine those objects for which uncertain mass measurements remain .",
