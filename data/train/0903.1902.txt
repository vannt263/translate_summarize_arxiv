    "historically , the pairing structures played a very important role in fermion systems .",
    "the most famous example is the cooper - pair in superconductivity . @xcite",
    "one more example is the pairing of the valence nucleons in nuclei as described by the `` interacting boson model '' @xcite .",
    "however , there is no obvious evidence to support the existence of paring structures in boson systems . nonetheless , we can not rule out the possibility .",
    "for an example , each @xmath0cr atom has a spin @xmath1 .",
    "the s - wave scattering lengths @xmath2 of these atoms depend on the spin - channels @xmath3 , namely , the total spin of the two interacting atoms . there are four channels , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . accordingly , for low energy scattering , the interaction between the @xmath6 and @xmath7  atoms can be written as @xmath8where the strength @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the mass of atom .",
    "@xmath11  is the projection operator of the @xmath12channel .",
    "let @xmath13  be the spin - state of @xmath6 , @xmath14 be the normalized total spin - state of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the spins are coupled to @xmath3 and @xmath15  ( the z - component of @xmath3 ) via the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "then , @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath0cr , it has been determined experimentally that @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while @xmath20 is undetermined.@xcite since @xmath21 and @xmath22  are strongly repulsive , the atoms in low - lying states would do their best to avoid forming @xmath23  and 6 pairs .",
    "although @xmath24  is attractive , it is weak . therefore , if @xmath25  is also attractive and strong , the low - lying states might be dominated by the force of the @xmath26 channel ( the pairing force ) to form @xmath26  pairs .",
    "therefore , in view of having so many different kinds of boson systems ( the constituent may be an atom , a pair of fermions , an exciton , etc . ) , the assumption that some boson - systems in some cases might be dominated by pairing force is assumable .    in what follows ,",
    "we shall propose a model to study the effect of the pairing force on boson systems . in this model ,",
    "each particle has a nonzero integral spin @xmath27 , and they are interacting via pairing interaction .",
    "in general , if one can obtain analytical solutions of a hamiltonian , then these solutions are valuable because the underlying physics can be thereby better understood .",
    "besides , as an exact solution , it can be used to check the validity of various approximate methods .",
    "it turns out that the above model can be solved analytically as shown below .",
    "since the experimental realization of the condensation of atoms with nonzero spins,@xcite the study of the spinor condensates has become a hot topic due to academic interest and  their potential in application .",
    "traditionally , the mean - field theory is used to explain related phenomena . up to now",
    "this theory is successful . nonetheless , if the details of spin - spin correlation are taken into account , this theory is not sufficient due to the basic approximation inherent in the theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical method used in this paper is beyond the mean - field theory . in what follows",
    ", approximation is made only in the spatial space , while the spin - degrees of freedom of the @xmath28body system have been exactly treated .",
    "thus , the following approach would be a useful complement to the mean - field theory .",
    "the spin - spin correlation might by thereby better understood .",
    "we first consider a n - boson system , each boson has spin @xmath1 .",
    "the cases with @xmath29  will be discussed later .",
    "the bosons are confined by a potential .",
    "the interaction acting among the bosons contains a spin - independent term and a spin - dependent term .",
    "the latter is simply the pairing force , namely , @xmath30    we are only interested in the case of the low - temperature limit . at this limit",
    "all particles are condensed into the same spatial state @xmath31.@xcite in other words , the spatial state is fixed . therefore , the spatial degrees of freedom can be integrated .",
    "after the integration , the hamiltonian of the model reads @xmath32where @xmath33 for this hamiltonian , only the spin - degrees of freedom are considered . obviously , @xmath34 depends on the potential of confinement and on the interaction . however , since @xmath35 will be considered as a parameter , the details of the potential and the spin - independent interaction is irrelevant .  in what follows , @xmath25 ( and therefore @xmath35 )",
    "is first considered to be negative .    for the diagonalization of @xmath36",
    ", we introduce the set of symmetrized and normalized fock - states @xmath37 as basis functions , where @xmath38  is the number of atoms with spin component @xmath39 , and @xmath40  denotes the set @xmath41 which together determine the basis function .",
    "obviously , @xmath42 the total number of particles .",
    "since only the spin - degrees of freedom are involved in @xmath43 the set of fock - states is complete .",
    "the related matrix elements read @xmath44 \\label{eq:04}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath45 . for the label @xmath46",
    ", the superscript implies a revised set of the set @xmath47 by reducing both @xmath48 and @xmath49 by 1 , the subscript implies a revised set of @xmath50 by reducing @xmath51 by 2 .",
    "when the two revised sets are one - to - one identical , the label is 1 , otherwise it is zero . and so on .",
    "when @xmath52  is given , the dimension of the matrix is finite . due to the special structure of the matrix ,",
    "it can be analytically diagonalized .",
    "the results are the follows .    for convenience , @xmath52",
    "is assumed to be even unless specified .",
    "the ground state @xmath53 has an analytical form as @xmath54where @xmath51  should be even .",
    "on the other hand , we define @xmath55where @xmath56 implies a summation over all the @xmath57 permutations of particles , and the implication of @xmath58 has been given in the previous section .",
    "this state can be expanded in terms of the fock - states as @xmath59hence , @xmath60 is just the ground state that we have obtained from the diagonalization .",
    "thus the structure of the ground state is clear , it is just a product of the @xmath26 pairs , i.e. , a pairing structure .",
    "we use @xmath61  as the unit of energy in the follows , then the ground state energy turns out to be @xmath62 .    if @xmath52  is odd , the ground state would be just the above pairing structure together with an additional particle , and @xmath63 .",
    "it is reminded that the interaction keeps the total spin @xmath64  and its z - component @xmath10  to be conserved .",
    "obviously , due to the pairing structure , the ground state has @xmath65 .",
    "the first excited level is found to contain the eigen - states having @xmath66 2 , 4 , and 6 .",
    "they are exactly degenerate .",
    "their analytical forms read @xmath67where the script @xmath68 implies that the state is a yrast state , and the clebsch - gordan coefficients have been introduced , and @xmath69 \\label{eq:11}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath70 and @xmath38 are related as @xmath71 ( @xmath39  is from -3 to 3 ) and @xmath72 should be even .    similarly , we define an excited pairing structure by changing a @xmath26  pair to a @xmath73 pair .",
    "we found @xmath74thus , it is clear that the @xmath75 states have just the excited pairing structures .",
    "they all have the same eigenenergy @xmath76 disregarding @xmath64 and @xmath77 and the gap is just 1 ( in @xmath61 , @xcite ) .    in general , the spectrum of this @xmath28body system contains a finite number of levels , each is highly degenerate ( except the lowest one ) .",
    "we introduce a quantum number @xmath78  to denote the levels , therefore @xmath78  describes the degree of excitation .",
    "each eigenenergy is a sum of two terms , it reads @xmath79where @xmath80 depends roughly on the number of pairs ( @xmath81 ) and is the same for all the eigen - states , while @xmath82 depends on @xmath78 , @xmath83 ( if @xmath84 is even , in this case the first excited level has @xmath85  and therefore @xmath86 ) , or @xmath87 ( if @xmath52 is odd ) .",
    "so , when @xmath52 is even ( odd ) , totally there are @xmath88  ( ( @xmath52 + 1)/2 ) energy levels .",
    "when @xmath78 is larger , the level will be not only higher , but also have a larger degeneracy as shown later .",
    "when we compare the spectra of two systems distinct in @xmath77  their @xmath89 are one - to - one identical ( except the range of @xmath78 ) .",
    "thus , although the spectrum of the one with more particles would contain more levels , the lower parts of their spectra are exactly the same except the shift caused by @xmath90 .",
    "this is a noticeable point .",
    "the spacing of adjacent levels is just @xmath91 .",
    "thus , when @xmath78  goes up , the spacing becomes larger and larger .",
    "note that , since the set of fock - states is complete , the above spectrum is exact for the model hamiltonian .",
    "for all the states of the i - level , @xmath78 atoms would be excited from the @xmath26 pairs .",
    "therefore , @xmath78 has a similar implication as the seniority which has been introduced for describing the excitation of pairing structures of fermion systems long ago.@xcite furthermore , the maximum @xmath64  of the states belonging to an i - level is obvious @xmath92 contributed by the @xmath93 excited atoms .",
    "in general , the eigen - states can be classified according to @xmath64 , @xmath10 , and @xmath78 .",
    "it is possible that there are more than one states having the same set @xmath94 ( e.g. , for the @xmath95 level , there are two independent @xmath96 states ) . in this case",
    "an extra quantum number is necessary .",
    "therefore , an eigenstate can be labeled as @xmath97 , where @xmath6  denotes other good quantum numbers , if necessary . for examples ,",
    "the above three yrast states @xmath75  have @xmath85 , therefore they can also be denoted as @xmath98 .",
    "the degeneracy of an i - level is stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath99  be a set of seven non - negative integers ( @xmath39 is from -3 to 3 ) .",
    "there would be a finite number of sets satisfy both @xmath100 and @xmath101 . the number of these sets is denoted by @xmath102 .",
    "then , one can prove that the degeneracy of the i - th level @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this number increases very fast with @xmath105 , e.g. , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "note that the degeneracy caused by @xmath10 has not yet been taken into account .    for higher excitation",
    ", a stste from the @xmath95 level is given as an example as @xmath109_{0}(56)_{0}% \\cdots \\}-\\sqrt{5}\\boldsymbol{p}\\{[(12)_{4}(34)_{4}]_{0}(56)_{0}\\cdots \\ } ) \\label{eq:14}\\]]where",
    "four particles are excited from the @xmath26 pairs .",
    "the structures of higher states will become more and more complicated because more particles are excited .",
    "we are not going to the details of them .",
    "when @xmath35 is positive , the above analytical solutions hold exactly .",
    "however , the spectrum would be reversed .",
    "the ground states would be highly degenerate , all of them belong to the @xmath110 level , wherein all @xmath26 pairs are rejected . in particular , there is a great energy gap @xmath111 .",
    "a larger @xmath52  leads to a larger gap .",
    "thus , when @xmath52  is large , the spin - degrees of freedom of the group of ground states are difficult to be excited .",
    "this is also a noticeable point .",
    "when @xmath29 , one can also use the fock - states as basis functions .",
    "after the diagonalization , the eigenenergies are also a sum of two terms , namely , @xmath112 .",
    "however , @xmath113 , while @xmath114 .",
    "the eigenstates have the same structures as before , and therefore can also be classified as @xmath115",
    ". in particular , the @xmath116 level has all particles in @xmath26  pairs , while the @xmath85  level has two particles excited from the @xmath26 pairs , and so on .",
    "we go back again to the cases with @xmath1  and an even @xmath52 and a negative @xmath117 .",
    "when a magnetic field @xmath118 lying along the z - axis is applied , the model hamiltonian reads ( in @xmath61 ) @xmath119where @xmath120 is the operator of the total spin along the z - axis , @xmath121 , @xmath122 is the bohr magneton ( incidentally , if the atom is @xmath0cr with @xmath1 , @xmath123 ) .",
    "the eigen - states of @xmath124 are exactly the same as @xmath36 , however the eigen - energies would contain an additional term due to the stern - gerlach splitting as @xmath125    we are interested in how the structure of the ground state would vary with @xmath126 . for the group of states belonging to the @xmath127level , the largest @xmath10 possessed by these states is@xmath128 .",
    "thus the state with @xmath129  of each @xmath130level is a candidate of the ground state with the energy @xmath131 .  among the candidates , when @xmath118  ( or @xmath132 ) is fixed ,",
    "if @xmath133 leads to the minimum of the group @xmath134 ,  then the ground state would have @xmath133 .",
    "obviously , @xmath135 depends on @xmath118 .",
    "it was found that , when @xmath118  is small so that @xmath136 , the ground state has @xmath137 . starting from 7/42 ,",
    "let the range of @xmath132be divided into segments , each has a length 2/21 .",
    "then , when @xmath132increases , @xmath135 will increase step by step from a segment to the next segment .",
    "each step @xmath135 will jump by 2 .",
    "the general relation of @xmath135and @xmath132 is : @xmath138    since @xmath135 can not exceed @xmath52 , the last segment is @xmath139  in this extensive segment , @xmath140 , namely , the increase of the magnetic field will eventually excite all particles from the @xmath26 pairs .    in each segment the associated ground state energy @xmath141 , and @xmath142 within the segment . when @xmath132  increases , since @xmath135 will increase step by step , the slope becomes more and more negative .    when @xmath143 we have approximately @xmath144 .",
    "thus we have @xmath145 it implies that , when @xmath132 increases , the decline of @xmath146 against @xmath132  is nearly parabolic .",
    "of course , when @xmath147 the decline is only contributed by the last term of eq.(16 ) , i.e. , @xmath148 , and therefore is linear .",
    "the analytical form of the wave function of the ground state can also be obtained .",
    "it reads in terms of the fock - states as ( not yet normalized ) @xmath149(i_{o}+1,i_{o}+2)_{0}\\cdots ( n-1,n)_{0}\\}\\ .",
    "\\label{eq:18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , when a magnetic field is applied , the ground state would have a portion of particles excited and become fully polarized , while the others remain in the @xmath26 pairs .",
    "thus the implication of @xmath135  is clear , it is just the number of polarized particles .    from @xmath150",
    "it is straight forward to calculate the probability of a particle in @xmath151component @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the operator of the number of particles in @xmath154 and @xmath155 . obviously ,",
    "if @xmath156  ( or @xmath157 ) while the other @xmath158 , the system is fully polarized",
    ". therefore , from @xmath159 one can understand the situation of magnetization of a state . for @xmath150 , from ( 18 )",
    "we have @xmath160    examples of @xmath159  against @xmath132  are given in fig.1 .",
    "when @xmath161 , all @xmath162 in this case all particles are in @xmath26 pairs .",
    "accordingly , the total spin - state has @xmath65 and therefore is isotropic .",
    "when @xmath132 increases , the variation of @xmath159 can be roughly divided into three stages . in the first stage",
    "both @xmath163 and @xmath164 increases very fast while the other @xmath159 decreases very fast as shown in the figure . when @xmath165 @xmath166 are found to be equal to @xmath167 .",
    "we use the range 0 to @xmath168 to define the first stage .",
    "the second stage is from @xmath168 to @xmath169 ( say , when @xmath170 , @xmath1712.2 and @xmath172 476.3 as shown in fig.1c and 1b ) . in this stage @xmath163  increases ( @xmath164 decreases )",
    "nearly linearly until equal to 1 ( 0 ) , while the other @xmath159 remain @xmath173 .",
    "the third stage ( @xmath174 ) is characterized by @xmath156 , i.e. , the system is fully polarized .    incidentally ,",
    "the structure of the ground states of the @xmath0cr condensates under a magnetic field has already been studied by a number of authors using the mean field theory.@xcite obviously , the spinors from the mean field theory can be compared with @xmath175 . when @xmath25  is very negative , two phases `` polar '' and `` ferromagnetic '' have been found .",
    "the associated spinors are ( @xmath176 and ( 1,0,0,0,0,0,0 ) , respectively .",
    "obviously , the former ( latter ) corresponds to the above second ( third ) stage of @xmath159 . from the correspondence",
    "we know that the underlying physics of the `` polar phase '' is just a kind of structure wherein a portion of particles are fully polarized while all other particles are in @xmath26 pairs .    using the concept of the fractional parentage coefficients one can extract any pair of particles , say @xmath6 and @xmath7 , from a spin - state @xmath177  as @xmath178   \\label{eq:20}\\end{aligned}\\]]where the two fock - states written explicitly at the right are for @xmath179-body systems .",
    "the former originates from @xmath180 by changing @xmath181 to @xmath182 while the latter by changing both @xmath38 and @xmath183  to @xmath184 and @xmath185 respectively . from this expansion",
    "it is straight forward to calculate how the magnetization @xmath15 of a selected pair would be .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath186 denote the spin - components of the two selected atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath187 .",
    "then , the probability of the pair in @xmath15  reads @xmath188\\ .",
    "\\label{eq:21}\\ ] ]    in addition to @xmath159 , @xmath189 is a measure of spin - correlation ( corresponding to the two - body correlation function in spatial space ) , and has no counterpart in mean field theory .",
    "@xmath189 of the ground states of @xmath124 against @xmath132  are plotted in fig.2 . among all the thirteen @xmath189",
    "( @xmath15 is from -6 to 6 ) , @xmath190 is much larger than the others if @xmath191 ( in this case all particles are in @xmath26 pairs ) .",
    "thus , for every pair of particles , the probability of having their spins anti - parallel is the largest .",
    "the next largest is the group @xmath192 , while the smallest is the group @xmath193 .",
    "however , when @xmath132  increases , @xmath194 will increase nearly linearly . @xmath190 and",
    "@xmath195 increase firstly with @xmath196  but eventually decrease with @xmath132 as plotted .",
    "other @xmath189 are very small .  when @xmath174 , @xmath197 implying a full polarization as expected .",
    "a model is proposed to study the possible pairing structures of n - boson systems with nonzero spin .",
    "analytical solutions have been obtained .",
    "the following points are mentioned    when the pairing force is negative , the ground state has all particles forming the @xmath26 pairs .",
    "the excited states are described by good quantum numbers @xmath198 and @xmath78 .",
    "the latter is just the number of particles not in the @xmath26 pairs .",
    "the state has a larger @xmath78 is higher , and the states have the same @xmath78 are degenerate .",
    "when a magnetic field @xmath118 is applied , the ground state will have a portion of particles fully polarized , while the other particles remain in the @xmath26 pairs .",
    "when the pairing force is positive , the ground state is highly degenerate with a gap proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath52  is large , the spin - degrees of freedom are difficult to be excited .    two quantities @xmath159 and @xmath189 have been defined and studied .",
    "they are the spin - space analogues of the one- and two - body densities of coordinate space .",
    "in particular , @xmath189 can help us to understand better the spin - correlation and has no counterpart in mean field theory .",
    "therefore , these quantities are in general useful for understanding the spin - structures of various systems . for an example , the underlying structure of the `` polar phase '' found in @xcite is thereby clarified as a mixture of fully polarized particles and @xmath26  pairs .                in the theory of condensates based on the mean field theory ,",
    "@xmath199 depends on @xmath39 , the z - component of the spin of an atom .",
    "when the dependence is omitted , it is called the single mode approximation ( sma ) .",
    "this approximation would be valid if the particle density is dilute , the temperature is very low , and the spin - dependent interaction is weak .",
    "this is just the case of most condensates in general .",
    "therefore , the sma is a good approximation and has been widely used in the literatures of condensates . in this paper the sma",
    "is used also .",
    "although the energy gap of the ground state does not depend on @xmath52  if @xmath61 is used as a unit , since @xmath200 is roughly proportional to @xmath201 , @xmath61 decreases slowly with the increase of @xmath52 .",
    "thus a larger @xmath52  would actually lead to a smaller gap when the pairing force is attractive ."
