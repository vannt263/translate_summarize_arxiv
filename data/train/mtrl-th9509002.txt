    "in the past few years , theoretical and algorithmic advances have made it possible to determine the thermodynamical properties of solids ( such as specific heat or thermal - expansion coefficient ) from first principles calculations @xcite .",
    "silicon is a choice system for testing these methods , since accurate measurements on high - purity samples exist over a wide range of temperature .",
    "moreover , it presents a negative thermal - expansion coefficient between 20  k and 120  k which is of fundamental interest .",
    "this unusual thermal - expansion behavior can be attributed to the negative grneisen parameters ( i.e. , phonon frequency increases as crystal volume increases ) of the transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonons near the brillouin - zone boundary .",
    "it is interesting to note that this anomalous behaviour also affects other properties of silicon , such as the mean square atomic displacement ( as shown later in this paper ) .",
    "this anomalous negative thermal expansion has been analyzed in previous studies , most of them relying on the quasiharmonic approximation @xcite . in this approach , the volume dependence of phonon frequencies must be determined .",
    "kagaya , shuoji , and soma @xcite used a perturbation treatment with a model pseudopotential to calculate the specific heat and the thermal - expansion coefficient .",
    "biernacki and scheffler @xcite employed a keating model with two parameters , which were extracted from local - density pseudopotential calculations , to compute the thermal - expansion coefficient .",
    "fleszar and gonze @xcite performed a model - free computation of the thermal expansion , using a linear - response technique within dft @xcite .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a tight - binding model to calculate the thermal - expansion coefficient and mode grneisen parameters ; they also showed by using a simple model that the negative values of the mode grneisen parameter could be attributed to a larger contribution from the central part of forces than the angular part of forces .",
    "more recently , wei , li , and chou @xcite extracted interatomic force constants from _ ab initio _ calculations of planar forces @xcite , and calculated the specific heat , the overall grneisen parameter , and the thermal - expansion coefficient .    in this paper",
    ", we use a variational approach to density - functional perturbation theory to calculate volume - dependent dynamical properties of silicon ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : dyn - prop ] ) .",
    "we present first an _ ab initio _ study of the volume dependence of interatomic force constants up to twenty - fifth nearest neighbors .",
    "wei and chou had also presented such a calculation but only for one volume and up to eighth nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "phonon frequencies of ta(@xmath0 ) and ta(@xmath1 ) modes , and of the associated mode grneisen parameters are also calculated for different volumes .",
    "the influence of successive nearest neighbors shells is analysed .",
    "we confirm that the contribution of atoms connected by zig - zag chain along [ 1  1  0 ] direction are the most important , as suggested by mazur and pollmann @xcite .",
    "but we show that the contributions of fifth , sixth , and seventh atoms along the chain ( respectively thirteenth , eightenth and twenty - fifth nearest neighbors ) are not negligible contrarily to what had been speculated by wei and chou @xcite .",
    "analytical formulas , taking into account interactions up to second nearest neighbors , are developped for phonon frequencies of ta(@xmath0 ) and ta(@xmath1 ) modes and the corresponding mode grneisen parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thm - prop ] , we analyze the volume and pressure dependence of various thermodynamic properties ( specific heat , bulk modulus , thermal expansion ) .",
    "the effect of zero - point motion on static equilibrium properties ( lattice constant and bulk modulus ) also analyzed .",
    "we point out the effect of the negative mode grneisen parameters of the acoustic branches on these properties . in sec .",
    "[ sec : atom - fact ] , we present the evolution of the mean square atomic displacement and of the atomic temperature factor with the temperature for different volumes .",
    "anomalous effects present at all temperature are investigated , using a band - by - band decomposition .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in the last section .",
    "to obtain accurate interatomic force constants ( ifc s ) , we first calculate from first principles the dynamical matrices for 10 different wavevectors in the irreducible brillouin zone ( ibz ) ( the special points mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite ) using a variational approach to density - functional perturbation theory then , we perform a fourier transform of these dynamical matrices in order to get the ifc s , following ref .",
    "this sampling of dynamical matrices allows to obtain ifc s in a real space box containing 512 atoms .",
    "this is more accurate than what had been done in ref .",
    "@xcite where the ifc s had only been calculated for 2 different wavectors in the ibz which corresponds to a real space box of 64 atoms .",
    "it is also better than the work of wei and chou @xcite who had included interatomic interactions up to eighth nearest neighbors , which corresponds to 99 atoms .    our calculations , performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , use a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm @xcite .",
    "we use a rational polynomial parametrization of the exchange - correlation energy functional @xcite , which is based on the ceperley - alder gas data @xcite .",
    "the electronic wavefunctions are sampled on a mesh of 10 special @xmath2 points in the ibz and expanded in terms of a set of plane - waves whose kinetic energy is limited to 10 hartree .",
    "the `` all - electron '' potentials are replaced by an _ ab initio _ ,",
    "separable , norm - conserving pseudopotential built following the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "the calculated equilibrium lattice constant is 10.18 bohr  @xcite ( the influence of the zero - point motion on this value will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : thm - prop ] ) , whereas the experimental one is 10.26 bohr .",
    "the calculation of ifc s is performed for three different volumes , corresponding to lattice constants @xmath3 of 10.00 , 10.18 , and 10.26 bohr respectively .",
    "the ifc s for these different lattice constants are listed in table  [ tab : ifc ] , in which coordinates are in units of @xmath4 and notations for the force constants follow ref .",
    "@xcite .    as already noticed in refs .",
    "@xcite , ifc s for atoms connected by zig - zag chain along [ 1  1  0 ] direction ( or the directions related to it by symmetry ) are the most important .",
    "the magnitude of ifc s along these peculiar directions decays quite slowly .",
    "the contribution of the first nearest neighbors ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) is about 4 to 5 times smaller than on - site contribution ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "going up to second nearest neighbours reduces the ifc s by another factor of 5 ( @xmath8 ) or 10 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "the contribution @xmath11 of the seventh atoms along the chain ( coordinates ( 7,7,1 ) in units of @xmath4 ) , which are already the twenty - fifth nearest neighbors , is still of the order of 1 percent of the contribution of the first nearest neighbors , and of 5 percent of that of the second ones .",
    "comparatively , the biggest contribution of the seventh nearest neighbors ( these do not belong to the chain , but are twice closer than the seventh atoms along the chain ) is about 2 times smaller .    in order to vizualize these ifc s , we compute the forces induced along the zig - zag chain by the displacement of a generic atom of this chain in three perpendicular directions ( along [ 1  1  0 ]  parallel to the chain direction , along [ 0  0  1 ]  perpendicular to the chain direction , but in the plane of the chain , and along [ 1  @xmath12  0 ]  perpendicular to the chain direction , but out of the plane of the chain ) , all the other atoms being kept fixed .",
    "these forces can easily be obtained from ifc s by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the displacement of the generic atom , and the ifc @xmath15 is the force exerted on ion @xmath16 in the direction @xmath17 due to the displacement of ion @xmath18 in the direction @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting forces have been reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] .",
    "the directions of the forces induced by the displacement of the generic atom in the [ 1  1  0 ] , and [ 0  0  1 ] directions show that the bonds along the chain will tend to bend in order to keep constant the bond angles : at sufficient distance , the forces are nearly perpendicular to the last connecting bond .",
    "the decay of the magnitude of these forces along the chain is similar to that of the ifc s . at the contrary , the forces induced by the displacement in the [ 1  @xmath12  0 ] direction are much more smaller .",
    "indeed , they have the generic form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are of the same order of magnitude ( see table  [ tab : ifc ] ) .",
    "it is thus more difficult to interpret them .      in previous studies , the negative mode",
    "grneisen parameters associated with the modes of the acoustic branches , near the zone boundaries , has been shown to drive the negative thermal expansion .",
    "we now focus on the analysis of the high symmetry ta(@xmath0 ) and ta(@xmath1 ) modes because analytical results can be obtained for them .",
    "the phonon frequencies can be calculated by solving the dynamical equation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the displacement in the direction @xmath17 of ion @xmath16 for the normal mode @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the mass of ion @xmath16 , and @xmath27 is the frequency of the normal mode @xmath25 .    in order to analyse the influence of the successive nearest neighbors shells for ta(@xmath0 ) and ta(@xmath1 ) modes , we artificially limit the interactions taken into account in the ifc matrix @xmath15 to the atoms whose distance is less than a cut - off radius .",
    "then , we increase the cut - off radius shell by shell until the sphere contains all the atoms included in the real space box defined by our sampling of the brillouin zone .",
    "in truncating the interaction to different shells , we break the acoustic sum rule ( which states that moving all atoms as whole should not create any force ) unless it is reimposed by artificially changing the on - site ifc @xmath7 .",
    "we analyzed both the results obtained with and without reimposing the acoustic sum rule and found no significative difference regarding the convergence with respect to the number of nearest neighbors shells included .",
    "thus , in the following , we will only reproduce the results obtained without reimposing the acoustic sum rule .",
    "the results are reproduced in tables  [ tab : phonx ] and [ tab : phonl ] .",
    "the well - converged calculated frequencies of ta(@xmath0 ) and ta(@xmath1 ) modes are respectively 140.46  @xmath28 and 108.626  @xmath28 at the calculated equilibrium lattice constant , 147.37  @xmath28 and 112.86  @xmath28 at the experimental one .",
    "these values are in very good agreement with experiment @xcite : 149.77  @xmath28 and 114.41  @xmath28 .",
    "the associated mode grneisen parameters are calculated by : @xmath29 where @xmath25 is the index of the mode , and @xmath30 is the molar volume ( @xmath31 @xmath32 volume of the unit cell ) , linked to the lattice constant by : @xmath33 the results , reproduced in tables  [ tab : phonx ] and [ tab : phonl ] , are very sensitive to the volume variations .",
    "the calculated mode grneisen parameters of ta(@xmath0 ) and ta(@xmath1 ) modes are respectively -2.295 and -1.814 at the calculated equilibrium lattice constant",
    ". these values are not in very good agreement with experiment @xcite : -1.4 and -1.3 . however ,",
    "if we consider the values -1.782 and -1.451 obtained at the experimental equilibrium lattice constant , the agreement is much better .    considering for reference the values obtained by taking into account all the atoms included in the real space box , we see that the contribution of atoms connected by zig - zag chain along [ 1  1  0 ] direction are the most important for the convergence of the phonon frequencies of ta(@xmath0 ) and ta(@xmath1 ) modes , and of the associated mode grneisen parameters . beyond the fourth atom along the [ 1  1  0 ] chain ( eighth nearest neighbors ) , the contribution of successive nearest neighbors not belonging to the chains is not significant .",
    "but the contributions of fifth , sixth , and seventh atoms along the chain ( respectively thirteenth , eightenth and twenty - fifth nearest neighbors ) are not negligible , contrarily to what had been speculated by wei and chou @xcite . including still",
    "further atoms along the chains would necessitate to use another sampling of the dynamical matrix wavevectors in order to get a bigger real space box . tables  [ tab : phonx ] and [ tab : phonl ] also show that , once interactions with the first nearest neighbors are included , the anomalous behaviour of ta modes at @xmath0 and @xmath1 points ( negative grneisen parameters ) are reproduced .",
    "this reinforce the pertinence of the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for ta(@xmath0 ) and ta(@xmath1 ) modes , the eigenmodes @xmath24 are known for any ion from symmetry considerations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : displace ] ) .",
    "it is thus even possible to obtain an analytical expression of phonon frequencies , from the knowledge of the ifc s .",
    "if we only consider on - site interaction ( just atom @xmath16 ) in the sum of the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamical ] ) , we get : @xmath34 for both ta(@xmath0 ) and ta(l ) modes , where @xmath35 is the mass of silicon ion .",
    "the associated mode grneisen parameters can easily be obtained by inserting this result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gruneisen ] ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the `` force grneisen parameter '' , that we define as : @xmath38 the force grneisen parameters have been listed in table  [ tab : ifc ] for for all ifc s whose magnitude is higher than @xmath39 hartree / bohr@xmath40 .",
    "if we consider interactions up to first nearest neighbors atoms , we get : @xmath41 for ta(@xmath0 ) mode , and @xmath42 for ta(l ) mode .",
    "whatever the number of nearest neighbors taken into account , the phonon frequencies will always be written as the square root of the ratio of a linear combination of the ifc s and the mass .",
    "the associated mode grneisen parameters can be written as _",
    "weighted sum _ of the force grneisen parameters corresponding to the ifc s under the root in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phon1x ] ) and ( [ eq : phon1l ] )  . for example , for the ta(@xmath0 )",
    "mode , inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : phon1x ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gruneisen ] ) , we get : @xmath43 this can be rewritten as follows : @xmath44 the definition of force grneisen parameters , eq .",
    "( [ eq : force - grun ] ) , leads to @xmath45 for ta(@xmath0 ) mode , and @xmath46 for ta(l ) mode .",
    "interestingly the same argument holds , whatever the number of nearest neighbors taken into account . and",
    "thus , the same kind of formulas will be obtained for phonon frequencies and associated mode grneisen parameters .",
    "indeed , if we consider interactions up to second nearest neighbors atoms , we get : @xmath47 for ta(@xmath0 ) mode , and @xmath48 for ta(l ) mode .",
    "the associated mode grneisen parameters can be written as weighted sum of the force grneisen parameters corresponding to the ifc s under the root in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phon2x ] ) and ( [ eq : phon2l ] ) : @xmath49 for ta(@xmath0 ) mode , and @xmath50 for ta(l ) mode .",
    "it should be noted that the weights in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gruneisen1x ] ) to ( [ eq : phon2l ] ) are not necessarily included in the interval [ 0,1 ] and can thus be negative .",
    "this explains why , though almost all force grneisen parameters are positive ( see table  [ tab : ifc ] ) , a negative mode grneisen parameter can be obtained .",
    "for example , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gruneisen1x ] ) , we get for @xmath3=10.18 bohr : @xmath51 which is just what is obtained in table  [ tab : phonx ] .",
    "if all force grneisen parameters were equal to 1 , we would also get 1 for the mode grneisen parameter .",
    "this shows that the origin of the negative grneisen parameter is the rather important difference between @xmath52 and @xmath37 .",
    "using the calculated phonon frequencies , the temperature - dependent phonon contribution @xmath53 to the helmholtz free energy @xmath54 is calculated as described in ref .",
    "this contribution is added to the energy of the static lattice @xmath55 , calculated previously @xcite , to get @xmath54 for a set of three volumes and for various temperatures . this function",
    "is then interpolated as a function of @xmath30 by a second order fit .",
    "the equilibrium volumes ( or lattice constants ) at various temperatures are determined by minimizing @xmath54 as a function of @xmath30 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : minf ] . from @xmath54 any other thermodynamical property can be accessed .",
    "we first analyze briefly the specific effect of the zero - point motion .",
    "we find that the zero - point contribution to helmholtz free energy f is @xmath56=12  j / mol , which is about 2.5% of the cohesive energy ( 460  kj / mol @xcite ) .",
    "this zero - point contribution causes the lattice constant to be shifted from 10.1894  bohr to 10.1974  bohr , which is a change smaller than 0.1  % , and the bulk modulus @xmath57 from 1.0387  mbar to 1.0292  mbar , which is a change of 1  % .",
    "note however that the change in the bulk modulus includes two effects : first , it is linked to the second derivative of @xmath58 that includes the zero - point motion contribution @xmath56 ; and second , it is calculated for a different volume due to the shift of the lattice constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bt ] , we present the temperature dependence of @xmath57 for different pressures",
    ".    the entropy can be calculated following ref .",
    "we get @xmath59(298.15  k)=19.3  j  k@xmath60  mol@xmath60 , to be compared to the experimental value of 18.81  j  k@xmath60  mol@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated the variation of enthalpy @xmath61 between 0 and 298.15  k. we get 3.285  j  mol@xmath60 whereas the experimental value is 3.217  j  mol@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpm ] the molar constant - pressure specific heat @xmath62 for various pressures .",
    "this result agrees quite well with experimental work @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for temperature higher than 85  k , @xmath62 is higher for low values of the pressure . whereas , for temperature lower than 85  k , it is just the contrary .",
    "this means that there exists a temperature around 85  k for which @xmath62 is independent of pressure . in order to understand this observation",
    ", we use the following relation ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath63 to write : @xmath64 this shows that in order to have @xmath62 independent of pressure , one must have a decreasing @xmath65 .",
    "this is precisely the case of silicon between 20  k and 100  k , where the thermal - expansion coefficient gets more and more negative .",
    "this thermal - expansion coefficient is well reproduced by our calculations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alpha ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that increasing the pressure reinforces the anomalous negative behaviour of this property .",
    "this is confirmed by the strong negative value of the overall grneisen parameter at high pressure ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gamma ] ) .",
    "this anomalous behaviour has also consequences on other properties .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpm - cvm ] , the difference @xmath66 between the molar constant - pressure specific heat @xmath62 and the molar constant - volume specific heat @xmath67 for various pressures . at high temperature @xmath66 increases with increasing pressure , while at low temperature , it is the contrary and the curve presents a bump .",
    "this is can be deduced from the following relation @xcite : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , the difference @xmath70 between @xmath71 the bulk modulus calculated from @xmath72 at constant entropy and @xmath57 the bulk modulus calculated from @xmath72 at constant temperature presents the same behaviour as @xmath66 as shown in fig.[fig : bs - bt ] .",
    "indeed , we can write @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "at finite temperature @xmath75 , the intensity of x - ray diffraction from the crystal is reduced , due to atomic motion . the atomic temperature factor",
    "@xmath76 characterizes the oscillations of atom @xmath16 around its equilibrium position .",
    "it is defined @xcite by : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the component of scattering wavevector * g * which is a reciprocal lattice vector , and @xmath79 is the mean square atomic displacement @xcite of atom @xmath16 along the directions @xmath17 and @xmath19 : @xmath80 where @xmath26 is the mass of atom @xmath16 , and @xmath81 is the @xmath82th component of the eigenvector associated with the mode l at @xmath83 in the lattice coordinates .    in the case of silicon , there is only one kind of atom .",
    "thus , for all atoms @xmath76 are identical .",
    "the reduction of the diffusion intensity is given by @xmath84 , which is usually called the debye - waller factor .",
    "the symmetry of the diamond structure imposes that : @xmath85 ( this @xmath86 is not to be confused with the bulk modulus . )    in table  [ tab : thm - fact ] , the results obtained for the mean square atomic displacement , at three different volumes , corresponding to lattice constants @xmath3 of 10.00 , 10.18 , and 10.26 bohr respectively , are compared with experimental results .",
    "the agreement is on the order of a few percent .",
    "interestingly , even at room temperature , the mean square atomic displacement decreases with increasing volume , contrary to the intuition .",
    "this can easily be understood from the definition of @xmath86 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : thm - fact ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is written as a sum over all phonon bands of a term which is proportional to the inverse square of the frequency of the mode @xmath87 ( since @xmath88 for small @xmath89 ) .",
    "thus , it is determined mostly by acoustic branches .",
    "this is confirmed by a band - by - band decomposition of @xmath86 ( see table  [ tab : thm - fact ] ) where the two lowest bands account for more than @xmath90 of @xmath86 . as the ta band and the first la band exhibit a negative mode grneisen parameter",
