    "it is found from this expression that the experimentally favored neutrino matrix is restricted to a special form in which the matrix elements are integer ( inter - family related ) valued .",
    "such a suggestive form seems to indicate a hidden structure in nature beyond the sm , and a number of proposals to unravel it have been elaborated  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "such a compatibility of large generation mixing with mass hierarchy is suitable for the extensions to the quark sector and grand unification .",
    "the cascade - form matrix implies a parameter - independent relation among the lepton mixing angles and mass eigenvalues , which would be tested in future neutrino oscillation experiments . in section  [ pheno ] , several phenomenological aspects of the cascade lepton matrices are also discussed , e.g.  the lepton flavor - violating processes , the thermal leptogenesis , and the cp violation in neutrino oscillations . in section  [ dynamics ]",

    "it is interesting here to remember the well - known relations among the quark generation mixing and the down - type quark masses @xmath29 .",
    "the experimentally observed values of quark masses and mixing angles are roughly related as @xmath30 it is found from these expressions that @xmath31 is induced from a waterfall matrix , while @xmath32 is described by a cascade matrix .",

    "we first consider the situation that the neutrino dirac mass matrix takes the cascade form : @xmath36 with the mass parameter hierarchy @xmath37 , having in mind the extension to more fundamental theory including quarks and grand unification . throughout this paper the cascade matrix",

    "this is because , as we will show , the right - handed neutrino masses are experimentally required to have larger hierarchy than the dirac masses and therefore the generation mixing ( the off - diagonal elements ) in @xmath39 becomes negligible .",
    "accordingly we are allowed to take the diagonal form of @xmath39 from the beginning .",
    "the first task is to find experimental indications on the cascade neutrino matrices , referring to the current experimental data of neutrino mass eigenvalues and mixing .",

    "such types of parameter relations have often been seen in the lepton mass models , e.g.  with the vacuum alignments and non - abelian flavor symmetry which connects different generations  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study phenomenological results of the cascade lepton matrices with as the first approximation in a suggestive form , and discuss its characteristic property in current and future particle / cosmological experiments such as for lepton flavor and cp violations . later ( in section  [ dynamics ] ) , we will present several flavor symmetry dynamics for the cascade - form matrix .",
    "the mass eigenvalues are roughly given by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",

    "these together uniquely define the unitary mixing matrix of the tri - bimaximal form .",
    "the remaining third term in has tiny generation mixing due to the mass hierarchy and only gives small corrections . in the waterfall model",
    "widely studied with @xmath51 flavor symmetry , the tri - maximal and/or bi - maximal nature seems not to be simply captured , since the steepness in every point of the stream generally requires an elaborate form of right - handed neutrino mass matrix , which might be difficult to rely on some theoretical background .",
    "as for high - energy couplings before the seesaw , the cascade hierarchy parameters are loosely bounded as @xmath52 in order for the model to be consistent with the observed generation mixing . here",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 are the mass squared differences of light neutrinos and the current experimental data  @xcite at the @xmath55 sigma level is @xmath56 then the bound means that the ratio between the two cascade falls is @xmath57 .",
    "there is no experimental upper bound on @xmath58 , and the cascade could have a mild hierarchy .",
    "as for the right - handed neutrino majorana masses , they are estimated from the experimental data of neutrino oscillations . given the normal hierarchy of light neutrino mass spectrum , the right - handed neutrino masses become @xmath59 with the best fit values of the experimental data ( and no complex phase parameters assumed ) .",
    "the first two generation masses , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are determined independently of the tri - bimaximal generation mixing .",
    "the third - generation mass @xmath62 does not have theoretical and/or experimental upper bound , and the limit @xmath63 means that the lightest eigenvalue @xmath64 vanishes and the tri - bimaximal generation mixing is achieved with a large cascade hierarchy . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath62 has a lower bound which is given by the maximal deviations of @xmath65 and @xmath66 from their best fit values , i.e.  @xmath67 gev .",
    "we thus find the right - handed neutrinos generally have the mass hierarchy @xmath68 , while the largest light neutrino mass @xmath69 is given by the @xmath61 effect .",
    "it is seen from the above discussion that there are four combinations of independent parameters while the five observed quantities exist in the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "therefore one parameter - independent relation among the observables is found ( the corrections from the charged - lepton sector will be evaluated in the next section ) . that is explicitly written down in the leading order of @xmath70 : @xmath71 where we have taken the parameters as real valued .",
    "the relation is interpreted in two ways .",
    "first , the solar neutrino angle @xmath23 has a correlation with @xmath25 .",
    "such behavior is given independently of the detail of light neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig:1213 ] represents a typical numerical calculation of @xmath23 and @xmath25 .     from the cascade matrices.,width=264 ]     from the cascade matrices.,width=264 ]    it can be seen from the figure that @xmath72 is concentrated near a thin curve implied by the relation .",
    "secondly , the relation implies that the atmospheric neutrino angle @xmath24 is near the maximal value @xmath73 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:2313 ] the numerical evaluation of the atmospheric neutrino angle . in both these figures ,",
    "the tri - bimaximal mixing is found to be realized around the central region of parameter space .",
    "finally we comment on other similar types of scenarios for neutrino masses .",
    "first , for the asymmetric form of cascade , there is a solution which makes the seesaw - induced mass matrix consistent with . in this solution ,",
    "the 3 - 2 element in the dirac mass @xmath74 is on the same order of the 3 - 3 element , like the so - called lopsided matrix  @xcite .",
    "the inverted mass hierarchy of light neutrinos is also viable for asymmetric cascades .",
    "second , the cascade form of the neutrino dirac mass matrix is known to be preferred from the viewpoint of parameter fine - tuning  @xcite .",
    "the third scenario with a different principle is the sequential dominance model  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the first law of @xmath74 is assumed to have a vanishing element to realize the tri - bimaximal generation mixing in the lepton sector .",
    "the choice of the vanishing element depends on the order of right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "the sequential dominance model has the parameter relations ( [ cond ] ) in a different basis , in other words , the mass hierarchy in @xmath39 is not necessarily sequential .",
    "as for the ( symmetric ) cascade matrix discussed in this paper , the hierarchical structure , @xmath37 , plays important roles for realizing the tri - bimaximal mixing and neutrino mass eigenvalues .",
    "further we are motivated to explore the cascade form ( [ cas ] ) for the extensions to the quark sector and also to grand unified theory which connects the matrix forms of quarks and leptons .",
    "the symmetric and hierarchical cascade also has a peculiar dynamical origin , as will be discussed in a later section [ e.g.  see ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in this paper we explore the possibility that the mass matrix of charged leptons also has the cascade form .",
    "this is motivated , for example , by a high - energy completion of the present framework with left - right gauge symmetry or a more fundamental principle such as grand unification .",
    "in this subsection , we study the corrections from the charged - lepton sector to the lepton generation mixing angles .    now",
    "the charged - lepton mass matrix takes the form : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 . unlike the neutrino sector",
    ", the magnitudes of cascade hierarchy can be evaluated from the experimentally observed values of charged - lepton masses and given by @xmath78 the generation mixing is expressed in terms of the cascade hierarchy parameters , as shown in table  .",
    "therefore the corrections from the charged - lepton sector are found to be generally small and the total lepton mixing angles are given at the first order of perturbation @xmath79    \\sin^2\\theta_{23 } & = & \\bigg|\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2 } }     + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\frac{{m_\\nu}_1(3{m_\\nu}_3      -{m_\\nu}_2)}{{m_\\nu}_3({m_\\nu}_3-{m_\\nu}_2 ) }     + \\frac{\\delta}{3\\sqrt{2}\\lambda}\\ ,    \\frac{{m_\\nu}_2}{{m_\\nu}_3-{m_\\nu}_2 }    -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\frac{m_\\mu}{m_\\tau}\\bigg|^2 ,     \\label{23 } \\\\[1 mm ]    \\sin^2\\theta_{13 } & = & \\bigg|\\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2}\\lambda}\\ ,    \\frac{{m_\\nu}_3-\\frac{2}{3}{m_\\nu}_2}{{m_\\nu}_3-{m_\\nu}_2 }    + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\,{m_\\nu}_1{m_\\nu}_2}{{m_\\nu}_3({m_\\nu}_3-{m_\\nu}_2 ) }    + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\frac{m_e}{m_\\mu}\\bigg|^2,\\end{aligned}\\]]from these expressions , one can see the effects of charged - lepton cascades .",
    "the solar neutrino mixing is little ( less than 1% ) affected and the tri - bimaximal solar angle ( @xmath80 ) still holds . as for the atmospheric neutrino mixing , in the right - handed side of eq .  , the charged - lepton effect often gives the dominant correction ( @xmath81 ) to the tri - bimaximal atmospheric angle ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "finally , the reactor neutrino mixing sometimes receives a comparable effect relative to the neutrino sector result .",
    "however its magnitude is of negligible order ( @xmath83 ) and the tri - bimaximal reactor angle ( @xmath84 ) is not modified too much by the charged - lepton sector . since the hierarchy of the charged - lepton cascade is expressed by the observables as and , a parameter - independent relation still holds including the charged - lepton correction : @xmath85 in the first order approximation .",
    "as we have shown , the cascade form of lepton mass matrices is well fitted to the observed masses and mixing angles , and in particular , yields the tri - bimaximal generation mixing from hierarchical mass matrix structure .",
    "the non - trivial generation mixing in yukawa matrices generally provides rich flavor phenomenology other than fermion masses . in this section",
    ", we investigate characteristic phenomenology induced by the cascade - form matrix : the lepton flavor violation in supersymmetric extension of the theory , the baryon asymmetry of the universe via thermal leptogenesis , and the cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "first we estimate the branching ratios of flavor - violating rare decays of charged leptons . in non - supersymmetric theory , the lepton flavor violation ( lfv )",
    "is suppressed and generally negligible because the only source of low - energy lfv is the light neutrino masses and is very small relative to the electroweak scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the supersymmetric ( susy ) theory generally predicts sizable magnitudes of lfv amplitudes since additional sources of lfv come from mass parameters of superparticles ( scalar leptons ) .",
    "this type of flavor - violating vertices are radiatively generated depending on the form of lepton mass matrices . in the following , we estimate the branching ratios of the rare decay processes @xmath86 for the cascade lepton matrices .",
    "we consider as a simple and conservative situation that soft susy - breaking masses of scalar leptons are universal at some boundary scale @xmath17",
    ". then their off - diagonal matrix elements are generated by radiative corrections from the dirac yukawa couplings of neutrinos  @xcite .",

    "the magnitude of these off - diagonal elements depend on the form of dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath74 and the scale of right - handed majorana masses @xmath90 .",

    "this is parameterized as @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the entropy density and @xmath153 is the effective number of degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium ; @xmath154 in the present epoch and @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) for the sm ( for the minimal susy sm ) .",
    "the numerical factor in denotes the equilibrium @xmath132 number density relative to the entropy density . as mentioned above , in supersymmetric theory the scalar neutrino decay",
    "roughly doubles the result .",
    "the efficiency factor @xmath157 is obtained by numerically solving the boltzmann equations and is a function of two parameters : the heavy mode mass @xmath60 and the effective light neutrino mass @xmath158 .",
    "in particular , the efficiency is known to depend only on @xmath159 when @xmath160 gev , which is realized in the cascade model [ see ] .",
    "that leads to an approximate formula  @xcite : @xmath161 with vanishing initial @xmath132 population .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that the cascade neutrino mass matrix leads to @xmath162 , and therefore the second term in becomes dominant .",
    "the baryon number asymmetry @xmath163 is transfered via spharelon interactions as @xmath164 in the sm and @xmath165 in the minimal susy sm . combining the above result and the mass parameters calculated previously",
    ", we obtain the baryon asymmetry of the universe in the cascade model [ taking account only of the leading ( second ) term in ] : @xmath166 where @xmath167 .",
    "an almost similar size of @xmath163 is obtained for the susy sm , considering the fact that the washout effect is two times stronger because of the additional decay channel to superpartners .",
    "the current experimental data at 95% confidence level shows that @xmath168 from the big bang nucleosynthesis result  @xcite and @xmath169 from the wmap 3-year mean result in the standard @xmath17 cold dark matter scenario  @xcite .",
    "then it is found that the magnitude of neutrino cascade hierarchy , @xmath170 is consistent with the baryon asymmetry of the universe with @xmath13 complex phases of mass parameters .",
    "in fact , for a larger value of the cascade hierarchy , the first term in becomes effective and must be taken into account in the analysis .",
    "consequently the above bound of @xmath171 is modified by an @xmath13 factor . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lpglfv ] , we plot the full numerical evaluation of phenomenological consequences of the cascade lepton matrices .     in the figure .",
    "a relative complex phase between the second and third - generation effects in is set to be constructive .",
    "the vertical shadow band is allowed by the cosmological observations at the 95% cl.,width=415 ]    in this figure , the cascade hierarchy parameters are around @xmath172 .",
    "it is found that , for this type of hierarchy , the @xmath105 rare decay process implies a lower bound on the superparticle mass scale to be larger than about @xmath173 gev , which is a bit heavier than scalar leptons in typical minimal supergravity scenarios .",
    "note that , for a larger hierarchy of the cascade , @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , the only modification is more suppression of the first term in and the above result is affected little .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath163 becomes tiny in the limit of a vanishing @xmath64 or equivalently a huge @xmath62 .",
    "in other words , an upper bound on @xmath62 , for example @xmath174 , leads to a restricted prediction of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "the maximal value of asymmetry shown in is obtained in the case of a smaller solar angle and a smaller @xmath66 within the range of experimental bounds .",
    "the corresponding lower bound means that the yukawa hierarchy in the neutrino sector is a bit smaller than in the charged - lepton sector ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "such a hierarchy factor may be reduced , for example , by taking a larger value of @xmath176 with suitable complex phases .",
    "another reasonable possibility is to consider different initial population of the right - handed neutrino @xmath132 at high temperature .",
    "more abundance of initial @xmath132 makes the efficiency factor larger .",
    "for example , if we choose the cascade factor @xmath116 as the same order of @xmath177 , then @xmath178 gev and the efficiency factor @xmath157 is enhanced by 1 - 3 orders of magnitude , depending on the initial @xmath132 abundance .",
    "this behavior makes @xmath163 enhanced and reduces @xmath116 by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude , which is consistent with @xmath179 .",
    "another important cp - violating phenomenon is the dirac - type cp violation in neutrino oscillations , which could be observed in future long baseline experiments .",
    "the effect of the dirac cp phase is expressed in terms of the quantity @xmath180 which is invariant under the rephasing and relabeling of fermion fields  @xcite . from the analysis of the generation mixing matrix in the previous section ,",
    "we find that @xmath180 from the cascade lepton mass matrices is given by @xmath181 ,    \\label{jcp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the leading approximation .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath180 is related to the lfv branching ratios as @xmath182 .",
    "further , from the cosmological analysis , the contribution of the first term in is found to be dominant .",
    "thus the cp violation in neutrino oscillations is approximately described by the phase of cascade hierarchy factor ; @xmath183 .",
    "as shown hereinbefore , the cascade form of lepton mass matrices leads to characteristic and correlated behaviors for flavor physics and cosmology .",
    "that deserves to be investigated in more detail and examined in future particle experiments .",
    "in this section we show that the cascade form of mass ( yukawa ) matrix has possible dynamical origins in high - energy regime .",
    "the cascade contains two step hierarchies of the orders of @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the former factor is concerned with the first generation and the latter with the second one .",
    "further , as argued above , the neutrino experimental data would suggest that the coefficients of effective mass ( yukawa ) operators are correlated to each other .",
    "these non - trivial properties imply some non - trivial implements introduced in fundamental theory beyond the standard model .      the first example is to introduce an abelian flavor symmetry .",
    "the standard model and its extensions contain three - generation left and right - handed fermions , @xmath184 and @xmath123 ( @xmath185 ) , and the higgs field which has a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath12 .",
    "in addition to these fundamental fields , here three gauge - singlet scalars @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) are also included .",
    "we write down the model in a supersymmetric way using @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath16 as corresponding superfields , but a non - susy theory is easy to construct with an additional symmetry which reflects the holomorphicity of superpotential terms .",
    "the quantum number assignment of @xmath51 flavor symmetry is determined in the following way:@xmath190 where @xmath191 is an arbitrary positive integer .",
    "we have taken the matter @xmath51 charges as symmetric ones ( @xmath192 ) and the third - generation fields have zero charges ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "the latter fact just defines the overall scale of induced mass terms , which scale can be easily reduced by a universal shifting of all charges so that @xmath194 .",
    "the effective mass terms come from the operators which are consistent with the flavor symmetry and are generally higher dimensional suppressed by the cutoff scale @xmath17 , at which the operators are effectively generated by high - scale dynamics .",
    "the induced dirac mass operators in the superpotential @xmath195 are now given by @xmath196      \\dfrac{\\phi_2^{m+1}}{\\lambda^{m+1 } } &      \\dfrac{\\phi_2}{\\lambda } & \\dfrac{\\phi_3}{\\lambda } \\\\[2 mm ]      \\dfrac{\\phi_2^m\\phi_3}{\\lambda^{m+1 } } & \\dfrac{\\phi_3}{\\lambda } & 1    \\end{array}\\right)v.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it would be expected that these scalar fields develop the same magnitude of expectation values @xmath197 , e.g.  governed by a single sector dynamics , and as a result the mass matrix becomes @xmath198 this is the cascade - form matrix with the hierarchy @xmath199 ( @xmath191 is an arbitrary positive integer ) .",
    "in fact , the quantum number assignment is shown to be unique , up to an overall rescaling , in the case that one flavor symmetry and three gauge - singlet fields generate the cascade .",
    "for the neutrino sector , the majorana mass matrix of right - handed neutrinos was taken to be flavor diagonal in the previous analysis .",
    "that is realized , e.g.  by introducing several scalars which transform non - trivially under additional symmetry ( the lepton number or some discrete symmetry ) .",
    "it is however noted that , as we mentioned before , the right - handed majorana mass matrix can also be of the cascade form , which is derived in a similar way to the above .",
    "the second example is an extension of the sm involving the extra spacetime beyond our four dimensions and the non - abelian discrete flavor symmetry as its heritage .",
    "an interesting key to realize the cascade form is the observation that the cascade is split into three layers ( see also fig.[fig : matrices ] ) : @xmath200 the first and second terms indicate the existence of non - abelian flavor symmetry which leads to generation - correlated values of matrix elements .",
    "the first two terms also contain the suppression factors relative to the last term .",
    "the dynamical origin of suppression is here traced to the dilution of existence probabilities in the extra spatial dimensions .",
    "let us consider a six - dimensional theory on the flat gravitational background .",
    "the extra two - dimensional space is compactified on the torus @xmath201 with the radii @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "in addition , the theory is assumed to have the @xmath204 invariance which acts as the @xmath205 rotation on @xmath201 .",
    "that implies the torus is the diamond ( @xmath206 ) with an interior angle @xmath205 .",
    "the torus is further divided by @xmath204 and results in the orbifold @xmath207 .",
    "the orbifold has three @xmath204 fixed points : @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 .",
    "the assertion of the equivalence of three fixed points may lead to the existence of permutation @xmath211 flavor symmetry in the low - energy effective theory of this setup  @xcite .",
    "we briefly show a schematic picture of field configuration in the extra dimensions .",
    "the three - generation left and right - handed fermions are assumed to be generation - separately localized on the three fixed points @xmath212 of the orbifold . as for the bosonic sector of the theory , we show a simple example that the electroweak higgs field @xmath213 comes from a six - dimensional scalar , and further three types of gauge - singlet scalars are arranged , @xmath214 in the bulk , @xmath215 on a line , and @xmath216 on a fixed point : the latter fixed point means @xmath217 corresponding to the third generation and the line connects two fixed points @xmath218 and @xmath217 on which the second and third - generation fermions reside .    the six - dimensional scalar @xmath214 couples to all the three - generation fermions .",
    "if the effective theory has independent flavor symmetry for left and right - handed fermions , the operators involving @xmath214 induce the lowest layer of the cascade [ the first term in the cascade matrix ] with the universal coefficient .",
    "the scalar @xmath215 , which extends into the fifth dimension , is separate from the first - generation fields due to the locality in the extra dimensions .",
    "that results in producing the middle layer of the cascade .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath215 operators may be controlled by a subgroup of flavor symmetry .",
    "similarly , the four - dimensional scalar @xmath216 couples to the third generation on the same fixed point , and hence induces the third term in the cascade matrix . as for the hierarchy ( the relative heights of the cascade layers )",
    ", it has an interesting dynamical origin in the present framework : it is determined by the volume of extra - dimensional space .",
    "that is , the scalar fields @xmath219 , which generate effective yukawa operators , have different dimensionality and then provide different volume suppression factors for mass matrix elements . in the above example ,",
    "the relative hierarchies are given by @xmath220 and @xmath221 where @xmath17 is the cutoff scale of the theory ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "it is possible to have a larger hierarchy , @xmath223 ( @xmath121 ) , if the scalar @xmath214 extends to more higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "finally we comment on the majorana mass term for right - handed neutrinos .",
    "it can be obtained in a similar way to the above by introducing extra scalar fields with different dimensionality .",
    "if these scalars have the lepton number one , the mass hierarchy in the right - handed majorana matrix is the square of that in the dirac one .",
    "this fact realizes in a dynamical way the result - with the central values of experimental data .",
    "the higher - dimensional framework has a variety of possible field configurations in different classes of extra - dimensional space , each of which has an individual low - energy prediction .",
    "other types of configurations are then constructed to realize the cascade - form matrix : a six - dimensional theory compactified on @xmath207 with three - generation fermions being localized on three different lines , a seven - dimensional theory compactified on a torus or octahedron with three generations extending to different directions of extra three spatial dimensions , etc .",
    "the scheme given in this subsection is just for illustration and an explicit construction of a realistic complete theory is left for future study .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the phenomenology of cascade mass matrices in the neutrino and charged - lepton sectors . implementing the seesaw mechanism ,",
    "an approximate tri - bimaximal generation mixing is found to be induced from hierarchical lepton mass matrices .",
    "the flat - cascade lepton matrices , which are well fitted to the experimental data , imply one parameter - independent relation among the observables , the generation mixing angles and mass eigenvalues .",
    "the relation means the correlated values of mixing angles , that behavior will be tested in future neutrino experiments .",
    "we have discussed several phenomenological aspects of the neutrino and charged - lepton mass matrices in the flat - cascade form .",
    "the first is the flavor - violating rare decay of charged leptons in supersymmetric standard models .",
    "while the branching ratios are suppressed due to small flavor mixing with fixed mass eigenvalues , several decay modes give observable effects and in turn impose the lower bound on the supersymmetry - breaking scale .",
    "the second is the cp - violating phenomena in neutrino oscillations and cosmology .",
    "the latter means the baryon asymmetry of the universe via the leptogenesis produced in the cascade model .",
    "the predictions of these quantities are found to be correlated and make the cascade - form mass matrix testable in near future .",
    "we have also illustrated several dynamical frameworks for realizing the cascade - form matrix .",
    "the dynamics involves the existence of flavor symmetry and/or extra spatial dimensions .",
    "along the lines presented here , the construction of realistic model including the quark sector and the investigation of induced phenomenology will be the next important tasks to probe the existence of cascades in nature .",
