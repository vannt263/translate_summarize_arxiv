    "m ) h band we used a model atmosphere , because currently no h band template spectra are available at our spectral resolution .",

    "the model atmosphere spectrum was substituted with the atmospheric transmission derived via the standard star , since this is probably more reliable , and the standard star does not show strong features in these wavelength ranges .",
    "the effect due to different zenith distance of source and standard star in h and k band was minimized using the atran atmospheric model ( lord 1992 ) , mainly to correct for the different atmospheric absorption .",

    "for a better comparison to the interferometer maps and to improve the signal - to - noise we convolved the images to a resolution of @xmath02.4  .",
    "knowledge of the properties of the molecular gas is essential to the understanding of star formation in and the fueling of agns , since molecular clouds are the major reservoir for these phenomena .",
    "interferometry at mm - wavelengths allows high angular resolution dynamical studies of the molecular gas in the vicinity of the active nucleus . for the first time we have detected the molecular line emission in the spiral arms of a qso host galaxy .",
    "in addition we are able to decompose the line emission into a core and disk component . analyzing the velocity field",
    "we have found a circumnuclear ring of molecular gas with similar size to starburst rings found in nearby galaxies . at our spatial resolution of 1.9  ( 2.2  kpc ) we see no obvious sign of gas streaming directly into the very nucleus .",
    "since the molecular gas is the reservoir for the star formation , it is important to investigate its distribution throughout the entire host galaxy .",
    "this can shed light on any differences which exist between the star forming processes in the host galaxy disk and those of the nuclear region .",
    "therefore we made integrated co emission maps ( fig.1 ) at spatial resolutions of 1.9  and 5.0  , using only emission exceeding the 3@xmath22 level in each channel .",
    "the nuclear peak in the co emission shows an offset of 1  compared to the vla coordinates , probably due to differences of the interferometer phase centers of the pdbi and the vla .",
    "+ in the 5  spatial resolution map we detect two spiral arms to the west and east of the nucleus ( fig.1 and 2 ( plate  1 ) ) . in the high resolution map",
    "these arms are apparent at the lowest contour level .",
    "the extended line emission from the host galaxy is resolved out at high resolution .",
    "the northwestern spiral arm has also been seen in optical and infrared broad - band images ( see section 7 ) .",
    "we also find a smooth disk with an extent of 20  ew and 13  ns .",
    "as shown in fig.1 most of the flux originates in the central 9  . in",
    "the 5  resolution map the nucleus has a fwhm of 6  , which results in an intrinsic diameter of about 3.3  after deconvolution with the clean beam at a spatial resolution of 5  . in the 1.9  resolution map the fwhm diameter of the core is about 3  , resulting in an intrinsic diameter of 2.3  . also the integral in a 5.5@xmath55.5  box centered on the nucleus in the 5  resolution map equals 10 jy  km  s@xmath15 whereas the integral in a 2@xmath52  box in the 1.9  resolution map results in a flux of about 5 jy  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the two measurements clearly indicate the presence of a more extended component , which is partially resolved in both maps .",
    "this shows that the interferometer data may not contain all of the total flux of the source .",
    "this is also supported by a comparison to iram 30  m data as shown in the following section .",
    "we have compared the spectrum taken by barvainis et al .",
    "( 1989 ) with the iram 30 m telescope with a total spectrum of our iram pdb interferometer observations to derive the overall extended line flux emitted by the disk of the i  zw  1 host galaxy .",
    "both spectra show a double horned profile , with the 30 m spectrum having more flux in the horns . in double horned line",
    "profiles the emission in the horns is dominated by an extended disk component .",
    "in addition the 30  m beam size is smaller than the optical disk size and of the same order as ( or as well smaller than ) the structure of the co line emission measured with the pdb interferometer .",
    "this indicates that our observations as well as the 30  m observations have missed some flux from the disk .",
    "the amount of flux missed by the two observations depends on the disk size , shape and assumed model ( see below and section 3.1.2 ) . to decompose the flux into a nuclear and a disk component we estimated the contribution of the compact 3.3  fwhm core ( we measured with the pbbi ) to the total flux ( 0.078 jy , value measured between the two horns ) of the 30  m telescope ( barvainis et al .",
    "from our low resolution @xmath1co ( 1 - 0 ) map we measure a fwhm of the nuclear component of about 3.3  and a peak flux of 0.040 jy close to the systemic velocity of i  zw  1 .",
    "as defined below we used correction factors f@xmath23 and f@xmath24 that have to be applied to the measured flux for the beam filling under the assumption that beam and source are both circular and the beam has a gaussian profile ( dickel 1976 ) .",
    "+   + if the intensity distribution of the source is gaussian , we get + @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the fwhm of the source and the beam . if the intensity distribution of the source is flat and disk - like ( heeschen 1961 ) , we obtain + @xmath28 where @xmath26 is the diameter of the uniform disk and @xmath27 is the fwhm of the beam . using the beam filling correction factors calculated from the known pdbi and 30 m beams and assuming a gaussian nuclear source size of 3.3  we find that the nucleus accounts for 0.056  jy , i.e. 70% of the total line flux measured by the 30 m telescope . we , therefore , decomposed the 30 m line flux into a nuclear ( 0.056 jy ) and a disk ( 0.022 jy ) component .",
    "+ the decomposition is consistent with the source extents and structures found in the channel maps ( fig.1 , 2 and 3 ) , and in optical and nir - images . alternatively",
    "the pdbi and 30 m spectra only match if we assume unrealistically high calibration errors @xmath29  20 % for both observed values , with the 30  m flux being too high and the pdbi flux being too low .      assuming a disk flux of 0.022  jy , we derive its size , since we have two measurements at different angular resolutions . for the disk",
    "we assume both gaussian and flat intensity distributions .",
    "the value of the background noise in the single channel maps is of the order of 0.006  jy ( 3@xmath22 level ) .",
    "this value was used together with the disk flux to estimate a lower limit to the spatial extent of the disk via the beam filling factors . for a gaussian ( flat ) flux distribution",
    "we get a disk diameter of 9  ( 12  ) or higher taking into account that parts of the extended emission might also have been missed by the 30  m measurements .",
    "this is in good agreement with the upper limit in disk size of about 30  obtained from optical and nir observations .",
    "this is especially true if we consider the extended wings in case of a more realistic gaussian distribution .",
    "the molecular disk size of the host galaxy should have an extent of about 10  kpc ( or larger ) , compared to that of the bright core component with a fwhm of 3.3  or about 3.9 kpc .",
    "our @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) spectrum shows a double - horn profile characteristic of rotating disks , and is similar to the co spectra of i  zw  1 presented in barvainis et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and eckart et al .",
    "the rotation of the extended disk emission is obvious in the channel maps ( fig.3 ) . from the mean velocity field ( fig.4 ) we measure a kinematic major axis position angle of 135@xmath4 .",
    "the velocity field shows no signs of a very strong interaction with the western companion .",
    "this companion is not detected at our s / n level of 0.006  jy .",
    "+ in fig.5 we present the position - velocity diagrams along the major kinematic axis for the two different spatial resolutions .",
    "each half of the p - v diagram represents the projected rotation curve for i  zw  1 .",
    "the exact inclination of the i  zw  1 host galaxy is not known , although the optical and nir - images indicate a fairly low inclination of @xmath0  40@xmath4 ( bothun et al . 1984 ) . to test this value for the inclination kinematically we assumed a typical disk rotation velocity of ( 250@xmath325 ) km / s ( rubin et al .",
    "1985 ) for the flat part of the rotation curve ( at a distance of about 10  ) assuming this is characteristic of motions in the disk . from this",
    "we derive an inclination in the range of ( 34@xmath34)@xmath4 depending on the chosen rotation velocity .",
    "this value is in approximate agreement with the shape of the 50% contour lines in the maps in fig.1 under the assumption that the co line emission has an intrinsically azimuthally symmetric distribution . as a compromise we have chosen a value of ( 38@xmath35)@xmath4 which would be consistent with a rotation velocity of ( 230@xmath330 ) km / s for the disk",
    "this value , as well as the position angle of the major axis of 135@xmath4 that we get from the co velocity field are in agreement with the observed ellipticity of the r band image ( hutchings & crampton 1990 ) assuming an intrinsically circular disk .",
    "the p - v diagrams show evidence for a circumnuclear ring , extended disk emission and the presence of a large molecular cloud complex located close to the nucleus . in the following",
    "we will summarize observational properties of these regions :    _ the circumnuclear ring : _ the pv - diagram ( fig.5a ) made at 1.9  angular resolution has two flux peaks at velocities of @xmath3180 km / s , indicating the presence of a nuclear ring or spiral arms , with a diameter of about 1.6  .",
    "the nuclear velocity dispersion was measured in a pv - diagram along the kinematic minor axis .",
    "the values given below are the 50% contour widths corrected for the spectral resolution .",
    "the intrinsic velocity dispersion is estimated assuming a gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "the nuclear source exhibits a high velocity dispersion of @xmath22=350 km / s , assuming that the gas is isothermal and that the velocity dispersion is radius independent for radii less than 2  .",
    "this is also clearly demonstrated and supported by the pv - diagrams along the minor axis ( fig.5 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath22 derived above may not only be due to pure cloud - cloud velocity dispersion but may also contain contributions from a more complex velocity field like a tilted ring system as in centarus  a ( nicholson et al .",
    "1992 , quillen et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 , sparke 1996 ) or streaming motions .",
    "+ _ the gmc complex : _ the single emission peak at a velocity of 220 km / s and approximately 2e and 2s of the nucleus could be due to a molecular gas complex located in or near the nuclear ring .",
    "this gmc complex also appears in the low spatial resolution map ( fig.5c ) .",
    "it seems to be kinematically unresolved , indicating a small velocity dispersion of about 20 km / s , similar to what is observed for gmc complexes in our galaxy .",
    "the molecular mass contained in this complex ( estimated from the co luminosity read off from the pv - diagrams in fig.5 ) is @xmath0 5 % of the total nuclear molecular gas mass .",
    "this is one order of magnitude higher than that measured for gmc complexes in our galaxy . + _ the disk emission : _ the flat part of the rotation curve levels out at velocities of @xmath3140 km / s .",
    "our s / n ratio enables us to trace the extended disk emission out to radii of 18  kpc .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the disk component is @xmath0 17 km / s . + _ modelling the p - v diagrams : _ we have calculated model pv - diagrams to improve our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the nucleus and the disk of i  zw  1 ( see fig .",
    "the model projects a given galaxy flux geometry onto a sky grid taking inclination and tilt into account . to this flux geometry a rotation curve is applied . the beam size and velocity resolution of the observation",
    "are then used to calculate the model pv - diagram . to model the molecular gas emission in i  zw  1",
    "we assumed a two component gaussian flux distribution .",
    "one gaussian had a fwhm of 10  centered at a radius of 4  and the other a fwhm of 1.65  centered at a radius of 0.8  .",
    "the ratio between the two gaussian flux peaks was 50 with the inner one being the brighter one .",
    "this model flux distribution is plotted in fig.6 .",
    "+ the azimuthally symmetric modelled p - v diagrams match the measured ones very well , except that they do not reproduce emission from the single gmc complex .",
    "also they account only approximately for the emission of the disk component .",
    "the remaining differences between the data and the model are due to the presence of spiral arms in the observed maps ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the modelled p - v diagrams do demonstrate the need of a circumnuclear ring - like distribution of the molecular gas , as well as the need for a high velocity dispersion in the nuclear source",
    ". this high velocity dispersion could be due to gas streaming along a bar , because the nuclear emission in the velocity field ( fig.4 ) is slightly s - shaped as one would expect for streaming ( sanders & tubbs 1980 , tacconi et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "since the molecular gas mass is a substantial part of the dynamical mass , it is essential to know its distribution and mass . with velocity widths of 380 km / s for the nucleus and 310 km / s ( distance horn - to - horn ) for the disk and a @xmath9-conversion factor of 2.0@xmath510@xmath10@xmath30 ( strong et al .",

    "the diagnostic ratios calculated from the above values indicate a young decaying starburst with an age of @xmath01.3@xmath510@xmath32yrs and a moderate upper mass cut - off of m@xmath59 @xmath0 15 m@xmath7 .",
    "the ratios are also in agreement with an old ( @xmath010@xmath6 yrs ) , constant starburst and an upper mass cut - off of 20 to 30 m@xmath7 . in any case our estimates of the diagnostic ratios indicate active star formation in the northwestern arm of the i  zw  1 host galaxy disk .",
    "from our irac2  h and k ( fig.7 ) band images as well as the v and i band hst images ( see fig.2 ( plate  1 ) ) we obtained flux densities ( and the corresponding magnitudes ) in 5  circular apertures centered on the northwestern arm ( 9  w and 5n ) , on the western companion , and on the nucleus of i  zw  1 itself .",

    "+ the spiral galaxy data for representative rc3 types 0 to 2 ( s0 - sab ) and 6 to 8 ( scd - sdm ) were taken from de jong ( 1996 ) .",

    "for these three objects the h band magnitudes were derived using the mean nir colors of the other ellipticals in the same sample . in fig.9",
    "we display the combined data .",

    "for the nucleus the data are from kotilainen , ward , williger ( 1993 ) for v and i band , and kotilainen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for h and k band measured in a 3  circular aperture centered on the nucleus .",
    "+ in addition we checked the relative calibration of the v and i band data on i  zw  1 using the visible ( 380600  nm ) and red ( 660965  nm ) spectra of the nucleus published by hutchings & crampton ( 1990 ) and osterbrock , shaw & veilleux ( 1990 ) .",
    "hutchings & crampton ( 1990 ) also provide an absolute calibration of their optical spectrum and give a calibrated r band map .",
    "these spectra are almost continuous in wavelength range and allow us to estimate the spectral shape of the nucleus ranging from the v to i band .",
    "the data are consistent with the v and i band calibration provided by the hst , indicating that the i band flux density dip in the broad band spectrum of the nucleus of i  zw  1 is real .",
    "this dip spectrally separates the blue optical qso nucleus from the red dusty circumnuclear environment in which the qso nucleus is embedded . +   + comparing the broad band spectra of spirals and ellipticals to those we obtained on the off - nuclear regions in i  zw  1 , and the companion we find that in general , the optical colors of the spiral arm and the companion are bluer than what expected for normal ( nearby ) ellipticals and spiral galaxies .",
    "their spectra have shapes quite comparable to those of spirals and ellipticals .",
    "the spectrum of the spiral arm ( and within the errors also the spectrum of the companion ) is as blue as or bluer than the spectrum of central 3  of the seyfert  i galaxy ngc  7469 , where a substantial fraction of the light is originating in a circumnuclear starburst ( genzel et al .",
    "an indication that host galaxies of qsos at higher redshift may , in general , be bluer than what expected for normal ( nearby ) ellipticals and spiral galaxies is given by several authors .",

    "rnback et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find blue hosts in 16 out of 21 qsos and quasars in the redshift range of z=0.4 to 0.8 .",
    "the blue disk colors we find for the i  zw  1 host demonstrates that not only the spectral line emission of the i  zw  1 qso nucleus shows properties of high - redshift qsos ( the blue shifted civ line - buson & ulrich 1990 - and the blue shifted sivi line - this paper in section 4.2.1 ) , but also that the i  zw  1 host galaxy has structural and broad band spectral properties similar to those of high redshift qso host galaxies .    the bluer colors may indicate enhanced star formation , and are consistent with the interpretation of hutchings & crampton ( 1990 ) that the disk generally shows an early type population .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the result of our starburst analysis in the previous section .",
    "the star formation activity , as well as the presence of molecular material within the disk ( section 3.1 ) and on the arm , indicates that at least in this region  12  kpc off the nucleus  it is most likely star formation that is responsible for the blue disk colors .",
    "an alternative explanation for the blue disk colors might be a contribution of scattered light from the nucleus as in the case of 3c  234 ( tran , cohen and goodrich 1995 ) or cygnus  a ( ogle et al . 1997 ) .",
    "how large such a contribution might be has to be investigated by high angular resolution spectro - polarimetry of the i  zw  1 host galaxy .",
    "our study of the host galaxy of i  zw  1 covers the wavelength range from the radio to the optical . we have mapped the distribution of molecular gas in the qso host in its @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) line emission .",

    "this amounts to about 20% of the dynamical mass in the center . modeling the disk dynamics",
    "suggests an inclination of 38@xmath4@xmath35@xmath4 . the mass balance for the nucleus results in a @xmath9-conversion factor in general agreement with 2@xmath510@xmath10@xmath11 found for molecular gas in our galaxy and many nearby external galaxies .",

    "nir spectroscopy of the central 3  has revealed the presence of a prominent stellar component in this region .",
    "combined with available radio data we conclude that a young , massive , and decaying starburst is associated with this circumnuclear ring .",
    "the properties of this starburst ring are similar to the ones observed in other sources with nuclear activity .",
    "these similarities indicate that these rings may be a common phenomenon and contribute a significant fraction to the central luminosity .",
    "+   + our h and k band images as well as v and i band hst images , together with data taken from the literature , show that the star formation in the _ disk _ of i  zw  1 is enhanced as well .",
    "a comparison with broad band spectra of spiral galaxies , ellipticals and the nucleus and disk in ngc  7469 clearly suggests that the north western arm in the i  zw  1 host galaxy is bluer than expected .",
    "the enhanced star formation in the host may indicate tidal interaction with a companion that shows an energy distribution similar to ellipticals .",
    "the companion s optical spectrum is also marginally bluer than expected .",
    "a similar behaviour is found for host galaxies of intermediate redshift qsos and quasars .",
    "+   + in summary we find that both the nucleus and the disk of i  zw  1 show properties of higher redshift qsos and their host galaxies .",
