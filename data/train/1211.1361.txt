    "an interesting duality of nature is that the most complex systems usually obey the most simple rules .",
    "for instance , fractals exhibit delicate entanglement of geometric features which emerge from specific local rules .",
    "similarly , the ubiquity of scale independent ( or scale - free ) organization , found throughout natural , technological and human systems @xcite , though somewhat puzzling , can be reproduced by simple stochastic models ( e.g. critical percolation @xcite , self - organized criticality @xcite , diffusion - limited aggregation @xcite and preferential attachment @xcite ) .",
    "our project aims to uncover the secret ingredients shared by these stochastic models and the empirical data they reproduce , in the hope of unifying our understanding of the growth of complex critical systems .",
    "more precisely , the present report deals with the temporal evolution of one particular feature of these critical systems : the scale independent distribution of a given quantity @xmath0 among the @xmath1 elements of the system .",
    "mathematically , two very general hypotheses will be used to describe the systems under study :    1 .",
    "the asymptotic proportion @xmath2 of elements of size @xmath3 follows a power law : @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 for normalization ) ; 2 .",
    "relative to other elements , an element will grow at a rate @xmath6 dictated mostly by its size @xmath3 and not by some hidden variable .    as a consequence of these two hypotheses",
    ", we can state that @xmath7 at least for @xmath8 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the second hypothesis also implies that elements of a given size @xmath3 are indiscernible from each other . as a general notation",
    ", we will use @xmath9 for the average number of elements of size @xmath3 at time @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 is the average total population at time @xmath10 , and @xmath12 , the studied distribution .",
    "we can now state that the growth of the system follows a simple set of equations : @xmath13}{\\sum _ { k ' } g(k')n_{k'}(t ) } \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : growth}\\ ] ] the first @xmath14 is the probability of a birth event ( which affect size @xmath15 only ) , and the last term is the probability of a growth event affecting an element of size @xmath3 ( either by bringing an element of size @xmath16 to @xmath3 or by moving an element of size @xmath3 to @xmath17 ) .",
    "all variables are discrete as size is numbered in units of growth events , just as time @xmath10 corresponds to the total number of events ( birth or growth ) since the birth of the system .",
    "our hypothesis # 2 provides a general form for the _ growth function _ , @xmath7 , which is typically referred to as _ preferential attachment_. to completely define eq .",
    "( [ eq : growth ] ) , we must find a similarly general form for the _ birth function _ @xmath14 .",
    "this function yields the probability that the @xmath10-th event in the system s history corresponds to the birth of a new element .",
    "the search for a functional form , analytic or heuristic , of @xmath14 will occupy a major part of our contribution . note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : growth ] ) does not consider the potential death of elements , these events are considered indiscernible from the state of `` not growing ever again '' and are thus averaged within the growth function for simplicity .",
    "we study the probability @xmath14 that the @xmath10-th event in the system marks the birth of a new element , as opposed to a growth event .",
    "let us consider a system which follows the simplest growth rules , i.e. , apart from our two hypothesis , let us assume that the birth rate is given by @xmath18 while the growth rate of an element of size @xmath3 is @xmath19 .",
    "the system is conservative ( i.e. no death events ) such that we are interested in how @xmath14 falls to zero as the population goes to infinity . we can directly write @xmath14 as the ratio of birth rate to the sum of birth and growth rates : @xmath20 as @xmath21 is a monotonous and slowly decreasing function of @xmath3 , we can approximate the finite sum by the equivalent integral and relegate the error made for very small @xmath3 as part of the integration constant and is therefore significant for small @xmath3 solely .",
    "this implies that the error due to the approximation of the sum by the integral is independent of the growth of @xmath22 . ] . equation ( [ law0 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath23 where all capital case letters are irrelevant constants . to further simplify this last expression",
    ", one must determinate the behaviour of the largest element @xmath24 at time @xmath10 . in appendix b",
    ", we show that @xmath25 , which yields @xmath26    as @xmath14 falls towards zero , we see that it reaches an asymptotic _ temporal scaling _ with @xmath27 with exponent @xmath28 .",
    "note that assuming normalization of the target distribution in @xmath29 implies @xmath5 , thereby allowing the temporal dependence of @xmath14 to scale with either positive or negative exponents .",
    "however , because of the challenge inherent to accurately evaluating the slope of a power - law @xcite , especially if it changes as the system evolves , we will leave this exponent adjustable .",
    "furthermore , as the only term function of @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ law1 ] ) is related to the total number of growth events , it is expected to be much larger than @xmath30 .",
    "hence , it is useful to approximate the global behaviour of @xmath14 with the functional form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 delays the temporal scaling in @xmath33 towards the limit @xmath34 .",
    "we have here assumed that dissipative systems ( with death events ) will follow a qualitatively similar dynamics as @xmath14 goes to its asymptotic value @xmath34 .",
    "this hypothesis will be tested on various systems .",
    "let us now consider a two - dimensional square lattice where at each step ( @xmath35 ) one of @xmath36 sites is randomly chosen for a percolation trial . with probability @xmath37 , the site is occupied and the system clock is increased by one ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "sites can only be chosen once for this trial .",
    "we study the behaviour of connected clusters .",
    "what is the probability @xmath14 that the @xmath10-th occupied site creates a new cluster of size one ( none of his four neighbours is occupied yet ) ?",
    "this probability defines the ratio between the growth of the cluster population to the number of occupied sites .",
    "we expect @xmath14 to follow eq .",
    "( [ law ] ) , since it is known that percolation leads to a critical state where cluster sizes follow a power - law distribution ( hypothesis 1 ) and it is simple to imagine how a larger cluster has more growth potential than a smaller one because it has more neighbouring sites ( hypothesis 2 ) , the perimeter of a cluster of size @xmath3 scales as @xmath3 @xcite . ] .",
    "the @xmath10-th occupied site will mark the birth of a new cluster if none of his four neighbours were among the @xmath39 first occupied sites .",

    "( [ perco_law ] ) does not depend on the percolation probability @xmath37 . under this form ,",
    "the ability of this system to converge towards its critical state depends on the number of sites occupied , i.e. time @xmath10 . noting that @xmath52 , the critical time @xmath53 , corresponding to the critical point in @xmath37 , could perhaps be calculated through a self - consistent argument on the number of occupied sites required by the scale - free distribution of cluster size in the critical state .",
    "this is however , not our current concern .",
    "this section presents numerical studies of growth processes for which analytical solutions of the birth function @xmath14 are unavailable .      in constrast to systems , like percolation , which are critical at a phase transition ,",
    "other systems are known to always converge to their critical state , without the need to adjust any parameters .",
    "this asymptotic criticality is often referred to as _ self - organized criticality _ ( soc ) .",
    "the first and simplest example of soc is the bak - tang - wiesenfeld model @xcite , a sandpile system where grains are dropped on a surface and grains @xmath54 of a given site @xmath55 topple on the four nearest neighbours @xmath56 if @xmath54 reaches a threshold @xmath57 .",
    "the algorithm is    in addition to the self - organized property of this model ( hypothesis 1 ) , larger potential avalanches have more neighbouring sites resulting in a bigger growth potential ( hypothesis 2 ) .",
    "hence , the probability that the @xmath10-th site marks the creation of a new potential avalanche is expected to follow eq .",
    "( [ law ] ) .",
    "moreover , we can also expect the constant @xmath34 to be non - zero because of the dissipative nature of the model : avalanches occur and thus stop growing , new potential avalanches will consequently continuously appear .",

    "the process was developed as a model of aggregation in systems where diffusion is the primary means of transport and where forces are negligible .",

    "real examples of dla - like aggregation can be observed in systems such as electrodeposition , mineral deposits and dielectric breakdown .",
    "using results of hinrichsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , it is easy to show that the length of branches in the brownian trees produced by dla follows a power - law distribution . here , branches are differentiated according to their order : the trunk is the zeroth - order branch and branches stemming from a branch of order @xmath59 are of order @xmath60 .",
    "results demonstrate that the length @xmath61 and the number @xmath62 of branches of order @xmath59 are exponential functions of @xmath59 : @xmath63 the number @xmath64 of branches of length @xmath36 is found using @xmath65 : @xmath66 the distribution of the lengths of the branches is scale - free most likely because longer branches gain an advantage by overshadowing smaller branches , i.e. the higher a branch reaches , the more likely it is that a random trajectory crosses its path ( hypothesis 2 ) .",
    "we will follow the probability @xmath14 that a grain which reaches the aggregate marks the beginning of a new branch by attaching to the body of a branch and not to its tip .",
    "figure [ dlaresults ] illustrates how this property evolves according to eq .",

    "results of this simple experiment are presented on fig .",

    "this last concept refers to the evolution of the ratio of links to nodes in connected systems . in the case of scale - free ( or scale independent ) networks ,",
    "this densification was observed to behave as a power - law relation between the number of nodes and the number of links @xcite .",
    "based on our previous results , we can conjecture a more precise relation .    in analogy to our law ,",
    "the number @xmath71 of links would be directly proportional to the total number of events ( or more precisely time @xmath72 as one link involves two nodes ) while the number of nodes is directly related to the total population @xmath73 . as these databases do not consider node removal ( death events ) , we have @xmath74 and @xmath48 .",

    "this last scenario , while very different from a simple power - law growth as previously proposed , corresponds perfectly to the predictions of our theory .",
    "in conclusion , we have provided theoretical arguments and empirical justifications that a system which converges toward a scale - free ( critical ) organization through constant growth rules will feature delayed temporal scaling in the frequency of birth events .",
