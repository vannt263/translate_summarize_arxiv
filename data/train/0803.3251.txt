    "in the past decade , the study of coherent structures with topological charge has become increasingly popular in hamiltonian systems .",
    "this has been especially so due to the emergence of both nonlinear optical , as well as atomic physics settings where such studies were experimentally relevant .",
    "recent reviews both in the framework of optical fibers and waveguides @xcite , as well as in that of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite have given overviews of this rapidly growing area of research ; see also @xcite .",
    "it is particularly interesting that both of these directions are associated with the prototypical dispersive equation that supports such structures , namely the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in the context of dilute alkali vapors forming becs at extremely low temperatures , the experimental realization of one as well as a few vortices @xcite , followed by the realization of very robust vortex lattices @xcite has had a profound influence on the field .",
    "more recently , experimental efforts have turned to higher - charged vortices , illustrating not only how vortices of topological charge @xmath0 and even @xmath1 can be imprinted @xcite , but also the dynamical instability of such waves @xcite .",
    "these experimental works have caused an intense theoretical interest in the existence and stability of vortices , especially under the case of parabolic confinement which is customary in becs due to magnetic trapping .",
    "while vortices of topological charge @xmath2 were found to be stable in a parabolic potential , higher topological charges were found to be unstable .",
    "the work of @xcite illustrated the potential instability ( for appropriate values of the number of atoms i.e. , the spatially integrated square modulus of the solution ) of @xmath0 and @xmath3 waveforms .",
    "later , the work of @xcite shed light into the case of @xmath1 and the role of negative energy eigenmodes in the instability .",
    "the studies of @xcite and @xcite examined the various scenaria of split - up of higher charge vortices during dynamical evolution simulations for repulsive and attractive interactions ( i.e. , defocusing and focusing nonlinear schrdinger equations ) respectively .",
    "the work of @xcite examined such vortices riding on the background of not just the ground state , but also of higher , ring - like , excited states of the system . in the context of an optical lattice ,",
    "the authors of @xcite tried to construct both higher charge vortices , and super - vortices for attractive condensates in optical lattices , while in the repulsive setting the so - called gap vortices have been predicted @xcite and systematically created @xcite .",
    "more recently , these notions have also been examined from a more mathematically rigorous point of view , using tools such as the evans function to compute the eigenvalue spectrum @xcite , or weak perturbations from the linear limit , to obtain a full count on the potentially unstable eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "one essential limitation of almost all of the above studies regarding the existence and stability of the vortices has been the radial nature of the symmetry of the parabolically confined system . in that",
    "radially symmetric setting , the authors of the above theoretical references proceeded to convert the problem to an effectively one - dimensional one along the radial direction , which it is straightforward to solve by a shooting method or otherwise .",
    "then , when the so - called bogolyubov - de gennes ( or linear stability ) analysis was performed around the ensuing radial excitations , the radial symmetry was again crucially involved , as the angular dependence of the perturbation modes was decomposed into fourier modes , resulting into a one - parameter infinity of radial problems ( indexed by the wavenumber of the angular mode ) ; for the mathematical details of this analysis see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , subsequent examination of only the lower modes in the resulting quasi-1d stability problem is sufficient to extract conclusions on the stability of the full 2d radial state .",
    "it should be mentioned in passing that the more recent works of @xcite considered the stability of multiply quantized vortices in three - dimensional becs .",
    "this above radial approach , however , does not allow us to examine the stability of states in the presence of _ both _ a magnetic trap and an optical lattice . in the latter setting , the combined potential breaks the radial symmetry and defies any one - dimensional approach towards the identification of the solutions or of their stability .",
    "in view of that , while numerous works examine the existence and linear stability of states in the presence of the parabolic trap , references that address the properties of the vortices in combined potentials are scant ; in fact , we are only aware of the direct integration results of @xcite which illustrate the disparity of the effects of the optical lattice phase on vortices of @xmath2 , and of the entirely theoretical work of @xcite that calculated the normal modes of the system based on a lagrangian approach .    our purpose in the present work is to examine systematically both the existence and the stability of both single - charged as well as multiply charged vortices in the presence of the combined parabolic and periodic potentials .",
    "the considerable numerical load that is required to perform the relevant computations ( and which , we believe , is what prevented an earlier study of this topic ) is circumvented with two separate variations of newton s method which both allow us to perform equally efficient fixed point iteration that converges on numerically exact solutions of the system .",
    "the variations differ in the method of handling the linear system in each newton iteration , which is far beyond the capacity of a standard direct linear solvers .",
    "one scheme implements an iterative linear solver in each newton step , and the other implements a standard sparse banded matrix solver .",
    "we subsequently critically use the sparse nature of the relevant stability matrices to invoke a sparse arnoldi iterative algorithm for approximating the system s eigenvalues , which , in turn , allows us to determine the linear stability ( i.e. , to computationally perform the bogolyubov - de gennes analysis ) of the resulting vortices .",
    "this permits us to develop two - parameter diagrams ( as a function of the chemical potential , and of the strength of the periodic potential ) for the existence and stability of solutions with @xmath2 and @xmath0 ; we also briefly touch upon solutions with @xmath3 that can also be obtained by the above means .",
    "finally , we examine the dynamical evolution of these solutions when they are unstable .    our presentation will be structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give an overview of our theoretical setup . in section 3",
    ", we develop our numerical results for the vortices of different topological charge , while in section 4 , we summarize our findings and present some interesting directions for future research .",
    "we assume the well known dimensionless setting for a confined bec in harmonic oscillator units @xcite , given as the following :    @xmath4    @xmath5 \\label{eq1c } \\\\",
    "v(x , y ) & = & v_m+ v_{ol}. \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the two dimensional laplacian operator @xmath7 , @xmath8 denotes the strength of the optical lattice and @xmath9 characterizes the effective tightness of the magnetic trap , while @xmath10 is an arbitrary phase shift .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the case of the , so - called , pancake - shaped ( i.e. , quasi - two - dimensional ) becs where @xmath11 . by assuming a standing wave solution of the form @xmath12 , we are able to locate stationary states by solving the following equation with a fixed point algorithm ( such as a newton method ) :    @xmath13    in the newton iteration , we have the following update scheme ( where we define @xmath14 in the equivalent case of the real formulation and @xmath15 represents the jacobian of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 where    @xmath19    for @xmath20 , in the linear limit , @xmath21",
    ", we recognize the two - dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) , for which the eigenfunctions are explicitly known in the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the product of the @xmath24 in x and @xmath25 in y hermite polynomials .",
    "the advantage of this underlying linear problem is that it allows us to generate the structure of a single charge vortex in 2d as a linear combination of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , according to @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , a linear , doubly charged vortex - type state can be constructed as @xmath31 and such constructions can also be produced for higher charges , as well .",
    "these can be used as good initial guesses for the fixed point iteration , towards producing a solution of the full nonlinear problem . in what follows ,",
    "we perform a two - parameter continuation in @xmath32 , which corresponds to the chemical potential of the bec ( and is related to its number of atoms ) , and in @xmath8 which parametrizes the strength of the ol potential .",
    "a uniform space mesh with @xmath33 is used to prevent contamination of spurious modes which may occur when the spatial scale of the unstable bound state in the vortex core competes with the grid size .",
    "solutions were found with both a standard banded solver for each newton iteration as well as a newton - krylov gmres scheme with the matlab script * nsoli * @xcite .",
    "the total necessary storage space was minimized with the krylov method , by approximating the directional derivative in the direction of subsequent krylov vectors and iteratively solving the linear system in each newton step . for a system of size @xmath34 ( about @xmath35 nodes )",
    "no more than 400 mb of ram was used and a solution ( within @xmath36 ) for a single charge vortex with @xmath20 and @xmath37 took 80 seconds to compute . the same solution using a standard sparse banded solver took 60 seconds and used 500 mb of ram .",
    "a 64-bit amd processor was used for the computations .",
    "once the solution of the nonlinear problem has been identified to a prescribed accuracy ( typically @xmath38-@xmath36 ) , we solve the linearized eigenvalue problem of the bogolyubov - de gennes equations @xcite to determine the stability of each solution .",
    "to do so , we introduce a complex - valued perturbation as follows : @xmath39 , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "then , substituting @xmath41 into ( [ eq1a ] ) , ignoring terms of order @xmath42 , collecting terms of @xmath43 , and then separating the ones with like phase ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) we obtain the following eigensystem for @xmath46 :    = ,    where we define @xmath47    in this eigenvalue problem for @xmath46 , we see from the expansion above that im@xmath48 re@xmath49 , and so the eigenfrequencies that satisfy this condition are those which lead to instability of our stationary wave solution",
    ". we will henceforth refer to the eigenvalues @xmath50 for clarity .",
    "returning to our discretized space mesh and the finite difference approximation to the laplacian in order to calculate the values for @xmath46 , we notice that the system is sparse and so it is well suited for the use of a sparse arnoldi iterative algorithm for approximating the eigenvalues .",
    "such a method is implemented by arpack that is invoked by the matlab function * eigs * , which we use for our calculations .",
    "the hamiltonian nature of the system guarantees that the eigenvalues come in quadruples @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "so we are only concerned with @xmath53 such that re@xmath54 is non - zero .",
    "we will follow the above procedure , scanning the parameter space for quantized vortex states in the presence of the potential @xmath55 , for both the cases where the vortex is centered at a local maximum ( @xmath56 ) and a minimum ( @xmath57 ) at the bottom of the parabolic trap .",
    "finally , once the solution is identified and the eigenvalues of linearization around it are obtained , we confirm our stability results by dynamically evolving these solutions over time .",
    "such numerical results for vortices with @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 are presented below .",
    "we start by investigating the stability of the single quantized vortex state in the cases of @xmath56 and @xmath57 over a range of chemical potentials , @xmath32 between @xmath58 ( the qho linear limit for such a state with @xmath20 ) , and @xmath59 . for @xmath20 ,",
    "our results confirm previous ones @xcite in that the single quantized vortex is stable in the presence of a pure parabolic potential over all values of @xmath32 .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , we found the @xmath56 case to be stable over all @xmath8 as well , in agreement with the dynamical observations of @xcite , where such a solution was observed to remain at its location , when initialized in the center of such a potential . an example density profile and spectrum",

    "the instability of the vortices with @xmath2 and that of the vortices with @xmath0 are _ fundamentally _ different .",

    "the latter predominantly involves the effect of _ splitting _ of the vortex of charge 2 into two vortices of charge @xmath2 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] , [ fig9 ] and [ figd2 ] ) , as a result of this splitting , the two same charge vortices ( as is discussed e.g. in @xcite ) , start rotating around each other ( while , of course , spiraling away from the center of the trap ) .",
    "this type of effect ( the break - up of the @xmath0 into two @xmath2 vortices ) may even happen in the magnetic trap alone for solutions in one of the instability bands at @xmath20 , rendering vortices of @xmath0 potentially unstable in that setting as discussed e.g. in @xcite .    in view of this , the two cases of @xmath2 and @xmath0 and their respective instability growth rates ( and trends )",
    "should not be directly compared as they physically refer to different mechanisms .",
    "one of the two potentials ( the @xmath56 case ) can be thought of as a `` local inhomogeneity '' within the central well of the optical lattice , while the other one ( the @xmath57 ) can be thought of , within the same region , as an approximate parabolic potential ( modulated by an appropriately weak gaussian past the first maximum of the optical lattice ) .",
    "while this picture can be fairly successful in capturing the stability characteristics of the optical lattice for small values of the chemical potential ( results not shown ) , for strong nonlinearities ( large chemical potentials ) this picture is no longer valid .",
    "it is only in the latter strongly nonlinear regime where the growth rates of the instabilities in the cases of the two different phases of the optical lattice potential are substantially different .",
