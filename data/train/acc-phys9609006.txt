    "due to high currents in modern accelerators and colliders , even contributions from small discontinuities of the vacuum chamber to the impedance budget of the machine have to be accounted for .",
    "numerous pumping holes  a few hundred per meter  in the vacuum screen of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) can serve as an example .",
    "their total contribution to the machine impedance in the initial design was calculated @xcite using the bethe theory of diffraction of em - waves by a small hole in a metal plane @xcite , and found to be dangerously large , close to the beam instability threshold .",
    "proposed design changes reduced the impedance more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the method s basic idea is that the hole , at frequencies where the wavelength is large compared to the typical hole size , can be replaced by two induced dipoles , an electric and a magnetic one .",
    "using essentially the same idea , the method was extended for arbitrary - shaped small discontinuities on the pipe of an arbitrary - shaped cross section @xcite . the impedance calculation for a given small discontinuity",
    "was therefore reduced to finding its electric and magnetic polarizabilities .",
    "analytical results in this direction have been obtained for axisymmetric obstacles , as well as for holes and slots : circular @xcite and elliptic @xcite holes in a zero - thickness wall , circular and elliptic holes in a thick wall , various slots @xcite , and a ring - shaped cut @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite the method",
    "was applied to calculate the coupling impedances of obstacles protruding inside the beam pipe , like a narrow post or a mask intercepting synchrotron radiation .",
    "formulas derived make practical estimates very simple . numerical simulations required to obtain similar results are necessarily 3d ones , and therefore are rather involved .",
    "this statement is generally applicable for any small discontinuities , but especially for those protruding into the vacuum chamber .",
    "below we list the analytical results @xcite and compare them with simulations .",
    "the longitudinal coupling impedance of a small discontinuity on the wall of a circular beam pipe of radius @xmath0 is @xcite @xmath1 when the wavelength @xmath2 is large compared to the obstacle size . here",
    "@xmath3  @xmath4 is the impedance of free space , @xmath5 is the wave number , and @xmath6 are the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the discontinuity .",
    "the transverse impedance is proportional to the same combination of polarizabilities @xmath7 , and the real part of the impedance is small at such frequencies ( see @xcite for detail , as well as for other chamber cross sections ) .",
    "let the obstacle shape be a half - ellipsoid with semiaxis @xmath8 in the longitudinal direction ( along the chamber axis ) , @xmath9 in the radial direction , and @xmath10 in the azimuthal one . when @xmath11 , the obstacle is small and the bethe approach can be applied . to find the polarizabilities , one needs to calculate the induced electric dipole moment @xmath12 of the obstacle illuminated by a homogeneous radial electric field @xmath13 , and the magnetic dipole moment @xmath14 when it is illuminated by an azimuthal magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "this problem was reduced @xcite to the well - known problem for an ellipsoid immersed in a homogeneous field , e.g. , @xcite . adding obvious symmetry considerations , we get @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by eq .  ( [ i ] ) with @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "in the case @xmath19 , @xmath20 we have an ellipsoid of revolution , and the integral in eq .  ( [ i ] ) can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath21 : @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 , which corresponds to a pin - like obstacle , @xmath25 $ ] is much larger than @xmath26 .",
    "note that in this limit @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the volume occupied by the obstacle ( and subtracted from that occupied by the beam magnetic field ) , somewhat similarly to the axisymmetric case .",
    "these results give us a simple expression for the inductive impedance of an * narrow pin ( post ) * of height @xmath29 and radius @xmath8 , @xmath24 , protruding radially into the beam pipe : in eq .",
    "( [ zpin ] ) to @xmath30 . ] @xmath31    one more particular case of interest here is @xmath32 , i.e. a * semispherical obstacle * of radius @xmath8 . from eqs .",
    "( [ ae1])-([am1 ] ) the impedance of such a discontinuity is @xmath33 which is @xmath34 times that for a circular hole of the same radius in a thin wall @xcite .",
    "the mafia code package @xcite was used to compute the impedances of various small protrusions for comparison with analytical results .",
    "calculating wakes due to protrusions is a more difficult task for mafia than those due to cavities .",
    "one has to either use a long pipe ( which leads to a huge mesh since it should be homogeneous along the beam path ) , or apply a trick with tapers on the pipe ends .",
    "the tapers make transitions to a new end pipe with radius @xmath35 , so that the new structure looks like a shallow cavity .",
    "the difference of wakes computed with and without a protrusion gives us its contribution .",
    "we used the second approach with pipes from @xmath36 to @xmath37 long and meshes up to @xmath38 points .",
    "simulation results are usually higher than the analytical ones , but go down as a finer mesh is used .",
    "figure  1 gives some comparison for a semisphere .",
    "another practical result that can be derived from the general solution , eqs .",
    "( [ aem])-([i ] ) , is the impedance of a * mask * intended to intercept synchrotron radiation .",
    "we put @xmath39 , so that our model mask has the semicircular shape with radius @xmath29 in its largest transverse cross section . then the integral in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) is reduced to @xmath40 and we further simplify the result for two particular cases .    the first one is the * thin mask * , @xmath24 , in which case @xmath41 , and again it dominates the magnetic term , @xmath42 .",
    "the coupling impedance for such an obstacle  a half - disk of radius @xmath29 and thickness @xmath43 , @xmath24 , transverse to the chamber axis  is therefore @xmath44 \\ , ,         \\label{zm0}\\ ] ] where the next - to - leading term is shown explicitly .    in the opposite limit ,",
    "@xmath45 , which corresponds to a * long * ( along the beam ) * mask * , the leading terms @xmath46 cancel each other . as a result , the impedance of a long mask with length @xmath47 and height @xmath29 , @xmath48 , is @xmath49 which is relatively small due to the `` aerodynamic '' shape of this obstacle , in complete analogy with results for long elliptic slots @xcite .",
    "figure  2 shows the impedance of a mask with a semicircular transverse cross section of radius @xmath29 versus its normalized half - length , @xmath50 . the comparison with the asymptotic approximations eqs .",
    "( [ zm0 ] ) and ( [ zml ] ) is also shown .",
    "one can see that the asymptotic behavior ( [ zml ] ) starts to work well only for very long masks , namely , when @xmath51 .",
    "figure  2 demonstrates that the mask impedance depends rather weakly on the length .",
    "even a very thin mask ( @xmath24 ) contributes as much as @xmath52 times the semisphere ( @xmath53 ) impedance , eq .",
    "( [ zss ] ) , while for long masks the impedance decreases slowly : at @xmath54 , it is still 0.54 of that for the semisphere .    in practice , however , the mask has usually an abrupt cut toward the incident synchrotron radiation , so that it is rather one - half of a long mask .",
    "numerical simulations show that the low - frequency impedances of a semisphere and a half - semisphere of the same depth  which is a relatively short mask  are almost equal ( within the errors ) , and close to that for a longer half - mask . from these results",
    "one can conclude that a good estimate for the mask impedance is given simply by eq .",
    "( [ zss ] ) .",
    "one more interesting observation is that the inductances found numerically for two half - semispheres  one with a cut toward the incident beam and the other , mirrored @xmath55  differ by 3% , while they have to be equal as was proven analytically .",
    "following a similar procedure one can also easily obtain the results for axisymmetric irises having a semi - elliptic profile in the longitudinal chamber cross section , with depth @xmath20 and length @xmath43 along the beam .",
    "for that purpose , one should consider the limit @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) to calculate polarizabilities @xmath57 and @xmath58 per unit length of the circumference of the chamber transverse cross section .",
    "the broad - band impedances of axisymmetric discontinuities have been studied in , and the longitudinal coupling impedance is given by @xmath59 quite similar to eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) . as @xmath56 , the integral @xmath60 , and @xmath61",
    "is expressed in elementary functions as @xmath62 it gives us immediately @xmath63 and the resulting impedance of the iris of depth @xmath29 with the semielliptic profile is simply @xmath64 which proves to be independent of the iris thickness @xmath8 .",
    "the same result has been recently obtained using another , direct method @xcite .",
    "one should emphasize that @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ alax ] ) is just an iris cross - section area ( with negative sign ) , which is correct for any small axisymmetric discontinuity , as was pointed out in .",
    "however , calculating @xmath57 in general is not easy : a conformal mapping was constructed for that purpose in for irises ( as well as for chamber enlargements ) having a trapezoid ( or rectangular , or triangular ) profile .",
    "an interesting fact is that the leading behavior for thin irises of all shapes is exactly the same as eq .",
    "( [ ziris ] ) .",
    "in fact , the same approach can be applied here .",
    "the conformal mapping from the upper half - plane @xmath65 into @xmath66 with the boundary including the iris having a semielliptic profile is given by @xmath67 we need an inverse mapping , but , fortunately , it is enough to find its asymptotic behavior at large @xmath66 and @xmath65 , which is @xmath68 the ratio of the coefficients of the second and first terms on the rhs is @xmath69 , cf .  , which leads us exactly to the result for @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ alax ] ) .",
    "it is even easier for the particular case @xmath32 , when the iris has a semicircular profile of radius @xmath8 .",
    "the explicit conformal mapping for this case is very simple , @xmath70 .",
    "the comparison of the second and first terms on the rhs gives us @xmath71 , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ alax ] ) .",
    "analytical expressions of the impedances for both 3d and axisymmetric small obstacles protruding inside a beam pipe are obtained , and they agree well with numerical results .",
    "these formulas greatly simplify calculations of the broad - band contributions to the coupling impedances from such discontinuities , especially in the 3d case .",
    "the present approach does not work for enlargements of the vacuum chamber .",
    "however , existing analytical results for holes and slots @xcite , as well as for axisymmetric enlargements , cover this case quite well .      99 s.s .",
