    "ramsey s technique of separated oscillatory fields ( sof ) @xcite is widely used in atomic fountain clocks @xcite and other high precision measurements @xcite .",
    "this method is the workhorse for experiments searching for the existence of a permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) in a fundamental particle .",
    "existence of an edm is a signature of time - reversal symmetry violation in the fundamental laws of physics , and limits on edm can serve to validate theories that go beyond the standard model ( which is believed to be incomplete ) .",
    "edm experiments have hence been done in the neutron @xcite ; paramagnetic atoms such as @xmath6cs @xcite and @xmath7tl @xcite ( which imply the existence of an electron edm ) ; diamagnetic atoms such as @xmath8hg @xcite ( which are sensitive to the nuclear schiff moment and time - reversal symmetry violating interactions ) ; etc .",
    "such experiments look for a shift in the ramsey pattern in the presence of an electric field .",
    "laser cooled yb atoms , which have a spin - zero ground state and hence do not require a repumping laser , are prospective candidates for edm experiments @xcite .",
    "a _ continuous _",
    "cold atomic beam has several advantages for these experiments ; and recently we have demonstrated two ways of generating such beams @xcite .",
    "implementation of ramsey s sof technique in such a cold beam of yb atoms is an important requirement for reaching the desired precision in the edm experiment .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate the sof technique in a _",
    "thermal _ beam of yb atoms , as a first step towards implementing it with cold atoms .",
    "the strongly - allowed @xmath1 transition at @xmath2 nm , and the odd isotope @xmath3yb with nuclear spin @xmath4 , are used in the experiment .",
    "@xmath3yb atoms emerging from a thermal source are first optically pumped to the @xmath9 ground sublevel using a @xmath10 pump beam .",
    "the atoms then pass through two rf interaction zones in a region that has a uniform quantization magnetic field that sets the larmor precession frequency .",
    "the rf strength and interaction length of each zone is adjusted to give a @xmath11 pulse for atoms traveling with the mean velocity of 340 m / s .",
    "the two rf zones are separated by @xmath12 mm . the fraction of atoms left in @xmath9 ground sublevel after the second interaction is measured using a @xmath13 probe beam .",
    "the fluorescence signal from the probe as the rf frequency is scanned around the larmor frequency shows a characteristic interference fringe pattern with a central fringe located at @xmath14  khz having a linewidth of @xmath15 hz .",
    "both the lineshape and linewidth agree with the calculated probability of transition _ averaged over the thermal velocity distribution_.",
    "the relevant parts of the set up are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the experiments are done inside a ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber .",
    "the atomic beam is generated by resistively heating a quartz ampoule containing elemental yb to a temperature of about @xmath0c .",
    "the source is not enriched and contains all isotopes in their natural abundances .",
    "the source part is maintained at a pressure of @xmath16 torr by a @xmath17 l / s ion pump .",
    "it is connected to the main experimental chamber consisting of a tube that is @xmath18 mm long with od of @xmath19 mm , sandwiched between ports for optical access .",
    "this part is maintained at a pressure of @xmath20 torr by a @xmath21  l / s ion pump .",
    "there is a differential pumping tube of 5  mm i d @xmath22 @xmath23  mm length between the source and the experimental chamber .",
    "it serves the dual purpose of ( i ) allowing a pressure differential between the two regions , and ( ii ) collimating the atomic beam .",
    "the atomic beam emerging from the differential pumping tube passes through a region with a constant magnetic field @xmath24 in the transverse direction .",
    "this field is produced by a pair of rectangular coils with dimensions @xmath25 mm @xmath22 @xmath26 mm and separated by 160 mm , placed on the outside of the vacuum chamber .",
    "each coil consists of @xmath27 turns of @xmath28 mm thick welding wire wound around four steel rods to provide shape and support .",
    "the coils carry a current @xmath29 a so as to produce a field of about @xmath30 g at the location of the atomic beam .",
    "the required rf fields are produced using two coils wound around the outside of the 42 mm od vacuum tube .",
    "each coil is made using insulated copper wire of @xmath31 mm diameter , and consists of @xmath32 turns in @xmath27 layers .",
    "the physical width of the rf coils is @xmath33 mm and they are separated by @xmath34 mm , as shown in the schematic .",
    "the coils are driven with the output of a function generator amplified by a home - built audio amplifier .",
    "the laser beams needed for the experiment are generated using a grating stabilized diode laser ( toptica dl100 ) , operating with a nichia diode at @xmath2 nm .",
    "the linewidth of the laser after feedback is about 1 mhz , and the total power available is 10 mw .",
    "the laser is locked to a particular magnetic transition ( as described in the * results and discussion * section ) using current modulation at 20 khz .",
    "the pump beam has @xmath35 diameter of @xmath36 mm and power @xmath37 mw , and is @xmath10 polarized .",
    "it is used to spin polarize the unpolarized atoms coming out of the oven , by optically pumping into the @xmath9 ground sublevel .",
    "the probe beam has @xmath35 diameter of @xmath38 mm and power of @xmath23 @xmath39w , and is @xmath13 polarized .",
    "it is used to detect the population left in the @xmath9 sublevel after the second rf interaction .",
    "all signals are fluorescence signals picked up with photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) from hamamatsu ( r928 ) .",
    "the zeeman shift ( in hz ) of a sublevel with a given value of @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 factor of the level , @xmath44 mhz / g is the bohr magneton , and @xmath24 is the magnetic field in g. for the hyperfine level @xmath45 , @xmath42 is given by @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total electronic angular momentum , @xmath48 is the nuclear spin , @xmath49 is the land @xmath43 factor , @xmath50 is the nuclear @xmath43 factor , and @xmath51 is the nuclear magneton .    for the @xmath52 ground state in @xmath3yb , @xmath47 is @xmath53 , so the first term in eq .",
    "is 0 and only the second term contributes .",
    "the nuclear magnetic moment @xmath54 for @xmath3yb is @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "using @xmath56 , the @xmath43 factor for the @xmath57 level is @xmath58 from eq .  , this gives a shift of @xmath59 hz / g for the @xmath60 sublevel .",
    "+ for the excited @xmath61 state , @xmath47 is 1 , so both terms in eq .",
    "are potentially important .",
    "but we can ignore the second term since @xmath62 .",
    "thus the @xmath43 factor for the @xmath63 level is @xmath64 this gives a shift of @xmath65 mhz / g for the @xmath66 sublevel , which is opposite in sign to the ground one because of the opposite signs of the @xmath43 factors .",
    "the splitting of these two levels in a magnetic field of @xmath30 g is shown in fig .",
    "[ levels ] . the ground level splitting gives the larmor precession frequency , so it is @xmath67 khz for this field .",
    "once all the atoms are pumped into the @xmath9 sublevel , there is a probability @xmath68 that they have made a transition to the @xmath69 sublevel after interacting with the two rf fields .",
    "if the two rf zones have a length @xmath70 and are separated by a distance @xmath71 ; a particular atom has a velocity @xmath72 ; and the rf field has a strength @xmath73 ( its rabi frequency ) and its oscillation frequency is detuned from resonance by @xmath74 ; the transition probability is given by @xcite , @xmath75 ^ 2   \\label{prob } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the effective rabi frequency . since the atoms emanate from a thermal source , the beam consists of atoms with the following longitudinal velocity distribution @xcite @xmath77 so that @xmath78 is the number of atoms with velocity between @xmath72 and @xmath79 .",
    "the total probability @xmath80 in an atomic beam is thus the probability for one velocity given in eq .   averaged over the velocity distribution given by eq .  .",
    "hence @xmath81 since in the experiment we detect the population that has stayed in the @xmath9 sublevel , the fluorescence signal is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "the calculated probability is compared to the observed signal in the next section .",
    "for the optical pumping to work effectively , the pump laser needs to be locked as close to the @xmath83 transition in @xmath3yb ( see fig .  [ levels ] ) as possible .",
    "but this is not as straightforward as it seems because of the presence of the overlapping peak from the even isotope @xmath84yb",
    ". this will affect the lock point significantly because the two peaks are partially resolved , as seen from the no field spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ lock](a ) .",
    "this problem can be solved by using a magnetic field to shift the sublevels , and using circularly polarized light so that only a subset of transitions are allowed .",
    "but with @xmath13 polarized light , this still leads to an issue because the final spectrum has two peaks , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ lock](b ) . on the other hand , with @xmath10 polarized light ,",
    "there is only one peak , as seen in fig .",
    "[ lock](b ) .",
    "this peak is actually an unresolved peak containing both the @xmath85 transition in @xmath3yb and the @xmath86 transition in @xmath84yb , but the presence of this additional transition is unimportant because optical pumping only requires the pump laser to be on the correct transition .",
    "this is one of the main reasons for choosing @xmath10 polarization for the pump beam .",
    "the experimentally observed ramsey pattern is compared to the theoretical calculation in fig .",
    "[ fringes ] .",
    "the theoretical calculation is done according to the procedure discussed in the previous section .",
    "the coil length @xmath70 and the free evolution distance @xmath71 are adjusted to get a good fit .",
    "the geometrical dimensions are @xmath87 mm and @xmath88 mm ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) , whereas the best fit is obtained with values of 40 mm and 400 mm .",
    "this increase in @xmath70 ( and corresponding decrease in @xmath71 ) is reasonable because of the fringing fields from the coils extending beyond their physical edge , and the fact that their mean diameter is much larger than the size of atomic beam . changing the oven temperature [ which determines the velocity distribution in eq .  ]",
    "has negligible effect on the calculation , and it is left at @xmath0c .",
    "as seen in the figure , the lineshapes for theory and experiment match quite well .",
    "the central fringe is located at @xmath14 khz corresponding to a magnetic field of 22.2 g , which is in good agreement with the value calculated from the coil dimensions .",
    "the linewidth for the central fringe in both theory and experiment is about @xmath15 hz .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated ramsey s sof technique in a thermal beam of yb atoms emanating from an oven at @xmath0c .",
    "the experiment was done on the @xmath89 transition at @xmath2 nm , and using the isotope @xmath3yb which has @xmath4 and hence just two magnetic sublevels in the ground state . using a quantization field of 22.2 g , we obtain a linewidth of @xmath15 hz at 16.64 khz for the central fringe in the ramsey pattern .",
    "the line shape and width agree with the theoretically calculated transition probability , after averaging over the thermal velocity distribution .",
    "we now plan to implement this in a cold atomic beam , as demonstrated by us in earlier work @xcite . in that case",
    ", the beam consisted of atoms traveling with a mean velocity of 15 m / s at a longitudinal temperature of 40 mk . to see the improvement that is likely , we have repeated the calculation for this temperature .",
    "the values of @xmath24 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are left unchanged , only the rf strength is adjusted to provide a @xmath11 pulse for atoms traveling at 15 m / s .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "note that the scan range is only 1 khz , which is 16 times smaller than for the previous one",
    ". the number of fringes has increased , and there is a dramatic decrease in linewidth of the central fringe from 350 hz to 15 hz .",
    "this illustrates the advantage of using a cold beam for edm experiments .",
    "this work was supported by the department of science and technology , india , through the swarnajayanti fellowship .",
