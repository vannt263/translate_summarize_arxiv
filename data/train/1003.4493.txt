    "this is required to ensure that the floer cohomology groups that we are considering are independent of the auxiliary choices .",
    "similarly , to avoid disk bubbles , recall that by the real - analyticity of the seams , any disk bubble in a quilted map can be seen as disk bubble in @xmath433 with boundary on @xmath434 for some @xmath76 .",

    "therefore , these considerations imply that the floer cohomology groups are well - defined .",
    "furthermore , the negative monotonicity assumption gives an area - index relation as before , which guarantees a priori energy bound on the moduli space @xmath431 , hence gromov - floer compactness applies . since we excluded the possibility of the sphere and disk bubbled configurations in the compactification of the moduli spaces @xmath397 and @xmath398 , to finish off the only remaining issue is to exclude the bubbling at the y - end .",
    "we will follow the notation given in the proof of theorem [ positive ] .",

    "in theorem 25 of @xcite , the first author proves an isomorphism of floer groups associated with @xmath472 where @xmath103 is a closed 3manifold with @xmath473 and @xmath474 is a circle valued morse function with connected fibres and no maxima or minima .",
    "such an @xmath474 is called a _ broken fibration _ in @xcite , which we adopt here .",
    "we will denote by @xmath475 and @xmath476 two fixed regular fibres which have maximal genus @xmath477 and minimal genus @xmath16 among fibres of @xmath474 .",
    "we also write @xmath478 for the set of spin@xmath479 structures @xmath480 on @xmath103 , which satisfy @xmath481 .    in the proof of this isomorphism ,",
    "an important step is an application of theorem [ isomorphism ] , which was available through the work of wehrheim and woodward in @xcite .",
    "however , in an early version of @xcite before theorem [ negative ] was available , the author needed to assume a technical condition , namely that one needs to have a removal of singularity property for the _ figure - eight bubbles _ , which is needed in order to extend the proof of wehrheim and woodward in @xcite to this setting .",
    "while this property is yet to be proved ( or disproved ) , theorem [ isomorphism ] , more precisely its extension to the strongly negative case given in theorem [ negative ] in this paper enables us to drop this technical assumption in theorem 25 of @xcite .",
    "therefore , we finally have the desired form of this theorem as follows :      once we have theorem [ negative ] and the results obtained in @xcite , the proof of this result is a matter of verifying that the lagrangian correspondences and symplectic manifolds involved in the definition of above groups satisfy hypothesis of theorem [ isomorphism ] . for this purpose , we briefly recall the definitions of the groups @xmath485 and @xmath486 .",
    "we remark that the hypothesis @xmath482 is required for the group @xmath487 to be well - defined . without this assumption",
    ", we do not know how to avoid the possibility of disk bubbles . on the other hand",

    "we also choose an almost complex structure @xmath492 on @xmath491 which agrees with @xmath493 outside a neighborhood of @xmath237 .",
    "this is a canonical construction in the sense that the parameter space is contractible .",

    "the symplectic forms @xmath26 and @xmath507 on the two spaces are are khler forms in the respective cohomology class @xmath508 , where @xmath509 is a common parameter .    the correspondence is obtained as a vanishing cycle for a symplectic degeneration of @xmath494 .",
    "one first considers a holomorphic lefschetz fibration @xmath510 over @xmath511 with regular fibre @xmath98 and just one vanishing cycle , isotopic to @xmath237 ; thus @xmath237 collapses , in the fibre over the origin , to a nodal curve @xmath512 .",
    "the correspondence @xmath513 arises from the vanishing cycle of the relative hilbert scheme of @xmath514 points associated with this lefschetz fibration .",
    "furthermore , perutz proves that the correspondences @xmath504 are canonically determined up to hamiltonian isotopy @xcite .    using perutz s constructions , in @xcite the first author defined the group @xmath515 . given a @xmath60manifold @xmath103 and a broken fibration @xmath516 , the _ quilted floer homology _ of @xmath103 ,",
    "@xmath517 is a quilted floer homology of the cyclic set of lagrangian correspondences associated with @xmath474 and a @xmath518 structure on @xmath103 obtained by the perutz s construction above .",
    "more specifically , we will restrict our attention to broken fibrations @xmath474 which have connected fibres and the genera of the fibres are in decreasing order as one travels clockwise and counter - clockwise from @xmath519 to @xmath396 .",
    "as before , we denote by @xmath520 a genus @xmath477 surface identified with the fibre above @xmath519 and by @xmath521 a genus @xmath16 surface identified with the fibre above @xmath396 . on @xmath475 , we denote by @xmath522 , the disjoint attaching circles of the two handles corresponding to the critical points of @xmath474 above the northern semi - circle , and similarly we have disjoint attaching circles @xmath523 for the critical points of @xmath474 above the southern semi - circle .",
    "let @xmath524 and @xmath525 be critical values of @xmath474 in the northern and southern semicircle respectively . now , pick points @xmath526 in a small neighborhood of each critical point @xmath527 so that the fibre genus increases from @xmath528 ( resp .",

    "the fact that these complex structures achieve transversality is standard , see proposition a.5 of @xcite for an argument in a related set - up .",

    ", we need to recall the calculations of @xcite to verify the assumptions ( 4 ) in theorem [ negative ] .",
    "the area - index relation follows from lemma 4.17 in @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the construction of the lagrangian correspondences @xmath557 and @xmath558 one can choose `` strongly admissible '' degenerations to ensure that two trajectories with the same index and the same asymptotic limits have the same area .",
    "this is a consequence of monotonicity proved in lemma 4.17 of @xcite which implies that there is a well - defined action functional that is @xmath559-valued .",
    "( alternatively , one can work in `` balanced '' , i.e. `` weakly admissible '' setting , as in @xcite which requires adaptation of the proof of the main theorem to cover this case .",
    "we think that this is straightforward but we do not check this here ) .",
    "next , in order to ensure _ strongly _ negative monotonicity condition , that is assumptions ( 5 ) in theorem [ negative ] , we need to verify that the index of holomorphic spheres and disks are sufficiently negative as stated in the assumptions of theorem [ negative ] .",
    "we show next that this follows from the assumption that @xmath482 .",
    "note that the symplectic manifolds that we are dealing with are @xmath560 where @xmath561 and @xmath562 takes values between @xmath563 and @xmath564 .",
    "we equip @xmath27 with a symplectic form in the class @xmath565 where @xmath509 is a fixed parameter that is determined by the monotonicity condition as follows :        now , perutz calculates in section 4 of @xcite that the hurewicz map @xmath569 has rank @xmath396 and generated by a class @xmath570 which satisfies @xmath571 and @xmath572 . on the other hand , @xmath573 .",
