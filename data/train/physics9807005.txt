    "the calculation of the equation of state ( eos ) of a multi - component quantum plasma consisting of charged particles interacting via the coloumb potential is of theoretical interest as well as of practical relevance , e.g. , for astrophysical systems such as stars .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive a low - density expansion for the equation of state ( eos ) of a two - component plasma embedded in an external constant magnetic field .",
    "this problem was recently tackled by cornu @xcite and boose&perez who derived a formally exact virial expansion of the eos by using a formalism which is based on the feynman - kac path - integral representation of the grand - canonical potential .    in this paper we will employ the method of green s function . as the calculations are carried out for a nonrelativistic quantum system",
    ", we restrict ourselves to magnetic field strengths @xmath4 which is given by @xmath5.further we will use an expansion of the magnetized plasma pressure in terms of the fugacity @xmath6 to obtain the eos of a weakly coupled magnetized plasma . thus we can derive explicit expressions for various contributions to the quantum second virial coefficient . though the formalism is formally valid only for low densities the obtained explicit expressions are appropriate even at sufficient high densities as the magnetic field increases the domain of classical behavior towards higher densities .",
    "the second virial coefficient contains both scattering and bound state contributions of two - particle states .",
    "being interested in the thermodynamic properties of quantum magnetized plasmas the influence of the magnetic field on the energy eigen states of a two - particle states has to be taken into account .",
    "usually the magnetic field is measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electron cyclotron energy , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the ionization energy of the field - free hydrogen atom . whenever @xmath11 , i.e. the cyclotron energy is larger than the typical coulomb energy , the structure of the hydrogen atom is dramatically changed .",
    "this problem has been approached by several authors . using the results of these authors we study the influence of bound and scattering states on thermodynamic properties of magnetized plasmas .",
    "recently the problem of ionization equilibrium of hydrogen atoms in superstrong magnetic fields ( @xmath12 ) was considered by lai&salpeter .",
    "they proposed an ideal saha equation of a hydrogen gas including bound states but neglecting screening effects and scattering contributions to the second virial coefficient . using the eos obtained in our derivation",
    "we construct a modified saha equation which takes into account nonideality effects as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the method which is used to calculate thermodynamic functions and derive analytical results for the scattering contribution in section iii .",
    "an approximate result for the bound state contributions is given in section iv and the equation of state is presented in section v. finally , we use our results to derive a generalized saha equation and compare the degree of ionization with the results of the ideal saha equation in section vi .",
    "we consider a two - component charge - symmetrical system of n spin half particles of charge ( -e ) and mass @xmath13 and n spin half particles of charge e and mass @xmath14 .",
    "in general , the total pressure can be split into ideal contributions and interaction contributions @xmath15 the pressure and the particle density of an ideal plasma in a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath16 are given by a sum of fermi integrals over all landau levels n @xmath17 ( @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21}$ ] ) .",
    "the prime indicates the double summation due to the spin degeneracy except for the @xmath22 level .",
    "the interaction part of the pressure for sufficiently strong decaying potentials may be written in terms of a fugacity expansion @xmath23 where we have introduced the modified fugacities @xmath24 in the limit of small densities we have @xmath25 .",
    "we focus on the calculation of the second virial coefficient @xmath26 which is defined by @xmath27 @xmath28 is the hamiltonoperator of the two particle system with the interaction potential @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the noninteracting system .",
    "the additive term @xmath32 describes the coupling between the intrinsic magnetic moment ( @xmath33 ) of the charged particles and the magnetic field .",
    "however , in the case of particles interacting via the coulomb potential @xmath34 the second virial coefficient defined by eqs.([nd6],[nd75 ] ) is divergent . in order to obtain a convergent expression",
    "one has to perform a screening procedure .",
    "such a technique is well established in the zero magnetic field case and can be easily extended to the nonzero magnetic field case .",
    "this program was also carried out by cornu @xcite and boose&perez who used the feynman - kac formalism to derive a virial expansion for a magnetized multi - component system . using the methods",
    "as described in the convergent second virial coefficient of a plasma may be split into a scattering and bound state contribution .",
    "in contrast to the zero magnetic field case an exact calculation of the convergent second virial coefficient in terms of scattering phase shifts is very complicated",
    ". therefore we will give a perturbation expansion of the scattering part in terms of the interaction parameter @xmath35 up to the order @xmath36 and use an approximate expression for the bound state part which is valid in the case of strong magnetic fields ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we may employ the method of green s function .",
    "the starting point is the observation that the equation of state is connected to the average interaction energy @xmath38 by a charging process @xmath39 @xmath40 is the volume of the system .",
    "taking into account many body effects thermodynamic functions may be expressed by a screened potential @xmath41 . by this method",
    "the divergencies due to the long range coulomb force are removed .",
    "then the pressure is given by the equation @xmath42 here the first term is the hartree approximation given in terms of the free particle green s function @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the polarization function . for low density systems",

    "we may divide @xmath48 into a bound state contribution @xmath49 and a scattering state contribution @xmath50 @xmath51 in the case of a coloumb potential this division is not trivial as the atomic partition function is divergent due to the infinite number of bound states at the continuum boundary .",
    "this problem has been extensively discussed in the zero magnetic field case @xcite .",
    "one can solve this problem in a natural way by introducing a renormalized sum of bound states @xmath52 where at zero magnetic field @xmath53 is given by the planck - larkin partition function @xcite .",

    "the prime denotes the particular choice of the gauge . both @xmath65 and @xmath66",

    "noting that @xmath69 is only a function of @xmath70 and that it obeys the relation @xmath71 , this factor can be left aside in the following calculations .",
    "first we calculate the hartree - fock term , which can be written in space time representation as @xmath72 the free particle green s function @xmath73 must now be replaced by eq.([3134 ] ) . in the resulting expression",
    "all integrals can be computed exactly .",
    "the detailed calculation is given in appendix a. defining @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 being the effectiv mass , we obtain the result @xmath77 where we have introduced @xmath78      next we investigate the direct term of order @xmath36 given by the following expression @xmath79 again , a detailed calculation may be found in appendix b. retaining only contributions of order @xmath80 we obtain the result @xmath81 where @xmath82 may be written as , @xmath83 with @xmath84 . the first term in eq.([mwt88 ] )",

    "finally , we note that this equation gives in the limit @xmath93 the exact zero magnetic field results ( see @xcite ) .",
    "according to eq.([nd8 ] ) we have for the bound state contribution @xmath94 where @xmath95 are the eigenvalues of @xmath96 . in eq.([2.1.1 ] ) all terms up to the order @xmath36 with respect to the interaction parameter must be omitted . in order to calculate @xmath49",
    "the precise knowledge of the binding energies is essential .",
    "therefore we briefly review the energy spectrum of the bound states and specify the approximations used in this paper .",
    "in contrast to the field - free hydrogen atom there is no exact solution for the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom at abritrary magnetic field strength .",
    "we focus on the astrophysical interesting strong field regime @xmath12 . here",

    "the two - body problem has been investigated in the pseudomomentum approach .",

    "lai&salpeter proposed an effective mass @xmath118 approximation of the transverse moving atom with @xmath119 which we will use for simplification for all m - states .",
    "this energy correction is only valid for small pseudomomentum @xmath120 where @xmath121 is defined by @xmath122 but serves as a fair approximation for magnetic fields strengths @xmath123 .",
    "we note that due to the coupling of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton with the magnetic field an additional factor of @xmath124 arises in the bound state partition function . on the other hand , at magnetic fields @xmath12 and temperatures",
    "@xmath125 k spin excitations of the electrons can be neglected .",
    "given the energy eigenvalues we can define a convergent expression for the atomic partition function .",
    "the operator @xmath46 can be taken into account by subtracting the lowest order contributions with respect to the interaction parameter .",
    "as in the zero magnetic field case @xcite one can define a planck - larkin partition function @xmath126 here , the factor 2 has its origin in the near - degeneracy of the hydrogen - like eigenstates .",
    "one can simplify the results by integrating over the pseudomomentum @xmath98",
    "@xmath127    now we can rewrite eq.([2.1.1 ] ) . by using the eigenvalues @xmath128 ( [ 3.1 ] ) and by introducing the modified fugacities @xmath129 according to eq.([nd6 ] ) we arrive at the following expression for the bound state contribution to the second virial coefficient @xmath130 @xmath131 and @xmath132 are given by eq.([3.5 ] ) and eq.([3.2 ] ) , the energy eigenvalues @xmath108 by eq.([3.3 ] ) and eq.([3.4 ] ) , respectively .",
    "now we can sum up all contributions we have considered . according to eqs.([2.a.2],[mwt88],[2.c.1],[3.7 ] ) and expanding the ideal contribution in terms of the modified fugacities up to the order @xmath80",
    "the pressure reads as follows @xmath133 the chemical potential in eq.([4.2 ] ) can be eliminated by using the relation @xmath134 to obtain the equation of state for a magnetized plasma .",
    "this procedure has been carried out numerically and the results are given in fig .",
    "1 .    eqs.([4.2],[4.21 ] ) describe the ionization equilibrium of a weakly coupled hydrogen plasma in strong magnetic fields in an implicite form .",
    "the effect of the nonideality ( i.e. of the scattering states contribution ) of the plasma is to reduce the pressure .",
    "this contribution dominates the bound states contribution at high temperatures while at low temperatures the bound state term is dominant .",
    "independent of the nonideality of the system we may also characterize the pressure by the magnetic field strength . for @xmath135",
    "the pressure decreases with increasing magnetic field strength , while for @xmath136 the pressure increases as the magnetic field increases .",
    "this can be explained by the domination of the lowering of the ground state energy with increasing magnetic field strength at low temperatures , while at high temperatures the decrease of the phase space volume dominates .    in order to give a more explicit representation of the ionization equilibrium",
    "we will derive a generalized saha equation in the next section .",
    "in previous treatments of this problem the interaction between the charged particles has been neglected .",
    "but at high densities considered here interactions between the particles play an important role .",
    "our method is based on the chemical picture in which bound states are considered as composite particles , which must be treated on the same footing as elementary particles . by inspection of the fugacity expansion ( [ 4.1 ] ) we reinterpret the term containing the partition function @xmath132 as the fugacity @xmath137 of the neutral atoms    @xmath138    defining the fugacities of the free composite particles in the chemical picture by @xmath139 the pressure reads as follows @xmath140 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 is given by @xmath143 the particle densities of the new species are given by @xmath144 solving this equation by iteration we find @xmath145 where now @xmath146 . by inserting the fugacities according to eq.([5.6 ] ) into eq.([5.1 ] ) the following saha equation is obtained @xmath147 where @xmath148 is to be taken from eq.([2.d.2 ] ) and ( [ 5.2.1 ] ) .",
    "it is useful to extend the range of validity of eq.([5.7 ] ) for large @xmath149 by a kind of pad approximation . noting that @xmath150 where @xmath151 may interpreted as an effective radius of the charged particles and is defined by @xmath152 we find the modified saha equation @xmath153 the eq.([5.8 ] ) differs from the saha equation given in by an additional exponential factor which may be interpreted as the lowering of the ionization energy . in fig .",
    "2 the degree of ionization @xmath154 for a dense hydrogen plasma at various magnetic field strengths is plotted and compared with the results of the ideal saha equation .",
    "we find an increase of the ionization degree in comparison with the ideal saha equation due to the nonideality effects .",
    "for densities of about @xmath155 the deviation from the ideal saha equation may be as large as 10 - 15% ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . at even higher densities ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath156 , this result may only be used as a rough approximation .",
    "the plasma can no longer be regarded as a weakly coupled system rather it must be treated as a strongly coupled system .",
    "additionally , we may characterize the dependence of the ionization degree on the magnetic field strength .",
    "with increasing magnetic field strength the ionization degree decreases at temperatures @xmath135 , while for temperatures @xmath136 the ionization degree increases .",
    "the explanation of this effect was given in section v.",
    "in this paper we constructed a theory describing a hydrogen plasma in a constant uniform magnetic field .",
    "starting from a fugacity expansion we derived a general expression for the second virial coefficient as a perturbation expansion with respect to the interaction parameter @xmath35 and we explicitly calculated the lowest order contributions for the scattering part and considered bound state contributions at arbitrary order by using the approximate results for the binding energy of lai&salpeter .",
    "the results were used to establish the equation of state .",
    "finally , we have derived a generalized saha equation and we have shown that at high densities and at temperatures typical for the surface of neutron stars nonideality effects can significantly increase the degree of ionization .    the accuracy of the absolute values of the considered physical quantities can be improved by using more accurate energy eigenvalues , i.e. better fitting formulas , and by calculating even higher order contributions to the scattering part of the second virial coefficient . nevertheless , the influence of the nonideality effects on the ionization equilibrium as shown in this paper remains approximately the same .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft under grant#eb 126/5 - 1 .",
    "by using the representation of the green s function in terms of the spectral function ( eq.([3136 ] ) ) we obtain for the hartree - fock term @xmath157 in order to fulfill the periodicity condition of the green s function every time variable must be extended in the complex time region",
