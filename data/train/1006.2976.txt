    "according to renormalization group theory , the scaling properties of critical systems are insensitive to microscopic details and are governed by a small set of universal exponents  @xcite .",
    "also polymers can be considered as critical systems in the limit where their length @xmath1 ( the number of chained monomers ) diverges  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the radius of gyration of an isolated polymer in a swollen phase scales as @xmath6 , where @xmath7  @xcite in @xmath8 dimensions is a universal critical exponent .",
    "one of the simplest models in the universality class of swollen polymers is that of self - avoiding walks ( saws ) on a lattice .",

    "knots in polymers have attracted a lot of attention during the past years , also because of their occurrence in biopolymers as dnas , rnas and proteins  @xcite . as usual , saws represent a minimal effective model to grasp the essential , coarse - grained features of polymer chains .",
    "simulations of knotted saps in ensembles with fixed topology are performed with a grand - canonical algorithm ( bfacf  @xcite , from the name of the authors ) tuned to span a range of chain lengths ( algorithms with fixed @xmath16 are not ergodic in this case ) .",
    "for this algorithm , the tuning of step fugacities to @xmath17 is necessary to achieve samplings of long chains",

    "there are several reasons for studying this model . on the theoretical side ,",
    "it can be considered as an enhanced saw : besides sharing critical exponents with saws , its fluctuating length enables new avenues to estimate critical exponents .",
    "elps have been used in studies of polymer dynamics as phase separation in polymer melts @xcite , or in translocation through nanopores @xcite , but their equilibrium properties have so far received little attention .",

    "this case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp](c ) .",
    "the three intersection points are a central local minimum of the entropy enclosed by two local maxima .",
    "the probability distribution of lengths is like that depicted as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_new](a ) .",
    "it is easy to see that if the total number of monomers decreases ( this corresponds to shift one of the two @xmath138 s along the horizontal axis ) there will be only one intersection point .",

    "@xcite , which would instead correspond to a convex ( i.e. with a minimum in the middle ) shape .",
    "the non - monotonicity in @xmath0 of the stored - length density @xmath5 explains this drastic change in behavior in finite - size data .    to complete the discussion we consider next an example where no intersection point is present ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp](d ) ) .",
    "in this case one has to resort to the full form of @xmath131 : from the scaling of partition functions of saps , the probability of a state with @xmath0 monomers on the side with no knots is expected to scale as @xmath140 with a cutoff at @xmath141 .",
    "it implies that the average length of the unknotted subchain @xmath142 is weakly scaling with @xmath16 , and at least in this case the competition is clearly in favor of the side with knots .",
    "this reminds us that the full statistics given by @xmath131 would often be necessary to compute average quantities , and that the maxima are only indicative elements .",
    "nevertheless , we have seen that the density of stored length is a useful quantity for understanding the basic properties of the entropy of competing knotted chains . in particular , knowing it and its short-@xmath16 features helps to interpret the numerical results and to distinguish preasymptotic scalings from asymptotic ones .",
    "let us finally go back and reconsider briefly the entropic competition of knots divided by a wall , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch](a ) .",
    "the main difference is that the basic exponent of the unknotted chain should be @xmath143 . the additional index @xmath144 is connected to the constraint of having a monomer of a loop confined close to a hard surface .",
    "the formula is an application of duplantier s general theory of polymer networks  @xcite .",
    "we use this theory also to extract @xmath144 from the data in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtaining @xmath145 .",
    "this means that @xmath146 .",
    "again the full zoology of possible competitions could be simply discussed by repeating the above reasoning , once data of @xmath5 for elps close to a wall are generated .",
    "we reserve this investigation for a future work .",
    "let us just note that the condition @xmath147 , associated with a single maximum of the entropy @xmath131 at @xmath148 , is now met for a minimal number of prime knots @xmath149 per loop , i.e.  one more than we needed in the case without the wall .",
    "thus , the wall separating the chains has somewhat the effect of repelling entropically also the knots .",
    "in this paper we studied the scaling properties of a class of polymers , which we have referred to as elastic lattice polymers ( elps ) .",
    "these polymers can accumulate stored length along their backbone , by lifting the self - avoidance condition for neighboring monomers .",
    "the length @xmath1 of their backbone fluctuates , whereas the total number of monomers @xmath0 is fixed . differently from true grand canonical polymers , however , the backbone length is bounded to @xmath150 , and fluctuates around @xmath20 with fluctuations @xmath151 .",
    "elps were used in the past to study the dynamics of polymer melts @xcite and pore translocation dynamics @xcite , but their equilibrium behavior has received little attention . in this work , we used elps to investigate entropic exponents of knotted polymer rings .",
    "the calculation of polymer entropic exponents from classical monte carlo simulations of canonical self - avoiding rings is rather cumbersome : one has either to employ complex grand canonical sampling , or to resort to the so - called atmospheres method @xcite or entropic competition methods @xcite .",
    "elps are well suited to this type of problem .",
    "firstly , the underlying monte carlo dynamics can be based solely on local moves ( thus conserving the knot topology ) and the possibility of accumulating length along the backbone facilitates the sampling of different configurations compared to canonical self - avoiding rings .",
    "the elp explores new configurations through sliding moves along the backbone .",
    "secondly , we have shown that there is a natural variable associated to elps which is the stored length density @xmath5 ( see eq .",

    "we have derived an expansion for @xmath5 in the limit @xmath152 , where @xmath5 converges to a value that depends on the connectivity constant of the ordinary lattice polymers .",
    "the next leading behavior is of the order @xmath21 , with @xmath4 the entropic exponent of the polymers .",
    "this allows one to estimate entropic exponents from the scaling analysis of @xmath5 . as examples of application of this",
    ", we estimated entropic exponents of swollen polymers in @xmath87 and @xmath8 , and of polymers with various types of knots . comparing the results with conjectured values of these exponents",
    ", we find a clear agreement at least for the simplest knot studied .",
    "for more complex knots the agreement is only marginal , due to finite - size effects quickly increasing with the knot complexity .",
    "one of the advantages of the stored length analysis is that correction - to - scaling effects are directly visible in @xmath5 vs. @xmath48 plots as they appear as deviations from a linear scaling behavior .",
    "our analysis showed that finite - size effects become stronger with the knot complexity and with the number of knots .",
    "similar result have been observed by janse van rensburg and rechnitzer  @xcite .",
    "these authors estimated the connectivity constant and entropic exponent of lattice polymers via the atmosphere method  @xcite , where , roughly speaking , atmospheres are the loci where the polymer can be expanded and contracted .",
    "interestingly , there is a similarity between the scaling of the average atmospheres and that of the stored - length density of elps discussed in this paper .    with simulations of elps we have shown how important are corrections to scaling in the statistics of knotted polymers : their equilibrium properties in entropic competition can be understood from coexistence diagrams of stored lengths of elps .",
    "the non - monotonicity of the stored length density as function of @xmath153 explains some features of the competing rings observed in canonical monte carlo simulations @xcite which were poorly understood before .    summarizing ,",
    "the elastic lattice polymer is a simple model sharing critical exponents with the self - avoiding walk , but it has an additional `` elastic '' degree of freedom in its fluctuating length , which offers numerical advantages and additional theoretical tools to derive critical exponents of polymers .",

    "<S> however , if knots are present , we observe strong corrections to scaling , which help to understand how an entropic competition between knots is affected by the finite length of the chain . </S>"
