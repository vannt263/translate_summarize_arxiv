    "the technical challenges are : 1 ) diagonalizing the single - particle hamilton  ( [ bulgac_eq : ks_1 ] ) ; 2 ) solving the self - consistency equations to determine stationary ( ground state ) configurations ; and 3 ) stably and self - consistently evolving the single - particle states  ( [ bulgac_eq : kd_td ] ) to describe the dynamics .",
    "typically one applies all three techniques , first solving for an initial stationary configuration , then driving the system to explore the dynamics  stirring to generate vortices for example .",

    "it must be considered when considering time - dependence to ensure that the energy density is covariant under local galilean transformations . in nuclear physics",
    "galilean invariance have been considered for quite some time  @xcite , and the contribution of these currents is often essential for describing the properties of excited states",
    ". it is easily demonstrated ( see  @xcite for details ) that when changing to a frame with velocity @xmath48 , the currents and kinetic densities transform as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the bare mass of the particles .",

    "we do this by matching the predictions of the functional in the thermodynamic limit to accurate calculations .",
    "fitting the energy and quasiparticle spectrum determines the following values for the unitary gas ( see  @xcite for a detailed discussion of this fitting procedure ) : @xmath70 the satisfies all expected conservation laws : energy in the absence of time - dependent fields , linear / angular momentum if the corresponding symmetries are not broken , gauge and galilean invariance , and particle number in the absence of applied external pairing fields .",

    "a memory limited implementation of broyden s method  @xcite works well to accelerate convergence , thereby determining equilibrium configurations to use as an initial state for a subsequent time - dependent simulation .",
    "the output of this is a complete set of wavefunctions , typically represented on a periodic lattice .",
    "these are then fed into the time dependence equations  ( [ bulgac_eq : kd_td ] ) to generate the time - dependent states @xmath71 .",
    "note that at each time - step , the hamiltonian must be updated to reflect the current ensemble of states .",

    "periodic lattices enable us to use the to efficiently transform the wave functions between position and momentum space so that the kinetic and potential parts of the hamiltonian may be applied by simple multiplication .",
    "this allows us to perform fully three - dimensional simulations .",
    "if one has an exact density functional , then the technique can be shown to deliver the exact time - evolution of the one - body density  @xcite .",
    "if one is interested in higher - order operators , however , then extensions to the technique are required  @xcite .",
    "these are significantly more costly , but still within computational reach for carefully chosen problems .",
    "the main limitation is that an exact density functional is not known .",
    "thus , the requires careful benchmarking to determine the domain of validity . at present ,",
    "the has been formulated and fit using calculations of the @xmath72 thermodynamic limit of the three - dimensional unitary fermi gas .",
    "this has been benchmarked against trapped systems to an accuracy of a few percent  @xcite , indicating that the omitted gradient corrections are quite small .",
    "thus , the is reliable for cold symmetric systems up to small gradients corrections .",
    "the asymmetric extension ( the ) has also been formulated and fit to data .",
    "the extension to finite - temperatures is still an open problem .",
    "the subsumes the usual mean - field equations , but extends these considerably .",
    "for example , it includes a self - energy contribution that is neglected in the zero - range limit of the mean - field equations .",
    "the lacks the variational property of the mean - field equations , but with careful validation , has the ability to provide a much more quantitatively accurate description of fermionic superfluids  @xcite .",
    "we present here briefly two quite spectacular results obtained using the in a unitary gas .",
    "we prepare a system in its ground state in an axially symmetric trap ( with an essentially flat bottom ) and homogeneous with periodic boundary conditions in the third direction .",
    "we then adiabatically introduce two types of quantum stirrers : 1 ) a spherical projectile flying along the symmetry axis with a speed @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the fermi velocity ) ; and 2 ) a rod parallel to the symmetry axis with a diametrically opposed sphere ( breaking translational invariance along the tube ) moving with a constant angular velocity about the center of the tube and a linear velocity lower than the critical velocity of the unitary fermi gas @xmath75  @xcite . in the first case , the spherical projectile , after passing through the system , generates a rather elusive excitation mode of a superfluid : a vortex ring . in the second case , the two quantum stirrers ( the rod and the sphere ) generate five vortices .",
    "the sphere breaks the translational symmetry , exciting kelvin modes along the vortices , and , at the same time , exciting phonons in the superfluid to form a complicated mixture of dynamical modes . in each of these simulations",
    "we solved about time - dependent 3d coupled nonlinear partial differential equations on a @xmath76 spatial lattice for a sufficiently long period of time .",
    "even though we have only illustrated the in the case of a unitary fermi gas , this is a rather general approach suitable to describe the dynamics of virtually any fermionic superfluid with @xmath39-wave pairing .",
    "the has already been used to describe nuclear systems : in particular , the first attempt to describe induced nuclear fission was recently performed .",
    "although not yet explored , it appears that the extension to pairing in other partial waves ( @xmath77-wave and @xmath78-wave for example ) is straightforward .",
