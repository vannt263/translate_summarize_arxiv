    "despite the fact that many real spin glasses , like @xmath5 , are heisenberg like systems , the very existence of a finite temperature transition in three dimensions seems to be ruled out for systems with short range interactions @xcite .",
    "simulations of a model with long range rkky interactions are compatible with the system being at its lower critical dimension @xcite .",
    "a possible way out of the puzzle has been the consideration of anisotropy .",
    "matsubara et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that even a small amount of anisotropy in the hamiltonian is enough for having a spin glass phase at low temperatures .",
    "the previous models @xcite are of the class with _ bond disorder_. a finite temperature transition was also found in an isotropic _ site diluted _ model with rkky interactions @xcite . more recently , coluzzi @xcite have found evidence for a finite temperature transition in the four dimensional bond disordered lattice with nearest neighbour interactions ( nni ) .",
    "consequently the lower critical dimension for the model with nni would be between three and four .",
    "in this letter we address the problem of the spin glass transition in heisenberg systems putting enphasis in the connectivy structure of the lattice rather than the dimension .",
    "in fact , the coordination number in the real three dimensional space may not be six for an amorphous system , as forced by the hypercubic lattice geometry .",
    "instead , we have studied a model in which @xmath6 spins are placed in the vertices of a _ d _ dimensional _ hipercubic cell _ of side 2 so that the size of the system is @xmath7 and where each spin interacts with its _ d _ nearest neighbors .",
    "this model has been introduced by parisi _",
    "@xcite who studied the static properties of ising spin glasses and the approach to mean field behaviour that is expected when @xmath8 .",
    "note that in this geometry _",
    "d _ is not the dimension of real space but defines the connectivity structure of the system . from the point of view of the connectivity the behaviour of the _ hipercubic cell _ in dimension _",
    "d _ has to be compared with that of the _ hipercubic lattice _ in _",
    "d/2 _ dimensions . for an heisenberg system",
    "the spins interact through the hamiltonian : @xmath9 the vector spins @xmath10 have components @xmath11 and are normalized in the unit sphere .",
    "the random interactions are chosen from a gaussian distribution with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to note that in this geometry the size @xmath6 and the `` dimension '' @xmath14 are constrained so it is not possible to do the usual finite size scaling analysis by fixing @xmath14 and let @xmath6 grow to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a real phase transition can only occur in the limit @xmath0 which corresponds to mean field .",
    "nevertheless clear evidences of a phase transition can already be seen at finite size @xmath6 ( or equivalently , finite `` dimension '' @xmath14 ) .",
    "we will see that the present model is very well suited for studying the approach to mean field behaviour and the effects of finite connectivity .",
    "in vector models the usual spin glass order parameter becomes a matrix in the spin components .",
    "it is possible to define the set of overlaps @xmath15 where for the heisenberg case @xmath16 denotes spin components and @xmath17 the sites on the lattice .",
    "as the system presents a global rotational symmetry it is useful to define a rotationally invariant order parameter q whose moments are @xmath18^k\\ ] ] a useful quantity for determining the existence of a phase transition is the so called binder parameter defined , for the heisenberg system @xcite , as @xmath19\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 means a thermal average and the overbar an average over disorder realizations of the bonds . from the scaling properties of this adimensional quantity it turns out that at the critical point the value of _ g _ is independent of the system size and consequently the curves for different sizes must cross each other at @xmath4",
    "this fact permits a rather accurate determination of the critical temperature . considering two replicas of the system @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 it can be defined the spin glass susceptibility as @xmath23 the factor 3 has been introduced in order to have @xmath24 for @xmath25 as in the sk model @xcite . with our definition of the parameter _",
    "q _ the spin glass susceptibility can be expressed @xmath26 the spin glass susceptibility is expected to diverge at and below the spin glass transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "we have done monte carlo simulations of the heisenberg spin glass previously defined and measured the moments @xmath27 and @xmath28 and also the binder parameter and spin glass susceptibility .",
    "the dynamics used has been a standard heat bath algorithm @xcite .",
    "as we are here interested in static properties we have checked that the system was thermalized before measuring physical quantities by looking at the coincidence of the susceptibilities calculated by two different methods , replicas and auto - overlaps as in @xcite .",
    "we have simulated systems of @xmath29 and @xmath30 spins corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "at high thermal noise @xmath25 the spins become independent variables and the limiting values of the moments @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be determined exactly @xcite .",
    "it is found that @xmath34 and @xmath35 figure 1 shows a plot of @xmath36 vs @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the solid lines show the exact predicted behaviour .",
    "the agreement between both results , simulations and analytic , is very impressive given credit to both our data and the analytic result .",
    "as at this temperature the spins are uncorrelated it is not necessary to perform the average over disorder samples . at lower temperatures",
    "we have averaged over 50 to 100 samples .    in figure 2",
    "we can see the spin glass susceptibility rescaled with @xmath3 vs temperature in the range @xmath39 .",
    "the behaviour suggests a finite temperature phase transition in this range of temperatures . from eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) it can be seen that the curves must go to 1 as the temperature increases .",
    "further evidence is obtained from the binder parameter shown in figure 3 .",
    "normally the transition temperature is evidenced by the point where the curves for different sizes intersect .",
    "our results are consistent with a transition at @xmath40 . but the behaviour is quite peculiar ; in the high t regime @xmath41 for the three sizes studied . a possible explanation for this fact may be that the geometry of the lattice is not fixed and also the use of free boundary conditions @xcite . in this lattice all spins",
    "are also in the boundary , so using free boundary conditions make the spins less constrained than , for example , using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we also recall that in this model @xmath6 and @xmath14 grow together , it is not possible to fix @xmath14 and let @xmath6 grow to the thermodynamic limit . in this sense , the three sizes studied correspond also to three different `` dimensions '' of the cell , or coordination values @xmath14 .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath14 is to move the corresponding curve slightly to the right , and this is why we do not see a clear crossing of the succesive @xmath14 curves .",
    "a sensible analysis can be made of the approach to the thermodynamic limit , _",
    "i.e. _ the infinite dimension or completely connected model , where mean field is exact . in the simulations we expect to see corrections to mean field behaviour coming from the finite connectivity @xmath14 .",
    "it is known that the heisenberg spin glass in the mean field limit presents a transition at a critical temperature @xmath42 ( for spins normalized in the unit sphere ) below which there is a continuous breaking of the replica symmetry @xcite .",
    "our results from the binder parameter suggest a slightly lower value that can be explained in part as a finite @xmath14 correction .",
    "in fact , a bethe - peierls approximation for the heisenberg spin glass with coordination @xmath14 predicts a tranisition at a critical temperature given by the equation @xcite : @xmath43 ^ 2 } = 1\\ ] ] in table 1 we show the solutions of this equation for different @xmath14 values .",
    "note that the results will depend strongly on the normalization chosen for the @xmath44 , for example if we had chosen @xmath45 as usual for short range models , the @xmath4 predicted for @xmath46 would be @xmath47 instead of @xmath48 , a considerable difference .",
    "as can be seen the @xmath4 predicted for the range of @xmath14 studied in our simulations are considerably lower than the mean field value 0.333 which shows that the approach to the mean field limit is slow .",
    ".the critical temperatures predicted by the bethe - peierls approximation [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented evidence that isotropic heisenberg spin glasses with finite connectivities present , at low temperatures , a spin glass transition for not too small connectivities .",
    "the overal behaviour of the system is in qualitative agreement with mean field predictions . at high temperatures",
    "finite size effects seem to be very weak and the main corrections come from the finite connectivity @xmath14 .",
    "the critical temperatures for @xmath49 and @xmath2 depart considerably from the mean field ( @xmath50 ) result .",
    "an improved estimation with a bethe - peierls approximation , which takes into account finite connectivity effects , is in very good agreement with the numerical results from extrapolations of the high temperatura data .",
    "we think that the hipercubic cell can be a useful model for studying the robustness of mean field predictions in the more realistic case of short range interactions , while keeping the possibility ( specially from a computational point of view ) of going to considerbly larger values of the connectivity than those which can be attained in ordinary hipercubic lattices . for the heisenberg model",
    "it would be of particular interest the calculation of the distribution of overlaps @xmath51 which gives information of the structure of phase space and whose non trivial character for short range interactions is still in debate .",
