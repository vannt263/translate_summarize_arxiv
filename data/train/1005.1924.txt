    "intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmf ) had not been measured until now , despite their importance for gamma - ray and cosmic - ray astronomy and their likely connection to the primordial fields that could have seeded the stronger magnetic fields observed in galaxies , sun , and earth .",
    "this is because igmf are too small for conventional astronomical probes , such as zeeman splitting or faraday rotation . unlike the fields in galaxies , which are believed to have been amplified by the dynamo action of the large - scale convective motions of gas , the fields in voids remain low , close to their primordial values modified only by the relatively small contribution of the fields leaking out of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the observational and theoretical upper bounds on igmf constrain their magnitudes to be below @xmath2  g @xcite , whereas any value above @xmath310@xmath4  g is sufficient to explain the @xmath5 g galactic magnetic fields generation by the dynamo mechanism @xcite .",
    "one can detect such extremely weak fields using high - energy gamma rays @xcite .",
    "very energetic photons emitted from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or other strong sources produce pairs of electrons and positrons in their interactions with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "these pairs up - scatter the cosmic microwave background photons to high energies , giving rise to an electromagnetic cascade , and the photons from the cascade are detected by gamma - ray telescopes , such as _ fermi_. since the trajectories of electrons and positrons in the cascade are affected by magnetic fields , a gamma - ray image of agn is expected to exhibit a halo of secondary photons around a bright central point - like source @xcite .",
    "the central image is expected to be composed of photons emitted directly from the source with energies below the pair production threshold .",
    "in addition , delays in arrival times of the secondary photons can be used to probe igmf @xcite . finally , at tev energies , the secondary photons produced in interactions of cosmic rays with ebl may have already been observed by the air cherenkov telescopes @xcite .",
    "thus far , in tev range , hegra @xcite and magic @xcite did not detect any halo component of two bright blazars , mrk  501 and mrk  421 , and they set upper limits on the flux .",
    "in particular , the analysis of magic using gamma rays above 300  gev excludes some range of igmf between @xmath6 and @xmath7  g. very recently , igmf above @xmath8  g were proposed as an explanation of non - observation by _ fermi _ of several agn known to be bright tev sources ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we present evidence of extended images and of igmf at @xmath0 level , based on gamma - ray data collected by the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard _ fermi _ , in the energy range between 1  gev and 100  gev . it is consistent with pair - halo scenario with igmf , @xmath9",
    ". the knowledge on igmf will facilitate the future gamma - ray and cosmic ray astronomy , and it will open a new window on the origin of cosmological magnetic fields @xcite , inflation @xcite , and the phase transitions in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the individual photon data as well as the 11-month source catalog @xcite are now publicly available . among @xmath3700 agn in the _ fermi _ agn catalog @xcite",
    ", we select 170 agn that are detected at more than @xmath10 in the highest energy band , 10100 gev , and located at high galactic latitudes , @xmath11 .",
    "these sources are likely to have a hard spectrum , and produce a large number of tev primary photons , which is necessary for the appearance of the secondary halo .",
    "although each individual agn produces too few photon counts , especially in the highest - energy band , one can dramatically improve the statistics by stacking all these 170 agn maps .",
    "we perform the analysis in three separate energy bands : 13 gev , 310 gev , and 10100 gev , which allows us to study the energy dependence of the halos .",
    "to obtain source and model maps , we use official _ science tools _ made publicly available by the _ fermi _ team . the photons that we use in the agn analysis",
    "are collected between 239557417  s and 268416079  s in the mission elapsed time ( met ) , and they are of `` diffuse '' class .",
    "we use locations of agn from the 11-month source catalog , i.e. , those obtained solely by the gamma - ray data .",
    "this does not introduce any significant uncertainty of the stacked images , because the localization accuracy using gamma rays is typically much better than the size of psf especially for hard agn @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : maps ] shows the gamma - ray count maps of stacked 170 agn and the `` best - fit '' point - source model generated with the _ fermi science tools _ as well as point - source catalog , smeared only by point spread function ( psf ) of lat ( we use the latest `` pass6 version 3 '' instrument response function of lat ) .",
    "it is evident that the counts map and the model map are not consistent with each other , especially in the 10100  gev range .",
    "we have performed maximum likelihood analysis assuming that , in addition to the central point sources and diffuse backgrounds @xcite , there is a third component , namely , the halo component , whose spatial extent is given by the gaussian distribution : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the angle from the map center , and @xmath14 is the mean of @xmath15 over this distribution function , @xmath16 .",
    "we fit the histogram of photon counts as a function of @xmath15 read from the maps by minimizing @xmath17 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are treated as free parameters .",
    "the index @xmath21 refers to the @xmath21-th bin , @xmath22 is the total number of events in this bin , @xmath23 is the normalized psf , and @xmath24 is the events due to diffuse backgrounds .",
    "we fix the backgrounds to the values at @xmath252.25 deg@xmath26 and 0.2330.25 deg@xmath26 for 310 gev and 10100 gev , respectively , in the simulated maps , assuming that they are homogeneous .",
    "thus , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the total numbers of photons in the map attributed to the point source and the halo , respectively , and @xmath20 is the apparent angular extent of the halo component .",
    "the inclusion of the halo component improves the fit significantly at high energies .",
    "the minimum @xmath27 over degree of freedom ( @xmath28 ) is @xmath29 and @xmath30 for 310 gev and 10100 gev , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the `` best - fit '' point - source model , where @xmath18 and the background amplitude are treated as free parameters , gives @xmath31 and @xmath32 for 310 gev and 10100 gev , respectively .",
    "this clearly shows that , even though we stack many agn , this simple gaussian halo model gives a very good fit to the data .",
    "the surface brightness profiles @xmath33 of the best - fit halo model are juxtaposed with the data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : bestfit ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour]_a _ , we show the allowed regions of @xmath20 and @xmath34 at 68% and 95% confidence levels . here",
    "@xmath34 is the fraction of the halo photons , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "the best - fit values and @xmath36 statistical errors for these parameters are @xmath37 and @xmath38 for 310 gev , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 for 10100 gev . for the lowest energy band , 13 gev , only an upper limit on @xmath41",
    "is obtained , which is @xmath42 at 95% confidence level .",
    "we discuss the possibility that these halos could be due to some unknown instrumental effect , such as , for example , a possible deviation of lat psf from its value measured in calibration prior to the launch .",
    "to exclude such a possibility , we first consider samples of agn at different redshifts . we divide the 99 agn with known distances ( out of total 170 ) into two groups : a sample of 57 nearby agn with @xmath43 , and a sample of 42 distant agn with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the redshift of the source .",
    "the allowed regions of @xmath20 and @xmath34 for these two samples , both for 310 gev and 10100 gev , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour]_b_. the statistically significant difference between the two populations shown in this figure implies that at least some component of the halos can not be attributed to instrumental effects .",
    "we also note that most agn in the nearby sample at @xmath43 ( 53 among 57 ) are classified as the hardest population of gamma - ray blazars , bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "the distant sample , on the other hand , consists of 33 flat - spectrum radio quasars ( and 9 others ) , which are known to be softer population .",
    "the fact that we measured the brighter and more extended additional components for the nearby / hard sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contour]_b _ ) is consistent with the pair - halo scenario , because the harder agn radiate more tev photons that source secondary halos as well as they are closer .",
    "this can not be easily understood as instrumental systematics , on the other hand , because the true psf size would have to be an increasing function of energy , which is not the case ; see discussions in the next subsection .    as another independent test to rule out instrumental effects , we considered a sample of 43 agn from the same catalog @xcite , which produced no photons above 10  gev but were detected in the 310  gev band at more than @xmath10 .",
    "these sources are likely to have a softer spectrum , with a negligible flux of primary photons above the pair production threshold . in the absence of pair production ,",
    "one expects to see no halos .",
    "as expected , the best fit in the 310  gev band is achieved for @xmath46 , with an upper limit of @xmath47 at 95% confidence level .",
    "the two independent tests described above give one confidence that instrumental effects can not account for all the observed halos .",
    "@xcite repeated our stacking analysis and found the same anomalous excess in the 10100 gev band .",
    "however , they argue , `` most , if not all , of this excess is due to the imperfect knowledge of the psf for the back - converted gamma - rays . ''",
    "this argument is based on the observation that the extent of the crab pulsar is the same as that of agn , and the excess is different between front and back - converted photons . while we agree with @xcite that it is good to perform other independent tests",
    ", we shall show that their arguments fail to exclude the physical halos and overturn the statistical significance of redshift and spectrum tests discussed above . to this end",
    ", we have performed an alternative analysis , using the observed crab profile as a calibrated psf template .",
    "this confirms our initial conclusion and demonstrates that the halos are indeed physical , at @xmath0 level . for the analysis",
    ", we mainly focus on the 310 gev band , because the data have more statistical power than in 10100 gev , as well as the pre - launch psf is better calibrated at lower energies @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : crab ] , we show surface brightness profiles of our nearby and distant samples of agn , where one can see clear difference between the two populations of agn . in the same figure , we also plot the profile of crab,302034833  s. ] which appears to be more consistent with the distant agn than the nearby set .",
    "the backgrounds have been subtracted from the sources ; they were estimated based on the large angular regions , where the contributions from both the point sources and halos are expected to be small .",
    "we note that the excess of agn over crab seen in fig .",
    "4 was not found by @xcite , who analyzed the data in the 10100 gev band , which , as mentioned above , lacks statistical power in comparison with the 310 gev band used here .    to proceed with a quantitative analysis",
    ", we use this crab profile as a psf model in this energy range , and regard crab statistical errors as systematic uncertainties of psf . for example , in angular bin @xmath48@xmath49 deg@xmath26 , _",
    "fermi_-lat received 22 photons from crab , and the background is estimated to be 1.9 .",
    "this is interpreted as 24% systematic uncertainty of psf in this particular bin .",
    "this method is independent of our previous analysis and is free of any uncertainties related to pre - launch psf calibration .",
    "a possible source of additional systematic uncertainties is an energy dependence of psf . in general ,",
    "gamma - ray spectra are different between agn and pulsars , and so are expected psf sizes .",
    "however , the detected spectra of both stacked agn and crab are well approximated by a power law with similar indices ; @xmath50 for nearby agn ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath51 for crab , where @xmath52 is the gamma - ray energy . to probe the spectrum dependence of psf even further ,",
    "we compare the brightness profiles of _ simulated _ maps of nearby / hard and distant / soft agn .",
    "both profiles look very similar , while the profile of hard agn is slightly less extended . in angular bin",
    "@xmath48@xmath49 deg@xmath26 , these agn profiles differ only by 4.4% , which is negligible compared with 24% uncertainty of the crab - based psf due to crab statistics . finally , we note that the width of the psf decreases with energy .",
    "we verified this by comparing crab images in 35 gev and 510 gev bands , and confirming that the former is broader than the latter .",
    "since the spectrum of the nearby agn is harder than that of crab , the instrumental systematics can only make the agn image sharper , not broader , but the opposite is inferred from fig .  [",
    "fig : crab ] .",
    "therefore , it is conservative to ignore the small systematic uncertainties due to spectrum dependence of psf .    adopting the crab profile as a calibrated psf",
    ", we quantitatively investigate the excess of nearby / hard agn profiles identified at @xmath53  deg@xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fig : crab ] . the psf and agn profiles are normalized to each other such that they give the same brightness in the innermost angular bin , @xmath54  deg@xmath26 .",
    "the excess photon counts are @xmath55 . by taking square root of quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic errors as a total error , we find that this excess is of @xmath0 significance . for the distant / soft agn population , on the other hand , the excess is @xmath56 , consistent with null hypothesis . dividing @xmath57 by the total number of psf counts , we obtain the values of @xmath34 for both agn populations : @xmath58 clearly , this conclusion using the crab - calibrated psf agrees with that based on the pre - launch calibration .",
    "one can go even further and design two separate crab - calibrated psfs for two classes of photons , namely those that convert in the front layer and those in the back layer of the detector .",
    "while all of these photons must be used in an analysis , allowing for the differences in psf offers yet another opportunity to find and eliminate some unexpected instrumental effects . to this end",
    ", we introduce another statistical quantity @xmath59 , where all the @xmath60 s with self - explanatory superscripts and subscripts refer to photon counts at @xmath61 deg@xmath26 after the homogeneous backgrounds were subtracted .",
    "this way , we explicitly include any psf differences between front and back - converted photons .",
    "the meaning of @xmath62 is clear : a value consistent with zero corresponds to absence of physical halos .",
    "we obtain @xmath63 , @xmath64 away from the null hypothesis .",
    "we also find that the individual values of @xmath62 for the front and back photons are consistent with each other , within errors .",
    "we have also performed the same analysis for 10100 gev .",
    "here , we renormalized the crab and agn profiles using @xmath65 deg@xmath26 bin , and counted the excess photons over crab - calibrated psf in @xmath660.25 deg@xmath26 .",
    "we obtain @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the excess for nearby / hard agn is found significant at @xmath36 level .",
    "we interpret the size of the halo @xmath20 of a few tenths of degree , in terms of the secondary photon model , especially parameters of igmf .",
    "a simple analytic model gives the following relation between these quantities @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the optical depth for the tev photons that produce halo gamma rays , @xmath71 are the correlation length of igmf , and @xmath72 is the energy - loss length of the electrons and positrons produced by primary tev photons .",
    "because the lower - energy secondary photons originate from the less energetic electrons and positrons that are deflected by larger angles in igmf , one expects a larger halo size @xmath20 at lower energy . as for the dependence on @xmath71 ,",
    "if it is much longer than @xmath72 , then the charged particles can be regarded as propagating in homogeneous magnetic fields ( equivalent to infinite @xmath71 ) , and therefore , the deflection angle is given by the ratio of @xmath72 and the larmor radius .",
    "if @xmath71 is much smaller than @xmath72 , on the other hand , then the electrons and positrons propagate by random walk , with deflections proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "the halo size for the nearby agn sample is @xmath74@xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crab ] ) . assuming @xmath7610 and using an average redshift of the nearby agn sample ,",
    "@xmath77 , the measured extent of the halos is consistent with @xmath78 .",
    "this is the first measurement of the strength of igmf based on a positive detection . with the halo detection also in the 10100 gev band",
    ", we would be able to constrain the correlation length by investigating the energy dependence of @xmath20 .    at the mean redshift of the nearby agn sample ,",
    "the observed halo size of @xmath30.50.8@xmath79 corresponds to 610 mpc .",
    "there are no known astrophysical sources capable of producing images of such a large size .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the halos of the secondary photons provide the only realistic explanation of the data .",
