    "the nature of anomalous velocity discovered during @xmath221  cm surveys of the galaxy has been the subject of much debate in the past three decades .",
    "there appear to be at least four reasonably distinct classes of this gas , namely : ( 1 ) localized outflows and subsequent inflows associated with massive star formation which are commonly referred to as a `` galactic fountain '' ( shapiro & field , 1976 ; bregman , 1980 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the stream of tidal debris from the interaction of the galaxy with the magellanic clouds is another major source of anomalous velocity .",
    "recent imaging ( putman & gibson , 1999 ) has begun to reveal the true extent of this debris system , and allow it to be distinguished from other components .",
    "( 3 ) the extended hvc complexes ( named a , c , h , m ,  ) which span ten s of degrees on the sky and have recently been determined to have both nearby distances of about 10  kpc ( van woerden et al .",
    "1999 ) and rather low ( @xmath30.1 solar ) metal abundance ( wakker et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these diffuse structures appear to be currently merging with the galaxy and each account for some 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 of fresh gas . and finally ( 4 ) the system of compact high velocity clouds ( chvcs ) cataloged by braun & burton ( 1999 ) .",
    "the chvcs form a distinct class of compact , high - contrast emission features at anomalous velocity , which can be readily distinguished from the more diffuse components in the recent high quality surveys ; the leiden / dwingeloo survey in the north ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) and the parkes multibeam survey in the south ( see putman & gibson 1999 ) .",
    "their average angular size is only 1  degree fwhm and the total velocity width 30   fwhm .",
    "the 65 confirmed members of the chvc class share a well - defined kinematic pattern .",
    "a global search for the reference frame that minimizes the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the system , returns the local group standard of rest with high confidence . in this system",
    "the velocity dispersion of the population is only 70  , although it is in - falling toward the local group barycenter at about 100  .",
    "these properties suggest that the objects are : ( 1 ) associated with the local group rather than the galaxy as such , ( 2 ) that they are likely to reside at quite substantial distances and ( 3 ) have as yet had little tidal interaction with the more massive local group members .",
    "a program of high resolution imaging of the chvcs has begun to provide further insights into the nature of these sources .",
    "an initial sub - sample of six chvcs was imaged with the upgraded westerbork array ( wsrt ) in december 1998 .",
    "a complete description of those results can be found in braun & burton ( 2000 ) .",
    "the sub - sample was chosen to span a wide range of positions on the sky and in line - of - sight velocity , as well as gas content and linewidth .",
    "an additional eight sources have been imaged with the wsrt during the summer of 1999 , specifically targeting objects suspected of having very bright and narrow emission features .",
    "a sample of ten chvcs have also been imaged with the upgraded arecibo telescope in november of 1999 .",
    "in addition to fully - sampled images of the central square degree , a very deep cross - cut of two degree length was obtained for each source reaching an rms sensitivity of about @xmath6  =  10@xmath7  @xmath8 at 10   resolution .",
    "full accounts of these recent results will be given elsewhere .",
    "all of the imaged sources share a number of common properties .",
    "each source contains between one and ten compact cores ( of 1 to 10 arcmin extent ) embedded in a diffuse halo of about 1  degree diameter .",
    "an average of 40% of the line flux arises in the compact cores ( although the range varies between 1 and 60% ) .",
    "the peak column density in these cores varies between 10@xmath9 and 10@xmath10  @xmath8 .",
    "the fractional surface area of each source which exceeds a column density of 5@xmath11 is only 15% on average , although this also varies greatly from source to source .",
    "the remainder of the emission arises in a diffuse halo which reaches peak column densities of @xmath12@xmath13  @xmath8 but declines smoothly with an exponential profile to values of @xmath14  @xmath8 or less ( as illustrated in fig.2 ) .",
    "the resolved linewidths toward the core components ( with 1  arcmin resolution ) are typically only 5   fwhm ( but range from as little as 2 to as much as 15  ) .",
    "all of the core linewidths are sufficiently narrow that it is possible to unambiguously identify these with the cool neutral medium phase of , with typical kinetic temperature of 100  k. the diffuse halos , on the other hand , all have resolved linewidths ( with 3  arcmin resolution ) of 2125   fwhm , as seen in fig.2d .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence of halo emission with linewidths equal to or exceeding the thermal linewidth of 8000  k gas ( 21   fwhm ) provides an unambiguous identification of these halos with the warm neutral medium phase of .",
    "a shielding column of wnm is one prerequisite for the condensation of cnm cores in calculations of thermodynamics ( eg .",
    "wolfire et al .",
    "the second prerequisite for cnm condensation is a sufficiently high thermal pressure , in excess of about p / k  =  100  @xmath15k .",
    "both of these aspects are illustrated in the phase diagram shown in fig.1d .",
    "an adequate shielding column of wnm is clearly detected in the chvcs , as just discussed above .",
    "we will return to the question of an adequate thermal pressure below .",
    "another general result is that the cnm core components are dynamically decoupled from their wnm halos .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.2 , where a substantial velocity gradient of some 30   is seen within the major core component of chvc158@xmath1639@xmath16285 .",
    "such large gradients are not observed in the halo gas , which instead is always centered near the systemic velocity of the system .",
    "this dichotomy suggests that while the cores may represent flattened rotating disks , the halos are more nearly spherical distributions .",
    "one of the objects imaged with the wsrt , chvc125 + 41@xmath16207 , has proven particularly interesting for several reasons .",
    "this object has a number of opaque core components of only @xmath17  =  90angular size , a brightness temperature in emission of 75  k , and linewidths so narrow ( less than 2   fwhm ) that the kinetic temperature ( t@xmath18  =  85  k ) , opacity ( @xmath19  =  2 ) and column density (  =  10@xmath10@xmath8 ) , can be accurately derived .",
    "a good estimate of the volume density ( n@xmath20  =  2@xmath11  @xmath15 ) for this object has been made by modeling the thermodynamics ( wolfire et al .",
    "comm . ) . with these quantities in hand and only the assumption of crude spherical symmetry for the cores ,",
    "it is possible to estimate the source distance from d  =  /(n@xmath20@xmath17 )  =  600@xmath1300  kpc .",
    "the same object has also allowed the first measurement of chvc metallicity , since the bright uv source mrk  205 is located behind its diffuse halo .",
    "bowen , blades and pettini ( 1995 ) detect unsaturated mgii absorption , with 0.15   ew at the chvc velocity , while we detect a neutral column  =  5@xmath2110@xmath22 @xmath8 at the same position .",
    "the implied metal abundance is about 0.05 solar .",
    "although many of the chvcs have only one or two core components , a handful of these objects might best be called chvc clusters .",
    "as many as ten cores are seen in close proximity ( within 3050  arcmin ) , each with its own systemic velocity and internal kinematics ( which we address below ) but sharing the same diffuse halo of shielding gas .",
    "the most extreme case is that of chvc115 + 13@xmath16275 , where the cores have relative velocities as high as 70   and angular separations as large as 30  arcmin . if these are gravitationally bound systems ( and their cool gas content and isolation on the sky make this seem plausible ) then they have a dynamical mass , @xmath23 , and gas mass @xmath24 . if for example the distance were 0.7  mpc , then @xmath25 m@xmath26 and @xmath27 m@xmath26",
    ". the dark  to  gas mass ratio in this case has the rather substantial value of @xmath28  =  51 , which scales with @xmath29 for other distance estimates .",
    "as already noted above , many of the chvc cores give an indication for organized internal kinematics .",
    "many of the cores have a systematic velocity gradient along the long axis of their elliptical distribution which is very suggestive of rotation in a flattened disk system .",
    "several examples are shown in figs.1 and 2 .",
    "the best - resolved examples of this pattern have been subjected to the standard tilted ring fitting algorithms used in deriving galactic rotation curves .",
    "good solutions for rotation are found ( fig.1c ) which slowly rise over some 6  arcmin to constant values of 15 to 20  .",
    "the shapes of these rotation curves are in very good agreement with those predicted by navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) for a cdm halo at 0.7  mpc distance ( as shown in fig.1c ) .",
    "the dark  to  visible mass ratios in these two cases are @xmath28  =  36 and 29 .",
    "the presence of a significant dark matter component is important not only for understanding the kinematics of the individual cores and the chvc clusters , but also for understanding the thermodynamics . as noted earlier , a significant thermal pressure in excess of about p / k  =  100  @xmath15k is required to allow condensation of the cool cores observed in the chvcs ( see fig.1d , upper ) .",
    "the mass density provided within the central few kpc of an nfw halo in this mass range ( fig.1d , lower ) is sufficient to provide the required hydrostatic pressure in combination with the observed warm halo column densities of about 10@xmath9@xmath8 ( see also braun & burton 2000 ) .",
