    "our aim is to derive a simple but accurate empirical photometric redshift estimator which is model - independent .",
    "we do not use spectral templates ; we only use a training set of galaxies with multiband photometry and measured redshifts .",
    "we have applied our method to the hubble deep field ( hdf ) ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) and derived a catalog of estimated redshifts for 848 hdf galaxies with @xmath5 and with measured fluxes in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( wang , bahcall , & turner 1998 ) .    to derive formulae for the estimated redshifts , we first divide the galaxy redshift sample ( the training set ) into regions of high and low redshifts ( @xmath3 and @xmath1 ) based on empirical color cuts .",
    "we then divide both regions into color ranges to minimize dispersion .",
    "the physical motivation for this latter step is to reflect color shifts with @xmath10 for different type galaxies .",
    "we then find the best linear fit between redshift and colors for each color range , z_a = c_1+c_2(u - b)+c_3(b - v)+c_4(v - i ) , where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are constants . here",
    "we have assumed that photometry has been done in four bands , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the dispersion ( @xmath13 ) between our estimated redshift , @xmath14 , and the measured spectroscopic redshift , @xmath10 , is calculated using the jack knife method . for a sample with @xmath15 data points , we make @xmath15 subsamples ,",
    "each omitting one data point .",
    "we then carry out linear fits @xmath15 times on the @xmath16 data point subsamples .",
    "we use each fit to make a prediction for the omitted data point ; the rms of the true values of the omitted points about the fit predictions , scaled by @xmath17^{1/2}$ ] , is the rms dispersion of our fit .",
    "the estimated dispersions of our formulae are therefore quite robust .",
    "the error in @xmath14 due to photometric errors is z_a=^1/2 .",
    "we used 82 galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts @xmath18 in the hdf as our training set ( cohen et al .",
    "1996 ; hogg et al . 1998 ; lowenthal et al . 1997 ; phillips et al 1997 ; steidel et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we did not use all 90 ( excluding three @xmath19 galaxies with erroneous / uncertain @xmath10 s ) hdf galaxies with measured @xmath10 s .",
    "the eight outlying galaxies have @xmath20 , mostly near the boundaries of the color ranges ; these galaxies were not used in deriving our redshift estimator .",
    "we found that for @xmath3 , the galaxies satisfy at least one of the following three color selection criteria : u25.66 , u - b0.91 , b - v1.37 , v - i0.5 ; i>23.5 , u - b>2.2 ; i>23.5 , b - v>2.2 , u - b>-0.5 .",
    "the galaxies with @xmath21 in the training set do not satisfy any of the above relations , suggesting that @xmath21 galaxies generally fall outside these color - magnitude regions .",
    "we divide @xmath21 galaxies into three color ranges ( cr ) , and determine the best - fit redshift estimate formula and dispersion for each color range :    \\1 .",
    "cr=1 : @xmath22 ( 28 galaxies ) [ eq : lz3,1 ] z_a=0.4111 - 0.1852(u - b)-0.3062(b - v)+0.7301(v - i ) , 0.7 cm _ z=0.034 ; 2 .",
    "cr=2 : @xmath23 ( 21 galaxies ) [ eq : lz3,2 ] z_a=0.163 - 0.171(u - b)+0.340(b - v)+0.194(v - i ) , _ z=0.095 ; 3 .",

    "our empirical photometric redshift estimator is consistent with template - based photometric redshift estimators where calibrating redshift samples are available .",
    "fig.2(a ) compares our empirically estimated redshift @xmath14 ( given by eqs.([eq : lz3,1])-([eq : hz2,2 ] ) ) with the template - fitting photometric redshift @xmath30 of sawicki et .",

    "the symbols are the same as in fig.1 .",
    "the solid diagonal line indicates @xmath32 ; the dotted lines mark the region @xmath33 .",
    "about 90% of the galaxies fall within the dotted lines .",
    "there are 32 new spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath34 hdf galaxies ( dickinson 1998 , phillips et al .",
    "1998 , steidel et al . 1999 ) listed in the recent paper by fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which were not available to us when we derived our photometric estimator ( wang et al .",
    "fig.3(a ) shows the difference between our estimated redshift @xmath14 and the spectroscopic redshift @xmath10 , scaled by @xmath35 , as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "as can be seen , our empirical redshift estimator yields excellent predictions for @xmath21 , with @xmath36 for all 18 @xmath21 galaxies , and with @xmath37 if we omit the most discrepant object . for @xmath19 galaxies ,",
    "we find @xmath38 for all 14 galaxies , and @xmath39 if we omit the galaxy with @xmath40 .",
    "the larger dispersion between @xmath14 and @xmath10 for @xmath19 is largely due to the small number of spectroscopic redshifts which were used in deriving the redshift estimator .",
    "galaxies in the redshift range @xmath4 have flat spectra , which makes the measurement of their spectroscopic redshifts difficult .",
    "the absence of calibrators in the range @xmath41 ( see fig.1 ) leads to an artificial gap in fig.2(a ) for @xmath42 in our estimated redshift @xmath14 .    to illustrate how the gap in fig.2(a )",
    "can be filled , we select galaxies which satisfy [ eq : gap ] & & 23.4 i<26.84 , u26 , + & & |v - i|0.6 , |b - v|0.8 , 0.6 u - b 2 .",
    "we assume that these galaxies satisfy the same color redshift relation as the color range cr@xmath43 galaxies ( which are closest to the intermediate redshift galaxies in color and redshift ) , but with a different constant offset ( see eq.([eq : lz3,3 ] ) ) , i.e. , [ eq : zgap ] z_a=1.5 + 0.480(u - b)-0.513(b - v)-0.250(v - i ) .",
    "the constant offset value has been obtained by calibrating with a galaxy which satisfies eq.([eq : gap ] ) and has spectroscopic redshift @xmath40 .",
    "fig.2(b ) presents our estimated redshift @xmath14 versus the sawicki et al .",
    "template based photometric redshift @xmath30 ; it is the same as fig.2(a ) , but with the addition of eq.([eq : gap ] ) to select flat spectrum galaxies ( represented by star symbols ) with estimated redshifts given by eq.([eq : zgap ] ) .",
    "this addition improves on the previous comparison by moving a number of galaxies with @xmath44 and @xmath45 or @xmath46 in fig.2(a ) into the redshift gap of fig.2(b ) .",
    "we can modify our empirical photometric redshift estimator by adding eq.([eq : gap ] ) to select flat spectrum galaxies with estimated redshifts given by eq.([eq : zgap ] ) , before applying eqs.([eq : lz3,1])-([eq : hz2,2 ] ) ) .",
    "fig.3(b ) shows the difference between our modified estimated redshift @xmath14 and the spectroscopic redshift @xmath10 , scaled by @xmath35 , as a function of @xmath10 , for 32 newly measured galaxy redshifts .",
    "the modified redshift estimator makes the estimated redshifts for @xmath19 galaxies less biased , with @xmath47 for 13 @xmath19 galaxies ( excluding the calibrator galaxy with @xmath40 ) .",
    "the advantage of our method is that it is model - independent and simple .",
    "the disadvantage of the method is that it requires a galaxy redshift sample for training ; this is clearly seen in fig.2(a ) , where an artificial gap for @xmath42 exists as a result of the absence of calibrators with measured redshifts in the range @xmath41 ( see fig.1 ) . in this paper , we have illustrated how this gap in estimated redshifts can be filled by modifying the empirical photometric redshift estimator to include flat spectrum galaxies ( see  3 ) .",
    "it is important to fill the gap in measured spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath48 , as it would enable better calibration of photometric redshift estimators , and better understanding of the nature of intermediate redshift galaxies .",
    "since our method is purely empirical , it is sensitive to the data properties of the training set . in order to find and remove possible systematic effects in the photometric redshift estimator due to selection effects in the redshift measurements , it is important to have spectroscopic redshift surveys which are complete to a given magnitude limit .",
