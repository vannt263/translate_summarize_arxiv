    "_ chandra _ x - ray observatory has found strong x - ray emission from large scale jets of many radio loud quasars . some of them ,",
    "most notorious , pks 0637 - 752 @xcite and 3c 273 @xcite , are hard to explain by synchrotron radiation from a high energy extension of radio - optical emitting electrons , since the observed x - ray flux is far above the extension from radio - optical spectra and since the x - ray spectrum is harder than the optical one .",
    "the most conventional synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model requires a very small magnetic field strength , which means a large departure from equi - partition between magnetic field and relativistic electrons with an enormous jet power .",
    "the latter has been regarded unlikely .",
    "it is then considered that inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons may explain the x - ray emission provided that the jet is relativistic and makes a small angle with the line of sight @xcite .",
    "both ssc and ic / cmb models predict that high energy extension of the x - ray spectrum reaches gev energy range which can be detected with _",
    "lat @xcite .",
    "recently , _ fermi _ lat observations have been reported to put upper limits of the @xmath1-ray flux for the jets of 3c 273 @xcite and pks",
    "0637 - 752 @xcite .",
    "they are an order of magnitude lower than the ssc and ic / cmb predictions so that these models are incompatible with observations .",
    "in this situation , several alternative models should be considered . within the leptonic scenario , a separate population of electrons from those emitting radio - optical photons , extending up to around 100 tev",
    "is considered .",
    "those electrons emit x - ray photons by synchrotron radiation .",
    "the existence of such an electron population is rather ad - hoc although not impossible .",
    "its origin is usually considered a separate particle acceleration process from that for the radio - optical emitting population .",
    "however , it is hard to imagine such an efficient acceleration mechanism , since the high energy end of radio - optical emitting electrons is determined by the balance of acceleration and radiative cooling .",
    "actually , for pks 0637 - 752 , radio , optical , and x - ray emissions are spatially coincident and concentrated in a few bright knots , the size of which is an order of kpc , and the broadband spectra imply a break around @xmath3-@xmath4 hz which is naturally due to radiative cooling across the source .    alternatively , relativistic hadrons may be responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite and earlier @xcite considered proton synchrotron emission assuming magnetic field stronger than 10 mg and a large energy density of accelerated protons up to more than 10 pev .",
    "although they argued that the proton and poynting powers are modest , it is due to their adopted time scale .",
    "they assumed that the confinement time is as long as @xmath5-@xmath6 years , which is a few orders of magnitude longer than the light crossing time of @xmath7-@xmath8 years .",
    "since the jet does not involve a large inertia nor a large confining pressure , we regard that the relevant time scale should be similar to the latter .",
    "then , the required proton and poynting powers become an order of @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 and @xmath11 erg s@xmath10 , respectively . at the same time",
    ", the energy density of relativistic electrons becomes about six orders of magnitude smaller than that of the poynting power .",
    "relativistic protons also contribute to x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission through the production of high energy electrons and positrons by bethe - heitler and photo - pion processes .",
    "the latter processes were considered before the _ chandra _ era by @xcite for a possible mechanism of the x - ray emission from hot spots of radio galaxies .",
    "@xcite also examined these processes for the knot a1 of 3c 273 and concluded that they are too inefficient .",
    "but , the efficiency of these processes depends on the size of the knot as well as the infrared photon spectrum .",
    "the proton models have been discussed for more compact emission regions of blazars and bethe - heitler process can contribute to the same order , depending on the soft photon spectral shape @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper , we consider both bethe - heitler and photo - pion processes and examine if these processes can explain the x - ray emission from pks 0762 - 752 .    in section [ sec :",
    "estimate ] we make a rough estimate of physical quantities of the x - ray emitting large scale jet of pks 0637 - 752 , whose redshift is 0.651 . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we formulate the problem , and in section [ sec : results ] numerical results are presented . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we draw conclusions .",
    "we first make a rough estimate of the physical quantities in order to capture the essence of the problem . for simplicity , we assume a single uniform sphere of radius @xmath12 kpc for the emission region and ignore effects of relativistic beaming and redshift for the time being .",
    "although the emission region is divided into a few knots in reality , we here treat a combined emission region .    observed spectra at radio through optical frequencies suggest that the synchrotron emission from primary electrons has a peak at infrared band around @xmath3 hz with a luminosity @xmath13 about @xmath14 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "thus , energy density of synchrotron photons @xmath15 is about @xmath16 the number density of photons at radio frequencies may be approximated by @xmath17 and that at optical frequencies @xmath18 for the magnetic field strength of @xmath19 mg , the energy density of magnetic field is @xmath20 and the poynting power is estimated as @xmath21    the lorentz factor of electrons ranges from to @xmath22 with a broken power law spectrum . the power law index of electrons is tentatively taken as 2.5 at low energies and 3.5 at high energies in accordance with the above photon spectra . and estimated as @xmath23 it may seem that luminosity can be large , if the magnetic field strength is smaller than 0.1 mg for a typical source size of 1 kpc . however , in this case , most of the inverse compton emission is produced in the mev - gev range . to reproduce the observed x - ray flux",
    ", magnetic field needs to be as small as 0.01 mg . in this case",
    ", the kinetic power of electrons given by @xmath24 would become very large , here , we take the escape time of electrons as @xmath25 .",
    "historically , for this reason , the beamed ic / cmb model was proposed , but as noted in section [ sec : intro ] , this model is now regarded unlikely . the minimum power for explaining the radio - optical flux",
    "is realized at @xmath26 for @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the break energy of the electron energy distribution , is determined by the balance between synchrotron cooling and escape ; if we equate the cooling time with escape time , we obtain @xmath29 if the break corresponds to the break of radio - optical spectrum at @xmath3 hz , we obtain the field strength of around 0.2 mg for @xmath30 .",
    "these considerations lead to @xmath31 as an appropriate choice",
    ".    the maximum possible lorentz factor of electrons is estimated by equating the cooling time with the gyrotime and given by @xmath32 thus , in principle it is possible to obtain @xmath33 as large as @xmath6 with which electrons emit synchrotron x - rays . however , since the observed x - ray spectrum is much flatter than the optical spectrum , such a high energy population should be separate from radio - optical emitting one and the acceleration mechanism should be very efficient and distinct . alternatively , such electrons may be supplied from photo - hadronic processes .",
    "it should be noted that agn jets are composed of protons and electrons / positrons and the inertia is likely to be dominated by protons , while the existence of electron - positron pairs is also suggested by various analysis of observations .",
    "proton acceleration also naturally place and in principle the maximum energy of protons can be as large as @xmath34 ev for 1 mg field and 1 kpc size .",
    "two photo - hadronic processes can provide secondary high energy electrons / positrons , i.e. , photo - pion production process and bethe - heitler process .",
    "the former is through strong interaction with the cross section of about @xmath35 and the threshold energy of @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the energy of a target photon .",
    "thus , for @xmath38 , the energy of target photons should be larger than @xmath39 hz with the number density about @xmath40 for @xmath27 .",
    "thus , a proton interaction probability is around 0.1 for rectilinear propagation .",
    "charged pions decay to produce electrons and positrons , while neutral pions decay into two @xmath1-rays , which interact with soft photons to produce electron - positron pairs .",
    "we estimate 0.5 % of the proton power can be used to produce electrons and positrons with the lorentz factor of around @xmath41 , which subsequently radiate synchrotron radiation below the tev energy region for @xmath42 .",
    "while photons with energy higher than tev is optically thick to photon - photon pair production , most synchrotron photons are emitted below tev and pair cascade process does not much develop . since these electrons / positrons rapidly cool to make the energy distribution of a power law with an index of @xmath43 , the resultant photon energy spectrum is a power law with an index of @xmath44 and the x - ray luminosity is four orders of magnitudes smaller than the tev luminosity .",
    "thus , if we would explain the x - ray observations with this mechanism , the predicted gev luminosity becomes around @xmath45 , which exceeds the _ fermi _ lat upper limit . required proton power is uncomfortably large amounting to @xmath46 .",
    "higher energy protons exacerbate the problem and lower energy protons have a negligibly small interaction probability .",
    "bethe - heitler process has a larger cross section of @xmath47 and the lower threshold energy of @xmath48 but with a lower efficiency of energy transfer to electrons and positrons . for @xmath49 , target photon",
    "energy is larger than @xmath50 hz with the number density @xmath51 for @xmath27 , and on average a proton produces 5 electron - positron pairs before it escapes from the region . taking the efficiency of 0.001",
    ", 0.5% of the proton power can be used to pair production , roughly the same order as the photo - pion production . in this case",
    ", however , the injection lorentz factor of electrons and positrons is around and the synchrotron frequency is peaked at 100mev for @xmath52 mg .",
    "since the resultant synchrotron spectrum becomes a power law with an index of @xmath44 , the x - ray luminosity is about two orders of magnitudes lower than the 100 mev luminosity .",
    "the required proton power is around @xmath53 , which is very large but not inconceivable considering the poynting power is an order of @xmath54 .",
    "when the magnetic field strength is 0.1 mg , the required proton power is @xmath55 , the power of primary electrons becomes @xmath56 while the poynting power is @xmath57 .",
    "thus we regard about @xmath58 is a best guess .",
    "somewhat lower energy protons also contribute to bethe - heitler process ; although the interaction probability becomes lower , the injection lorentz factor also becomes smaller , which makes the synchrotron peak lower .",
    "for example , for @xmath59 , the target photon energy is above @xmath60 hz with the number density of @xmath40 , and the interaction probability of a proton becomes 1 .",
    "thus 0.1% of the proton power is available .",
    "the injection lorentz factor of electrons / positrons is also @xmath61 , which emit synchrotron radiation at 1 mev for @xmath62 or 0.1 mev for @xmath63 .",
    "so the proton power of @xmath64 gives rise to the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "it is to be noted that for a larger @xmath65 the interaction probability of protons becomes small and required proton power accordingly increases ; a larger @xmath65 is unfavorable for the photo - hadronic model . for these parameters ,",
    "proton synchrotron luminosity is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the synchrotron luminosity of secondary pairs .",
    "its peak is at @xmath0 hz for @xmath66 .",
    "since the resultant emission spectra depend on details of the secondary electron / positron spectra and resultant radiative cooling , we numerically investigate such details in the next section .",
    "based on the present investigation , in this paper , we concentrate on bethe - heitler process .",
    "we adopt a single zone model in which the size of the emission region of @xmath67 around 1 kpc , magnetic field of @xmath68 around 0.1 mg , and the proton spectrum is @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "canonically we take @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "since photo - hadronic processes work only for large values of @xmath74 , the value of @xmath75 does not affect the resultant spectrum but only affects the energy density of protons .",
    "if proton energy distribution is concentrated in the range near @xmath76 , the power requirement below will be relieved by an order of magnitude .",
    "note that the estimates of the proton power and proton energy density given in the previous section are those for such a high energy population and an order of magnitude lower than those for @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast @xmath76 critically affects the results .",
    "the energy density of protons is @xmath77 the proton power is @xmath78 where we take the escape time of @xmath25 .",
    "the target photon spectra of photo - pion and bethe - heitler processes are based on the observed radio to optical photons , taking into account of the cosmological redshift of 0.651 .",
    "primary electrons responsible for the radio - optical emission are determined so as to reproduce the radio - optical spectra .",
    "we also calculate the inverse compton scattering of primary electrons off radio - optical photons , whose flux is generally orders of magnitude short of x - ray observations . in numerical calculations",
    "we solve the kinetic equation of primary electrons with the injection spectrum given by @xmath79 , where @xmath33 is the lorentz factor of electrons and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are parameters to fit the observed radio - optical spectrum .",
    "since we consider only mildly relativistic beaming if any , we ignore ic / cmb .",
    "although the number density of cmb photons is larger than that of radio - optical synchrotron photons when @xmath65 is larger than 10 , the efficiency of those processes becomes small for large @xmath67 , so that our treatment is justified .",
    "the emission by high energy leptons produced by the hadronic processes is calculated for the lepton spectrum obtained by solving the kinetic equation given by @xmath83 ,    \\label{eq : e - kinetic - hadronic}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the lepton density per unit interval of @xmath33 .",
    "the lepton injection rate is denoted by @xmath85 for bethe - heitler process , which is calculated according to the formulation given by @xcite , lepton production via photo - pion processes is denoted by @xmath86 .",
    "however , we do not include this term in numerical calculations because the leptons produced by photo - pion processes do not contribute much to the x - ray emission .",
    "here @xmath87 denotes radiative cooling through synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering .",
    "we also set the lepton escape time to be @xmath88 . using the steady solution of equation ( [ eq",

    "[ sec : estimate ] , the production spectrum by bethe - heitler process has a rather broad number spectrum centered on @xmath94 , while those through photo - pion production have a at @xmath95-@xmath3 .",
    "the energy injection rate for both processes concentrates on the high energy ends , with the bethe - heitler process being an order of magnitude larger than that for the photo - pion production .",

    "the proton power amounts to @xmath99 .",
    "although this seems to be too large , it can be reduced by an order of magnitude if @xmath75 is large enough or if the spectral index of protons is less than 2 , i.e. , when the energy of relativistic protons is concentrated in the high energy end .",
    "we tabulate in table [ table : prod - rate-2 - 18 ] the pair production rates for @xmath100 and 1.8 .",
    "the resultant photon spectra are shown in figure [ fig:1kpc - no - beaming - exp ] . as is seen ,",
    "while an overall spectral shape is well reproduced , optical flux at @xmath101 hz tends to be overproduced . at this frequency",
    "primary electrons and secondary pairs equally contribute and the resultant combined flux is a factor of two higher than the observed one .",
    "this is due to radiative cooling of secondary pairs and rather a general feature . for a range of the magnetic field strength this feature persists in the present model",
