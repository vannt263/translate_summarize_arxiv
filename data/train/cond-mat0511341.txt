    "the electromagnetic force felt by a neutral atom near the surface of a substrate has been object of an intense investigation since the pioneering works by casimir and polder @xcite and lifshitz , dzyaloshinskii and pitaevskii @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fundamental character of the force , these studies @xcite are presently motivated by the possibility of technological applications @xcite , by searching stronger constrains on hypothetical non newtonian forces @xcite as well as its role in biological systems @xcite .",
    "new perspectives to study such a force are opened by the recent development in storing and manipulating ultra - cold atoms .",
    "indeed experimental and theoretical research has been recently focused on the forces acting on ultra - cold atomic gases due to the presence of a nearby surface .",
    "they include atomic beams @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite and degenerate fermi gases @xcite .",
    "the surface - atom force at thermal equilibrium @xmath0 can be in general separated in two parts @xmath1 the first one , @xmath2 , is related to zero - point fluctuations ( @xmath3 ) of the electromagnetic field . at short distances @xmath4 this force behaves like @xmath5 and is the analog of the van der waals - london inter - atomic force . at larger distances the inclusion of relativistic retardation effects gives rise to the casimir - polder asymptotic behaviour @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the static polarizability of the atom and the static dielectric function of the substrate respectively . the function @xmath9 is defined , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the second contribution to the force , @xmath10 , is due to the thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this contribution was first considered by lifshitz @xcite who applied the theory of electromagnetic fluctuations developed by rytov @xcite . at large distances",
    "the thermal contribution approaches the so - called lifshitz law @xmath11 such asymptotic behaviour is reached at distances larger than the thermal wavelength @xmath12 , corresponding to @xmath13 at room temperature .",
    "thus it is the leading contribution to the total force .",
    "the lifshitz force was originally evaluated at thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "a non - trivial issue is the study of such a force out of thermal equilibrium , characterizing configurations where the temperature of the substrate @xmath14 and environment @xmath15 , do not coincide .",
    "for instance in typical experiments with ultra - cold atomic gases the environment temperature is determined by the chamber containing the substrate and the trapped atoms .    in this paper",
    "we describe the surface - atom force out of thermal equilibrium and how to recover its asymptotic behaviour at large distances .",
    "we assume that the radiation surrounding the atom is not able to populate its internal excited states which are assumed to be at energies @xmath16 much higher than the thermal energy : @xmath17 this condition is very well satisfied at ordinary temperatures ( for example the first optical resonance of rb atoms corresponds to @xmath18k ) .",
    "in the last part of the paper we analyze the effects of such a force on cold atoms , and in particular on the center - of - mass motion of a trapped bose - einstein condensate and on the bloch oscillations of ultra - cold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "in the calculation of the surface - atom force the main ingredient is clearly the electromagnetic field and its sources .",
    "the latter , in our approach , are treated as point - like oscillating dipoles .",
    "furthermore it is useful to write the fields using the green s function formalism , the green s function being the solution of the wave equation for a point - like source .",
    "once this solution is known , the solution due to a general source can be obtained by the principle of linear superposition .",

    "a first important investigation of the surface - atom force out of thermal equilibrium was carried out by henkel _",
    "@xcite who calculated the force generated by a dielectric substrate at finite temperature by assuming that the environment temperature is zero .",
    "the principal motivation of that paper was the study of the force at short distances .",
    "in this section we analyze the general case of an atom placed in vacuum at a distance @xmath4 from the flat surface of a substrate that we assume to be locally at thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath14 which can be equal or different from the environment temperature @xmath15 , the global system being in or out of thermal equilibrium respectively , but in a stationary regime @xcite . in this configuration",
    "it is relatively easy to describe the radiation produced by the flat substrate , while it is less trivial to describe the radiation coming from the environment .",
    "to face this problem we use the lifshitz trick @xcite for which the vacuum half space is assumed to be a dielectric locally at thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath15 , by introducing an infinitesimal imaginary part of its dielectric function . using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and after integrating over an infinite volume the vacuum half space produces a radiation corresponding to the one that in a real systems is generated by the environment walls at @xmath15 .",

    "the figure clearly shows that the thermal effects out of equilibrium are sizable ( solid lines ) , thereby providing promising perspectives for future measurements of the surface - atom force at large distances . to increase the attractive nature of the force it is much more convenient to heat the substrate by keeping the environment at room temperature ( lower solid line ) rather than heating the whole system ( dashed line ) .",
    "when @xmath83 ( upper solid line ) the force exhibits a characteristic change of sign reflecting a repulsive nature at large distances ( see also discussion below ) . at short distances the thermal correction to the force becomes smaller and smaller and is determined by the temperature of the substrate .",

    "the new dependence of @xmath112 on temperature and distance can be physically understood by noticing that the main contribution to the @xmath4 dependent part of the electric energy @xmath113 arises from @xmath102 .",
    "such values of @xmath93 correspond to the component of the black - body radiation impinging on the surface from the dielectric side in a small interval of angles , of order of @xmath114 , near the angle of total reflection . this radiation creates slowly damping evanescent waves in vacuum . as",
    "a result @xmath112 turns out to be , in accordance with eq.([levlimit ] ) , of order of @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the energy density of the black - body radiation .",
    "equation ( [ levlimit ] ) holds for a dielectric substrate where @xmath8 is finite . if we want to find the large distance limit for a metal we should use equation ( [ ld ] ) . in the limit of small values of @xmath117 we can use the drude model .",
    "as only frequencies @xmath118 contribute , one can substitute in eq.([f ] ) @xmath119 , the real part @xmath120 remaining finite as @xmath121 .",
    "than one finds @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the electric conductivity , so that for a drude metal eq.([levlimit ] ) is replaced by @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the riemann function .",
    "it is easy to show that eq.([levlimmetal ] ) is valid at the condition @xmath126",
    "ultra - cold gases can provide a useful probe of the surface - atom force .",
    "tool sensitive to the gradient of the surface - atom force is in fact the frequency shift of the center - of - mass oscillation of a trapped bose - einstein condensate @xcite . on the other hand , experiments based on bloch oscillations are _ interferometric _ tools sensitive to the force itself @xcite .",
    "finally one could also think to interference experiments involving the macroscopic phase of bose - einstein condensates in a double well potential @xcite .",
    "the position of the corresponding interference fringes are sensitive to the surface - atom potential . in the last part of this paper",
    "we discuss the first two above mentioned experiments .",
    "bose - einstein condensed gases @xcite are very dilute , ultra - cold samples characterized by unique properties of coherence and superfluidity .",
