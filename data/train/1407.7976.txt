    "more than a quarter century has passed since the discovery of infrared excess emission from the nearby white dwarf g29 - 38 @xcite .",
    "photometric observations conducted at the nasa infrared telescope facility atop mauna kea in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 bands revealed flux in excess of that expected for the relatively cool white dwarf . while a warm dust disk was considered a possibility , the infrared excess was initially attributed to a spatially unresolved brown dwarf . in particular ,",
    "1000k circumstellar dust was considered unlikely due to rapid dissipation from radiation drag .",
    "prophetically , @xcite noted that if material were orbiting sufficiently close to achieve such a high temperature , then spectral signatures of accretion should be seen .    within a few years , and thanks to intense observational and theoretical interest from a diverse set of researchers , evidence began to disfavor a substellar companion as the origin of the infrared emission .",
    "first , some of the earliest infrared imaging arrays revealed g29 - 38 to be a point source in all available bandpasses .",
    "second , near - infrared spectroscopy measured a thermal continuum @xcite , whereas a very cool atmosphere was expected to exhibit absorption features .",
    "third , the detection of optical stellar pulsations echoed in the near - infrared were difficult to reconcile with a brown dwarf secondary @xcite .",
    "fourth and finally , significant 10@xmath8 m emission was detected at g29 - 38 , at a level a few times greater than expected for an object with a jupiter - sized radius , essentially ruling out the brown dwarf companion hypothesis @xcite .    a decade after the discovery of its infrared excess , the optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic detection of multiple metal species in the atmosphere of g29 - 38 @xcite made it clear that the star was accreting from its immediate environs .",
    "although white dwarfs with metal absorption features have been known for nearly a century ( vma2 ; @xcite ) , the source of the heavy elements had never been observationally identified and the closely orbiting disk at g29 - 38 was the smoking gun .      in a seminal paper ,",
    "@xcite modeled the observed properties of g29 - 38 by invoking a tidally - destroyed minor planet ( i.e.   large asteroid ) that evolves into an opaque , flat ring of dust analogous to the rings of saturn .",
    "the particles are heated by the star , producing an infrared excess , and slowly dragged down onto the stellar surface , polluting its otherwise - pristine atmosphere with heavy elements .",
    "the tidally - disrupted asteroid model has seen continued success since its inception , and is considered the standard model for metal - enriched white dwarfs . in the intervening decade ,",
    "an enormous amount of observational progress has occurred ( for a detailed review , see @xcite ) , all of which supports the accretion of asteroid - like debris in dynamically active , post - main sequence planetary systems @xcite .",
    ".multi - wavelength fluxes and upper limits for g29 - 38[tbl1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     _ note_. fluxes are _ galex _ far- and near - ultraviolet @xcite , ground - based @xmath9 @xcite , _ spitzer _ irac , irs 16 and mips 24@xmath8 m photometry @xcite . also listed are @xmath10 upper limits from mips 70@xmath8 m photometry @xcite , and the similar pacs and alma limits reported here .",
    "all successful models for disks at white dwarfs invoke tidally - destroyed planetary bodies that originate in a more distant and substantially more massive reservoir of planetesimals @xcite . to date , there have been no indications of cooler dust associated with an outlying planetesimal population around metal - polluted white dwarfs , but the longest wavelength observations conducted for a substantial number of stars are both _ wise _",
    "22@xmath8 m and _ spitzer _ mips 24@xmath8 m photometry @xcite .",
    "these data only probe for dust at radii of 1 to a few au for typical @xmath11k white dwarfs , and thus longer wavelength data are needed to search for populations analogous to the asteroid and kuiper belts of the solar system .",
    "this paper presents _ herschel _ @xcite far - infrared and alma submillimeter observations of g29 - 38 ( zzpsc , wd2326@xmath12049 ) .",
    "this iconic stellar remnant has a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere of @xmath13k , intrinsic brightness @xmath14 , and a cooling age near 380myr @xcite . at 13.6pc ,",
    "g29 - 38 is the nearest example of a disk - polluted white dwarf and also the brightest by an order of magnitude , making it ideal for long wavelength observations sensitive to cold dust emission , and where a ring of @xmath15au diameter would span @xmath16 on the sky and be potentially resolved .",
    "both sets of observations resulted in null detections , and provide limits on cold dust masses similar to known kuiper belt objects .",
    "the observations and data analysis details are presented in  2 , from which are derived sensitivities to fractional dust luminosity , and similarly to dust masses , as a function of temperature and orbital radius for all existing @xmath17 m observations .",
    "the results are presented in  3 together with a comparison of these data and sensitivities with known dusty a - type stars , which represent possible progenitors of the g29 - 38 system .",
    "g29 - 38 was targeted by the _ herschel space observatory _ on 2012 june 6 with the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) at 100 and 160@xmath8 m . these data are particularly sensitive to 20k dust in the 10au region , where any emission at these wavelengths is expected to be unresolved at the @xmath18@xmath8 m diffraction limit of a 3.5 m telescope .",
    "while circumstellar dust orbiting beyond @xmath19au can be spatially resolved around nearby stars with _ herschel _",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , the very low luminosity of a cool white dwarf like g29 - 38 makes such a detection unlikely ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the source was expected to be substantially fainter than the 50mjy limit recommended for standard chop - nod observations , and thus the mini - scan map mode was used .",
    "these were executed in three pairs of cross - scans , using individual cross - scan angles of 70and 110 , and each of the six segments repeated 25 times for an on - source time of 1800s . in total , g29 - 38 was observed for 3.0hr on source and with 9.4hr observatory time .",
    "the pacs data were reduced using the _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ( hipe ) version 7.0 .",
    "the data were processed using the standard pacs photometer processing steps , and maps were made using the photproject task .",
    "the data were high - pass filtered in the scan direction with filter width of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( equivalent to 16 and 25 frames ) in the 100 and 160@xmath8 m bands respectively .",
    "the fully reduced images are shown in figure [ fig1 ] alongside _ spitzer _ imaging detections in the mid - infrared .",
    "the source was assumed to be point - like and photometry was performed using apertures .",
    "source apertures with radii of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24fwhm , which is near optimal for a point source ) were used for the 100 and 160@xmath8 m bands respectively .",
    "the field background and 1@xmath25 noise were obtained by taking the median and standard deviation of multiple apertures , with radii equal to that of the source apertures , located within @xmath26 of the source location respectively .",
    "the measured fluxes ( @xmath27mjy ) , and sum in noise apertures ( @xmath28mjy ) , have all had aperture corrections applied ; 1.94 and 1.90 for the 100 and 160@xmath8 m bands respectively .",
    "the derived upper limits for g29 - 38 are the flux measured in the source apertures @xmath29 , and are listed in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "[ fig2],width=241 ]      g29 - 38 was also observed with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) as part of early science operations at the beginning of cycle 0 in 2011 november .",
    "data were acquired over the course of several nights , with two 17min observations on 18 and 26 november in band 6 ( 230ghz , 1305@xmath8 m ) , and five 23 minutes observations on 6 , 14 , and 16",
    "november in band 7 ( 345ghz , 870@xmath8 m ) . during the brief time span of the observations ,",
    "the proper motion of g29 - 38 was negligible for the concatenation of datasets .",
    "all but two observations were made using 15 antennas , but a single observation in each of band 6 and 7 was made with 17 and 14 antennas respectively .",
    "the spatial configuration of the array provided baselines covering a range from 10 to 150 m .",
    "initial calibrations and pointing were done on the bright quasars 3c454.3 and 3c446 , while neptune was used for absolute flux calibration .",
    "the science observations were interleaved with the phase calibrator j2323@xmath30032 .",
    "the observing setup was the most sensitive for continuum observations , using the wide - band tdm mode with 128 15625mhz wide spectral channels , 2mhz bandwidth per polarization , and resulting in a full effective bandwidth of 7.5mhz .",
    "upper limits are listed in table [ tbl1 ] and discussed in  2 .",
    "the dotted line is a stellar atmosphere model , the dashed line is a face - on , flat and optically thick ring model ( @xmath31k , @xmath32k ) fitted to the warm disk continuum emission , and the solid line the measured strong silicate feature in the _ spitzer _ irs sl spectrum @xcite . [ fig3],width=317 ]    the data were processed by the alma pipeline and the achieved rms values were 0.071mjy / beam in band 6 and 0.056mjy / beam in band 7 ; these were adopted as the @xmath33 noise values .",
    "no sources were detected in either band , and upper limits for unresolved emission from the science target were taken to be @xmath10 and are listed in table [ tbl1 ] . using the common astronomy software applications package , a band 6 and 7 , beam - combined image was created to increase the chance of source detection using the increased signal and spectral information .",
    "no emission from the science target is evident in these merged down to @xmath34mjy .",
    "the beam - combined image is displayed in figure [ fig2 ] , and is overplotted with the band 7 beam size ( @xmath35 at position angle 1.63 ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] details the spectral energy distribution of g29 - 38 , extending from the ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths . the stellar photosphere is detected from the far - ultraviolet until the near - infrared , where the spatially unresolved emission of the inner disk dominates at @xmath36@xmath8 m .",
    "of the suite of available data , the alma observations had the best ability to spatially resolve any emission from dust , but only for relatively cold and distant material beyond 11au .",
    "following @xcite , all the available infrared and submillimeter upper limit @xmath37 at g29 - 38 were transformed into limiting fractional disk luminosities as a function of dust temperature and corresponding orbital radius using    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the distance to the star , @xmath40 the orbital radius of dust grains of temperature @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the planck function .",
    "the factor @xmath43 allows for the faster falloff in emission towards longer wavelengths for non - blackbody ",
    "smaller , warmer yet more distant grains @xcite .",
    "these upper limit fractional dust luminosities are plotted as colored curves in figure [ fig4 ] for the _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , and alma observations .",
    "also included in the plot is a similar curve for the most compact configuration of the expanded very large array ( evla ) at 45ghz , with a @xmath44 beam , and a 5.6@xmath8jy continuum sensitivity @xcite .",
    "any blackbody dust grains with temperature below approximately 20k would be orbiting beyond 11au and hence be spatially resolved to some degree in the alma observations , which had a band 7 beam diameter between 15 and 18 , and thus capable of resolving ring structures with radii larger than @xmath45au at 13.6pc ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the plotted alma sensitivities were corrected for such resolved cases by assuming a face on disk and dividing by the number of beams per ring circumference .",
    "the sensitivities of the _ herschel _ observations were similarly corrected for dust located beyond @xmath19au , but it is worth noting that such high fractional luminosities 1 ) lie above the figure [ fig4 ] plots and can not be assumed to be optically thin , and 2 ) would have been detected as spatially resolved emission with alma .",
    "also in figure [ fig4 ] are plotted model extrapolations for dusty a - type stars from @xcite , as their _ current _ dust properties would appear if the host stars were evolved into cool white dwarfs with parameters similar to g29 - 38 .",
    "to begin , the inferred orbital radii of the dust components on the main sequence were expanded by a factor @xmath46 , appropriate for g29 - 38 and a representative value for a stars based on the initial - to - final mass relations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this change not only leads to a change in dust grain temperatures , but also in their illumination .",
    "the amount of light intercepted by the dust decreases by @xmath47 , but the total emitting area of the dust _ increases _ because small grains are not removed by radiation pressure @xcite . on the main sequence",
    "the collisional cascade is truncated at a grain diameter that is approximately @xmath48 @xcite , and thus the emitting area and fractional luminosity is proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "following @xcite , considering the realistic emission properties of small grains illuminated by the faint white dwarf , only particles larger than 0.1@xmath8 m contribute significantly to the emission , and thus the change in fractional luminosity will be    @xmath50    notably , several of the brightest a - star debris disk projections were readily detectable in the alma ( but not _ herschel _ or _ spitzer _ ) observations , even with the modest number of antennae and corresponding limited sensitivity . however , it is important to note that these modeled points : 1 ) are based on disks orbiting relatively young , main sequence stars , 2 ) essentially preserve the mass of colliding planetesimals between stellar phases , and 3 ) allow arbitrarily cold dust , including temperatures below that supported by ambient interstellar radiation . a fixed minimum temperature for dust grains that is substantially warmer than the 3k cosmic microwave background will favorably impact their detectability with alma as such a disk will tend towards the more sensitive parts of the figure [ fig4 ] curves , while the assumption of no further collisional evolution nor dust depletion ( e.g.  wind drag or dynamical ) over the course of stellar evolution , are admittedly physically unrealistic .    while small dust grains would be removed during the asymptotic giant phase , they are quickly replenished by collisions .",
    "the collision rate of the largest surviving particles can be long , but the smallest grains are repopulated from the integrated collisions of all large bodies , resulting in a replenishment timescale equal to their depletion timescale in a steady state @xcite .",
    "still , detailed models for the post - main sequence evolution of kuiper belt analogs @xcite suggest that detecting these disks in cool white dwarf systems like g29 - 38 is challenging , primarily due to collisional depletion of the disc material .",
    "such collisional depletion would occur on even shorter timescales for asteroid belt analogs favored by the volatile poor abundance patterns seen via atmospheric pollution @xcite , including g29 - 38 in particular @xcite . and while searches for cold disks have been carried out with _",
    "spitzer _ in more favorable , hot ( pre-)white dwarf systems with relatively high stellar luminosity @xcite , the resulting picture is complicated by binarity and dusty outflows associated with their immediate progenitors @xcite .",
    "the stochastic planetesimal accretion models of @xcite place g29 - 38 among the top 1% of accretors in terms of incoming material , but it is also notable among da stars where instantaneous rates can be inferred from observed metal abundances . if white dwarf pollution were correlated with disk brightness on the main sequence , then g29 - 38 would have evolved from one of the brightest main sequence disks and thus imply the highest chance of cold dust detection among polluted white dwarfs .",
    "the fact that it is not detected , and the fact that the young dusty a star disks are predicted to be detectable in the absence of depletion of their belts , may support , but not strongly , the likelihood that such main sequence disks , on average , become depleted in dust as they progress significantly beyond their current , relatively young ages .",
    "these caveats notwithstanding , the analysis and figures indicate that in the absence of significant depletion , or in the case of where debris is replenished in these orbital regions ( e.g. @xcite ) , that alma is an excellent tool to both detect and spatially resolve disks at white dwarfs .",
    "giant impacts or instabilities analogous to the late heavy bombardment would substantially increase the detectability of planetesimal disks at white dwarfs , and cold dust can accumulate over long timescales due to the feeble stellar luminosity .",
    "another possibility that favors the retention of substantial disk mass is if the planetesimals have high eccentricity and thus a reduced collision rate @xcite .",
    "while the average planetesimal disk at white dwarfs may be depleted , some fraction of the population may remain salient .",
    "the final alma array of 66 dishes should more than double the sensitivity , all else being equal , and thus be capable of detecting circumstellar dust more representative of current a stars , as well as asteroid belt analogs , now cold and expanded beyond several au .",
    "m of 0.17mjy . for dust",
    "warmer than around 20k the emission is expected to remain spatially unresolved in the observations , while cooler dust would have been spread across many beams and thus the sensitivity drops accordingly .",
    "[ fig5],width=317 ]      to derive upper limits on the mass of dust present around g29 - 38 , the 870@xmath8 m observations were the most sensitive for realistic temperatures .",
    "emission at this wavelength traces predominantly millimeter sized dust particles and is most likely optically thin . in the absence of any detailed information on the composition and size of any grains associated with this source , the average value of dust opacity is adopted here , @xmath51@xmath52g@xmath53 at 870@xmath8 m , noting that the actual opacity may be anywhere in the range @xmath54@xmath52g@xmath53 @xcite .    using a radial dependence of the dust temperature identical to that derived in  3.1 and plotted in figure [ fig4 ] ,",
    "the adopted upper limit flux of @xmath55mjy / beam is converted to the dust mass using    @xmath56    a range of radial distances @xmath40 were explored , where dust emission falls within one half of the primary beam of a 12 m alma antenna at 870@xmath8 m , or up to 60au from the star .",
    "having no information on the radial or azimuthal distribution of dust , nor its projected distance in the plane of the sky , the calculations assume a simple , circular , and face - on ring of radial thickness much less than the beam size ( 22au at 13.6pc ) .",
    "spatially unresolved emission allows direct conversion from the observed flux to the mass of the dust using the above expression , while at @xmath57au the ring would become resolved and the observed flux per beam is then a fraction of the total flux in the ring .",
    "upper limits derived in this way are shown in figure [ fig5 ] , where only high dust masses greater than that of pluto ( @xmath58 g ) can be ruled out beyond 11au in the spatially resolved regime . in the case of unresolved emission within 11au , the upper limit dust masses are relatively low and comparable to a few times the mass of ceres ( @xmath59 g ) .    coincidentally ,",
    "the unresolved dust mass limits fall within a factor of a few of the highest known masses of metals residing in the outer layers of polluted white dwarfs with significant convection zones @xcite .",
    "however , there is no reason to expect a physical connection between collisionally generated dust masses in outer planetesimal belts ( which requires replenishment over appropriate timescales ) , and the amount of mass that is transported via ( presumably ) intact parent bodies to the tidal disruption radius , and later the stellar surface , of polluted white dwarfs .",
    "debris from the inferred parent population of planetesimals at g29 - 38 remains undetected with _ herschel _ pacs at 100 and 160@xmath8 m , and alma in early and relatively shallow observations at 870 and 1305@xmath8 m .",
    "while the alma observations were best suited to outer regions analogous to evolved kuiper belt analogs , the _ herschel _ data were uniquely sensitive to an evolved , asteroid - like belt at g29 - 38 and in general to dust at temperatures and orbital regions intermediate to the relatively warm dust seen at polluted white dwarfs and the cooler dust often detected at main sequence stars .",
    "the non - detection at g29 - 38 is not wholly unexpected , as disk evolution models supported by observations of main sequence stars predict that the available mass in both dust and parent bodies decreases significantly over timescales of several hundred myr @xcite , and this depletion is likely enhanced during the post - main sequence @xcite .",
    "these data collectively preclude a relatively bright , @xmath60 disk in the general vicinity of 10au around the nearest and brightest polluted white dwarf with an infrared excess . from orbital expansion alone ,",
    "a planetesimal belt currently in within 10au would have orbited within the terrestrial zone ",
    "interior to the water ice line  during the main sequence , and thus be consistent with the suspected source regions for parent bodies of the disk of disrupted and polluting material in g29 - 38 and a growing number of white dwarfs where detailed abundance measurements allow a robust assessment of their volatile content @xcite .",
    "therefore , any dusty asteroid - like belt must lie below these detection limits .",
    "however , recent work suggests that it is difficult for sufficient material to survive to the white dwarf phase in this inner region @xcite . a parent body origin in an outer",
    ", kuiper - like belt remains consistent with these long wavelength observations @xcite , but the volatile deficiency combined with substantial parent body masses , both inferred via atmospheric pollution remains to be explained .",
    "while significant uncertainty remains , alma is the only current facility able to empirically constrain the source regions for the parent bodies of the planetary debris surrounding and falling onto white dwarfs like g29 - 38 .",
