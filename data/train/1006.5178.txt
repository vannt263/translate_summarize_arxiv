    "in recent years , studies of quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have been greatly facilitated by dedicated large - scale wide and deep field surveys in different bands , most notably by optical surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) and the 2qz survey @xcite .",
    "indeed , the growing body of data has revolutionized the study of quasars and agns .",
    "large , homogeneous data sets allow detailed investigations of the phenomenological properties of quasars and agns , offering new insights into the central engine powering these objects and their connections to their host galaxies , especially when combined with multi - wavelength coverage . at the same time , it has become important to fit the quasar / agn population into its cosmological context , i.e. , how the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) population evolves across cosmic time .",
    "these data have led to a coherent picture of the cosmic evolution of the smbh population within the concordance @xmath2cdm paradigm @xcite , where the key observational components include quasar clustering , the luminosity function ( lf ) , the bh mass function , and the correlations between bhs and their host properties .",
    "increasingly larger data sets are offering unique opportunities to measure these properties with unprecedented precision .    in an earlier study of the virial bh mass and eddington ratio distributions of quasars , we measured spectral properties for the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) quasar catalog @xcite .",
    "we hereby extend this exercise to the dr7 quasar catalog @xcite .",
    "we now include a more complete compilation than before of quantities from our spectral fits .",
    "our measurements are more sophisticated than the sdss pipeline outputs in many ways , and are hence of practical value .",
    "we describe the parent quasar sample in  [ sec : sample ] , and the spectral measurements and the catalog format in  [ sec : spec_measure ] .",
    "we discuss possible applications of our measurements in  [ sec : app ] . throughout this paper",
    "we use cosmological parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the sdss uses a dedicated 2.5-m wide - field telescope @xcite with a drift - scan camera with 30 @xmath6 ccds @xcite to image the sky in five broad bands ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the imaging data are taken on dark photometric nights of good seeing @xcite , are calibrated photometrically @xcite and astrometrically @xcite , and object parameters are measured @xcite .",
    "quasar candidates @xcite for follow - up spectroscopy are selected from the imaging data using their colors , and are arranged in spectroscopic plates @xcite to be observed with a pair of fiber - fed double spectrographs .",
    "our parent sample is the latest compilation of the spectroscopic quasar catalog @xcite from sdss dr7 @xcite .",
    "this sample contains 105,783 bona fide quasars brighter than @xmath8 and have at least one broad emission line with fwhm larger than 1000 @xmath9 or have interesting / complex absorption features .",
    "about half of these objects are selected uniformly using the final quasar target selection algorithm described in @xcite , with the remaining objects selected via early versions of the target selection algorithm or various serendipitous algorithms ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the reduced one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectral data used in this study are available through the sdss data archive server ( das ) .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath10 , and the 1d spectra are stored in vacuum wavelength , with a pixel scale of @xmath11 in log - wavelength , which corresponds to @xmath12 . since the 6th sdss data release ( dr6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spectral flux calibration is scaled to the point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes of standard stars , therefore there is no longer need for a fiber - to - psf conversion for the spectral flux ( shen et al .",
    "2008 also used the psf spectral flux calibration ) . throughout the paper , we refer to the signal - to - noise ratio per pixel as s / n .    to include radio properties , we match the dr7 quasar catalog with the first @xcite catalog with a matching radius of 30 `` and estimate the radio loudness @xmath13 following @xcite , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the flux density ( @xmath16 ) at rest - frame 6 cm and @xmath17  , respectively .",
    "for the quasars that have only one first source within 30 '' we match them again to the first catalog with a matching radius 5 `` and classify the matched ones as core - dominant radio quasars .",
    "those quasars that have multiple first source matches within 30 '' are classified as lobe - dominated .",
    "the rest - frame 6 cm flux density is determined from the first integrated flux density at 20 cm assuming a power - law slope of @xmath18 ; the rest - frame @xmath17   flux density is determined from the power - law continuum fit to the spectrum as described in  [ sec : spec_measure ] . for lobe - dominated radio quasars",
    "we use all the matched first sources to compute the radio flux density .",
    "we note that we may have missed some double - lobed radio quasars with lobe diameter larger than 1.    to flag balqsos , we use the @xcite dr5 balqso catalog to set the civ  and mgii  balqso flags ( using their `` bi0 '' flags ) .",
    "we also visually inspected all the post - dr5 quasars with redshift @xmath19 to identify obvious civ  balqsos ( we may have missed some weak balqsos ) . we did not perform a systematic search for low - ionization mgii  balqsos because of the large number of quasars with mgii  coverage and the much rarer occurrence of mgii  balqsos .",

    "for the same set of data , different studies sometimes report different results for certain measured quantities due to the different line - measurement techniques used in these studies .",
    "which method is preferred , however , depends on the nature of the problem under study .",
    "a classic example is measuring the _ full - width - at - half - maximum _ ( fwhm ) in estimating the bh mass using virial estimators ,",
    "where the usual complications are : 1 ) how to subtract the continuum underneath the line ; 2 ) how to treat the narrow line component ( especially for mgii  and civ ) ; 3 ) how to measure the broad line profile , especially in the presence of noise and absorption .",
    "these choices crucially depend on the particular virial estimator calibrations used ; in particular , one must use a similar fwhm definition as was used in the virial estimator calibration , and new methods of fwhm measurements must be re - calibrated either against reverberation mapping ( rm ) masses or internally between different line estimators .",
    "on the other hand , different line - measurement methods have different sensitivities to the quality of the spectra ( spectral resolution and s / n ) , which introduce systematics when switching from high - quality to low - quality data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is beyond our scope to fully settle these issues within the current study .",
    "we remove the effects of galactic extinction in the sdss spectra using the @xcite map and a milky way extinction curve from @xcite with @xmath32 , and shift the spectra to restframe using the cataloged redshift as the systemic redshift . for each line",
    ", we fit a local power - law continuum ( @xmath33 ) plus an iron template @xcite to the wavelength range around the line that is not contaminated by the broad line emission . during the continuum@xmath34iron fitting",
    "we simultaneously fit five parameters : the normalization @xmath35 and slope @xmath36 of the power - law continuum , and the normalization @xmath37 , line broadening @xmath38 and velocity offset @xmath39 relative to the systemic redshift for the iron template fit . because of the moderate spectral quality of sdss spectra ( median s / n@xmath40 ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 are often poorly constrained ; nevertheless the iron fit gives a reasonably good estimate of the iron flux to be subtracted off .",
    "the continuum@xmath34iron fit is then subtracted from the spectrum , and the resulting line spectrum is modelled by various functions . in the case of h@xmath0  and h@xmath1",
    "the adjacent narrow emission lines , e.g. , [ oiii]@xmath204959,5007 , [ nii]@xmath206548,6584 , [ sii]@xmath206717,6731 , are also fit simultaneously .",
    "below we describe the detailed fitting procedures for the four broad lines .      for h@xmath0",
    "we use the optical iron template from @xcite , and we fit for objects with @xmath41 . the continuum@xmath34iron fitting windows are [ 6000,6250 ] and [ 6800,7000 ]  .    for h@xmath0  line",
    "fitting , we fit the wavelength range [ 6400,6800 ]  .",
    "the narrow components of h@xmath0 , [ nii]@xmath206548,6584 , [ sii]@xmath206717,6731  are each fit with a single gaussian .",
    "their velocity offsets from the systemic redshift and line widths are constrained to be the same , and the relative flux ratio of the two [ nii ]  components is fixed to @xmath42 .",
    "we impose an upper limit on the narrow line fwhm @xmath43 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the broad h@xmath0  component is modelled in two different ways : a ) a single gaussian with a fwhm @xmath44 ; b ) multiple gaussians with up to three gaussians , each with a fwhm @xmath45 .",
    "the second method yields similar results to the fits with a truncated gaussian - hermite function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "during the fitting , all lines are restricted to be emission lines ( i.e. , positive flux ) .",
    "for h@xmath1  we use the optical iron template from @xcite , and we fit for objects with @xmath46 . the continuum@xmath34iron fitting windows are [ 4435,4700 ] and [ 5100,5535 ]  . for the h@xmath1  line",
    "fitting , we follow a similar procedure as h@xmath0  to fit for h@xmath1  and [ oiii]@xmath204959,5007 , where the line fitting wavelength range is [ 4700,5100 ]  . since the [ oiii]@xmath204959,5007  lines frequently show asymmetric blue wings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sometimes even more dramatic double - peaked profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we model each of the narrow [ oiii]@xmath204959,5007  lines with two gaussians , one for the core and the other for the blue wing",
    ". the flux ratio of the [ oiii ]  doublet is not fixed during the fit , but we found that the fitting results show good agreement with the theoretical ratio of about 3 .",
    "the velocity offset and fwhm of the narrow h@xmath1  line are tied to those of the core [ oiii]@xmath204959,5007components  component might have different width and velocity offset from those of the core [ oiii]@xmath204959,5007  components . usually in such cases",
    "our procedure still provides a reasonable approximation to subtract the narrow h@xmath1  component ; however , under rare circumstances where the narrow h@xmath1  component is not obvious this may lead to a biased narrow line subtraction .",
    "nevertheless , fitting the narrow h@xmath1  line without this constraint would significantly degrade the reliability of narrow line subtraction .",
    "] , and we impose an upper limit of @xmath47 on the narrow line fwhm . as in the h@xmath0  case , the broad h@xmath1  component is modelled in two ways : either by a single gaussian , or by multiple gaussians with up to three gaussians , each with a fwhm @xmath48 .",
    "the single gaussian fit to the broad component is essentially the same to the procedure in @xcite , and is somewhat similar to the procedure in @xcite .",
    "however , in many objects the broad h@xmath0/h@xmath1  component can not be fit perfectly with a single gaussian ; and fwhms from the single gaussian fits are systematically larger by @xmath49 dex than those from the multiple gaussian fits ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the additional multiple gaussian fits for the broad h@xmath0/h@xmath1  component provide a better fit to the overall broad line profile , and the fwhm measured from the model flux can be used in customized virial calibrations .",
    "it is unclear , however , which fwhm is a better surrogate for the true virial velocity , that is , the one that yields the smallest scatter in the calibration against rm black hole masses .",
    "for mgii  we use the uv iron template from @xcite , and we fit for objects with @xmath50 . the continuum@xmath34iron fitting windows are [ 2200,2700 ]   and [ 2900,3090 ]  .",
    "we then subtract the pseudo - continuum from the spectrum , and fit for the mgiiline over the [ 2700,2900 ]   wavelength range , with a single gaussian ( with @xmath51 ) for the narrow mgiicomponent , and for the broad mgii  component with : 1 ) a single gaussian ; 2 ) multiple gaussians with up to three gaussians .",
    "again , the multiple - gaussian fits often provide a better fit to the overall broad mgiiprofile ; but we have retained the fwhms from a single gaussian fit in order to use the mgii  virial mass calibrations in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some mgii  virial estimator calibrations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the spectral quality is sufficient to see the bifurcation of the mgii  doublet around the peak .",
    "the locations of the two peaks indicate that they are associated with the mgii@xmath202796,2803 doublet , and the fact that they are resolved means that the fwhm of each component is @xmath54 , hence they are most likely associated with the narrow line region . on the other hand , such cases are rare and most sdss spectra do not have adequate s / n to unambiguously locate the narrow mgii  doublet . associated narrow mgii  absorption troughs can further complicate the situation by mimicing two peaks .",
    "hence although our approach of fitting a single gaussian to the narrow mgii  component is not perfect , it nevertheless accounts for some narrow mgii  contamination .",
    "fig.[fig : comp_mgii_wang09 ] compares our broad mgii  fwhm measurements with those from @xcite for the objects in both studies .",
    "although we have used a different approach , our results are consistent with theirs , with a mean offset @xmath55 dex .",
    "this systematic offset between our results and theirs is caused by the fact that they are treating the broad mgii  line as a doublet as well , while we ( and most studies ) are treating the broad mgii  line as a single component .        ,",

    "iron emission is generally weak for civ , and most of our objects do not have the spectral quality sufficient for a reliable iron template subtraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the power - law continuum fitting windows are : [ 1445,1465 ]   and [ 1700,1705 ]  .",
    "we found fitting civ  with iron subtraction does not change the fitted civ  fwhm significantly , but does systematically reduce the civ  ew by @xmath55 dex because the iron flux under the wings of the civ  line is accounted for . at the same time , fitting iron emission increases the uncertainty in the fitted continuum slope and normalization , due to imperfect subtraction of the iron flux .",
    "therefore we report our civ  measurements without the iron template fits , and emphasize that the civ  ews may be overestimated by @xmath57 dex on average .",
    "the continuum subtracted line emission within [ 1500,1600 ]   was fitted with three gaussians ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and we measure the line fwhm from the model fit . to reduce the effects of noise spikes , we reject any gaussian component having flux less than @xmath52 of the total model flux when computing the fwhm .",
    "however , unlike some attempts in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we do not subtract a narrow civ  component because : 1 ) it is still debatable if a strong narrow civ  component exists for most quasars , or if it is feasible to do such a subtraction ; 2 ) existing civ  virial estimators are calibrated using the fwhms from the entire civ  profile @xcite .",
    "many civ  lines are affected by narrow or broad absorption features . to reduce the effects of such absorption on the civ  fits , we mask out @xmath53 outliers below the 20-pixel boxcar - smoothed spectrum during our fits ( to remedy for narrow absorption features )",
