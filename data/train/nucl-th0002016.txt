    "recent experiments at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility have measured the @xmath0 structure function of the deuteron for momentum transfers up to 6 ( gev / c)@xmath1 @xcite , and measurements for @xmath2 are planned . at such large momentum transfers , a relativistic description of the deuteron is required .",
    "one approach that gives such a description is light - front dynamics , which we will examine here . to separate the effects of the using light - front dynamics from the effects of the model , we choose to use the massive wick - cutkosky model",
    "this is a `` toy model '' investigation , instead of the full nuclear theory calculation . using this model ,",
    "the light - front hamiltonian approach is used to solve for the bound - state wavefunction .",
    "the results of our calculation can then be compared to other calculations done with the same model but different approaches .",
    "the simplest observable that can be compared is the relationship between the bound - state mass and the coupling constant .",
    "the utility of the light - front dynamics was first discussed by dirac @xcite .",
    "we start by expressing the four - vector @xmath3 in terms of the light - front variables @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "this is simply a change of variables , but an especially convenient one . using this coordinate system and defining the commutation relations at equal light - front time ( @xmath6 )",
    ", we obtain a light - front hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is used in the light - front schrdinger equation to solve for the ground state .",
    "there are many desirable features of the light - front dynamics and the use of light - front coordinates .",
    "first of all , high - energy experiments are naturally described using light - front coordinates .",
    "the wave front of a beam of high - energy particles traveling in the ( negative ) three - direction is defined by a surface where @xmath7 is ( approximately ) constant . such a beam can probe the wavefunction of a target described in terms of light - front variables @xcite : the bjorken @xmath8",
    "variable used to describe high - energy experiments is simply the ratio of the plus momentum of the struck constituent particle to the total plus momentum ( @xmath9 ) of the bound state . secondly , the vacuum for a theory with massive particles can be very simple on the light front .",
    "this is because all massive particles and anti - particles have positive plus momentum , and the total plus momentum is a conserved quantity .",
    "thus , the nave vacuum ( with @xmath10 ) is empty , and diagrams that couple to this vacuum are zero .",
    "this greatly reduces the number of non - trivial light - front time - ordered diagrams .",
    "thirdly , the generators of boosts in the one , two , and plus directions are kinematical , meaning they are independent of the interaction .",
    "thus , even when the hamiltonian is truncated , the wavefunctions will transform correctly under boosts .",
    "thus , light - front dynamics is useful for describing form factors at high momentum transfers .",
    "a drawback of the light - front formalism is that the hamiltonian is not manifestly rotationally invariant , since the generators of rotations about the one and two directions are dynamical .",
    "a study of the effects of the loss of rotational invariance of the excited states in the model being used here was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that there is less breaking of the degeneracy in the spectrum when higher order potentials are used as opposed to lower order potentials .",
    "there are other approaches that can be used to obtain relativistic wavefunctions and bound - state energies , including the feynman - schwinger representation ( fsr ) of the two - particle green s function@xcite and the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) @xcite .",
    "the fsr is useful since it can be constructed so it is equivalent to the bethe - salpeter equation using a kernel where _ all _ two - particle - to - two - particle ladder and crossed ladder diagrams are included .",
    "however , it requires a path integral to be done numerically , so it is computationally intensive to obtain an accurate answer .",
    "the fsr result is to be considered the full solution that the bethe - salpeter and hamiltonian equations approximate .",
    "the bse can be solved much quicker than the fsr , however a truncation of the bse kernel is required , causing the bse results to differ from the fsr results .",
    "it is well known that any finite truncation of the kernel yields bound - state wavefunctions with problems , such as the incorrect one - body limit @xcite .",
    "for our scalar model the potential is always attractive , so truncation of the kernel gives binding energies that are too small @xcite .",
    "another approach is explicitly covariant light - front dynamics @xcite , where manifest covariance is kept at the price of using a null - plane whose orientation is not fixed .    here",
    "we study light - front dynamics because of its close connection to experimental observables .",
    "using field theory , light - front potentials can be derived that give results physically equivalent to those of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "we define `` physically equivalent '' in section [ tbe : sbsec ] .",
    "depending on the diagrams used to construct the potential , one can argue that certain potentials are physically equivalent to the bethe - salpeter equations with certain kernels .",
    "the best that these potentials can do is reproduce the results of the corresponding bethe - salpeter equations . on the other hand",
    ", light - front potentials can be constructed that attempt to incorporate non - perturbative physics .",
    "it is possible that these potentials can give results that agree with the full theory results better than the bethe - salpeter equation using low - order kernels .",
    "we will consider both types of potentials in this paper , and see how well they perform .",
    "a brief discussion about the approximation used is in order .",
    "it is well known that the vacuum of the full wick - cutkosky model is unstable @xcite due to the cubic coupling which provides the interaction .",
    "however , when the bound - state calculation is restricted to the two - particle sector , the quenched approximation is used , and the self - energy and vertex - renormalization diagrams are neglected , the theory has a well defined ground state . in this paper",
    ", we compare the results of our light - front hamiltonian calculation to the bethe - salpeter and fsr calculations , both of which use the same approximations .",
    "the use of these simplifying approximations allows us to highlight the differences between the various approaches .",
    "the inclusion of the self - energy diagrams and counterterms for the light - front hamiltonian @xcite and for the fsr @xcite will not be discussed here .",
    "the objective of this paper is to obtain the bound - state energy for the ground state in our theory . in our model ,",
    "neutral scalar nucleons interact via a yukawa interaction , which is mediated by a neutral scalar meson .",
    "the light - front hamiltonian derived from the lagrangian is used in the light - front schrdinger equation for a two - nucleon bound state .",
    "the rules for light - front time - ordered perturbation theory ( lftopt ) are then derived for this schrdinger equation , along with the feynman rules for the effective potential .",
    "all of this is discussed in more detail in section [ ourmodel ] .",
    "the full potential for the light - front schrdinger equation is given by an infinite sum of diagrams .",
    "using the lftopt rules in section [ apptrunc ] , we derive the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) and two - boson - exchange ( tbe ) potentials , where the diagrams that give rise to mass and vertex renormalization are not included . the two - boson - exchange stretched - box ( tbe : sb ) diagrams , a subset of the tbe diagrams ,",
    "are used to construct the tbe : sb potential , and the utility of this potential is commented on . after the discussion of the perturbative potentials , we define several potentials in section [ appphys ] which attempt to incorporate non - perturbative physics in a obe type of potential .",
    "three potentials are obtained by approximating the obe potential directly ( giving the symmetrized mass , instantaneous , and retarded potentials ) , and one potential is obtained by approximating the bethe - salpeter equation and reducing it to a three - dimensional equation ( giving the modified - greens - function potential ) .    in section",
    "[ results ] , the potentials are used to numerically obtain the spectra , the coupling constant versus bound - state mass curves .",
    "this is done by solving the light - front schrdinger equation with each of the truncated potentials ( obe , tbe , and tbe : sb ) , and the approximate potentials ( symmetrized mass , instantaneous , retarded , and modified - greens - function ) .",
    "we compare these results to those in the literature obtained with other approaches .",
    "we summarize our findings in section [ conclusions ] . only a few low - order terms from the perturbative potentials are needed to approximate the results of the physically equivalent bethe - salpeter equations @xcite . since the light - front potentials are calculated without including the mass and vertex renormalization diagrams , the bethe - salpeter kernels used also do not include those diagrams .",
    "since the interaction in the wick - cutkosky model is strictly attractive , the spectra calculated using the perturbative potentials will underestimate the the binding energy compared with the spectra for the physically equivalent bethe - salpeter equations . as progressively higher - order terms in the potential",
    "are kept , the spectra calculated will agree better with the bse spectra .",
    "however , when a truncated kernel is used in the bethe - salpeter equation , the solutions obtained are known to be a poor approximation of the full solution @xcite , which for our theory ( where no renormalization graphs are kept ) is given by the feynman - schwinger representation of the green s function @xcite .",
    "hence , our truncated potentials can not give the full results .",
    "the non - perturbative approximations of the potential give spectra that more closely match the spectrum of the full solution .",
    "this suggests that these approximations are reproducing the physics more accurately than the perturbative potentials .",
    "the conventions and notations employed in this paper are summarized in appendix [ notation ] .",
    "the conversion of the light - front schrdinger equation into matrix form suitable for numerical evaluation is discussed in appendix [ numericaleq ] .",
    "azimuthal - angle integrations of the obe potentials , which help simplify the evaluation of the bound - state wavefunctions , are given in appendix [ angint ] .",
    "the loop integrations and azimuthal - angle integrations needed for the tbe potentials are discussed in appendix [ loopints ] .",
    "a check of the validity of the uncrossed approximation used in section [ sect:3dred ] is done in appendix [ uxcheck ] .",
