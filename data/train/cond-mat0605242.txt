    "recent experimental and theoretical investigations of dilute ferromagnetic semiconductors are concentrated mostly on ii - vi and iii - v materials doped with mn impurities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the theoretical explanation is based on the vonsovskii - zener model , which implies existence of a direct exchange interaction between the localized spins of magnetic ions ( mn ) and itinerant spins of free carriers ( holes in case of ( ga , mn)as and related materials).@xcite this interaction generates rkky - type indirect exchange between mn ions , and the latter is claimed to be the source of long - range fm order in dilute magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) alloys .",
    "it was shown recently that the kinematic exchange interaction ( specific version of superexchange between localized mn moments via empty valence states of the host material ) arises in @xmath1-type iii - v dms.@xcite this mechanism works together with the rkky interaction because of the noticeable hybridization between d - electrons of mn ions and p - holes near the top of the valence band .",
    "both mechanisms are characterized by a direct proportionality between the carrier concentration and curie temperature @xmath2 .",
    "however , it was pointed out recently@xcite that an application of the rkky based model to disordered dms may be questionable if one properly takes oscillating character of the rkky interaction into account .    meanwhile",
    ", another family of dilute ferromagnetic alloys was discovered during the recent five years , where the ferromagnetic order with a high @xmath2 exists in spite of the low carrier concentration .",
    "the ferromagnetic order was observed even in the insulating materials with carriers frozen out at @xmath3 .",
    "these are metal oxides doped with transition metal ions ( see , e.g. , ref . for a review ) .",
    "the absence of free carriers leaves no room for a rkky interaction in this case , so the question about the origin of ferromagnetism arises anew .",
    "the metal oxides like zno , sno@xmath0 , tio@xmath0 are classified as wide - gap semiconductors . in this sense",
    "they are close to the wide - gap iii - v nitrides gan and aln .",
    "we analyzed the case of @xmath4-(ga , mn)n in ref .",
    ", where the leading interaction mechanism is the zener type double exchange @xcite vie empty states in the impurity band . magnetic ions ( mi ) in all these compounds substitute for metallic cations . from this point of view , the difference between the two groups is in the charge state of substitutional impurity : the neutral state of an impurity should be mi@xmath5 in nitrides and mi@xmath6 in oxides .",
    "this difference implies different structures of spin multiplets , which is important for the magnetic properties of metallic alloys .",
    "however , due to a noticeable covalency of the host materials , mi should saturate the broken bonds by its own valent electrons , which are donated by the 3d shells .",
    "this means that the violation of the electronic structure inserted by the dopants can not be ignored in the studies of magnetic properties of dms .",
    "moreover the recent paper @xcite emphasizes the role of bound exciton states in zno bases compounds and indicates the correlation between between the experimentally observed chemical trends in ferromagnetism and the electron binding energies to various mi .    among the most salient features of magnetism in dilute ferromagnetic oxides one should mention an extreme sensitivity of the magnetic order to the growth and annealing conditions.@xcite we believe that this is an integral feature of magnetism in these materials , and the ferromagnetic ordering with high @xmath2",
    "is mediated by intrinsic or extrinsic defects , which form complexes with magnetic dopants .",
    "such point of view is supported by recent experimental studies of co- doped@xcite and cr - doped@xcite tio@xmath0 .",
    "it was noticed , in particular , that in the most perfect @xmath7 crystals the hysteresis loop at a given temperature is essentially less distinct than in bad quality samples.@xcite besides , the enormous scatter of effective magnetic moment per cation is observed in all ferromagnetic oxides , and the concentration of magnetic dopants lies far below the percolation threshold @xmath8 associated with the nearest - neighbor cation coupling.@xcite basing on these facts , one concludes that non - magnetic defects are also involved in formation of the localized magnetic moments .",
    "they influence their magnitude and localization , and this influence is sensitive to the growth and annealing regimes .",
    "recent theories of magnetism in @xmath4-type dilute magnetic oxides appeal to magnetic polarons as mediators of indirect exchange between magnetic dopants.@xcite in this case the _ extrinsic _ defects are donor impurities , which donate free electrons occupying the bottom of conduction band .",
    "these electrons form shallow spin - polarized polaronic states due to strong exchange with the localized magnetic moments of transition metal dopants .",
    "a large radius of these states makes the polaronic percolation threshold essentially lower than @xmath8 .",
    "one should note , however , that the carrier concentration in these compounds is vanishingly small , and that is why they have been proposed to be called dilute magnetic dielectrics ( dmd).@xcite it means that we need now to find an exchange mechanism , which works in the case of really insulating oxides . in this paper",
    "we construct a model of insulating oxide , which considers _ intrinsic _ non - magnetic defects as an integral part of the ordering mechanism .",
    "we concentrate mainly on the superexchange between magnetic ions mediated by oxygen vacancies , which is believed to be the source of ferromagnetic order in tio@xmath0 diluted with co.@xcite",
    "as has been established three decades ago , @xcite the basic microscopic hamiltonian , which gives an adequate quantitative and qualitative description of electronic and magnetic properties of semiconductors doped by transition metal ions is the anderson hamiltonian @xcite ( see summarizing monographs @xcite ) .",
    "indirect rkky @xcite , superexchange and double exchange @xcite interactions between magnetic ions may be derived microscopically from the multisite generalization of the anderson model.@xcite the hamiltonian of this model reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 describes the electronic structure of the host semiconductor , @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of strongly interacting electrons in the @xmath12-shells of magnetic ions located in the lattice sites @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the hybridization hamiltonian describing the covalent bonding between the impurity @xmath15-electrons and the host @xmath1 electrons ( the contribution of hybridization with the host @xmath16 electrons in the effective exchange is generally negligibly small ) .",
    "usually the direct @xmath17 exchange is neglected in the anderson model , since the indirect exchange coupling dominates in the covalent materials.@xcite    from the point of view of the anderson model , the crucial difference between the narrow - gap and wide - gap semiconductors is in the position of d - levels of the impurity electrons relative to the top of the valence band . due to a strong electron - electron interaction in the @xmath15 shell ( coulomb blockade ) , the impurity energy level @xmath18 should be defined as an `` addition energy '' for the reaction @xmath19 , i.e. the energy cost of adding one more electron , @xmath20 , from the band continuum to the impurity 3d - shell , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total energy of a `` pseudo - ion '' consisting of an impurity in a configuration @xmath23 and distorted electron distribution in the host semiconductor @xcite .    in this definition",
    "the energy is counted from the top of the valence band , which is the source of additional electrons for the impurity .",
    "it is known , e.g. that mn , the most popular magnetic impurity , has especially deep @xmath12 level corresponding to the half - filled @xmath12 shell in the configuration @xmath24 .",
    "this level is always occupied in such narrow - band semiconductors as ( ga , mn)as , ( ga , mn)p , ( in , mn)as .",
    "this means that the addition energy @xmath25 is well below the energy , @xmath26 , of the top of the valence band . on the contrary , @xmath27 in the wide gap semiconductors like gan,@xcite and",
    "the occupation of this state depends on the type and concentration of other defects .",
    "one should compare this picture with the energy spectra of magnetically doped metal oxides .",
    "situation with the transition metal impurities in zno is apparently close to that in gan .",
    "both these materials are wide band gap semiconductors , and the only difference is that the neutral state of magnetic impurity in zno is mi@xmath28 . the corresponding energy levels arise , as a rule , within the band gap , and the states with other oxidation numbers may appear only due to an additional @xmath4 - or @xmath1 - doping .    the calculation@xcite of addition energies for mi@xmath29 states in rutile tio@xmath0 has shown that the `` energy levels '' @xmath18 for neutral mi@xmath6 states are usually deep in the valence band for heavy transition metal ions ( starting with mn ) , whereas the condition @xmath27 is fulfilled for the addition energies of charged mi@xmath5 and mi@xmath28 ions .",
    "recent lsda+u calculations @xcite for anatase tio@xmath0 doped with mn , fe and ni are in a general agreement with those earlier cluster calculations .",
    "this means that the ground state of this system should be tio@xmath0:mi@xmath6 .",
    "in this situation the anderson hamiltonian may be immediately transformed into the @xmath30-exchange model by means of the schrieffer - wolff transformation . in the absence of free carriers",
    "the short - range effective inter - impurity exchange interaction is exponentially weak and there is no chance for magnetic ordering with reasonably high @xmath2 .",
    "however , the situation in real materials is quite different . leaving aside early results for the samples with secondary phase inclusions,@xcite we concentrate on the recent data for the materials , which are believed to be genuine ferromagnetic dmd free from magnetic",
    "as was mentioned above , the room temperature ferromagnetic order was detected in cr and co doped anatase tio@xmath0 , and in both cases native defects are involved in formation of the ferromagnetic order.@xcite in the latter case these defects are apparently oxygen vacancies .",
    "below , we adapt our theory@xcite for vacancy mediated indirect exchange .",
    "the case of ( ti , cr)o@xmath0 will be discussed in the concluding section .",
    "in the highly insulating ferromagnetic ( ti , co)o@xmath0 , magnetic ions are in co@xmath28 state.@xcite a seeming contradiction with the requirement of electrical neutrality of the substitutional impurities@xcite may be resolved , if one takes into account the intrinsic non - stoichiometry of the samples : oxygen vacancies v@xmath31 , are created in the process of sample preparation .",
    "it follows from the general neutrality consideration that an oxygen vacancy binds two electrons on a discrete level in the band gap to saturate the dangling bonds . in the process of annealing a noticeable amount of oxygen vacancies",
    "are captured by co substitution impurities in cation sites . in the case ,",
    "when @xmath32 arises in the octahedron containing a co ion , the double defect @xmath33 is formed , and its stability ( or metastability with respect to formation of @xmath34 complexes ) is determined by the charge transfer of these two electrons in accordance with the reaction @xmath35.\\ ] ] a presumable scheme of the energy levels , which substantiates such charge transfer is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the configurations @xmath36 of @xmath15 shells corresponding to different charge states of co and cr impurities are pointed out .",
    "the dashed band shows the position of vacancy - related levels below tho bottom of conduction band @xmath37 .",

    "we construct a microscopic model of impurity - vacancy complexes basing on our previous studies@xcite of double ferromagnetic exchange in ( ga , mn)as and the electronic structure of complexes cr - v@xmath31 in ( ga , cr)as,@xcite as well as on the numerical calculations of the electronic structure of @xmath32 defects in @xmath39  @xcite and doped non - stoichiometric ( oxygen deficient ) @xmath40   @xcite .",
    "the structure of hamiltonian , which describes the oxygen deficient ( ti , co)o@xmath0 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ and1 ] ) , but the oxygen vacancies should be taken into account in the host hamiltonian @xmath41 . we start with a quantum - chemical picture of an isolated defect cell , which contains both co impurity substituting for a ti cation and the vacancy in one of the apices of oxygen octahedra .",
    "we mark the cell by the index @xmath13 and consider the hamiltonian @xmath42 now the first term @xmath43 describes the host crystal with the vacancy , @xmath32 , in the cell @xmath13 .",
    "this hamiltonian may be diagonalized , and the resulting spectrum contains the band continuum distorted by the vacancy potential and the discrete levels @xmath44 for electrons bound on the dangling bonds in the defect cell .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath45 rewritten in this basis contains terms describing hybridization with both continuum and discrete states of @xmath43 .",

    "information about the vacancy - related states in anatase tio@xmath0 is rather scanty,@xcite so we refer to the data available for oxygen - deficient rutile tio@xmath0 . in accordance with numerical calculations@xcite , which correlate with the experimental observations",
    ", v@xmath31 creates donor levels @xmath56 a few tenth of an ev below the conduction band .",
    "the donor electrons saturate the dangling bonds with the neighboring atoms , so that the defect wave function has the largest amplitude at the next ti neighbor of the vacancy and extends to several coordination spheres .",
    "the extended defect states form a band of donor levels already for 1% concentration of oxygen vacancies , i.e. the wave functions of the vacancy states effectively overlap when the vacancies are separated by a distance of about 5 interatomic spacings .",
    "this observation will be used below when estimating the curie temperature .",
    "the calculated electronic structure for co - doped oxygen deficient anatase tio@xmath0 gives similar picture for the charge distribution and the density of states.@xcite    this observation verifies the model hamiltonian ( [ hyb ] ) for the co substitutional impurities .",
    "its form implies a strong nearest - neighbor hybridization between the vacancy and impurity related states .",
    "since the conduction band of tio@xmath0 is formed mainly by the @xmath12-states of ti sublattice , the matrix elements @xmath57 in the second term in this hamiltonian describe the hybridization of the co impurity @xmath12-states with those in the cationic sublattice .",
    "apparently one may neglect the hybridization @xmath57 in comparison with @xmath58 , and retain in this term only the hybridization @xmath59 with the oxygen - related p - states in the valence band .",
    "we return now to are the energy level scheme fig .",

    "these energies may be taken , i.g . from ref . .",
    "hybridization @xmath58 allows for an electron transfer of the two electrons from the vacancy level first to the level @xmath61 and then to the level @xmath62 and formation of the complex defect @xmath63_j$ ] with seven electrons occupying the 3d - shell of the ion @xmath64 and empty extended v@xmath65-related states",
    ".    indirect exchange interaction arises when the wave functions of two complexes centered in the cells @xmath13 and @xmath66 overlap .",
    "it is clear that the overlap is controlled by the radius of extended v@xmath65-related state .",
    "an obvious interaction mechanism is the superexchange , where two magnetic impurities exchange electrons via empty vacancy levels .",
    "it will be shown below that this interaction favors ferromagnetic ordering in the system .",
    "the simplest way to construct an effective superexchange interaction operator is to project the two - impurity hamiltonian @xmath67 onto the subspace @xmath68 , which arise due to the hybridization @xmath69 . here",

    "there is no hund interaction in the unfilled shell . as a result antiferromagnetic part of this interaction prevails ( ferromagnetic channels are blocked by the pauli principle).@xcite in our case",
    "the superexchange mechanism favors the ferromagnetic alignment of spins since the intrashell hund interaction suppresses the exchange by the electrons with antiparallel spins ( see next section ) .",
    "there seems to be much in common between the vacancy - related mechanism represented by eqs .",

    "the effective radius of magnetic interaction is controlled by the extended donor states .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that unlike the indirect exchange via the states in the donor impurity band@xcite , in our case the band of vacancy states may be empty ( provided all the electrons from the vacancy levels are captured by acceptor - like magnetic impurities ) , so that this mechanism may be realized in highly insulating materials . on the other hand , the empty donor band of extended vacancy related states plays , in oxygen deficient ( ti)o@xmath0 , the role similar to that played by the empty states in the hole pockets of @xmath1-type ( ga , mn)as in superexchange between magnetic ions ( see ref . ) .",
    "we will return to the comparison of superexchange mechanism in various dilute magnetic compounds in the concluding section .",
    "the simple estimate ( [ estim ] ) by means of the fourth order perturbation equation ( [ vert ] ) may be essentially improved . basing on the theory of _ isolated _ transition metal impurities in semiconductors,@xcite one may consider the effects of single - site hybridization between the @xmath12-orbitals of impurity and oxygen - related states in the valence band and vacancy levels and then use the perturbation theory approach for the _ intersite _ hybridization effects responsible for the superexchange .",

    "the term @xmath98 describing the subsystem of magnetic impurities in the hamiltonian ( [ and1 ] ) has the form @xmath99 here the site indices are introduced in accordance with the definition given in ( [ hyb ] ) , @xmath100 includes all the coulomb and exchange interactions responsible for the hund rule within the @xmath15-shells of co ions . in accordance with this rule",
    "the co d - shell contains seven electrons , five of which form the closed inert @xmath101 subshell and the remaining two electrons form the open active @xmath102 subshell .",
    "only the electrons in the open subshell are involved in the hybridization induced superexchange .",
    "the reason for this discrimination is the above mentioned swelling of the impurity electron wave functions due to the hybridization with the host electrons , which is stronger for the open subshell than for the closed one.@xcite    it is easily seen from ( [ vert ] ) that the fourth order transition @xmath103 for ferromagnetically aligned spins of two impurities is possible , whereas the similar process @xmath104 is suppressed due to the hund rule for the occupation of subshells . here",

    "the width of the vacancy band @xmath90 as well as the magnitude of hybridization parameter strongly depend on the specific characteristics of the sample ( vacancy concentration , annealing regime etc ) . besides , the vacancy band may or may be not partially filled due to uncontrollable donor impurities . taking for an estimate the average value of @xmath151 ev , assuming the same estimate for @xmath90 , and substituting the value of @xmath152 into eq .",
    "( [ curie ] ) one gets @xmath153ev",
    "@xmath154k for @xmath155 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath156 includes all the uncertainties ( degeneracy factor of vacancy and impurity levels , difference between the intracell and intercell hybridization parameters , uncertainties in the effective coordination number @xmath144 etc .",
    "we expect the factor @xmath156 to be ideally close to one .",
    "however , it may deviate , and even strongly , from this value depending on the preparation history of each particular sample .",
    "unfortunately , it is rather difficult to find optimal conditions for high @xmath2 in such a multifactor situation .",
    "among many dilute magnetic dielectrics only one example has been chosen , namely oxygen deficient @xmath146 , and it has been shown that the imperfection of this crystal is crucially important for the formation of a long - range magnetic order .",
    "this idea is supported by the recent experimental observation : ferromagnetism is suppressed in co doped @xmath39 film with high structural quality.@xcite similar correlations between the quality of films and the magnetism were discovered in ref . for @xmath157 .",
    "it follows directly from our theory that without additional defects creating shallow levels under the bottom of conduction band , the radius of magnetic correlation is too short to overcome the percolation threshold , so that improvement of the film quality is detrimental for magnetic ordering in dmd .",
    "it is also noticed in ref .",
    "that the charge state of chromium impurities in @xmath39 is @xmath158 .",
    "this fact is easily understood within the framework of our hypothesis about the origin of magnetic order in dmd .",
    "indeed , the difference between co and cr from the point of view of their electronic levels in host @xmath39 [ in fact , the addition energies defined in eq .",
    "( [ addit ] ) for the two impurities ] is the position of these levels relative to the shallow defect levels . in correlation with the experimental data on esr signal and theoretical calculations of the addition energies,@xcite",
    "the level of @xmath159 state in rutile @xmath39 is higher than the levels of shallow impurities and apparently higher than the bottom of conduction band .",
    "we assume that the situation is similar in anatase @xmath39 , so that the same charge transfer mechanism , which binds the ions @xmath160 with oxygen vacancies , should stabilize chromium impurities in a state @xmath161 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . it is worth also mentioning that generally we may expect that the chemical trends in the curie temperature for various transition metal impurities should correlate with the deep level energies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another experimental fact , which demands theoretical explanation is a strong sample dependent scatter of saturation magnetic moment @xmath162 , which also depends on the fabrication conditions.@xcite this fact may be easily explained if one recognizes that only part of oxygen vacancies is bound to magnetic impurities .",
    "`` free '' vacancies , @xmath163 , retain their electrons and eventually donate them to the vacancy band .",
    "the partially occupied band is spin polarized , and this polarization may enhance or partially compensate the magnetization of transition metal ions depending on the net sign of effective exchange in this band.@xcite    to conclude , we have proposed in this paper a mechanism of ferromagnetic exchange in dielectric non - stoichiometric @xmath164 doped with transition metal impurities , which involves the interaction between magnetic ions and oxygen vacancies and proposed a qualitative explanation of the basic properties of these materials .",
    "a quantitative calculations of electronic structure of magnetically doped @xmath39 based on the model described in this paper will be presented in forthcoming publications .",
