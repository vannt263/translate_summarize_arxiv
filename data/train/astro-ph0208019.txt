    "the effective temperature derived from @xmath15 by @xcite and @xcite is about 4850  k , but the effect of molecular absorption ( e.g. , ch bands ) in the blue range was not included in those works .",

    "using model atmospheres from @xcite at the adopted effective temperatures , we performed abundance analyses in the standard manner for the measured equivalent widths .",
    "surface gravities ( @xmath22 ) were determined from the ionization balance between fe i and fe ii , and the micro - turbulence ( @xmath23 ) was determined from the fe i lines by demanding no dependence of the derived abundance on equivalent widths .",
    "we found that the fe abundance of cs  29498043 is very low ( [ fe / h ] @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25(fe)@xmath26 ) , while the mg overabundance is quite large ( [ mg / fe ] @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28(mg)@xmath29 ) .",
    "this means that mg is an important electron source in the line - forming layer of the stellar atmosphere , and the effect of its overabundance must be included in the analysis .",
    "we iterated the abundance analysis so that the derived mg abundance is consistent with the one assumed in the calculation .",
    "the effect of the mg excess on the determination of the surface gravity is large ( @xmath30=0.4  dex ) ; if a higher mg abundance is assumed , the electron pressure is higher , and the ionization balance between fe i and fe ii demands a lower gravity . after taking into account a re - determination of the surface gravity ,",
    "the effect of the mg overabundance ( [ mg / fe ] = + 1.8 ) on the final abundances of the elements examined here is not significant ( e.g. , @xmath31[fe / h ] @xmath32 dex ) .",
    "a high overabundance of si ( [ si / fe ] = + 1.1 ) was also found , but its effect on the analysis is negligible .",
    "spectrum synthesis was applied to the c@xmath9 , cn , @xmath33ch , and @xmath34ch bands to determine the carbon and nitrogen abundances and the carbon isotope ratio .",
    "molecular data were from @xcite . for cs  29498043",
    ", we tried the analysis for the range @xmath35 [ o / fe ] @xmath36 , mindful of the large oxygen excess found in cs  22949037 @xcite , which may also apply to the present star .",
    "we found that the carbon abundance of cs  29498043 derived from the c@xmath9 swan 00 band is [ @xmath33c / fe ] = + 1.9 when [ o / fe]=2.0 is assumed , and changes by about 0.2  dex over the assumed range of [ o / fe ] .",
    "we have adopted these results for the carbon abundance and its error due to the uncertainty of the oxygen abundance .",
    "the nitrogen abundance of cs  29498043 was determined from the 01 band of the 4215   cn violet system to be [ n / fe ] = + 2.3 .",
    "a similar analysis was applied to cs  22957027 ; [ @xmath33c / fe ] = + 2.4 and [ n / fe ] = + 1.6 were derived , and found to be insensitive to the assumed oxygen abundance .",

    "line positions were calculated using the molecular constants of @xcite .",
    "the wavelengths of the @xmath34ch lines were adjusted by fitting the synthetic spectrum to the observed one for cs  22957027 , and were then applied to cs  29498043 .",
    "the @xmath33c/@xmath34c ratio estimated for cs  22957027 is 8 @xmath38 , which agrees reasonably with the value @xmath33c/@xmath34c = 10 derived by @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath33c/@xmath34c = 6@xmath38 was derived for cs  29498043 .",
    "though this ratio is formally lower than that of cs  22957027 , we can not insist on the reality of the difference .",
    "also , we can not conclude that the @xmath33c/@xmath34c of cs  29498043 is higher than the equilibrium value of the cno cycle ( @xmath39 ) , while that of cs  22957027 is obviously higher than the equilibrium value .",
    "a standard analysis was performed for most elements using measured equivalent widths .",
    "hyperfine splitting and isotope shifts were included in the analysis of lines , using the line list of @xcite , and adopting the isotope ratios of the solar - system _ r_-process component . the effect on the derived abundance is small ( @xmath40  dex ) because the ba lines are weak in these stars .",
    "the al and mn abundances were determined by spectrum synthesis from the al i 3961   and mn i 4030   lines , because these lines are contaminated by @xmath34ch and @xmath33ch lines ( @xmath37 band ) , respectively .",
    "since these blends involve ch doublets , the strength of each blending ch line can be estimated well from the other component .",
    "the results of the abundance analysis are given in table  [ tab : res ] .    to estimate the random errors , we first calculated the dispersion of the abundances for fe i lines in each star .",
    "we assumed the random error in _",
    "gf_-values to be 0.1  dex , and added it in quadrature to the above dispersion .",
    "the final random error in the mean adopted abundance for each element was evaluated by dividing by @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the number of lines used in the analysis , given in table  [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "errors arising from uncertainties of the atmospheric parameters were evaluated , for cs  22957027 , using @xmath43  k , @xmath44 , and @xmath45  km s@xmath11 . for cs  29498043 ,",
    "whose effective temperature is more uncertain as noted above , we also performed the abundance analyses assuming @xmath46  k and @xmath47  k , instead of the temperature @xmath48  k adopted above .",
    "we re - determined the surface gravity , metallicity , and micro - turbulence , and derived the elemental abundances for each effective temperature .",
    "we adopted the differences of the abundances derived from the three analyses as the errors due to the uncertainty of effective temperature for cs  29498043 .",
    "the errors arising from uncertainties of its surface gravity and microturbulence were evaluated using @xmath44 and @xmath49  km s@xmath11 .    finally , we derived the total uncertainty by adding in quadrature the individual errors , and list them in table [ tab : res ] .",
    "the error due to the uncertainty of the oxygen abundance assumed in the analysis is included in the total uncertainty of the carbon abundance of cs  29498043 .    corrections for nlte are not included in the present analysis .",
    "however , their effect is expected to be systematic , and the following discussion , based on the relative abundances between our objects and other metal - deficient stars , is not significantly affected .",
    "our analysis shows that cs  29498043 is an extremely metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath50 ) star with a large excess of c , n , mg , and si .",
    "these characteristics are similar to those of cs  22949037 @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : mgfe ] , their [ mg / fe ] values are shown as a function of [ fe / h ] , along with others from previous works compiled by norris et al .",
    "the [ mg / fe ] of cs  29498043 is clearly much higher than the average for other stars with similar [ fe / h ] , and is even higher than the already extreme cs  22949037 .",
    "the [ mg / fe ] of cs  22957027 follows the trend of the stars with similar [ fe / h ] , as studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : abpat ] shows the abundance differences ( [ x",
    "/ fe]@xmath51[x / fe]@xmath52 ) for cs  29498043 and cs  22949037 ( norris et al .",
    "2001 ) relative to the average values of the four stars cd@xmath5317504 , cd@xmath54254 , cs  22172 - 002 , and cs  22885 - 096 studied by @xcite , as a function of atomic number .",
    "excesses of c , n , mg , and si clearly appear in both cs  29498043 and cs  22949037 , while there is no clear evidence of departure of the relative abundances from zero for sc - ni .",
    "this suggests that similar nucleosynthesis processes contributed to the abundance patterns of these two stars .",
    "the high [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] values presumably indicate that the heavy elements from which these two stars formed came from supernovae whose outer layers ( where c and mg are produced ) escaped , but where relatively little material escaped from nearer the iron core .",
    "clearly , the nucleosynthesis mechanism is distinct from that in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars responsible for high c and s - process abundances in some , but not all , carbon - enhanced , metal - poor stars .",
    "while the excesses of si in cs  29498043 and cs  22957027 are similar , the excess of mg in cs  29498043 is noticeably larger than that of cs  22949037 ; the difference in [ mg / fe ] is 0.59  dex , significant at a 2.1-sigma level when we adopt the results of @xcite for cs  22949037 . ( the significance is 1.8-sigma if we adopt the result of depagne et al .",
    "the al abundance of cs  29498043 is also higher than that of cs  22949037 , although the uncertainty of the al abundance is large due to the contamination from the ch line and the strong ( but uncertain ) nlte effect for this element ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the small excess of the relative al abundance , a large enhancement of na was also found in cs  22949037 @xcite .",
    "studies of odd-@xmath55 elements like na and k in cs  29498043 are desirable to investigate the nucleosynthesis processes which produced its abundance pattern .",
    "measurement of its oxygen abundance , which has a large excess in cs  22949037 @xcite , is also of importance .",
    "the fraction of stars which are carbon - enhanced increases with decreasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy has been carried out for more than 10 carbon - rich stars with @xmath56[fe / h]@xmath57 . while some show large excesses of @xmath58-process elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , others show no such excess @xcite .",
    "no other carbon - rich object with such large excesses of mg and si as cs  29498043 is known ( aoki , et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) . however , only 4 objects with [ c / fe]@xmath59 are known in the metallicity range of [ fe / h ] @xmath60 .",
    "one is the carbon- and nitrogen - enhanced star cs  22957027 studied by @xcite , @xcite , and in the present work .",
    "another is the @xmath61-process - enhanced star cs  22892052 @xcite .",
    "the excesses of carbon and nitrogen of that object ( [ c / fe]@xmath62[n / fe]@xmath621.0 ) are much smaller than those of cs  22957027 , while the abundance pattern of the elements with @xmath63 is similar to those of the other objects with normal carbon abundances ( mcwilliam et al . 1995 ; norris et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "the other two known carbon - rich stars with [ fe / h]@xmath64 are cs  22949037 and cs  29498043 .",
    "these objects have lower iron abundances ( [ fe / h ] @xmath65 ) than cs  22957027 and cs  22892052 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath66 ) , and also have large excesses of mg and si , as shown here .",
    "though the sample is too small to permit definitive conclusions , the similarity of cs  22949037 and cs  29498043 suggests that other extremely metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath24 ) stars with carbon excess may also show a large enhancement of mg and si .",
    "since the ratio of carbon - rich objects seems to increase with decreasing metallicity , a number of objects similar to these two stars perhaps exist .",
    "further spectroscopic studies of candidate extremely metal - poor stars with strong ch and cn features are essential to investigate the nucleosynthesis processes in zero-(or very low- ) metallicity stars in the early galaxy .",
    "comparisons with theoretical predictions of yields ejected from supernovae will be presented separately in a future paper ; here we emphasize the importance of the discovery of cs  29498043 , which suggests the existence of a class of extremely metal - poor star with excesses of c , n , mg , and si .",
