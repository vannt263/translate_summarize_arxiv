    "this general solution is given in , with the corresponding spectrum of retardation times given in . in and , we specify and discuss the general solution for the boundary conditions appropriate for laser cutting and cyclic loading , respectively . in , we close with a discussion .",
    "we model the effectively one - dimensional stress fiber as a viscoelastic material which is subject to active myosin contraction forces and which interacts viscoelasticly with its surrounding . in the framework of continuum mechanics ,",
    "the fiber internal viscoelastic stress is given by the viscoelastic constitutive equation @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the relevant components of the stress and strain tensors , respectively .",
    "@xmath3 denotes the displacement along the fiber and @xmath4 is the internal stress relaxation function .",
    "in addition to the viscoelastic stress , the fiber is subject to myosin contractile stress @xmath5 , which we characterize by a linear stress - strain rate relation @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the strain rate of an unloaded fiber and @xmath8 is the maximal stress that the molecular motors generate under stalling conditions .",
    "in addition to the fiber internal stresses , viscoelastic interactions with the surrounding lead to body forces , @xmath9 , that act over a characteristic length @xmath10 along the fiber and resist the fiber movement : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the external stress relaxation function . in the following",
    "we assume that both internal and external stress relaxation functions have the characteristics of a kelvin - voigt material : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are elastic and viscous parameters , respectively , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the heaviside step and dirac delta function , respectively .",
    "the chosen kelvin - voigt model is the simplest model for a viscoelastic solid that can carry load at constant deformation over a long time .",
