    "a number of theoretical scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of cemp stars , invoking mass transfer in pop iii binary systems @xcite , formation from material enriched in stellar winds of rotating massive and intermediate mass pop iii stars @xcite , or in the ejecta of pop iii sne in which mixing was minimal and fallback was large . in the latter model ,",
    "the small iron abundance thus reflects the fact that in these so - called `` faint '' sne iron was made , but failed to be mixed sufficiently far out to be ejected @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the large c / fe could result from multiple generations of sne , where the ejecta of a `` normal '' sn is combined with that from a low - energy sn in which only the outer layers are ejected @xcite , or from a jet - induced sn explosion @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the origin of cemp stars is complicated by the fact that these do not form a homogeneous group and show various heavy - element abundance patterns : depending on the level of enrichment of neutron capture elements formed by the `` s '' or `` r '' processes , these fall in different sub - classes ( cemp - no , cemp - rs , cemp - s,@xcite ) .",
    "generally , cemp - s and cemp - rs stars have abundance patterns that suggest mass transfer from companion agb stars @xcite ; indeed , most of the stars falling in these sub - classes are members of binary systems @xcite . however , at @xmath0 < -3 $ ] , 90% of cemp are cemp - no stars , which do not show large enhancements of heavy neutron capture elements @xcite . using a homogeneous chemical analysis of 190 metal - poor stars @xcite .",

    "they conclude that the observed chemical abundances are best explained by models which invoke the nucleosynthesis of pop iii sne with mixing and fallback , of rotating massive and intermediate mass stars and of sne with relativistic jets .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn by keller et al .",

    "a general conclusion of the above analyses is that below [ fe / h ] @xmath7 there appear to be two populations of stars , carbon - normal and carbon - rich , whose observed elemental abundances reflect the nucleosynthetic products of `` normal '' and `` faint '' pop iii sne , respectively . the different composition in the material out",

    "we refer the interested reader to limongi & chieffi ( 2012 ) for a thorough presentation of the models .",
    "similarly to what has been done in schneider et al .",
    "( 2012b ) , we consider a set of models that extends in mass between 13 and 80 @xmath19 , which appear to be consistent with the mass range found by the most recent simulations of first star formation ( hirano et al .",
    "these models have been followed from the pre - main sequence phase up to the onset of the iron core collapse by means of the franec stellar evolutionary code .",
    "the initial composition is set to the pristine big bang nucleosynthesis ( y=0.23 ) and mass loss is switched off during all the evolutionary stages .",
    "the explosive nucleosynthesis has been computed in the framework of the induced explosion @xcite approximation . for each progenitor model",
    ", we identify a combination of mixing and fallback that provides the best - fit to the observed elemental abundance ratios ( or upper limits ) on the surface of smss j031300 .",
    "the observational data points are shown in fig.[fig : fit1d3d ] : black points with arrows show the inferred 1d/3d model atmosphere upper limits and the filled black dots with errorbars are the 1d/3d model atmosphere detections ( see keller et al",
    ". 2014 for a description of the model atmosphere used for the abundance analysis ) . among the three elements that have been detected - c , mg , and ca - we show the elemental abundances relative to ca .    the low upper limit on [ n / ca ] disfavour sn progenitors with initial masses in the range @xmath20 \\ , m_{\\odot}$",
    "in fact , their evolution leads to comparable c and n abundances in the ejecta ( see fig.7 and the discussion in limongi & chieffi 2012 ) , in contrast to the observed pattern in smss j031300 .",
    "hence , we include in the analysis sn progenitors with initial masses equal to @xmath21 .",
    "for each of these models , we have applied the optimal combination of mixing ( set by a minimum and maximum mass coordinates within which the mass of each element is uniformly mixed in the ejecta ) and fallback ( set by the mass - cut ) that minimizes the scatter with the observed abundance pattern . since the elemental abundances inferred from the analysis using 1d or 3d model atmospheres lead to sensible differences in the observed abundances ( or upper limits ) of elements that are critical for the resulting dust mass , such as c , o , and mg , for each progenitor mass we have independently inferred best - fit models using 1d and 3d observed elemental abundances .",
    "the resulting models are shown by the starred points joined with dotted lines in fig.[fig : fit1d3d ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure that while all the models show an overall agreement with the observed abudance pattern , it is hard to simultaneously accomodate the upper limit on [ o / ca ] and the detected [ mg / ca ] ; this is particularly true for low mass progenitors , whose evolution leads to a lower [ mg / o ] in the ejecta .",
    "the best - fit model appears to be the most massive progenitor with @xmath22 : adopting the abundance pattern inferred from 1d atmosphere models , the predicted ejecta composition is compatible with all the data points .",
    "this is not true , however , when the 3d data points are considered ( see the right panel in fig.[fig : fit1d3d ] ) as the more stringent upper limit on [ o / ca ] and the larger [ mg / ca ] can not be reproduced . note that in keller et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the model that provides the optimal match to the observed abundance pattern is a @xmath23 explosion of a @xmath24 star of primordial composition with a small amount of ejecta mixing and a strong fallback . these properties closely resemble our best - fit model and indeed the predicted [ mg / h ] falls below the observational data point ( see fig . 3 in keller et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "table [ tab : masses ] summarizes the main properties of the sn progenitors . for all models ,",
    "we choose the interval of mixing and mass - cut to reproduce the observed [ c / ca ] and maximize the [ mg / ca ] , getting as close as possible to the observed value without exceeding the [ o / ca ] and [ fe / ca ] upper limits .",
    "we find that for all but the most massive model , the ejecta composition is insensitive to the reference set of observed abundances , whether derived with 1d or 3d model atmosphere ( the values quoted in the table refer to the 3d set ) .",
    "conversely , the chemical structure of the @xmath22 progenitor , characterized by a more extended mg shell , leads to [ o / ca ] and [ c / ca ] abundance ratios that are more sensitive to the mixing and fallback prescription adopted . as a result , in table [ tab : masses ]",
    "we show the ejecta composition for both sets of observed abundances and refer to the models as @xmath25 - 1d or @xmath25 - 3d .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we test the hypothesis that smss j031300 has formed out of the collapse and fragmentation of a gas cloud that has been pre - enriched by the ejecta of one of the pop iii faint sn studied in the previous section .",
    "we first discuss the expansion of the ejecta into the surrouding ism and then the subsequent recollapse of the star forming cloud , to assess the relative role of fine - structure - line and dust cooling for the formation of smss j031300 .",
    "+      the mixing and fallback model - as first introduced by umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) - naturally predicts a stratified ejecta : the inner material is assumed to be mixed by the growth of rayleigh - taylor instabilities during shock propagation , while the ejecta is dominated by the external material plus a small fraction of the mixed gas near the mass - cut .",
    "the mixing efficiency is still a matter of debate due to the complexity of the mixing / fallback scenario , which depends on the explosion energy , the gravitational potential , and the asphericity during the collapse .",
    "this is the reason why we have studied dust formation in both perfectly mixed and stratified ejecta . yet , when we compare the observed surface elemental abundance of a stellar fossil , such as smss j031300 , with the yields of a single pop iii sn , we make the implicit assumption that the ejecta material has uniformly enriched the parent star forming cloud .",
    "hence , whatever is the degree of mixing at nucleation , 45 - 80 days after the explosion , or after the passage of the reverse shock , @xmath26 years later , the ejecta material needs to be perfectly mixed into the star forming cloud before its subsequent collapse .",
    "an estimate of the maximum timescale available to fully mix the enriched material can be obtained by computing the total mass and radius of the cloud , m@xmath27 , in which the ejecta needs to be diluted in order to match the observed metallicity on the surface of smss j031300 , @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and we have assumed an ism with primordial composition . we find that m@xmath27 is an increasing function of the progenitor mass , since more massive progenitors have larger metal yields , and ranges between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this gas mass is roughly consistent with the baryonic content of a @xmath33 mini - halo .",
    "the radius of the cloud depends on the density of the ism ( @xmath34 ) : to be consistent with the reverse shock models described in the previous section , we assume values in the range @xmath35 \\,gr\\ , cm^{-3}$ ] , where the lower limit approximately corresponds to the critical density at @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding cloud radius is , @xmath37^{1/3}\\ ] ] and varies in the range @xmath38 , which is reached by the sn shock in its sedov - taylor phase on a timescale , @xmath39  myr .",
    "following madau , ferrara & rees ( 2001 ) , we can estimate the growth timescale of rayleigh - taylor instabilities as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath42 is the spatial scale to be mixed . using the values computed above for the cloud mass and radius",
    ", we find @xmath43  myr , depending on the ism density .",
    "hence , in less than a few myr after the explosion of a faint pop iii sn , the ejecta material may have already mixed and enriched the gas out of which second generation stars form .",
    "the resulting stellar mass depends on the cooling and fragmentation properties of the collapsing gas , which we investigate in the following section .",
    "+      we perform a one - zone semi - analytic collapse calculation to follow the temperature evolution of the cloud @xcite , setting the abundances of heavy elements and dust species as inferred from the sn dust models described in the previous section .",
    "we refer the interested reader to chiaki et al .",

    "gas cooling by heat transfer between gas and dust is calculated as the sum over all dust species and size bins .",
    "in addition to the dust mass that is present in the gas cloud at the onset of collapse , we also treat accretion of gas - phase metal species onto dust grains during the collapse ( grain growth , nozawa et al .",
    "2012 ; chiaki et al .",
    "for the purpose of the present analysis , we set the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature at @xmath49 , corresponding to @xmath50 ( see schneider & omukai 2010 for the effects of the cmb temperature floor on the collapse of clouds at different metallicities ) .",
    "[ fig : nt ] shows the cloud evolution in the temperature - density plane .",
    "each panel represents the results assuming that the cloud has been pre - enriched by the explosion of an individual pop iii faint sn model .",
    "we have selected the results of three different progenitor masses ( the 13 and 15 @xmath51 models lead to very similar results ) adopting dust yields formed in uniformly mixed ejecta ( 3d models , although the results are not affected by the set of reference abundances adopted in the explosion calibration ) .",
    "for each of these , we consider the decreasing dust - to - metal ratios that emerge from the passage of the reverse shock of increasing intensity .",
    "the initial dust - to - gas mass ratio at the onset of collapse , @xmath52 and initial transition discriminant @xmath53 are shown in table [ tab : crit ] , where we have written in bold face only the values that are below the corresponding critical limits .",
    "hence , we would expect metal - line cooling to be effective for all but models 13 and 15 @xmath51 in the no reverse shock case , and dust cooling to be effective for all but models @xmath54 in the two stronger reverse shock cases ( rev2 and rev3 ) .",
    "we can compare these simple expectations with full collapse calculations .",
    "the circles and triangles in the figure mark the states where fragmentation conditions are met @xcite . at densities @xmath55 ,",
    "fragmentation is due to line - cooling . in the 13 and 15@xmath51 models , the dominant coolants are hd and ci . for models with moderate reverse shock destruction ( norev , rev1 ) , @xmath56 and - as a result - h@xmath18 formation on grain surface",
    "is very efficient , enabling the formation of hd molecules . on the other hand , ci cooling efficiency is comparable to ( 3d cases ) or exceeds ( 1d cases , where [ c / h ] is larger than 3d ) hd cooling for rev2 and rev3 models .",
    "for the larger progenitor mass models ( 50 and @xmath57 ) , the dominant coolant at intermediate densities is ci as a result of the lower initial condensation efficiencies . yet , as shown by the diagonal lines in the three panels , the characteristic masses of the fragments formed in this early stage of collapse ( the jeans mass at the density where instability occurs ) are estimated to be @xmath58 .",
    "it is important to note that although sputtering of ac grains release c atoms in the gas phase that may be potentially accreted onto the surviving grains at a later stage of the collapse , grain growth has a non - negligible impact on the results only if @xmath59 at the onset of collapse .",
    "in fact , ac grain growth is prevented by efficient formation of co molecules at @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by comparing the carbon condensation efficiencies at the onset of collapse , @xmath61 , and a later stage of the collapse , @xmath62 , when the density is large enough for grain growth to occur efficiently ( @xmath63 , see below ) .",
    "the values predicted by each model are shown in table [ tab : crit ] ; as expected , grain growth has non negligible effect only for the 13 and 15 @xmath19 models with reverse shock .",
    "hence , for all but the smallest progenitor mass models , the conditions for dust cooling and fragmentation are largely determined by the dust - to - gas ratio initially present in the cloud as a result of the sn explosion and the associated reverse shock .",
    "[ fig : nt ] shows that dust cooling is efficient at high densities @xmath64@xmath65 triggering fragmentation and potentially leading to the formation of a low - mass star as smss j031300 .",
    "the only two unsuccessful cases are associated to the @xmath66 faint sn explosion with the stronger reverse shock models .",
    "not surprisingly , in these two models the amount of dust that survives the passage of the reverse shock is not enough to keep the initial dust - to - gas mass ratio above the critical one , @xmath15 \\times 10^{-9}$ ] ( see table [ tab : crit ] ) .",
    "+ finally , it can be shown that the full collapse calculations confirm that even in unmixed models , which are characterized by smaller dust yields , dust - driven fragmentation conditions are met for all reverse shock cases considered , consistent with the fact that the initial dust - gas ratios are super - critical , varying in the range @xmath67 .    following chiaki et al .",

    "the critical conditions are satisfied by all the models but the @xmath66 rev2 and rev3 .",
    "this is consistent with the full collapse calculations .",
    "hence we conclude that the formation of the cemp star smss j031300 , even with the lowest iron - content currently observed , may have been triggered by dust cooling and fragmentation .",
    "the results presented in the previous section have been obtained using the dust and metal yields predicted for faint pop iii sn explosions tailored to reproduce the observed elemental abundances of smss j031300 .",
    "for the first time , we have studied the process of dust formation in carbon - rich , iron - poor ejecta that characterize these explosions .",
    "we find that carbon can be significantly depleted onto ac grains , with condensation efficiencies which can be as large as 75% .",
    "due to the small abundance of other refractory elements in the ejecta , silicates , alumina or magnetite grains do not form in the ejecta of faint pop iii sn . for most of the models that we have explored , when normalized to the observed [ c / h ] which characterize cemp stars , the predicted dust - to - gas ratios in the parent star - forming cloud are large enough to trigger dust cooling and fragmentation , even without the contribution of grain growth .",
    "if these results can be considered as representative for the general class of cemp - no stars , which represent 90% of cemp with @xmath75 < -3 $ ] , then our study suggests that dust cooling and fragmentation may have been responsible for the formation of these low - mass stars .    in a recent work ,",
    "ji et al . (",
    "2014 ) have suggested that the early formation of low - mass stars may follow two alternative pathways : in the dynamic pathway , many sub - clumps are formed through fine - structure line cooling .",
    "dynamical interactions can lead to the ejection of a protostar from the parent cloud , so that a low - mass star can form even in the absence of dust cooling . in the thermal pathway ,",
    "fragmentation due to fine - structure cooling is inhibited by the small abundance of gas - phase elements , and the entire cloud collapses .",
    "a high - density protostellar disk is formed at the center of the cloud , which then fragments and forms low - mass stars due to dust cooling .",
    "observational evidence for these two alternative pathways comes from the distribution of a sample of metal - poor halo stars and dwarf galaxy stars with @xmath0 < -3.5 $ ] in a plane where on the y - axis is the transition discriminant for line - cooling , @xmath76 and on the x - axis is the [ si / h ] ( see their fig .",
    "6 ) ; the latter quantity is used as an indication of the dust - to - gas ratio in the parent cloud , assuming that the dust is mostly made of silicates . when compared with the critical values for fine - structure - line and dust cooling",
    ", they find that stars that have a [ si / h ] too low to form through silicon - based dust cooling are characterized by a large transition discriminant , and satisfy the criterium for fine - structure line cooling and viceversa .",
    "our study questions this interpretation as it shows that cemp stars form in c - rich gas , where silicates do not form and carbon dust is the dominant dust species .",
    "hence , for cemp stars , [ c / h ] is a better proxy for dust cooling than [ si / h ] .",
    "in addition , we also show that fine - structure - line and dust - cooling are not mutually exclusive : the collapsing gas cloud undergoes two distinct phases of fragmentation , one driven by line cooling ( either by metal lines , such as ci , cii or by molecular transitions of h@xmath18 and hd ) at @xmath60 which leads to the formation of @xmath77 sub - clumps ; and the other , driven by dust cooling at @xmath64@xmath65 , which triggers the formation of low - mass stars ( see also tanaka & omukai 2014 ) .",
    "thus , the thermal pathway may be responsible for the formation of both c - rich and c - normal stars , even at lowest [ fe / h ] currently observed , although the dynamic pathway may operate as well .",
    "unfortunately , it is not straightforward to estimate the dust - to - gas ratio of the parent gas cloud from the observed elemental abundances , similar to what is done for the transition discriminant .",
    "in fact , the dust properties ( its composition and size distribution ) depend on the nature of the sn explosions that have dominated the early enrichment and on the level of destruction suffered by the newly formed dust by the passage of the reverse shock , although the latter process may be mitigated by grain growth during the collapse . using the results that we have obtained in the present study as a proxy for the general class of c - rich metal - poor stars and the results obtained by schneider et al .",
    "( 2012b ) and chiaki et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for the stars sdss j1029151 as a proxy for the general class of c - normal metal - poor stars , we can draw the following guidelines : for c - rich stars , carbon condensation efficiencies into dust of @xmath78 translate into critical carbon abundances of @xmath79_{cr } < -3.01 $ ] ; for c - normal stars , the dominant dust compounds are forsterite ( mg@xmath18sio@xmath80 ) and enstatite ( mgsio@xmath47 ) , with mg and si condensation efficiencies which range between @xmath81 and associated critical abundances of @xmath82_{cr } < -4.73 $ ] and @xmath83_{cr } < -4.73 $ ] ( see table 1 in @xcite ) .    in figs .  6 and 7 , we compare these predictions with observational data taken from the sample of c - normal and c - rich stars with @xmath0 < -3 $ ] investigated by norris et al .",

    "<S> we investigate the origin of carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars starting from the recently discovered @xmath0<-7.1 $ ] star smss j031300 ( keller et al . 2014 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the elemental abundances observed on the surface of smss j031300 can be well fit by the yields of faint , metal free , supernovae . using properly calibrated faint supernova explosion models , we study , for the first time , the formation of dust grains in such carbon - rich , iron - poor supernova ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are performed assuming both unmixed and uniformly mixed ejecta and taking into account the partial destruction by the supernova reverse shock . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , due to the paucity of refractory elements beside carbon , amorphous carbon is the only grain species to form , with carbon condensation efficiencies that range between ( 0.15 - 0.84 ) , resulting in dust yields in the range ( 0.025 - 2.25)m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the collapse and fragmentation of a star forming cloud enriched by the products of these faint supernova explosions and we explore the role played by fine structure line cooling and dust cooling . </S>",
    "<S> we show that even if grain growth during the collapse has a minor effect of the dust - to - gas ratio , due to c depletion into co molecules at an early stage of the collapse , the formation of cemp low - mass stars , such as smss j031300 , could be triggered by dust cooling and fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between model predictions and observations of a sample of c - normal and c - rich metal - poor stars supports the idea that a single common pathway may be responsible for the formation of the first low - mass stars . </S>"
