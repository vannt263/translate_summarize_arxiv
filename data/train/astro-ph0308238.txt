    "it is becoming increasingly clear that low - redshift accretion may be the dominant phase of supermassive black hole ( smbh ) growth ( barger et al .  2001 ;",
    "cowie et al .  2003 ) .",
    "although theoretical models of smbh formation have relied on comparisons with the optical quasar luminosity function , optically accessible broad - line active galactic nuclei ( agns ) form only about 30% ( barger et al .",
    "2003b ) of the x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "explanations for the lack of broad lines in most agn optical spectra include absorption along the line - of - sight or dilution of the emission - line signatures by stellar light ( moran , filippenko , & chornock 2002 ) .",
    "regardless of the reason , optically and soft x - ray selected samples substantially undercount the agn population relative to hard x - ray selected samples , at least at intermediate luminosities ( cowie et al .",

    "we also only consider those sources that have been targeted spectroscopically .",
    "the only source property we considered when making our masks for spectroscopy was x - ray flux ( sources with higher x - ray fluxes had higher priority when we had to choose one x - ray source over another due to mask conflicts ) .",
    "we spectroscopically observed 150 sources out of our total @xmath0  kev sample of 228 .",

    "a practical optical limit for obtaining redshifts for x - ray sources using the deep extragalactic imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; faber et al .",
    "2002 ) on keck  ii is about @xmath23 ( see barger et al .",

    "in our analysis we place every x - ray source that was not spectroscopically identified for any reason into each and every redshift interval in order to obtain a strict upper bound on the number of agns that could lie in that redshift interval , modulo the existence of a substantial population of compton - thick sources not detected by _ chandra_. we note in passing that barger et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found from the 1  ms cdf - n data that a substantial population of compton - thick sources is not needed to explain the greater than @xmath25  kev xrb , provided that the _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ xrb measurements , instead of the lower _ heao-1 _ a2 measurement , are assumed at energies less than @xmath25  kev .",
    "for the lh - nw field , we only ever consider the sources that were spectroscopically observed ( identified or not ) .",
    "this is acceptable because the spectroscopy are purely from targeted observations of the x - ray samples . for the other fields , the spectroscopy are not purely from targeted observations of the x - ray samples",
    ", so we need to include all of the sources .",
    "we determined the solid angle covered by the combined samples at a given flux by comparing the observed numbers of sources versus flux with the averaged number counts in the @xmath0  kev band from cowie et al .",
    "this method allows a simple treatment of the incompleteness that was modeled in computing the counts .",

    "we consider this to be a reasonable estimate of the systematic errors in the present analysis .",

    "any source more luminous than @xmath27  ergs  s@xmath3 is very likely to be an agn on energetic grounds ( zezas , georgantopoulos , & ward 1998 ; moran et al .",
    "1999 ) , though many of the intermediate luminosity sources do not show obvious agn signatures in their optical spectra .",
    "cowie et al .  ( 2003 ) used _ chandra _ , _ asca _ , and _ rosat _ data to determine rest - frame @xmath0  kev agn luminosity functions in two redshift intervals , @xmath1 and @xmath28 .",
    "they did not have very many sources in their sample with @xmath0  kev fluxes @xmath29 to @xmath30  ergs  @xmath13  s@xmath3 since that intermediate flux range is not well covered by either small - area , deep _",

    "however , the number density of @xmath10  ergs  s@xmath3 sources is largest in the @xmath6 interval and smaller at both higher and lower redshifts ( see also fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "prior to _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , various groups ( e.g. , comastri et al .  1995 ; gilli , salvati , & hasinger 2001 ) using xrb population synthesis models",
    "based on unified agn schemes predicted that a mixture of unobscured type i agns and intrinsically obscured type ii agns were needed to produce the bulk of the xrb .",

    "only a handful of type ii quasars ( here we define quasars as having @xmath9  ergs  s@xmath3 ) have been detected , and these contribute only a small fraction of the xrb ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "2003b ) .    in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we plot for the redshift intervals @xmath1 and @xmath7 the fractional number of x - ray sources in each luminosity bin , by optical spectral type , versus rest - frame @xmath0  kev luminosity . from figure  [ fig3]a",
    "we see that the dominant population at quasar luminosities , where our redshift identifications are very complete , is broad - line agns",
    ". however , at more seyfert - like luminosities ( @xmath47  ergs  s@xmath3 ) , the broad - line agn fraction declines rapidly with decreasing luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig3]b shows a similar trend with luminosity .",
    "these results suggest a luminosity dependence in optical spectral type : type i agns dominate at quasar luminosities , while type ii agns can only become an important component of the x - ray population at seyfert - like luminosities .",
    "to quantify this , we note that in the @xmath1 redshift interval there are 20 sources with quasar luminosities , of which 15 are broad - line agns .",
    "only three of the unidentified sources would have quasar luminosities if placed in this redshift interval , so the systematic errors are small , and the bulk of the quasars are broad - line agns . in the @xmath7 interval",
    "there are 65 sources with quasar luminosities , of which 58 are broad - line agns .",
    "there are 56 unidentified sources that would have quasar luminosities if placed in this redshift interval , so the systematic uncertainties are larger . however , at least half ( and probably considerably more ) of the sources with quasar luminosities in this redshift interval are broad - line agns .",
    "barger et al .  ( 2003a ) graphically showed how the @xmath10  ergs  s@xmath3 ( seyfert - like luminosities ) number density slowly increases with decreasing redshift from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , while the @xmath50  ergs  s@xmath3 ( quasar luminosities ) number density peaks at @xmath7 .",
    "they also showed that the evolution of the @xmath50  ergs  s@xmath3 number density closely matches in shape the evolution of optically selected quasars .",
    "given these trends and our interesting result from figure  [ fig3 ] that while the dominant population at quasar luminosities is broad - line agns , at lower luminosities the broad - line fraction drops dramatically , here we explore a different aspect of the number density evolution .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we show number density versus redshift for the sources with @xmath51  ergs  s@xmath3 . rather than dividing the sources into luminosity classes , as was done in barger et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , we have instead divided the sources into broad - line ( _ open squares _ ) and non - broad - line ( _ solid circles _ ) agns .",
    "the horizontal bars show the maximal number densities for the non - broad - line agns , obtained by assigning all of the unidentified sources redshifts at the volume - weighted centers of each and every redshift bin and then retaining only those with @xmath51  ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "the bars are not consistent with one another because all of the unidentified sources are included in each and every redshift bin , as long as their luminosities at those redshifts exceed @xmath52  ergs  s@xmath3 .    from figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we see that the number density of non - broad - line agns with @xmath51  ergs  s@xmath3 rises with decreasing redshift , until the last redshift bin .",
    "strikingly , however , the number density of broad - line agns remains roughly constant with redshift while their average luminosities ( _ dashed line ; right - hand axis _ ) decline at the lower redshifts .",
    "this is another example of cosmic downsizing . in the terminology of previous quasar studies ,",
    "the broad - line agns are undergoing pure luminosity evolution , not density evolution .",
    "pure luminosity evolution is consistent with the most recent optical determinations ( boyle et al .",
    "the increase in the number density of non - broad - line sources and the decrease in the broad - line agn average luminosities results in non - broad - line sources increasingly dominating the light at lower redshifts , modulo the existence of a substantial population of compton - thick sources .",
