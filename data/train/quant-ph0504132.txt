    "in a previous publication @xcite , we presented a general solution of the exact master equation for an oscillator coupled to a linear passive heat bath .",
    "this was achieved by solving the generalized quantum langevin equation for the initial value problem @xcite which enabled us to obtain explicit expressions for the time - dependent coefficients occuring in the exact master equation .",
    "mext , we illustrated the general solution with the construction of explicit expressions for the probability distributions for two examples : wave packet spreading and `` schrdinger cat '' state for a free particle .",
    "this enabled us to discover that the low temperature solution gave rise to divergences .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that problems also exist in the high temperature regime .",
    "thus , we are motivated to extend our previous analysis to obtain explicit expressions for the wigner function and the elements of the density matrix , and with the aid of these results to critically examine the equation and its solution .    at the outset",
    "we must point out that the exact master equation has drawbacks that seriously limit its utility .",
    "for the most part these are related to the fact that the initial state is necessarily one in which the particle and heat bath are uncoupled , while the subsequent motion is described by the fully coupled system .",
    "the most serious of these is that the equation ( and therefore its solution ) has an irreparable divergence , irreparable in the sense that it persists in a cut - off model with finite bath relaxation time @xcite .",
    "we believe this divergence is related to a well known phenomenon of quantum field theory : the hilbert space spanned by the eigenfunctions of the coupled hamiltonian is orthogonal to that of the uncoupled hamiltonian @xcite . it can be shown that this is the case for the system of coupled oscillators that is the microscopic basis for the derivation of the exact master equation and its solution @xcite .",
    "the exception is the high temperature limit , where the divergence does not appear since , by convention , one there neglects the zero - point oscillations of the bath .",
    "we therefore confine our discussion to that limit . however , even in that case there are further difficulties .",
    "the first of these is that the initial state breaks the translational invariance of the system .",
    "this is manifest in an initial squeeze centered at the origin that , for a free particle , results in a drift of the mean position toward the origin . for this reason in the examples we consider only the case of a free particle , where this difficulty is most apparent .",
    "a second difficulty with the equation in the high temperature limit is that for short times the diagonal elements of the density matrix , which have the physical interpretation of probabilities , are not necessarily positive .",
    "this is a well known difficulty with the weak coupling master equation , solved by a further time average to bring it to the so - called lindblad form that guarantees positivity @xcite .",
    "it was supposed that the exact master equation , with its time - dependent coefficients , would be immune but , as we shall show explicitly , in the high temperature limit this difficulty remains .",
    "the situation , therefore , is that there are concerns that seriously limit the utility of the exact master equation .",
    "the irreparable divergence can only be avoided with the neglect of zero - point oscillations in the high temperature limit , and even there problems remain with the failure of translational invariance and positivity .    despite these problems",
    ", we argue that the solution of the exact master equation can be useful .",
    "in particular , we show that when the initial particle temperature is taken to be equal to that of the bath , we obtain results that for short times are identical with those obtained  from a calculation which considers entanglement at all times @xcite .",
    "finally , an important result is the demonstration that measures of decoherence based on the wigner function are identical with those based on the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "we argue that the wigner function , being everywhere real , is the preferable description .",
    "the exact master equation , in terms of the wigner function @xmath0 for the complete system of oscillator plus heat bath , may be expressed in the form    @xmath1    and we note the presence of four time - dependent coefficients for which we obtained explicit expressions @xcite .",
    "the general solution of the exact master equation is most simply expressed in terms of the wigner characteristic function ( the fourier transform of the wigner function ) .",
    "@xmath2 expressed in terms of this function , the general solution given in eq .",
    "( 4.15 ) of @xcite takes the simple form , @xmath3 in this expression @xmath4 is the fluctuating position operator , defined in eq .",

    "it was shown in @xcite ( sec .",
    "v.a.2 ) that the quadratic expectations @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are logarithmically divergent , which has the effect that the solution ( [ 2.3 ] ) vanishes identically for non - zero positive times . there , too , it was shown that the divergence is irreparable , in the sense that it persists in a model with a high frequency cut - off . as was stated in the introduction",
    ", it appears that this is a reflection of the well established fact that the states of the uncoupled system ( the initial state ) are orthogonal to those of the coupled system ( states for later times ) @xcite .",
    "this fact , surprising from the point of view of the quantum mechanics of finite systems , is a feature only of systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom . in our case",
    "it is the heat bath that must be infinite . in any event ,",
    "the upshot is that , while the derivation of the exact master equation is formally correct , there is no useful result .",
    "the exception is the high temperature limit , where by convention one neglects zero - point oscillations .",
    "we therefore restrict our further discussion to this limit .",
    "indeed , it is this limit ( or better said : approximation ) that has been considered in all previous discussions of the exact master equation .    in considering the result in the high temperature limit ,",
    "we restrict our discussion to the ohmic model of coupling to the heat bath , which is adequate for our purposes .",
    "this model corresponds to newtonian friction , with retarding force proportional to the velocity .",
    "in addition we consider only the case of a free particle , moving in the absence of any external potential . choosing the friction constant to be @xmath12",

    "it still corresponds to a wave packet centered at @xmath18 with mean square width @xmath19 , but the mean square momentum uncertainty is now @xmath39 , greater than the minimum value .",
    "the result of the squeeze is that the distribution ( [ 3.7 ] ) drifts toward the origin .",
    "less obvious perhaps , the same phenomenon appears in a shrinking width of the probability distribution at short times . at longer times",
    "the width expands due to thermal spreading      as we have noted , the minimum uncertainty wave packet ( [ 3.1 ] ) considered above corresponds to a particle at temperature zero .",
    "a perhaps more realistic initial state would be that for a particle initially at temperature @xmath15 , equal to that of the bath .",

    "( [ 3.9 ] ) for the case of initial particle temperature zero .",
    "the only change is an increase in the width of the gaussian distribution due to thermal spreading , the widths being given by the expressions ( [ 3.10 ] ) with @xmath44 in place of @xmath45 .",
    "we again get more insight into this by forming the limit as @xmath35 goes to zero through positive values , @xmath46 here we see that that there is the same initial squeeze as in eq .",

    "the corresponding results for the particle initially at the temperature @xmath15 of the bath are obtained using the prescription ( [ 3.13 ] ) .",

    "thus , we see that there is no time scale for the disappearance of the interference term , it is already negligibly small at @xmath89 .",
    "we might say that this is just the point .",
    "what has occurred is that an incoherent superposition of pure states has wiped out the interference term . in the present case",
    "this is the result of the initial preparation of the state . in the previous case of an initial pure state , this occurs as a result of the `` warming up '' of the particle in a time @xmath81 . in either case",

    "since the coupling to the bath , as measured by the decay rate @xmath96 , does not appear they can also be obtained from a calculation without dissipation using only the familiar formulas of elementary quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "thus we see that , while the exact master equation gives here correct results , it does so only for times so short that coupling to the bath can be neglected .",
    "the density matrix is a hermitian operator , @xmath97 , defined such that for any wave function @xmath98 corresponding to a state of the particle in the hilbert space @xmath99 is the probability that the system is in the state . from the notion of probability , we see immediately the the density matrix must be a positive definite operator .",
    "consider the eigenfunctions @xmath100 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath101 of the density matrix , @xmath102 clearly , the eigenvalue @xmath101 is the probability that the system is in state @xmath100 and is therefore necessarily positive .",
    "we assume the density matrix is normalized , so that @xmath103 this is a sum of positive terms equal to unity .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath104 moreover , the equality holds if and only if there is exactly one eigenstate with probability one , all others having probability zero .",

    "next consider @xmath107 where we have used that fact that @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the condition ( [ 5.3 ] ) takes the form @xmath109 with the equality holding if and only if the density matrix is that of a pure state .",
    "this is the condition ( [ 3.3 ] ) for a pure state .",

    "using the expressions ( [ 2.5 ] ) for the green function and ( [ 3.5 ] ) for @xmath112 , we see that viewed in the @xmath113 plane the absolute value of the density matrix , @xmath114 , consists of a single gaussian peak .",
    "this peak is initially centered at @xmath115 and circularly symmetric with width @xmath116 . in the course of time",
    "the center of the peak drifts to the origin while stretching in the direction @xmath117 .    for short times ,",
    "the density matrix is not necessarily positive . the simplest way to see",

    "the answer , of course , is that we been able to give a non - trivial meaning to the solution only in the high temperature limit , which involves a serious approximation ( neglect of zero - point oscillations ) .",

    "the off - diagonal peaks are multiplied by the same factor @xmath60 that multiplies the interference term in the wigner function ( [ 4.14 ] ) .",
    "the result is that under the condition @xmath137 , while the peaks slowly broaden and drift toward the origin , the off diagonal peaks rapidly shrink in amplitude .",
    "thus , the two descriptions of the disappearance of the interference term , that in terms of the wigner function and that in terms of the density matrix element , are entirely equivalent . in this connection note that the diagonal density matrix element is the probability distribution ( [ 4.10 ] ) .",
    "the description in terms of the wigner function has the advantage of being real , so somewhat simpler .",
    "neither the wigner distribution in phase space nor the density matrix element in @xmath138 space is directly observable , so either description is theoretical .",
    "we have exhibited a number of significant failures of the exact master equation : due to the irreparable divergence the solution strictly does not exist except in the high temperature limit . even in that approximation",
    "the solution breaks translational invariance .",
    "finally , the solution corresponds to a density matrix that can have negative expected values .",
    "but we must remember that the derivation of the equation as well as its solution are formally correct .",
    "rather , the failures can all be traced back to the assumption of an unentangeled initial state .",
    "the picture of a particle suddenly clamped to a bath corresponds to no physically realizable operation .",
    "even when the initial particle temperature is adjusted to that of the bath it receives a violent squeeze toward the origin . from this follows the `` unphysical '' consequences : correctly described by the exact master equation .",
    "unfortunately , the final assessment is that the exact master equation is of  very limited utility .",
    "in fact , in an exact description the particle must be coupled to the bath ( entangled ) at all times .",
    "think of the example of the blackbody radiation field , which is coupled to the particle through its charge that can in no way be switched on or off . in physical applications",
    "the coupling to the radiation field is sufficiently weak that a description in terms of the familiar weak coupling master equation ( of lindblad form ) is appropriate , but the effects of renormalization and zero - point oscillations are nevertheless present at all times ."
