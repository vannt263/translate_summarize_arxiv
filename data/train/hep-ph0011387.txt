    "the observation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly by super - kamiokande @xcite provided us with convincing evidence that neutrinos have non - vanishing masses .",

    "there is no constraint on the cp - violating phase @xmath16 .",
    "the idea of neutrino factories with muon storage rings was proposed @xcite to determine these mixing parameters ( and the sign of @xmath17 in addition ) .",
    "it attracted the interest of many physicists @xcite , and the neutrino factories turned out to be a very promising candidate for the next generation neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we will be able to observe neutrino oscillations even if @xmath18 is as small as 0.01",

    "the possibility to observe cp violation through long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments was discussed in refs . @xcite and many papers followed these works .    by what observation",
    "can we insist that we measure the cp violation ?",
    "cp violation is characterized by the intrinsic imaginary part of a coupling in a lagrangian .",
    "the presence of an imaginary part of a coupling gives different properties to particles and antiparticles , and it is observed to be cp / t - violation effects . hence we need to discuss cp / t violation using a quantity which is sensitive to the imaginary part of a coupling .",
    "we have to be very careful to construct such a quantity since there is an indirect sensitivity to the cp violating phase ( which constitute not an imaginary part of couplings but a real part ) through a unitarity @xcite . as for lepton",
    "cp / t violation in the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments , one of such quantities is the difference of event rate between cp / t conjugate channels .",
    "we must take care of matter effect @xcite for cp conjugate channels since it gives difference to the event rate too .",
    "therefore we must take into consideration ambiguities of the parameters as the matter effect can mimic the genuine cp violation partially .",
    "we will show that the ambiguities of parameters spoil the experimental sensitivity .",
    "we formulate the treatment of the ambiguity of parameters within the statistical method .",
    "it is important to build a statistical quantity that is sensitive to the imaginary part of coupling .",
    "we propose a proper statistics , and show explicitly that the sensitivity to cp violation effect changes by taking the ambiguities into account . to this end",
    "we estimate how large exposure ( proportional to number of muons and detector size ) is required to observe cp - violation effect by the neutrino factory experiment",
    ". the optimal experimental setup ( muon energy @xmath19 and baseline length @xmath20 ) is shown through such considerations assuming three generation of neutrinos which account for the solar neutrino deficit and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider statistical quantities which are proper to search for a genuine cp - violation effect .",

    "we will discuss in section 3 the case where the ambiguities of the parameters are taken into account .",
    "we present the requirement on the number of muons and the mass of a detector to observe genuine cp - violation effect through measurements of cp - conjugate oscillation channels .",
    "it is shown that the introduction of the ambiguities of parameters greatly change the sensitivity to the cp - violation search . in section 4",
    "we investigate cp - violation search using t - conjugate oscillation channels .",
    "ambiguities of parameters are taken into account also in this section .",
    "the sensitivity in this case is far better compared to the case using cp - conjugate channels , showing that this case is ideal ( preferable ) to search for cp - violation effect .",
    "finally a summary and the discussion is given in section 5 .",
    "let us first discuss the physical quantity which characterizes the presence of cp / t violation in the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "such quantities must be sensitive to the imaginary part of the coupling .",
    "we need to be particularly careful when we make use of cp - conjugate channels in the presence of the matter effect .",
    "let us first recall how the imaginary part of the lepton coupling gets into the oscillation probabilities .",
    "we use the oscillation in the vacuum as a simplest example . the oscillation probability from @xmath23 to @xmath24 in the vacuum",
    "is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath20 are the energy of neutrinos and the baseline length , respectively .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath0 leads to @xmath27 which allows us to write @xmath28 the jarlskog parameter @xmath29 defined by eq.([eq : u - unitarity ] ) vanishes when all the @xmath30 s are real , and the second term of eq.([eq : osc - p-2 ] ) also vanishes .",
    "the existence of imaginary part of lepton coupling gives non - vanishing @xmath29 , and thus we need to observe the quantity which is sensitive to @xmath29 ( including its sign ) to search directly for cp - violation effect . note that this statement is independent of the parametrization of @xmath0 such as in eq.([eq : u - parametrization ] ) .",
    "now we consider the quantity which is sensitive to the jarlskog parameter @xmath29 in presence of matter on the baseline .",
    "we put some assumptions for simplicity to discuss this point .",
    "suppose that we have same initial energy spectra for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "also we suppose that the antineutrinos have about twice larger data size so that the expected event numbers for neutrinos and antineutrinos are equal in no - oscillation case . then the oscillation event numbers of neutrinos @xmath31 and that of antineutrinos @xmath32 are expected to be equal in vacuum if cp is conserved .",
    "the two event numbers are in practice different due to cp violation ( if any ) and matter on the baseline .",
    "the difference of the two event numbers , @xmath33 is intuitively sensitive to the genuine cp violation . here",
    "the cp - violating angle @xmath16 is explicitly written .",
