    "multi - flavor nuclei are interesting objects for studying unconventional states of matter in the hadron and nuclear physics . as a first step to extend the quark flavor ,",
    "strangeness nuclei have been studied both in experiments and in theories extensively . as a new direction , charm and bottom are new flavors whose properties in nuclei should be different from that of strangeness nuclei  @xcite .",
    "charm / bottom nuclei , as well as strangeness nuclei , are important for studying ( i ) heavy hadron and nucleon interaction , ( ii ) properties of heavy hadrons in nuclear medium , and ( iii ) impurity effect for nuclear properties .",
    "those are related to the flavor symmetry of the inter - hadron interaction , the partial restoration of the broken chiral symmetry , and so on , as fundamental problems in qcd . in theoretical studies , there have been a variety of researches about heavy baryons , heavy mesons and quarkonia in nuclear systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "recently , few - body calculations have been also performed  @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we focus on the properties of the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) mesons , whose the quark content @xmath7 with a heavy antiquark @xmath8 and a light quark @xmath9 , which can be bound in finite - size atomic nuclei .",
    "the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson in nuclear systems is the simple system , because there is no annihilation channel by @xmath10 in contrast to the case of its anti - particle @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) in nuclear medium .",
    "they were studied in many theoretical works ; the quark - meson coupling model  @xcite , the mean - field approach  @xcite , the flavor su(4 ) symmetry  @xcite , the flavor - spin su(8 ) symmetry  @xcite , the pion - exchange interaction  @xcite , the qcd sum rules  @xcite , the nambu  jona - lasinio model  @xcite . as advanced topics ,",
    "there are studies about the chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , the kondo effect  @xcite , the spin - isospin correlated nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "a few - body calculations of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) were also performed  @xcite .",
    "the interaction between a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson and a nucleon can be provided by the meson exchange interaction . at short distances ,",
    "it is supplied by the exchange of heavy mesons ( e.g. scalar mesons and vector mesons ) and by the direct exchange of quarks  @xcite . at long distances",
    ", there can be the pion meson exchange , because the pion is the lightest meson as the nambu - goldstone bosons generated by the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry which governs the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson dynamics is given by the heavy quark ( spin ) symmetry ( hqs ) for the heavy antiquark component and chiral symmetry for the light quark component  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important properties of the hqs is that the spin degree of freedom of a heavy ( anti)quark is decoupled from the spatial rotation .",
    "then , the heavy quark spin is independent from the light spin @xmath15 , which is carried by light quarks and gluons , as a sum of angular momenta and intrinsic spins . as a consequence ,",
    "there exist two different types of the heavy hadron states ; the hqs singlet ( @xmath16 ) and the hqs doublet ( @xmath17 )  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson is regarded approximately as the hqs doublet whose pairs are given by a @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) meson , because the mass difference is the order of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) being the charm ( bottom ) quark mass .",
    "this is a good approximation because the charm ( bottom ) quark mass is larger than the typical low - energy scale of the hadron dynamics , say a few hundred mev , and they can be regarded as being sufficiently heavy .",
    "one of the interesting results of the hqs is that the mixing of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) meson is realized in nuclear medium via the interaction process @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this mixing leads to an attraction of the heavy - light hadrons in nuclear matter   for isospin mixing .",
    "when spin - isospin correlation exists in nuclear matter , the one - body mixing by @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) can exist  @xcite . ] .    in the current status of theoretical studies , however , there are many open problems about the properties of the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson and the @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) meson in nuclear systems . for example , the value of binding energy of the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson and/or the @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) meson in nuclear matter with infinite volume is not yet convergent .",
    "the values are scattered very much from a few mev to a hundred mev depending on the model used in the analysis .",
    "hence more theoretical efforts are needed to understand the heavy hadrons in nuclear medium .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to investigate the bound and/or resonant states of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson in atomic nuclei with finite nucleon numbers .",
    "as an interaction between a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson and a nucleon , we adopt the pion exchange potential at long distances and the vector meson exchange potential at short distances .",
    "the existence of the pion exchange interaction is an important result of the hqs , because the mixing process @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) plays the important role  @xcite . at first sight",
    ", there seems no @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) vertex by the parity conservation , and hence there should be no pion exchange interaction for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . the pion exchange interaction for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 )",
    "is indeed induced by the two - step process @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this mixing is available , when the mass of a @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) meson is sufficiently close to the mass of a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson as expected from the ( approximate ) mass degeneracy in the heavy quark limit . in this framework",
    ", we eliminate the dynamical degrees of freedom by a @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) meson in a systematic way , and obtain the effective interaction between a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson and a nucleon .",
    "we then apply the obtained the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) potential to the calculation of the energy levels of a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson in finite - size atomic nuclei .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : potential ] , we formulate the meson exchange potential between a heavy meson and a nucleon , perform the projection of the meson exchange potential , and give the meson - nucleus folding potential . in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we show the numerical results of the bound and resonant states .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary .",
    "the heavy meson in a nucleus is regarded as the two - body system of the meson and the nucleus .",
    "the meson - nucleus interaction is described as the folding potential , which can be obtained by the @xmath34 meson - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) interaction and the nucleon number distribution function in the nucleus .",
    "hereafter , we will use the notation @xmath34 to stand for a @xmath3 meson or a @xmath4 meson .",
    "we will use also the notation @xmath35 for a @xmath18 meson or a @xmath19 meson . as for the @xmath5 potential",
    ", we employ the meson exchange potential of the coupled - channel @xmath36 , as discussed in refs .",
    "the most simple @xmath37 system is the @xmath38-wave state with the total spin @xmath39 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we found one bound state for @xmath40 , and no bound state for @xmath41 . therefore , the @xmath42 state would be the most important one in the mesic nuclear system",
    ".    the @xmath42 state has three channels , namely @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where the notation @xmath46 is used to stand for the intrinsic total spin @xmath38 , the angular momentum @xmath47 and the total spin @xmath48 .",
    "this potential is given by the @xmath49 matrix form .",
    "we will project this potential onto the @xmath50 channel , and use the single - channel @xmath5 potential to construct the folding potential .",
    "first of all , we introduce the meson exchange potential between a @xmath51 meson and a nucleon @xmath1 .",
