    "[ [ ams - subject - classification - msc2010 ] ] ams subject classification ( msc2010 )        the study of heavy traffic in queueing systems began in the 1960s , with three pioneering papers by kingman  @xcite .",
    "these papers , and the early work of prohorov  @xcite , borovkov  @xcite and iglehart  @xcite , concerned a single resource . since then there has been significant interest in networks of resources , with major advances by harrison and reiman  @xcite , reiman  @xcite , williams  @xcite and bramson  @xcite . for discussions , further references and overviews of the very extensive literature on heavy traffic for networks ,",
    "williams  @xcite , bramson and dai  @xcite , harrison  @xcite and whitt  @xcite are recommended .",
    "research in this area is motivated in part by the need to understand and control the behaviour of communications , manufacturing and service networks , and thus to improve their design and performance . but researchers are also attracted by the elegance of some of the mathematical constructs : in particular , the multi - dimensional reflecting brownian motions that often arise as limits .    a question that arises in a wide variety of application areas",
    "concerns how flows through a network should be controlled , so that the network responds sensibly to varying conditions .",
    "road traffic was an area of interest to early researchers  @xcite , and more recently the question has been studied in work on modelling the internet . in each of these cases the network studied is part of a larger system : for example , drivers generate demand and select their routes in ways that are responsive to the delays incurred or expected , which depend on the controls implemented in the road network .",
    "it is important to address such interactions between the network and the larger system , and in particular to understand the signals , such as delay , provided to the larger system .",
    "work on internet congestion control generally addresses the issue of fairness , since there exist situations where a given scheme might maximise network throughput , for example , while denying access to some users . in this area",
    "it has been possible to integrate ideas of fairness of a control scheme with overall system optimization : indeed fairness of the control scheme is often the means by which the right information and incentives are provided to the larger system  @xcite .",
    "might some of these ideas transfer to help our understanding of the control of road traffic ? in this paper we present a preliminary exploration of a particular topic : ramp metering .",
    "unlimited access to a motorway network can , in overloaded conditions , cause a loss of capacity .",
    "ramp metering ( signals on slip roads to control access to the motorway ) can help avoid this loss of capacity .",
    "the problem is one of access control , a common issue for communication networks , and in this paper we describe a ramp metering policy , _ proportionally fair metering , inspired by rate control mechanisms developed for the internet . _",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows . in section  [ asq ]",
    "we review early heavy traffic results for a single queue . in section  [ mic ]",
    "we describe a model of internet congestion control , which we use to illustrate the simplifications and insights heavy traffic allows . in section  [ bnm ]",
    "we describe a brownian network model , which both generalizes a model of section  [ asq ] and arises as a heavy traffic limit of the networks considered in section  [ mic ] .",
    "sections  [ mic ] and  [ bnm ] are based on the recent results of  @xcite .",
    "these heavy traffic models help us to understand the behaviour of networks operating under policies for sharing capacity fairly .",
    "in section  [ mcm ] we develop an approach to the design of ramp metering flow rates informed by the earlier sections . for each of three examples ,",
    "we present a brownian network model operating under a proportionally fair metering policy .",
    "our first example is a linear network representing a road into a city centre with several entry points ; we then discuss a tree network , and , in section  [ rc ] , a simple network where drivers have routing choices . within the brownian network models we show that in each case the delay suffered by a driver at an entry point to the network can be expressed as a sum of dual variables , one for each of the resources to be used , and that under their stationary distribution these dual variables are independent exponential random variables . for the final example",
    "we show that the interaction of proportionally fair metering with choices available to arriving traffic has beneficial consequences for the performance of the system .",
    "john kingman s initial insight , that heavy traffic reveals the essential properties of queues , generalises to networks , where heavy traffic allows sufficient simplification to make clear the most important consequences of resource allocation policies .",
    "consider a queue with a single server of unit capacity at which customers arrive as a poisson process of rate @xmath0 .",
    "customers bring amounts of work for the server which are independent and identically distributed with distribution @xmath1 , and are independent of the arrival process .",
    "assume the distribution @xmath1 has mean @xmath2 and finite second moment , and that the load on the queue , @xmath3 , satisfies @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the _ workload _ in the queue at time @xmath6 ; for a server of unit capacity this is the time it would take for the server to empty the queue if no more arrivals were to occur after time @xmath6 .    kingman  @xcite showed that the stationary distribution of @xmath7 is asymptotically exponentially distributed as @xmath8 .",
    "current approaches to heavy traffic generally proceed via a weaker assumption that the cumulative arrival process of work satisfies a functional central limit theorem , and use this to show that as @xmath8 , the appropriately normalized workload process @xmath9 can be approximated by a reflecting brownian motion @xmath10 on @xmath11 . in the interior @xmath12 of @xmath11",
    ", @xmath10 behaves as a brownian motion with drift @xmath13 and variance determined by the variance of the cumulative arrival process of work .",
    "when @xmath10 hits zero , then the server may become idle ; this is where delicacy is needed .",
    "the stationary distribution of the reflecting brownian motion @xmath10 is exponential , corresponding to kingman s early result .",
    "we note an important consequence of the scalings appearing in the definition  ( [ scaling ] ) , the _ snapshot principle . because of the different scalings applied to space and time , the workload is of order @xmath14 while the workload can change significantly only over time intervals of order @xmath15 . hence the time taken to serve",
    "the amount of work in the queue is asymptotically negligible compared to the time taken for the workload to change significantly  @xcite . _",
    "note that the workload @xmath16 does not depend on the queue discipline ( provided the discipline does not allow idling when there is work to be done ) , although the waiting time for an arriving customer certainly does .",
    "kingman  @xcite makes elegant use of the snapshot principle to compare stationary waiting time distributions under a range of queue disciplines .",
    "it will be helpful to develop in detail a simple example .",
    "consider a markov process in continuous time @xmath17 with state space @xmath18 and non - diagonal infinitesimal transition rates @xmath19 let @xmath20 . if @xmath4 then the markov process @xmath17 has stationary distribution @xmath21 ( here , the superscript @xmath22 signals that the random variable is associated with the stationary distribution ) .",
    "the markov process corresponds to an m / m/1 queue , at which customers arrive as a poisson process of rate @xmath0 , and where customers bring an amount of work for the server which is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath23 .",
    "next consider an m / g/1 queue with the processor - sharing discipline ( under the processor - sharing discipline , while there are @xmath24 customers in the queue each receives a proportion @xmath25 of the capacity of the server ) . the process",
    "@xmath17 is no longer markov , but it nonetheless has the same stationary distribution as in ( [ geom ] ) .",
    "moreover in the stationary regime , given @xmath26 , the amounts of work left to be completed on each of the @xmath24 customers in the queue form a collection of @xmath24 independent random variables , each with distribution function @xmath27 a distribution recognisable as that of the forward recurrence time in a stationary renewal process whose inter - event time distribution is @xmath1 .",
    "thus the stationary distribution of @xmath28 is just that of the sum of @xmath29 independent random variables each with distribution @xmath30 , where @xmath29 has the distribution  ( [ geom ] )  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath31 be a random variable with distribution @xmath1 .",
    "then we can deduce that the stationary distribution of @xmath32 has the property that in probability @xmath33 , the mean of the distribution @xmath30 , as @xmath8 .",
    "for fixed @xmath34 , under the stationary distribution for the queue , let @xmath35 be the number of customers in the queue with a remaining work requirement of not more than @xmath34 .",
    "then , @xmath36 in probability as @xmath8 . at the level of stationary distributions , this is an example of a property called state - space collapse : in heavy traffic the stochastic behaviour of the system is essentially given by @xmath28 , with more detailed information about the system ( in this case , the numbers of customers with various remaining work requirements ) not being necessary .",
    "the amount of work arriving at the queue over a period of time , @xmath37 , has a compound poisson distribution , with a straightforwardly calculated mean and variance of @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , where @xmath40 .",
    "an alternative approach  @xcite is to directly model the cumulative arrival process of work as a brownian motion @xmath41 with matching mean and variance parameters : thus @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "let @xmath44 a brownian motion starting from the origin with drift @xmath45 and variance @xmath46 . in this approach",
    "we define the queue s workload @xmath47 at time @xmath6 by the system of equations @xmath48 the interpretation of the model is as follows .",
    "while @xmath49 is positive , it is driven by the brownian fluctuations caused by arrival of work less the work served .",
    "but when @xmath49 hits zero , the resource may not be fully utilized .",
    "the process @xmath50 defined by equation  ( [ q2 ] ) is continuous and non - decreasing , and is the minimal such process that permits @xmath49 , given by equation  ( [ q1 ] ) , to remain non - negative .",
    "we interpret @xmath51 as the cumulative unused capacity up to time @xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath50 can increase only at times when @xmath49 is at zero .",
    "the stationary distribution of @xmath49 is exponential with mean @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "this is the same as the distribution of @xmath53 where @xmath54 has the stationary distribution of the reflecting brownian motion @xmath10 that approximates the scaled process @xmath55 given by ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the mean of the stationary distribution of @xmath49 is the same as the mean of the exact stationary distribution of the workload @xmath28 , calculated from its representation as the geometric sum  ( [ geom ] ) of independent random variables each with distribution @xmath30 and hence mean @xmath56 .",
    "in other words , for the m / g/1 queue , we obtain the same exponential stationary distribution either by ( a ) approximating the workload arrival process directly by a brownian motion without any space or time scaling , or by ( b ) approximating the scaled workload process in ( [ scaling ] ) by a reflecting brownian motion , finding the stationary distribution of the latter , and then formally unwinding the spatial scaling to obtain a distribution in the original spatial units .",
    "furthermore , this exponential distribution has the same mean as the exact stationary distribution for the workload in the m / g/1 queue and provides a rather good approximation , being of the same order of accuracy as the exponential approximation of the geometric distribution with the same mean .",
    "the main point of the above discussion is that , in the context of this example , we observe that for the purposes of computing approximations to the stationary workload , using a direct brownian model for the workload arrival process ( by matching mean and variance parameters ) provides the same results as use of the heavy traffic diffusion approximation coupled with formal unwinding of the spatial scaling , and the approximate stationary distribution that this yields compares remarkably well with exact results .",
    "we shall give another example of this kind of fortuitously good approximation in section [ bnm ] .",
    "chen and yao @xcite have also noted remarkably good results from using such ` strong approximations ' without any scaling .      in this section",
    "we describe a network generalization of processor sharing that has been useful in modelling flows through the internet , and outline a recent heavy traffic approach  @xcite to its analysis .",
    "consider a network with a finite set @xmath57 of _ resources .",
    "@xmath58 be a non - empty subset of @xmath57 , and write @xmath59 to indicate that resource @xmath60 is used by route @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath61 be the set of possible routes .",

    "_    suppose that resource @xmath60 has capacity @xmath69 , and that there are @xmath70 connections using route @xmath58 .",
    "how might the capacities @xmath71 be shared over the routes @xmath61 , given the numbers of connections @xmath72 ? this is a question which has attracted attention in a variety of fields , ranging from game theory , through economics to political philosophy .",
    "here we describe a concept of fairness which is a natural extension of nash s bargaining solution and , as such , satisfies certain natural axioms of fairness  @xcite ; the concept has been used extensively in the modelling of rate control algorithms in the internet @xcite .",

    "the problem  ( [ pf1])([pf4 ] ) is a straightforward convex optimizationproblem , with optimal solution @xmath79 where the variables @xmath80 are lagrange multipliers ( or _ dual variables _ ) for the constraints  ( [ pf2 ] ) .",

    "a more interesting example is obtained when @xmath241 and @xmath68 is the @xmath242 matrix : @xmath243 so that @xmath62 routes each use a single resource in such a way that there is exactly one such route for each resource , and one route uses all @xmath62 resources . in this case , the stationary distribution given by ( [ approxp ] ) accords remarkably well with the exact stationary distribution described by massouli and roberts @xcite ; it is again of the order of accuracy of the exponential approximation of the geometric distribution with the same mean .",
    "( we refer the interested reader to @xcite for the details of this good approximation . )    in this section and in section [ asq ] we have seen intriguing examples of remarkably good approximations that the direct brownian modelling approach can yield .",
    "inspired by this , in the next two sections we explore the use of the direct brownian network model as a representation of workload for a controlled motorway .",
    "rigorous justification for use of this modelling framework in the motorway context has yet to be investigated .",
    "see the last section of the paper for further comments on this issue .",
    "once motorway traffic exceeds a certain threshold level ( measured in terms of density  the number of vehicles per mile ) both vehicle speed and vehicle throughput drop precipitously  @xcite .",
    "the smooth pattern of flow that existed at lower densities breaks down , and the driver experiences stop - go traffic .",
    "maximum vehicle throughput ( measured in terms of the number of vehicles per minute ) occurs at quite high speeds  about 60 miles per hour on californian freeways and on london s orbital motorway , the m25  @xcite  while after flow breakdown the average speed may drop to 2030 miles per hour . particularly problematic",
    "is that flow breakdown may persist long after the conditions that provoked its onset have disappeared .",
    "variable speed limits lessen the number and severity of accidents on congested roads and are in use , for example , on the south - west quadrant of the m25 . but",
    "variable speed limits do not avoid the loss of throughput caused by too high a density of vehicles  @xcite .",
    "ramp metering ( signals on slip roads to control access to the motorway ) can limit the density of vehicles , and thus can avoid the loss of throughput  @xcite .",
    "but a cost of this is queueing delay on the approaches to the motorway .",
    "how should ramp metering flow rates be chosen to control these queues , and to distribute queueing delay fairly over the various users of the motorway ? in this section we introduce a modelling approach to address this question , based on several of the simplifications that we have seen arise in heavy traffic .",

    "we adopt the simpler approach , since we expect that in heavy traffic travel times along the motorway will be small compared with the time taken for @xmath273 to change significantly . ]",
    "how might the rate function @xmath274 be chosen ?",
    "we begin by a discussion of two extreme strategies .",
    "first we consider a strategy that prioritises the upstream entry points .",
    "suppose the metered rate from line @xmath62 , @xmath275 , is chosen so that for each @xmath276 the cumulative outflow from line @xmath62 , @xmath277 , is maximal , subject to the constraint  ( [ eeet ] ) and @xmath278 for all @xmath128 : thus there is equality in the latter constraint whenever @xmath279 is positive .",
    "for each of @xmath280 , @xmath281 ,  , 1 in turn define @xmath282 to be maximal , subject to the constraint  ( [ eeet ] ) and @xmath283 in consequence there is equality in constraint  ( [ eet ] ) at time @xmath6 if @xmath284 , and by induction for each @xmath276 the cumulative flow along link @xmath60 , @xmath285 , is maximal , for @xmath286 , @xmath287 ,  , 1 .",
    "thus this strategy minimizes , for all times @xmath6 , the sum of the line sizes at time @xmath6 , @xmath288 .",
    "the above optimality property is compelling if the arrival patterns of traffic are exogenously determined .",
    "the strategy will , however , concentrate delay upon the flows entering the system at the more downstream entry points .",
    "this seems intuitively unfair , since these flows use fewer of the system s resources , and it may well have perverse and suboptimal consequences if it encourages growth in the load @xmath174 arriving at the upstream entry points .",
    "for example , growth in @xmath289 may cause the natural constraint  ( [ capcon ] ) to be violated , even while traffic arriving at line @xmath62 suffers only a small amount of additional delay .",
    "next we consider a strategy that prioritises the downstream entry points . to present the argument most straightforwardly ,",
    "let us suppose that the cumulative inflow to line @xmath58 is discrete , i.e. , @xmath290 is constant except at an increasing , countable sequence of times @xmath291 , for each @xmath86 .",
    "suppose the inflow from line @xmath292 is chosen to be @xmath293 whenever @xmath244 is positive , and zero otherwise",
    ". then link @xmath292 will be fully utilized by the inflow from line @xmath292 a proportion @xmath294 of the time .",

    "provided the system is stable , link @xmath292 will be utilized solely by the inflow from line @xmath60 a proportion @xmath301 of the time .",
    "hence the system will be unstable if @xmath302 and thus may well be unstable even when the condition  ( [ capcon ] ) is satisfied .",
    "essentially the strategy starves the downstream links , preventing them from working at their full capacity .",
    "our assumption that the cumulative inflow to line @xmath58 is discrete is not essential for this argument : the stability region will be reduced from  ( [ capcon ] ) under fairly general conditions .",
    "the two extreme strategies we have described each have their own interest : the first has a certain optimality property but distributes delay unfairly , while the second can destabilise a network even when all the natural capacity constraints  ( [ capcon ] ) are satisfied .",
    "given the line sizes @xmath303 , we suppose the metered rates @xmath304 are chosen to be proportionally fair : that is , the capacity allocation policy @xmath305 solves the optimization problem  ( [ pf1])([pf4 ] ) .",
    "hence for the linear network we have from relations  ( [ cs1])([cs2 ] ) that @xmath306 where the @xmath307 are lagrange multipliers satisfying @xmath308 under this policy the total flow along section @xmath60 will be its capacity @xmath309 whenever @xmath310",

    "<S> the design of ramp metering strategies has several features in common with the design of access control mechanisms in communication networks .    inspired by models and rate control mechanisms developed for internet congestion control , we propose a brownian network model as an approximate model for a controlled motorway and consider it operating under a proportionally fair ramp metering policy . </S>",
