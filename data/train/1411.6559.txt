    "the coronal mass ejection ( cme ) from 23 july 2012 was one of the most energetic events ever recorded , having a transit time from sun to 1  au of less than 21  h. the event raised a lot of attention due the strong magnetic ejecta and the extremely high impact speed of more than 2200  km  s@xmath0 for the shock ahead of it as measured by in - situ instruments aboard stereo - a / plastic @xcite .",
    "if directed towards earth , the cme might have been of unusual high geoeffectiveness and scenarios of extreme space weather consequences were proposed @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the solar perspective of this event and came to the conclusion that the complex magnetic field and high field strength as measured in - situ is most probably attributable to a cme - cme interaction process .",
    "these authors also speculated that the extremely high speed and short propagation time were caused by the increased upstream solar wind speed and decreased solar wind density as well as magnetic field tension , which in turn resulted from the cme associated with an m7.7 flare on 19 july 2012 .",
    "the structure of the ambient magnetic field and plasma flow in which cmes are embedded in may play a critical role in controlling their propagation behavior and geoeffectiveness ( see _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in recent years the stereoscopic view made possible by the _ solar - terrestrial relations observatory _ ( stereo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has permitted us to learn much about the evolution of cmes in the inner heliosphere .",
    "observational results revealed that variations in the ambient solar wind speed , _ _",
    "e.g.__by slow and fast solar winds and various interactions , may appreciably change the cme kinematics ( including deflection ) and deform the cme structure ( see _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies pointed out that magnetic erosion by reconnection processes at the front of the magnetic structure of the cme may significantly reduce the strength of geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "as such , the preconditioning of interplanetary space has immediate consequences for predicting arrival times and impact speeds of cmes .",
    "since the plasma and magnetic field conditions in interplanetary space are not observationally well - known , research on the interaction of cmes with their environment may be performed by combining the observational data with models . in this study",
    ", we investigate the cme from 23 july 2012 in terms of its evolution in the inner heliosphere .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) kinematical profile of the cme is derived up to a distance range of 30  @xmath2 by applying the graduated cylindrical shell ( gcs ) model @xcite .",
    "assuming that the aerodynamic drag governs the evolution of the cme at farther distances from the sun , we use the drag - based model ( dbm;@xcite , and references therein ) to reconstruct the cme propagation behavior .",
    "this yields results that strongly indicate the low density environment in which the cme is propagating in .",
    "in section  [ obs ] we give an overview of the observational data and describe the methods that are used for the analysis .",
    "we give the results in section  [ res ] and discuss them and draw our conclusions in sections  [ dis ] and  [ con ] .",
    "on 23 july 2012 at around 02:08  ut a fast cme is launched from solar active region noaa  11520 located at w141@xmath6 , _ _ i.e.__behind the limb from earth - view .",
    "two filament eruptions may have driven two cmes , which then interacted ( see * ? ? ? * ) . however , we can not clearly separate two individual cme profiles in the coronagraph data .",
    "therefore , for our study we simply refer to the event as two - stage filament eruption resulting in a complex cme , consistent with the overall cme profile from @xcite . in this respect",
    "we note that the derived longitude range of the cme is consistent with the erupting filament located at the eastern edge of the active region . for the event time",
    ", the two stereo spacecraft , stereo - a ( _ ahead _ ) and stereo - b ( _ behind _ ) , were located , respectively , at the heliographic longitude of w121@xmath6 and e115@xmath6 , and heliocentric distance of 0.96  au ( @xmath3206  @xmath2 ) and 1.02  au ( @xmath3219  @xmath2 ) .",
    "stereo - a views the cme as halo event , stereo - b close to its eastern limb with the plane - of - sky angle w155@xmath6 .",
    "we use the disk - integrated flux from the euvi - a 195  channel as proxy to estimate the soft x - ray emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "according to this , the associated flare is a long duration event of at most x2.5 goes class .",
    "the development of the cme up to a distance range of @xmath330  @xmath2 is observed from combined euv and white - light data from stereo - a and -b as well as the _ solar heliospheric observatory _",
    "( soho ; * ? ? ?",
    "using contemporaneous imaging data from the coronagraphs aboard those spacecraft enables us to do a 3d reconstruction of the cme evolution by applying the gcs model .",
    "the different viewpoints from at least two spacecraft ( combination of cor2-a on stereo - a , cor2-b on stereo - b , and lasco / c2/c3 on soho ) are digested into the model and by forward fitting the model flux rope to the observed white - light structure we obtain the 3d geometry ( width and cross section ) , propagation direction and deprojected kinematics of the cme .",
    "we apply the same model for investigating the shock ahead of the flux rope by putting the half - angle to zero and the ratio aspect close to one .",
    "this makes the front part of the gcs model spherical in order to mimic the geometry of a shock front ( see * ? ? ?",
    "measurements coming from single spacecraft data ( euvi - b , cor1-b ) are deprojected onto the derived 3d results using a multiplication factor . from the deprojected distance - time data we derive the speed- and acceleration time profiles by using the regularization method originally developed by @xcite to invert solar x - ray spectra measured by the _ reuven ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( rhessi ; * ? ? ?",
    "the method was further developed and could be successfully applied to cme kinematical data as described in @xcite .    by calibrating white - light images from cor2-b data in units of the mean solar brightness and subtracting a pre - event image",
    "we calculate the excess brightness due to the cme .",
    "the excess brightness is then converted to the excess mass of the cme under the common assumptions that all of the cme mass is concentrated on the plane - of - sky of the corresponding instrument , and that the cme material consists of 90%  h and 10%  he .",
    "the brightness of all pixels in the region covering the cme is then summed up and fed into the following relation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the white - light pixel brightness and @xmath9 the single electron brightness at the angle @xmath10 from the plane - of - sky ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in - situ data are taken from the stereo - a / impact - mag instrument which measures the magnetic field direction and magnitude @xcite .",
    "the high fluxes of solar energetic particles associated with this event are the cause of a data gap for the solar wind plasma data by plastic @xcite and , hence , are reconstructed from the magnetic field data ( 5  min resolution ) .",

    "we extract the arrival time and the lower limit of the impact speed of the cme shock and magnetic ejecta as given in @xcite .    for investigating the propagation behavior of the cme in interplanetary space , and to relate the results from remote sensing and in - situ data , we use the dbm @xcite .",
    "applying the dbm we assume that the cme propagation speed ( @xmath11 ) at far distances from the sun is governed only by the conditions of the ambient solar wind flow ( density , @xmath12 , and speed , @xmath13 ) which can be expressed in terms of the magnetohydrodynamical analogue of the aerodynamic drag ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "the acceleration due to the aerodynamic drag of the ambient solar wind is given by @xmath14=@xmath15 with @xmath16=@xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the cross - section and the mass of the cme , respectively , @xmath12 the ambient solar wind density and @xmath20 is the dimensionless drag coefficient , typically of order unity ( _ cf . _ * ? ? ?",

    "an online version of the dbm is available under http://oh.geof.unizg.hr/dbm/dbm.php .",
    "due to the close location of the source region of the cme ( w141@xmath6 ) and the plane - of - sky viewing angle of stereo - b ( w155@xmath6 ) , it is reasonable to assume that stereo - b images are only marginally affected by projection effects . from high - cadence euvi - b 171  data ( 1.25  min resolution )",
    "we are able to track the onset of a loop formation at 2:02  ut that further develops into the cor1-b field - of - view ( fov ) revealing at 2:13  ut the first signature of the cme .",
    "the cme can be tracked into the fov of cor2-b and is also identified in stereo - a white - light as well as soho / lasco data enabling us to derive its 3d kinematics .",

    "the density envelope of the cme nicely reveals the shock - sheath and the magnetic structure ( see annotation in the top right panel of figure  [ gcs ] ) . in order to compare the in - situ signatures of the arriving shock and magnetic structure separately ,",

    "the forward fit shown in figures  [ gcs ] and  [ gcs2 ] gives the best match with the white - light data as viewed from different vantage points . from this",

    "measurements of the early evolution phase of the cme from euvi - b 171  and cor1-b images are deprojected by using a multiplication factor of 1.1 to match the 3d values . with this",
    "we derive deprojected distance - time data from @xmath31.25  r@xmath23 up to 30  @xmath2 .",
    "we intentionally used some extreme scaling to track the shock front of the cme , however , we note that a clear separation between shock and magnetic structure is only observed in cor2 and lasco data .",
    "figure  [ distance ] gives the deprojected distance - time values resulting from the gcs model and individual measurements ( quasi - gcs and data from a single spacecraft ) .",
    "due to the uncertainty in the 3d reconstruction , especially for distances far from the sun , we put rather conservative error bars which is reflected in the uncertainties derived for the speed- and acceleration - time profiles .",
    "figure  [ speed ] shows the speed - time profile together with the euv flux in the 195  channel .",
    "the cme shock front reaches around 03:00  ut ( @xmath15  min ) a maximum speed of 2580@xmath1280  km  s@xmath0 and the magnetic structure 2270@xmath1420  km  s@xmath0 .",

    "consistent with case and statistical studies , the hard x - ray as well as the derivative of the soft x - ray flux of the flare is closely related to the acceleration profile of the associated cme @xcite .",
    "this gives strong evidence that the complex cme eruption is launched during the initial rising phase of the euv emission .",
    "the cme mass is calculated from cor2-b data at a distance of about 14  @xmath2 and is found to be in the range of 1.5@xmath10.5@xmath25  g. the cme mass refers to a lower limit since we neglect possible projection effects @xcite . from the cme mass and maximum speed",

    "it follows that the ambient solar wind flow speed in which the fast shock is propagating is of average value with 450  km  s@xmath0 close to the slow solar wind speed .",
    "the initial shock speed is required to be close to the impact speed ( almost no deceleration ) since for higher initial shock speeds , larger than @xmath32300  km  s@xmath0 , the model could not reproduce the observed arrival time and would arrive much too early .",

    "we conclude for the shock , the weak deceleration is owing to the extremely low @xmath16 value , which we will examine in more detail below .",
    "we would like to add , the empirical acceleration - velocity relation by @xcite would give a correct arrival time using as input speed 2500  km  s@xmath0 but would have largely underestimated the impact speed .",

    "we constrain the model input parameters by observations from remote sensing data which give for the magnetic structure a distance of 23  @xmath2 at 04:25  ut and a speed in the range of 7502350  km  s@xmath0 ( _ _ cf.__figures  [ distance ] and  [ speed ] ) .",
    "as the magnetic structure propagates in the wake of the fast shock we use the resulting dbm speed - time profile from the cme shock as input for the ambient solar wind speed .",
    "this further constrains the model input values .",

    "we note that these values are lower than those derived by @xcite with @xmath33050@xmath1200  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite use a triangulation technique of time - elongation maps which are extracted from the ecliptic plane .",
    "our study is based on gcs modeling which reproduces the entire density envelope of the cme along its propagation direction , hence , the results are not restricted to structures propagating along the ecliptic .",
    "we note that deviations from self - similar expansion and the idealized geometry assumption might be the caveat for the gcs results .    from the kinematics we derive the acceleration phase of the cme .",
    "considering for the major acceleration peak of the cme an acceleration duration of @xmath330  min , we estimate from different power - law relations maximum acceleration values in the range of 0.21.0  km  s@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , the derived acceleration value from observations is much higher ( 2.2@xmath10.1  km  s@xmath24 ) , showing the exceptional characteristics of this event . from this",
    "we may speculate that most probably it is the underlying magnetic reconnection process itself that is able to efficiently drive the cme to such high speeds at far distance from the sun .",
    "related to this we note that in general cmes that reach high peak accelerations start at lower coronal heights @xcite and suggest that the low starting height of the cme might contribute to the strong magnetic field as measured in - situ .",
    "assuming that the further cme evolution is solely governed by the drag force owing to the ambient solar wind ( speed and density ) , we use the dbm to simulate the short travel time from sun to stereo - a as well as the high impact speed .",

    "the ambient solar wind speed is found to be of average value close to the slow solar wind speed and might not play the key role for producing the short propagation time .",
    "the extreme low drag exerted on the cme is due to the applied @xmath16 value which has to be one order of magnitude lower than statistically derived for dbm shocks @xcite .",
    "the very high mass of the cme under study is one key requirement for a low @xmath16 value and the low drag ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "but most important , the ambient solar wind density should not exceed 12  @xmath5 in order to derive the @xmath16 value as low as required for our study . with this",
    "we support the interpretation by @xcite who pointed out the importance of the preconditioning of interplanetary space as consequence of the prior cme from july 19 , 2012 .",
    "as shown in @xcite the trailing part of the prior cme has a density as low as 1  @xmath5 .",
    "we further conclude that a largely radial orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field , due to its stretching , may reduce the pile - up of solar wind and delay its replenishment .",
    "this may preserve the preferable conditions for a fast propagation of the cme launched 3.5  days later . in this respect",
    "we note that owing to the low solar activity of cycle 24 , the solar wind density is generally low . for the propagation behavior of the cme magnetic structure",
    "we find that the weak drag exerted on the magnetic structure is due to the high ambient solar wind speed resembling its propagation in the wake of the fast shock .",
    "we identify the following key characteristics in the 23 july 2012 cme :    * high cme launch speed due to high flare energy release of long duration * very high cme mass due to high amount of filament plasma * extremely low ambient solar wind density due to previous cme and weak solar cycle    in conclusion , the extreme character of the 23 july 2012 eruption is first of all marked by the long duration flare energy release . due to an efficient magnetic reconnection process",
    "the cme might reach a very high speed that is sustained by the prolonged energy release .",
    "the underlying mechanism which is able to build up the energy in the source region as well its conversion into such high kinetic energy is beyond the limit of information from observational data .",
    "we encourage modelers to provide further insight into the physics of source regions and reconnection processes related to such extreme events .",
    "the very high mass of the cme , related to the filament eruption , as well as the preconditioning of interplanetary space , in terms of reduced solar wind density , may have been the decisive factors for low deceleration leading to the short transit time and high in - situ impact speed .",
