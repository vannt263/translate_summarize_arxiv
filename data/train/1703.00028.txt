    "the sz cluster surveys have become a robust probe for determining cosmological parameters and global properties of icm @xcite .",
    "however , in order to obtain robust cosmological estimates using such techniques one requires the precise knowledge of the evolution of galaxy clusters with redshift and the thermodynamical properties of icm . in the simplest case , where one considers a pure gravitational collapse , the cluster scaling relations are expected to follow simple self - similarity @xcite .",
    "correlations between the x - ray properties are widely used to probe the self - similarity in the galaxy clusters .",
    "for example , the luminosity - temperature ( @xmath18 ) relation for self - similar models predict a shallower slope ( @xmath19 ) than observed ( @xmath20 ) @xcite implying a break in the self - similarity in galaxy clusters .",
    "similarly , studies of the scaling relations involving sz effect also show discrepancies between observations and predictions from a pure gravitational model @xcite .",

    ", we describe the self - similar non - radiative model for galaxy clusters .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to the determination of excess entropy and energy profiles , and the effects of the non - thermal pressure and gas clumping on their estimates . in section 5",

    "in this work , we have studied a sample of 17 clusters in the redshift range ( @xmath38 ) that are common in @xcite and @xcite . based on their central entropy @xcite ,",
    "six of these clusters are classified as cool - core ( @xmath39 kev @xmath6 ) , while the remaining 11 are non - cool core .",
    "this sample was earlier used by @xcitedeckert / newsite / dominique_eckerts_hom + epage.html . ] where they have shown that the thermodynamic state of the icm can be accurately recovered by using the planck sz pressure profile @xcite and rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) gas density profile @xcite .",
    "since the sz signal is proportional to the integrated pressure ( gas density ) , unlike the x - ray signal , which is proportional to the square of density , it decreases more gently at large radius and therefore can provide more accurate pressure profiles in the cluster outskirts .",
    "this allows us to accurately recover the temperature profile beyond @xmath4 .",
    "we use parametric profiles obtained by them in this work ( see @xcite for more details ) which were obtained by fitting a functional form to the projected emission - measure data @xcite and planck sz pressure data @xcite .",
    "the errors were obtained through monte carlo markov chain , with direct sampling of the posterior temperature , entropy , and gas fraction distributions .",
    "@xcite also obtained deprojected profiles by estimating density profile through `` onion peeling '' technique @xcite and interpolating the sz pressure profile .",
    "correction for edge effects were also applied along with median smoothing regularization for minimizing the roller - coaster effect @xcite .",
    "the error bars were recovered by perturbing the original profile using a monte carlo and recomputing the deprojected profiles each time .",
    "since the parametric profiles are forced to be regular , this reduces the cluster to cluster scatter and the errors . at smaller radii",
    "the angular resolution of both planck and rosat is insufficient to obtain reliable constraints .",
    "therefore , the parametric fitting was only performed on the data beyond @xmath40 and were found to be consistent with the deprojected profiles .",

    "it has been found from both observations and simulations that @xmath51 is underestimated by about @xmath52 , if one uses the hydrostatic equation without non - thermal pressure @xcite . from the recent numerical simulations , we model the non - thermal pressure fraction in the power law form similar to that given in @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total gas pressure , @xmath55 , @xmath56 for low redshift clusters ( @xmath57 ) with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite . in upper panel of fig .",
