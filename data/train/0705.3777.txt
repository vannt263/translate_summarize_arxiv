    "recently , the idea to use quantum spin chains for short - distance quantum communication was put forward by bose @xcite .",
    "he showed that an array of spins ( or spin - like two level systems ) with isotropic heisenberg interaction is suitable for quantum state transfer .",
    "in particular , spin chains can be used as transmission lines for quantum states without the need to have controllable coupling constants between the qubits or complicated gating schemes to achieve high transfer fidelity .",
    "alice prepares an input state on the first spin of the chain at time @xmath0 ( all other spins are in the state down / zero ) , and after a certain time @xmath1 bob recovers an output state on the last spin at the other end , while alice normally looses her state , in fulfillment of the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "bose showed that the average fidelity of the quantum state transfer exceeds the maximum value which can be achieved classically for spin chains of length @xmath2 up to @xmath3 .",
    "the method was later extended using engineered coupling constants @xcite , multi - spin encoding @xcite , as well as `` dual - rail encoding '' in two parallel quantum channels @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the transmission even through very long chains can be improved to almost perfect fidelity if the coupling of the first and last spins to the chain is reduced .",
    "as with any task in quantum information processing which offers an advantage over classical information processing , the question arises what in the quantum world allows for that advantage .",
    "it is generally acknowledged that quantum entanglement and interference are two ingredients which distinguish quantum information processing from its classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement has been studied in great detail over the last fifteen years @xcite , but the precise role of interference in various quantum information treatment tasks remains to be elucidated @xcite .",
    "contrary to entanglement , interference is a property not of a quantum state but of the propagator of a state .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coherence of the propagation is important for interference .",
    "indeed , the final probability distribution resulting from a given quantum algorithm can always be generated through stochastic simulation on a classical computer as well : for a known quantum circuit and initial state one can in principal calculate the final state , and therefore the probability distribution .",
    "it is then simple to create a stochastic process which gives each possible outcome with the correct probability .",
    "in such a classical simulation clearly no interference takes place .",
    "thus , what counts for interference is not a state itself but the way it was created .",
    "a quantitative measure of interference in any quantum mechanical process in a finite - dimensional hilbert space was recently introduced in @xcite , and the statistics of quantum interference in random quantum algorithms was studied in @xcite . here",
    "we propose to study the role of interference in quantum state transfer through spin chains . after defining the notion of interference , reduced interference , and fidelity in section [ section_def_interference ]",
    ", we will follow two complementary approaches : in section [ section_reduced_interference ] we will consider the spin chain as a black box which propagates the initial state of the first and last spins combined to a final state of these two spins .",
    "we will calculate the reduced interference that describes this propagation for different spin chains and show that perfect state transfer is possible without quantum interference . in section [ section_full interference ]",
    "we will then consider the unitary evolution of the entire chain and analyze this unexpected result .",
    "the interference @xmath4 for a general quantum process described by a propagator @xmath5 which propagates an initial state @xmath6 with matrix elements @xmath7 in a fixed orthonormal basis of dimension @xmath8 to a final state @xmath9 , @xmath10 is defined as @xcite @xmath11    if @xmath12 describes the propagation of the reduced density matrix of the first and last spins alone ( which will be mixed in general , as it results from tracing out the intermediate spins of the chain ) , eq .",
    "( [ ip ] ) defines the `` reduced interference '' @xmath13 .",
    "we will evaluate @xmath13 analytically for spin chains which conserve the number of excitations in the chain , and show that @xmath13 is intimately linked to the average fidelity @xmath14 introduced in @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pure state to be transmitted prepared on the first spin , @xmath17 is the output state on the last spin ( i.e.  @xmath18 , with the trace over the first ( input ) spin ) , and the integral is over all initial states of the input spin on the bloch sphere parameterized by the spatial angle @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath14 is a function of time and we are interested in the maximum fidelity in some reasonable time interval , that is less than the decoherence time of the qubits , and scales like the inverse coupling @xcite",
    ". we will also provide numerical results for @xmath13 for chains in which the number of excitations is not conserved .",
    "the interference measure for the unitary propagation of the entire chain , @xmath20 reduces to @xcite @xmath21 for this coherent propagation , the interference @xmath22 measures the degree of equipartition of the output that result from any basis state of a system at @xmath0 .",
    "here , an equipartitioned state means a state that is a superposition of all the basis states with amplitudes of modulus @xmath23 . for better comparison of the results we will plot the normalized interference @xmath24 so that the maximal possible value of the interference is one and does not depend on the number of qubits in the chain .",
    "we start by evaluating the reduced interference in excitation - preserving chains , i.e. , spin chains for which the total hamiltonian @xmath25 commutes with the total spin component @xmath26 .",
    "the particular example of the chain with isotropic heisenberg interaction proposed by bose @xcite falls into this class ( see section [ sec.bosechain ] below ) .",
    "we start with at most one excitation in the chain and limit ourselves to pure initial states",
    ". therefore one can specify a state of the entire chain @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) by the position at which the excitation is localized . in principle",
    "there are four computational basis states for the two spins , but the state where both the first and the last spins are excited will never appear .",
    "we therefore restrict our attention to the three - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the states @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( the state where both the first and the last spins are not excited ) .",
    "we will also make use of the state @xmath32 of the intermediate part of the chain , where all intermediate spins are not excited .",
    "we start from an initial state of the chain which factorizes between the two selected spins ( @xmath33 and @xmath2 ) and the rest of the chain , which is assumed to be in state @xmath32 , @xmath34 the initial reduced density matrix of the first and last spins , @xmath35 then still represents a pure state . for any hamiltonian that conserves the number of excitations",
    "we can write the state at time @xmath36 as    @xmath37    or @xmath38 where @xmath39    after tracing out the intermediate spins we obtain the final density matrix of the first and last spins , @xmath40 where @xmath41    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) , ( [ rho2 ] ) , and ( [ rho ] ) we read off the propagator @xmath42 where the rows and columns are in the order @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "inserting @xmath12 into eq .",
    "( [ ip ] ) , we obtain @xmath52    for the reduced interference . this expression can be further simplified by using @xmath53 such that @xmath54 this result is valid for any hamiltonian of the entire chain that conserves the number of excitations . in the case of a linear chain with symmetrical nearest - neighbor interactions (",
    "i.e. the hamiltonian is invariant under relabeling the qubits @xmath55 into @xmath56 ) , we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the reduced interference can then be expressed using two amplitudes of the state transfer , @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "we are now in the position to evaluate @xmath4 for specific examples .",
    "let us first consider the spin chains studied in @xcite .",
    "they consist of a one - dimensional array of @xmath2 spins , with nearest - neighbor spins coupled through an isotropic heisenberg interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of the chain reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the vector of the pauli matrices on site @xmath63 , @xmath64 denotes the site - dependent static magnetic field and @xmath65 is the coupling strength , taken as constant for all spins .",
    "bose showed that the average fidelity , eq .",
    "( [ ft ] ) , for this model is given by @xmath66 at @xmath0 , @xmath67 for @xmath68 , such that the average fidelity corresponds to the fidelity of a random guess of bob of the quantum state of alice ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the overlap @xmath70 becomes appreciable , once the spin wave excited at alice s end arrives at bob s spin .",
    "perfect state transfer for all states ( @xmath71 ) requires @xmath72 , along with @xmath73 .",
    "the last equality can always be achieved by varying the magnetic fields @xmath64 . from here on we will assume that this is the case and therefore put @xmath74 when plotting fidelities of the state transfer .    by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ ipfin ] ) and ( [ ft2 ] ) one can see that interference is determined by one more complex variable @xmath75 compared to the fidelity .",
    "therefore , in general there is no explicit formula that describes interference in terms of fidelity alone .",
    "naively one might expect that interference should play an important role for quantum state transfer , if the fidelity of the process exceeds the maximal classical value , @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "however , note that an ideal quantum state transfer can be realized through the permutation of the first and the last spins @xmath77 , @xmath78 , which does not lead to any interference at all . in general , interference measures",
    "both the equipartition of all output states for any computational basis state as input , and the coherence of the propagation .",
    "`` coherence '' was defined in @xcite as the sensitivity of the final probabilities @xmath79 to the initial phases . as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) , the only phase information which contributes to the reduced interference in the propagation through the spin chain is the relative phase between the states @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "however , the coherence of the propagation becomes irrelevant for perfect transfer , @xmath72 , as then @xmath80 due to the conservation of the number of excitations , and then the final probabilities do not depend on any initial phases anymore .",
    "i.e.  for ideal state transfer , the dynamics of the chain indeed realizes the above permutation with vanishing interference .",
    "this is also evident from eq .",
    "( [ ipfin ] ) for @xmath81 .",
    "note , however , that the interference is finite during the propagation of the signal through the chain , as well as quite generally for any situation in which neither @xmath75 nor @xmath82 vanish .",
    "all one can say is that for @xmath14 close to 1 , i.e. @xmath82 close to 1 and thus @xmath83 close to 0 , @xmath13 remains quite small .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows @xmath13 that was obtained by numerically propagating @xmath84 for @xmath85 ( see eq .",
    "( [ psit ] ) ) with the hamiltonian ( [ hbose ] ) .",
    "the results are plotted with time in units of @xmath86 .",
    "we also assumed that @xmath87 for all @xmath63 and therefore the interference does not depend on magnetic field .",
    "indeed , in our model @xmath88 influences only the phases of @xmath75 and @xmath82 through a term @xmath89 ( see , for example @xcite ) and according to eq .",
    "( [ ipfin ] ) the interference depends only on phase differences and not on a global phase .",
    "one can see that the interference remains quite small .",
    "this is because the probability to find an excitation inside the chain is high and both quantities @xmath90 and @xmath91 can not be big ( @xmath92 ) at the same time at the time scale that is relevant for quantum state transfer .",

    "we see that both are perfectly anticorrelated .",
    "in particular , we have again @xmath99 for @xmath100 for the same reasons as discussed before .",
    "the interference is maximal half way through the perfect state transfer . in this case , the interference is not small ( compare fig .  [ fig1 ] and fig .",

    "a physical realization of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) was proposed in @xcite .",

    "( [ ipfin ] ) is not valid anymore , and the question of how much interference is used in the quantum state transfer needs to be reassessed .",

    "the quantity @xmath82 decreases with @xmath105 until the time required for the state to be transferred from the first to the last qubit is approximately equal to @xmath114 .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite . for large @xmath105 ,",
    "@xmath82 is close to one due to excitations that are created in the chain during this time interval .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the reduced interference at the global maxima of @xmath115 in the time interval [ 0,@xmath111 .",
    "once again , interference decreases with increasing @xmath82 , and vice versa , but this time as a function of the parameter @xmath105 .",
    "for very small @xmath105 , we have nearly perfect state transfer ( almost no equipartition and coherence ) , therefore the interference is small .",
    "it increases with @xmath105 , as the creation of excitations enhances the equipartition and sensitivity of the final state to the initial state . for large @xmath105 ,",
    "when a high value @xmath82 is achieved due to excitations created in the chain , interference is small .",
    "for example if the excitation is created on the last qubit , then the amplitude @xmath116 will be equal to one .",
    "it corresponds to nearly stochastic transfer , since the final probabilities to find the last qubit in the state @xmath104 or @xmath29 are almost independent of the initial state .",
    "the result that perfect quantum state transfer is possible ( and realized ! ) without quantum interference is rather counter - intuitive .",
    "it is natural to wonder what happens within the chain .",
    "let us therefore open the black box and study the interference in the propagation of the state of the entire chain ( called `` full interference '' @xmath117 in the following , where confusion is possible ) for chains which conserve the number of excitations .",

    "knowing the eigenvalues and eigenenergies of ( [ hlyakhov ] ) allows us to find the matrix elements @xmath120 and numerically calculate the full interference as a function of time and of the number of the qubits in the chain , restricting ourselves again to the @xmath121-dimensional hilbert space of the states in eq .",

( [ hlyakhov]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as we can see in fig",
    ".  [ fig1tot ] , the full interference is close to zero if the fidelity is close to one .",
    "the reason is that the time that is required for the excitation to be transferred from the first to the last qubit ( the time of the first fidelity maximum ) is approximately equal to the time that it takes for the excitation to travel from qubit @xmath123 to the end of the chain and then back to qubit @xmath124 ( and so on ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fign6 ] , where the fidelities @xmath125 and the normalized full interference are shown for the chain of @xmath126 qubits .",
    "we can see that the interference is minimal in the region where local maxima of the fidelities are located .",
    "when all maxima are close to one , then , independently of the initial state , the final state will have small equipartition and therefore the interference is small .    when the fidelity maximum goes down , the corresponding full interference increases rapidly ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig1tot ] , @xmath112 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath127 is very sensitive to the amplitude distribution of the final state over the qubits . here",
    "the amplitude of the spin @xmath128 in the final state is @xmath129 .    for short chains the fidelity maxima",
    "correspond to minimal dispersion . for longer chains ,",
    "the minima of the full interference are shifted with respect to the fidelity maxima .",
    "this is due to that fact that a maximal amplitude of the state `` up '' of the last qubit does not necessarily correspond to the minimal dispersion as measured by interference , which takes into account all possible input states .",
    "another feature of the interference graph are intermediate minima which correspond to a partial localization of the excitation on the intermediate qubits .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "[ fig1tot ] ( @xmath112 ) there are clear shallow local interference minima that correspond to localization of the excitation on the nearest neighbor of the initial qubit , see fig .  [ fign3 ] .",
    "deep minima correspond to localization of the excitation after the state is transferred through the whole chain . for longer chains ,",
    "the times when the excitation is localized on intermediate qubits depends on the initial state , i.e.  the fidelity maxima do not exactly coincide ( see fig .",
    "[ fign6 ] ) .",
    "therefore these small features are less pronounced .",
    "the full ( normalized ) interference @xmath4 for a chain with reduced coupling constants between the first and the last pair of qubits is shown as green solid line in fig .",
    "@xmath4 oscillates rapidly on the time scale of the state transfer from the first to the last qubit , with an envelope whose upper boundary perfectly correlates with the oscillations of the reduced interference and an amplitude which is , for @xmath94 , about a tenth of the amplitude of the reduced interference @xmath13 .",
    "this behavior is indeed to be expected from the fact that @xmath4 is a sum of equipartition measures for all initial states localized on any qubit in the chain , whereas @xmath13 measures equipartition only on the first and last qubit .",
    "as the state transfer is basically perfect ( and therefore @xmath130 for @xmath0 and at the time of optimal transfer @xmath131 ) , the lack of this contribution to the equipartition measure leads to a minimum in the envelope of @xmath4 at @xmath0 and @xmath131 .",
    "at the same time , the maximum of the envelope of @xmath4 halfway through the state transfer ( corresponding to an additional contribution of about 0.1 to @xmath4 ) indicates that the equipartition of the first and last qubit captures the essence of the equipartition in the chain for an initial state localized on the first qubit .",
    "this agrees with ref .",
    "@xcite since there is only a small amplitude for an excitation inside the chain during the state transfer .",
    "therefore the equipartition between the first and the last qubit gives the main contribution to the full interference .",
    "in summary we have calculated the interference during the transfer of a quantum state through several types of one - dimensional spin chains with time - independent nearest - neighbor coupling constants , both for chains which do or do not conserve the number of spin excitations .",
    "we have shown that for a high - fidelity transfer the reduced interference of the propagator of just the first and last qubits is very small , and vanishes for perfect transfer .",
    "this can be understood from energy conservation and the fact that interference measures , besides phase coherence , the equipartition of the final states for all computational states taken as input states .",
    "the full interference of the entire chain ( propagated unitarily ) shows rapid oscillations on the time scale of a complete transfer . for a chain with reduced coupling constants between the first and the last pair of qubits the envelope of these oscillations",
    "follows the reduced interference .",
    "thus , interference is not only valuable tool for investigating quantum algorithms , but also gives us a deeper insight into the dynamics of quantum state transfer ."
