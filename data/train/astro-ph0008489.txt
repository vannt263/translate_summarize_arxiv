    "the eddington luminosity is the maximum luminosity allowed for a _ stationary _ spherical , homogeneous , non - relativistic and fully ionised system .",
    "if one allows motion , then a _ steady state _ super - eddington configuration generally does not exist unless the system is just marginally super - eddington or it has a very high mass loss rate .",
    "nevertheless , nature does find a way to construct steady state configurations in which super - eddington luminosities exist with only a relatively small mass loss rate .",
    "this was perhaps best demonstrated with @xmath0 carinae s giant eruption .",
    "@xmath0 carinae was clearly super - eddington during its 20 year long eruption ( see for instance the review by @xcite ) .",
    "yet , it was shown that the observed mass loss and velocity are inconsistent with a homogeneous solution for the wind ( @xcite ) .",
    "basically , the sonic point obtained from the observed conditions necessarily has to reside too high in the atmosphere , at an optical depth of only @xmath1 to @xmath2 , while the critical point in a homogeneous atmosphere necessarily has to reside at significantly deeper optical depths .",
    "the inconsistency arises because the sonic point and the critical point have to coincide in a steady state solution , while nowhere within the plausible space of parameters such a solution exists .",
    "a solution was proposed in which the atmosphere of @xmath0 carinae is inhomogeneous , or porous ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inhomogeneity is a natural result of the instabilities of atmospheres that are close to the eddington luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inhomogeneities , or ` porosity ' , reduce the effective opacity and increase the effective eddington luminosity ( @xcite ) .    in this paper , we are interested in understanding the wind generated in cases in which the luminosity is super - eddington . to do so , it is advantageous to find a class of objects for which better data than for @xmath0 car exists .",
    "one such class of objects is novae .",
    "novae are a very good population to analyze in order to understand the behaviour of steady state super - eddington winds .",
    "the main reasons are :    1 .",
    "the mass and luminosity are better known than for many other objects .",
    "for example , although @xmath0 carinae was clearly super eddington , it is not clear by how much it was so : its mass can be anywhere between @xmath3 and @xmath4 and its luminosity during the eruption is even less accurately known .",
    "the ejected mass could have been between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is not accurate enough for our purposes here .",
    "the opacity where the sonic point is expected to be located is governed by thomson scattering . in agb and post - agb stars that generate strong radiatively driven winds ,",
    "the opacity is a very sensitive function of the local parameters of the gas at the sonic point .",
    "thus , even though their observed mass and luminosity can be fairly accurately deduced from the observations , the _ modified _ eddington parameter which should take into account the opacity of the dust , for example , is not known reasonably well .",
    "since the luminosity during the super - eddington episode of novae eruptions can be significantly above the eddington limit , the inaccuracy of @xmath7 is less critical to the exact value of the mass loss . in objects that shine very close to the eddington limit for a long duration , with a relatively small mass loss rate",
    ", the theory can not give precise predictions .",
    "thus , if for example the winds of the most luminous wr stars arises because the objects are marginally super - eddington , it would be hard to compare their observations to the theory presented here because the accuracy in the determination of @xmath8 will be rather poor .",
    "4 .   novae generally exhibit a ` bolometric plateau ' in which the bolometric luminosity decreases slowly over a relatively long duration , significantly longer than the dynamical time scale . therefore ,",
    "if this luminosity is super - eddington , then clearly a steady state model for the super - eddington flow should be constructed .",
    "this is clearly the case with two specific novae :  and .",
    "we exclude from the discussion here the very fast novae for which this property is least pronounced .",
    "the fact that the ` bolometric plateau ' is sometimes observed to be super - eddington does not presently have any good theoretical explanation .",
    "the steady state burning of the post maximum of novae is often predicted to be given or at least approximated by the core - mass luminosity relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the classical core - mass luminosity relation increases monotonically with the mass of the wd and saturates at the eddington limit .",
    "it does not yield super - eddington luminosities .",
    "the observations of super - eddington luminosities over durations much longer than the dynamic time scale , lead us to the hypothesis that bright novae must have a porous atmosphere .",
    "a porous atmosphere with a reduced effective opacity will naturally give a core - mass luminosity relation that increases monotonically with mass beyond the classical eddington limit , providing the arena for steady state super - eddington winds .",
    "it is these winds which are the subject of this paper . in section [ sec : wind ] we present the ` wind theory ' for super - eddington atmospheres . in section [ sec : novae ] , we apply the wind theory to two specific novae that were clearly super - eddington over a long duration , to the nova population in general and to @xmath0 carinae and compare the results with observations .",
    "what have we learned from @xmath0 carinae ?",
    "@xmath0 car has shown us that an object can be super - eddington for a duration much longer than the dynamical time scale while driving a wind which is significantly thinner than one should expect in a homogeneous wind solution . when one tries to construct a steady state wind solution , one has to place the sonic point at the critical point  where the net forces on a mass element vanish .",
    "if a system is in steady state and super - eddington , then the critical point has to reside where alternative means of transporting the energy flux , namely by convection or advection with the flow , become inefficient .",
    "this point however , happens relatively deep in the atmosphere ( @xmath9 ) , implying that the mass loss @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the sound velocity ) , is very large .",
    "in fact , the mass loss rate becomes of order @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , if the radius of the system is fixed , then because a minimum energy flux of @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 being the escape velocity ) has to be supplied in order to pump the material out of the gravitational well , one obtains that unless @xmath15 , the radiation will not be able to provide the work needed ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that below a certain luminosity and radius of the system , there is no steady state solution .",
    "clearly , the system would try to expand its outer layers ( that are driven outward but can not reach infinity ) , thereby reducing the escape velocity , until a steady state can be reached .",
    "one would expect that as time progresses , the sonic point of the wind would move monotonically downwards , pushing more and more material upwards thereby expanding the atmosphere and accelerating more mass until all the available luminosity would be used - up to pump material out of the well .",
    "if this expectation is realized , @xmath0 car would have appeared as a faint object with high mass loss at low velocities . in other words , observations of @xmath0 car",
    "suggest that down to the optical depth of at most @xmath16 , which is the deepest that the sonic point could be located ( @xcite ) , the total mass is @xmath17 , implying that this part of the envelope should have been in steady state for time scales longer than @xmath18 months",
    ". this hypothetical steady state is inconsistent with @xmath19 car trying to reach an equilibrium in which most of the radiation is used up to accelerate a very large amount of mass to low velocities , the star has been notably super - eddington for a long duration without accelerating more and more mass at lower velocities .",
    "we will soon show that novae , at least during their ` bolometric plateau ' defy the eddington limit .",
    "in some cases at least , a steady state super - eddington configuration is reached in which the kinetic energy in the flow plus the rate in which gravitational energy is pumped is only a small or moderate fraction of the total radiative energy flux at the base of the wind .",
    "this too is inconsistent with a sonic point located deep inside the atmosphere .",
    "so , how did @xmath0 car circumvent its bloating up ? it was proposed by shaviv ( ) that the solution to the problem is in having a porous atmosphere .",
    "in such an atmosphere , density perturbations naturally reduce the effective opacity @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the radiative force is decreased and the effective eddington limit is increased to : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the microscopic opacity . when @xmath23 , the eddington limit @xmath24 corresponds to the _ classical _ eddington limit . in most other cases , where the microscopic opacity @xmath25 is larger than the thomson opacity , @xmath24 corresponds to a lower _ modified _ eddington luminosity . in the rest of this work , we shall not explicitly state whether the eddington limit is ` classical ' or ` modified ' .",
    "the distinction should be made according to the underlying microscopic opacity , which is close to that of thomson scattering in the specific cases studied here .",
    "we shall however make the important distinction between the ` modified ' and the ` effective ' eddington luminosity , the latter being the effective eddington luminosity in a non - homogeneous system .    a mechanism which converts the homogeneous layers into inhomogeneous",
    "was suggested by shaviv ( ) .",
    "it is demonstrated that as the radiative flux through the atmospheres surpasses a critical eddington parameter of @xmath26 ( the exact numerical value depends on the boundary conditions ) , the atmosphere becomes unstable to at least two different instabilities , both of which operate on the dynamical time scale ( namely , the sound crossing time of a scale height ) .",
    "consequently , as the radiative flux approaches the eddington limit and surpasses it , the radiation triggers the transition of the atmosphere from a homogeneous one to an inhomogeneous one .",
    "the inhomogeneities increase the effective eddington limit thereby functionally keeping the radiation flux at a sub - eddington level ; namely , even if @xmath27 , the optically thick regions experience a @xmath28 .",
    "other instabilities that operate in more complex environments could too be important and contribute to this transition .",
    "for example , @xmath29-mode instabilities ( @xcite ) or the instability of dynamically detached outer layers ( @xcite ) operate under more complex opacity laws .",
    "the instability of ` photon bubbles ' appears when strong magnetic fields are present ( @xcite ) . in principle , since the adiabatic index approaches the critical value of 4/3 for instability as the eddington limit is approached , many mechanisms which are otherwise unimportant do become important .",
    "the ` porosity ' reduces the effective opacity only as long as the perturbations are optically thick .",
    "therefore , a wind will necessarily be generated from the regions in which the perturbations become optically thin , since from these regions upwards the effective opacity will be the normal ` microscopic ' one and the effective eddington limit will return to be the classical one .    _",
    "the @xmath30 case_:the details of the geometry ( or inhomogeneities ) of the regions depend on the instability at play , and for example can be in the form of ` chimneys ' or ` photon bubbles ' .",
    "the lowered opacity is achieved by funneling the radiation through regions with a much lower than average density .",
    "these regions can be super - eddington even when the mean @xmath31 parameter is smaller than unity .",
    "in such cases , mass loss should be driven in the super - eddington ` chimneys ' of lower density .",
    "these atmospheres are then expected to be very dynamic .",
    "once any accelerated mass element reaches the optically thin part of the atmosphere , it will start to experience an average force that is at a sub - eddington value and the mass flow will stagnate , probably forming something which looks like ` geysers ' .",
    "( it is very unlikely that the escape velocity will be attainable in the ` chimneys ' since shocks would probably limit the flow to velocities not much larger than the speed of sound ) . a wind",
    "could then be generated in the optically thin part of the atmosphere through the standard line driving mechanism ( @xcite , or for example @xcite and references therein ) , with the notable consideration that the base of the wind is clumpy .",
    "_ the @xmath32 case_:when @xmath27 on the other hand , a continuum driven wind has to be generated .",
    "the reason is clear .",
    "since the perturbations have to be optically thick to affect ( and reduce ) the opacity , at a low enough optical depth one would expect to return back to a super - eddington flow . what is this optical depth ?",
    "if we climb up the thick yet porous atmosphere , since it is effectively sub - eddington , the average density will decay exponentially with height . at some point",
    ", the density will be low enough that a typical perturbation ` element ' becomes optically thin .",
    "since the perturbations are expected to be of order a scale height in size ( @xcite ) , this depth would be where a scale height has an optical _ width _ of order unity .",
    "beyond this point , the typical perturbation on scales of order the a scale height can not reduce the opacity .",
    "this is the place where the sonic point should be located for a steady wind to exist .",
    "more specifically , if the flux corresponds to an eddington parameter @xmath31 , then the optical depth at which perturbations can not reduce the effective eddington parameter to unity should scale with @xmath8 .",
    "the reason is that the decrease of the luminosity by the effective opacity should be proportional to the deviation of the actual luminosity from the eddington one .",
    "namely , when close to the eddington limit , a blob with the same geometry needs a smaller density fluctuation and with it a smaller change in the opacity , to reduce the effective opacity by the amount needed to become eddington .",
    "thus , when closer to the eddington limit , the sonic point can sit higher in the atmosphere .",
    "we shall elaborate this point to show that this is indeed the case in  [ sec : criticalpoint ]      the above considerations lead us to propose the following structure of a super - eddington wind ( hereafter sew ) .",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] for the proposed structure of a super - eddington atmosphere ( one with @xmath33 ) and the sew that it generates .",
    "four main regions can be identified in the atmosphere and they are :    * region a : a convective envelope  where the density is sufficiently high such that the excess flux above the eddington luminosity is advected using convection .",
    "the radiative luminosity left is below the classical eddington limit :",
    "it was shown by joss , salpeter & ostriker ( ) that convection is always excited before the eddington limit is reached .",
    "thus , if the density is high enough and the total flux is super - eddington , this region has to exist .",
    "* region b : a zone with lower densities , in which convection becomes inefficient .",
    "instabilities render the atmosphere inhomogeneous , thus facilitating the transfer of flux without exerting as much force .",
    "the effective eddington luminosity is larger than the classical eddington luminosity .",
    "@xmath0 car has shown us that the existence of this region allows for the steady state outflow during its 20 year long eruption ( @xcite ) .",
    "* region c : a region in which the effect of the inhomogeneities disappears and the luminosity is again super - eddington .",
    "when perturbations arising from the instabilities , which are expected to be of order the scale height in size , become transparent , the effective opacity tends to the microscopic value and the effective eddington limit tends to the classical value . at the transition between ( b ) and ( c ) ,",
    "the effective eddington is equal to the total luminosity .",
    "this critical point is also the sonic point in a steady state wind . above the transition surface , @xmath36 and we have a super sonic wind .",
    "this wind is expected to be optically thick .",
    "* region d : the photosphere and above .",
    "since the wind is generally thick , the transition between regions ( c ) and ( d ) is far above the sonic surface .",
    "paramount to the calculation of the mass loss rate in super eddington systems is the location of the critical point ( separating regions ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) , which corresponds to the sonic point of the wind generated at steady state .",
    "therefore , we should try and estimate its location and density .",
    "its definition is the location where the net _ average _ force on a gas element vanishes , or in other words , it is where the effective eddington parameter @xmath37 is unity . to calculate it",
    ", we need to know the functional behavior of the effective opacity as a function of height .",
    "the general behavior clearly depends on the characteristics of the nonlinear state of the porous atmosphere . however , this state is still part of an open problem under investigation and is therefore unknown .",
    "it will be shown , nevertheless , that the unknown geometrical factors that determine the mass loss can be pin - pointed while some other unknowns , such as @xmath38 , actually cancel out to first approximation .",
    "the effective opacity deep inside the atmosphere reduces @xmath31 to sub - eddington values .",
    "however , higher up in the atmosphere where the perturbations become optically thin , the reduction in effective opacity diminishes to zero . in the thin limit , the effective opacity returns back to its microscopic value .",
    "we therefore write the opacity ( per unit mass ) of the medium as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the equivalent optical width of a pressure scale height if the medium had been homogeneous .",
    "@xmath41 is the effective @xmath31 in the limit of large optical depths .",
    "it is a function of @xmath31 which is unknown at this stage since we do nt have a model for the nonlinear behavior of the inhomogeneities .",
    "the function @xmath42 should be obtained from a non linear model ( which is part of work in progress ) .",
    "the function @xmath43 gives the functional reduction of the opacity as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "it should depend on the geometrical characteristics of the inhomogeneities .",
    "for @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath20 will approach the microscopic value of the opacity @xmath25 .",
    "for large optical depths , we have @xmath47 , and obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    next",
    ", the sonic point for a steady - state transonic flow must be located at the critical point , where the local @xmath50 is unity , i.e. , where @xmath51 .",
    "we therefore have : @xmath52    let us assume that for small optical depths , @xmath53 and that for large optical depths , @xmath54 .",
    "if we know the constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the powers @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we can estimate the average density at the sonic point . to do that",
    ", we need a relation between the average density @xmath59 and @xmath40 . to this goal",
    "we write the pressure scale height @xmath60 as @xmath61 the constant @xmath62 relates the effective speed of sound to the adiabatic one ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "if for example the atmosphere is isothermal , we have @xmath64 .",
    "if its temperature gradient is derived from radiation transfer and it has a constant opacity , we find @xmath65 .",
    "the factor @xmath66 originates from the ` puffing - up ' of the atmosphere due to the radiative force ( which reduces the effective gravity ) .",
    "let the average density be @xmath59 , then the optical width of a pressure scale height if the layer is homogeneous is given by : @xmath67 therefore : @xmath68    for the small optical width limit , where @xmath69 , one has : @xmath70    however , small @xmath44 s are obtained when @xmath69 or @xmath71 , namely , only when @xmath31 is very close to the eddington limit . under such conditions : @xmath72    the opposite limit of large optical depths corresponds to @xmath73 , and consequently to @xmath74 as well .",
    "in this limit we have : @xmath75 or @xmath76 where for the last approximation we used @xmath77 .",
    "clearly , for the particular case of @xmath78 we obtain that both in the _ large _ and _ small _ optical depth regimes : @xmath79 it is interesting to note that for this particular set of power laws , both regimes do not depend on the value of @xmath41 as it cancels out : the factor @xmath66 introduced by the puffing up of the atmosphere cancels the factor @xmath80 which appears because when the atmosphere is closer to the effective eddington limit , smaller changes in the effective opacity are needed to reach the critical point .",
    "we now proceed to show that the above simple power law scalings are indeed obtained under both limits .",
    "since the arguments given are somewhat heuristic , the function @xmath81 is also calculated analytically in the appendix for two simple cases under both limits , giving the same power laws .",
    "to strengthen the argumentation even more , we also use published results for an inhomogeneous system with a particular type of random statistical distribution ( that of a markovian statistics ) for which the opacity ( and @xmath82 ) can be calculated rigorously .    to find the power laws , we assume for simplicity that the medium is divided into regions of higher density @xmath83 and volume @xmath84 and regions of lower density @xmath85 and volume @xmath86 . from conservation of mass",
    "it follows that @xmath87 or @xmath88 .    * the optically thick limit * : the optically thick limit can be generally described by fig .  [ fig : thick ] .",
    "the reduced effective opacity is obtained by concentrating mass in dense ` blobs ' and forming rarefied medium in between through which most of the radiation flux is funneled through .",
    "simplistically , we have high density regions with a volume @xmath89 , a density @xmath90 and a reduced flux @xmath91 and low density regions with @xmath92 , @xmath93 and higher typical fluxes @xmath94 .    in the absence of inhomogeneities , we would have had an average density @xmath59 and a flux @xmath95 .",
    "for a given temperature gradient , we typically have @xmath96 .",
    "the result is accurate if the perturbations in the medium have a large vertical to horizontal aspect ratio , such that the temperature perturbations are negligible . under",
    "more general perturbation geometries , this approximation is only a rough estimate but it should give the typical change expected in the fluxes .    the total average force @xmath97 acting on a volume which contains many inhomogeneous elements , is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the force corresponding to the homogeneous case .",
    "that is , the average force does not change for a given fixed average temperature gradient .",

    "if we look at fig .",
    "[ fig : thick ] , we see that there exists a finite volume at the interface between the high density regions and the low density ones with a total cross section of about one optical depth .",

    "one can neglect @xmath108 when compared with @xmath109 or assume that @xmath110 is close to unity .",

    "furthermore , since the total mass ejected has a lower bound of @xmath256 , and is probably more of the order of @xmath257 , we should take the kinetic energy of the outflow into account . since the ejecta is moving at about @xmath258 ( @xcite ) ,",

    "we correct the luminosities to include the better distance determination by gill & obrian ( ) .",
    "a steady state model is probably appropriate for two reasons :    1 .",
    "circumstantial evidence : kato & hachisu ( ) compared their steady state model for winds to the results of a dynamical evolution of prialnik ( ) and found relatively good agreement , implying that a steady state solution is valid for most of the nova evolution .",
    "2 .   physical reasons : a wind with a terminal velocity of @xmath264 originates from a typical radius @xmath265 that has an escape velocity of order @xmath264 . two conditions should therefore be satisfied for the wind to be in a steady state .",
    "first , the sub - sonic region beneath the base of the wind should be acoustically connected on time scales shorter than the typical evolution time of the system .",

    "irrespective of the theoretical argumentation for which spectrum is formed closer to the photosphere , the circumstantial evidence points to the principal spectrum .",
    "this is because the velocities obtained from the principal spectrum are similar to those obtained by measurements of the nebular expansion years after the eruption .",
    "namely , the principal spectrum provides the velocity of the bulk of the material while the diffuse enhanced spectrum probably gives the velocity of the small amount of material that is initially injected at high speeds . in  for example",
    ", the principal spectrum gives velocities in the range @xmath295 to @xmath296 .",
    "the diffuse enhanced spectrum is in the range @xmath297 to @xmath298 .",
    "clearly , the principal spectrum is closer to the observed expansion velocity of the nebula at @xmath299 ( @xcite ) .    in order to obtain an estimate for what the principal velocity is",
    ", we take the two relations that relate @xmath274 to @xmath300 and @xmath301 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and relate the two velocities .",
    "the @xmath302 observed for the emission lines , then corresponds to a principal spectrum of @xmath303 .    taking the above considerations into account",
    ", the analysis proceeds in a manner similar to that of  with a few notable exceptions .",
    "in addition to @xmath191 , @xmath268 and @xmath269 , we leave the velocity @xmath222 as a free parameter and let it vary from 750 km s@xmath250 to 2000 km s@xmath250 , corresponding to the complete range of possible velocities , without actually any prejudice for or against which spectral velocities should be taken .",
    "we assume the velocity to be constant with time , which towards the end of the eruption , when small mass outflows are expected ( and therefore a smaller observational footprint ) , can be a bad approximation .",
    "we therefore fit the data only to the first month of observations .",
    "since the dimensionality of the free parameter space is too large , we do not plot the contours of @xmath270 but instead find and plot the value of @xmath191 which minimizes it given @xmath268 , @xmath269 and @xmath222 .",
    "moreover , since the observed luminosity exhibits rather large variations , as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc88bol ] , a smoothed functional behaviour is adopted .",
    "a fit of the form @xmath304 yields the best fit .",
    "the result of the aforementioned procedure are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmcw ] . without any prejudice for @xmath305 , @xmath269 or @xmath264 ( except for limiting them to a reasonable range of @xmath306 , @xmath307 and @xmath308 )",
    ", one finds that the wind model can adequately explain the results with a wind parameter in the range : _",
    "this result is consistent with both the one obtained from  and the one expected from the sew theory for @xmath178 somewhat smaller than unity and/or @xmath124 either closer to 1 or much closer to @xmath309 than the nominal value of @xmath115 .",
    "the case of @xmath0 carinae is quite different from the novae analyzed .",
    "first , the systems are entirely different . instead of a solar mass type wd ,",
    "@xmath0 car is a blue super - giant with a mass of order of @xmath310 to @xmath311 . while the super - eddington phase of novae lasts of order a few months",
    "during which there is mass loss with a typical rate of @xmath312 , the giant eruption of @xmath0 car which started around 1840 , lasted for 20 years and exhibited a mass loss rate of order @xmath313 .",
    "a second difference appears in the way the analysis proceeds .",
    "while the novae analyzed had a detailed evolution of the temperature and luminosity , all that we have for @xmath0 car is an estimated average luminosity during the 20 year eruption and an estimate for the integrated mass loss .",
    "yet we apply the theory and stress that the very same theory is applicable to a wide range of systems .    following davidson ( ) , we adopt the following parameters for the eruption of @xmath0 car : duration of 20 years .",
    "integrated radiated flux of @xmath314 .",
    "ejected mass of @xmath315 to @xmath316 , and a mass velocity at infinity of @xmath317 .",
    "the mass adopted is @xmath318 which can correspond to the estimate of @xmath319 if it is a part of a double star and @xmath320 if it is single .    to obtain @xmath191 from the observables",
    ", we first assume that the mass loss rate was constant and equal to @xmath321 .",
    "given the aforementioned nominal values for the luminosity , velocity at infinity , stellar mass and mass loss rate , we can iterate for the values of @xmath215 and @xmath214 according to the procedure outlined at the end of  [ sec : load ] and the fitting done to each point of   in the beginning of  [ sec : applnfh ] . the difference between the cases of @xmath0 car and  is that here we only have one data point ( corresponding to the ` averaged ' eruption ) and that it does not include a temperature measurement .",
    "therefore , we do not have enough observables to obtain a @xmath270 fit .",
    "namely , we have the correct number free of parameters to fit the data exactly .",
    "the set of nominal values for the observables therefore results with a particular value for @xmath191 . to obtain the error in the estimate",
    ", we take each observable and change it to the extremes allowed by its error bar .",
    "this gives the error in @xmath191 induced by that particular observable .",
    "the errors from the different observables are then added in quadrature .",
    "the wind parameter that we find is = 16.2 12 .",
    "the greatest contribution to the error arises from the inaccuracy of the average luminosity while the second largest contribution , which is half the size of the first , comes from the inaccuracy of the mass ejected .",
    "although the errors in @xmath191 are larger than those obtained for , the range obtained from @xmath0 car includes entirely the range obtained from .",
    "namely , the results are consistent and the value obtained from  should be taken as the best estimate for @xmath191 .",
    "although we can not say at the moment anything quantitative about the steady state luminosity that will be attained without proper knowledge of the properties of the porous atmosphere , we can understand why super - eddington fluxes are a natural result .",
    "the steady state luminosity at the post - maximum of novae is generally supposed to be given or at least approximated by the core - mass luminosity relation ( cmlr , e.g. , @xcite ) which describes systems in which a burning shell is situated on an inert ( and hence fixed ) core ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cmlr however , saturates at the eddington luminosity .",
    "so , how can it describe cases which were clearly super - eddington ?",
    "a clear physical understanding of the cmlr can be found in tuchman et  al .",
    "( ) who studied a system composed of an inert core on top of which there is a burning shell , a radiative layer with sharp gradients and a convective layer on top of that .",
    "they showed that the conditions above the radiative layer are unimportant for the determination of the burning luminosity ( thus , the mass of the envelope is unimportant ) . only the burning layer and the radiative layer on top of it",
    "affect the luminosity .",
    "how would a porous atmosphere change that ?",
    "since any inhomogeneities are expected to form in the top part of the atmosphere ( above the convective layer ) , it does not change the analysis of tuchman et  al .",
    "( ) . that is the case only as long as a consistent solution for the top part of the atmosphere is obtainable",
    ".    however , as the mass of the wd increases and with it the eddington parameter , the top part of the atmosphere becomes unstable against formation of inhomogeneities and once these are formed , allows a larger radiative flux for the same average temperature and density gradients . if this larger flux is close enough ( or larger than ) the eddington luminosity , one of the main assumptions in the analysis of tuchman et  al .",
    "( ) breaks down because the radiative layer above the burning shell necessarily has to become convective ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , an additional branch for the mass - core luminosity relation becomes possible in which the top part of the atmosphere is inhomogeneous and below it , all the way down to the burning shell , the envelope is convective .",
    "since the luminosity now depends on the photospheric conditions ( the convective layer adjusts itself to ` relate ' the conditions below and on top of it ) , the core - mass luminosity relation can lose its insensitivity to the parameters of the envelope .",
    "one of the seemingly odd behaviour displayed by a large majority of the classical nova eruptions is a transition phase .",
    "if it appears , it starts once the visual magnitude has decayed by 3 to 4 magnitudes . during the transition phase",
    ", the light curve can display strong deepening , quasi - periodic oscillations , erratic changes or other complicated behaviour .",
    "the origin of the transition phase is not clear and more than one explanation had been suggested .",
    "for example , the transition phase roughly corresponds to the stage when the photosphere has shrunk to the size of the binary separation such that the companion star can stir up the envelope to produce non trivial behaviour .",
    "the sew theory naturally introduces another explanation for the transition phase . if we look at the @xmath215 - @xmath214 trajectory of  in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] , one can not avoid the extrapolation of the trajectory into the zone of ` no steady state configuration ' . what is this region ?    the mass loss rate is determined by the luminosity .",
    "the mechanism that generates this wind does not depend on whether the luminosity is sufficient or not to carry the material from the sonic point to infinity .",
    "if the radius of the sonic point is too small and the escape velocity too high , the wind simply stagnates before leaving the potential well . as predicted by owocki & gayley ( ) , no steady state solution for the wind exists under such conditions .",
    "in other words , the wind model predicts that no steady state could be reached if the radius falls too quickly .",
    "this appears to be a likely scenario in the case of  if one extrapolates its trajectory seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] , and indeed ,  was observed to have a transition phase in which the luminosity faded dramatically .",
    "both the fading and the erratic or quasi - periodic behaviour seem like a natural result here . from fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] , it is apparent that @xmath219 can fade dramatically before entering the transition phase .",
    "this arises from the fact that close to the transition phase almost all of the flux is used to pay for the potential toll . once in the ` domain of no steady state '",
    "the non trivial 2d or 3d flows that must result could potentially result with non trivial variability .",
    "the faded and/or variable luminosity phase is expected to end when the luminosity at the base of the wind falls below the eddington limit , shutting off the sew , at which point the ` naked ' white dwarf should emerge .",
    "we have previously treated two specific novae for which the temporal evolution of the luminosity and temperature is known in detail .",
    "we now turn to describe the nova population in general for which only the average behaviour is known .",
    "to do so , we create a template nova as a function of white dwarf mass and explore its properties . its predicted mass loss",
    "is then compared with the observed integrated mass loss .",
    "clearly , we expect the theoretical prediction to provide the guide line to which the _ average _ observed behaviour should be compared to .",
    "let us first estimate the average mass loss in novae . to this goal",
    ", we use the average trends in the functional behaviour of the luminosity , decay time and velocity as a function of white dwarf mass to predict the integrated mass loss during the super - eddington episode . specifically , we use the following :    1 .",
    "we use the average relation between @xmath274 , the time it takes for the visual luminosity to decay by 3 magnitudes , to the mass of the wd , as is given by livio ( ) .",
    "we assume that the photospheric velocity is given by the velocity of the principal spectrum .",
    "this velocity has an average relation to the decay time @xmath274 , as given for example by warner ( ) .",
    "we take the peak bolometric luminosity to be the peak visual luminosity .",
    "this is permissible since novae s maxima are generally in the visual .",
    "@xmath322 is related to @xmath274 , and therefore to @xmath305 , by relations given by livio ( ) .",
    "using @xmath305 , @xmath222 and @xmath323 , we find the eddington parameter @xmath215 at the base of the wind during the peak brightness .",
    "we do so using the relations given in section [ sec : load ] .",
    "we assume that the bolometric luminosity at the _ base _ decays exponentially ( or the magnitude linearly ) .",
    "that is , it has the form : @xmath324 . since we expect the transition phase to arise when the luminosity approaches the eddington luminosity , and since the transition phase usually sets in after the visual decayed by 3 to 4 magnitudes , or about 3.5 on average , we can relate @xmath274 to the exponential decay constant of the base luminosity @xmath325 : .",
    "few words of explanation are in order .",
    "it is conceivable that as the nova eruption proceeds , since the amount of fuel is fixed and all of it burns simultaneously , we do not get a strict steady state cigar - type burning and fixed bolometric luminosity .",
    "the bolometric luminosity must change gradually with time .",
    "it is customary to assume as a first approximation that @xmath326 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a more realistic treatment that more accurately describes the observations , is to assume a gradual , though slow , decline expressed as an exponential decay with a long time scale ( see for instance fig .  [",
    "fig : lmc88bol ] ) . for comparison",
    ", we also repeat the whole calculation using a linear decline of the form @xmath327 and show that the exact form of decay is not critical .",
    "if we integrate the mass loss rate given by the wind theory ( eq .  [ eq : masslossrate ] ) , we find that the total ejected material during the super - eddington episode is : m _ & = & _ 0^t_e dt = c",
    "v_s _ 0^t_e ( l -  _ ) dt + & & c v_s _ ( _ 0 -1 -(_0 ) ) , where @xmath328 is the time it takes the bolometric luminosity to decline to the eddington limit .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : masslossmass ] as a function of the mass of the white dwarf , together with the observed determinations of ejecta masses , as was complied by hack _ et  al .",
    "we first notice that in those cases where multiple determinations were obtained , there are large differences between measurements .",
    "these differences should therefore be taken as the typical ` error ' in cases where only one determination was performed .",
    "the different theoretical predictions correspond to changing the wind parameter @xmath191 to within the possible range of @xmath329 , when assuming a linear instead of an exponential decay , and when taking into account the natural scatter in the @xmath274 ",
    "@xmath305 relation of livio ( ) .    to within the large uncertainties in the ejecta mass determinations ( which have a @xmath272 scatter of 0.54 dex ) ,",
    "the prediction and observations appear to be in good agreement .",
    "the super - eddington episode of novae could account for the bulk , if not all , of the ejected material as a function of @xmath268 .",
    "one should nevertheless note that the logarithmic average of the observations : @xmath330 is on the upper side but still within the allowed region predicted by the sew theory ( which has only a small functional dependence on @xmath305 ) . since some of the ejecta mass determinations are susceptible to clumpiness , taking the latter into account should tend to reduce the logarithmic average .",
    "if @xmath331 is a typical value and if characteristically about a half of the measurements actually measure @xmath332 , then the average of the mass loss would be smaller by about a 0.25 dex .",
    "several additional conclusions can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : masslossmass ] . the plateau in the predicted mass loss , where the mass loss does not depend on the mass of the white dwarf , extends from @xmath333 to @xmath334 .",
    "this appears to agree with observations .",
    "moreover , the extrapolation to wd masses beyond @xmath334 agrees with the mass loss observed from the very fast nova v1500 cygni , however , this extrapolation should be done cautiously because the assumption of a steady state wind is not strictly valid .",
    "the plateau predicted by the sew and seen in the observations is counter to theoretical predictions of the tnr process in which the general trend should be a smaller mass loss with larger wd masses .",
    "this theoretical trend arises from the fact that more massive wds are more compact and ignite the tnr after significantly less material is accreted .",
    "for some reason , this trend is not seen .",
    "the current tnr theory of novae tends to predict values which are about half an order to an order of magnitude smaller than the typical observations for large wd masses ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the implementation of the sew theory in numerical simulations of thermonuclear runaways in now underway with the purpose of finding the luminosity at the base of the wind self consistently as well as to see to what extent the incorporation of the sew changes the predicted amount of ejected material .",
    "let us return to fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] . recall that lines of constant radius are close to being vertical .",
    "one can see that for moderately ` loaded ' winds and @xmath215 of a few , an evolution in which the temperature increases but the apparent luminosity remains constant is possible if the radius does not decrease dramatically . under such conditions ,",
    "the luminosity at the base of the wind does fall off to get a higher and higher temperature .",
    "however , the lower mass loss predicted implies that less energy is needed to accelerate the material to infinity and so a larger fraction of the base luminosity remains after the wind has been accelerated .",
    "this could explain for example the constant bolometric luminosity observed for v1974 cygni 1992 ( @xcite ) and supports the early working hypothesis ( @xcite , @xcite ) that novae evolve with a bolometric luminosity which is almost constant , or at least one that does not vary dramatically .",
    "interestingly , depending on the load of the wind , the constant apparent bolometric flux can be either super or sub - eddington .",
    "that is , even if an apparent sub - eddington luminosity is observed , the system could still have been super - eddington over dynamically long durations . in such cases ,",
    "the kinetic and potential energies of the flow are important players in the total energy budget .",
    "clumpiness was already mentioned on several occasions . since it is important , it deserves a more concentrated discussion .",
    "sews are expected to be _ always _ clumpy as they are generated by an inhomogeneous atmosphere .",
    "the results for @xmath335 for  as compared to the results for @xmath191 of  do indicate that the winds are clumpy and that the clumpiness factor could be similar to that already observed in the optically thick winds of wolf - rayet stars , namely , @xmath336 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : w ] which depicts the @xmath191 obtained in the three discussed systems .",
    "clumpiness is also important because it tends to offset the estimates for the mass ejected from novae and other objects by overestimating it .",
    "this arises because many emission processes are more efficient at higher densities .",
    "for example , the opacity per unit mass of free - free emission is proportional to @xmath337 .",
    "thus , if the material is clumpy , then the higher density material is more efficient in producing the observed radiation than the case of the material spread evenly over the entire volume .    what is the expected size of the clumps",
    "since they originate from the inhomogeneities at the base of the wind , one needs to know the typical size @xmath117 of the atmospheric perturbations at this point . for the instabilities found to operate in thomson scattering atmosphere ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the typical size is of the order of the size of the pressure scale height @xmath338 ( say , @xmath339 ) .",
    "as the wind expands from its base , the clumps will keep their angular extent relative to the star .",
    "thus , the spherical harmonic @xmath340 at which the structure should peek should be of order : 2 = 2 , ~o(1 ) where @xmath11 is the speed of sound at the base of the wind , which is higher than that at the photosphere .",
    "the typical number obtained for novae , is @xmath341 .",
    "this is a large number and it implies that the ejecta has many small clumps in it . since the perturbations are expected to be dynamic and change over a sound crossing time , their vertical extent should be of order @xmath342 , at large distances , after the velocity dispersion had time to disperse the blobs vertically .",
    "the horizontal dispersion arising from velocities of order of the speed of sound are not important because of the horizontal expansion induced by rarefaction in the spherical geometry .",
    "the existence of steady state super - eddington outflows is an observational fact .",
    "one therefore needs to explain on one hand how atmospheres can sustain a super - eddington state and on the other , one needs to understand the winds that they generate .",
    "we have tried to present the following coherent picture : homogeneous atmospheres becomes inhomogeneous as the the radiative flux approaches the eddington limit .",
    "this is due to a plethora of instabilities .",
    "the particular governing instability depends on the details of the atmosphere . as a consequence of the inhomogeneity",
    ", the effective opacity is reduced as it is easier for the radiation to escape , and consequently , the effective eddington limit increases .",
    "super - eddington configurations are now possible because the bulk of the atmosphere is effectively sub - eddington so that the average is also sub - eddington .",
    "very deep layers advect the excess total luminosity above eddington by convection .",
    "higher in the atmosphere , where convection is inefficient , the eddington limit is effectively increased due to the reduced effective opacity .",
    "the top part of the atmosphere , where perturbations of order of the scale height become optically thin , has however to remain super - eddington .",
    "thus , these layers are pushed off by a continuum driven wind .",
    "by identifying the location of the critical point of the outflow , one can obtain a mass - loss luminosity relation .",
    "the relation , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : masslossrate ] ) is the main result of the paper . adding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : masslossrate ] ) the basic results for optically thick winds eq .",
    "( [ eq : vel - inf ] ) ( @xcite ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsteff ] ) ( @xcite ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : bstcolour ] ) ( @xcite ) , we are left with one free universal dimensionless function @xmath191 .",
    "it was shown that @xmath191 depends primarily on the geometrical characteristics of the inhomogeneous atmosphere from which the wind emerges . having no detailed information on the geometrical properties , we _ assumed",
    "_ that they are independent of @xmath31 , so that @xmath191 becomes a constant .    to check these ideas , we analyze 2 novae as well as the massive star @xmath0 carinae for which sufficiently detailed and accurate data is available .",
    "although the two types of systems are notably different , as they have masses , luminosities and mass loss rates which differ by orders of magnitude , the wind mass loss and the wind parameter are found to be in agreement with the theoretical expectation : = ( -1 ) ,  with   = 10.0 5 .",
    "the evolution of the temperature predicted from the luminosity agrees well with the temperature measured directly in the two novae .",
    "another interesting agreement is the consistency with clumping .",
    "clumping in sews is a natural prediction since the atmospheric layers beneath the sonic point are predicted to be inhomogeneous . moreover , clumpiness is a necessary ingredient in the present theory that allows super - eddington luminosities .",
    "the present theory predicts therefore , that sews are clumpy . in the analysis of ,",
    "the wind parameter obtained is coupled to the clumpiness of the wind since a clumpy wind with the same observed colour temperature will have a lower inferred mass loss .",
    "the lower @xmath212 reduces the measured wind parameter towards that obtained for  when the typical clumpiness factors seen in wr winds are taken into account .",
    "the consistency of all the results is best demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : w ] which shows that @xmath191 obtained from the three different objects is consistent with one another .",
    "although @xmath191 obtained is somewhat larger than the theoretical prediction using nominal values for the geometrical characteristics , the uncertainties in the latter are large enough to comfortably accommodate the range of ` measured ' @xmath191 s .",
    "an additional way of viewing the results is as follows .",
    "the sew theory predicts a range of @xmath191 which due to uncertainties can span at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the analysis of  yields a @xmath191 which agrees with this range .",
    "the analysis of  yields a @xmath191 which too agrees with this range if clumpiness , which is predicted , is included .",
    "next , instead of finding the values of @xmath191 which best fit @xmath0 car , we could have asked the opposite question . using the sew theory which was ` normalized ' using",
    ", we could have calculated what the observed mass loss should have been according to the sew theory , and find out that its prediction is completely consistent with the observed mass loss , even though the object s characteristics are different from novae by several of orders of magnitude .",
    "we also identify the occurrence of the ` transition phase ' observed in more than two thirds of the novae with the advance of the atmosphere into the ` no steady state region ' .",
    "as the nova explosion progresses , its luminosity and radius decline . however , if the radius decreases too quickly , at some point the predicted sew will be too heavy for the luminosity at the base to push mass to infinity .",
    "no steady state will then exist .",
    "the inconsistency might explain the strange behaviours observed in the transition phase of different novae .",
    "the wind model presented is by no means a complete theory for novae since it can not predict _ ab initio _ the luminosity at the base of the wind . to obtain the latter",
    ", one needs to solve for the complete evolution of a nova taking into account the fact that the nova s atmosphere becomes porous and feels a reduced effective opacity .",
    "one expects that the lowered opacity increases the luminosity obtained in the core - mass luminosity relation , and super - eddington values therefore arise naturally .",
    "preliminary numerical solution of the stellar structure equations appear to confirm this prediction .    in order to fully understand the behaviour of the atmosphere that drives these winds , a 2d or even 3d numerical simulations on scales of the order of few optical depths are unavoidable because of the intrinsic nonlinear properties of the problem .",
    "these simulations are underway and will allow one to study in detail the physics controlling the mass outflow .",
