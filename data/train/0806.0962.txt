    "several spectral / timing states are identified which are thought to arise from qualitatively different inner flow configurations . in the case of atoll sources ,",
    "the main three states are the extreme island state ( eis ) , the island state ( is ) and the banana branch , the latter subdivided into lower - left banana ( llb ) , lower banana ( lb ) and upper banana ( ub ) states .",

    "@xcite , using observations with rxte , discovered two simultaneous quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) near 900  hz and 1176  hz when the source was in the banana state .",
    "the frequency difference @xmath9 between the two khz qpo peaks is nearly equal to half the burst oscillation frequency , similar to what has been observed in other sources with burst oscillations or pulsation frequency @xmath10  hz . to the extent that this implies @xmath11 , this is inconsistent with spin - orbit beat - frequency models @xcite for the khz qpos such as proposed by @xcite .",

    "generally , @xmath9 decreases as the khz qpo frequency increases , and in 4u  163653 , observations have shown @xmath9 at frequencies lower as well as higher than half the burst oscillation frequency @xcite .    @xcite compared the timing properties of 4u  0614 + 09 , 4u  160852 and 4u  172834 and conclude that the frequencies of the variability components in these sources follow the same pattern of correlations .",

    "@xcite discovered a third khz qpo in 4u  160852 , 4u  172834 , and 4u  163653 which is likely an upper sideband to the lower khz qpo .",
    "recently , @xcite found in 4u  163653 an additional ( fourth ) khz qpo , likely the corresponding lower sideband .    in this paper , we present new results for low frequency noise with characteristic frequencies @xmath12  hz and qpos in the range @xmath13 hz , for the first time including rxte observations of the island state of this source . these results better constrain the timing behavior in the various states of 4u  163653 .",
    "we compare our results mainly with those of the atoll sources 4u  0614 + 09 , 4u  160852 and 4u  172834 and find that the frequency of the hectohertz component may not be constant as previously stated , but may have a sinusoidal like modulation within its range from @xmath8 to @xmath14  hz .",
    "our results also suggest that the mechanism that sets the frequency of the hhz qpos differs from that for the other components , while the amplitude setting mechanism is common .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that it is not possible to clearly distinguish between two harmonics of the low - frequency qpo @xmath15 across different sources , as was previously thought @xcite .",

    "the square root of the integrated power density equals the variance of the intrinsic variability in the source count rate . in order to improve the statistics",
    ", observations were averaged together if they described the same source state . since it is known from previous work on similar sources that the position of the source in the color - color diagram generally is well correlated to its spectral / timing state ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references within ) , we first grouped observations with similar colors . within each group , we then compared the shape of each average power spectrum with all of the other ones to create subgroups in which all power spectra had a dependence of power on frequency that was identical within errors .",

    "however , we also found some differences between 4u  163653 and other atoll sources which we discuss below .",
    "as 4u  163653 is one of the most luminous atoll sources showing the full complement of island and banana states ( full atoll track ) , the object is of interest in order to investigate the luminosity dependence of spectral / timing state behavior .",
    "this is of particular importance to the ongoing effort to understand the origin of the difference between the atoll sources and the more luminous z sources ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this unusual , somewhat erratic behavior of @xmath49 may be related to the fact that it is usually detected as a relatively weak wing to a much stronger @xmath48 , so that small deviations in the time - averaged shape of @xmath48 have a large effect on @xmath49 .    in order to investigate the relation of @xmath49 to the well - known low frequency noise ( lfn )",

    ", we find that the behavior of the lfn component of gx  17 + 2 , and that of @xmath49 of 4u  163653 are similar , which might indicate that the physical mechanism involved is the same . perhaps this is related to the fact that 4u  163653 is a relatively luminous atoll source ( see * ? ? ? * ) while gx 17 + 2 may be a relatively low luminosity z - source @xcite .",
    "hence , 4u  163653 might be relatively close in @xmath0 to gx  17 + 2 and differ more in @xmath0 from the other two sources introduced above .",
    "note that the time variability of gx  17 + 2 is different from that of the other z sources plotted in figure  [ fig : b2z ] .",
    "for instance , the characteristic frequency of its lfn is rather low and it appears as a peak , it shows a flaring branch oscillation ( fbo ) and the harmonic of the hbo is relatively strong , whereas the other z sources plotted show a flat lfn , no fbo and a weak harmonic to the hbo @xcite .",
    "as previously noted by @xcite , these properties set gx  17 + 2 apart from the cyg - like z sources gx  51 , gx  340 + 0 and cyg  x-2 and , associate it with the sco - like z sources sco  x-1 and gx  349 + 2 , not plotted in figure [ fig : b2z ] because no systematic study of the of the lfn and qpo behavior of these sources in terms of @xmath52 is available as yet .",
    "we further investigated the frequency similarities between 4u  163653 and gx  17 + 2 by plotting our results for the two sources .",
    "no clear component associations were found .",
    "gx  17 + 2 is the only z source that had shown an anti - correlation between the frequency of one of its components ( hbo ) and the khz qpos at high @xmath53  hz @xcite .",
    "a similar effect was seen in the atoll source 4u  0614 + 09 between @xmath36 and @xmath50 @xcite . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : nuvsnu ] ,",
    "a similar decrease of @xmath36 with @xmath50 at high frequency may occur in 4u  163653 .",
    "however , the error bars on @xmath36 are rather large in the relevant range , and the data are still consistent with @xmath36 being constant at @xmath54  hz , and marginally , even with a further increase in frequency .",
    "it is interesting to note , that while 4u  0614 + 09 has a much lower @xmath0 than 4u  163653 , both sources might show this same turnover in @xmath36 versus @xmath50 .",
    "of course , these results need confirmation .      with respect to the low - frequency qpo @xmath15",
    ", @xcite observed that in their data there were two groups of sources , one where the @xmath15 feature was visible , and a second one , were a qpo was detected which they suggested to be the sub - harmonic of @xmath15 and therefore , called @xmath55 .",
    "following @xcite , the upper continuous line in figure  [ fig : bumps ] indicates a power law fitted to the @xmath56 versus @xmath37 relation of the low luminosity bursters 1e  17243045 and gs  182624 , and the bhc gx  3394 .",
    "if we reproduce the fit where we take into account the errors in both axes , we find a best fit power - law index @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "if we fix @xmath59 , the fit gives a @xmath60 . according to the f - test for additional terms",

    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : bumps ] , in 4u  163653 the @xmath15 component does not follow either of the two power - law fits . if we fit the points for 4u  163653 , we find that the power - law index is @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , significantly different from that of the other sources .",

    "this conclusion is supported by the work of @xcite who also found a different correlation ( @xmath67 , see also figure  [ fig : bumps ] ) in xte  1807294 over a much wider range of frequencies than we obtained for 4u  163653 , by the high @xmath68 for the @xmath69 fit on the data of the low luminosity bursters 1e  17243045 , gs  182624 , and the bhc gx  3394 ( see previous paragraph ) , by the fact that if we use the centroid frequencies instead of @xmath52 , the relations worsen ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we note that all the @xmath56 values discussed here could in principle have been affected by smearing in the averaging process discussed in section  [ sec : dataanalysis ] .",
    "however , for smearing to shift a frequency - frequency point away from its proper value , large systematic differences are required between the two components in the dependence of amplitude or q on frequency , and in the case of @xmath15 and @xmath70 there is no evidence for this .    from figure",
    "[ fig : bumps ] it is apparent that the frequency range in which the @xmath15 component has been identified is rather large ( up to 2.5 decades ) .",

    "this work was supported by the `` nederlandse onderzoekschool voor astronomie '' ( nova ) , i.e. , the `` netherlands research school for astronomy '' , and it has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .        in the ideal case , we would have data with enough statistics to be able to follow the evolution of the parameters of all observable components in the power spectra on sufficiently short time scales to be sensitive to the smallest meaningful variations .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case for the present data and meaningful variations are averaged out in our data .",
    "these variations can sometimes be recovered by the use of alternative methods .",
    "for example , with the `` shift and add '' method introduced by @xcite , it has been possible to better constrain some of the characteristics of the khz qpos in several sources than without this method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a disadvantage of the method is that it distorts the power spectrum at the lowest and highest frequencies covered .",
    "we investigated if this method could also be used for our purpose .",
    "however , in our experiments with this we encountered several complications . from the observational point of view",
    ", in order to use this method we require a sharp power spectral feature that can be accurately traced in time .",
    "there are two possibilities for such features : the lower khz qpo @xmath38 and the low - frequency lorentzian @xmath15 .",
    "while the lower khz qpo is usually superimposed on well - modeled poisson noise , tracing @xmath15 is complicated by the fact that it is superimposed on strong variable broad band noise ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "more importantly , while @xmath38 can be traced on sufficiently short time scales ( @xmath112sec ) for the intrinsic changes in the characteristics of the power spectrum to be minimal , typically an entire observation is required for detecting @xmath15 at sufficient signal to noise . in practice",
    "this means that we can only use the shift and add method with @xmath38 , which constrains us to only that relatively limited part of the data where @xmath38 is actually detected ( see figure  [ fig : nuvsnu ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath15 and @xmath38 are not simultaneously detected in our data set .",
    "we analyzed all the datasets described in section  [ sec : dataanalysis ] and found that @xmath113% ( @xmath114  msec ) of our data have traceable lower khz qpos .",
    "most of that time the lower khz qpos are detected at frequencies between 700 and 850 hz ( the full range was 600900  hz ) .    in order to use the shift and add method we must adopt a relation between the frequency of the component we wish to shift on ( here the lower khz qpo ) and the frequency of the component we wish to detect ( here the low frequency qpos / noise ) .",
    "for example , in their original work @xcite supposed that the difference between the lower and the upper khz qpo frequency remained constant when both peaks move .",
    "the study of the characteristics of the low frequency qpos / noise using the shift and add method is complicated by the fact that we have imprecise information about their relation with the lower khz qpos : a constant frequency difference certainly does not apply even to narrow ranges in shift frequency .",
    "the aim of this paper as well as the aim of the papers cited below is to present observational results that help constrain those relations .",
    "as @xcite showed , the frequencies of all components except those of the hhz qpos are correlated in a similar way between sources ( see figure  [ fig : nuvsnu ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite also showed that those correlations are shifted in pulsating sources and @xcite found that even non - pulsating systems might show frequency shifts .",
    "additionally , the results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite show that although the frequency relations between the different components are well fitted with a power law , the index and normalization of the power law are different for each relation and may also depend on frequency range .    in order to quantify the problem described above , we studied observation 60032 - 01 - 05 - 00 using power spectra of 64-sec data segments at 2  hz frequency resolution .",
    "this is a very good observation for our purpose since : ( i ) it has @xmath115  ksec of uninterrupted data ; ( ii ) the lower khz qpo is strong enough to be significantly detected within 64 seconds for the entire 27  ksec ; ( iii ) the lower khz qpo frequency drifts between @xmath116 and @xmath117  hz and ( iv ) the power spectrum can be fitted with 4 lorentzians : 2 for the khz qpos , one for @xmath48 ( at @xmath118  hz ) and one for @xmath49 ( at @xmath119  hz ; @xmath120 ) .",
    "we first analyzed the power spectrum obtained by aligning the @xmath38 components .",
    "we found that @xmath48 and @xmath49 had blended into a broad component at @xmath8  hz .",
    "this result was expected , as a drift of 160  hz in @xmath121 does not imply a drift of the same magnitude in the frequencies of the low @xmath122 components .",
    "we then tried to align the power spectra by predicting the position of the low - frequency components from @xmath121 using a different power law relation for each component as reported by @xcite for @xmath48 and @xmath123 for @xmath49 ( the relation for @xmath49 is based on our data for 4u  163653 ; given the large errors in our data , the @xmath68 for the power law fit was 0.26 ) .",
    "the results depended on which power law we used : no significant changes in the resulting power spectrum were found when trying to align @xmath49 , while the power of both components was smeared out producing a blend when we tried to align @xmath48 .",
    "this was clearly the effect of the difference in power law indices and normalizations between components .",
    "as the frequency relations we used are between @xmath50 and the frequencies of the other components , we had to assume a relation between @xmath121 and @xmath50 in order to predict the frequency variations .",
    "we variously assumed @xmath124  hz and obtained similar results in each case .",
    "we also predicted @xmath9 by fitting a line to the @xmath9 vs. @xmath121 data reported by @xcite in the range @xmath125  hz .",
    "again , the results of the power - spectral fits were the same within errors as those of the previous experiments .",
    "we repeated the last exercise ( using the power law relations ) also for all 0.17  msec of @xmath121 useful data and for @xmath49 , @xmath48 and @xmath47 ( we use the power law relation as reported by @xcite for @xmath47 ) .",
    "we again found that our results were dependent on the power law used and not significantly better defined than the average power spectra obtained when all 0.17  msec of data were averaged together without shift . in another experiment we calculated 4 average power spectra including all 0.17  msec of useful data by selecting only those 64-second segments which had @xmath121 between 650700 , 700750 , 750800 , and 800850  hz respectively , and averaging these selected power spectra without shifting . in all cases we detect both khz qpos , a power law vlfn and @xmath48 .",
    "as expected from the results shown in figure  [ fig : nuvsnu ] , @xmath36 is correlated with the frequency of both khz qpos .",
    "the measured frequencies are all consistent within errors with those reported on figure  [ fig : nuvsnu ] and table  [ table : data ] .",
    "the lack of statistics in each average power spectrum did not allow us to well constrain the power spectral parameters of other components . finally , we fitted a line to the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath63 defined by the 4-points visible in figure  [ fig : bumps ] .",
    "we used the @xmath56 we find in all four power spectra ( a1 , b , d and e ) to predict @xmath37 and shift and add these four power spectra together .",
    "again , we find that the blend of components ( this time between @xmath48 and @xmath47 ) and the distortion of the power spectra at low frequencies prevented us to better estimate the @xmath47 parameters .",
    "so , neither the shift and add method nor selecting data on @xmath121 in 64-sec segments ( i.e. much shorter than an observation ) in our data provides an advantage in measuring the broad low frequency components better .",
    "therefore , in this paper we decided to the straightforward method described in section  [ sec : dataanalysis ] .",
