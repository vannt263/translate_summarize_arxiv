    "we subsequently apply a functional renormalization - group ( rg ) technique to analyze the interfacial singularities along the zero isotherm , as well as approaching the quantum phase transition from the finite temperature region , and characterize the surface quantum critical regime .",
    "we assume that the underlying microscopic interactions are short - ranged and the bulk phase transition can be described by an effective bosonic @xmath4-dimensional field theory characterized by a ( bulk ) dynamical exponent @xmath5",

    "the generic bulk phase diagrams of the systems in question are schematically depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the transition can be tuned by varying a non - thermal control parameter @xmath6 , or the temperature @xmath7 . at @xmath1",
    "there is a quantum phase transition of second ( a ) or first ( b ) order . in the latter case",

    "an interface unbinding transition must occur at the wall before the bulk critical temperature is reached .",

    "let us also note that the cahn argument breaks down in a number of physically interesting cases involving long - ranged microscopic interactions.@xcite however the quantum systems we address here either interact via short - ranged forces ( static spins ) or display efficient screening mechanisms ( itinerant fermions ) .",

    "this yields the bulk dynamical exponent @xmath46.@xcite for such cases , in the present study , we shall assume that the damping term in the effective action is inherited from the bulk order - parameter theory .",
    "we shall therefore neglect the possibility that _ direct _ coupling of the fluctuating interface to the soft particle - hole excitations across the fermi surface changes the way in which the imaginary time occurs in the effective action . for such cases we shall focus on @xmath47 pertinent to itinerant fermi systems ordering at wavevector @xmath48 , which may apply either to charge- or spin - density - waves .",

    "we have analyzed interfacial phenomena occurring in presence of bulk quantum phase transitions . applying a reasoning adapted from the theory of classical interfacial phase transitions",
    "we have argued that interfacial unbinding transitions generically accompany quantum critical phenomena .",
    "notably , the boundary transitions may occur ( and be of second order ) even if the bulk transitions are discontinuous .",
    "an interface unbinding transition implies a divergent interfacial length scale in a portion of the phase diagram within the bulk - ordered regime .",
    "this in turn gives rise to two scaling regimes in a region where the bulk is ordered but the interface is bound .",
    "we have found that , unlike the case of bulk transitions , the interfacial transition line in the ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) plane is not shifted by fluctuations , and ( for the case of a continuous transition in the bulk ) is determined by the shape of the bulk @xmath0-line .",
    "relying on a quantum version of an effective interfacial hamiltonian , we have computed the crossover between the quantum ( @xmath1 ) and the quantum - critical interfacial regimes .",
    "our result for the shape of the crossover line should be valid in arbitrary dimensionality @xmath2 . the critical behavior in the quantum regime is purely mean - field for @xmath247 , as anticipated from quantum to classical mapping arguments . so is the system s behavior in the interfacial quantum - critical regime for @xmath141 .",
    "our calculations in the quantum critical regime are reliable only for @xmath3 . in the @xmath17 case",
    "the interfacial correlation length diverges with a temperature dependent critical exponent , where the temperature - dependent part asymptotically vanishes .",
    "this feature is closely related to the nonuniversality of the classical critical wetting in @xmath17 .",
    "the crossover between the two interfacial scaling regimes is rather weak and in fact detectable only via the temperature - dependence of the interfacial correlation length exponent @xmath167 .",
    "in addition to the interfacial correlation length , we have computed the critical behavior of the average interfacial width , and found logarithmic singularities in both scaling regimes .",
    "we anticipate that the crossover between the two regimes is much more pronounced for @xmath238 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath42 and @xmath45 the system at @xmath1 may be in the same universality class as classical wetting in @xmath17 yielding a very reach spectrum of possible critical behavior .",
    "on the other hand , the classical interface unbinding transition in @xmath42 is governed by non - mean - field universal exponents .",
    "the properties of the quantum - critical regime in @xmath42 is an interesting problem , beyond the reach of the analytical linearized functional rg methodology , but open to be addressed within a numerical approach in near future .",
