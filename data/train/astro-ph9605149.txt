    "observations of radio and x  ray pulsars indicate , that the surface magnetic field of neutron stars can be as high as @xmath0 g .",
    "the strength of the internal magnetic field of neutron stars is unknown ; it could be much higher than that of the surface one .",
    "standard present day models of magnetic field identify its source with long  lived electric currents flowing in highly conductive neutron star matter . however , a complete scheme , based on such a model , which would explain both the origin and the evolution of neutron star magnetic field , is still lacking ( recent review on the present status of this topic can be found in bhattacharya & srinivasan 1995 ) .    a very different type of model of neutron star magnetic field is based on the hypothesis of existence of a ferromagnetic core in the liquid interior of neutron star .",
    "first models of this type were proposed just after the discovery of pulsars ( brownell & callaway 1969 , rice 1969 , silverstein 1969 ) .",
    "neutron star matter , approximated by a pure neutron matter , was assumed to undergo a transition to a ferromagnetic state above some critical density .",
    "ferromagnetic neutron matter , carrying high magnetization density , was there a permanent source of a superstrong magnetic field .",
    "this field , which would permeate stellar interior , was expected to extend outside the stellar surface as an observable ( mostly dipole ) magnetic field of a pulsar .",
    "the qualitative argument in favor of a ferromagnetic transition in sufficiently dense neutron matter was based on pauli exclusion principle , combined with the repulsive character of the short range @xmath1 interaction . at high density , the spin singlet ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 interaction becomes strongly repulsive , while the @xmath4 one , due to pauli principle , avoids the most repulsive , shortest range contribution from the @xmath5 state ( only odd @xmath6 states are allowed in the @xmath4 channel ) .",
    "so , although in the ferromagnetic transition the kinetic energy of the system increases , at sufficiently high density this was believed to be more than balanced by the removal of the repulsive interactions in the @xmath2 states ( because of complete spin polarization , all neutron pairs in a ferromagnetic phase are in the spin triplet state ) .",
    "the argument seemed to be particularly convincing for the schematic @xmath3 interaction of the infinite hard - core type ( hard spheres gas ) .",
    "some early calculations , based on the schematic models of the @xmath3 interaction , seemed to show the existence of spontaneous spin polarization in dense neutron matter above some critical density ( brownell & callaway 1969 , rice 1969 , silverstein 1969 , stgaard 1970 ; see , however , clark & chao 1969 , clark 1969 ) . however , further calculations , based on more realistic @xmath3 interactions and/or more precise methods of solution of the many body problem , ruled out possibility of ferromagnetism of dense neutron matter ( pandharipande et al . 1972 , haensel 1975 , modarres & irvine 1979 ) .",
    "such a possibility was ruled out even in the most favorable case of the hard - sphere model of neutron matter , where the contribution from the @xmath7 states was shown to be very important at superhigh densities ( dabrowski et al .",
    "1978 , 1979 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned , that in contrast to the realistic calculations described above , the calculations done within the hartree - fock approximation using schematic _ effective _ nucleon hamiltionian ( or lagrangian ) often showed a ferromagnetic transition in neutron matter at a few times nuclear matter density .",
    "vidaurre et al .",
    "( 1984 ) used non - relativistic effective @xmath3 interaction of the skyrme type , and found a ferromagnetic transition at about 1.5 times nuclear density .",
    "however , their result might be just a consequence of the specific density dependence of the spin dependent terms in the skyrme interaction , which in most cases leads to unphysical collapse ( no lower bound for the energy density ) of dense polarized neutron matter ( kutschera & wjcik 1994 ) .",
    "the spin stability of dense neutron matter was also studied within the relativistic dirac - hartree - fock approximation , with an effective nucleon - meson lagrangian , by marcos et al ( 1991 ) .",
    "these authors find a ferromagnetic transition at several times nuclear density , and point out that the presence of isovector mesons in the mean - field lagrangian is crucial for the possibility of ferromagnetic transition .",
    "let us notice , that the importance of vector meson - coupling for the ocurrence of ferromagnetism was pointed out some 20 years earlier ( kalman & lai 1971 ) . in general , it seems that the ferromagnetic transition in the mean - field theory models of dense neutron matter is a consequence of a very specific density dependence of the effective interactions characteristic of these models .    in all studies reviewed above ,",
    "neutron star matter was approximated by pure neutron matter .",
    "the importance of the presence of a small admixture of protons in neutron star matter for the spin stability was pointed out by kutschera and wjcik ( 1989 ) .",
    "they assumed that neutrons and protons in neutron star matter form normal fermi liquids .",
    "the ferromagnetic state , corresponding to completely polarized protons and weakly polarized neutrons , was shown to be energetically preferred over the non  polarized one in two cases : for sufficiently strong spin ",
    "spin component of the neutron ",
    "proton quasiparticle interaction and/or for localized protons .",
    "such conditions were shown to be satisfied for numerous models of the neutron star matter with low proton fraction .",
    "with their models of ferromagnetic cores in neutron stars , kutschera and wjcik were able to make specific predictions , concerning dependence of the strength of the surface magnetic field on the neutron star mass ( kutschera & wjcik 1992 ) .",
    "the calculations performed for strongly asymmetric nuclear matter within the relativistic dirac - hartree - fock approximation , using the mean field nucleon - meson lagrangian , confirmed that the presence of an admixture of protons favors the ferromagnetic instability of dense matter ( bernardos et al .",
    "1995 ) .    at the densities exceeding the critical density for the onset of ferromagnetism",
    ", the ground state of neutron star matter corresponds to a non - zero spin polarization .",
    "however , the direction of the _ local _ spin polarization could vary within the ferromagnetic core , which might have a domain structure .",
    "the macroscopic magnetization , relevant for the stellar magnetic field , may be expected to result from some volume averaging , and should be consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium of the star .",
    "we present in this paper a self  consistent calculation of the magnetic field of neutron star , produced by a liquid , ferromagnetic core .",
    "our calculations , which are done within the framework of general relativity , take into account constraints resulting from the requirement of the hydrostatic equilibrium , as well as from realistic boundary conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the microscopic model of nucleon ferromagnetism . a model of ferromagnetic neutron star core",
    "is described in section 3 .",
    "physical conditions within the neutron star interior , relevant for the properties of ferromagnetic neutron stars , are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the calculation of magnetic field of neutron star with a ferromagnetic core , performed in general relativity , is described in section 5 .",
    "numerical results , obtained using specific assumptions concerning physical conditions in neutron star interiors , are presented in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we confront our results with observations of radio pulsars .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 8 .",
    "the possibility of ferromagnetism of dense nucleon matter results from the existence of the spin  spin component of the quasiparticle nucleon  nucleon interaction .",
    "we consider the simplest model of neutron star matter , consisting of neutrons , protons and electrons . at given baryon density , @xmath8 ,",
    "the composition of matter can be characterized by the proton fraction @xmath9 , such that proton density @xmath10 , while neutron density @xmath11 .",
    "the degree of spin polarization of nucleons can be measured by the parameters @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number density of neutron quasiparticles with @xmath14 spin projection of the spin on the spin quantization axis , etc . in the normal ( i.e. , non  ferromagnetic ) state , the energy density reaches its minimum at @xmath15 .",
    "our discussion of the properties of the spin ",
    "polarized neutron star matter will follow the paper of kutschera and wjcik ( 1989 ) .",
    "we assume that nucleons are normal ( possible effects of nucleon superfluidity will be discussed in sections 4 , 6 ) .",
    "we neglect the thermal effects , and calculate all thermodynamic quantities at the @xmath16 approximation .",
    "the change in the nucleon contribution to the energy density , implied by a small spin polarization of nucleons , @xmath17 , can be calculated using the methods of the theory of fermi liquids , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fermi liquid parameters , describing the spin ",
    "spin terms in the qusiparticle nucleon  nucleon interaction in nucleon matter , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the densities of states at the corresponding fermi surfaces for neutrons and protons , respectively . while first and and second terms on the r.h.s",
    ". of eq.([eq : epol ] ) are positive ( @xmath24 ) , the last term can be always made negative , irrespectively of the sign of the @xmath21 parameter .",
    "notice , that the third term , which results from the spin ",
    "spin interaction between neutron and proton quasiparticles , vanishes for a non  interacting system .    if @xmath25 , the system is unstable with respect to spin polarization . for small proton fraction ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "the approximate expression for @xmath27 reads ( kutschera & wjcik 1989 , hereafter referred to as kw89 ) @xmath28 spontaneous spin polarization takes place for sufficiently strong @xmath21 .",
    "the approximate condition for nucleon ferromagnetism reads thus @xmath29 if condition ( [ eq : ferro ] ) is satisfied , the ground state of matter contains then completely polarized protons ( @xmath30 ) , and weakly polarized neutrons , @xmath31 the values of the fermi liquid parameters in strongly asymmetric nuclear matter , as well as their density dependence , are very uncertain .",
    "it seems to be reasonable to say , that their present knowledge does not exclude the situation , in which equation ( [ eq : ferro ] ) is satisfied above some critical density @xmath32 .    for sufficiently low proton fraction ( such that protons can be considered as impurities in neutron matter )",
    ", the ground state of nucleon matter could correspond to a non - uniform distribution of neutrons , with proton localized ( bound ) in the neutron density minima ( kutschera & wjcik 1990 ) . in the case of localized protons , the whole second term on the r.h.s . of eq.([eq : epol ] ) vanishes , and nucleon matter is always unstable with respect to full polarization of protons ( kw89 ) .",
    "such a case corresponds most probably to the solid ferromagnetic core ( kutschera & wjcik 1995 ) .",
    "it should be stressed , that the results described above can be directly used in the neutron star calculations only under a rather unrealistic assumption of perfect space homogeneity of a macroscopic element of matter .",
    "only in such an idealized case ( which was actually assumed in kutschera & w ' ojcik 1992 ) the ` microscopic ' and ` macroscopic ' magnetizations will coincide .",
    "it seems to be quite realistic to assume , that the ferromagnetic phase of dense matter has some ` domain structure ' . in such a case",
    ", microscopic results would be valid only within a single domain .",
    "the macroscopic values , relevant for the stellar structure , would then correspond to an average over a sufficiently large number of domains . to be more precise , the macroscopic value of a quantity is then defined as an average over volume element , which contains a sufficient number of domains , so that the calculated value does not depend on the specific averaging procedure",
    ". of course , the element should be still small on the stellar scale , so that the macroscopic value has a local character .",
    "the macroscopic quantities would have to be consistent with our assumption about the axial symmetry of the star .",
    "it is well known , that ferromagnetism is an example of a second - order phase transition , and can be treated within the general scheme of the theory of second - order phase transitions , formulated by landau ( see , e.g. , section 39 of landau et al .",
    "1984 ) . however , landau theory of second - order phase transitions asumes expansion of @xmath33 ( or other suitable thermodynamic potential ) up to fourth order in polarization parameter .",
    "approximate expression for @xmath27 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : epol ] ) , is truncated at terms quadratic in polarization parameters .",
    "such an approximation is characteristic of the fermi liquid theory , in which only terms quadratic in deviations from the normal , reference state , are conserved .",
    "therefore , the model proposed in kw89 , if taken literally , can not predict the threshold behavior @xmath34 for @xmath35 , characteristic of a general case of spontaneous polarization in ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the case of ferromagnetism with localized protons deserves a special comment .",
    "the threshold density for proton localization , @xmath36 , corresponds to a phase transition from a liquid mixture of protons , neutron and electrons to a proton crystal immersed in a neutron and electron liquid .",
    "such a liquid - solid phase transitions is expected to be the first - order one ( i.e. , accompanied by the density and order parameter discontinuity ) .",
    "however , for normal neutrons , localization implies complete proton polarization , so that @xmath37 .",
    "in such a case , even for @xmath38 protons remain fully polarized .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that magnetization of the ferromagnetic core represents the only source of stellar magnetic field ( i.e. , we neglect contribution to magnetic field resulting from electric currents ) .    we consider a simple model for the magnetization density of polarized matter , @xmath39 , within the ferromagnetic core ( @xmath40 ) , as a function of baryon density , @xmath8 . in general , the spin contribution to the z - component of @xmath39 in the ferromagnetic phase is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 are intrinsic magnetic moments of protons and neutrons , respectively , and we assumed that z - axis is the spin quantization axis .",
    "we modeled @xmath44 by a simple expression @xmath45 where @xmath46 corresponds to perfectly ordered ferromagnetic state , considered by kutschera & wjcik ( 1992 , hereafter referred to as kw92 ) , and dimensionless factor @xmath47 describes the degree of macroscopic polarization ( degree of ordering of ferromagnetic domains ) .",
    "our formula for @xmath39 , eq.([eq : mz_alpha ] ) , takes thus into account a possibility of partial macroscopic ordering of nucleon spins ( partial ordering of ferromagnetic domains ) , including the case of vanishing macroscopic magnetization within the ferromagnetic core ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "macroscopic magnetization density @xmath39 is the source of magnetic field within ferromagnetic neutron star cores . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of non - vanishing @xmath39 modifies the energy density , due to coupling to magnetic field .",
    "consistent derivation of this coupling from microscopic theory shows , that the additional term to be included is @xmath49 ( de groot & suttorp 1972 , chapter x ; carter 1982 ) . if we take the @xmath50-axis along @xmath51 , then minimization of energy requires @xmath52 .",
    "the consequences of this condition will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "in what follows , we consider the interior of neutron star , of density @xmath53 . with our assumptions ,",
    "this interior consists of a ferromagnetic core of the density @xmath40 , and a non ",
    "ferromagnetic liquid envelope of the density @xmath54 .",
    "neutron stars are believed to be born as very hot objects , with initial internal temperatures above @xmath55  k. young neutron star cools via neutrino emission .",
    "initial temperature of neutron star core can be expected to be larger than , or of the order of , the curie temperature for the ferromagnetic transition , @xmath56  k ( haensel 1995 , unpublished ) .",
    "another important critical temperature is that for nucleon superfluidity , @xmath57  k. it is thus reasonable to expect , that the nucleon ferromagnetic transition occurs before superfluidity sets in , i.e. , that ferromagnetism takes place in normal fermi liquids . because @xmath58 , completely polarized proton component can not undergo singlet pairing at @xmath59 .",
    "also , a fraction of polarized neutrons remains in the normal state , due to their coupling to completely polarized protons .",
    "in such a way , protons , and a small fraction ( a few percent ) of neutrons may be expected to be locked in a polarized state , due to energy barrier against the depolarization of the ferromagnetic component .",
    "it should be stressed , that in view of the uncertainties in the many body theory of dense matter at supranuclear density , even the very existence of proton superconductivity can not be considered as absolutely certain . in view of this",
    ", we may contemplate several possibilities .",
    "in the first case , considered by kw92 , ferromagnetic core is surrounded by a liquid envelope of normal matter with @xmath54 , containing normal ( i.e. , non  superconducting ) protons . in the second case ,",
    "liquid envelope is assumed to contain superconducting protons .",
    "the superconductivity of the envelope could strongly influence magnetic properties of ferromagnetic neutron star ( see section 5 , 6 ) .",
    "the calculation of the stellar magnetic field has been done neglecting sources other than magnetization of matter within the ferromagnetic core .",
    "we took into account space curvature , implied by the neutron star gravity .    the first stage consisted in the calculation of the configuration of hydrostatic equilibrium for a non - rotating neutron star with a ferromagnetic core . in this calculation , we neglected the influence of the presence of magnetic field on the equation of state of the matter ; this approximation will be justified quantitatively in section 6 .",
    "the magnetic field vectors @xmath60 , @xmath61 were calculated by solving the equations of magnetostatics in curved space .",
    "these equations are deduced from the maxwell equations in the curved space in the static case ( see , e.g. , eqs .",

    "0.5 cm in the ferromagnetic model of kutschera and wjcik ( 1992 ) , consistency of the obtained values of surface magnetic field with pulsar timing was obtained via cancellations of the contributions to the stellar dipole magnetic moment coming from the inner and outer regions of the ferromagnetic cores . in particular ,",
    "the low values of @xmath178 for millisecond pulsars were explained by assuming that the magnetic moment of their ferromagnetic cores was some three orders of magnitude smaller than that of ordinary pulsars . according to kutschera and wjcik ( 1992 ) ,",
    "such a situation was made possible due to the cancellations , resulting from the change of sign within the ferromagnetic core .",
    "this was possible only within a very narrow interval of neutron star masses ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "consistent calculations of the magnetic field produced by the ferromagnetic core of neutron star , performed in the present paper , show that the projection of the macroscopic magnetization onto the symmetry axis can not change sign within the core . in view of this",
    ", consistency with pulsar timing can be achieved only under some specific conditions .",
    "if the liquid envelope surrounding ferromagnetic core is non - superconducting , than the ferromagnetic phase has to be highly disordered , with the degree of macroscopic polarization varying from @xmath180 for young pulsars , to @xmath181 for the millisecond pulsars . in the case , when the liquid envelope is a type - i superconductor , the ferromagnetic core produces no external magnetic field , which could be then produced exclusively by the currents within the neutron star crust .",
    "recently , kotlorz & kutschera ( 1994 ) pointed out an interesting possibility of existence of ferromagnetic pion - condensed quark cores , within sufficiently massive neutron stars .",
    "their results imply @xmath182 .",
    "such huge values of @xmath151 can be reconcilied with pulsar timing only if either pion - condensed quark core has very low degree of macroscopic spin ordering , @xmath183 , or if this core is screened by the superconducting nucleon envelope .",
    "we express our deep gratitude to eric gourgoulhon for his helpful remarks concerning maxwell equations in the curved space , and for the careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we are also grateful to marek kutschera for pointing out the importance of relativistic effects .",
