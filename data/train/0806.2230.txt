    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the theory of the strong interactions .",
    "although qcd has proven remarkably successful , there is a blemish called the strong @xmath5 problem .",
    "the strong @xmath5 problem is that the effective lagrangian of qcd has @xmath5 violating term but it is not observed , i.e. , the experimental value of neutron electric dipole moment is smaller than expected by many orders of magnitude .",
    "peccei and quinn proposed an attractive solution to solve this problem @xcite .",
    "they introduced a new global @xmath6 symmetry , peccei ",
    "quinn ( pq ) symmetry .",
    "when pq symmetry is spontaneously broken , a new effective term arises in qcd lagrangian which cancels the @xmath5 violation term .",
    "the solution also predicts a new pseudo nambu ",
    "goldstone boson , axion . the expected behavior of an axion is characterized mostly by the scaling factor of the pq symmetry breaking , @xmath7 , and so its mass , @xmath4 , which is directly related to @xmath7 by @xmath8/f_a$ ] .",
    "axions are expected to be produced in stellar core through their coupling to photons with energies of order kev .",
    "especially , the sun can be a powerful source of axions and the so - called ` axion helioscope ' technique may enable us to detect such axions directly @xcite .",
    "the principle of the axion helioscope is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : principle ] .",
    "axions would be produced through the primakoff process in the solar core .",
    "the differential flux of solar axions at the earth is approximated by @xcite @xmath9    \\nonumber\\\\    & & { } \\times\\left({g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}}\\over10^{-10}\\mathrm{gev}^{-1}\\right)^2    \\left ( \\frac{e}{1\\,\\mathrm{kev}}\\right)^{2.481 }    \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{e}{1.205\\,\\mathrm{kev}}\\right ) ,    \\label{eq : aflux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the axion - photon coupling constant .",
    "their average energy is 4.2kev reflecting actually the core temperature of the sun(@xmath10 ) , since low energy axion production is suppressed due to screening effects@xcite .",
    "then , they would be coherently converted into x - rays through the inverse process in a strong magnetic field at a laboratory .",
    "the conversion rate is given by @xmath11 \\times \\int_{0}^{l}dz b_\\bot\\exp \\left[i \\int_{0}^{z } \\mathrm{d}z^{\\prime}\\left ( q - \\frac{i\\gamma}{2}\\right ) \\right]\\right|^2 ,    \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the coordinate along the incident solar axion , @xmath14 is the strength of the transverse magnetic field , @xmath15 is the length of the field along @xmath12-axis , @xmath16 is the x - ray absorption coefficient of helium , @xmath17 is the momentum transfer by the virtual photon , and @xmath18 is the effective mass of the photon which equals zero in vacuum .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) is reduced to @xmath19 ^ 2 ,    \\label{eq : prob_plain}\\ ] ] in case @xmath20 and @xmath14 is constant along @xmath12-axis and @xmath21 .    in 1997 , the first phase measurement @xcite was performed using an axion helioscope with a dedicated superconducting magnet which is identical to the one used in the present experiment , except that the gas container was absent and the conversion region was vacuum .",
    "its sensitivity was limited to the axion mass region of @xmath22 due to a loss of coherence by non - zero @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob_plain ] ) .",
    "if one can adjust @xmath18 to @xmath4 , coherence will be restored for non - zero mass axions .",
    "this is achieved by filling the conversion region with gas .",
    "a photon in the x - ray region acquires a positive effective mass in a medium . in light gas , such as hydrogen or helium ,",
    "it is well approximated by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fine structure constant , @xmath25 is the electron mass , and @xmath26 is the number density of electrons .",
    "we adopted cold helium gas as a dispersion - matching medium . here , light gas was preferred since it minimizes self absorption by gas .",
    "it is worth noting that helium remains at gas state even at 56k , the operating temperature of our magnet . since the bore of the magnet",
    "is limited in space , the easiest way is to keep the gas at the same temperature as the magnet .",
    "moreover , axions as heavy as a few electronvolts can be reached with helium gas of only about one atmosphere at this temperature .    in this way , in 2000 , the second phase measurement @xcite was performed to search for sub - electronvolt axions . this experiment , together with the first phase measurement of 1997 @xcite with vacuum conversion region , yielded an upper limit of @xmath27 ( 95% cl ) for @xmath28 .    in this letter",
    ", we will present the result of the third phase measurement in which we scanned the mass region between @xmath2 using the upgraded apparatus to withstand higher pressure gas .",
    "the schematic figure of the axion helioscope is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sumico ] .",
    "it is designed to track the sun in order to achieve long exposure time .",
    "it consists of a superconducting magnet , x - ray detectors , a gas container , and an altazimuth mounting . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we will describe each part in due order .",
    "the superconducting magnet @xcite consists of two 2.3-m long race - track shaped coils running parallel with a 20-mm wide gap between them .",
    "the magnetic field in the gap is 4 t perpendicular to the helioscope axis .",
    "the coils are kept at 56k during operation . in order to make it easy to swing this large cryogenic apparatus , two devices are engaged .",
    "first , the magnet was made cryogen - free by making two gifford - mcmahon refrigerators to cool it directly by conduction .",
    "second , a persistent current switch was equipped . thanks to this , the magnet can be freed from thick current leads after excitation , and the magnetic field is very stable for a long period of time without supplying current .",
    "the container to hold dispersion - matching gas is inserted in the @xmath29 aperture of the magnet .",
    "its body is made of four 2.3-m long 0.8-mm thick stainless - steel square pipes welded side by side to each other .",
    "the entire body is wrapped with 5n high purity aluminium sheet to achieve high uniformity of temperature .",
    "the measured thermal conductance between the both ends was @xmath30 at 6k .",
    "one end at the forward side of the container is sealed with welded plugs and is suspended firmly by three kevlar cords , so that thermal flow through this end is highly suppressed .",
    "combined thermal conductance of three kevlar cords is estimated to be smaller than that of the container itself by four orders of magnitude . since place - to - place temperature difference of the magnet is likely to be much less than 1k , the temperature of the container is calculated to be uniform along the length within the order of 0.1mk , which is fairly small and has only negligible effect on the coherence of the axion to photon conversion .",
    "radiative thermal flow between the gas container and the magnet is the same order of magnitude as the conductive flow through the kevlar cords , and hence negligible , too .",
    "the opposite side nearer to the x - ray detectors is flanged and fixed to the magnet . at this end of the container",
    ", gas is separated from vacuum with an x - ray window manufactured by metorex which is transparent to x - ray above 2kev and can hold gas up to 0.3mpa at liquid helium temperature .    to have automatic sequential pressure settings of the dispersion - matching gas for the scan of the axion mass region around 1ev ,",
    "a gas handling system is built with 3 piezo valves ( two horibastec pv1101 and a pv1302 ) and a precision pressure gauge ( yokogawa mu101-ah1n ) .",
    "the temperature of the gas container was measured by a lakeshore cgr thermistor .    required pressure for a given mass",
    "was determined by the corresponding gas density and the temperature based on interpolation of the tables from nist @xcite .",
    "the error of the target mass is estimated to be less than 5mev by the errors of the pressure and the temperature .",
    "since we are scanning a range of the axion mass , the error is only crucial to the lower and upper edges of the mass range .",
    "helium gas is fed to the container through the piezo valve to have a specified pressure setting .",
    "if a lower pressure setting is required , then another piezo valve is opened to suck the gas by a vacuum pump connected to the valve .",
    "once a proper pressure setting is settled , all the valves are closed and the helium gas is kept confined to have a constant electron number density in the container until the measurement for the setting is completed .",
    "the uniformity of the temperature guarantees the homogeneous density along the length of the container .",
    "the whole process is done step by step automatically to scan the axion mass .",
    "absorption of x - ray in the helium gas is not negligible and the effect is properly calculated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) .",
    "the electron number density might vary slightly along the container from the one end to the other because of the gravity when the inclination is high , and the coherence could be partly lost accordingly . the effect is also taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) .",
    "the decreases of the conversion probability @xmath31 due to the absorption and the gravity are less than 23% and 1% , respectively when @xmath18 is tuned to 1.0ev at the center of the gas container .    for emergency exhaust of the gas in case of rapid temperature increase due to a magnet quenching ,",
    "a rupture disk , which is designed to break at 0.248 mpa , is introduced into the gas handling system to avoid destruction of the x - ray window by the over pressure .",
    "sixteen pin photodiodes , hamamatsu photonics s3590 - 06-spl , are used as the x - ray detectors , whose chip sizes are @xmath32 each . in the present measurement , however ,",
    "twelve of them are used for the analysis because four went defective through thermal stresses since the measurement of the previous phase .",
    "the effective area of a photodiode was measured formerly using a pencil - beam x - ray source , and found to be larger than @xmath33 .",
    "it has an inactive surface layer of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "each chip is mounted on a kapton film bonded to an invar plate with cryogenic compatible adhesive .",
    "the x - ray detectors are mounted in a 10-mm thick radiation shielding box made of oxygen - free high conductivity copper ( ofhc cu ) , which is then surrounded by a lead shield of about 150 mm thick .",
    "the copper shield is operated at about 60k , so that it also functions as a cold finger for the x - ray detectors .",
    "details on the x - ray detector are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the output from each photodiode is fed to a charge sensitive preamplifier whose first - stage fet is at the cryogenic stage near the photodiode chip and the preamplifier outputs are digitized using camac flash analog - to - digital convertors ( fadcs ) , repic rpc-081 s , at a sampling rate of 10 mhz .",
    "the preamplifier outputs are also fed to shaping amplifiers , clear pulse cp4026 , whose outputs are then discriminated to generate triggers .",
    "thus , waveforms of the sixteen preamplifier outputs are recorded simultaneously over 50 @xmath35s before and after each trigger to be committed to later off - line analysis .",
    "each detector was calibrated by 5.9-kev mn x - rays from a source installed in front of them .",
    "the source is manipulated from the outside and is completely retracted behind the shield during the axion observations , i.e. during solar tracking .    the entire axion detector is constructed in a vacuum vessel and the vessel is mounted on an altazimuth mount .",
    "its trackable altitude ranges from @xmath36 to @xmath37 and its azimuthal direction is designed to be limited only by a limiter which prevents the helioscope from endless rotation .",
    "however , in the present measurement , the azimuthal range is restricted to about 60@xmath38 because a cable handling system for its unmanned operation is not completed yet .",
    "the range corresponds to an exposure time of about a quarter of a day in observing the sun .",
    "this is enough for the time being , since background is measured during the other three quarters of a day .",
    "when the entire cable handling system is complete , running time per pressure setting can be shortened by a factor of more than two .",
    "this helioscope mount is driven by two ac servo motors controlled by a computer ( pc ) .",
    "the pc also monitors the azimuthal and altitudinal directions of the helioscope regularly by two precision rotary encoders and forms a feedback controlling loop as a whole .",
    "the us naval observatory vector astronomy subroutines ( novas ) @xcite were used to calculate the solar position .",
    "the altitudinal origin was determined from a spirit level . while the sun is not directly visible from the laboratory in the basement floor , the azimuthal origin was first determined by a gyrocompass , which detects the north direction by the rotation of the earth within an error of @xmath39 , and then it was introduced to the laboratory with a theodolite .",
    "since the effective aperture of the helioscope is narrow , it is crucial to determine its accurate geometry .",
    "the axis of the helioscope is defined by two cross hairs at the edge of the vacuum vessel .",
    "the position of each part of the helioscope was measured relative to these cross hairs from their exterior using the theodolite when they were installed .",
    "the positions of the pin photodiodes were determined relative to the copper shielding box from a photo image taken prior to the installation .",
    "as it is hard to estimate analytically the effect of the geometrical errors as well as the effect of the size of the axion source , we performed a monte carlo simulation and found that the overall effective area is larger than @xmath40 at 99% confidence level .",
    "it is smaller than the nominal sum of the area of all the living pin diodes mainly because the line of sight is partly shaded by the walls of the four square pipes of the gas container from the axion source region of the sun .",
    "also included are many other small effects like geometrical misalignment of the container and the pin diodes , distortion of the square pipes , absorption by thick supporting grids of the x - ray window , and so on .",
    "from december 2007 through april 2008 , a measurement employing dispersion - matching gas was performed for 34 photon mass settings with about three days of running time per setting to scan around 1 ev , which is shown in table [ tab : settings ] .    before obtaining energy spectra ,",
    "each event was categorized into two major groups , the solar observation and the background .",
    "events while the measured direction agreed with the sun are counted as former . when the sun is completely out of the magnet aperture ,",
    "events are counted as latter . otherwise events are discarded .",
    "we performed numerical pulse shaping to the raw waveforms using the wiener filter .",
    "the energy of an x - ray is given by the peak height of a wave after the shaping .",
    "the shaped waveform is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are fourier transformations of the shaped waveform , the ideal signal waveform , the measured waveform , and the noise , respectively .",
    "noises are obtained by gathering waveforms while no trigger exists , and the ideal signal waveform is approximated by averaging signals from 5.9-kev x - rays .",
    "the response function of this waveform analysis , i.e. , non - linearity , gain walk by trigger timing , etc . , was investigated thoroughly using simulated pulses which were obtained by adding the template waveform to the noise waveforms .",
    "a correction was made based on this numerical simulation .",
    "saturation arose at about 25kev , therefore , @xmath46 was not used in the later analysis .",
    "event reduction process is applied in the same way as the second phase measurement @xcite in order to get rid of bad events like microphonics . applying the same cuts to the @xmath47fe source data",
    ", we found the loss of axion detection efficiency by the reduction to be less than 1.5% .",
    "the background level was about @xmath48 at @xmath49 . by analysing the calibration data , we found the energy resolution of each photodiode to be 0.81.2kev ( fwhm ) for 5.9-kev photons .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] , the energy spectrum of the solar observation with the gas density for @xmath50 is shown together with the background spectrum .",
    "we searched for expected axion signals which scale with @xmath51 for various @xmath4 in these spectra .",
    "the smooth curve in the figure represents an example for the expected axion signal where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which corresponds to the upper limit estimated as follows .",
    "a series of least @xmath54 fittings was performed assuming various @xmath4 values .",
    "data from the 34 different gas density settings were combined by using the summed @xmath54 of the 34 .",
    "the energy region of 420kev was used for fitting where the efficiency of the trigger system is almost 100% and the fadcs do not saturate . as a result",
    ", no significant excess was seen for any @xmath4 , and thus an upper limit on @xmath3 at 95% confidence level was given following the bayesian scheme .",
    "[ fig : exclusion ] shows the limit plotted as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "our previous limits from the first @xcite and the second @xcite phase measurements and some other bounds are also plotted in the same figure .",
    "the shown previous limits have been updated using newly measured inactive surface layer thickness of the pin photodiode  @xcite ; the difference is , however , marginal .",
    "the solax  @xcite , cosme  @xcite and dama  @xcite are solar axion experiments which exploit the coherent conversion(i.e .",
    "axion bragg scattering@xcite ) on the crystalline planes in a germanium and a nai detector .",
    "the experiment by lazarus  @xcite and cast  @xcite are the same kind of experiments as ours .",
    "the latter utilizes a large decommissioned magnet of the lhc at cern . its limit is better than our previous limits by a factor of seven in low @xmath4 region due to its larger @xmath55 and @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob_plain ] ) . in the region @xmath56",
    ", however , our previous and present limits surpass the limit of cast .",
    "the limit @xmath57 is the solar limit inferred from the solar age consideration and the limit @xmath58 is a more stringent limit reported by schlattl  @xcite based on comparison between the helioseismological sound - speed profile and the standard solar evolution models with energy losses by solar axions . watanabe and shibahashi @xcite have argued that the helioseismological bound can be lowered to @xmath59 if the ` seismic solar model ' and the observed solar neutrino flux are combined .",
    "the axion mass around 1ev has been scanned with an axion helioscope with cold helium gas as the dispersion - matching medium in the @xmath60 magnetic field , but no evidence for solar axions was seen .",
    "a new limit on @xmath3 shown in fig . [ fig : exclusion ] was set for @xmath2 .",
