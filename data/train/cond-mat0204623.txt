    "extended elastic manifolds pulled through a _ quenched _ random medium by an applied force @xmath0 exhibit , in the absence of thermal fluctuations , a sharp transition from a pinned phase to a moving phase as @xmath0 is increased through a critical value @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "examples include interfaces between two fluids in porous media @xcite or between oppositely magnetized ferromagnetic domains , vortex lines and lattices in type ii superconductors @xcite , @xcite , charge density waves @xcite , and planar crack fronts in solids @xcite .",
    "although the _ depinning _ transitions of interest are driven non - equilibrium transitions , it is instructive to draw an analogy with equilibrium phase transitions with the average velocity @xmath2 playing the role of an order parameter , @xmath0 a tuning parameter , and the quenched variations of the random potential loosely analogous  at least as giving rise to an ensemble  to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the character of depinning transitions can , one might expect , be either discontinuous transitions with hysteresis  loosely like first - order transitions  , or critical  analogous to second - order  transitions depending on the system and , perhaps , on its _ history _ ; such history dependence is an effect that can not occur in true equilibrium .",
    "theoretical analysis has shown that a broad class of realistic models undergo a _",
    "critical _ depinning transition with a unique , history independent critical force in the limit of a large system and @xmath3 for @xmath0 just above @xmath1 .",
    "several different universality classes have been studied , including both short and long - range interactions , and random forces with or without periodicity  the former arising for manifolds with a periodic structure in the direction in which they move @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but most of the theoretical analysis has focused on dissipative dynamics for which both inertia and any wave or other non - local stress propagation effects are ignored .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study some of the consequences of these and other effects which we shall generically refer to , for reasons to be explained shortly , as _ stress overshoot _ effects .    in order to understand the potential of these effects to significantly change the nature of depinning , it is necessary to consider the nature of the irregular local motion that underlies the critical depinning phenomena .",
    "the elasticity of the manifold mediates between two competing types of forces : the applied driving force and the random local pinning forces . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "the pinning dominates and the system relaxes to one of many static locally - stable configurations . but as the force is slowly increased , there will be local instabilities when the driving force exceeds the random pinning in some small region . a segment of the manifold",
    "will then move forward rapidly and there will be some transient motion , limited in spatial extent , until a new static configuration is reached . for large @xmath0 , in contrast , the applied force will dominate and the system will approach a nonequilibrium statistically steady state with a non - zero mean velocity .",
    "nevertheless , especially if the force is not too large , the motion on short length and time scales will be very irregular with instantaneous local velocities that far exceed the macroscopic average velocity @xmath4 .    in the absence of inertia or wave propagation",
    ", each segment of the manifold will move in response to the total force applied to it : from the applied drive , from the random pinning , and from the other segments via elasticity . as long as the applied force is non - decreasing in time , the motion ( at least after initial transients have decayed away ) will be only in the ",
    "forward \" direction in which the system is driven .",
    "this , combined with the convexity properties of elasticity , means that the static configuration the system will settle into after it is disturbed by an increase  global or local  in the applied force does not depend on the details of its dynamics .",
    "the motion can thus be considered as quasistatic , _ in spite of _ the rapid local motion that occurs .",
    "now consider what can happen in the presence of either inertia or elastic waves that carry stress from one region to another in response to motion of one segment .",
    "the local dynamics would then appear to be crucial : if the local motion is rapid enough that the relaxation to a new static configuration is underdamped , a moving segment can overshoot one or more potential static configurations before settling , if at all , in another . even if the inertia is small enough that such local prolonged jumps do not occur ,",
    "as long as the motion is sometimes underdamped , a segment can temporarily overshoot a static configuration before relaxing back into it ; this will produce a temporary overshoot of the stress  above its eventual static value  that this motion induces on neighboring segments .",
    "any arbitrary small overshoot in the stress has the potential to dislodge another segment if there is one nearby that was sufficiently close to being destabilized in the absence of the overshoot ; again , the effects of this will be to cause the system to skip through a potentially static configuration without stopping .",
    "elastic waves , just like their electrodynamic cousins , carry with them pulses in stress that are larger than the eventual static stress that will obtain long after the waves have passed by .",
    "these stress overshoots , like those from the inertia of local motion , have the potential to cause overjumping .",
    "very generally , overjumping of any kind means that which configuration a pinned manifold stops in depends on details of its local dynamics and on its history , in a way that can not occur in the absence of inertial effects .",
    "one particularly interesting consequence of this is the coexistence in two identical samples at the same value of the driving force of a static locally stable configuration , and a moving configuration that will  overtake \" the static configuration . what the _ macroscopic _ consequences of this are is the primary subject of this paper .",
    "as stress overshoots can occur more readily than local overjumps caused by inertia , we will generally refer to both types of effects as stress overshoots , although , with slight inconsistency that we trust will not be confusing , we will characterize their strength by a parameter that we denote @xmath5 .",
    "what is the nature of the depinning transition as @xmath5 is increased from zero ? there are various scenarios one can readily envisage . for large enough @xmath5 , in the model",
    "we introduce in the next section , an infinitesimal increase in @xmath0 from _ any _ pinned state will result in a non - zero average velocity at long times .",
    "this is because sufficiently large stress overshoots always induce other segments to move when triggered by an initial segment that moves in response to an increase in @xmath0 .",
    "the increased triggering will spawn further motion , despite the fact that the stress overshoot is only temporary .",
    "this process will run away ; and the manifold will acquire a non - zero average velocity . while it might thus seem likely that the transition will become  first - order \" for large enough @xmath5 ,",
    "does it do so for arbitrary small @xmath5 ?",
    "if there are regimes in which the depinning is indeed discontinuous in some way , is there macroscopic hysteresis ? in what sense ?",
    "more generally , what happens to the depinning transition beyond the dissipative limit ?",
    "if it remains critical  at least in some respects  for a range of @xmath5 , what is its nature",
    "? can the quasistatic behavior persist macroscopically for small @xmath5 in spite of the presence of additional microscopic hysteresis ?",
    "if so , what is the size dependence of the hysteresis and related phenomena ?",
    "the system size dependence is particularly relevant for geological faults for which the statistics of the earthquakes are affected both by the nature of the drive and the distribution of the  sizes \" of faults .",
    "several recent papers have undertaken some preliminary studies of the effects of stress overshoots in models of depinning of elastic manifolds .",
    "reference @xcite studied several one - dimensional models with long - range elasticity and stress overshoots motivated by planar crack fronts driven by applied loads .",
    "reference @xcite introduced a particularly simple model with short - range static elasticity and analyzed its infinite - range limit in which all segments of the manifold are equally coupled to each other . in this limit ,",
    "the spatial properties of the manifold are averaged away ; only time dependence remains and mean field theory becomes exact .",
    "such mean field models were the starting point for theoretical understanding of the finite - dimensional physics in the quasistatic limit @xcite .",
    "whether or not they provide a useful starting point beyond the dissipative limit , is one of the questions that we must address .",
    "in this paper , we investigate numerically and phenomenologically the finite - range version of the stress overshoot model introduced in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the basic lattice model on which we focus . in section",
    "iii the general scaling picture is introduced and known results for the dissipative case are summarized . in section",
    "iv the critical behavior in the moving phase is studied , initially for the dissipative case , and then in the presence of stress overshoots .",
    "we summarize a variety of evidence that the critical behavior which occurs as the driving force is decreased until the system stops is in the _ same _ universality class as the dissipative case .",
    "section v turns to the key aspect of overshoots : hysteresis .",
    "we analyze the hysteresis loops that occur when the system is stopped from the moving phase and restarted by gradually increasing the force .",
    "various puzzling aspects of the data are discussed and some understanding of the hysteresis loops in terms of a low density of segments that can be readily triggered by an increase in @xmath0 is reached . in the following section ,",
    "studies of the dynamics and statistics of avalanches that occur as the force is gradually increased are presented .",
    "these again lead to puzzling dependence on overshoot and pinning strengths although some aspects of the avalanches appear very similar to those in the dissipative limit .",
    "the data suggest various subtle crossovers may be occurring . in section",
    "vii the dynamics of the nucleation of restarting after a system has been stopped from the moving phase are analyzed .",
    "it is found that over a substantial range of sizes , bubble - like nucleation can occur .    in section viii",
    "the puzzling aspects of the various sets of data are tentatively resolved in terms of a crossover as a function of length scale and system size that manifests itself in different ways as the various parameters are varied . finally , in section ix , the conclusions are summarized and",
    "applications to the dynamics of earthquakes are discussed briefly ,    in the main body of this paper , we restrict consideration to weak enough overshoots that they do not totally change the local dynamics .",
    "but for sufficiently large @xmath5 , the overshoots cause dramatic changes in the macroscopic behavior .",
    "although these are interesting , they are probably peculiar to certain aspects of the model ; results on these will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "near the depinning transition , the dynamics is very jerky with segments of the manifold spending most of their time stationary or almost so , but occasionally getting unpinned by the forces from other segments and moving forward only to get pinned again by a combination of the newly explored random forces and the elasticity .",
    "the inherent discreteness of these _ local jumps _ suggests that we model the manifold as a large number of segments that can jump discontinuously from one pinning position to another ; this is also convenient for numerical studies .",
    "we define @xmath6 to be the _ single - valued _ scalar displacement of the manifold from some undeformed reference configuration with both the position , @xmath7 and the time , @xmath8 , taken to be discrete .",
    "note that by constraining the displacement field to be single - valued , we exclude  overhangs \" as well as defects such as dislocations that could otherwise occur in periodic systems .",
    "the forces on a segment of the manifold consist of three terms : the applied force @xmath0 , a static random pinning force @xmath9 , and the stress caused by the elasticity @xmath10 .",
    "the stress depends linearly on the displacements of other parts of the manifold via @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the sum is over nearest neighbors of @xmath7 . to model stress overshoots",
    ", we assume the simplest possible form : that the overshoot only applies to neighbors and only lasts for one time step so that @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 the number of nearest neighbors . with this stress transfer ,",
    "the jump of any nearest neighbor of @xmath7 induces an extra temporary stress on the @xmath7th segment . when @xmath16 , the stress transferred to the @xmath7th segment is simply proportional to the static curvature at @xmath7 .",
    "this stress will not decrease with time as long as the @xmath7th segment does not move and the other segments only move forward or remain at rest ; this limit is thus the dissipative dynamics already studied extensively .",
    "however , for positive @xmath5 the stress on the @xmath7th segment caused by a jump forward of one of its neighboring segments will first increase by a larger amount than in the absence of @xmath5 and then _ decrease _ at the next time step to reach its quasistatic value .",
    "modeling of the local pinning forces also involves substantial arbitrariness . in ref .",
    "@xcite we chose randomly spaced pinning positions for each segment with uniform pinning strengths , but this choice did not affect substantially the mean field behavior @xcite . for our present purposes , it is more convenient to choose the pinning positions for each segment to be uniformly spaced but with their _ yield strengths _ , the maximum force they can sustain , randomly distributed . in particular , we take the distribution of these yield strengths to be uniformly distributed from @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "because these random forces pin , or hold back , the manifold the corresponding forces @xmath18 , take on negative values in the range @xmath19 . with this form of the pinning forces , the equation of motion",
    "is simply given by @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the unit step function .",
    "the theta function is imposed so that a segment can move only forward and does so when the net force @xmath22 on it ( the argument of the theta function ) , is positive ; otherwise it remains stationary . with this dynamics ,",
    "when a segment jumps its displacement always increases by one . as long as @xmath23 , the ( artificial ) upper limit on the velocity ,",
    "this automaton dynamics mimics the continuous time motion reasonably well .",
    "note that in the absence of elasticity , with @xmath16 , @xmath24 with each segment becoming stuck on an anomalously strong pinning site . in the presence of the elasticity ,",
    "not all of the segments can be simultaneously pinned on strong pinning sites , and the critical force will decrease . for weak pinning forces , however , the definition of the applied force in this model is somewhat pathological : when released from a pinning segment , a segment can jump forward far enough that the total force on it becomes negative and it can then pull forward other segments resulting in overall motion even if @xmath0 is negative . to make it more realistic , one could replace @xmath0 by @xmath25 ; so that there is always enough force to make the forces at pinning segments non - negative .",
    "with non - zero @xmath5 , another adjustment should really be made as more realistic forms of stress overshoot involve a concomitant negative force on the segment that has moved .",
    "since the zero of the applied force is entirely a convention , we will not make these adjustments ; this will mean , however , that in some regimes the critical  force \" will be negative .",
    "several additional aspects of the model need to be specified : the initial conditions and the order of the updating . to avoid lock - step or other  faceting \" like behavior @xcite , we choose the pinning positions of each segment to be offset from one another by random amounts in the interval @xmath26 $ ] . because of the integer character of the jumps , the fractional part of the displacement of a given segment does not evolve with time .",
    "it might be thought that the displacement - independent randomness induced by this constraint could dominate over the randomness of interest , especially as far as determining the variations of critical forces , etc . in finite size systems .",
    "[ indeed , just such an effect does occur for systems with periodic randomness such as charge density waves @xcite .",
    "but in the present case it can be shown that the additional randomness is analogous to a spatially random force that is the derivative of a random function .",
    "this , combined with the statistical tilt symmetry , mean that its effects are subdominant for large systems ( although they could give rise to additional corrections to scaling . )",
    "the fact that the variations in the critical forces in finite size systems decrease substantially faster than the inverse square root of their area supports this assertion .",
    "the updating of the displacements are done in _ parallel _",
    "after computing all of the stresses .",
    "while there are alternate sequential methods of updating , this parallel method requires the least amount of computation and does not appear to introduce any troublesome artifacts in the regime of smallish @xmath5 of primary interest here .",
    "finally , to limit boundary effects , we impose periodic boundary conditions on @xmath6 .",
    "this is especially important as we will use finite size scaling to analyze much of the data ; this is substantially more straightforward with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our simulations are restricted to two dimensions which we chose because of the availability of the widest range of system sizes without running into the complications associated with very large stresses that arise in one dimensional depinning with short range interactions .",
    "we study systems of size @xmath27 up to @xmath28 with most of our  large \" system data on @xmath29 samples .",
    "before presenting new results for the systems of interest with stress overshoots , we briefly summarize the scaling behavior that obtains near the critical force in the absence of stress overshoots ; i.e. for @xmath16 . as the force is adiabatically increased from zero , local instabilities lead to a succession of _ avalanches _ , most of which will be small , but which can occasionally become large as the unique critical force @xmath30 is approached .",
    "above @xmath30 the mean velocity in the statistical steady state rises continuously with an exponent @xmath31 .",
    "the motion is jerky out to length scales of order the velocity _ correlation length _",
    "@xmath32 which diverges at the critical force as @xmath33 the characteristic time for relaxation on scales of order @xmath32 is @xmath34 and in this time the manifold typically moves forward by an amount @xmath35 these three exponents , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 characterize the scaling behavior near the transition .",
    "the velocity exponent is related to these via the observation that the mean velocity is of order the characteristic displacement per characteristic time so that @xmath39 with @xmath40    in the pinned phase , the critical behavior as the force is adiabatically increased can , in the absence of stress overshoots , be related to that in the moving phase reviewed above . in particular",
    ", the scaling of the dynamics and shape of the avalanches , the probability that they will be large , the divergence as @xmath30 is approached of the cutoff size in their distribution , and the  roughness \" of the manifold at the critical point are all given in terms of the same three exponents .",
    "in section vi we will discuss the avalanches in detail , but for now we focus on the macroscopic behavior such as the velocity in the moving phase and the mean displacements in the pinned phase .",
    "the mean displacement in response to a spatially varying applied force yields , via a statistical symmetry of the system , a scaling law that relates two of the exponents .",
    "this relation can be derived from the average static polarizability @xmath41 to a perturbing force @xmath42 . a change of variables to @xmath43 , yields an equation of motion for @xmath44 that is statistically identical to the original one for @xmath45 , _ independent _ of the perturbing force .",
    "therefore @xmath46 since the polarizability should scale as @xmath47 , with @xmath48 a scaling function , this yields the scaling law @xmath49      the critical exponents for @xmath16 take simple mean field values of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , characteristic of diffusive dynamics , and @xmath52 above the critical dimension of @xmath53 for short range elasticity",
    ". the velocity scales with @xmath54 @xcite .    below four dimensions ,",
    "renormalization group expansions have been performed that justify the scaling laws and claims of universality as well as yielding results for the exponents as expansions in powers of @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 these yield @xmath58 recently chauve et al @xcite have computed these exponents to second - order in @xmath59 , obtaining ( 1 + 0.14331 )   and z2 - - 0.04321 ^2  , although there are some doubts about the validity of these second - order results @xcite .",
    "we will shortly turn to presentation of our numerical results for the critical behavior in the moving phase . but first , it is instructive to summarize the behavior found in the mean field limit for small @xmath5 and to consider several possible scenarios that might obtain in short - range systems .",
    "we can then determine which scenario is most consistent with the data .      in the mean field limit all of the sites",
    "are coupled to all of the others so that the number of  nearest neighbors \" @xmath15 is equal to the number of segments , @xmath60 ( more precisely , @xmath61 ) . in this limit",
    ", the critical force is found to be _",
    "unchanged _ for @xmath5 less than a critical value , @xmath62 .",
    "the velocity versus force curve is modified for any non - zero @xmath5 , however , but the exponent @xmath31 remains at its quasistatic value of @xmath54 for @xmath63 .",
    "the other universal properties of the transition are also unchanged for small @xmath5 , including the lack of hysteresis in steady state and the asymptotics of the distribution of large avalanches as the critical force is approached from below",
    ".    the simplest scenario for the short range systems of interest would be like that of the mean field limit : unchanged critical behavior and no macroscopic hysteresis for small @xmath5 .",
    "but previous work has shown that this _ can not _ be the case : as shown in references @xcite , @xcite , _ any _ stress overshoot will cause the critical force to be shifted downwards , in the sense that dynamic behavior can persist for some ( @xmath5-dependent ) range of forces below the quasistatic critical force @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that some form of macroscopic hysteresis can exist since locally stable  at least linearly stable  static configurations exist up to @xmath30 . but",
    "whether such configurations are non - linearly stable to , for example , an arbitrarily small increase in @xmath0 , is a question of substantial importance to which we will return later . for",
    "now , we focus on the moving states and how they stop as the force is lowered .",
    "the _ simplest scenario _ that can not immediately be ruled out is a modified version of the mean field scenario : a velocity versus force curve with a well defined critical force , @xmath64 , that is non - hysteretic as the force is decreased ; history independent steady states above @xmath65 ; and critical exponents , @xmath66 unchanged from their quasistatic values . in renormalization group language , this would correspond to @xmath5 being an _ irrelevant _ perturbation at least as far as behavior in the _ moving phase_.    if this mean - field - like scenario indeed applies for small @xmath5 to the finite - range model , we expect the following scaling behavior for both @xmath5 and the proximity to the @xmath5-dependent critical force , ff-(m ) .",
    "small : @xmath67 with the crossover exponent @xmath68 indicating the irrelevance of @xmath5 , and @xmath69 a scaling function .",
    "in analogous situations in equilibrium statistical mechanics , if a parameter such as @xmath5 does not change the nature of the transition , the effect of @xmath5 on @xmath70 can be taken into account perturbatively .",
    "because of the singular nature of the critical fixed point that describes the quasistatic depinning  resulting , in part , from the absence of thermal fluctuations but , more essentially , from the jerky nature of the motion  the  analytic parts \" might not be smooth functions of @xmath5 , but under the assumption that they are , we expect that f^_c(m)=f_c0-am - bm^2 +   . nevertheless , there can be singular _ corrections to scaling _ determined by the form of @xmath69 and the crossover exponent @xmath71 .",
    "this scenario , in which @xmath5 is irrelevant when it is small , we call the _ dissipative scenario_. we note , however , that this scenario is compatible with a change in behavior at a critical value of @xmath5 as occurs in mean field theory",
    ". this would give rise , for @xmath5 close to its critical value , to a crossover to some kind of multicritical behavior emerging at larger velocities .",
    "more interesting behavior would occur if the qualitative mean field results on the effects of small @xmath5 do _ not _ simply carry over to the finite - range case .",
    "this would be the case if @xmath5 is a _ relevant _ perturbation and would correspond to a crossover scaling function , such as @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( 22 ) with @xmath71 positive .",
    "a relevant perturbation @xmath5 would yield a singular correction to the critical force of the form [ f_c0-f_c^(m)]_sing ~m^1/ , which would dominate over the leading ( or subdominant ) analytic shift if @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) .",
    "earlier numerical results by ramanathan and fisher suggested that this might be the case @xcite .",
    "there are two simple scenarios for the velocity versus force if @xmath5 is relevant .",
    "one possibility is that the depinning transition is driven _ discontinuous immediately _ for any non - zero @xmath5 .",

    "note that we have explicitly _ not _ considered scenarios in which the velocity in the moving phase is hysteretic . although we can not rule this out entirely , the fact that the random environment through which the manifold moves acts , to some extent , like thermal noise , suggests that if there were more than one possible moving phase for the same applied force , there would be some stochastic process by which the system could jump from one to the other .",
    "the result of this would be that , as in equilibrium transitions , true ",

    "the intermediate @xmath5 samples could then appear to have substantially different scaling by virtue of being in the crossover regime over the range of length scales studied , in the next subsection we see how such crossover behavior might arise from the production and development of avalanches and the effects each has on subsequent ones .",
    "we have seen that with stress overshoots , static configurations exist in finite size samples at forces that are substantially above ( on the scale of variations of @xmath186 ) the force , @xmath65 , at which the whole system can move .",
    "this suggests that in this regime there may be a change in character of the avalanches as they become large .",
    "in contrast to below @xmath65 where all avalanches will stop , if an avalanche above @xmath65 becomes larger than some characteristic size , naively , perhaps the velocity correlation length , @xmath187 , in the moving phase , it will runaway and the whole system will move .",

    "in contrast to the dissipative limit for which @xmath188 increases sharply with @xmath0 as @xmath190 , the data for non - zero @xmath5 show a peak in the avalanche production rate somewhat below @xmath65 and then a marked decrease as @xmath0 increases into the region in which some samples have self sustaining avalanches and become depinned .",
    "for the strongly pinned systems this suppression is strong ; the behavior in the region in which @xmath188 is small is shown blownup in the figure .",
    "note that in this regime the avalanche production rate is two orders of magnitude lower for @xmath191 and @xmath192 than for @xmath16 .",
    "although we have not studied it in detail , this decrease in avalanche production rate is presumably related to the depletion of close - to - unstable sites in regions in which moderately sized avalanches have already occurred ; this is analogous to the depletion that occurs after the whole system is stopped from the moving phase .",
    "such depletion will suppress both the density of  seeds \" of avalanches and the probability of them becoming large .",
    "most new avalanches would be expected to occur in regions that have not yet had substantial sized avalanches .",
    "the exception to this are avalanches that get up enough steam that they can run through the depleted regions .",
    "once an avalanche does this , it will continue growing until it sweeps through the whole system and becomes self sustaining .",
    "as the chances of this happening will depend on the properties of various regions of the system , how large it has to become to runaway is likely to be subtle .",
    "there are three possible behaviors for the runaway process of large avalanches in the regime above @xmath65 : ( i ) that there is a finite sample - size - independent length scale , @xmath193 above which avalanches typically run away , ( ii ) that the scale at which runaway occurs grows with system size , but as a decreasing _ fraction _ of system size , or ( iii ) that the runaway scale is proportional to system size in large samples . in the dissipative limit ,",
    "the last of these obtains with a proportionality constant close to unity .",
    "in contrast , in the artificial model discussed earlier with overshoot stresses felt for the duration of an avalanche , once all segments have moved at least once , an increase of the force by @xmath97 is needed to cause another avalanche and when one does occur it is likely to run away after its diameter becomes of order the velocity correlation length @xmath32 of the moving phase at that force . why this is the controlling length scale",

    "in contrast , the avalanche distributions observed in this regime with strong pinning suggest that there may be a crossover from dissipative-_critical_-like behavior for smaller sizes to dissipative-_cumulative_-like behavior for larger sizes , with the crossover occurring for @xmath195 of order @xmath196 ; if this _ fixed fraction _ of @xmath197 persists for larger sizes , it would support the third scenario .    in the next section",
    "we develop these ideas further and test them in the context of the restarting of the manifold after it has come to a stop from the moving phase .",
    "in the previous section we studied some aspects of how the system becomes depinned when it has not previously undergone macroscopic motion .",
    "we now return to the related question of how the manifold restarts after it has been stopped by a slow decrease of the force from the moving phase .",

    "the range over which the distribution of @xmath199 extends is broader , i.e. from @xmath65 to @xmath200 .",
    "note that for all these strong pinning samples , the range over which the restarting occurs is two orders of magnitude larger than the width of the distribution of @xmath65 .",
    "although some fraction of the samples of size @xmath78 will restart the first time a site is triggered , by no means all will and in general there will be a distribution of avalanche sizes before restarting . in fig .",
    "[ p1.0plot](b ) the distribution of the areas of these avalanches are shown for the same parameters as above .",

    "but the measured exponent it is close to that of the _ cumulative _ distribution of dissipative avalanches .",
    "we conjecture that in the stopped states the length scale above which an avalanche is likely to runaway and restart the overall motion is of order the velocity correlation length , @xmath187 , of the moving phase at the same force .",
    "this can be rationalized from the behavior of the moving phase .    at a force that is only a small amount @xmath104 above @xmath65 ,",

    "the form of the avalanche distribution in hysteresis loops with a very low density of nucleation segments should be apparent from the discussion at the end of the previous section : most avalanches will take place when @xmath0 is close to the @xmath199 at which the system restarts , thus it is the distribution @xmath237 in this regime that will dominate the cumulative statistics .",

    "the dynamics of a typical runaway event will reflect this crossover .",
    "initially , it will start as a fractal avalanche similar to those in the dissipative limit .",
    "but when  and if  an avalanche reaches the crossover length of order @xmath241 , it will crossover to bubble like expansion with its interior behaving like the moving phase and its radius expanding linearly in time at a rate , @xmath209 , that scales as @xmath243 . as the distribution of @xmath244 is broad , however , there will be substantial run - to - run variations in both the crossover size and the rate of growth of the bubble .    the behavior of the size dependence of the distribution of widths of the hysteresis loops , as shown in figs .",
    "[ loopwidth1.0plot](a ) ( b ) , can also be better understood in this framework .",

    "in contrast , in very large samples , we expect that the restarting will typically occur at forces @xmath245 which are above @xmath246 by of order the width of the distribution of @xmath65 . yet",
    "because of the strong suppression of the density , @xmath188 , of seeds for nucleation of avalanches in the stopped system , in practice the numerical factors , @xmath247 can be very large .",
    "the distribution of @xmath247 in the small @xmath240 limit is broad , and has a shape close to a weibull distribution with characteristic scale @xmath248 and shape parameter @xmath249 but we do not expect it to be exactly of this form .",
    "the reason is due to the breakdown of the argument given in section v : in sufficiently small subregions of size @xmath250 of a system of size @xmath114 , the possible nucleation processes are _ not _ independent from one subregion to the next .",
    "this is because the diameter of a critical nucleation avalanche when it crosses over to approximately deterministic bubble - like growth is of order @xmath187 which is of order a _ fixed _  albeit @xmath240 dependent  fraction of @xmath197 at the typical forces at which the first runaway avalanche occurs in a large system . thus the division into approximately independent subregions will not work for @xmath251 .    because the hysteresis loops vanish in the limit of large systems , the total number of avalanches per unit area that will occur in a hysteresis loop decreases as a power of system size .",
    "this will also occur in the dissipative limit , however in that case the  runaway \" avalanches that occur for @xmath252 will not have all that much larger moment than ones that only involve , say , half the system area .",
    "but due to the strong suppression of avalanche production after a large event , in the presence of substantial stress overshoots the total number of avalanches will be further reduced in spite of the hysteresis loop becoming wider .",
    "the above analysis implies that the total number of avalanches per unit area that occur in the hysteresis loop will be of order : n_aval ~r^1-  .",
    "furthermore , the runaway avalanche will typically run for a very long way  probably exponentially far in @xmath253  before stopping at a displacement , @xmath45 , for which the total pinning is anomalously strong .    at this point , it is not clear that the numerical data are consistent with this picture . in particular",
    ", it appears that the size dependence of the widths of the hysteresis loops is somewhat weaker than would be expected asymptotically .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the deviation of the scaling of the width of the hysteresis loops from the @xmath254 scaling expected asymptotically is most likely associated with the crossover from the small system to large system behavior . in sufficiently large systems",
    ", we conjecture that =  .",
    "the complicated avalanche behavior observed when depinning is approached for the first time starting from almost flat initial conditions is probably due to a hybrid of effects .",
    "for the strong pinning samples with substantial - sized overshoots , in systems of size @xmath255 enough avalanches typically occur before runaway that a strong suppression of the avalanche production rate occurs over the whole system .",
    "this suppression enables the force to be increased well past the range in which runaway would occur in the dissipative limit , although not as far as it can for samples that have been stopped from the moving phase .",
    "the statistics of the avalanches in this regime will have a similar form to that of avalanches in the hysteresis loops discussed above , with a crossover from critical - like to cumulative - like at a length scale that depends on how strongly @xmath188 has been suppressed .",
    "for the weaker pinning samples , for example with @xmath165 and @xmath103 , the rate of avalanche production is not suppressed nearly as strongly and it is most likely that the crossover regime is right in the middle of the range of sample sizes studied .",
    "further systematic tests to investigate this overall scenario would be very useful .",
    "in particular , one would like to understand on what aspects of the model , parameters , and history , crucial quantities such as the suppression of avalanche production rate after a large avalanche , depend .",
    "in this paper we have introduced and studied numerically and by scaling analyses a simple model of depinning transitions in which there are dynamic stress overshoots caused by rapid motion of segments of the manifold .",
    "we have produced a substantial amount of evidence that the macroscopic behavior of this model with various kinds of generic initial conditions is _ not _",
    "hysteretic for a wide range of stress overshoots in spite of the coexistence over a range of the driving force of static configurations and steady state moving configurations .",
    "in particular , the critical force , @xmath256 is _ uniquely defined and history independent _ in the limit of large systems ; the distributions of the critical force , @xmath65 , at which steady state motion ceases , that at which it restarts when the force is increased from such a stopped state , @xmath199 , and that at which macroscopic motion commences when the force is increased from a flat initial condition for the first time , @xmath183 , are all narrow and converge to @xmath256 in the limit of large systems .",
    "furthermore , the steady state velocity , @xmath113 , is a unique function of the driving force , @xmath0 that vanishes as a universal power of @xmath257 . nevertheless , in principle there are static configurations that could be reached by careful enough control of the dynamics of all the system for all forces up to @xmath258 .",
    "but if the system were to be started in such a configuration and the force increased by an amount that is arbitrarily small in the limit of a large system , an avalanche would be triggered that would runaway and cause the whole system to start moving .",
    "the universality class of the depinning transition for all @xmath5 less than a multicritical value @xmath259 appears to be that of the purely dissipative limit without stress overshoots that has been analyzed by renormalization group methods previously .",
    "this universality class is thus much broader than had been conjectured .",
    "the crucial feature of the dynamics on which this macroscopic uniqueness and universality relies is the existence of a non - zero density of nucleation sites for new avalanches after an avalanche has run through a region .",
    "these must exist for arbitrarily small increases of the applied force even if their density , @xmath240 , is much lower than it would have been in the absence of stress overshoots .",
    "if these did not exist  more precisely if there were a depletion layer of local forces after an avalanche then there would be macroscopic hysteresis with the force needing to be increased by the width of the depletion layer to restart the system once it has stopped after having moved previously .      in the remainder of this last section",
    "we summarize the behavior that occurs in our model for a range of @xmath5 in which there is a strongly suppressed density of nucleation seeds .",
    "we also consider briefly under what circumstances similar behavior will obtain ; and discuss some of the consequences for a system in which understanding the finite size effects is crucial : earthquakes on a geological fault .    in the dissipative limit of our model ,",
    "all finite size effects in the vicinity of the depinning transition occur within a range of forces around @xmath1 of width of order @xmath260 .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of stress overshoots finite - size effects can be important over a much wider range of forces .",
    "these effects will be particularly pronounced if the suppression of nucleation seeds for further avalanches is very strong , i.e. if after a system spanning avalanche the density of nucleation segments , @xmath240 , is very small .    with @xmath240 small ,",
    "unless samples are sufficiently large , @xmath261 there will usually be no nucleation until the force has been increased by the magnitude , @xmath97 , of the overshoots . unless @xmath5 is very small",
    ", the nucleation will then be bubble - like with rapid motion in a linearly expanding bubble occurring as soon as one segment is triggered . for larger systems ,",
    "the width of hysteresis loops will start to decrease and eventually , if the scenario presented above is correct , decrease as @xmath260 but with a large coefficient that is a randomly varying multiple of @xmath248 .",
    "sites that are triggered as @xmath0 is increased after the whole system has been stopped may result in finite avalanches with a distribution that crosses over from one power law to another as a function of their size .",
    "eventually one of these avalanches will runaway : initially it will grow in a fractal manner , but when its diameter reaches of order @xmath262 , it will began to expand in a more deterministic manner at an approximately constant rate until it covers the whole system and the macroscopic motion restarts . in the limit of small @xmath240 this regime of bubble growth will obtain over a wide range of length scales .      the picture presented here for effects of stress overshoots on the dynamics of finite size systems that occur as the driving force is varied have particularly interesting consequences for models of earthquakes on disordered faults .",
    "the appropriate driving to model a geological fault is not a constant force , by rather driving by a weak spring .",
    "this is roughly equivalent for our case with short range elastic interactions to replacing the applied force by a  pulling spring \" with f(t)=(v_s t-|h(t ) ) where @xmath263 is an effective elastic constant of order unity , the @xmath264 factor arises from the @xmath265 elasticity , and |h(t)=_*x * h(*x*,t ) is the spatially averaged displacement .",
    "as has been discussed previously , @xcite in the absence of stress overshoots a system driven with an infinitesimal  shearing \" velocity , @xmath266 ,  self - organizes \" into a statistically steady state with a power law distribution of avalanche diameters that falls off as @xmath267 out to length scales of order @xmath197 , ( the cutoff being affected by the magnitude of @xmath263 ) .",
    "there is no particular qualitative distinction between the character of  earthquakes \" that have substantial @xmath268 and those with @xmath269 .    with stress overshoots that give rise to a substantial reduction of the density of seeds for nucleating new events , the behavior is quite different .",
    "as the pulling spring advances there will be a string of avalanches until one runs away and the whole system moves .",
    "this motion will only stop when the force @xmath270 has decreased as a result of the motion to @xmath65 , a force that will have variations of order @xmath260 .",
    "as the spring slowly restretches , the pulling force will increase again and a series of quakes of various sizes will occur at a rate given by @xmath271 .",
    "these events will not relieve much of the accumulating stress and so the force will continue to increase until a force @xmath199 at which a runaway event occurs .",
    "the typical magnitude of @xmath244 and the width of its distribution are both of order @xmath272 , the evolution of the runaway event will at first be fractal , but then a crossover to bubble - like growth will occur and it will grow with constant expansion rate until the whole system is moving",
    ".    the initial slip velocity of the large earthquake will be of order @xmath273 which will vary substantially , but have typical magnitude v_r~ as it runs , the driving force will gradually decrease until it gets down to another @xmath65 at which point it will stop .",
    "the total displacement in such an event will be of order @xmath274 and its moment hence of order m_r~l^dh~ bigger by the @xmath240 dependent factor than the typical largest events in the dissipative limit .",
    "[ in obtaining this result , the scaling law @xmath275 was used . ]    the distribution of earthquake moments in this model will be a composite of characteristic earthquake and gutenberg - richter - like statistics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "small events will have a power law distribution with exponent @xmath276 that will obtain out to moments of order m_x~(lr^)^d+   , much smaller than @xmath277 for small @xmath240 , the distribution of larger events will fall off more rapidly with exponent @xmath278 out to events with moments of order @xmath279 .",
    "events larger than this will not occur unless they are runaway events . as these run for a considerably larger @xmath280 before stopping , there will be a strong suppression of the distribution of moments from @xmath281 out to of order @xmath277 , but the runaway events will have a non - trivial distribution .",
    "this picture implies interesting anticorrelations between the occurrences of the largest of the intermediate size and the runaway events : the former are more likely to occur relatively soon after a runaway event rather than just before one because at later stages in the  earthquake cycle \" , once an event gets to a small fraction of the system size , it will almost certainly runaway .",
    "some information on the statistics of the largest events can also be inferred from the approximate weibull form of the distribution of @xmath199 which will primarily determine the moments of the largest events .    in order to translate these results to models more appropriate for geological faults",
    ", the elasticity needs to be long - ranged , with static stress transfer falling off as j(*x,*y)~ in the two dimensional case of interest for all but the biggest earthquakes .",
    "this modifies scaling laws to @xmath282 and @xmath283 . in the absence of long range correlations in the random properties of the fault , in the dissipative limit",
    "the predicted value of @xmath38 is zero , up to logarithms . but with long - range correlated randomness it could be substantially larger . * *    the consequences of the scenario suggested by our results for geological fault dynamics certainly merits further investigation along these and other lines . but to conclude this paper , we turn to another important issue : how much can be carried over from the stress overshoot model to other types of local dynamic effects ?",
    "we should remark that this scenario is valid within the context of @xmath284 for very large systems .      at the beginning of this paper",
    "we argued that some of the effects of local inertia of a driven , pinned elastic manifold would be qualitatively similar to the effects of stress overshoots .",
    "a key question to raise at this point is whether the finite density of seeds for future avalanche events will be left behind in inertial systems .",
    "we conjecture that this will be the case if the inertia is not too large , as we found here for stress overshoots , but this bears more careful thought .    in the context of earthquakes ,",
    "a more important issue is dynamic frictional weakening .",
    "an extreme form of frictional weakening was considered in @xcite : if once a segment has moved it is always easier for it to move again at any time in the same earthquake , this will certainly give rise to macroscopic hysteresis .",
    "as long as there is healing back up to a higher strength between events , a system spanning event will leave behind a configuration that can not start moving again until the driving force has increased again by enough to overcome the difference between the static and dynamic friction . in reality , the history dependence of frictional forces is complicated and some healing will occur already during an event on those segments that slow down or stop while other parts are still moving . but whether this , combined with dynamic stress overshoots , will leave behind a finite density of nucleation sites for easily triggerable events is a difficult but important question .",
    "although this paper has perhaps raised as many questions as it has answered , the progress it represents in understanding of the dynamics of driven elastic manifolds in the presence of both randomness and non - dissipative dynamics should help frame and address some of the key questions that remain .",
