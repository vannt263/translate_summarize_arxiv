    "in the recent past , much progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of inclusive charmless @xmath8 decays near the kinematic endpoint of small @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the energy and momentum of the final - state hadronic system in the @xmath8-meson rest frame . in @xmath2",
    "decays the @xmath15 variable is related to the @xmath8-meson mass and the photon energy , @xmath16 , and the measurement of its spectrum leads directly to the extraction of the leading hadronic structure function , called the shape function @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 spectrum in semileptonic @xmath0 decays , on the other hand , enables us to determine @xmath6 @xcite , but this requires a precise knowledge of the shape function .",
    "one approach for measuring @xmath6 is to first extract the shape function from the @xmath2 photon spectrum , and then to use this information for predictions of event distributions in @xmath0 .",
    "a comprehensive description of this program has been presented in @xcite .",
    "equivalently , it is possible to eliminate the shape function in @xmath0 decay rates in favor of the @xmath2 photon - energy spectrum .",
    "this idea was first put forward in @xcite and later refined in @xcite .",
    "partial @xmath0 decay rates are then given as weighted integrals over the @xmath2 photon - energy spectrum , @xmath17 where the weight function @xmath18 is perturbatively calculable at leading power in @xmath5 .",
    "a comparison of both sides of the equation determines the ckm matrix element @xmath6 directly . for the measurement of the left - hand side to be free of charm background",
    ", @xmath7 must be less than @xmath19gev .",
    "however , the @xmath15 spectrum in @xmath0 decays displays many of the features of the charged - lepton energy spectrum , so that it is not inconceivable that the cut can be further relaxed for the same reasons that experimenters are able to relax the lepton cut beyond the charm threshold .",
    "we stress that for an application of relation ( [ eq : relation ] ) a measurement of the @xmath2 photon spectrum is needed only for @xmath20gev ( or slightly lower , if the cut is relaxed into the charm region ) .",
    "this high - energy part of the spectrum has already been measured with good precision .",
    "previous authors @xcite have considered relations such as ( [ eq : relation ] ) in the slightly different form @xmath21 normalizing the photon spectrum by the total @xcite . ]",
    "rate @xmath22 as done in ( [ eq : relation ] ) has several advantages .",
    "firstly , it is a known fact that event fractions in @xmath2 decay can be calculated with better accuracy than partial decay rates ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) , and likewise the normalized rate does not suffer from the relatively large experimental error on the total branching ratio .",
    "secondly , relation ( [ eq : relation ] ) is independent of the ckm factor @xmath23 .",
    "thirdly , unlike the total @xmath2 decay rate , the shape of the photon spectrum is rather insensitive to possible new physics contributions @xcite , which could distort the outcome of a @xmath6 measurement via relation ( [ oldrelation ] ) .",
    "lastly , as we will see below , the weight function @xmath18 possesses a much better perturbative expansion than the function @xmath24 .",
    "this last point can be traced back to the fact that most of the very large contribution from the @xmath25 operator mixing in the effective weak hamiltonian cancels in the theoretical expression for the normalized photon spectrum .    in principle",
    ", any partial @xmath0 decay rate can be brought into the form ( [ eq : relation ] ) , with complicated weight functions .",
    "the relation between the two @xmath15 spectra is particularly simple , because the leading - power weight function is a constant at tree level .",
    "experiments typically reject semileptonic @xmath8-decay events with very low lepton energy .",
    "the effect of such an additional cut can be determined from @xcite . alternatively , it is possible to modify the weight function so as to account for a lepton cut , however at the expense of a significant increase in complexity .",
    "we will not pursue this option in the present work .",
    "the weight function depends on the kinematical variable @xmath15 and on the size @xmath7 of the integration domain .",
    "it possesses integrable singularities of the form @xmath26 $ ] , with @xmath27 , in perturbation theory .",
    "different strategies can be found in the literature concerning these logarithms .",
    "leibovich et al .",
    "resummed them by identifying @xmath28 with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence of the weight function then enters via the running coupling @xmath30 .",
    "this is a legitimate choice of scale as long as @xmath31 has a generic value of order @xmath32 ; however , it is _ not _ a valid choice in the small region where @xmath33 .",
    "a key result underlying relation ( [ eq : relation ] ) is that , by construction , the weight function is insensitive to soft physics .",
    "quark - hadron duality ensures that the region near the point @xmath34 , which is without any physical significance , does not require special consideration after integration over @xmath15 . in the approach of @xcite , the attempt to resum the above logarithms near the endpoint of the @xmath15 integral leads to integrals over unphysical landau singularities of the running coupling in the nonperturbative domain .",
    "hoang et al .  chose to calculate the weight function in fixed - order perturbation theory at the scale @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this leads to parametrically large logarithms , since @xmath36 . in the present paper we separate physics effects from two parametrically distinct scales , a hard scale @xmath37 and an intermediate scale @xmath38 , so that we neither encounter landau singularities nor introduce parametrically large logarithms .",
    "the shape of the weight function is then governed by a perturbative expansion at the intermediate scale , @xmath39 $ ] . as will be explained later ,",
    "the coefficients in this series , as well as the overall normalization , possess themselves an expansion in @xmath40 .",
    "the calculation of the weight function starts with the theoretical expressions for the @xmath15 spectra in @xmath0 and @xmath2 decays , which are given as @xcite @xmath41 ^ 2\\ ,      \\f_\\gamma(p_+ ) \\",
    ", , \\label{eq : gammas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 with @xmath43 is a kinematical variable that is integrated over the available phase space .",
    "expressions for the structure functions @xmath44 valid at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in renormalization - group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory and including first- and second - order power corrections can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "symbolically , they are written as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 contains matching corrections at the hard scale @xmath47 .",
    "the jet function @xmath48 , which is a perturbative quantity at the intermediate scale @xmath49 , is convoluted with a non - perturbative shape function renormalized at that same scale .",
    "separation of the two scales @xmath47 and @xmath49 allows for the logarithms in matching corrections to be small , while logarithms of the form @xmath50 , which appear at every order in perturbation theory , are resummed in a systematic fashion and give rise to the rg evolution functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the leading - power jet function @xmath53 entering the expressions for @xmath44 is universal and has been computed at one - loop order in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the two - loop expression for @xmath54 has been obtained apart from a single unknown constant @xcite , which is the two - loop coefficient of the local @xmath55 term .",
    "this constant does not enter in the two - loop result for the weight function @xmath18 in ( [ eq : relation ] ) .",
    "due to the universality of the leading - power jet function , it is possible to calculate the complete @xmath56 corrections to the weight function .",
    "however , the extraction of hard corrections at two - loop order would require multi - loop calculations for both decay processes , which are unavailable at present . as a result",
    ", we will be able to predict the @xmath7 and @xmath15 dependence of the weight function @xmath18 at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in rg - improved perturbation theory , including exact two - loop matching contributions and three - loop running effects .",
    "however , the overall normalization of the weight function will have an uncertainty of @xmath57 from yet unknown hard matching corrections .",
    "the total rate @xmath22 has been calculated in a local operator product expansion and reads ( including only the leading non - perturbative corrections ) @xcite @xmath58 ^ 2\\ ,     |h_s(\\mu_h)|^2\\,h_\\gamma(\\mu_h ) \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{9m_c^2}\\ ,      \\frac{c_1(\\mu_h)}{c_{7\\gamma}^{\\rm eff}(\\mu_h ) } \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the hard function of @xmath60 , and @xmath61 contains the remaining radiative corrections .",
    "we will present an explicit expression for this quantity at the end of section  [ sec : results ] below .",
    "the hadronic correction proportional to @xmath62 cancels against an identical term in @xmath60 .",
    "apart from two powers of the running @xmath63-quark mass defined in the @xmath64 scheme , which is part of the electromagnetic dipole operator @xmath65 in the effective weak hamiltonian , three more powers of @xmath66 emerge from phase - space integrations . to avoid the renormalon ambiguities of the pole scheme we use a low - scale subtracted quark - mass definition for @xmath66 .",
    "specifically , we adopt the shape - function mass @xmath67 @xcite defined at a subtraction scale @xmath68gev , which relates to the pole mass as @xmath69 throughout this paper we will use @xmath67 as the @xmath63-quark mass and refer to it as @xmath66 for brevity .",
    "the present value of this parameter is @xmath70gev @xcite .",
    "the key strategy for the calculation of the weight function is to make use of qcd factorization theorems for the decay distributions on both sides of ( [ eq : relation ] ) and to arrange the resulting , factorized expressions such that they are both given as integrals over the shape function , @xmath71 , with different functions @xmath72 for the left - hand and right - hand sides .",
    "relation  ( [ eq : relation ] ) can then be enforced by matching @xmath73 to @xmath74 . following this procedure , we find for the integrated @xmath15 spectrum in @xmath0 decay after a series of integration interchanges @xmath75 where @xmath76 , and @xcite @xmath77 is the integral over the jet function . for the sake of transparency",
    ", we often suppress the explicit dependence on @xmath49 and @xmath47 when it is clear at which scales the relevant quantities are defined .",
    "the function @xmath78 is a linear combination of the hard functions entering the structures @xmath44 in ( [ eq : gammau ] ) , which in the notation of @xcite is given by @xmath79 rg resummation effects build up the factor @xmath80 in ( [ eq : uswitch ] ) , where @xmath81 is the value of the rg - evolution function @xmath82 which depends only on the cusp anomalous dimension @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath83 has its origin in the geometry of time - like and light - like wilson lines underlying the kinematics of inclusive @xmath8 decays into light particles .",
    "our definition is such that @xmath83 is a positive number for @xmath84 and vanishes in the limit @xmath85 .",
    "we find it convenient to treat the function @xmath52 as a running `` physical '' quantity , much like @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "since the cusp anomalous dimension is known to three - loop order @xcite , the value of @xmath83 can be determined very accurately .",
    "note that three - loop accuracy in @xmath83 ( as well as in the running coupling @xmath88 ) is required for a consistent calculation of the weight function at nnlo .",
    "the corresponding expression is @xmath89      \\frac{\\alpha_s^2(\\mu_i ) - \\alpha_s^2(\\mu_h)}{32\\pi^2 } + \\dots \\bigg\\ } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expansion coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 of the cusp anomalous dimension and @xmath92-function can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .    instead of the jet function @xmath54 itself , we need its integral @xmath93 in the second line of ( [ eq : uswitch ] ) .",
    "since the jet function has a perturbative expansion in terms of `` star distributions '' , which are logarithmically sensitive to the upper limit of integration @xcite , it follows that @xmath94 is a simple polynomial in @xmath95 at each order in perturbation theory .",
    "the two - loop result for this quantity has recently been computed by solving the integro - differential evolution equation for the jet function @xcite .",
    "an unknown integration constant of @xmath96 does not enter the expression for the weight function .",
    "we now turn to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : relation ] ) and follow the same steps that lead to ( [ eq : uswitch ] ) .",
    "it is helpful to make an ansatz for the leading - power contribution to the weight function , @xmath97 , where the dependence on @xmath7 is solely given via an upper limit of integration . to this end",
    ", we define a function @xmath98 through @xmath99 this allows us to express the weighted integral over the @xmath2 photon spectrum as @xmath100 note that the jet function @xmath54 ( and with it @xmath101 ) is the same in semileptonic and radiative decays .",
    "the difference is that the argument of the jet function in ( [ eq : uswitch ] ) contains an extra factor of @xmath102 , which is absent in ( [ eq : sswitch ] ) .",
    "comparing these two relations leads us to the matching condition @xmath103 which holds to all orders in perturbation theory and allows for the calculation of @xmath97 via ( [ eq : fdef ] ) .",
    "the main feature of this important relation is that the particular value of @xmath104 is irrelevant for the determination of @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that , as was the case for the jet function @xmath54 , the perturbative expansion of @xmath98 in @xmath105 at the intermediate scale involves star distributions , and @xmath97 depends logarithmically on @xmath31 . at two - loop order",

    "indeed , these corrections are so large that in our opinion relation ( [ oldrelation ] ) should not be used for phenomenological purposes .",

    "while physics at or below the intermediate scale is very similar for @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( as is manifested by the fact that the leading shape and jet functions are universal ) , the physics at the hard scale in @xmath2 decay is considerably more complicated than in semileptonic decay , and it might even contain effects of new physics . therefore it is natural to respect the hierarchy @xmath234 and disentangle the various contributions , as done in the present work .",
    "in fact , our ability to calculate the dominant two - loop corrections is a direct result of this scale separation .",
