    "following those steps ,  was observed continuously during two 23 hour periods on 2015 march 10 and 2015 august 3 . during each period",
    ", we obtained 405 images with exposure times of 96.8 s at [ 4.5 ] , which were immediately followed by 405 images with exposures times of 93.6 s at [ 3.6 ] .",
    "these data were collected through astronomical observation requests 52667904 , 52668160 , 52668672 , and 52668928 within program 11056 ( k. luhman ) .",
    "we began our reduction of the data using the corrected basic calibrated data frames produced by the pipeline at the science center ( ssc ) .",

    "apex was used with the default parameters except for a 5@xmath65 pixel fitting region . because aperture photometry has been measured for most previous time - series data from irac",
    ", we also applied that method to our data for comparison to the results of prf fitting .",
    "the aperture photometry was measured with phot in iraf using an aperture radius of 1.5 pixels and a background annulus of 3 pixels , which was found to produce the least scatter in photometry for  relative to other annuli . to compare the data from prf fitting and aperture photometry in a given band",
    ", we calculated the median absolute deviation ( mad ) of the data and rejected outliers that deviated by @xmath11mad .",
    "we then fit the unrejected data using a nadaraya - watson regression estimator as implemented in the function npregbw from the _ np _ package @xcite within r @xcite . after dividing the data by that fit to remove intrinsic variability , we recomputed the mad .",
    "the mads from apex and phot were similar for [ 4.5 ] , but apex produced significantly lower values at [ 3.6 ] , where  is much fainter .",
    "we have investigated methods of correcting for systematic noise in our photometry due to the varying intra - pixel sensitivities .",
    "the ssc has measured high - resolution gain maps of the sweet spots for [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] , which can be used for such corrections . however , because  is much fainter at [ 3.6 ] than [ 4.5 ] , the uncertainties in its positions in individual frames are larger than the sweet spot of [ 3.6 ] and thus a correction for varying intra - pixel sensitivities was not possible in that band . at [ 4.5 ] , the positions of  drifted out of the sweet spot for roughly half of the first epoch , but they remained within it throughout the second epoch . as a result , the latter data were suitable for correction using the ssc s gain map . applying that correction required that we reduce those data a second time following the ssc s recommended procedure , which is performed with the idl routines box_centroider , aper , and pixel_phase_correct_gauss @xcite .",
    "the application of the gain map predicted a maximum change of @xmath12% and did not produce a lower mad or any noticeable change to the intrinsic variability compared to the uncorrected photometry from apex .",
    "we tested an alternative method of correcting for the varying intra - pixel sensitivity from @xcite and @xcite , but it also did not reduce the mads for either of the two epochs at [ 4.5 ] or alter the variability behavior .",
    "therefore , we have adopted the uncorrected photometry produced by prf fitting with apex for both bands and epochs .",
    "typical signal to noise ratios ( s / n ) for the those data are 10.2/146.8 and 10.9/142.3 for [ 3.6]/[4.5 ] in the first and second epochs , respectively .",
    "the apex data are listed in tables  [ tab:3.6 ] and [ tab:4.5 ] and are plotted as a function of time in figure [ fig : curve ] .",
    "we have omitted from figure [ fig : curve ] measurements that deviated by more than 3@xmath6mad from the nadaraya - watson regression that we calculated previously .    because irac is capable of measuring astrometry with high precision @xcite",
    ", it might seem possible to search for perturbations in the astrometry of  due to an unseen companion .",
    "however , for any plausible combination of orbital separation and mass ratio , the astrometric perturbations would be too small to detect during a 12-hour period given the the typical astrometric errors of 7  mas for  in individual [ 4.5 ] frames and additional systematic errors among those frames .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : curve ] ,  exhibits noticeable variability in both bands and epochs .",
    "for instance , the peak - to - peak amplitudes are 45% at both [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] in the first epoch .",
    "while the light curve of the first epoch appears semi - periodic in both bands , the shape does not follow a single - period sinusoid , which suggests that the mechanism producing the variability evolves on the timescale of hours or is spatially complex ( i.e. , several spots ) .",
    "the second epoch also shows variability in both filters but is less sinusoidal and has a lower amplitude ( 34% ) .",
    "the differences between the two epochs indicate that the light curve evolves on a timescale of months .",
    "these irac data have provided the third detection of variability in a ( likely ) y dwarf @xcite .",
    "the light curves for  are roughly similar to those of the previously studied y dwarfs in terms of amplitudes , but they are less periodic .",
    "in addition to our two epochs of time - series photometry ,  has been briefly imaged with _",
    "spitzer _ on several other occasions across a period of two years @xcite . among all of the available photometry , the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ]",
    "data have spanned ranges of @xmath40.16 and 0.13  mag , respectively .",
    "our attempts to identify a single rotational period for  have produced inconclusive results .",
    "the peaks in power in lomb - scargle periodograms @xcite appear at 6.8/9.3 and 9.0/5.3 hrs for [ 3.6]/[4.5 ] at the first and second epochs , respectively .",
    "we also fit the data in each band and epoch to a double sine model where the second sine has a period twice that of the first @xcite . while this model produces random residuals , indicating a good fit , the predicted periods are only consistent between epochs at the two sigma level .",
    "specifically , they have values of @xmath13/@xmath14 and @xmath15/@xmath16  hrs for [ 3.6]/[4.5 ] in the first and second epochs , respectively . @xcite",
    "successfully estimated a rotation period for a brown dwarf with a rapidly changing light curve with a more complicated model , but that model fails to converge on a solution for .",
    "additional time - series data would be needed to reliably measure the rotation period and the relative phase between the light curves of the two bands .",
    "because the spectra of cold brown dwarfs are non - planckian , different wavelengths can sample different pressure levels in the atmosphere . in the case of ,",
    "the similarity between the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] light curves at both epochs indicate that they may be sampling similar levels . however , without a measurement of a relative phase between the light curves of the two bands , it is difficult to make strong predictions about the structure of the atmosphere of .",
    "for example , an absence of a phase offset between bands would indicate that dynamical circulation is efficiently carrying thermal energy through these pressure levels .",
    "photometric variability in brown dwarfs could potentially arise from a number of spot - producing mechanisms , including magnetic activity , atmospheric chemical abundance variations , non - uniform cloud coverage , and variable temperature profiles causing hot / cold spots . in the following two sections , we discuss whether the variability of  can be explained by the latter two mechanisms .",
    "we have not considered the first two mechanisms because light curves have not been modeled for an atmosphere with heterogenous chemical abundances and because magnetically - induced starspots probably do not form in the neutral atmospheres of the coldest brown dwarfs , even in the presence of magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      if water clouds are present in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs as cold as , those clouds are likely to be patchy rather than uniform @xcite .",
    "to construct a self - consistent and stable model with non - uniform cloud coverage , @xcite computed emergent spectra for cloudy and clear atmospheric columns with a single temperature - pressure profile and then combined the fluxes ( @xmath17 ) from the two columns in the following manner : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fraction of the atmosphere without clouds @xcite .",
    "any deviation of @xmath19 between hemispheres from the global average of a model for  would produce photometric variability .",
    "in addition , these patchy cloud models predict substantially different emergent flux between the clear and cloudy columns at the two irac bands . for example",
    ", in figure [ fig : spec ] we show the spectra of both columns for a model brown dwarf with @xmath20=250 k , log @xmath21=4.0 cm s@xmath22 , @xmath23=3 and a cloud coverage of 50% ( @xmath19= 0.5 ) @xcitecmorley / cmorley / models.html . we have made use of the separate spectra from those columns , which were provided by c. morley . ] .",
    "the cloudy column exhibits much lower flux longward of @xmath43  @xmath10 m while the near - ir spectrum is affected less by the presence of water clouds . as a result , our irac observations are ideal for detecting photometric variability produced from water clouds .",
    "to test whether water clouds can produce the observed variability in , we follow the prescription of @xcite . using the @xmath19=0.5 model of figure [ fig : spec ]",
    ", we assumed that the cloud cover between hemispheres deviates from the global average by @xmath24 and calculated predicted fluxes for @xmath25 and @xmath26 from equation [ equ : cloudy ] .",
    "this deviation would produce variability with a semi - amplitude of @xmath27 } { \\rm{average } \\left [ f_{\\nu , h+\\delta h } ( \\lambda),f_{\\nu , h-\\delta h } ( \\lambda ) \\right ] } - 1.\\ ] ] in figure [ fig : cloud ] , we show the predicted semi - amplitudes at [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] as a function of @xmath24 for @xmath20=250 k , log @xmath21=4.0 cm s@xmath22 , cloud coverage of 50% , and @xmath28=3 , 5 and 7 .",
    "amplitudes in the two bands do not differ significantly for @xmath29 and increase linearly with increasing deviation from homogeneous cloud cover .",
    "we find that only a small deviation from a global average @xmath19 ( @xmath30 ) is needed to reproduce the observed amplitudes of variation in both bands for .",
    "although this model of patchy clouds is able to reproduce the observed variability of , it may not be the best explanation of those data , as discussed in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "a brown dwarf s photometric variability could be produced by temperature perturbations in its atmosphere , which would be manifested as time - varying hot and/or cold spots in the photosphere .",
    "such perturbations might occur if the atmosphere circulates faster than the gas can equilibrate or if the photosphere is radiatively coupled to changes at deeper pressure levels , such as deep heterogeneous clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite simulated the effect of the latter mechanism by injecting energy at various pressure levels into cloudless static models for brown dwarfs with temperatures of 4001000 k. @xcite performed the same exercise for 500  k in an attempt to reproduce the variability of .",
    "the two studies found that spots produce large variability in strong absorption features like the ch@xmath31 band within the [ 3.6 ] band , whereas the variability was smaller at wavelengths with less absorption , as in the case of [ 4.5 ] .",
    "in contrast ,  exhibits similar variability amplitudes in those two bands .",
    "thus , it appears unlikely that hot spots are the cause of its variability .",
    "previous studies have attempted to constrain the presence of water ice clouds in the atmosphere of  using photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite reported a possible 2.6  @xmath32 detection of  in a medium - band filter within the @xmath33 band .",
    "those data were used to place the object in a diagram of @xmath34 versus @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a band from the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _",
    "@xcite that is similar to [ 4.5 ] from _ spitzer_. the position of  in that diagram was better reproduced by cloudy models than cloudless models @xcite , which was interpreted as evidence of water ice clouds .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated that  was roughly midway between those cloudless and cloudy models in a similar diagram of @xmath37 versus @xmath38 $ ] , and that its position was best matched by cloudless models that employed non - equilibrium chemistry @xcite .",
    "after measuring photometry for  in several additional near - ir bands , @xcite and @xcite found that no single suite of models provided a clearly superior match to the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and that all of the models differed significantly from the data .",
    "thus , the photometry and models that are currently available do not provide any indication of whether water ice clouds are present in .",
    "a spectroscopic investigation of water ice clouds in  has been recently performed by @xcite .",
    "they obtained the only spectrum to date of the brown dwarf , which spans from 4.55.1  . although its resolution and s / n were low , the spectrum exhibited absorption features that appeared to be statistically significant , many of which coincided with features in model spectra computed by @xcite .",
    "the spectra predicted by cloudless and partly cloudy models were indistinguishable for the wavelength range and resolution of the data .",
    "the atmospheric temperature structure for a brown dwarf near the temperature of  does not converge with full coverage of water clouds @xcite , so @xcite developed a simplified model for that scenario , which used a gray , fully absorbing cloud with no specified composition .",
    "the cloud - top pressure in that model was varied to optimize the match to the observed spectrum .",
    "the resulting best - fit spectrum agreed somewhat better with the data than the spectra from the cloudless and partly cloudy models , which was cited as a detection of clouds .",
    "given the temperature of , it is expected that such clouds would be composed of water @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the spectrum from @xcite actually contains evidence of water clouds .",
    "the fully cloudy model from that study considered gray absorbers , whereas water ice is non - gray across the wavelength range of the spectrum of  @xcite , and it assumed that the cloud coverage is uniform , which is not expected for water clouds @xcite .",
    "in addition , models with patchy clouds have self - consistent temperature structures , which has not been possible for the fully cloudy models @xcite .",
    "given the variety of uncertainties in models of the coldest brown dwarfs @xcite and the large differences between the observed and predicted seds for  @xcite , the current models may not be sufficiently accurate for subtle differences in predicted spectra to provide meaningful insight into the physical properties of .",
    "our variability measurements can provide additional constraints on the existence of water ice clouds in the atmosphere of .",
    "according to the partly cloudy models of @xcite , cloud - induced variability at mid - ir wavelengths should become much larger ( for a given cloud covering fraction ) at temperatures below @xmath39  k with the onset of water clouds .",
    "the amplitudes that we have measured for  ( @xmath1  k ) are only a few percent , which would require very small deviations in cloud coverage between hemispheres ( @xmath40 ) if water clouds are responsible for the variability .",
    "meanwhile , the mid - ir amplitudes for  are similar to those observed for early y dwarfs ( @xmath41  k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and late t dwarfs ( 8001000  k , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which should be too warm to harbor water clouds . if water clouds are producing the variability of , then it must coincidentally have a value of @xmath24 that produces roughly the same amplitudes as the different variability mechanism that operates in those objects .",
    "alternatively , the similarity in the amplitudes of  and somewhat warmer brown dwarfs may indicate that they share a common origin for their variability ( i.e. , not water clouds ) .",
    "based on these results and the previous work that we have discussed , we conclude that robust evidence of water clouds in the atmosphere of  is not yet available .",
