    "cavity qed has become a standard tool of quantum optics .",
    "it allows the experimentalists to control both atomic and field variables to a high degree , and consequently the system can be utilized to explore many basic features of matter - field interactions . in the limit when the radiation - induced time scales are fast enough , we can neglect the various relaxation rates affecting the system , and then it can be used as a laboratory realization of the well known jaynes - cummings model .    in cavity qed physics ,",
    "the model has usually been introduced with time independent parameters .",
    "its utility is , however , preserved if we allow them to vary at a suitable rate .",
    "they should be fast compared with the relaxation processes of the system but slow enough not to destroy the mode structure of the cavity . in our works",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we have considered the new possibilities offered by such a model .    because the jaynes - cummings model separates into decoupled two - level systems , we advocated in reference @xcite that it may be used to design a filter mechanism to shape the photon distribution in the cavity into a desired form .",
    "there are earlier investigations into the effect on the cavity field caused by recording of the atomic state , see for example @xcite and @xcite , but we explore the possibilities deriving from time dependence of the coefficients . in reference @xcite , we consider the possibility that the desired effects may be derived simply from the shape of the eigenmodes of the cavity field .    in our earlier works , we have assumed that we record the state of every atom exiting the cavity after an interaction . in practical situations",
    ", however , the environment rapidly destroys the coherence between the atomic states after leaving the cavity , even when no measurement is performed . in this case the state of the field is reduced to one of its possible configurations without us knowing which one has occurred .",
    "we have a situation of nonselective measurements .",
    "after the passage of @xmath0 atoms through the cavity , our uncertainty about the actual state of the cavity becomes large .",
    "this , however , is just the situation to be described by a statistical ensembles of fields , each member occurring with a probability determined from the sequence of atomic reduction events which brought it about . in this paper",
    "we consider the evolution of the field in such a situation .",
    "the approach may be useful even if we , for some reason , do not want to record the results of the individual interaction sequence .",
    "in particular , we address the question of creating a pure fock state of the field in the cavity .",
    "this problem has been discussed before @xcite , but all methods tend to become difficult if one aims at large quantum numbers . our results may be considered to be a contribution to the discussion aiming at the creation of fock states .    in section [ jcmodel ] , we set up the problem and introduce the basic concepts . in section [ dkmod ]",
    "we specialize the hamiltonian to the solvable demkov - kunike model and discuss its properties in its adiabatic and non - adiabatic limits . in the former case we show that it is , ideally , possible to reach arbitrary @xmath1-states of the field . special cases of the latter situation have been discussed earlier @xcite and @xcite , and hence we only make a numerical investigation of the properties of the result specifically addressing the question of obtaining a fock - state . here",
    "the concept of trapping states @xcite becomes central , and we suggest a way to improve the method by velocity selection of the atoms sent into the cavity . in section [ conc ]",
    "we conclude the presentation with a discussion .",
    "we consider a system described by the jaynes - cummings model @xcite , which is the simplest formulation of the interaction between matter and a quantized field .",
    "the model assumes that the time of interaction is much shorter than other time - scales in the system , such as atomic and cavity field relaxation times .",
    "this means that atomic and field losses can be neglected during the interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian for the full system is @xmath2 @xmath3 where the @xmath4:s are the ordinary pauli matrixes and @xmath5 are the boson operators of the cavity mode . within this rotating wave approximation",
    ", the number of excitations is conserved ; the operator @xmath6 is a constant of motion .",
    "we therefore define the interaction hamiltonian @xmath7 , which separates the dynamics into two - level manifolds within the bare states .",
    "the state of the whole atom - field system can be expressed as @xmath8 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 are given by the schrdinger equation @xmath10 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{lll } \\displaystyle{\\frac{\\delta \\omega } { 2 } } &   & g\\sqrt{n } \\\\ &   &   \\\\",
    "g\\sqrt{n } &   & \\displaystyle{-\\frac{\\delta \\omega } { 2 } } \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{l } a_{+}(n ) \\\\ \\\\",
    "a_{-}(n ) \\end{array } \\right ] ,   \\label{two - ham}\\ ] ] here the detuning @xmath11 and the coupling @xmath12 are allowed to depend on time .",
    "initially , the atom is taken to be either in its upper or lower level @xmath13 and the initial field distribution is determined from @xmath14 .",
    "after the interaction , the atomic state is measured , and from equation ( [ init ] ) it follows that the initial state of the field is modified by @xmath15 or @xmath16 , depending on whether the atom is found in its upper @xmath17 or lower @xmath18 state .",
    "after @xmath0 atoms have passed through the cavity and been measured , the field is multiplied by a series of @xmath19:s .",
    "it is important to note , that the number of atoms detected in their upper and lower levels is not enough to tell what the state of the field is .",
    "one also needs the order of upper and lower detection events .",
    "this follows from the fact that , if the initial and final atomic states are different , then not only will the field be modified by @xmath19 , but the photon distribution will also be shifted by one unit .",
    "for example , if an initial lower level atom is found in its upper level after the interaction , the distribution of the field is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the initial photon distribution and @xmath22 a normalization constant .",
    "let @xmath23 be a vector denoting the sequence of measured atoms defined by : @xmath24 if the @xmath25:th atom s initial and final measured states have been flipped according to @xmath26 , and @xmath27 if they are the same .",
    "then @xmath23 uniquely determines the final photon distribution , provided that the initial state of the field is known .",
    "if we consider case ( b ) in equation ( [ initial ] ) and have , for example , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , that is the first atom is found in @xmath18 while the other two atoms are found in @xmath17 , then the final photon distribution will have the shape @xmath30    if @xmath31 , then the photon distribution after @xmath0 atoms can be written , in a compact form , as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the appropriate sequence of `` filter functions '' @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the normalization constant .",
    "if the field was initially in a fock state , then , whatever the filter functions are , the final field will also be in a fock state , shifted by an amount @xmath36 .",
    "if the initial conditions are as case ( a ) , the probability for measuring the atomic states @xmath37 , given a normalized photon distribution @xmath38 , is @xmath39 by repeatedly applying the equation above , we generate the probability @xmath40 of detecting the sequence @xmath23 , if the initial photon distribution is @xmath21 .",
    "note that this probability equals the normalization constant in equation ( [ dist ] ) @xmath41    now suppose that we perform a _ nonselective measurement _ of the atomic state , i.e. that is we do not record the final state of the atom .",
    "then the field is described by a density operator , obtained by tracing over the atomic degrees of freedom @xmath42 .\\ ] ] note that , if we only consider the diagonal elements , @xmath43 , we do not need the phases of the @xmath19:s .",
    "this @xmath44 is the ensemble photon distribution as will be explained below . for case ( a ) in equation ( [ initial ] )",
    ", the initial photon distribution is @xmath45 and , after @xmath0 nonselective measurements , the ensemble photon distribution is obtained from the recurrence relation @xmath46 a special case of this equation has been studied before , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is of essential importance to point out , that in general @xmath47 , for an arbitrary @xmath23 .",
    "the distribution given in ( [ avfot ] ) is the ensemble average over all possible outcomes @xmath48 @xmath49 where we have used equations ( [ dist ] ) and ( [ pronorm ] ) in the second step and @xmath50 defines the ensemble average over all possible @xmath23:s .",
    "if we consider cases with a fixed series of outcomes defined by a given @xmath23 , we have @xmath51 this happens if for example @xmath52 for any @xmath23 ; then this outcome has unit probability and is the only possible one , all other outcomes have zero probability .",
    "the only possibility that @xmath53 will describe a fock state exactly , is if all @xmath48 represent the same fock state . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath44 describes a fock state , this agrees with the actual state of the field .    with the above formalism , expectation values @xmath54 with respect to the distribution @xmath53",
    "are related to expectation values @xmath55 for the distribution @xmath48 according to @xmath56 for example , the variance @xmath57 of the distribution @xmath53 is given by @xmath58",
    "the hamiltonian in equation ( [ two - ham ] ) is in the most general form of a @xmath59 hermitian matrix @xcite , and has been widely investigated . for a review of analytically solvable time - dependent two - level systems see @xcite .",
    "here we only consider the demkov - kunike model , in which the two parameters of the hamiltonian are given by @xmath60 if we consider case ( a ) of equation ( [ initial ] ) and integrate over time @xmath61 , the filter functions become @xmath62    these expressions contain the three dimensionless parameters @xmath63 normally the adiabatic limit arises from large @xmath64 , or equivalently that , at least one of @xmath65 or @xmath66 becomes large . in the non - adiabatic limit @xmath67 . in the following we consider these two regimes separately .      with the parameters introduced in ( [ para ] )",
    "the filter functions may be written as @xmath68 for no photons , @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 .",
    "for @xmath71 the last term is an oscillating cosine - term in @xmath1 . in the adiabatic regime",
    ", either @xmath72 or @xmath73 becomes large , and since the denominator grows exponentially in these parameters , the oscillating cosine - term can be neglected .",
    "this means that , for photon numbers @xmath74 , the filter functions will become constant , determined by the first terms / term in ( [ filtf ] ) .",
    "then , if the parameters are chosen such that @xmath75 and at least one of @xmath72 or @xmath73 is large , we have to a good approximation @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "the number @xmath78 depends on the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "for example , if @xmath79 then @xmath80 or if @xmath81 ( the levels cross ) we have @xmath82 , while @xmath83 ( no level crossing ) gives @xmath84 . if there are non - adiabatic contributions , it is possible to have a @xmath78 that differs from the three cases given above .",
    "an important point is that , as long as the process is adiabatic , the @xmath85 cases are not sensitive to the parameters of the problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath80 case is sensitive to the condition @xmath86 .",
    "the filter function ( [ adfilt ] ) with @xmath80 can also be achieved by using a constant detuning @xmath87 and an asymmetric field coupling @xmath88 in the hamiltonian ( [ two - ham ] ) , see @xcite .    with the result ( [ adfilt ] )",
    ", the equation ( [ avfot ] ) becomes @xmath89 this equation can be solved by introducing a generating function @xmath90 the equation ( [ adfot ] ) then becomes @xmath91g_{m-1}(z),\\ ] ] having the solution @xmath91^mg_0(z).\\ ] ] with the field initially in a vacuum , @xmath92 , we find after @xmath0 atoms the state @xmath91^m=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\begin{array}{c } m \\\\ n\\end{array}\\right)\\kappa^{m - n}(1-\\kappa)^nz^n.\\ ] ] as the coefficient of @xmath93 is the photon probability distribution , we find @xmath94 @xmath53 is the form of a binomial distribution with a variance @xmath95    if @xmath82 we note that we have @xmath96 . from the discussion above , we know that if the ensemble state of the field is in a fock state then the real state of the cavity field is in the same fock state . in other words , after @xmath0 atoms has passed through the cavity , the state of the field , initially in vacuum , will be @xmath97 .",
    "a similar idea for producing a fock state has been presented in @xcite .",
    "physically , the process can be understood from the fact that as each atom traverses the cavity , it is tuned across the field - mode frequency in an adiabatic manner such that it exits the cavity in its lower state .",
    "then , after the passage , the mode will contain one extra photon . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the initial condition according to case ( b ) in equation ( [ initial ] ) instead , the mode will be left with one photon less .",
    "this holds for all initial distributions of the field @xmath98 obviously , case ( a ) will heat up the cavity mode , while case ( b ) cools it down .",
    "if lower level atoms are sent through the cavity , the field mode will eventually end up in the vacuum .",
    "the process can then be used as a `` field eraser '' @xcite . note that the result in equation ( [ erasure ] ) agrees with the one in ( [ dist ] ) .",
    "if the atomic and field - mode frequencies are on resonance ( @xmath99 ) , the filter functions are given by @xmath100 where the initial condition has been chosen according to case ( a ) .",
    "the ensemble distribution ( [ avfot ] ) , with the filter functions as in equation ( [ resonance ] ) , has been investigated in @xcite and @xcite , so we will not study it in great detail here . however , we specifically investigate its prospects to speed up the production of a fock state .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows how the distribution @xmath53 , initially in a coherent state with @xmath101 , evolve as the number of atoms @xmath0 increases .",
    "the filter functions are given by ( [ resonance ] ) with @xmath102 .",
    "we see how the distribution builds up around photon numbers @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "these @xmath105:s fulfill the trapping condition @xcite @xmath106 the corresponding states @xmath107 , fulfilling the trapping condition ( [ trap ] ) , are called trapping states and are labelled by @xmath108 .",
    "if the field is in a trapping state , then , since @xmath109 , all atoms will exit the cavity in their upper level and the state of the field is just multiplied by a phase - factor .",
    "the integer @xmath110 is the number of the corresponding maximum of @xmath111 , in other words the index of the trapping state . for a given trapping state @xmath108",
    ", there are @xmath112 other trapping states with photon numbers smaller than @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath110 also gives the number of rabi cycles during the interaction @xcite .",
    "when the atomic velocity can be controlled and consequently the effective interaction time @xmath113 , we may change the number of rabi cycles @xmath110 in the trapping state @xmath108 , since @xmath114 .    since @xmath115 for the trapping states , it is clear from ( [ avfot ] ) that the states @xmath116 are not coupled to the states @xmath117 .",
    "this results in a separation of the space @xmath118 into disconnected blocks ; population within one block will not leak into another .",
    "if @xmath110 is small , the distance between two consecutive trapping states is large , and may exceed the width of the initial photon distribution .",
    "then , if this distribution lies in one such block between two maxima of @xmath111 , it will eventually end up in the trapping state with the largest photon number @xmath105 . in this way",
    ", the situation allows us to create any fock state .",
    "however , using this method , the preparation of fock states with large photon numbers is difficult for two reasons :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      + the small curvature of the filter functions slows down the process , so if the curvature could be increased as the distribution approaches the trapping state , the number of atoms needed would be reduced .",
    "this can be achieved by changing the atomic velocity , and consequently the trapping state , in such a way that @xmath119 , where @xmath120 .    in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have plotted @xmath121 , when the initial state was a coherent one with @xmath122 . the solid line ( a ) gives the probability when all atoms have the same velocity , such that @xmath123 fulfills the trapping condition ( [ trap ] ) with @xmath124 .",
    "for the solid line ( b ) , the velocities of consecutive atoms are chosen such that @xmath110 is increased by one unit for each atom .",
    "starting with @xmath124 it means that the first atom has a velocity in which the state @xmath125 fulfills the trapping condition ( [ trap ] ) , and the velocity of the second atom is changed such that @xmath126 instead satisfies the condition .",
    "the trapping states thus occur according to @xmath127 for each atom",
    ". this sequence may not be the most efficient one , but it clearly shows how the process is speeded up .",
    "the other two lines ( dot - dash ) in figure [ fig2 ] describe the same processes as the ones above , but with a 2 @xmath128 gaussian random error in the effective interaction time @xmath64 .",
    "the error in @xmath64 clearly `` washes out '' the trapping condition as mentioned above .",
    "in this paper we have continued our investigation into the possibilities offered by letting the parameters of an atom - cavity system depend on time .",
    "it is essential that this variation is slow enough to retain the identity of the cavity modes and atomic states ; adiabatic changes are assumed . on the other hand , the interaction times considered have to be short enough that relaxation processes can be neglected .    in our earlier publications",
    "we have investigated how such time dependence combined with observation of the state of the outgoing atoms may be used as a photon state filter . choosing a suitable time variation ,",
    "desired photon states may be achieved . in this paper",
    "we continue the investigation by assuming reduction of the atomic state but no recording of the result .",
    "this may take place spontaneously or by special design .",
    "the result is , however , that knowledge about the cavity state is assembled into a density matrix , representing the ensemble of events compatible with the events having occurred . in general this conveys less information about the state than a selective measurement does .",
    "however , if the method can be used to prepare a pure fock state , the result becomes uniquely defined .",
    "the analysis utilizes a jaynes - cummings model with time dependent coefficients .",
    "this splits the problem into blocks that can be analysed separately . using the well known level crossing model presented by demkov and kunike",
    ", we may look separately at the adiabatic and non - adiabatic limits of this model .",
    "our numerical investigations suggests some scaling of the process :    in the adiabatic limit it takes @xmath1 atoms to prepare the @xmath129th fock state . in the non - adiabatic limit and",
    "with the trapping state fixed , the number of atoms grows with @xmath130 which may conflict with the requirement of no relaxations occurring .",
    "if , however , the consecutive atoms utilize consecutive trapping states , i.e. their velocities are fine tuned before entering the cavity , the number of atoms may be reduced to @xmath1 again .",
    "we have not been able to solve the general problem : given that we want to reach an arbitrarily chosen final photon state , is there a time dependence which guarantees this ?",
    "we have only illustrated the utility of the method for the preparation of a selected fock state .",
