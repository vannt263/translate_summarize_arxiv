    "microcavity polaritons are bosonic quasiparticles that appear in a semiconductor microcavity with an embedded quantum well ( qw ) when the cavity is tuned to an excitonic transition in the qw . in the last decade they have emerged as quasiparticles with many favorable properties for studying quantum optics and many - body physics in integrated photonic structures .",
    "bose - einstein condensation of polaritons and their superfluid properties have been investigated in detail both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the tunability of the polariton properties is often exploited .",
    "for example , the number of quantum wells is varied to change the rabi frequency ; etching , strain and surface acoustic waves have been used to create potentials for the polaritons .",
    "a tuning parameter that has received relatively little attention is the introduction of charges in the qw that interact with the polaritons . in the case of low charge concentration ,",
    "trionic bound states exist and a trionic polariton is observed @xcite .",
    "an experiment with high density modulation doping was performed by gabbay _",
    "they have shown that strong light - matter coupling is possible , even though neither an excitonic nor a trionic state could be resolved . from the theoretical side ,",
    "the mixed electronic - polaritonic system was proposed to reach superconductivity at higher temperatures , possibly even room temperature , thanks to a strongly attractive electron - electron interaction mediated by the polaritons @xcite . for what concerns the effect of the electron gas on the polaritons , various contributions both from the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite side",
    "have been made . here , the polariton quasiparticle itself was assumed not to be affected by the electron gas .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) on the single particle polariton properties .",
    "a first theoretical study on the modification of the single particle polariton properties due to the charges inside the quantum well started from an estimate of the oscillator strength computed in the context of the mahan singularity@xcite .",
    "indeed , the optical excitation of an electron gas ( metal or doped semiconductor ) is a central problem in many - body physics that was introduced by mahan @xcite and to which nozires , de dominicis @xcite and anderson @xcite made seminal contributions .",
    "they showed that the absorption becomes singular at the so - called fermi edge @xmath0 with some characteristic powerlaw : @xmath1 this fermi edge singularity is still an active topic of research that has recently attracted the attention of the community working on ultracold atomic gases @xcite . in this article , we will use a method by combescot and nozires@xcite to calculate fully numerically the electron gas optical susceptibility for all frequencies .",
    "therefore , we also have access to energies far away from the fermi edge singularity .",
    "the optical modes in a microcavity with an embedded quantum well are given by the photon spectral function @xmath2 , defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the retarded photon green s function with @xmath5 the energy of the bare cavity mode ( i.e. no quantum well inside ) . the momentum dependence is neglected , because photon momenta are always negligible as compared to the electron and hole momenta .",
    "cavity losses can be easily incorporated by giving @xmath5 an imaginary part .",
    "we prefer not to include them in our analysis , in order to highlight the polariton properties stemming from the electron - hole dynamics .",
    "the photon self energy due to interactions with the quantum well is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the latter quantity is nothing but the optical susceptibility of the 2deg inside the quantum well .",
    "the hybrid light - matter modes are thus found if we succeed in calculating @xmath6 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] the formalism for calculating the electron gas response function and the notations used in this paper are presented .",
    "section [ sec : spectra ] discusses the polariton single particle properties such as the polariton energies , linewidth , hopfield coefficients , effective mass and rabi splitting .",
    "the last section [ conclusionandoutlook ] gives a summary and outlook .",
    "following combescot and nozires@xcite ( cn ) , the optical response of the 2deg can be described as a sudden quench of the quiescent fermi sea of conduction electrons with a scattering potential , induced by the appearance of the valence band hole , at the time of excitation .",
    "the transient behaviour of the unperturbed single particle eigenstates in presence of this scattering potential determines the full optical response . within linear response theory and for a valence band hole with infinite mass , the optical susceptibility is given by @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the optical interband matrix element and @xmath9 are the creation operators for a conduction band electron , resp .",

    "@xmath10 is the usual time - ordering operator . the optical susceptibility @xmath11 in eq .",
    "is given by the laplace transform of the real time response function : @xmath12 upon neglecting electron - electron interactions , we assume for the initial state @xmath13 , i.e. before optical excitation , a slater determinant of single particle plane wave states @xmath14 .",
    "the response function can then be recasted into the form ( see ref . for details ) @xmath15 with @xmath16 \\label{eq : g}\\ ] ] @xmath17 , \\label{eq : l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the key quantity is the time - dependent matrix @xmath18 : @xmath19 this matrix @xmath18 contains the overlaps between the single particle plane wave states @xmath20 with energy @xmath21 ( units are such that @xmath22 and the bottom of the conduction band is chosen as the zero of energy ) before the transition , and the single particle scattering states satisfying @xmath23 , where the latter hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 due to its infinite mass , the valence band hole with energy @xmath25 acts as a static external single particle potential for the conduction electrons . in the above we assumed that the photon only couples to zero angular momentum states @xmath26 ,",
    "hence the summation indices in the above expressions are one - dimensional variables .",
    "physically , the separate terms appearing in the expressions and have the following interpretation ; eq .",
    "accounts for the dynamical self energy of the valence band hole .",
    "the first term in eq . represents the direct scattering of an electron above the fermi sea on the valence band hole potential while the second term denotes the indirect scattering .",
    "the latter is mediated by electrons inside the fermi sea.@xcite in the remaining part of this paper we work with a scattering potential that is separable in @xmath27-space , meaning @xmath28 with @xmath29 some form factor , which is the same choice as in cn . in particular",
    "we focus on the case of an attractive potential @xmath30 , for which it is known that in two dimensions this always results in the presence of a bound state . because of this particular choice we can check our numerical results against the analytical results found in cn .",
    "in the long time limit @xmath31 , cn analytically showed that the response function is given as a sum of two powerlaws : @xmath32 with @xmath33 some constants .",
    "the powerlaw decay is a manifestation of the so - called anderson orthogonality catastrophe@xcite which states that the many - particle wave functions with and without the presence of the scattering potential are orthogonal to each other .",
    "the scattering potential creates multiple low - energy intraband electron - hole pairs near the fermi level and as such , the overlap of the wave function before and after the optical excitation decreases with time as a powerlaw . for the optical absorption , there are two different thresholds : @xmath34 in a non - interacting picture , when filling up all single particle energy levels , the minimum energy required for absorption would be the fermi energy @xmath35 , i.e. the energy to put an electron into the lowest unoccupied state in the conduction band .",
    "however , after the appearance of the scattering potential an energy shift @xmath36 arises due to the filling of the new single particle energy levels @xmath37 . finally , also the energy level of the bound state @xmath38 should be added .",
    "this corresponds to the first threshold @xmath39 .",
    "the second threshold @xmath40 arises from the breaking up of the bound state ; the particle occupying the bound state energy level should be put on top of the fermi sea .",
    "this cost is @xmath41 and should be added to the first threshold .",

    "<S> a theoretical investigation of the single particle polariton properties for a microcavity embedding a charged quantum well is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the electron gas optical susceptibility is calculated numerically using the method devised by combescot and nozires . </S>",
    "<S> the role of many - body effects , such as the fermi edge singularity and anderson orthogonality catastrophe , in the polariton formation is elucidated . by tuning the light - matter coupling the short time behaviour of the electron gas response function </S>",
    "<S> is probed and comparison with earlier results only using the long time response are made . </S>",
    "<S> various single particle polariton properties such as the rabi splitting , line shape , hopfield coefficients and effective mass are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> these are experimentally accessible quantities and thus allow for a comparison with the presented theory . </S>"
