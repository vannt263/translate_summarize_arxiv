    "the standard model with three generations ( sm3 ) has been very successful in explaining all experimental results to date , in particular cp violation in the k- and b - meson systems is well understood , to an accuracy of about 15 - 20% , in terms of the ckm matrix of that theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , some  possible evidence \" for deviations from sm3 in b decays  @xcite is claimed . although these effects can be explained by several physics beyond the standard model  @xcite scenarios , the simplest viable explanation seems to be an extension of the standard model to 4 generations ( sm4 )  @xcite where the mass of the new heavy quarks is in the range 400 - 600  gev .",
    "if further studies in the b system continue to show deviations from the sm3 predictions , it may be difficult to resolve which extension of sm3 is responsible . the most direct way to determine",
    "the nature of the new physics which may be involved is to produce it `` on shell '' .",
    "indeed , hadron colliders , particularly the lhc , are ideally suited for this task . since the lhc generates a significant rate of parton interactions up to energies of @xmath11  tev it may be able to produce direct evidence of the new physics although this is not guaranteed in all cases .",
    "for instance , if the explanation lies in warped space ideas  @xcite then it appears that the relevant particles have to be at least approximately 3  tev  @xcite rendering their detection at lhc rather difficult  @xcite .",
    "if the new physics is an additional sequential fourth generation , there would be two new heavy quarks , a heavy charge + 2/3 quark ( @xmath2 ) and charge -1/3 quark ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "these quarks will be produced at the lhc predominantly by gluon - gluon fusions and should be produced at the lhc with appreciable rates  @xcite .",
    "for example at 10  tev center of mass energy cross - section for pair producing 500  gev quarks is large , @xmath4 1 pb , rising to around 4 pb at 14  tev and lhc experiments may well be able to study up to about 1  tev  @xcite , which is well above the perturbative bound  @xcite .",
    "we also note that experiments have already been searching for the heavier quarks and provided ( 95% cl ) bounds : @xmath5  gev ; @xmath6  gev  @xcite .",
    "these bounds are a little higher than the one quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite of @xmath7 gev ; @xmath8 gev at @xmath9 cl .    for the analysis to follow an important characteristic of the fourth generation quark doublet is that the mass splitting between the @xmath3- and @xmath2-quarks is constrained by electroweek precision tests to be small",
    ", likely less than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in addition to resolving the phenomenological hints of physics beyond sm3 that are alluded to in the above discussion , if a fourth generation is present , it may be helpful in explaining the long standing hierarchy problem within the sm .",
    "with very massive quarks in the new generation it has been proposed that electroweak symmetry breaking may well become a dynamical feature of the model  @xcite .",
    "another issue which is naturally addressed by the presence of a fourth generation is the origin of baryogenesis in the early universe .",
    "the tiny amount of cp violation allowed in the context of the ckm matrix of sm3 is much too small to supply the cp violation necessary for baryogenesis in the early universe .",
    "however , if a fourth generation is present , then there are two more additional phases in the ckm matrix .",
    "the effects of these new phases is significantly enhanced  @xcite by the larger masses of the new generation and so the natural cp violation of sm4 is perhaps large enough  @xcite to satisfy that sakharov  @xcite condition for baryogenesis .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite , however , that in the standard model with a fourth generation there might not be a first order phase transition hence it may still be the case that additional physics is required to satisfy that condition for baryogenesis .",
    "the presence of the two additional phases in the sm4 mixing matrix also can have many interesting phenomenological implications especially in observables that in sm3 are predicted to yield null results  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this paper we will consider the strategies for detecting fourth generation quarks at the hadron colliders .",
    "in section  [ decayrates ] we present the expressions for the decay distributions of the decay of a fourth generation quarks considering , in particular the energy spectrum of the lepton that is produced by the decay of such a quark .    in section  [ samples ]",
    "we discuss the various event samples which are most likely to be useful in obtaining signals of heavy quarks .",
    "in particular , we will consider signals consisting of multiple hard jets with missing momentum in combination with either one hard lepton , an opposite sign dilepton pair or a same sign dilepton pair .",
    "we also set out a set of basic cuts which are helpful in enhancing the signal with respect to the sm3 background .",
    "for each of the three kinds of event samples , we then discuss how the kinematics can be used to determine the mass of the heavy quark . in general a significant signal versus",
    "the background will be seen in a histogram of the reconstructed mass . in general",
    "we highlight two important challenges in reconstruction of the mass .",
    "first of all , in the presence of a large number of jets , there will be a potentially large combinatorial background ; secondly in some cases there are not enough kinematic constraints to reconstruct the neutrino momenta which make up the missing momentum . in the case of the same sign",
    "dilepton pairs the sm3 background is much smaller than the signal which arises in @xmath3-pair production thus an excess of high invariant mass same sign pairs is a clear signal for new physics in general and could be produced by @xmath3-quarks .    in section  [ backgrounds ]",
    "we discuss in detail the standard model ( i.e. sm3 ) backgrounds which contribute to the event samples while in section  [ summary ] we present our conclusions .",
    "let us now consider the main decay modes for the @xmath2- and @xmath3- quarks .",
    "a similar discussion is found in  @xcite and in @xcite the threshold effects at the interface between two body and three body decays are discussed .",
    "if the @xmath2 is more massive than the @xmath3 and the splitting is greater than @xmath0 then the main decay mode of the @xmath2 will be @xmath10 . if the splitting is less than @xmath0 then it can decay through the three body modes @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a virtual @xmath13 which either decays leptonically or hadronically .",
    "the heavy top can also decay through the two body mode to lighter quarks , @xmath14 etc .. as we shall show below , unless @xmath15 the two body mode will generally dominates over the three body mode . in this scenario",
    "the lighter @xmath3 should undergo a two body decay to u- or c - quarks with the relative branching ratios depending on the values of @xmath16 .",
    "if the @xmath2 is lighter than the @xmath3 ; the @xmath2 will decay via a 2 body mode to generation 1 - 3 quarks ; in analogy with the @xmath3 case above , the relative branching ratios depend on the values of @xmath17 .",
    "if the splitting is greater than @xmath0 , the @xmath3 will decay via @xmath18",
    ". if the splitting is less than @xmath0 the dominant decay mode might either be the three body mode @xmath19 or the two body mode to generation 1 - 3 quarks , @xmath20 depending on the value of @xmath21 .",
    "again , the two body mode will dominate unless @xmath22 .",
    "six scenarios for the complete decay chains of a fourth generation quark are thus possible depending on whether the relative mass of these quarks and the ckm matrix coupling to the lighter generations :    1 .   [ sca ] @xmath23 in which case @xmath24 and @xmath20 where @xmath25 ( with branching ratio depending on the ckm elements ) .",

    ", there is an important distinction between the case where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the @xmath38 case",
    "the quark will just manifest as a single jet while in the @xmath37 case , the top subsequently decays to @xmath39 and the @xmath13 may in turn decay leptonically or hadronically .",
    "the collider signature will thus depend on the nature of the @xmath13 decay .",
    "if the ckm matrix is not unitary ( i.e. the fourth generation is not a genuine sequential generation of the sm ) or if there is a further fifth generation ( thus rendering the @xmath40 ckm submatrix non - unitary ) then there are some possible modifications to the above scenarios .",
    "if @xmath41 is small , then in scenarios [ sca ] and [ scd ] it might not be the case that @xmath10 or @xmath42 are the dominant decay modes and these cases will resemble scenarios [ scb ] and [ sce ] respectively .    in the case @xmath26 where @xmath27 is small enough to suppress the two body decay mode as in scenario [ scc ] , it could happen that @xmath43 for @xmath25 is sufficiently large that the mode @xmath44 becomes important . if the @xmath40 ckm matrix is unitary then :    @xmath45",
    "therefore a large @xmath46 will imply a large @xmath27 for some @xmath47 or @xmath48 and so the two body mode must dominate .",
    "the analogous argument also applies for the decay @xmath49 in scenario [ scf ] .",
    "let us now consider the two body decay of a heavy quark @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a fourth generation quark and @xmath52 is either the other fourth generation quark or a 1 - 3 generation quark .",

    "when a @xmath3 pair is produced , the matrix element and the structure functions tend to drive it to lower @xmath88 .",

    "if the @xmath3 is at rest , we can develop an analytic expression for the energy spectrum of this lepton .",
    "it is useful to divide the spectrum into three segments by the energies :    @xmath93    where    @xmath94    the energy spectrum is thus    @xmath95    where    @xmath96    and    @xmath97    and @xmath98",
    "in order to find evidence for heavy quark pair production at hadronic colliders , we use the decay scenarios discussed above to suggest which signals should be searched for . in this discussion",
    "we would like to highlight three issues which lead to acceptance cuts that apply all the signal classes we consider .",
    "first of all , we will introduce a set of basic cuts which will preserve the signal but reduce the sm background to a manageable level ( about @xmath99 signal ) .",
    "next , we will consider extracting a reconstructed @xmath100 from the kinematics of the events that pass the basic cuts .",
    "we will see that a histogram in the reconstructed @xmath100 generally separates the signal from background and allows the determination of the heavy quark mass . in order to most effectively use this method , however",
    ", it is useful to reduce the combinatorial background , particularly if the signal consists of a large multiplicity of jets .",
    "as we will show , this combinatorial background can be greatly reduced due to the fact that most of the jets are in pairs resulting from w - boson decay .",
    "let us first consider the possible heavy quark decay modes and then turn our attention to the analysis of the cases which are likely to be of greatest experimental interest .",
    "in general , if we assume that the heavy quark decays dominantly through a two body decay mode , the net decay of the heavy quark will be to a light quark plus 1 - 3 of w - bosons    if @xmath101 is the heavy quark ( either a @xmath2- or @xmath3- quark ) and @xmath102 one of the five lightest quarks @xmath103 , the decay chain will assume one of the following forms :    @xmath104    in particular , decay channel ( 1 ) occurs when a @xmath2 decays to a @xmath48 , @xmath105 or @xmath106 quark and a w - boson or when a @xmath3 decays to a @xmath107 or @xmath108 and a w - boson .",
    "case ( 1 ) would be the dominant @xmath3 decay mode in the mixing scenario where @xmath109 was much smaller than @xmath110 and/or @xmath111 .",
    "conversely , the @xmath3 quark will decay dominantly through decay channel ( 2 ) if the first decay in its cascade is @xmath112 where the top quark then decays to @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath2 could also decay through a channel like this in the scenario where @xmath114 and the @xmath3 decayed through channel ( 1 ) , thus @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "decay channel ( 3 ) would apply if the @xmath2 cascaded down to the @xmath3 which in turn decayed via channel ( 2 ) . thus @xmath117 .",
    "if the mixing between the fourth and third generations is sufficiently small and the quark mass splitting is less than @xmath0 then two other decay modes involving three body decay channels may be important :    @xmath118    ( @xmath12=virtual w - boson ) where in channel ( 4 ) @xmath101 is the heavier fourth generation quark and @xmath119 is the lighter fourth generation quark .",
    "since the fourth generation quark @xmath101 is pair produced , depending on which of the channels above controls the decay , there are potentially up to 6 w - bosons plus 2 light quark jets in the final state .",
    "if all those w - bosons decayed hadronically , that would result in a final state with up to 14 jets . in any case",
    "the qcd background to a purely hadronic final state is likely overwhelming so we must consider cases where at least one of the w - bosons decays leptonically .",
    "in particular , we will consider the prospect of signals where one or two of the w - bosons decay leptonically .",
    "in such a case , the signal will be a final state with one or two hard lepton(s ) and significant missing momentum .    depending on which of the channels 1 - 5 is dominant for each quark species",
    ", it is not unreasonable to suppose that signals of this type will received contributions from both species of quarks .",
    "this is a natural situation if the two species are roughly degenerate and so both @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks will be produced at roughly comparable rates , especially if the masses of the @xmath3- and @xmath2-quarks are around 400 - 600  gev and the collisions are at lhc energies , @xmath120  tev .",
    "such a state of affairs can be helpful in building a signal indicating a fourth generation even before the individual contributions from @xmath2 and @xmath3 are separately identified .",
    "the case where one or two w - bosons decay leptonically therefore leads to three signal channels for the fourth generation of quarks .",
    "we will consider the signals in each of these channels in order to determine the signal to background ratio and how the signal may be used to reconstruct the mass of the quark .",
    "these issues are related in that the difference in kinematics between sm backgrounds and the heavy quark signals means that if the mass of the quark can be reconstructed , this will provide a good mechanism for separating signals from background .",
    "the three event samples which we consider are as follows :    1 .",
    "single lepton sample : the signature of this sample is @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a lepton , either @xmath123 or @xmath124 , @xmath125 means @xmath126 jets and @xmath127 means missing transverse momentum .",
    "2 .   like sign di - lepton sample : the signature of this sample is @xmath128 3 .",
    "opposite sign di - lepton sample : the signature of this sample is @xmath129 .",
    "note that for some of the potential sm backgrounds , it might be helpful to consider @xmath130 .",
    "only heavy quarks that cascade to at least two w - bosons will contribute to this sample .    in our analysis we will consider mainly the scenario where the splitting between the two heavy quark masses is less than @xmath0 and the ckm element between the fourth generation quarks and lighter quarks is large enough that the dominant decay mode is the two body decay to lighter quarks .",
    "thus the decay modes for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks we are mainly considering are :    @xmath131    which are the modes that apply if the dominant mixing of the fourth generation is with the third .",
    "the analysis we carry out however easily generalizes to the case where this assumption is weakened .",
    "thus if the decay in fact proceeds through    @xmath132    the kinematics in these cases will be identical to the @xmath2 decay to @xmath113 and so the analysis we discuss below will apply to all of these cases .",
    "in addition , if b - tagging can be carried out then we can distinguish the @xmath113 final state from @xmath133 .    for our event analysis we first generated the signal and background events with the aid of madgraph  @xcite and",
    "later interfaced these to pythia6  @xcite for further analysis including decays of the top and w s .    for the @xmath101-pair event generation",
    ", we wrote the madgraph model files to incorporate the @xmath134 and @xmath135 and their interactions .",
    "we use cteq6l  @xcite to evaluate parton densities .",
    "the renormalization scale , @xmath136 , and the factorization scale , @xmath137 are fixed at    @xmath138    jet formation has been done using default pythia scheme implemented through pycell .",
    "we also incorporate effects of initial state radiation ( isr ) and final state radiation ( fsr ) using the same simulation package .",
    "the basic cuts that apply in these tables on leptons , @xmath139 and , jets , j ( including b s ) which consists of    * lepton should have @xmath140  gev and @xmath141 , to ensure that they lie within the coverage of the detector .",
    "* jets should have @xmath142  gev and @xmath143 * spatial resolution between _ lepton - lepton _ , _ lepton - jet _ , and , _ jet - jet _ should be @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 respectively , ( where @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) , such that the leptons and jets are well separated in space . * a missing transverse energy cut , @xmath150 to enhance the likelihood that leptons are due to @xmath13 decay .",
    "in addition to the cuts mentioned above , we apply the following cuts to reduce the background further :    * a minimum cut on the scalar sum of transverse momenta ( @xmath151 ) of the final state lepton , jets , and the missing transverse energy of 350  gev .",
    "@xmath151 is defined to be : + @xmath152    .",
    "number of signal and background events for a number of scenarios . in each case",
    ", the three numbers indicate the single lepton ; opposite sign dileptons ( osd ) and same sign dileptons ( ssd ) events from the @xmath2- and @xmath3-pair production at the lhc for @xmath153 14 , 10 and 7  tev and @xmath154 fb@xmath155 without the requirement of isolation on jets .",
    "the basic cuts are : @xmath156  gev , @xmath157 ; @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     clearly the jets or lepton arising due to the background processes will be relatively softer than our signal .",
    "therefore , with the demand of higher transverse momentum jets and leptons or alternatively a higher scalar sum of transverse momentum of visible final state particles and the missing transverse energy , @xmath151 will reduce the background considerably as shown in tables  [ big - table-1a ] and  [ big - table-2a ] for each case .",
    "extending the standard model by adding a fourth fermion generation may be helpful in understanding how electro - weak symmetry breaking works and possibly also in elucidating the mechanism of baryogenesis in the early universe .",
    "the lhc will pair produce fourth generation quarks at a relatively high rate if their mass is in the range 400600  gev .",
    "decay channels which result in final states with one or two leptons provide signals which have only modest standard model backgrounds .    in this study we considered the case where fourth generation quarks decay predominantly to quarks from the first three generations assuming that the mass splitting between the fourth generation quarks is small .",
    "this is likely the decay mechanism of the lightest fourth generation quark and also could be the decay mode for both of the heavy quarks .",
    "for such a quark we investigated the signals and backgrounds in three different channels : ( 1 ) single lepton plus jets and missing momentum ; ( 2 ) opposite sign dilepton pair plus jets and missing momentum and ( 3 ) same sign dilepton pair plus jets and missing momentum . in all cases ,",
    "we first consider a basic set of cuts which eliminates a large portion of the background but generally leaves the signal intact . to further isolate the signal we use the kinematics of the event to reconstruct the heavy quark mass .    in the case of a single lepton plus jets and missing momentum",
    ", we can use the fact that the missing momentum arises form a single neutrino which is associated with the lepton in the decay of a w - boson .",
    "this constraint over determines the kinematics once the role of the jets is correctly assigned .",
    "in particular one can extract independently a mass for the heavy quark both from the hadronic and leptonic sides of the event .",
    "we find that the combinatorial background from the many possible jet assignments can be greatly reduced if you accept only the jet assignment which minimizes the discrepancy between the two mass determinations .",
    "other cuts which are helpful in reducing the combinatorial background are a cut on @xmath151 and a cut on @xmath160 which tends to force jet pairs which arise from the decay of a single @xmath13 boson to be assigned to the same side of the event .",
    "if the single lepton event arises from the decay of a heavy quark to a light quark other than the top ( i.e. which we have generally taken to be a @xmath2 in our discussion ) , there are a total of four jets in the final state so the combinatorial background is not particularly severe .",
    "if , however a @xmath3 quark decays to a @xmath59 final state , then there are eight jets in total and the combinatorial background may pose a problem for quarks in the heavier mass range .",
    "thus we have considered what mass resolution is required in order to satisfactorily implement the minimum @xmath161 selection of the correct jet assignment .",
    "in the case of an opposite sign dilepton pair , if the heavy quark does not decay to a top quark , there are only 2 jets so there is no large combinatorial background ; however , the kinematics of such events is underdetermined so the quark mass can not precisely be extracted on an event by event basis .",
    "but if we make the approximation that the two heavy quarks are at rest in their center of mass frame , we can deduce roughly the heavy quark mass which evidently separates the signal from the background well enough to provide a prominent signal and determine the heavy quark mass .",
    "in the case where a @xmath3 decays to @xmath59 there are three cases which could apply depending on whether 0 , 1 or 2 of the leptons arise from top decay . for each lepton which arises from top decay",
    "there is an additional constraint on the momentum of the associated neutrino ; therefore , in these scenarios the kinematics is either under determined , critically determined or over determined respectively . for a given event we do not initially know which of these scenarios applies , however , if we iterate over the three scenarios and all jet assignments , most of the wrong assignments lead to unphysical neutrino momenta so that retaining the cases which can be reconstructed we produce a satisfactory signal and reconstruction of the heavy quark mass .",
    "the same sign dilepton signal only arises in the scenario where @xmath162 and results in kinematics where the neutrino momenta are critically determined .",
    "this channel has the advantage that the standard model background is negligible . as in the opposite sign case",
    ", we can resolve the combinatorial background by taking only cases where there are physical solutions for the neutrino momenta and thus obtain the heavy quark mass .",
    "thus the mass of the heavy quark may be determined by the kinematic reconstruction or through the characteristics of the invariant mass distribution of the dilepton pair .",

    "<S> although there is no compelling evidence , at present , against the standard model ( sm ) , in the past few years , a number of 2 - 3 sigma tensions have appeared which could be alleviated simply by adding another generation of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a fourth generation could help resolve the issue of baryogenesis and the understanding of the hierarchy problem .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the phenomenology of the fourth generation heavy quarks which would be pair produced at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if such a quark with a mass in the phenomenologically interesting range of 400  gev600  gev decays to a light quark and a w - boson , it will produce a signal in a number of channels which can be seen above the background from the three generation standard model processes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , such quarks could be seen in channels where multiple jets are present with large missing momentum and either a single hard lepton , an opposite sign hard lepton pair or a same sign lepton pair .    in the same sign dilepton channel </S>",
    "<S> there is little background and so an excess of such pairs at large invariant mass will indicate the presence of heavy down type quarks . more generally , in our study , the main tool we use to determine the mass of the heavy quark in each of the channels we consider is to use the kinematics of the decay of such quarks to resolve the momenta of the unobserved neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we show how this can be carried out , even in cases where the kinematics is under - determined by use of the approximation , which holds quite well , that the two heavy quarks are nearly at rest in the center of mass frame .    since it is very likely that at least the lightest heavy quark decays in the mode we consider , this means that it should be observed at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is expected that the mass splitting between the quarks is less than @xmath0 so that if the cabbibo - kobayshi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element between the fourth and lower generations are not too small , both members of the fourth generation quark doublet will decay in this way . </S>",
    "<S> if this is so , the combined signal of these two quarks will make the signal for the fourth generation somewhat more prominent .    </S>",
