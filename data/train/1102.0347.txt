    "the introduction of ccd detectors to photometric studies of open clusters has led to significant improvements in the accuracy and precision of data for faint cluster stars observed previously via photoelectric or photographic techniques .",
    "the tradeoff is a low efficiency and associated steep wavelength dependence for such detectors in the blue - violet region , limiting photometric accuracy in the traditional ultraviolet filters : the johnson system _ u_-band and the strmgren system _ u_-band .",
    "color corrections for observations in the ultraviolet become non - linear and multi - valued in that situation , particularly for hot stars that display a sizable balmer discontinuity superposed on their continuum ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "many recent open cluster studies have therefore been restricted to observations in the _ bvri _ bands , or simply the _ bvi _ or _ vri _ bands .",
    "the intrinsic relations for ob stars and gk dwarfs in color - color diagrams restricted to such systems are nearly parallel to the reddening vectors for interstellar extinction @xcite , posing difficulties for establishing the reddening of cluster stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "af stars can be studied in such fashion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but that would limit photometric studies in _ bvri _ to intermediate - age clusters with their main sequences consisting of unevolved 12 @xmath1 stars .",
    "even in such cases , an accurate knowledge of the interstellar reddening of member stars is essential for the reliable establishment of distance and age @xcite , which means that the photometric study of many clusters may be limited by the nature of the filter bands employed for the observations .",
    "some researchers studying intermediate - age and old clusters have therefore adopted an alternate approach to establish cluster intrinsic parameters , by identifying a putative red giant clump in cluster color - magnitude diagrams arising from the he - burning stage of low - mass red giants @xcite and inferring the reddening , age , and distance of a cluster through optimized fitting of model isochrones to the data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are two problems associated with such an approach .",
    "first , the dependence of the fitting technique on model isochrones may bias the results .",
    "second , the most frequently encountered stars along most galactic lines of sight tend to be k giants and a dwarfs @xcite , which are also the most luminous members of intermediate - age open clusters .",
    "as noted by @xcite , simulations of _ ubv _ photometry for unrelated stars lying in typical galactic star fields can generate color - magnitude diagrams containing pseudo - main sequences similar to those of true open clusters .",
    "the presence of physically - unrelated a dwarfs and k giants along typical galactic lines of sight may therefore generate features in open cluster color - magnitude diagrams , a dwarfs and g giants or fg dwarfs and k giants , in similar locations to those found in the color - magnitude diagrams of intermediate - age or old open clusters , respectively . the photometric properties of foreground or background stars in some open cluster fields could therefore be mistaken for the characteristics of an old open cluster color - magnitude diagram , thereby biasing studies of clusters tied to the red clump method .",
    "an independent means of establishing cluster membership ( e.g. , star counts , proper motions , or radial velocities ) and especially reddening for cluster stars is therefore essential for avoiding incorrect conclusions about cluster parameters",
    ". the ready availability of _",
    "jhk_@xmath0 photometry @xcite from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for galactic star fields offers one such means , since it addresses the primary parameter vital for open cluster studies : the amount of foreground reddening of cluster stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "presented here are examples of star clusters , berkeley 44 , turner 1 , and collinder 419 , for which the method addresses potential incorrect choices of cluster parameters based solely on optical photometry .",
    "the effective wavelengths for the 2mass _ jhk_@xmath0 system , 1.235 @xmath3 m , 1.662 @xmath3 m , and 2.159 @xmath3 m , respectively , are fairly close to those for the older _ jk _ system of @xcite and the _ jhk _ system studied by @xcite , and observations with the _ jhk _ and _ k_@xmath0 filters are standardized in fairly similar fashion .",
    "the main source of difficulty is likely to be the presence of atmospheric absoprtion features within the same photometric bands @xcite , which reduces the precision of repeated observations .",
    "_ k_@xmath0-band observations , and possibly _",
    "h_-band observations , of stars are also suceptible to emission from circumstellar dust . is it possible that the intrinsic _ vjk _ and _ vjhk _ colors for main - sequence stars derived by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , are also applicable to the 2mass _ jhk_@xmath0 system ?",
    "such a possibility can be tested from available 2mass observations of standard stars and stars in open clusters of known reddening .        intrinsic _",

    "the _ ubv _ colors display _ no _ differential reddening , so it is unlikely to appear in the _ jhk_@xmath0 colors unless there is some unforeseen component , such as circumstellar emission , affecting the observations . a pronounced `` extra '' scatter for b - type stars may have such an origin , given the evidence for circumstellar dust associated with some rapidly - rotating late b - type stars @xcite , but it is unlikely that similar effects extend to the remaining cluster stars .",
    "it is more reasonable to attribute the scatter to intrinsic uncertainties in the precision of the _",
    "jhk_@xmath0 magnitude estimates , which appear to be larger than the cited values and also larger than what is attainable from iris photometry of photographic plates @xcite .",
    "the tendency toward larger scatter for the coolest stars of ngc 2362 and ngc 2281 may be a problem with membership selection .    an earlier calibration similar to that of table  [ tab1 ] was derived using stars in stock 16 , ngc 2362 , and ngc 2251 , with polynomial and linear fits made to combined running 20-point means for the data .",
    "some of the features of the earlier calibration ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) can be seen in the lower right portion of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , namely the pronouned `` kink '' near spectral type a0 in the mean data .",
    "but the data also match the new curved relationship very well .    for hyades stars",
    "the _ jhk_@xmath0 observations represent a combination of both 2mass data and data from @xcite , as noted .",
    "the colors from both data sets display a similar scatter to that for stock 16 and ngc 2244 members , but is much reduced when the data are averaged together .",
    "there remains a sizeable residual scatter that is slightly larger than the cited uncertainties in the observations .",
    "perhaps it represents an observational limitation for ground - based observations in the infrared imposed by variable atmospheric water vapour content ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the scatter is greatly reduced in the 20-point running means , which is consistent with a problem that is tied to the precision of the observations .",
    "otherwise , the intrinsic relation of table  [ tab1 ] appears to be confirmed .    the colors for cluster stars in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] agree closely with the derived intrinsic relation , in most cases displaying only random scatter about it .",
    "if there were an extra reddening component of , say , 0.01 to 0.02 in _",
    "h ) _ for the stars , the centroids for the data would display a noticeable offset from the intrinsic relation .",
    "thus , despite large scatter in the colors for stars in many open clusters , it is possible to derive an observational reddening for the stars from a color - color diagram by eye , with uncertainties of no more than @xmath10 to @xmath11 in _ e(j  h ) _ , provided that the scatter in such cases is random in nature . likewise , distance moduli derived from observational _ j _ versus _ j  h _ color - magnitude diagrams can be derived by eye with uncertainties typically no larger than @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "such conclusions are confirmed by tests on the many open clusters studied to date ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as noted above , the intrinsic relations of table  [ tab1 ] have been tested successfully previously @xcite , but three clusters of uncertain properties were selected for further testing here : berkeley 44 , turner 1 , and collinder 419 .",
    "all three clusters possess limited published optical observations , and provide good examples of where 2mass observations may help to clarify previous conclusions about cluster properties .              the sparse northern hemisphere cluster berkeley 44 ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) has been identified as an old group by @xcite , although with some question about its reality because of ambiguities in the star counts and the similarity of its color - magnitude diagram to that of stars in the surrounding reference field .",
    "the published co - ordinates for the cluster by @xcite and @xcite do not match the optical density peak visible on the palomar observatory sky survey , and an alternate cluster center ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) was adopted here .",
    "the group lies more than @xmath14 from the galactic plane , so contamination by foreground early - type stars should be relatively low .",
    "however , the extreme faintness of cluster stars makes it necessary to consider both high quality and low quality 2mass data for the field , with uncertainties of @xmath15 representing the demarcation .",
    "the 2mass _ jhk_@xmath0 data for berkeley 44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) confirm that it is an old open cluster .",
    "the cluster color - color diagram is devoid of early - type stars lying within @xmath16 of the adopted cluster center , most cluster members being cooler late - type stars .",
    "a few stars of inferred spectral types g and k appear to be essentially unreddened , with most stars of spectral types f or later reddened by similar amounts .",
    "the cluster color - magnitude diagram reveals a well - defined clump of red giants at @xmath17 with implied spectral types of early k , so the identification of this cluster as an old cluster is confirmed .",

    "berkeley 44 main - sequence members have intrinsic _ j  h _ colors of @xmath24 or redder , indicating stars of earliest spectral type @xmath25f0 , corresponding to turnoffs for intermediate - age clusters of age @xmath26 yrs .",
    "a variety of model isochrones near @xmath27 were therefore tested in the cluster color - magnitude diagram ( fig .",
