    "in this section we specify the partial classification theorem 2.9 .",
    "this finally allows us to prove the main theorem .",
    "more precisely , we study the local cr - equivalence relations among the surfaces ia - vii . to do so ,",
    "we firstly give the following definition .",
    "* definition 3.1 . * a totally non - degenerate locally homogeneous 4-dimensional cr - manifold @xmath1 is called _ spherical , if at some point ( and hence at each point ) it is locally cr - equivalent to the cubic @xmath47 .",
    "otherwise @xmath1 is called _ non - spherical . _",
    "the term `` spherical '' is used in analogue with the case of a hypersurface in @xmath14 , where the 3-dimensional sphere is the model surface for the class of levi non - degenerate hypersurfaces @xcite . using the trichotomy for 4-dimensional locally homogeneous cr - submanifolds in @xmath0 ( see introduction ) , we get the following proposition .    * proposition 3.2 . _",
    "_ * two non - spherical 4-dimensional totally non - degenerate locally homogeneous cr - submanifold @xmath278 are locally cr - equivalent if and only if there exists a biholomorphic mapping @xmath276 , translating a point @xmath3 to a point @xmath279 and ( locally ) translating the algebra @xmath280 into the algebra @xmath281 . in particular , if @xmath278 are cr - equivalent , then @xmath282 are isomorphic as lie algebras .",
    "it follows from the above proposition that for non - spherical manifolds the local cr - equivalence problem can be reduced to the biholomorphic equivalence problem for vector field algebras , providing the homogeneity of the manifolds .",
    "hence it is important now to find out what surfaces in the extended list ia - vii are spherical .",
    "we firstly note that the sphericity of via with @xmath283 follows from @xcite .",
    "the sphericity of ic for @xmath284 can be verified from the previous fact by applying the binomial formula for @xmath285 . to do the sphericity check for the other surfaces , we refer to the sphericity criterion , formulated in @xcite . according to this criterion , a 4-dimensional totally non - degenerate locally homogeneous cr - manifold @xmath1 is spherical",
    "if and only if in some local coordinates @xmath286 it can be presented as @xmath287 where the variables are assigned the weights @xmath288=1,[w_2]=2,[w_3]=3 $ ] and @xmath289 are terms of weights grater than 6 and 7 correspondingly ( this is some analogue for the sphericity criterion for a hypersurface in @xmath113 , see @xcite,@xcite ) . to apply this criterion to the above list of homogeneous surfaces , we consider all possible holomorphic transformations , preserving the origin , and present them as @xmath290 where @xmath291 are polynomials of weight @xmath292 .",
    "we call the collection of all @xmath293 for @xmath294 _ the @xmath295-jet of the transformation . we also present the manifold as @xmath296 where @xmath297 are polynomials of weight @xmath292 and call the collection of all @xmath298 for @xmath299 _ the @xmath300 jet of @xmath1",

    "then it is clear that the vanishing condition for the @xmath304-jet of the manifold ( which is equivalent to the sphericity ) is a condition on the @xmath305-jet of the mapping .",
    "this condition is a system of equations on the coefficients of the @xmath305-jet of the mapping . _",
    "_            * step 2*. we write the condition on the coefficients of a mapping @xmath310 which maps the surface , obtained in step 1 , onto a surface @xmath311 this condition is a system of 26 real equations on 24 real variables , which might not have any solution .",
    "if this system has no solution , then we conclude that the surface is not spherical .",
    "otherwise we get a solution @xmath312 and go to step 3 .",

    "vi it is possible to apply simpler arguments .",
    "we resume the results of our computations in the following proposition .",
    "* proof.*to prove the proposition for the tube surfaces via - vii we note the following : the subalgebra @xmath315 is the unique abelian 3-dimensional subalgebra in the 5-dimensional infinitesimal automorphism algebra of the cubic @xmath47 ( it can be easily verified from the commuting relations in the algebra , see @xcite for the details and the notations ) . as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the cubic @xmath47 is polinomially equivalent to the tube surface @xmath316 for @xmath283 ( we denote this surface by @xmath317 ) and we conclude that @xmath318 is the unique 3-dimensional abelian subalgebra in @xmath319 .",
    "hence if a tube surface @xmath1 from the list via - vii is locally biholomorphically equivalent to the cubic @xmath47 , we get a biholomorphic mapping @xmath276 , which maps @xmath112 to a 4-dimensional subalgebra of the 5-dimensional algebra @xmath319 .",
    "in particular , the abelian 3-algebra , spanned by @xmath118 , is mapped to an abelian 3-dimensional subalgebra of @xmath319 . since",
    "such subalgebra is unique , we conclude that @xmath276 maps the three coordinate vector field @xmath320 to their linear combinations , which implies that @xmath276 is in fact a linear mapping . hence all the tube surfaces via - vii except @xmath317 are locally biholomorphically non - equivalent to @xmath47 , as required .",
    "it remains now to prove that the non - spherical homogeneous surfaces ia - vii are pairwise locally cr - inequivalent . since homogeneous surfaces of different types ia - vii correspond to non - isomorphic lie algebras ( except the cases va , vb , corresponding to the same algebra v ) , we just need to prove , using proposition 3.2 , that two vector field algebras , providing the homogeneity of two non - spherical surfaces of the same type ia - vii , can not be mapped onto each other by a local biholomorphic mapping and also to prove that two vector field algebras , providing the homogeneity of a type va surface and a type vb surface correspondingly , can not be mapped onto each other by a local biholomorphic mapping . in what follows @xmath321",
