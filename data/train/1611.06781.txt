    "this non - locality has also been used to show that even a tiny amount of free - randomness can be amplified @xcite and that extensions of quantum theory which incorporate a particular notion of free - choice can not have better predictive power than quantum theory itself @xcite .",
    "the quantum non - local correlations are known to be fully compatible with the no - signaling principle , i.e. , the space - like separated parties can not use the non - local correlations to communicate superluminally @xcite .",
    "since the proposal of popescu and rohrlich @xcite , it has been realized that non - local correlations might take on a more fundamental aspect .",
    "not only quantum theory but any future theory that might contain the quantum theory as an approximation is now expected to incorporate non - locality as an essential intrinsic feature . this program has led to the formulation of device - independent information - theoretic principles @xcite that attempt to _ derive _ the set of quantum correlations from amongst all correlations obeying the no - signaling principle . in parallel , cryptographic protocols",

    "the eavesdropper eve is assumed to be limited to the preparation of boxes ( input - output statistics ) obeying a set of constraints collectively referred to as the no - signaling constraints .",
    "the general properties of no - signaling theories have been investigated @xcite in a related program to formulate an information - theoretic axiomatic framework for quantum theory . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum theory does not provide a mechanism for the non - local correlations .",
    "several theoretical proposals have been put forward to explain the phenomenon of non - local correlations between quantum particles via superluminal communication between them .",
    "these models go beyond quantum mechanics but reproduce the experimental statistical predictions of quantum mechanics , the most famous of these models being the de broglie - bohm pilot wave theory @xcite .    in all relativistic theories ,  causality , \" is imposed i.e. , the requirement that causes must precede effects in all space - time rest frames . before going further , two remarks are in order here .",
    "first , by an effect we mean any possible event , even if it has been affected by other events ( causes ) indirectly .",
    "second , we shall use as general a correlation point of view as possible , _ regardless _ of the physical theory from which the correlations arise . in this context , let us also note that given an arbitrary space - time structure , the question of causal order for any two measures has been formalized using intuitions from optimal transport theory @xcite . furthermore it has been proven that in any hyperbolic space - time , casuality of the evolution of measures supported on time - slices is an observer independent concept @xcite .",
    "both formalisms have also been applied in the study of the evolution of the quantum wavepackets showing in particular the natural consistency of the causality concept with the relativistic continuity equation @xcite . from the perspective of communication",
    ", the requirement of relativistic causality strictly demands that no faster - than - light ( ftl ) transmission of information takes place between a sender and a receiver . the no - signaling principle being in ubiquitous use ( in device - independent cryptography , axiomatic formulations , etc . as explained earlier ) , a natural question is to explore whether the no - signaling constraints that are currently in use precisely capture the constraints imposed by relativistic causality , i.e. , to derive the no - signaling constraints from relativistic causality . in this paper",
    ", we investigate this question and find that , surprisingly , the answer is that the multi - party no - signaling principle requires a modification to capture the notion of causality . in particular ,",
    "the actual no - signaling constraints that one must impose in a multi - party bell experiment are dictated by the space - time configuration of the measurement events in the experiment .",
    "this modification of the no - signaling constraints naturally leads to a number of implications in tasks of device - independent cryptography against relativistic eavesdroppers and to explanations of quantum correlations via finite - speed superluminal influences .",

    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we initially establish the setup of the bell experiment and recall the assumptions in the bell theorem .",
    "we then define the notion of relativistic causality that we use in this paper ( and that is commonly accepted , i.e. , that there be no causal loops in spacetime ) and revisit the derivation of the two - party no - signaling constraints from causality .",
    "we then show that , in the multi - party scenario , only a restricted subset of the no - signaling constraints is required to ensure that no causal loops appear .",
    "we explicitly identify a region of space - time for the measurement events in a bell scenario where the usual no - signaling constraints fail . in this regard ,",
    "we extend a particular framework of  jamming \" non - local correlations by grunhaus , popescu and rohrlich in @xcite based upon an earlier suggestion of shimony in @xcite .",
    "we then examine the implications of the restricted subset of no - signaling constraints for device - independent cryptographic tasks against an eavesdropper constrained only by the laws of relativity .",
    "we detail explicit attacks on known protocols for randomness amplification based on the ghz - mermin inequalities using boxes that obey the new relativistic causality conditions .",
    "we show that from that perspective the security theory needs revision , and - in a way - to the some degree collapses .",
    "we also explore the implications on some of the known features of no - signaling theories @xcite , in particular we find that the phenomenon of monogamy of correlations is significantly weakened in the relativistically causal theories and that the monogamy of chsh inequality violation @xcite disappears in certain spacetime configurations .",
    "the notions of freedom - of - choice and no - signaling are known to be intimately related @xcite .",
    "we re - examine how the notion of free - choice as proposed by bell and formalized by colbeck and renner @xcite can be stated mathematically within the structure of a space - time configuration of measurement events .",
    "a breakthrough result in @xcite was a claim that any finite superluminal speed explanation of quantum correlations could lead to superluminal signaling and must hence be discarded .",
    "we re - examine this question in light of the modified relativistic causality and free - will conditions . both non - relativistic quantum theory and relativistic quantum field theory @xcite",

    "let us first establish the setup of a typical bell experiment . in the bell scenario denoted @xmath1 , we have @xmath0 space - like separated parties , each of whom chooses from among @xmath2 possible measurement settings and obtains one of @xmath3 possible outcomes . in general , the number of inputs and outputs for each party may vary , but this will not concern us in this paper .",

    "parameter - independence _ :",
    "for each so - called  microstate \" @xmath38 , the probability of an outcome on alice s side is assumed to be ( stochastically ) independent of the experimental setting ( the parameters of the device ) on bob s side , @xmath39 the justification for this assumption comes from special relativity , which imposes that spacelike separated measurements do not influence each other s underlying outcome probability distributions .",
    "measurement independence _ : the measurement inputs are uncorrelated with the underlying variable @xmath33 @xmath40 this is also sometimes called the _ free - choice _ assumption , i.e. , that the inputs @xmath37 are chosen freely , independent of @xmath33 . we elaborate on the notion of freeness in this two - party bell experiment in section [ subsec : two - party - freewill ] @xcite .",
    "there are other assumptions such as : fair sampling , no backward causation , reality being single valued , etc . @xcite but these will not concern us in this paper .",
    "substituting eqs.([eq : two - party - oi ] , [ eq : two - party - pi ] , [ eq : two - party - mi ] ) in eq.([eq : two - party - bi ] ) , we obtain the description of a local hidden variable model : @xmath41 figure [ fig : two - party - caus - struc ] shows the causal structure represented by the two - party bell experiment represented in terms of a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) @xcite .",
    "remark that the local hidden variable model in eq.([eq : lhv - model ] ) can also be arrived at starting from other postulates such as local causality @xcite .      from the assumptions of parameter - independence and measurement - independence",
    ", one can deduce the _ no - signaling constraints _ : @xmath42 the no - signaling conditions in this two - party bell experiment formally state that probability distribution of the outcomes of any party is independent of the input of the other party .",
    "the assumption of measurement - independence or free - choice can be formally expressed in terms of spacetime random variables . in the two - party bell experiment ,",
    "one imposes the free - choice constraints @xmath43 one formal way to define the freedom - of - choice condition in terms of spacetime random variables was formulated by colbeck and renner ( cr ) in @xcite .",
    "recall that we denote a causal order relation by @xmath18 if @xmath19 in all inertial reference frames , i.e. , @xmath17 is in the future light cone of @xmath16 so that @xmath16 cause @xmath17 .",
    "cr formulate the notion of free - choice ( formalising bell s notion from @xcite ) as follows :    [ def : freewill ] a spacetime random variable @xmath16 is said to be free if @xmath16 is uncorrelated with every spacetime random variable @xmath17 such that @xmath44 , i.e. , for all such @xmath17 , we have @xmath45 .    in other words , @xmath16 is free if it is uncorrelated with any @xmath17 that it could not have caused , where the requirement for @xmath16 causing @xmath17 is that @xmath17 lies in the future light cone of @xmath16 .",
    "clearly , eq.([eq : two - party - freewill ] ) follows if one adopts this notion of freedom - of - choice , although note that the def .",
    "[ def : freewill ] is strictly stronger than just the conditions ( [ eq : two - party - freewill ] ) imposed in the bell theorem .      in this paper , our focus is on the no - signaling and free - will constraints above which are intimately related to each other .",
    "in particular , we consider the generalization of the no - signaling conditions to the multi - party scenario .",
    "the generalized multi - party no - signaling constraints are usually stated as follows ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath46 , \\{a_1 , \\dots , a_n\\ } \\setminus a_j , \\{x_1 , \\dots , x_j , x'_j , \\dots , x_n\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in words , the above constraints state that the outcome distribution of any subset of parties is independent of the inputs of the complementary set of parties ( while eq.([eq : multi - party - ns ] ) imposes this for subsets of @xmath47 parties , one can straightforwardly show that this also implies that the marginal distribution for smaller sized subsets is well - defined @xcite ) .",
    "now , given that as stated earlier the justification of the two - party no - signaling constraint came from the causality constraints of special relativity , the natural question which we investigate in this paper is to what extent the multi - party no - signaling constraints in eq.([eq : multi - party - ns ] ) are imposed by the causality constraints of special relativity .",
    "in other words , while the constraints in eq.([eq : multi - party - ns ] ) are clearly sufficient to ensure that no superluminal signaling takes place , we derive the set of necessary and sufficient constraints that ensure that no causal loops appear in the theory .",
    "we will see that the multi - party no - signaling conditions in fact depend on the space - time coordinates of the measurement events in the bell experiment and we propose an appropriate modification of these constraints .",
    "the main results of the paper are as follows .    1 .",
    "we derive in prop . [",

    "we show that in general , depending on the exact space - time coordinates of the measurement events of the parties participating in a bell experiment , relativistic causality strictly only imposes a subset of the usual no - signaling conditions .",

    "we consider the causal structure of measurement events occurring at fixed spacetime locations @xmath51 . within this regime ,",
    "the relativistic causality constraint we consider is simply that :    * no _ causal loops _ occur , where a causal loop is a sequence of events , in which one event is among the causes of another event , which in turn is among the causes of the first event .",
    "causality implies that for two causally related events taking place at two spatially separated points , the cause always occurs before the effect , and this sequence can not be changed by any choice of a frame of reference .",

    "suppose by contradiction that one of the constraints in eq.([eq : two - party - ns ] ) was violated , for definiteness , let us suppose that the marginal distribution of bob s outputs depended upon the input of alice , i.e. , suppose @xmath68 note that by assumption , alice chooses her measurement freely , i.e. , @xmath69 so suppose that in some specific run alice chooses the input @xmath70 at spacetime location @xmath54 .",
    "since alice and bob s measurement events are spacelike separated , eq.([eq : alice - signal - bob ] ) would imply physically that a superluminal influence propagated from alice s system to bob s system informing bob of alice s input @xmath71 .",

    "one might wonder if the resulting theory can still be lorentz invariant .",
    "firstly , as we have argued , the superluminal influence does not lead to _ superluminal transmissions of information _ , which are what relativity theory actually prohibits , since they can lead to causal loops and grandfather paradoxes .",

    "this confers a larger set of attack strategies for an eavesdropper who may prepare boxes for the honest parties from this larger set .",
    "as shown in proposition [ prop : ra - rel - caus ] , in certain known device - independent protocols for the cryptographic task of randomness amplification @xcite , this larger set of attack strategies can severely compromise the security of the protocol , the honest parties were to perform the required bell test in a spacetime measurement configuration where the superluminal influence can take effect .",
    "secondly , and crucially , the security of cryptographic protocols ( even relying on a two - party bell test ) can be compromised when the measurement event of eve s system happens in a suitable spacetime location . in particular , as shown in proposition [ prop : qkd - sec - rel - caus ] , the property of monogamy of non - local correlations can break down under the relativistic causality constraints so that such an eavesdropper can obtain full information about the output of the honest parties in the protocol .",
    "remark that the first type of attack strategy above may be circumvented if the honest parties perform their measurements in a carefully chosen measurement configuration where the usual no - signaling constraints ( [ eq : multi - party - ns ] ) are both necessary and sufficient .",
    "in contrast , the second type of attack can only be avoided if certain assumptions are made about the space - time location of the eavesdropper s measurement event , or alternatively if the honest parties systems are assumed to be sufficiently shielded from all influences , even those respecting causality .",
    "the implications manifest as an adversarial attack strategy in device - independent protocols for randomness generation , amplification and key distribution when the adversary is only subject to the laws of relativity such as considered in @xcite as opposed to the scenario when the adversary is in addition assumed to obey the laws of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the key step in such a device - independent protocol is a test for the violation of a bell inequality .",
    "multiple observers , who are spatially separated , choose random inputs on their parts of a device and check that the outcomes conform to the violation of some specific bell inequality .",
    "the notion of device - independence then stems from the black - box scenario , the parties do not have access to the inner workings of the device and the security of the protocol is assessed solely based on the input - output statistics of the device , so that the device may have been prepared by the adversary eve herself .",
    "mathematically , the device in any single run of the protocol is described by the set of conditional probability distributions ( box ) @xmath280 . here",
    "@xmath281 and @xmath282 denote the outputs and inputs of the device for the @xmath0 honest parties in the protocol .",
    "the parties check the input - output statistics to assess the value of a bell expression and make an inference about @xmath283 , where @xmath14 is an indicator vector for the bell expression that picks out the suitable input - output pairs .",
    "the proof of security of such protocols relies on the inference drawn from the observed bell violation regarding the amount of randomness present in the output .",
    "this is achieved by checking that for all non - signaling boxes @xmath284 that achieve this bell value , for some function @xmath285 of the outputs for some set of inputs @xmath286 , it happens that @xmath287 , where @xmath288 @xcite . as an example , in the protocol of barrett , hardy and kent @xcite for quantum key distribution , the observation of correlations between alice and bob s outputs as in the braunstein - caves - pearle chained bell inequality @xcite leads to the conclusion that in the limit of a large number of runs , each party s output was necessarily uniformly random .",
    "this is because all no - signaling boxes that maximally violate the chained bell inequality possess the property of uniformly random marginals for each party .",
    "similar considerations also hold for the protocols considered in @xcite where the maximal violation of a multi - party inequality belonging to the ghz - mermin family @xcite , leads to the conclusion that a particular function of the outputs ( the majority of a subset of the parties output bits in this case ) gives rise to randomness .    now , from the considerations of the previous sections , we see that there is a larger set of boxes that respect relativistic causality than those belonging to the usually considered no - signaling polytope , depending on the spatial locations of the parties .",
    "this implies that an adversary who is aware of the spatial locations of the parties involved in the protocol may provide them with a box that satisfies only the relativistic causality conditions stated in this paper .",
    "in particular , when the @xmath0 parties are in a line , the relativistic causality constraints ( the subset of the usual no - signaling constraints needed to ensure that causality is not violated ) are given from section [ subsec : multi - party - rel - caus ] as    @xmath289    for all @xmath216 with @xmath217 and for all @xmath218 with @xmath219 .",

    "in other words , the marginal distribution of the outputs for a contiguous subset of parties inputs is independent of the complementary set of parties inputs . on the other hand , for a non - contiguous subsets of parties , the joint probability distribution of their outputs can depend on the inputs of the complementary set , i.e. , the parties in between can change the marginal distributions by their choice of inputs while still respecting relativistic causality .",
    "the boxes @xmath290 are thus only required to obey the restricted set of constraints imposed in eq.([eq : rel - caus-2 ] ) as opposed to the usual no - signaling constraints ( which posit that the marginal distribution of _ every _ subset of parties outputs is independent of the input of the complementary set of parties ) .",

    "@xcite , who produced a laser pulse in atomic cesium gas with a group velocity index of @xmath465 .",
    "the observed superluminal propagation of the wave is not at odds with causality , and is instead a consequence of classical interference between its constituent frequency components in a region of anomalous dispersion @xcite .",
    "secondly , as mentioned before , the justification that special relativity does not necessarily exclude faster - than - light propagation has also been known for a while @xcite .",
    "a main objection to the existence of these particles was that they would lead to violations of causality and as such must be unphysical @xcite , which as we have seen can be overcome by the considerations of this paper .",
    "thirdly , recall that the notion of point - to - region signaling considered in this paper is formulated as the nonlocal influence of a field rather than of a superluminal particle .",
    "evidence in favor of a superluminal field emerges from the fact that spin - zero ftl particles ( satisfying the klein - gordon equation ) _ can not _ be localized as pointlike particles , contrary to all other known fundamental constituents of matter @xcite .",
    "a brief overview of the argument is as follows , for details see @xcite .",
    "consider the wavefunction @xmath466 of a free tachyon of spin zero obeying the klein - gordon equation in @xmath183 dimensions @xmath467 with solutions that are superpositions of @xmath468 with the energy - momentum relation @xmath469 .",
    "for the particle moving with velocity @xmath226 , we have that @xmath470 is imaginary and @xmath471 is negative , so that we can consider the solutions with @xmath472 as well as those with @xmath473 .",

    "finally , note that in algebraic quantum field theory , as mentioned earlier , to every bounded open subset @xmath480 of spacetime , one can associate observables @xmath481 and observables in spacelike separated regions @xmath482 are required to commute , i.e. , for all @xmath483 and @xmath484 we have @xmath485 = 0 $ ] thus ensuring that the causal constraints are satisfied . in linear field theories , there is a complete duality between particles and fields , via the well - known fock space construction .",
    "however as haag pointed out @xcite , the one - to - one correspondence between particles and fields holds only in the asymptotic sense , i.e , as time goes to @xmath486 ( in the heisenberg picture ) , the limit fields obey the free field equation and canonical commutation relations so as to describe free particles ; so that it may well be that a quantum field theory does not describe any localized particles at all @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the no - signaling constraints from the point of view of causality and proposed a modification to these constraints to a subset that ensures preservation of causality depending on the spacetime configuration of measurement events . as a consequence",
    ", we find that boxes in the post - quantum scenario , where one only restricts to the constraints imposed by relativistic causality , should be labeled by the space - time locations of the parties performing the measurement .",
    "the correlations that the parties observe can then exhibit various dependencies while still being consistent with relativistic causality .",
    "several questions are open .",
