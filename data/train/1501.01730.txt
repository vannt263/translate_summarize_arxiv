    "as the paradigm of the early universe , inflation has been generally regarded as a possible solution of the horizon , flatness , entropy , homogeneity , isotropy and primordial monopole problems@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "but maybe far more attractive is that inflation can generate the primordial perturbations , which have grown into all the structures observed in our universe today .",
    "the observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by planck and wmap has provided us with more and more information of the early universe , which shows that the single field slow - roll inflationary model is more likely to be the right one .    however , a large - scale ( or low-@xmath0 ) power deficit in cmb tt - mode spectrum observed by wmap @xcite and recently confirmed by the planck collaboration@xcite@xcite with higher precision is not concordant with the standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "it is hard to attribute this power deficit to the foreground as it has been observed by experiments with higher and higher statistical significance .",
    "though the cosmic variance could be a source of this deficit , it is still very likely that the large - scale anomalies are induced by the physics preceding inflation , as the larger are the scales of the perturbations , the earlier are the times corresponding to their horizons exiting .",
    "the slow - roll inflation might last for just the minimal number of @xmath1-folds , i.e. , just enough @xcite , and thus the power deficit on a large scale may be attributed to the pre - inflationary non - slow - roll evolution . in this case , the planck best - fit single - field inflationary model only actually provides a fit for the intermediate and small angular scales .",
    "after the wmap1 data were released , some studies have been done in refs.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite along this line , and also recently @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; see ref.@xcite for a review .",
    "however , it might be more interesting that the large - scale anomalies could be relevant with the physics solving the initial singularity problem of inflation @xcite,@xcite . in the bouncing model ( see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite for reviews ) , initially the universe is in a contracting phase , and then it bounces into an expanding phase , which results in a solution to the cosmological singularity problem . in refs.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , it was noticed that if the universe is initially in a contracting phase and after the bounce it begins to inflate , the power spectrum of primordial perturbations will get a large - scale cutoff , which may naturally explain the power deficit of the cmb tt - mode spectrum at low-@xmath0 ; see , e.g. , @xcite for details . in addition , it was also observed in @xcite that if the pre - inflationary bounce actually occurs , the bb - mode correlation at low-@xmath0 is also suppressed , while the tb- and eb - mode correlations on a corresponding scale may be enhanced .",
    "the superinflationary phase before slow - roll inflation may also provide a singular - free realization of inflation , which in the meantime explains the anomalies of the cmb power spectrum @xcite,@xcite ; see also @xcite,@xcite for an almost flat pre - inflationary universe .    in the above pre - inflationary scenarios , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ,",
    "initially the primordial perturbation is deep inside the horizon , which naturally set itself in bunch - davies(bd ) vacuum .",
    "this implies that we can calculate a large - scale power spectrum without any assumption for the initial state of primordial perturbations .",
    "however , it is possible that the pre - inflationary era might consist of multiple phases with different background evolution , e.g. , @xcite . in a certain sense",
    ", the introduction of multiple pre - inflationary phases may better simulate the physics of the pre - inflationary era , since due to the complexity of pre - inflationary physics , sometimes a single phase can hardly reflect the drastic change of the background parameters , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to have a quantitative estimate for the power spectra of primordial perturbations from an arbitrary pre - inflationary era , involving the multiple phases with different background dynamics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[au]a",
    ", we introduce the evolution of the pre - inflationary background , which we will focus on , consisting of multiple phases .",
    "we require that the primordial perturbations can be produced in these phases . in sec.[au]b",
    ", we perform a model - independent calculation for the primordial perturbations and give a universal formula for the power spectra of primordial perturbations in terms of the recursive bogoliubov coefficients . in sec.[double ] , we apply our formula to the bounce inflation and the superinflation preceding slow - roll inflation and show how the intensity of the large - scale power suppression of a primordial spectrum is affected by the pre - inflationary physics .",
    "we will see that a large - scale suppressed primordial spectrum may result in the power deficit at low-@xmath0 in the cmb tt - mode spectrum ; however , the intensity of the power suppression is model - dependent .",
    "sec.[conclusion ] is the discussion .    in appendix",
    "a , we will investigate the wronskian constraint for primordial perturbations and argue that in a certain sense the scenario with pre - inflationary era is equivalent to the inflation scenario with the non - bunch - davis initial state . in appendix b",
    ", we will approximately estimate the spectra index of primordial perturbations produced in each phase .",
    "the pre - inflationary era may consist of multiple phases .",
    "we define the inflation as phase 0 , the latest pre - inflationary phase as phase @xmath2 , and so on .",
    "the cosmological evolution of phase @xmath3 is a_i~^,or(-)^,[aa]where @xmath4 is a constant , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the conformal time .",
    "the phase @xmath3 may be expanding or contracting .",
    "however , noting the continuities of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the evolutions of the inflation and phase @xmath3 can be rewritten as a_0()= , a_i()=a_i(_i-1)^ [ a],respectively , where @xmath9 is that at the onset of inflation , @xmath10 is the conformal hubble parameter during slow - roll inflation , and @xmath11 is the matching time between phase @xmath3 and phase @xmath12 , which signals the onset of phase @xmath12 .",
    "it seems that @xmath13 is arbitrary .",
    "however , if we require that initially all perturbation modes are in the bd state , which is right only if its wavelength @xmath14 , @xmath13 will be constrained . that the perturbation mode with @xmath15 extends outside the horizon in phase @xmath3 marks the primordial perturbation that is produced in this phase , which requires @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath17 must increase with time , which implies _ i & < & -1/3   for the expanding phase , + or _",
    "i & > & -1/3   for the contracting phase .",
    "[ w]or equally in other words , ( [ w ] ) must be satisfied to guarantee the primordial perturbations that can be produced during phase @xmath3 .",
    "the slow - roll inflation is the evolution with @xmath18 , which satisfies ( [ w ] ) .",
    "in general , there may be multiple pre - inflationary phases .",
    "any one of them might be a contracting phase or an expanding phase . therefore , there are two kinds of typical scenarios which have aroused lots of interests , i.e. , the bouncing scenario and the superinflation scenario , which we will focus on in secs . iii.a and iii.b .",
    "in the bouncing scenario , a bounce happened near the end of the contracting phase then was followed by an expanding phase with @xmath19 .",
    "the bounce may be implemented by applying a higher - order derivative field @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , which is ghost - free , and also viscous fluid @xcite and modified gravity @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the expansion with @xmath20 is called superinflation , which is similar to the emergent scenario and describes a monotonically expanding universe with increasing energy density .",
    "the primordial perturbations generated during the superinflation have been studied earlier in refs.@xcite,@xcite . the case with @xmath21 corresponds to the slow expansion scenario , which has been proposed in ref.@xcite ( see also @xcite,@xcite for the genesis scenario ) and investigated in detail in refs.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is shown in ref.@xcite that there is no ghost instability during superinflation .",
    "thus the pre - inflationary universe may also be superinflating .",
    "it is interesting to notice that both bounce and superinflation preceding slow - roll inflation may provide a singular - free realization of inflation .",
    "however , if the pre - inflationary era is the expanding phase with @xmath22 characterized by fast - rolling dominance , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , except for the initial fast - roll inflation , e.g. , @xcite , or the expanding phase with radiation dominance @xcite,@xcite , initially the perturbation mode should be outside the horizon , so it is not clear how to set its initial condition .",
    "it is possible that its initial value is set in a phase preceding fast - rolling dominance ; however , this phase is still required to satisfy ( [ w ] ) , e.g. , a higher energy inflation preceding the fast - rolling phase @xcite ; see @xcite for comments , and see also @xcite for a domain wall or cosmic string phase . here , we will not involve this issue and will assume that all pre - inflationary phases satisfy ( [ w ] ) , which assures initially all perturbation modes are naturally set in bd vacuum and each phase may contribute to the production of primordial perturbations with the certain range of wave numbers .",
    "we qualitatively plot the evolutions of background and perturbation modes , which we will focus on , in fig.[fig : evo ] .    , and @xmath23 signals the onset of phase @xmath3 .",
    "the blue dashed lines denote the evolutions of the primordial perturbations.,width=377 ]      the equation of the primordial perturbation @xmath24 is @xcite,@xcite u^+(c_s^2k^2-)u=0 [ u],where @xmath25 , the prime is the derivative with respect to conformal time , @xmath26 @xcite , and @xmath27 @xcite for the superinflationary phase , and the definition of @xmath28 is @xmath29 .",

    "but in reality , the equation of state parameter may be nonconstant , the transitions should be smooth , and the equation of state parameter should change smoothly . however , as long as there are long phases with approximately constant equation of state parameters and relatively quick transitions between the different phases , the approximation we adopted to simplify our analysis and algorithm is reasonable .",
    "of course , the influence on the perturbations induced by a nonconstant equation of state parameter is interesting , and the effects of the modes that exit the hubble radius near the transition from one phase to another are even more intriguing , which have been studied in @xcite,@xcite .    throughout",
    ", we have used perturbation and background equations that are valid for general relativity ( gr ) , since we lack the knowledge of the new physics that is needed for the pre - inflationary evolution . to implement bounce and superinflation evolutions in gr",
    ", we must violate the null energy condition(nec ) or require a closed universe .",
    "otherwise , one must go beyond gr .",
    "the violation of nec in gr usually leads to ghosts , which indicate dangerous instability .",
    "one of the several ways to avoid ghosts is by introducing the higher - order derivative scalar field . in some ghost - free galileon bounce or superinflation models , by delicately designing the lagrangian , one can get the perturbation equation similar to ours in the form ( see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , in which the sound speed is constant , which is set as 1 here . in that case ,",
    "our analysis is still able to approximately capture the bounce or superinflation dynamics .",
    "additionally , in singular bounce models , e.g. , the original ekpyrotic model , the background is gr and the perturbation equation does not need to be modified , until the scale factor @xmath108 is so small that quantum gravity effects become important . then , if the bounce period is short so that the link between the contracting phase and the expanding phase is approximately instantaneous just as we have assumed , our analysis is also approximately valid .",
    "however , in some kinds of modified gravity theories , in which the perturbation equations are modified , especially when higher - order terms of gravity appear in the perturbation equations , e.g. , @xcite , our analysis will no longer be robust and will need to be revisited .",
    "it is significant that recently in @xcite , some general results for the evolutions of perturbation modes during bounce have become available , which might be used to track the perturbations during the bounce . and",
    "obtaining the recursive matrix for some specific bouncing model to better understand how the modes evolve during this period is an interesting issue , which we will back to in the future .",
    "we have assumed @xmath30 after eq.([u ] ) , which is suitable for the cosmology driven by the scalar field .",
    "however , for an ideal fluid , @xmath109 , and for @xmath110 , it is negative which indicates an instability in the system .",
    "it is well known in thermal physics that a negative heat capacity typically implies that one is looking at thermal fluctuations around an incorrect ( possibly tachyonic ) vacuum . for @xmath110 ,",
    "essentially the short wavelength fluctuations grow exponentially rather than oscillate .",
    "actually , for scalar fields , @xmath111 may also be different from @xmath2 .",
    "the effects of varying sound speed on primordial perturbations has been studied ; see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "but as long as @xmath111 is a positive constant during each phase , our result is not qualitatively altered .",
    "when deriving ( [ prc1c2 ] ) , we assume that around and at matching surfaces the perturbation mode has no ghost and gradient instabilities . how to implement such a requirement is an interesting issue , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , if this requirement is not satisfied , which actually is not allowed physically , the result of the perturbation spectrum will be strongly affected by the physical details around the matching surface .    *",
