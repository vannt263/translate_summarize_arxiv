    "under various solvent conditions , a polymer chain can be either swollen or collapsed . in a bad",
    "solvent , a phase transition between these two states can occur as temperature is varied @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath0 point , the tricritical nature of which has been demonstrated by de gennes @xcite .",
    "the effective monomer - monomer attraction results from tracing out the solvent degrees of freedom . at the @xmath0 point , the second virial coefficient of the polymer vanishes .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a different mechanism that also yields attractive monomer - monomer interactions .",
    "the model we study consists of a polymer chain , where each monomer carries a spin @xmath1 in an external magnetic field ; these spins interact with each other with a short - ranged interaction . to be specific",
    ", we will consider a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) of length @xmath2 , on a @xmath3 dimensional cubic lattice , with a nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction ( on the lattice ) between the spins of the monomers .",
    "several models involving both polymeric and magnetic - like degrees of freedom have been introduced in very different contexts .",
    "a similar , but somewhat more complicated model , was studied to describe secondary structure formation in proteins @xcite : there , the dominant interactions between the monomers are of ( electric ) dipolar nature . a potts model on a saw was studied as a description of vulcanization in @xcite ; a similar model with quenched disorder was studied in the context of secondary structure formation in proteins @xcite .",
    "ising models have also been studied on a fixed saw geometry , yielding results quite different from those presented here @xcite . from an experimental point of view",
    ", organic polymeric magnets have recently become of interest @xcite .",
    "however , there has been very little interest in their conformational changes .    in the following",
    ", we will specialize to the ising case , and quote some results for the heisenberg case .",
    "the partition function of the system reads : [ z ] z= _ saw _",
    "s_i=1 ( j 2 _ i j s_i",
    "_ r_i r_j s_j + h _",
    "i s_i ) where @xmath4 is the exchange energy , @xmath5 the inverse temperature , and @xmath6 the external magnetic field .",
    "the spatial position of monomer @xmath7 with spin @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "the symbol @xmath10 is 1 if @xmath11 are nearest - neighbor on the lattice and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "the sums run over all possible saw and all spin configurations .",
    "this model will be studied along three lines . in section [ bounds ] , we derive upper bounds for the free energy of the model ( in zero magnetic field ) which suggest a first order transition between a swollen paramagnetic and a collapsed magnetized phase . in section [ mean_field ] , we derive a mean - field theory for the general model .",
    "we show that indeed for low fields , there is a such a line of first - order transitions . at higher fields",
    ", this transition becomes continuous .",
    "the two regimes are separated by a multicritical @xmath13 point . at this special point , both the second and the third virial coefficient vanish . in section [ mc ] , these predictions are tested against monte carlo simulations in @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "the numerical results are consistent with the theoretical phase diagram ; at low field ( where the transition is strongly first order ) , the agreement is even quantitative .",
    "the physics of the model can be described according to the following simple picture :    1 .   at high temperature ,",
    "since entropy dominates , the chain is swollen . as a result ,",
    "the number of nearest - neighbor contacts is small , and from a magnetic point of view , the system is equivalent to a one dimensional ising model .",
    "this simple picture can be expressed through the following inequality : [ bound1 ] z z_saw   z_1 ( h ) where @xmath15 is the total number of saw , and @xmath16is the partition function of the one dimensional ising model in a field @xmath6 .",
    "using well known results @xcite : z_saw ~^n n^- 1 where @xmath17 is a critical exponent , we obtain : [ free1 ] fn -t -t ( e^j + ) the best estimate in @xmath14 is @xmath18 for the cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "2 .   at low temperature ,",
    "the magnetic energy is larger than the entropy loss due to confinement , and thus the chain collapses .",
    "the simplest picture is that of a totally magnetized and fully compact system , resulting in the following bound : [ bound2 ] z ( n j d + n h )  z_hp where @xmath19 is the entropy of hamiltonian paths ( hp ) on the lattice , i.e. fully compact saw on the lattice . using a virtually exact upper bound @xcite to @xmath20 , we obtain : [ free2 ] fn -t - j d - h note that in two dimensions and in zero magnetic field , it is possible to write a more accurate bound by using the exact expression @xmath21 for the onsager partition function of the ising model : z z_2",
    "z_hp    the free energy bounds of equations ( [ free1 ] ) and ( [ free2 ] ) are shown as functions of temperature in figure 1 , for @xmath14 and @xmath22 .",
    "the true free energy lies below these two curves , and their intersection is an indication for a possible first order transition between the swollen and collapsed phases .",
    "by using a gaussian transform , it is possible to write a field - theoretical representation for the model ( [ z ] ) : [ field1 ] z= 2 ^ n _ r d _ r ( -1 2 j _ \\{r , r } _",
    "r ^-1 _ r , r _ r + ) as usually , the mean - field theory can be obtained by performing a saddle - point approximation on equation ( [ field1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the chain is confined in a volume @xmath23 with a monomer density @xmath24 . assuming a translationally invariant field @xmath25 , the mean field free energy per monomer is [ meanfield1 ] f = f n = -t 2 + t^2 2 j q ^2 -t z_saw -t ( + h ) where @xmath26 is the coordination number of the cubic lattice and @xmath15 is the total number of saw of @xmath2 monomers confined in a volume @xmath23 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , it is easily seen that : z_saw ( q e ) ^n so that [ meanfree ] f = -t 2 + t^2 2 j q ^2 -t + t  1-  ( 1- ) -t ( + h ) this free energy is to be minimized with respect to the field @xmath25 and to the volume @xmath23 occupied by the chain , or equivalently to the monomer concentration @xmath27 .",
    "the mean field equations read : t ^2 2 j q & = & -- ( 1- ) [ conc ] + & = & j q  ( + h ) [ mag ] note that this free energy holds also for a melt of chains , where @xmath27 is the total monomer concentration .",
    "this set of coupled equations has a high temperature solution @xmath28 , which describes the swollen phase with no magnetization and vanishing monomer concentration , and a low temperature solution , which describes a collapsed phase with a finite monomer concentration and magnetization .",
    "more precisely , for magnetic fields @xmath29 , there is a first order transition ( as a function of temperature ) between a swollen and a collapsed phase . at higher fields @xmath30 , the transition becomes second order ( in fact tricritical ) . for infinite fields , the magnetization saturates , and",
    "the model becomes equivalent to the ordinary @xmath0 point as studied in many papers @xcite .",
    "expanding ( [ conc ] ) and ( [ mag ] ) , one obtains the equation for the second order line : [ crit ] h = close to this critical line , the concentration varies as : ~12 1 - j q ^2 h ( j q ) ( 1- ^2 h ) - 13 and the magnetization per spin is given by m ~h and remains finite , whereas the magnetization per unit volume , given by m ~h vanishes .",
    "the phase diagram is shown in figure 2 , with values corresponding to dimension @xmath14 .",
    "the first order and continuous transitions are separated by a multicritical point , denoted by @xmath13 on figure 2 .",
    "the corresponding temperature and field are @xmath31 and @xmath32 . at zero magnetic field ( point @xmath33 ) ,",
    "the transition temperature is @xmath34 , the critical concentration is @xmath35 and the critical magnetization per unit volume is @xmath36 .",
    "note that the magnetic susceptibility @xmath37 remains finite along the second order critical line .",
    "the same phase diagram holds for the heisenberg ferromagnet , with a multicritical @xmath13 point at @xmath38 .",
    "the zero - field point @xmath33 is at @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    using ( [ mag ] ) to eliminate @xmath25 as a function of @xmath27 , it is possible to express the free energy ( [ meanfree ] ) only as a function of the monomer concentration @xmath27 .",
    "this yields the virial expansion of the free energy .",
    "the second virial coefficient vanishes along the second order line ( [ crit ] ) , implying that the transition is @xmath0-like ( i.e. tricritical ) . at the multicritical @xmath13 point , both the second and third virial coefficients vanish , while the fourth order coefficient is positive .",
    "the monte carlo method @xcite used to compute thermodynamic as well as geometric properties of the magnetic chain relies on the multiple markov chain sampling .",
    "a detailed description of this method can be found in @xcite .",
    "the implementation we consider for a magnetic chain on a three dimensional cubic lattice , can be summarized as follows .",
    "we start from a single markov chain at fixed temperature @xmath42 .",
    "the probability @xmath43 of a ( magnetic ) chain configuration @xmath44 , is given by the boltzmann distribution @xmath45 with @xmath46 where the thermodynamic variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 are assigned their @xmath44-dependent values .",
    "this markov chain is generated by a metropolis heath bath sampling based on a hybrid algorithm for chains with pivot @xcite a well as local moves @xcite .",
    "pivot moves are nonlocal moves that assure the ergodicity of the algorithm ; they operate well in the swollen phase but their efficiency deteriorate close to the compact phase . in this",
    "respect local moves become essential to speed up the converge of the markov chain .",
    "finally , in addition to the moves that deform the chain , an algorithm based on glauber dynamics is considered to update the spin configuration along the chain . for a single markov chain",
    "we typically consider @xmath49 pivot moves intercalated by @xmath50 local moves and @xmath2 spin updates .",
    "the multiple markov chain algorithm is then implemented on the hybrid algorithm described above .",
    "the idea is to run in parallel a number @xmath51 ( in this work @xmath52 ) of markov chains at different temperatures @xmath53 . in practice , this set of temperatures is such that the configurations at @xmath54 and at @xmath55 have considerable overlap ( implying that @xmath56 and @xmath55 are close enough ) .",
    "we let the markov chains interact by possibly exchanging configurations as follows .",
    "two neighboring markov chains ( i.e. with temperatures @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) are selected at random with uniform probability .",
    "a trial move is an attempt to swap the two current configurations of these markov chains .",
    "if we denore by @xmath57 is the boltzmann probability of getting configuration @xmath58 at temperature @xmath42 , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the current states in the @xmath61th and @xmath62th markov chain , then we accept the trial move ( i.e. swap @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) with probability    @xmath63    the whole process is itself a ( composite ) markov chain that is ergodic , since the underlying markov chains are themselves ergodic .",
    "it turns out that the swapping procedure dramatically decreases the correlation times within each markov chain with little cost in cpu time since , in any case , one is interested in obtaining data at many temperatures @xcite .    for each multiple markov chain run we compute estimates , at a discrete set of temperatues @xmath42 , of quantities such as ( i ) the average energy @xmath64 and specific heat @xmath65 of the chain .",
    "the per monomer quantities will be denoted respectively by @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( ii ) the average magnetization per monomer @xmath68 ( iii ) the susceptibility @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , as a geometric quantity , we consider the mean squared radius of gyration @xmath70 of the chain . from now on , we will set @xmath71 , which amounts to give the values of the field and temperature in units of @xmath4 .",
    "we have done preliminary simulations at high ( @xmath72 ) and low ( @xmath73 ) temperature .",
    "our results ( figure 3 ) show that the chain undergoes a swollen to collapsed phase transition , in broad agreement with the mean field picture ; moreover , the radius of gyration is found to vary very little with the magnetic field ( note that mean field theory yields @xmath74 at @xmath75 in zero field ) . since a full exploration of the @xmath76 plane is difficult , we have restricted this paper ( i ) to a detailed study of the @xmath22 transition ( ii ) to a qualitative study of some non zero magnetic field transitions . as mentionned above , the infinite field case corresponds to the usual @xmath0 situation : equation ( [ crit ] ) then yields @xmath77 , whereas the experimental ( cubic lattice ) value is @xmath78 @xcite . as expected in the presence of fluctuations ,",
    "the mean field parameters ( including the location of point @xmath13 ) are not reliable . for small @xmath6 , the first order caracter of the mean field transition will be seen to improve the situation .",
    "our results for the specific heat per monomer @xmath67 and the susceptibility @xmath79 are respectively given in figures 4 and 7 .",
    "the spiky character of both contrasts with the rounded specific heat of a usual @xmath0 point .",
    "indeed , finite size scaling theory @xcite predicts that the peak @xmath80 of the specific heat behaves , in the critical region ( i.e. for large enough @xmath2 ) , as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the critical exponent associated with the temperature divergence of the specific heat .",
    "accordingly , the critical temperature shifts from its @xmath83 value by an amount @xmath84 given by @xmath85 at the @xmath0 point , one has @xmath86 , implying a slow ( logarithmic ) @xmath2 dependence of @xmath80 and @xmath87 ( up to a logarithmic factor ) . on the contrary",
    ", a thermal first order transition corresponds to the value @xmath88 , yielding @xmath89 with a much weaker temperature shift @xmath90 .",
    "these scaling predictions are to be compared with the results of figures 5 and 12 .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory , even though it is not clear that the largest @xmath2 value , viz .",
    "@xmath91 , is already in the scaling region .",
    "further evidence for a discontinuous zero field transition comes from figures 6 and 8 , where we show the thermal evolution of the average magnetization per monomer @xmath92 and of the radius of gyration .",
    "all these results are consistent with a first order transition at a critical temperature @xmath93 , close indeed to the mean field value @xmath94 .    to study the phase coexistence implied by such a transition",
    ", we have studied the probability distributions of the magnetization @xmath92 and internal energy @xmath66 close to the phase transition .",
    "figures 9 and 10 , obtained for @xmath95 , suggest that the critical distributions @xmath96 and @xmath97 are flat , in marked contrast with the usual two peak structure at @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this two peak structure results from the spatial coexistence of the ( bulk ) phases along a domain wall ( more generally a @xmath98 interface ) . in the present case",
    ", we have coexistence between phases of different dimensionalities , namely a paramagnetic swollen phase and a magnetized collapsed phase .",
    "it is then clear that the `` interface '' can be reduced to a point , yielding a `` surface '' tension of order one .",
    "this in turn explains the flat critical distributions of figures 9 and 10 . below the transition",
    ", it is interesting to note that the magnetization quickly saturates : a closer look at compact chain magnetic conformations shows that the minority domains are located on the surface of the globule , and become less and less relevant as @xmath2 grows ( figure 11 ) .",
    "as previously mentionned , the multicritical point @xmath13 will be pushed downwards from its mean field location .",
    "since the computer search for a precise determination of this point is very time consuming , we have adopted the following strategy .",
    "we have performed simulations for small ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) and large ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) magnetic field .",
    "the first evidence for a second order transition in large fields comes from figure 12 , where the specific heat maximum for @xmath102 behaves very differently from its small field values : for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , one apparently gets the same behaviour as with @xmath22 , namely @xmath89 .",
    "the existence of a second order transition for @xmath6 large is corroborated by figures 14 and 15 .",
    "for @xmath101 , the critical probability distribution is very different from its @xmath22 counterpart ( figure 10 ) . a finite size scaling analysis of the data for the same value of the field yields , in a rather convincing manner , a second order @xmath0 like transition at @xmath103 ( remember that @xmath104 ) .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath105 . to get a better estimate of @xmath106 ,",
    "we have computed the probability distribution @xmath97 of the internal energy for @xmath99 ( figure 13 ) .",
    "it clearly interpolates between figures 10 and 14 , but it is not easy to interpret the data as representative of a continuous or discontinuous transition . to summarize , we have presented evidence for a continuous transition for large @xmath6 .",
    "the precise position of the point @xmath13 is left for future work .",
    "we have seen that ferromagnetic interactions may drive the collapse of a polymer , even in a good solvent .",
    "this collapse is very sensitive to the presence of an external magnetic field . it might be possible to design new polymeric magnetic materials , for which the collapse transition is triggered by a magnetic field , at room temperature .",
    "we have also done preliminary simulations on the two dimensional case ( ising polymer on a square lattice ) : for @xmath22 , we get a quite abrupt transition around @xmath107 ( which can be compared to the value @xmath108 @xcite ) . since the critical dimensions associated with the @xmath0 point ( @xmath109 theory ) and the multicritical @xmath13 point ( @xmath110 theory ) are respectively @xmath111 and @xmath112 , one expects fluctuations to be important .",
