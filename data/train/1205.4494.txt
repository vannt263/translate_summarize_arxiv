    "state - of - the - art low - noise heterodyne receivers are a key technology in radio astronomy and are needed to conduct high - resolution spectroscopy ( @xmath6 ) in the 0.3 - 5  terahertz ( thz ) frequency band . here , among many fundamental astronomical objects , for example , star - forming regions have very rich atomic and molecular spectra@xcite . the highest possible receiver sensitivity is needed because the signals which contain the astronomical information are usually very weak . for spectroscopy in the frequency band 0.3 - 1.2  thz ,",
    "heterodyne receivers employ superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) detectors as frequency mixing devices .",
    "they are operational up to frequencies of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the superconducting gap energy of the detector electrodes . for frequencies larger than @xmath7 where sis devices do not work anymore , superconducting hot - electron bolometers ( heb )",
    "are used  @xcite . in a thz heterodyne receiver a weak signal with frequency @xmath9 is detected by multiplying it with a strong local oscillator ( lo ) reference signal with frequency @xmath10 in the sis or heb device where the intermediate frequency ( if ) @xmath11 is produced . generally , @xmath12 ranges from 0 - 4  ghz for an heb device or from 4 - 12  ghz for an sis device .",
    "heterodyne detection preserves amplitude and phase of the incoming signal .",
    "therefore , heisenberg s uncertainty principle imposes a fundamental limit@xcite on the sensitivity usually expressed by a quantum noise temperature @xmath13 for double - sideband operation , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the planck and boltzmann constants .    for heterodyne receivers ,",
    "presently two established lo technologies are used .",
    "gunn oscillator driven multiplier chains@xcite for frequencies up to approximately 0.8  thz and synthesizer driven amplifier / multiplier chains that are easier to operate and which are used for almost the whole thz frequency range , nowadays even exceeding 2  thz@xcite .",
    "a gunn driven lo consists of a iii - v semiconductor ( usually gaas or inp ) embedded in a mechanically tunable high - q waveguide resonator which produces amplitude stable signals with high spectral purity and a very low amount of near - carrier noise power .",
    "a cascade of schottky diode frequency multipliers is used to produce the output frequency of the gunn driven lo .",
    "however , receivers in modern radio - astronomy experiments increasingly use synthesizer driven lo s due to their easy handling .",
    "first , the signal of the synthesizer is fed into a frequency multiplier , usually a doubler or a tripler .",
    "the output is connected to a power pre - amplifier which is connected to a cascade of frequency multipliers . with this",
    "technique frequencies up to approximately 2  thz can be produced .",
    "mainly stimulated by receiver developments for ground - based and space observatories where strict performance specifications have to be fulfilled , it was found that synthesizer based lo sources have to be operated and designed following rules which are summarized in@xcite .",
    "an important conclusion is that near - carrier lo noise power in these devices can be minimized if the input power saturates the lo components , i.e.  the power pre - amplifier and the multiplier chain .    in the near future quantum cascade lasers ( qcls@xcite )",
    "might offer another lo technology solving the problem of low output power for frequencies larger than 1  thz,@xcite rendering the development of heterodyne cameras possible .",
    "due to the laser operation a very low noise is expected for a qcl .",
    "the most sensitive heterodyne receivers operate at a few times the quantum noise limit . each element of the receiver , usually consisting of quasioptics to focus the signal and the lo beam on the mixer , followed by a low - noise cryogenic if amplifier,@xcite additional low - noise amplifiers at room temperature and a spectrometer adds a noise contribution to the total receiver noise temperature @xmath16 .",
    "this can be analyzed by decomposition according to the _ friis _ formula  @xcite . in practice , @xmath16 is measured with a standard @xmath17-factor method@xcite . lo",
    "near - carrier noise power which is among other things caused by a fluctuating lo amplitude ( am noise ) , is mixed down into the if band , thus has a substantial impact on @xmath16 and results in a decrease of the receiver s sensitivity",
    ". however , in a heterodyne receiver with a single - ended mixer an unambiguous separation and quantification of the unknown amount of near - carrier lo noise power from other receiver noise contributions is not possible .",
    "any noise from the lo sidebands is downconverted in the frequency mixing process and is at the end indistinguishable from the desired if signal@xcite .",
    "this shows that a single - ended mixer is very susceptible to this particular noise source .",
    "balanced mixers are much less sensitive to near - carrier lo noise power and offer the possibility of a direct quantification of the noise produced by the complete lo system . with this mixer technology",
    "it is possible to separate the lo am noise from other noise sources of the heterodyne receiver . in the submm range",
    "this was not possible for a long time due to the complexity of building sensitive balanced mixers for these small wavelengths .",

    "we measure the near - carrier noise power produced by three different lo sources : a gunn driven lo and a synthesizer driven lo with two different power pre - amplifiers .",
    "we show how to separate this unwanted noise contribution from the receiver system and quantify the equivalent near - carrier noise temperature @xmath2 by using our balanced mixer device as a noise meter .",
    "the impact of near - carrier noise power on single - ended mixers is studied in a second experiment and is used to verify our results .",
    "here we observe that the if spectra of the single - ended- and the balanced mixer measurements differ significantly .",
    "[ sec4 ] discusses the results and presents our conclusions .",
    "especially the conclusion with regard to the spectral characteristic of the lo noise is relevant for thz heb mixers that generally operate with a low if band and where the balanced technology is not yet broadly established . in these mixers near - carrier noise power from the lo can substantially degrade the receiver s sensitivity .",

    "the synthesizer is tuned either to a frequency between 10.7 - 12.2  ghz or to a frequency between 12.5 - 14.17  ghz and is connected to one of two actively biased frequency triplers .",
    "no frequency standard was used during our measurements .",

    "the frequency multiplier chain consists of three modules : two frequency doublers and a frequency tripler . for measurements using a gunn driven lo ,",

    "noise power from this load is superimposed with the lo signal .",
    "the thermal load in front of window 2 ( load 2 ) is either cooled to 77  k or replaced by a 295  k load and serves as a calibration blackbody radiation source , representing the sky signal .",
    "lo signal and noise power from load 1 are transmitted through window 1 ( lo port ) while noise power from load 2 is transmitted through window 2 ( signal port ) .",
    "both signals are received by the balanced mixer via two waveguide horn antennas a1 and a2 ( also referred to as `` mixer input ports '' in the text ) .",

    "the if signals @xmath26 and @xmath27 are produced and are separately amplified by two mmic wba13 low noise amplifiers lna1 and lna2@xcite .",
    "outside of the lhe dewar the two if signals are combined by a @xmath28 if hybrid coupler@xcite .",

    "our measurements can be applied to a thz lo . attaching the lower frequency active components of a thz lo to our lower frequency lo would provide a measurement method to characterize the thz lo noise performance , rendering precise characterizations of superconducting thz mixer devices possible . in a heterodyne measurement where we used only one of two mixers on the balanced mixer chip , our measurement shows the impact of lo noise power on single - ended mixers . here",
    "the expected result is that @xmath2 is added to @xmath16 .",
    "measuring the receiver noise temperature , the if trace of a balanced mixer shows a positive slope due to the bandwidth limited noise rejection .",
    "near - carrier lo noise power effects the single - ended if frequency resolved receiver noise temperature in a different way and the result is an increase of noise at lower frequencies , resulting in an effectively flat or even slightly negative slope .",
