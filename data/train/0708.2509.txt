    "oriented knots in @xmath0 are usually represented by knot diagrams .",
    "projecting a knot to a plane or 2-sphere in a generic direction gives an immersed oriented planar or spherical curve with finitely many double points , or crossings .",
    "a knot diagram is obtained by marking a neighborhood of each crossing to indicate which strand lies above the other .",
    "the higher strand is called the overcrossing and the lower one the undercrossing . starting with a knot diagram , one can recover the original knot up to isotopy by constructing a curve with the overcrossing arcs pushed slightly above the plane of the diagram .",
    "a central issue is to determine whether two knot diagrams represent the same knot , i.e. whether the curves in @xmath0 corresponding to each diagram are isotopic .",
    "if they represent the same knot we say that the two diagrams are _",
    "alexander and briggs  @xcite and independently reidemeister  @xcite showed that equivalent diagrams can be connected through isotopy and a series of three types of moves , usually referred to as reidemeister moves .",
    "the number of such moves required to connect two equivalent diagrams , is difficult to estimate .",
    "an exponential upper bound for the number of reidemeister moves required to connect two equivalent diagrams is obtained in  @xcite .",
    "we can get some lower bounds by looking at crossing numbers , writhes and winding numbers of diagrams since each reidemeister move changes these numbers by 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "less obvious bounds are obtained in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we define a new family of knot diagram invariants , and focus on one of them in particular .",
    "we found these invariants by following the program of arnold and vassiliev for finite order invariants .",
    "our invariants are of order one .    as an application , for each @xmath1 we present two diagrams @xmath2 for the unknot , each with @xmath3 crossings .",
    "for these two diagrams , which are almost identical , the writhe , cowrithe , crossing number and winding number give a lower bound of 2 for the number of reidemeister moves required to pass from one to the other .",
    "using our new invariant , we show that the minimal number of reidemeister moves required to pass from @xmath4 to @xmath5 is @xmath6 .",
    "we also obtain restrictions on which reidemeister moves may appear in any sequence of reidemeister moves which realizes this minimum .",
    "our invariant takes values in a very large abelian group .",
    "it is natural to investigate @xmath7 valued invariants obtained by composing it with homomorphisms into @xmath7 .",
    "the `` cowrithe '' introduced in @xcite is obtained in this way .",
    "we obtain a relation of the cowrithe to arnold s spherical curve invariants and the alexander - conway polynomial , which clarifies the limitations of the cowrithe for studying reidemeister moves .",
    "in what follows we consider two different types of geometric objects .",
    "the first objects , which are the subject of study in this paper , are knot diagrams in @xmath8 .",
    "two such diagrams are considered the same if they differ by an ambient isotopy of @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the set of all such diagrams by @xmath9 .",
    "our goal is to construct invariants of knot diagrams . towards that end",
    "we construct from a diagram a second geometric object , namely a two component link in @xmath0 .",
    "this is a smooth embedding of @xmath10 in @xmath0 .",
    "two such embeddings are considered the same if they differ by an ambient isotopy of @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the set of all two component links by @xmath11 , and the term _ links _ in this paper always refers to two component links .",
    "our basic construction relating knot diagrams to links is the following . given a knot diagram @xmath12 and a crossing @xmath13 in @xmath14 , define the smoothing @xmath15 , to be the link obtained by smoothing the crossing @xmath13 , i.e. performing a cut and paste on the four strands at the crossing that preserves the orientation of the arcs .",
    "the smoothing operation is independent of the orientation of the curve , since reversing orientation results in a change of orientation of both strands at the crossing .",
    "the diagram resulting from the smoothing is the diagram of an oriented 2-component link in @xmath0 , the link @xmath16 .",
    "we order the components so that the first @xmath17 in @xmath10 is the component that enters a neighborhood of the crossing along the overcrossing arc and leaves it along the undercrossing arc , see figure  [ smoothing ] .",
    "we define the sign of a crossing in a diagram in the usual way using the right - hand rule , so that each crossing in figure  [ smoothing ] is negative .",
    "we now show how each invariant of 2-component links gives rise to an invariant of knot diagrams . given a knot diagram @xmath14 , denote by @xmath18 the set of all positive crossings in @xmath14 and by @xmath19 the set of all negative crossings . given an invariant @xmath20 where @xmath21 is any set , let @xmath22 denote the free abelian group with basis @xmath23 .",
    "we then define the invariant @xmath24 as follows : @xmath25    a particularly interesting example occurs when @xmath26 is taken to be @xmath27 , the linking number of the two components of a link in @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting invariant is applied in the next section .",
    "we now compute how @xmath28 changes under reidemeister moves on @xmath14 .",
    "reidemeister moves ri , rii , riii , are illustrated in figure  [ reidmoves ] .",
    "ri : the contribution of all previously existing crossings is unchanged , and one new term is added .",
    "the added term is @xmath29 if the new crossing created by the reidemeister move is positive and is @xmath30 if the new crossing is negative , where @xmath31 is the value of @xmath26 on the link .",
    "see figure  [ linkab](a ) . in the case where @xmath32 , the added term is @xmath33 or @xmath34 , since the linking number of the smoothed link is @xmath35 .",
    "rii : again the contribution of all previously existing crossings is unchanged , but this time two new crossings are added .",
    "there are two cases , depending on whether the orientations of the two strands participating in the reidemeister move coincide or are opposite .",
    "we call these a _ matched _ or _ unmatched _ rii move , respectively .    for an unmatched rii move each of the two smoothings",
    "gives the same link ( see figure  [ linkab](b ) ) , so the addition to the value of @xmath36 due to the reidemeister move is of the form @xmath37 . for @xmath32",
    "this gives @xmath38 , where @xmath1 is the linking number of this two - component link .",
    "for a matched rii move , two different links appear from the two smoothings , differing from each other by one crossing change between the two components ( see figure  [ linkab](c ) ) .",
    "the addition to the value of @xmath36 is of the form @xmath39 where @xmath31 and @xmath40 are the values of @xmath26 on these two links .",
    "when @xmath32 , the negative smoothing produces a link with linking number greater by 1 than that produced by the positive smoothing , and so the added term is of the form @xmath41 .",
    "riii : to each crossing before the reidemeister move there corresponds a crossing after the move . for all crossings other than the three crossings participating in the move ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath36 is clearly unchanged .",
    "as to these three crossings , the crossing between the top and middle strand also gives the same contribution before and after the move , since one can slide the bottom strand below the smoothed crossing , to show that the same link type is produced .",
    "an instance of this is demonstrated in figure  [ link3 ] where diagrams @xmath42 are the diagrams before and after an riii move .",
    "the crossing between the top and middle strands is marked @xmath13 and @xmath43 are seen to be the same link , via an isotopy corresponding to the original riii move between @xmath14 and @xmath44 . by the same argument , the same is true for the crossing between the middle and bottom strands .        .",
    "the only contribution that changes is that of the crossing between the top and bottom strands .",
    "if the crossing of the top and bottom strands is positive , then a term @xmath29 is replaced by some term @xmath45 , and so the change in the value of the invariant is of the form @xmath46 . in the same way ,",
    "if the crossing of the top and bottom strands is negative , the change is of the form @xmath47 . for the case @xmath48 ,",
    "one checks directly that the linking numbers of these two links differ by precisely 1 .",
    "characteristic examples of the two basic cases appear in figure  [ lktopbot ] . for the links @xmath43 in figure  [ lktopbot ] , three strands appear .",
    "the two that participated in the smoothing belong to different components , while the third strand ( corresponding to the middle strand in @xmath42 ) belongs to one or the other component . from this",
    "it is clear that @xmath49 and @xmath50 differ by @xmath51 .",
    "a similar analysis applies to the links @xmath52 in figure  [ lktopbot ] .",
    "it follows that the change in the value of @xmath53 due to an riii move is of the form @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "we may use the above analysis to show that for any @xmath26 , the invariant @xmath36 is an order one invariant of knot diagrams . rather than giving a general definition of order @xmath1 invariants and then taking @xmath56 , we give the following equivalent definition . +",
    "* definition . *",
    "an invariant on knot diagrams has _",
    "order one _ if whenever we may simultaneously perform two reidemeister moves on a diagram , in two disjoint discs @xmath57 ( that is , configurations as in figure  [ reidmoves ] appear in @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , then the change in the invariant due to the move in @xmath58 is not affected by whether we first perform the move in @xmath59 .    [ too ] for any link invariant @xmath20 , the invariant @xmath24 is an order one invariant .",
    "as seen in the analysis above , the change in the value of @xmath60 due to the reidemeister move in @xmath58 , is determined by the link types obtained by smoothing either one or two crossings in @xmath58 , before and/or after the move in @xmath58 . the reidemeister move performed in @xmath59 ,",
    "if done first , does not affect the link type of these smoothed links , since a reidemeister move in @xmath59 corresponds to an isotopy on the smoothed links .    in the cases where @xmath26 is unchanged when permuting the two components of a link and when reversing the orientation of a link ,",
    "as is true for the invariant @xmath61 , then @xmath28 is independent of the orientation of @xmath14 .",
    "this is true since reversing the orientation of @xmath14 does not effect the smoothing and the sign at each crossing .",
    "it only reverses the orientation of the smoothed links , and interchanges their two components .",
    "so , though the orientation of @xmath14 is used in the computation of @xmath53 , the invariant @xmath53 is an invariant of unoriented diagrams .    the mirror image of a diagram @xmath14 is the diagram obtained from @xmath14 by reversing all of its crossings .",
    "taking the mirror image of a knot diagram @xmath14 has the following effect on @xmath53 .",
    "the smoothing at each crossing is the same , but the sign of all crossings is reversed .",
    "this interchanges the @xmath62 s and @xmath63 s , and reverses all linking numbers .",
    "so , the effect of taking mirror image is given by mapping @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we also note that @xmath53 is additive with respect to the operation of connected sum of diagrams .",
    "let @xmath66 be the set of elements in @xmath67 of the form @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath38 , @xmath41 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and their negatives . by the analysis of section",
    "b , the elements of @xmath66 are precisely the elements of @xmath67 that may appear as the change in the value of @xmath70 when performing a reidemeister move on @xmath14 .",
    "note that @xmath66 generates @xmath67 .",
    "the length of an element of @xmath67 with respect to the generating set @xmath66 is called its _",
    "@xmath66-length_. given two diagrams @xmath71 of the same knot , the @xmath66-length of @xmath72 is a lower bound on the number of reidemeister moves needed to get from @xmath14 to @xmath44 . in particular , if @xmath14 is a diagram of the unknot , then the @xmath66-length of @xmath70 gives a lower bound on the number of reidemeister moves needed to get from @xmath14 to the trivial diagram .",
    "we point out that though we are working in the setting of spherical diagrams , the same lower bounds apply , a fortiori , to planar diagrams .",
    "we now use the above procedure to determine the minimal number of reidemeister moves needed to pass between certain pairs of diagrams of the unknot .     and",
    "its mirror image @xmath5,width=480 ]    let @xmath4 be the knot diagram appearing in figure  [ newdnen ] ( for @xmath73 ) .",
    "it has @xmath3 crossings , where the first @xmath74 crossings , from left to right , are negative , and the following @xmath1 crossings are positive .",
    "let @xmath5 be the knot diagram obtained from @xmath4 by reversing the middle crossing , so that @xmath5 has from left to right , @xmath1 negative crossings followed by @xmath74 positive crossings .",
    "note that @xmath5 is a mirror image of @xmath4 .",
    "the writhes of @xmath4 and @xmath5 differ by two . their winding numbers , crossing numbers and cowrithes are the same ( for definition of cowrithe see section d ) .",
    "so these invariants can only tell us that at least two reidemeister moves are needed to pass between these diagrams .",
    "it is easy to see how to arrive from @xmath4 to @xmath5 with @xmath6 reidemeister moves , namely , perform @xmath1 rii moves and one ri move to arrive from @xmath4 to the trivial diagram , and then one ri move and @xmath1 rii moves to create @xmath5 .",
    "we now prove that there is no shorter way :    [ dnen ] let @xmath75 be the two knot diagrams with @xmath3 crossings appearing in figure  [ newdnen ] .",
    "then the minimal number of reidemeister moves required to arrive from @xmath4 to @xmath5 is @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , any sequence of reidemeister moves realizing this minimum involves precisely two ri moves .",
    "the other @xmath76 moves are of type corresponding to the following four elements of @xmath66 : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , no unmatched rii move may appear .    by direct computation",
    "we see that @xmath81 and @xmath82 so @xmath83 we denote this element by @xmath84 .",
    "we first show that the @xmath66-length of @xmath84 is @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath85 be the homomorphism defined by setting @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for all @xmath89 .",
    "then @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for any @xmath92 .",
    "it follows that the @xmath66-length of @xmath84 is at least @xmath6 .",
    "the sequence of reidemeister moves described above realizes this minimum , namely @xmath93 .",
    "we now show that any presentation of @xmath84 as a sum of @xmath6 elements of @xmath66 involves precisely two terms of the form @xmath33 and/or @xmath94 , and all other @xmath76 terms are of the four types appearing in the statement of the theorem .",
    "let @xmath95 be the homomorphism defined by @xmath96 for all @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath98 and the value of @xmath99 on all other elements of @xmath66 is 0 .",
    "since @xmath100 we see we need at least two terms of the form @xmath33 or @xmath94 to present @xmath84 .",
    "( this is simply a writhe argument , since @xmath101 is the writhe . )",
    "now , let @xmath102 be the homomorphism defined by setting @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for all other @xmath106 . then @xmath107 .",
    "we have @xmath108 , and for all elements of @xmath66 , @xmath109 , where the only elements in @xmath66 for which the value of @xmath110 is precisely 2 are @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "we already know that at least two terms of the form @xmath111 appear in any presentation of @xmath84 , each contributing only 1 to @xmath110 , and so the other @xmath76 terms of a minimal presentation must each contribute @xmath112 in order to get to @xmath113 .",
    "so , the other @xmath76 terms must be of the form @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .    as to the concluding remark ,",
    "since none of these four elements are of the form @xmath114 , no unmatched rii move may appear .",
    "in the proof of theorem dnen we have used three different homomorphisms @xmath115 in order to analyze the element @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath116 and @xmath110 were ad hoc choices constructed especially for this specific @xmath84 .",
    "but as noted , @xmath99 is of general interest , @xmath101 being the writhe of the diagram .",
    "another such substitution is @xmath117 for all @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting diagram invariant @xmath118 is then the crossing number of the diagram . in this section",
    "we are interested in the substitution @xmath119 given by @xmath120 for all @xmath1 . for a knot diagram @xmath14",
    "we denote @xmath121 .",
    "this invariant of knot diagrams appears in @xcite and in @xcite ( with opposite sign ) where it is named the _",
    "cowrithe_. we now study the properties of @xmath122 , and understand its limitations in establishing lower bounds for the number of reidemeister moves between knot diagrams .",
    "we will see that @xmath122 may be presented as @xmath123 where @xmath124 depends only on the knot type of @xmath14 , and @xmath125 depends only on the underlying spherical curve of @xmath14 .",
    "now , if we are interested in the number of reidemeister moves between two diagrams @xmath42 , then all diagrams considered are of the same knot type , so for the sake of this analysis @xmath124 is a constant and we are left with @xmath125 which is only an invariant of the underlying spherical curves .",
    "so any lower bound obtained from @xmath122 to the number of reidemeister moves required to pass between @xmath14 and @xmath44 is in fact a lower bound to the number of moves on curves required to pass between the underlying curves of @xmath14 and @xmath44 . for example",
    ", for the pair @xmath75 of section c , @xmath126 since they are each diagrams of the same knot type and have the same underlying curve , so @xmath122 gives 0 as lower bound .",
    "the invariants @xmath127 referred to , are well known invariants .",
    "@xmath124 is @xmath128 times the coefficient of @xmath129 in the conway polynomial , and @xmath125 is arnold s invariant of spherical curves @xmath130 , normalized to have value 0 on the two curves appearing in figure  [ normalize ] , the circle and the figure eight curve .",
    "( these are representatives of the two regular homotopy classes of immersions of @xmath17 into @xmath8 . )",
    "we denote by @xmath58 the invariant @xmath131 with this normalization .",
    "we mention that arnold originally considered curves in the plane in @xcite , but then observed that his invariants may be defined for curves in @xmath8 .",
    "indeed they are well defined on @xmath8 , since they are locally well defined , as in the plane , and since the components of the space of `` normed '' immersions of @xmath17 into @xmath8 defined in @xcite are simply connected .",
    "let @xmath132 denote the underlying spherical curve of a knot diagram @xmath14 , and let @xmath133 denote the coefficient of @xmath129 in the conway polynomial of the knot represented by @xmath14 .",
    "then the relation mentioned is @xmath134 this relation follows from @xcite , as we will show .",
    "( various similar observations appear in @xcite . )",
    "we then give a self contained proof of this relation , which demonstrates the special properties of @xmath122 and @xmath58 and their relation to the properties of @xmath53 .",
    "we first show that @xmath122 indeed coincides ( up to sign ) with the cowrithe defined in @xcite . to a knot diagram @xmath14",
    "there is attached a chord diagram , where we connect two points of the domain @xmath135 by a straight chord in @xmath136 , if they are mapped into the same point in the diagram @xmath14 . for two crossings @xmath137 in @xmath14 , @xmath138 is a crossing between the two distinct components of @xmath16 precisely when the chords corresponding to @xmath13 and @xmath138 cross in the chord diagram .",
    "we denote this ( symmetric ) relation between @xmath13 and @xmath138 by @xmath139 .",
    "so @xmath138 contributes @xmath140 to @xmath49 according to the sign of @xmath138 which we denote @xmath141 , precisely when @xmath139 .",
    "it follows that @xmath142 from this it follows that @xmath143 ( note that @xmath144 appearing under the summation sign is a set , not an ordered pair . )",
    "we see that indeed @xmath122 is minus the cowrithe .",
    "from these formulas for @xmath49 and @xmath145 we can see how @xmath122 changes under a crossing change .",
    "let @xmath146 be two diagrams differing only by a crossing change at @xmath13 , the crossing at @xmath13 for @xmath147 being positive and negative , respectively , and let @xmath16 be the common smoothing of @xmath148 at @xmath13 .",
    "then the following is clear from the above two formulas :      if an invariant @xmath150 of diagrams satisfies the skein relation appearing in proposition skein , and in addition @xmath151 for any diagram of the unknot , then by k chapter iii it must coincide with @xmath152 .",
    "in fact it is enough that @xmath151 for any descending knot diagram .",
    "define @xmath153 our goal is to show that @xmath154 .",
    "since @xmath155 then by proposition skein we have @xmath156 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath151 for descending diagrams .",
    "this follows directly from @xcite corollary 2 , if one chooses the basepoint required there at the initial point of descent .",
    "we now present a self contained proof that @xmath150 is a knot invariant , by showing that it is invariant under all reidemeister moves .",
    "the proof is independent of @xcite and of the fact that @xmath157 is a knot invariant . knowing that @xmath158 is a knot invariant will also reprove that @xmath159 using the above argument , since @xmath151 for the trivial diagram , and therefore for any diagram of the unknot .",
    "we first note the values of @xmath160 on @xmath66 : @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "we thus see that @xmath122 remains unchanged when a diagram changes by an ri move and an unmatched rii move , and increases by 1 when a diagram changes by a matched rii move . furthermore , @xmath122 changes by @xmath51 when the diagram changes by an riii move , and inspection shows that the change of @xmath167 or @xmath168 precisely coincides with the change of @xmath167 or @xmath168 of arnold s `` strangeness '' invariant @xmath169 for the underlying curve .",
    "two cases are indicated in figure  [ lktopbot ] . for each case",
    "one needs to check both possible cyclic orderings of the three strands along @xmath17 .",
    "all other cases are obtained from these two by reversing the orientation of the middle strand , and by reversing the crossing between the top and bottom strands while adjusting the middle strand accordingly .",
    "so , using the same names for the moves on curves as for the corresponding moves on knot diagrams , we have shown that the change in @xmath145 and @xmath170 is the same under moves rii , riii .    as to ri moves , the change in @xmath122 is 0 , and we now check the change for @xmath58 .",
    "we point out that an ri move on spherical curves changes the regular homotopy class of the curve , and so asking about the change under an ri move is only meaningful when a specific normalization is chosen for the two regular homotopy classes .",
    "now given a smooth general position curve @xmath171 , there is a regular homotopy @xmath172 in @xmath8 taking @xmath173 either to the circle or to the figure eight .",
    "such regular homotopy involves only rii and riii moves , and the sum of contributions of all these moves along @xmath172 is precisely @xmath174 .",
    "let @xmath175 be a curve obtained from @xmath173 by an ri move , and apply the same regular homotopy @xmath172 to @xmath175 , carrying along the added kink .",
    "we experience the same moves along @xmath172 except that occasionally a strand needs to pass the additional kink as in figure  [ 2moves ] . by proposition  [ p1 ]",
    "this occurrence does not change the value of @xmath58 , and so the total contribution of all moves is again @xmath174 .",
    "we arrive at a curve which is obtained from the embedded circle or figure eight by an ri move , and we have verified that the value of @xmath58 on such a curve is 0 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath176 .",
    "proposition p2 establishes that the change due to an ri move is the same for @xmath145 and @xmath170 .",
    "together with the above similar observation regarding rii and riii moves , we see that @xmath177 is invariant under all reidemeister moves , proving that @xmath158 is a knot invariant ."
