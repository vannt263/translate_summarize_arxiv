    "hamiltonian formulation on the light front ( lf ) @xcite leads in quantum field theory to simple description of the vacuum state , that simplifies the nonperturbative hamiltonian approach to the bound state and mass spectrum problem @xcite .",
    "the lf can be defined by the equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 plays the role of time ( @xmath3 are lorentz coordinates with @xmath4 denoting the remaining spatial coordinates ) .",
    "the role of usual space coordinates is played by the lf coordinates @xmath5 .",
    "the generator @xmath6 of translations in @xmath7 is kinematical @xcite ( i.e. it is independent of the interaction and quadratic in fields , as a momentum in a free theory ) .",
    "it is nonnegative ( @xmath8 ) for quantum states with nonnegative mass squared .",
    "so the state with the minimal eigenvalue @xmath9 of the momentum operator @xmath6 can describe ( in the case of the absence of the massless particles ) the vacuum state , and it is also the state minimizing the @xmath10 in lorentz invariant theory .",
    "furthermore it is possible to introduce the fock space on this vacuum and formulate in this space the eigenvalue problem for the operator @xmath10 ( which is the lf hamiltonian ) and find the spectrum of mass @xmath11 in subspaces with fixed values of the momenta @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath13    the theory on the lf has the singularity at @xmath14 , and the simplest regularization is the cutoff @xmath15 .",
    "other convenient translationally invariant regularization , that can treat also zero ( @xmath9 ) modes of fields , is the cutoff @xmath16 plus periodic boundary conditions for fields .",
    "this regularization discretizes the momentum @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and clearly separates zero and nonzero modes .",
    "it is the so - called `` discretized light cone quantization '' ( dlcq ) .",
    "such regularization was successfully used to solve the problem ( [ 1aa ] ) for ( 1 + 1 ) field theories : sine - gordon model @xcite , yukawa model @xcite , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "the significant perturbative analysis of lf ( or infinite - momentum frame ) gauge theory in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions was made in papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the problem of constructing the renormalized lf hamiltonians using , in particular , the above - mentioned regularizations turned out to be very difficult .",
    "we refer to nonperturbative similarity renormalization group ( srg ) approach @xcite which allows to construct approximately effective lf hamiltonians acting in the space of small number of effective ( constituent ) particles @xcite .",
    "all used regularizations of the singularity at @xmath14 are not lorentz invariant .",
    "this can lead to nonequivalence of the results obtained with the lf and the conventional formulation in lorentz coordinates .",
    "it was shown in papers @xcite that some diagrams of the perturbation theory , generated by the lf hamiltonian , and corresponding diagrams of the conventional perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates can differ . in papers",
    "@xcite it was found how to restore the equivalence of the lf and conventional perturbation theories in all orders in the coupling constant by addition of new ( in particular , nonlocal ) terms to the canonical lf hamiltonian .",
    "these terms must remove the above - mentioned differences of diagrams .",
    "the method of the restoration of the equivalence between the lf and conventional perturbation theories , found in @xcite , was applied to constructing of correct renormalized lf hamiltonian for ( 3 + 1)-dimensional quantum chromodynamics @xcite . in the papers @xcite",
    "this method was applied to massive schwinger model ( ( 1 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics ) and correct lf hamiltonian was constructed .",
    "this hamiltonian was used for numerical calculations of the mass spectrum @xcite , and the obtained results well agree with lattice calculations in lorentz coordinates @xcite for all values of the coupling ( including very large ones ) .",
    "the number of the above - mentioned new terms , which must be added to canonical lf hamiltonian , and counterterms , necessary for the ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalization , depends essentially on the regularization scheme . for the case of qcd(3 + 1 ) @xcite in the light - cone gauge one gets the finite number of these terms only in the regularization of the pauli - villars ( pv ) type @xcite .",
    "this regularization violates gauge invariance .",
    "however it was shown in @xcite that gauge invariance can be restored in renormalized lf theory with proper choice of coefficients before these new terms and counterterms .",
    "on the other side , the pv regularization involves the introduction of auxiliary ghost fields ( with the large mass playing the role of the regularization parameter ) .",
    "these ghost fields generate the states with the indefinite metric , and one has to deal with such states in the nonperturbative ( e.g. variational ) calculations using the lf hamiltonian .",
    "attempts to do these calculations were made in papers @xcite for nongauge theories .",
    "it is important to generalize this for gauge theories like qcd ( e.g. for the formulation @xcite , where the pv regularization introduces ghost gauge fields ) .",
    "calculations with truncated lf fock basis within pv regularization were carried out in @xcite .",
    "the generalization of this method allowing to consider the states with infinite number of quanta was proposed in @xcite ( it is the so called lf coupled - cluster ( lfcc ) method ) .",
    "the pv regularization was used , in particular , in covariant light front dynamics ( clfd ) approach @xcite where the truncation of lf fock basis of states and the corresponding renormalization procedure within covariant formulation on the lf were used .",
    "the question of using the pv regularization in the lf hamiltonian approach is nt studied sufficiently .",
    "so we address this question in the present paper . for the investigation of the problem",
    "we start with the construction of the renormalized lf hamiltonian in the pv regularization for the scalar field theory in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time .",
    "we compare the perturbation theory generated by the lf hamiltonian and covariant perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates by the method of papers @xcite .",
    "this allows to find the counterterm necessary for the renormalization of the lf hamiltonian by the calculation of the divergent part of the corresponding diagram in the covariant perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates .",
    "let us note that there is the possibility to carry out the renormalization directly in @xmath19-ordered perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "however the renormalized theory on the lf at that approach can , in principle , turn out to be nonequivalent to the original lorentz covariant theory due to possible differences between finite diagrams generated by the lf hamiltonian and corresponding to them covariant diagrams .    to take into account the different vacua appearing in considered model due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking we consider the transition to the lf hamiltonian from the theories quantized on the spacelike planes approaching to the lf . in these theories it is possible to determine the true vacuum using the gaussian approximation @xcite .",
    "accordingly we get two different expressions for the lf hamiltonian for the cases without and with the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "let us note that this problem can be related to zero mode problem on the lf @xcite . also we note that the description of spontaneous symmetry breaking within the theory on the lf was considered for the standard model in the paper @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ sec:1 ] we formulate the scalar field theory in the coordinates corresponding to the spacelike planes approaching to the lf and solve the vacuum problem in the gaussian approximation . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we investigate the perturbation theory for this model . using the pv regularization",
    "we prove the coincidence of the diagrams of the perturbation theory , generated by the lf hamiltonian , and the corresponding diagrams of the covariant perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates in the limit of removing the lf momentum cutoff ( i.e. @xmath20 ) . in the concluding sect .",
    "[ concl ] we consider a way to solve the eigenvalue problem for obtained lf hamiltonians .",
    "also we discuss the possible generalization of this way to qcd and the approach related to the ads / qcd correspondence @xcite .",
    "appendix a contains the calculation of the divergent part of the diagram that defines the counterterm which renormalizes the theory .",
    "appendix b gives the example of a comparison of diagram calculations in lf and conventional covariant formulations .",
    "to clarify the way of the construction of the lf hamiltonian we start from the lagrangian formulation in the coordinates @xmath21 approaching the lf coordinates @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a small parameter .",
    "the lagrangian density of the conventional scalar field theory can be written in these coordinates as follows @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a mass parameter ( the bare mass ) .",
    "the equation @xmath27 defines the space - like plane , so the canonical quantization on this plane is equivalent to the ordinary quantization on the @xmath28 plane in lorentz coordinates . from the lagrangian ( [ 4 ] ) we obtain the following hamiltonian density : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the momentum canonically conjugated to the field @xmath31 , the @xmath32 .",
    "further we consider the transition from the theories with the hamiltonians ( [ 5 ] ) taken at different values of the parameter @xmath33 , to the lf hamiltonian in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "this gives a possibility to take into account ( before reaching the lf ) two different vacua existing in this model .",
    "indeed , at @xmath35 we still can use known methods @xcite for the description of the quantum vacuum .",
    "in particular we can apply the variational method @xcite to find the minimum of the vacuum average of the hamiltonian density .",
    "this method uses different fock vacua and bogolyubov transformations from one fock vacuum to another ( this method corresponds to the `` gaussian '' variational approximation to the vacuum wave function ) .",
    "let us apply this method to the hamiltonian density ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "we introduce the following expressions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( at @xmath27 ) : @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here",
    "we define the creation and annihilation operators corresponding to the varying fock vacua @xmath42 : @xmath43 = \\delta^{(2)}(k - k^ { ' } ) , \\,\\,\\ , [ a(k),a(k^ { ' } ) ] = 0 .",

    "the variation of the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 is equivalent to linear transformations of operators @xmath47 that is equivalent to the variation of the vacuum state vector @xmath42 in the assumed approximation .",
    "we implicitly suppose that the integration domain in the @xmath48 is limited by the cutoff @xmath49 .",
    "it is related to the necessity to get in the limit @xmath34 the theory on the lf which is regularized by the cutoff @xmath50 .",
    "further we substitute the expressions ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) and use the equalities ( [ 7a ] ) .",
    "we obtain the following result : @xmath51 this expression contains divergent integrals .",
    "so we introduce the regularization of these integrals by a cutoff in the momenta . varying the quantity ( [ 8 ] ) w.r.t . @xmath44 and equating the result to zero we get @xmath52 using the definition @xmath53 we obtain @xmath54 below we show that @xmath55 can be chosen to be finite in the regularization removing limit .    the variation of eq .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) ) .    to find the form of the lf hamiltonian let us consider the eigenvalue problem : @xmath111 where the @xmath112 is the hamiltonian ( [ 16 ] ) or ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "one can expand these hamiltonians in powers of the parameter @xmath33 .",
    "we separate the @xmath113 term of these hamiltonians and write them in the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 in the derivation of this expression we use the equality @xmath116 following from the eq .",

    "we denote by @xmath129 the field on the lf , @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "the operators @xmath132 and @xmath133 play the role of creation and annihilation operators in the lf fock space . they satisfy canonical commutation relations on the lf .",

    "( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) ( see the text before eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) ) .",
    "in the previous section we have obtained in gaussian approximation the lf hamiltonians ( [ 24 ] ) , ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "the theories described by these lf hamiltonians contain uv divergences . to study these divergences and carry out the renormalization",
    "let us compare the perturbation theories , generated by these lf hamiltonians , with the corresponding renormalized covariant perturbation theories in lorentz coordinates ( in all orders ) . with this aim",
    "we consider the covariant perturbation theory for the lagrangian in the following general form ( in lorentz coordinates ) : @xmath135 standard analysis shows that this theory is superrenormalizable , i.e. it has only finite number of divergent diagrams which must be renormalized .",
    "these diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the sum of all connected diagrams with one external line ( `` tadpole '' diagrams ) gives the one - point green function .",
    "it is a constant in the coordinate space and is equal to the vacuum average of the field @xmath36 .",
    "so one can make this constant to be equal to zero by the shift of the field : @xmath136 , where @xmath45 is the constant . in this way we obtain the theory without tadpole diagrams ( and subdiagrams ) .",
    "the linear in the field term of the lagrangian ( [ s1 ] ) generates only the tadpole subdiagrams .",
    "therefore if we consider the perturbation theory without tadpole subdiagrams , we can ignore this term in the lagrangian .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 in the lagrangian ( [ s1 ] ) does not change after the shift in the field , while the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath137 do change .",
    "the diagrams with two external lines joined to one vertex ( we denote them by diagrams ) do not depend on external momenta .",
    "all such connected diagrams are one - particle - irreducible ones ( in the absence of the tadpole subdiagrams ) , and their contribution is equivalent to the addition of the counterterm , quadratic in the field , to the lagrangian . in this way one can formulate the perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates without tadpole and diagrams ( and corresponding subdiagrams ) .",
    "then we have only one logarithmically divergent diagram , the divergent part of which must be compensated by the counterterm quadratic in the field .",
    "this diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ]  ( f ) , and in the following we denote it by @xmath138 .",
    "further we choose the pv method for the regularization of the obtained perturbation theory .",
    "this choice requires the introduction of the auxiliary large mass @xmath139 ghost field @xmath140 into the lagrangian .",
    "thus we can generate the considered perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates by the following regularized lagrangian if we throw away all tadpole and diagrams : @xmath141 here the mass @xmath139 is the regularization parameter , and the quadratic in the field @xmath142 counterterm is added to compensate the divergent part of the diagram @xmath138 at @xmath143 .",
    "this divergent part is calculated in appendix a.    now let us write the canonical hamiltonian on the lf , corresponding to this lagrangian , and take this hamiltonian in the normally ordered form ( in accordance with the absence of the tadpole and diagrams in the previously considered perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates ) : @xmath144 here we introduce , like in the eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) , the regularization parameter @xmath134 for the fourier decomposition of fields @xmath36 and @xmath145 in terms of creation and annihilation operators on the lf , and again denote these regularized fields by @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the canonical commutation relations for the ghost creation and annihilation operators have the opposite sign w.r.t . conventional ones ) . ] .",
    "starting from this hamiltonian we can generate the same set of diagrams as in covariant perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates .",
    "indeed , it was proven in paper  @xcite that each term in covariant perturbation theory ( i.e. feynman diagram ) can be written as the sum of terms in the @xmath19-ordered ( `` old - fashioned '' ) perturbation theory series .",
    "but the difference is contained in the way of calculation of diagrams : for lf perturbation theory the integration must be carried out firstly over the momenta @xmath148 and the condition @xmath149 must be introduced as the regularization of fields in eq .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) .",
    "let us remark that this way of calculation gives all tadpole and diagrams equal to zero .",
    "indeed , the tadpole diagrams are absent",
    "because the momentum of the external line of these diagrams is equal to zero but the regularization of fields on the lf ( @xmath149 ) does nt allow such external momentum .",
    "diagrams are equal zero because in such a diagram there is always a closed loop that has the same sign of the loop momentum @xmath150 in all its propagators . as the result",
    "the residue integral w.r.t .",
    "corresponding loop momentum @xmath151 is equal to zero , because all poles related to these propagators lie on the same side of the real axis of @xmath151 .",
    "two divergent diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ]  ( d ) ,  ( e ) are absent due to normal ordering of the hamiltonian ( [ s3 ] ) .",
    "so the set of nonzero diagrams turns out to be the same in perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates and that generated by the hamiltonian on the lf .",
    "however it is known that the corresponding diagrams calculated in each of these perturbation theories can differ @xcite .",
    "one can use the method of the papers @xcite to compare such diagrams in all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the idea of this method is the following .",
    "the diagrams generated by the lf hamiltonian are regularized with the @xmath149 cutoff .",
    "therefore the difference between the result of calculation of such a diagram and the result of calculation of the corresponding covariant diagram in lorentz coordinates reduces to the integrals over the region @xmath152 of each propagator . if one makes for each loop momentum @xmath153 ( which can be always identified with a some propagator momentum ) the change @xmath154 ,",
    "@xmath155 an essential dependence on @xmath134 in the integration region disappears , and one can investigate the behavior of the integrand at @xmath66 for an arbitrarily complicated diagram using only general properties of the theory ( lorentz invariance , the spin of the field , the structure of the propagator , etc . ) . with this method",
    "it is possible to prove for our model that the results of calculation of any diagram in the lf perturbation theory and in the covariant perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates coincide in the limit @xmath20 ( taking into account the absence of tadpole and diagrams ) . in appendix",
    "b we illustrate how this method works with the example of one - loop diagram .",
    "thus the theory with the lf hamiltonian ( [ s3 ] ) turns out to be equivalent in all orders of perturbation theory to the conventional renormalized covariant perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates in the limit @xmath66 ( and then @xmath143 ) .",
    "therefore the eq .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) gives the perturbatively renormalized lf hamiltonian .",
    "we notice that the lf hamiltonian ( [ s3 ] ) can be considered , at definite choice of its parameters , as one of the lf hamiltonians ( [ 24 ] ) , ( [ 26 ] ) , correspondingly regularized and renormalized .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath156 can be identified with @xmath157 ( @xmath104 or @xmath158 ) , while @xmath159 can be identified with @xmath102 or @xmath103 for the lf hamiltonians ( [ 24 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) respectively .",
    "thus we obtain the renormalized lf hamiltonians for the cases without and with the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath86 satisfy the inequalities ( [ 15 ] ) in the gaussian approximation .",
    "nevertheless one can assume that these inequalities are approximately valid for the renormalized lf hamiltonians in the pv regularization .",
    "in the present paper we have constructed the renormalized lf hamiltonian for the @xmath160 model in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time . we have found the explicit expression for the counterterm , necessary for the renormalization , using the pv regularization . to do this we compare the diagrams of the covariant perturbation theory in lorentz",
    "coordinates with the analogous diagrams of the perturbation theory generated by the lf hamiltonian which has also the cutoff in the momentum @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "we show that both perturbation theories can be described by the same set of diagrams , with the values of the compared diagrams coinciding in the limit @xmath163 .",
    "then we renormalize the lf hamiltonian by the counterterm found in the calculation of the divergent part of the corresponding diagram in the covariant perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates .",
    "furthermore we have taken into account the possibility of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in this model and obtained the lf hamiltonians corresponding to two different vacua .",
    "we arrive at these lf hamiltonians by considering the limit transition from the theories quantized on the spacelike planes approaching the lf .",
    "it is possible to describe the vacuum on these planes using the gaussian approximation .",
    "the hamiltonians obtained with this approximation still require uv renormalization . and the above - mentioned comparison of perturbative theories , generated by these lf hamiltonians , and the covariant perturbation theory in lorentz coordinates allows to renormalize both of these hamiltonians in the pv regularization .",
    "having such lf hamiltonians one can start nonperturbative calculation of the mass spectrum solving the eigenvalue problem : @xmath164 this calculation could help to study the peculiarities of the pv regularization related to the presence of ghost fields and states with the indefinite metric .",
    "that is important for the application of this method to qcd .    to solve the eigenvalue problem ( [ 28 ] )",
    "nonperturbatively one can apply numerical approach using the discretization of the momenta : @xmath165 ; @xmath166 , @xmath167 this discretization is achieved by introducing the limits @xmath168 , @xmath169 and corresponding periodic boundary conditions for fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "one can assume that such extrapolation may be done at every fixed values of @xmath139 , @xmath177 and lattice parameter .",
    "it must be noticed that in such calculations zero modes of fields ( @xmath9 ) , playing important role for correct description of possible vacuum effects @xcite , are excluded because in the considered scalar field theory the effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking can be approximately taken into account . in gauge theories like qcd",

    "for the renormalization of our model in the conventional feynman covariant perturbation theory it is necessary to consider only one logarithmically divergent diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ]  ( f ) ) .",
    "this diagram in the pv regularization has the following form : @xmath178 where the integration is over the euclidean momenta , the parameter @xmath11 is the mass parameter , the @xmath139 is pv regularization parameter , the factor @xmath179 includes the symmetry coefficient 1/6 of this diagram ( the factor @xmath180 is related to the definition of the coupling @xmath86 in the lagrangian ( [ s1 ] ) ) . to find the counterterm we need to calculate only the divergent ( at @xmath181 ) part of the @xmath182 .",
    "this divergent part can be evaluated as the divergent part of the @xmath183 which can be rewritten in the following form : @xmath184 we can use the well - known result : @xmath185 to obtain this result it is sufficient to put @xmath186 and evaluate residue integral : @xmath187 further we substitute this result into eq .",
    "( [ a35 ] ) : @xmath188 the first and third integrals in this expression are finite constants at @xmath143 , and therefore , the @xmath189 can be rewritten as follows : @xmath190 the first two integrals in this expression are finite constants at @xmath143 , thus we obtain for @xmath189 the following result : @xmath191 using this result one can find the corresponding counterterm in the standard way @xcite .",
    "this counterterm is present in the eqs .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) and ( [ s3 ] ) .",
    "let us demonstrate how the method of comparison of calculations in lf and usual covariant perturbation theory @xcite works using as an example the 1-loop diagram with two external lines .",
    "let us write the corresponding integrand in the following form : @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath153 are external and loop momenta respectively .    in the calculation of diagrams in usual covariant perturbation theory",
    "the integration is carried out over all momenta @xmath194 while in the lf calculation the integration is only over the domain @xmath195 due to the regularization of fields in eq .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) .",
    "so the difference between the lf and the conventional covariant calculations of the diagram is given by the integral over the domain @xmath196 .",
    "this domain consists of two parts and the contribution of each of them should be considered separately . however",
    "the contribution of the second part becomes similar to one of the first part after the change @xmath197 .",
    "so we consider the integration only over the first part of the integration domain : @xmath198 after the change @xmath199 , @xmath200 this integral takes the form : @xmath201 the integration domain is now independent on @xmath134 while the expression for the integrand can be easily analyzed in the @xmath66 limit .",
    "we see that in this limit the integral ( [ b3 ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "if we add in the expression ( [ b1 ] ) the factor @xmath151 in the numerator ( as e.g. in fermion self - energy diagram in yukawa model , see @xcite ) we get after the change @xmath200 the additional factor @xmath202 .",
    "so we obtain nonzero result for the difference between lf and conventional covariant calculations of such diagram .",
    "we see that the dependence on the external momenta factorizes in this result for the considered difference .",
    "such factorization usually has place also in higher orders of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this gives a possibility to determine the form of necessary counterterms which must be added to the canonical lf hamiltonian to remove the above - mentioned difference .",
