    "it follows directly from the definition of the permanent that @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the set of all acceptable subobjects of @xmath242 where each degree equals @xmath0 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath265 we will prove it by constructing a partition of acceptable subobjects of @xmath242 where each vertex has degree 2 , and associating each partition class which contributes non - zero to @xmath266 with uniquelly determined super subobject of @xmath243 .",

    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath298 on the other hand , @xmath299 , where @xmath300 is the set of all acceptable objects where each degree is 0 or 2 ( loops are allowed and they contribute 2 to the degree ) .",
    "first observe that the contribution of the acceptable objects of @xmath300 that contain a red arc cancels out since we can change the orientation of a red arc in such an object , and get again an object of @xmath300 , with oposite contribution .",
