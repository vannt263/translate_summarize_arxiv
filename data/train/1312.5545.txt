    "topologically frustrated systems offer unexpected properties which have been studied recently in magnetic materials .",
    "a particular exciting system is artificial spin ice with its ` exotic ' magnetic ground state @xcite .",
    "artificial spin ice is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) array of magnetic nanoislands fabricated with desired geometries .",
    "the nanoislands are typically elongated to show a single - domain state ; their magnetic moments then point in one of two directions .",
    "being isolated from each other , e.g. , separated by a distance in the order of several hundred nanometer , they are coupled by the long - range dipole - dipole interaction .    the systems sketched above are known for low - temperature fractionalization : they exhibit collective excitations that carry only a fraction of the elementary constituent s properties .",
    "these appear due to the absence of a unique ground state and due to the violation of the ` two - in - two - out ' ice rule , the latter proposed by pauling for the proton ordering in water ice @xcite .",
    "collective excitations appear as ferromagnetically aligned nanoislands ( ` strings ' ) with end points ( ` nodes ' or ` vortices ' ) that behave like magnetic charges , known as nambu magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "the oppositely charged end nodes of the strings interact with each other with a distance dependence of a coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "the properties of these artificial magnetic monopoles are studied theoretically as well as experimentally with great effort .",
    "we recall that magnetic monopoles would ` symmetrize ' electrodynamics with respect to the electric and the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "improvements in nanolithography allow to design artificial spin ice in 2d structures like honeycomb ( kagom ice ) @xcite , brickwork @xcite , triangular @xcite , and pentagonal @xcite lattices .",
    "a three - dimensional artificial spin ice can be realized , e.g. , by a layer - by - layer synthesis @xcite .",
    "local modifications in the otherwise perfect array are introduced by local nanolithography @xcite .",
    "these perturbations , considered as defects , modify significantly the properties of the system @xcite .",
    "this leads to a question on the role of defects in dipolar arrays concerning thermal excitations . for three - dimensional spin ice and pyrochlore lattices ,",
    "defects have already been studied by jaubert @xcite .",
    "first investigations of defects in 2d artificial spin ice have been performed by silva et al .",
    "@xcite who investigated the interaction between magnetic string excitations caused by defects and nambu string excitations",
    ". since defects can serve as pinning centers in magnetic materials@xcite , it is conceivable to influence and control magnetic monopoles and the associated string excitations by tailoring the defects properties .    experimentally , effective thermal excitations in artificial square dipolar arrays can for example be provided by field protocols@xcite of vibro - fluidized granular matter , allowing investigations of the short - range magnetic order .",
    "long - range ordered ground states in square - lattice spin ice were obtained by thermal annealing during the fabrication @xcite , which is recommended for magnetic monopoles of charges @xmath0 .",
    "charges of @xmath1 were not observed , which is attributed to the nanoislands geometry .",
    "recent investigations on artificial spin ice with reduced nanoislands dimension @xcite proved thermal excitations at room temperature , which allows not only to observe but also to control excitations with large magnetic charges .    in this work ,",
    "we study various defect types in square - lattice artificial spin ice , with a focus on magnetic excitations .",
    "we consider modifications of two nanoislands of a vortex as a defect : _",
    "( i ) _ removal of two islands from the vortex , _",
    "( ii ) _ a vertical displacement of two islands , _ ( iii ) _ a modification of the islands thickness or _",
    "( iv ) _ of their magnetization density .",
    "furthermore , two defects with predefined positions and properties have been introduced into the spin ice .",
    "the resulting string excitations that link these defects are analyzed with respect to defect position and string length .",
    "magnetic ground states have been achieved by monte carlo simulations for given temperatures @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "theoretical aspects are presented in section  [ sec : theory ] . in the discussion of the results , given in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we address randomly distributed vacancies ( [ sec : vacancies ] ) before analyzing one or two defects with prescribed properties ( [ sec : defects ] ) .",
    "we conclude with section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we build up the artificial spin ice by nanomagnets whose dimension has been taken from ref .",
    "( length @xmath2{nm}$ ] , width @xmath3{nm}$ ] , and height @xmath4{nm}$ ] ) .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath5 of the square lattice @xcite is @xmath6{nm}$ ] ( the lattice spacing in ref .   is @xmath7{nm}$ ] ) .",
    "the magnetic single - domain state of each elongated nanoisland is described by a magnetization vector @xmath8 ( ` spin ' ) aligned along the large island axis . for islands made of permalloy , @xmath9{a m^{-1}}$ ] .",
    "four islands that form a cross introduce a node ( ` vortex ' ; cf .",
    "[ fig : defect]a ) .",
    "the number of spins pointing toward the node s center @xmath10 define the charge @xmath11 of that node ( @xmath12 ; for example , @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : defect]a ) . to quantify thermal activation",
    ", we introduce the fraction of nodes with charge @xmath11 in the sample , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 number of nodes with four adjacent islands in the sample ) ; on average @xmath16 . a path of ferromagnetically aligned nanoislands that connects a pair of nodes with opposite non - zero charges is called a ` string excitation ' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : string ] ) .    .",
    "]    instead approximating the nanomagnets as points@xcite or dipolar needles@xcite , we compute the dipole - dipole interaction energies for realistic shapes .",
    "this is done numerically , allowing in principle for arbitrarily shaped nanoislands .",
    "it turns out that the dipolar interaction@xcite is relevant only for first- ( 1nn ) and for second - nearest ( 2nn ) neighbors,@xcite with energies @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the interaction energies @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be modified in various ways : by _",
    "( i ) _ introducing vacancies ( i.e. , removal of two islands from a node ) , _ ( ii ) _ modifying an island s magnetization density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : defect]a ) , _ ( iii ) _ varying the vertical displacement @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : defect]b ) , and _",
    "( iv ) _ increasing an island s thickness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : defect]c ) .",
    "these modifications keep the charges @xmath11 even .",
    "local modifications of the free - energy landscape are achieved by introducing defects into the dipolar arrays .    to obtain a magnetic ground state",
    ", we use monte carlo simulations based on the metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "the energy barrier @xmath20 between the two possible magnetization states @xmath8 of the nanoislands is considered .",
    "a slight reduction of the temperature in each step drives the system toward a free - energy minimum by successively reversing the islands spins .",
    "a typical monte carlo simulation comprises at least 100000 steps . in this paper",
    ", we report on results for lattices with @xmath21 cells and with @xmath22 cells , each with @xmath23 nanomagnets ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) .",
    "these samples are large enough to suppress even minute finite - size effects , as has been checked by comparison with calculations for larger arrays .",
    "the magnetic ground state of artificial spin ice at small finite temperature ( @xmath26{k}$ ] ) is dictated by the ( spin ) ice rule : at a node with center @xmath10 , two spins pointing inward and two spins pointing outward ( ` 2in2out ' rule , @xmath13 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath27{\\%}$ ] . determined by the interaction energies @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the ground state is ` 2in2outop ' for @xmath28 , in agreement with earlier work ( e.g. , ref .  ) ; it shows inward pointing spins at opposite ( ` op ' ) nanomagnets .",
    "this state shows a degree of degeneracy of @xmath23 , with the energy @xmath29 ( @xmath30 number of spins in the sample ) .",
    "the configuration ` 2in2outad ' has an energy of @xmath31 , is four - fold degenerate , and consists of inward pointing spins at adjacent ( ` ad ' ) islands @xcite .",
    "the ` 2in2outop ' configuration imposes a vortex structure described by a @xmath32 magnetic unit cell ( cf .  the checkerboard structure on the left - hand side of fig .  [ fig : vortex ] ) .",
    "while for ` 2in2outop ' a vortex chirality can be ascribed to each plaquette , this is not the case for the ` 2in2outad ' configuration .",
    "consequently , the latter displays a @xmath33 magnetic unit cell ( on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex ] ) .",
    "magnetic unit cell .",
    "the vortex in the center of the unit cell shows opposite chirality ( brighter circles ) with respect to those at the corners .",
    "right : ` 2in2outad ' configuration with @xmath34 magnetic unit cell .",
    "plaquettes at the edge centers of the unit cell do not exhibit flux closure . ]    by displacing vertically the rows and columns of the square lattice , the degeneracies of the above configurations can be tuned to @xmath35 for a critical @xmath36 ( ref .  ) , that is , to the same degree of degeneracy as in water ice@xcite , in pyrochlore lattices@xcite , and in kagom lattices@xcite ( in the honeycomb and square lattice this sixfold degeneracy is out of 8 and 16 possible vertices , respectively .",
    "however , one may consider both lattices and their magnetic ground states equivalent because both have the same residual entropy of @xmath37 ; cf .",
    "ref .  ) .",
    "consequently , a transition from @xmath38 to @xmath33 ordering takes place at this critical displacement . for @xmath39 , ` 2in2outop ' nodes prevail , while for @xmath40 , ` 2in2outad ' vortices prevail .",
    "the critical value @xmath36 depends on the islands shape : @xmath41 for the realistic shapes used in this investigation ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) , @xmath42 in ref .  , and @xmath43 in ref .",
    "in what follows , we distinguish two types of arrays : @xmath44 has @xmath28 , a vanishing residual ( zero - temperature ) entropy and exhibits the ` 2in2outop ' ground state .",
    "in contrast , @xmath45 has the critical @xmath46 , shows a residual , finite entropy of @xmath47 ( ref .  ) and its ground state is comprised of ` 2in2outop ' and ` 2in2outad ' vortices .",
    "the temperature is @xmath48{k}$ ] ( room temperature ) .      for discussing the role of vacancies ,",
    "we distribute randomly vacancies by removing nanoislands from dipolar arrays of type @xmath44 with @xmath49 .",
    "the vacancy concentration is @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "nodes at which one or three islands are left introduce charges @xmath51 ; these nodes are not considered in the following , for we focus on nodes with charges of @xmath1 .",
    "removing a single island from a node reduces the energy of this defect by a factor of @xmath23 with respect to the unchanged node ; the degree of degeneracy remains unaltered .",
    "it turns out that nodes with reduced exchange coupling among the islands result in a minute increase of the number of nodes with @xmath52 .",
    "more precisely , the fractions of charges @xmath53 increase with the concentration @xmath54 by about @xmath55{\\%}$ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vacancies ] ; the data shown are averages over @xmath56 ensembles and 100 monte carlo runs ) .",
    "the minute increase of @xmath57 is attributed to the exponentially reduced number of contributing nodes , i.e. , those with four islands ( inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : vacancies ] ) .",
    "the roughly linear behavior of @xmath58 suggests that defective nodes and nodes next to the defects do not longer obey the ice rule ; consequently , transitions between close energy levels appear .",
    "an analysis of the charge correlation function which probes the number of pairs of nodes with a distance @xmath59 ( not shown here ) yields no spatial correlation between high magnetic excitations and vacancies .    in a recent investigation , silva et al .",
    "@xcite report that low magnetic charges ( e.g. , two in / one out and one in / two out vortex states ) pinned at vacancies obey strong coulomb interactions .",
    "a second energy contribution , introduced _ ad hoc _ , describes the interaction of string excitations with the defect .",
    "the coulomb - type and the _ ad hoc _ contribution are in the order of @xmath60{mev}$ ] and , thus , too small to be resolved at room temperature ( which corresponds to a thermal energy of about @xmath61{mev}$ ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that a distribution of vacancies , either random or controlled , does neither produce a significant enhancement nor allows control of thermally excited charges @xmath1 . therefore , we now turn to defects with modified island properties .",
    "the degree of frustration is a driving factor for enlarged ratios @xmath57 ( e.g. , shown in ref .  ) .",
    "this suggests to add defects , that is , nodes with modified properties with respect to the ideal dipolar array , at specified positions and with prescribed properties .",
    "these defect nodes comprise nanoislands with modified magnetization density , thickness or vertical displacement ( section  [ sec : theory ] and fig .  [ fig : defect ] ) .",
    "if these modified nodes would pin excitations with charges @xmath1 , one could expect string excitations that connect a pair of defects . in the following , @xmath62 .",
    "first , we show that defects pin charges of @xmath1 .",
    "the probability @xmath63 of finding a magnetic charge @xmath1 at a defect depends on the defect s properties : the magnetization @xmath64 , the vertical displacement @xmath19 , and the islands thickness @xmath65 . for a lattice of type",
    "@xmath44 it increases exponentially up to @xmath4{\\%}$ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : properties]b and c ) or even up to @xmath66{\\%}$ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : properties]a ) . a decrease of @xmath64 and @xmath54 results in an increase of @xmath63 .",
    "the opposite behavior is found for @xmath19 , a finding corroborating that a lattice with a globally increased @xmath19 shows larger fractions @xmath57 . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : properties ] are averages over @xmath67 monte carlo sets and @xmath68 ensembles .    in view of the entire dipolar array ,",
    "the probability of finding a @xmath52 node at a defect is two orders of magnitude larger than that for finding such a node in the rest of the system ( @xmath69{\\%}$ ] ) .",
    "this finding supports that defects are efficient pinning centers and corroborates the _ ad hoc _ interaction between defects and magnetic charges motivated in ref .  .",
    "furthermore , the mean absolute value @xmath70 for a defect yields that magnetic charges @xmath0 are most likely ( insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : properties ] ) , in accordance with experiment @xcite .",
    "hence , the spin - ice rule does not apply even for minor deviations from the ideal lattice and at finite temperature .",
    "the next step is to show that excitations with @xmath52 are simultaneously present at a pair of defects . to illuminate this issue , we choose two defects , d1 and d2 , with magnetization @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : properties]a ) positioned on a straight line along the rows or columns .",
    "the distance between the defects is @xmath72 .",
    "a quantitative analysis is provided by the charge - correlation function @xmath73 which is the probability of finding a charge @xmath11 in a distance @xmath59 from the defect d1 for a given @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath74 shows two maxima ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distancedefects ] ) .",
    "the largest peak is at @xmath75 ( not shown ) , indicating the trivial ` self - correlation ' of a defect .",
    "more importantly , maxima appear at @xmath76 , that is , charges @xmath52 show up simultaneously at the two defects .",
    "furthermore , the probability of finding thermal excitations with @xmath52 and @xmath77 ( not shown here ) at the defects is enhanced with respect to the ideal array . from the amplitude of this peak in @xmath78",
    "we deduce a correlation length of up to four nearest - neighbor distances , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "on top of the above correlation analysis we investigated the charge correlation function for oppositely charged defects .",
    "again , we find maxima at @xmath76",
    ". please recall that string excitations are links between oppositely charged nodes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : string ] ) .",
    "the charge correlation function @xmath78 makes no statement about a ferromagnetic string connecting the two defects , as has been found in kagom and square - lattice spin ices @xcite .",
    "however , the maxima at @xmath76 strongly suggest such links . in the following",
    "we will discuss string excitations connecting two defects .",
    "as suggested above , we find that two defects are connected by string excitations .",
    "the string length @xmath79 is approximately twice as large as the distance of the defects @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lengthdiracstring ] ) .",
    "this result is explained by the topology of the square array . in arrays of type @xmath44 with zero residual entropy ,",
    "the dominant ` 2in2outop ' configuration induces a @xmath38 arrangement of vortices ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex]a ) , the number of string configurations is given by the random walk result @xmath80 , where @xmath5 is the lattice constant .",
    "we use an @xmath81-ary tree scheme@xcite to obtain the shortest ferromagnetic string by iteratively increasing the length @xmath79 . ] .",
    "thus , the shortest link between two defects is a ` zig - zag ' path ( cf .",
    "[ fig : string ] ) . for defects at a distance @xmath72 which is an odd multiple of the lattice constant @xmath5 , this ` zig - zag ' is compatible with the @xmath38 structure .",
    "for example , defects at a distance of @xmath82 are joined by a string of minimal length @xmath83 , whereas those at a distance of @xmath84 by @xmath85 : @xmath86 .",
    "in contrast , defects at distances that are even multiples require a breaking of the flux closure near the defects , which in turn increases the string energy . as a consequence ,",
    "the probability of finding shortest strings is large for defects at an ` odd ' distance , but small for defects at an ` even ' distance ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : lengthdiracstring ] ) .",
    "the above topological restriction does not hold for arrays of type @xmath45 with nonzero residual entropy because the ` 2in2outop ' and ` 2in2outad ' configurations are equally likely . as a result ,",
    "such samples show both @xmath32 and @xmath34 arrangements of the vortices ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex ] ) .",
    "a ` minimal ' string is then a straight line that is offset by one column next to the direct connection of the defects ; its length is @xmath87 . note that a direct connection , with @xmath88 , is unlikely because of the @xmath32 arrangement of the flux closure .    as suggested by ml et al .",
    "( ref .  ) , the energetics include a nonzero string tension , which is described by a potential @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 is the string tension , and @xmath54 is associated with the monopole - pair creation .",
    "consequently , a ` minimal ' string minimizes the energy .",
    "for deducing the string tension for a given sample at a finite temperature , the system should be thermally stable ; this suggests to use type @xmath44 rather than the thermally active type @xmath45 ( cf",
    ".  refs .  , , and for a discussion ) .",
    "we have compared the average energy with and without defects for both types @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in accordance with castelnovo et",
    "@xcite and ml et al .",
    "@xcite , a maximum shows up at about @xmath91 .",
    "a shift of the energy maximum which is related to the coulomb contribution from other strings was not observed , in contrast to a prediction by silva et al .",
    "this is explained by the marginal probability to find other @xmath1 charges in the @xmath44 dipolar array .",
    "moreover , the string tension ` softens ' with temperature , thus , confirming a statement given in ref .  .",
    "the thermal energy of about @xmath61{mev}$ ] ( room temperature is chosen for this paper ) is too large to resolve the coulomb - type contribution @xmath92 ( ref .  )",
    "which is in the order of @xmath93{mev}$ ] .",
    "eventually , we address briefly the modification of the defects .",
    "since all modifications change the dipolar interaction energies ( with respect to the ideal array ) , one can obtain prescribed energies by all modifications discussed in this paper . analytical calculations for which we assume islands without lateral extension , yield that the magnetization fulfills @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the magnetization and the thickness of an unperturbed island , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the vertical displacement @xmath19 and the magnetization are linked : @xmath97 , with @xmath98 .",
    "numerical calculations for realistic island shapes give @xmath99 and a minute deviation from the above linearity in @xmath64 versus @xmath65 .",
    "in this theoretical investigations we have shown that thermal string excitations can be pinned at modified nanomagnets in a dipolar array . the different types of defects may be produced by microstructuring techniques .",
    "it turned out that a decrease of the islands magnetization density is most efficient in creating nodes with large charges . on top of this , a pair of defects is connected by a ferromagnetic path of islands , that is , by a string excitation .",
    "the length of the pinned strings is closely related to magnetic ground state configuration and to the position of the defects .",
    "this finding suggests experimental and theoretical investigations of topology and formation of magnetic domains ."
