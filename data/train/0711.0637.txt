    "fermionic or bosonic particles confined in manmade devices , i.e. , electrons in two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dots ( qds , referred to also as artificial atoms ) or ultracold atoms in harmonic traps , can localize and form structures with molecular , or crystalline , characteristics .",
    "these molecular states of localized particles differ in an essential way from the electronic - shell - structure picture of delocalized electrons filling successive orbitals in a central - mean - field potential ( the aufbau principle ) , familiar from the many - body theory of natural atoms and the mendeleev periodic table ; they also present a different regime from that exhibited by a bose - einstein condensate ( bec , associated often with the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation ) .",
    "the molecular states originate from strong correlations between the constituent repelling particles and they are called electron ( and often wigner ) or boson molecules .    such molecular states forming within a _ single confining potential well _ constitute new phases of matter and allow for investigations of novel strongly - correlated phenomena arising in physical systems with a range of materials characteristics unavailable experimentally ( and theoretically unexplored ) until recently .",
    "one example is the range of values of the socalled wigner parameter ( denoted as @xmath0 for charged particles and @xmath1 for neutral ones , see ) which expresses the relative strength of the two - body repulsion and the one - particle kinetic energy , reflecting and providing a measure of the strength of correlations in the system under study .",
    "for the two - dimensional systems which we discuss here , these values are often larger than the corresponding ones for natural atoms and molecules .",
    "other research opportunities offered by the quantum - dot systems are related to their relatively large ( spatial ) size ( arising from a small electron effective mass and large dielectric constant ) , which allows the full range of orbital magnetic effects to be covered for magnetic fields that are readily attained in the laboratory ( less than 40 t ) . in contrast , for natural atoms and molecules , magnetic fields of sufficient strength ( i.e. , larger than @xmath2 t ) to produce novel phenomena related to orbital magnetism ( beyond the perturbative regime ) are known to occur only in astrophysical environments ( e.g. , on the surface of neutron stars ) @xcite . for ultracold gases",
    ", a similar extraordinary physical regime can be reached via the fast rotation of the harmonic trap .",
    "in addition to the fundamental issues unveiled through investigations of molecular states in quantum dots , these strongly - correlated states are of technological significance because of the potential use of manmade nanoscale systems for the implementation of qubits and quantum logic gates in quantum computers .",
    "the existence of electron and boson molecules is supported by large - scale exact diagonalization ( exd ) calculations , which provide the ultimate theoretical test .",
    "the discovery of these `` crystalline '' states has raised important fundamental aspects , including the nature of quantum phase transitions and the conceptual issues relating to spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in small finite - size systems .",
    "the present report addresses primarily the physics , theoretical description , and fundamental many - body aspects of molecular ( crystalline ) states in small systems . for a comprehensive description of the electronic - shell - structure regime ( aufbau - principle regime ) in quantum dots and of bose - einstein condensates in harmonic traps ,",
    "see the earlier reviews by kouwenhoven @xcite ( qds ) , reimann and manninen @xcite ( qds ) , dalfovo @xcite ( becs ) , and leggett @xcite ( becs ) .",
    "furthermore , in larger quantum dots , the symmetries of the external confinement that lead to shell structure are broken , and such dots exhibit mesoscopic fluctuations and interplay between single - particle quantum chaos @xcite and many - body correlations . for a comprehensive description of this mesoscopic regime in quantum dots ,",
    "see the reviews by beenakker @xcite and alhassid @xcite .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the macroscopic world .",
    "indeed , there is an abundance of macroscopic systems and objects that are observed , or can be experimentally prepared , with effective many - body ground states whose symmetry is lower than the symmetry of the underlying many - body quantum - mechanical hamiltonian ; one says that in such cases the system lowers its energy through spontaneous symmetry breaking , resulting in a state of lower symmetry and higher order .",
    "it is important to stress that macroscopic ssb strongly suppresses quantum fluctuations and thus it can be described appropriately by a set of non - linear mean - field equations for the `` order parameter . ''",
    "the appearance of the order parameter is governed by bifurcations associated with the non - linearity of the mean - field equations and has led to the notion of `` emergent phenomena , '' a notion that helped promote condensed - matter physics as a branch of physics on a par with high - energy particle physics ( in reference to the fundamental nature of the pursuit in these fields ; see the seminal paper by anderson in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    our current understanding of the physics of ssb in the thermodynamic limit ( when the number of particles @xmath3 ) owes a great deal to the work of anderson @xcite , who suggested that the broken - symmetry state can be safely taken as the effective ground state .",
    "in arriving at this conclusion anderson invoked the concept of ( generalized ) rigidity .",
    "as a concrete example , one would expect a crystal to behave like a _ macroscopic _ body , whose hamiltonian is that of a _ heavy rigid rotor _ with a low - energy excitation spectrum @xmath4 of angular - momentum @xmath5 eigenstates , with the moment of inertia @xmath6 being of order @xmath7 ( macroscopically large when @xmath3 ) . the low - energy excitation spectrum of this heavy rigid rotor above the ground - state ( @xmath8 ) is essentially gapless ( i.e. , continuous ) .",
    "thus although the formal ground state posseses continuous rotational symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) , `` there is a manifold of other states , degenerate in the @xmath3 limit , which can be recombined to give a very stable wave packet with essentially the nature '' of the broken - symmetry state ( see p 44 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as a consequence of the `` macroscopic heaviness '' as @xmath3 ,",
    "the relaxation of the system from the wave packet state ( i.e. , the broken - symmetry state ) to the exact symmetrical ground state becomes exceedingly long .",
    "consequently , in this limit , when symmetry breaking occurs , there is practically no need to follow up with a symmetry restoration step ; that is the symmetry - broken state is admissible as an effective ground state .",
    "the present report addresses the much less explored question of symmetry breaking in finite condensed - matter systems with a small number of particles . for small systems , spontaneous symmetry",
    "breaking appears again at the level of mean - field description [ e.g. , the hartree - fock ( hf ) level ] .",
    "a major difference from the @xmath3 limit , however , arises from the fact that quantum fluctuations in small systems _ can not _ be neglected . to account for the large fluctuations",
    ", one has to perform a subsequent post - hartree - fock step that restores the broken symmetries ( and the linearity of the many - body schrdinger equation ) .",
    "subsequent to symmetry restoration , the ground state obeys all the original symmetries of the many - body hamiltonian ; however , effects of the mean - field symmetry breaking do survive in the properties of the ground state of small systems and lead to emergent phenomena associated with formation of novel states of matter and with characteristic behavior in the excitation spectra . in the following , we will present an overview of the current understanding of ssb in small systems focusing on the essential theoretical aspects , as well as on the contributions made by ssb - based approaches to the fast developing fields of two - dimensional semiconductor quantum dots and ultracold atomic gases in harmonic and toroidal traps .",
    "the mean field approach , in the form of the hartree - fock theory and of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , has been a useful tool in elucidating the physics of finite - size fermionic and bosonic systems , respectively .",
    "its applications cover a wide range of systems , from natural atoms , natural molecules , and atomic nuclei , to metallic nanoclusters , and most recently two - dimensional quantum dots and ultracold gases confined in harmonic ( parabolic ) traps .",
    "of particular interest for the present review ( due to spatial - symmetry - breaking aspects ) has been the mean - field description of deformed nuclei @xcite and metal clusters @xcite ( exhibiting ellipsoidal shapes ) . at a first level of description , deformation effects in these latter systems can be investigated via semi - empirical mean - field models , like the particle - rotor model @xcite of bohr and mottelson ( nuclei ) , the anisotropic - harmonic - oscillator model of nilsson ( nuclei @xcite and metal clusters @xcite ) , and the shell - correction method of strutinsky ( nuclei @xcite and metal clusters @xcite ) . at the microscopic level , the mean field for fermions",
    "is often described @xcite via the self - consistent single - determinantal hartree - fock theory . at this level ,",
    "the description of deformation effects mentioned above requires @xcite consideration of unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) wave functions that break explicitly the rotational symmetries of the original many - body hamiltonian , but yield hf slater determinants with lower energy compared to the symmetry - adapted restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) solutions .",
    "in earlier publications @xcite , we have shown that , in the strongly correlated regime , uhf solutions that violate the rotational ( circular ) symmetry arise most naturally in the case of two - dimensional single quantum dots , for both the cases of zero and high magnetic field ; for a uhf calculation in the lowest landau level ( lll ) , see also ref .  @xcite .",
    "unlike the case of atomic nuclei , however , where ( due to the attractive interaction ) symmetry breaking is associated primarily with quadrupole shape deformations ( a type of jahn - teller distortion ) , spontaneous symmetry breaking in 2d quantum dots induces electron localization ( or `` crystallization '' ) associated with formation of _ electron _ , or _",
    "wigner _ , _ molecules _ ) .",
    "the latter name is used in honor of eugene wigner who predicted the formation of a classical _ rigid _ wigner crystal for the 3d electron gas at very low densities @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that because of the finite size , wigner molecules are most often expected to show a physical behavior quite different from the classical wigner crystal .",
    "indeed , for finite @xmath7 , wigner molecules exhibit analogies closer to natural molecules , and the wigner - crystal limit is expected to be reached only for special limiting conditions .    for a small system the violation in the mean - field approximation of the symmetries of the original many - body hamiltonian appears to be paradoxical at a first glance , and some times",
    "it has been described mistakenly as an `` artifact '' ( in particular in the context of density - functional theory @xcite ) .",
    "however , for the specific cases arising in nuclear physics and quantum chemistry , two theoretical developments had already resolved this paradox .",
    "they are : ( 1 ) the theory of restoration of broken symmetries via projection techniques @xcite , and ( 2 ) the group theoretical analysis of symmetry - broken hf orbitals and solutions in chemical reactions , initiated by fukutome and coworkers @xcite who used the symmetry groups associated with the natural 3d molecules . despite the different fields , the general principles established in these earlier theoretical developments in nuclear physics and quantum chemistry have provided a wellspring of assistance in our investigations of symmetry breaking for electrons in quantum dots and bosons in harmonic traps . in particular , the restoration of broken symmetries in qds and ultracold atomic traps via projection techniques constitutes a main theme of the present report .",
    "the theory of restoration of broken symmetries has been developed into a sophisticated computational approach in modern nuclear physics . using the broken - symmetry solutions of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory ( that accounts for nuclear pairing and superfluidity ) ,",
    "this approach has been proven particularly efficient in describing the competition between shape deformation and pairing in nuclei .",
    "for some recent papers in nuclear physics , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ; for an application to superconducting metallic grains , see ref .",
    "pairing effects arise only in the case of attractive interactions and they are not considered in this report , since we deal only with repulsive two - body interactions .      having discussed earlier the general context and historical background from other fields regarding symmetry breaking , we give here an outline of the related methodologies and of the newly discovered strongly correlated phenomena that are discussed in this report in the area of condensed - matter nanosystems .",
    "in particular , a two - step method @xcite of _ symmetry breaking _ at the unrestricted hartree - fock level and of subsequent post - hartree - fock _ restoration of the broken symmetries _ via projection techniques is reviewed for the case of two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor quantum dots and ultracold bosons in rotating traps with a small number ( @xmath7 ) of particles .",
    "the general principles of the two - step method can be traced to nuclear theory ( peierls and yoccoz , see the original ref .",
    "@xcite , but also the recent refs .",
    "@xcite ) and quantum chemistry ( lwdin , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; in the context of condensed - matter nanophysics and the physics of ultracold atomic gases , it constitutes a novel powerful many - body approach that has led to unexpected discoveries in the area of strongly correlated phenomena .",
    "the successes of the method have generated a promising theoretical outlook , bolstered by the unprecedented experimental and technological advances , pertaining particularly to control of system parameters ( most importantly of the strength and variety of two - body interactions ) , that can be achieved in manmade nanostructures .    in conjunction with exact diagonalization calculations @xcite and recent experiments",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the two - step method can describe a wealth of novel strongly correlated phenomena in quantum dots and ultracold atomic traps .",
    "these include :    \\(i ) chemical bonding , dissociation , and entanglement in quantum dot molecules @xcite and in electron molecular dimers formed within a single elliptic qd @xcite , with potential technological applications to solid - state quantum logic gates @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) electron crystallization , with localization on the vertices of concentric polygonal rings , and formation of rotating electron molecules ( rems ) in circular qds . at zero magnetic field",
    "( @xmath9 ) , the rems can approach the limit of a rigid rotor @xcite ; at high @xmath9 , the rems are highly floppy and `` supersolid''-like , that is , they exhibit @xcite a _ non - rigid _ rotational inertia @xcite , with the rings rotating independently of each other @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) at high magnetic fields and under the restriction of the many - body hilbert space to the lowest landau level , the two - step method yields fully analytic many - body wave functions @xcite , which are an alternative to the jastrow / laughlin ( jl ) @xcite and composite - fermion ( cf ) @xcite approaches , offering a new point of view of the fractional quantum hall regime ( fqhe ) @xcite in quantum dots ( with possible implications for the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "large scale exact - diagonalization calculations @xcite support the results of the two - step method outlined in items ii and iii above .",
    "\\(iv ) the two - step method has been used @xcite to discover crystalline phases of strongly repelling ultracold bosons ( impenetrable bosons/ tonks - girardeau regime @xcite ) in 2d harmonic traps . in the case of rotating traps , such repelling bosons form rotating boson molecules ( rbms ) @xcite",
    "that are energetically favorable compared to the gross - pitaevkii solutions , even for weak repulsion and , in particular , in the regime of gp vortex formation .",
    "we will not discuss in this report specific applications of the two - step method to atomic nuclei .",
    "rather , as the title conveys , the report aims at exploring the universal characteristics of quantum correlations arising from symmetry breaking across various fields dealing with small finite systems , such as 2d quantum dots , trapped ultracold atoms , and nuclei  and even natural 3d molecules . such universal characteristics and similarities in related methodologies persist across the aforementioned fields in spite of the differences in the size of the physical systems and in the range , nature , and strength of the two - body interactions . for specific applications to atomic nuclei ,",
    "the interested reader is invited to consult the nucler physics literature cited in this report .",
    "presents a synopsis of the hierarchy of approximations associated with the two - step method , and in particular for the case of 2d quantum dots .",
    "( a similar synopsis can also be written for the case of bosonic systems . )",
    "this method produces approximate wave functions with lower energy at each approximation level ( as indicated by the downward vertical arrow on the left of the figure ) .    at the lowest level of approximation",
    "( corresponding to higher energy with no correlations included ) , one places the restricted hartree - fock , whose main restriction is the double occupancy ( up and down spins ) of each space orbital .",
    "the many - body wave function is a single slater determinant associated with a `` central mean field . ''",
    "the rhf preserves all spin and space symmetries . for 2d quantum dots ,",
    "the single - particle density [ also referred to as electron density ( @xmath10-density ) ] is circularly symmetric .",
    "the next approximation involves the unrestricted hartree - fock , which employs different space orbitals for the two different spin directions .",
    "the uhf preserves the spin projection , but allows the total - spin and space symmetries ( i.e. , rotational symmetries or parity ) to be broken .",
    "the broken symmetry solutions , however , are not devoid of any symmetry ; they exhibit characteristic lower symmetries ( point - group symmetries ) that are explicit in the electron densities .",
    "the uhf many - body wave function is a single slater determinant associated with a `` non - central mean field . ''",
    "subsequent approximations aim at restoring the broken symmetries via projection techniques .",
    "the restoration - of - symmetry step goes beyond the mean field approximation and it provides a many - body wave function @xmath11 that is a linear superposition of slater determinants ( see detailed description in below ) .",
    "the projected ( prj ) many - body wave function @xmath11 preserves all the symmetries of the original many - body hamiltonian ; it has good total spin and angular momentum quantum numbers , and as a result the circular symmetry of the electron densities is restored .",
    "however , the lower ( point - group ) spatial symmetry found at the broken - symmetry uhf level ( corresponding to the first step in this method ) does not disappear .",
    "instead , it becomes _ intrinsic _ or _ hidden _ , and it can be revealed via an inspection of conditional probability distributions ( cpds ) , defined as ( within a proportionality constant ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the projected many - body wave function under consideration .",
    "if one needs to probe the intrinsic spin distribution of the localized electrons , one has to consider spin - resolved two - point correlation functions ( spin - resolved cpds ) , defined as @xmath14 the spin - resolved cpd gives the spatial probability distribution of finding a second electron with spin projection @xmath15 under the condition that a first electron is located ( fixed ) at @xmath16 with spin projection @xmath17 ; @xmath15 and @xmath17 can be either up @xmath18 ) or down ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the meaning of the space - only cpd in is analogous , but without consideration of spin .",
    "further signatures of the intrinsic lower symmetry occur in the excitation spectra of circular quantum dots that exhibit ro - vibrational character related to the intrinsic molecular structure , or in the dissociation of quantum dot molecules .    as the scheme in indicates ,",
    "the mean - field hf equations are non - linear and the symmetry breaking is associated with the appearance of bifurcations in the total hf energies .",
    "the occurrence of such bifurcations can not be predicted _ a priori _ from a mere inspection of the many - body hamiltonian itself ; it is a genuine many - body effect that belongs to the class of so - called emergent phenomena @xcite that may be revealed only through the solutions of the hamiltonian themselves ( if obtainable ) or through experimental signatures .",
    "we note that the step of symmetry restoration recovers also the linear properties of the many - body schrdinger equation .",
    "the relation between quantum correlations and the two - step method ( also called the method of hierarchical approximations ) is portrayed by the downward vertical arrow on the right of . indeed , the correlation energy is defined @xcite as the difference between the restricted hartree - fock and exact ground - state energies , i.e. , @xmath20 as seen from , starting with the broken - symmetry uhf solution , each further approximation captures successively a larger fraction of the correlation energy ; a specific example of this process is given in below ( in ) .",
    "an alternative approach for studying the emergence of crystalline structures is the exact - diagonalizaion method that will be discussed in detail in . like the projected wave functions , the exd many - body wave functions preserve of course all the symmetries of the original hamiltonian . as a result ,",
    "the intrinsic , or hidden , point - group symmetry associated with particle localization and molecule formation is not explicit , but it is revealed through inspection of cpds [ one simply uses the exact - diagonalization wave function @xmath21 in ] and , or recognized via characteristic trends in the calculated excitation spectra . when feasible , the exd results provide a definitive answer in terms of numerical accuracy , and as such they serve as a test to the results obtained through approximation methods ( e.g. , the above two - step method ) . however , the underlying physics of electron or boson molecule formation is less transparent when analyzed with the exact - diagonalization method compared to the two - step approach . indeed ,",
    "many exact - diagonalization studies of 2d quantum dots and trapped bosons in harmonic traps have focused simply on providing high accuracy energetics and they omitted calculation of cpds . however , the importance of using cpds as a tool for probing the many - body wave functions can not be overstated .",
    "for example , while exact - diagonalization calculations for _ bosons _ in the lowest landau level have been reported rather early @xcite , the analysis in these studies did not include calculations of the cpds , and consequently formation of rotating boson molecules and particle `` crystallization '' was not recognized ( for further discussion of these issues , see romanovsky @xcite and baksmaty @xcite ) .    from the above",
    ", it is apparent that both methods , i.e. , the two - step method and the exact - diagonalization one , complement each other , and it is in this spirit that we use them in this report .",
    "historically , the isolation of a small number ( @xmath22 ) of electrons down to a single electron was experimentally realized in the so - called `` vertical '' quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the name vertical qds derives from the fact that the leads and voltage gates are located in a vertical arrangement , on top and below the two - dimensional dot .",
    "at zero magnetic field , experimental measurements @xcite of addition energies , @xmath23 where the chemical potential @xmath24 , indicated that correlation effects at zero and low @xmath9 are rather weak in such dots , a property that later was attributed to the strong screening of the coulomb interaction in these devices . the measured addition energies exhibited maxima at closed electronic shells ( @xmath25 ) and at mid - shells ( @xmath26 ) in agreement with a 2d - harmonic - oscillator central - mean - field model and the hund s rules , and in analogy with the aufbau principle and the physics of natural 3d atoms .",
    "it was found that the measured _ ground - state _ energy spectra for low magnetic fields could be understood on the basis of a simple `` constant - interaction '' model where the effect of the two - body coulomb interaction is reduced phenomenologically to an overall classical capacitance , @xmath27 , characterizing the charging energy @xmath28 of the quantum dot .    as a result of screening",
    ", strong correlation effects and formation of wigner molecules can be expected to occur in vertical dots particularly under the influence of high magnetic fields .",
    "evidence about the formation of wigner molecules in vertical quantum dots has been provided recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where measured ground - state spectra as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 were reanalyzed with exact - diagonalization calculations that included screening . at the time of submission of this report",
    ", a second ground - state crossing at high @xmath9 due to strong correlations was also demonstrated experimentally in a two - electron vertical quantum dot with an external confinement that was smaller than the previously used ones @xcite .",
    "early theoretical work @xcite at zero magnetic field using simply the symmetry broken uhf solutions suggested that an _ unscreened _ coulomb repulsion may result in a violation of hund s rules .",
    "however , following the two - step method of refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown @xcite most recently that the companion step of symmetry restoration recovers the hund s rules in the case of @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath31 results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that both the maxima of the addition energies at closed shells and at mid - shells become gradually weaker ( and they eventually disappear ) as the strength of the coulomb interaction ( and consequently the strength of correlations ) increases , leading to formation of `` strong '' wigner molecules .",
    "the qualitative trend of formation of strong wigner molecules obtained from a relatively simple uhf calculation at @xmath31 has been confirmed later by more accurate exd @xcite and quantum monte carlo @xcite calculations , as well as through symmetry restoration calculations @xcite , although its experimental demonstration remains still a challenge .",
    "a more favorable experimental configuration for the development and observation of strong interelectron correlations is the so - called `` lateral '' dot , where the leads and gates are located on the sides of the dot and thus screening effects are reduced .",
    "tunability of these dots down to a single electron has been achieved only in the last few years @xcite .",
    "most recently , continually improving experimental techniques have allowed precise measurements of excitation spectra of @xmath32 lateral ( and anisotropic ) quantum dots at zero and low magnetic fields @xcite . as discussed in detail in",
    ", the behavior of these excitation spectra @xcite as a function of @xmath9 provides unambiguous signatures for the presence of strong correlations and the formation of wigner molecules .",
    "experimentally observed behavior of two electrons in lateral _",
    "qds @xcite provides further evidence for strong correlation phenomena .",
    "indeed , instead of successively populating delocalized states over both qds according to a molecular - orbital scheme , the two electrons localize on the individual dots according to a heitler - london picture @xcite .",
    "theoretically , such strongly correlated phenomena in double quantum dots were described in refs .",
    "@xcite ; see below .",
    "correlations are expected to influence not only the spectral properties of quantum dots , but also to effect transport characteristics .",
    "indeed correlation effects may underlie the behavior of the transmission amplitudes ( magnitude and phase ) of an electron tunneling through a quantum dot .",
    "such transmission measurements have been performed using aharonov - bohm interferometry @xcite , and an interpretation involving strongly correlated states in the form of wigner molecules has been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "the quantity that links transport experiments with many - body theory of electrons in qds is the overlap between many - body states with @xmath33 and @xmath7 electrons , i.e. , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 annihilates the @xmath36th electron .",
    "the strength of correlations in quantum dots at zero @xmath9 can be quantified by the wigner parameter @xmath0 , which is the ratio between the strength of the coulomb repulsion and the one - electron kinetic energy ( see ) .",
    "naturally , for the case of neutral repelling bosons , the corresponding parameter is the ratio between the strength of the contact interaction and the one - particle kinetic energy in the harmonic trap , and it is denoted as @xmath1 .",
    "larger values of these parameters ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) result in stronger correlation effects .",
    "progress in the ability to experimentally control the above parameters has been particularly impressive in the case of ultracold trapped bosons .",
    "indeed , realizations of continuous tunability of @xmath1 over two orders of magnitude ( from 1 to 5 @xcite and from 5 to 200 @xcite ) has been most recently reported in quasi - linear harmonic traps",
    ". such high values of @xmath1 allowed experimental realization of novel strongly correlated states drastically different from a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "this range of high values of @xmath1 is known as the tonks - girardeau regime and the corresponding states are one - dimensional analogues of molecular structures made out of localized bosons . in two dimenional traps , it has been predicted that such large values of @xmath1 lead to the emergence of crystalline phases @xcite .",
    "the high experimental control of optical lattices has also been exploited for the creation @xcite of novel phases of ultracold bosons analogous to mott insulators ; such phases are related to the formation of electron puddles discussed in and to the fragmentation of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the plan of the report can be visualized through the table of contents .",
    "special attention has been given to the introduction , which offers a general presentation of the subject of symmetry breaking and quantum correlations in confined geometries  including a discussion of the differences with the case of extended systems , a historical background from other fields , and a diagrammatic synopsis of the two - step method of symmetry breaking / symmetry restoration .",
    "the theoretical framework and other technical methodological background are presented in section 2 ( symmetry breaking / symmetry restoration in quantum dots ) , section 3 ( symmetry breaking / symmetry restoration for trapped ultracold bosons ) , and section 4 ( exact - diagonalization approaches ) .",
    "section 4 includes also a commentary on quantum monte carlo methods .    for the case of semiconductor quantum dots ,",
    "the main results and description of the strongly correlated regime are presented in sections 5 , 6 , and 7 , with section 5 focusing on the case of two electrons and its historical significance .",
    "section 8 is devoted to a description of the strongly - correlated regime of trapped repelling bosons .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section 9 , and the appendix offers an outline of the darwin - fock single - particle spectra for a two - dimensional isotropic oscillator under a perpendicular magnetic field or under rotation .",
    "we note that the sections on trapped bosons ( section 3 and section 8) can be read independently from the sections on quantum dots .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian describing @xmath7 electrons confined in a two - dimensional qd and interacting via a coulomb repulsion is written as @xmath37 in , @xmath38 is the dielectric constant of the semiconducting material and @xmath39 .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian in a perpendicular external magnetic field @xmath9 is given by @xmath40 where the external confinement is denoted by @xmath41 , the vector potential @xmath42 is given in the symmetric gauge by @xmath43 and the last term in is the zeeman interaction with @xmath44 being the effective land factor , @xmath45 the bohr magneton , @xmath46 the spin of an individual electron and @xmath47 is the effective electron mass .",
    "the external potential confinement @xmath41 can assume various parametrizations in order to model a single circular or elliptic quantum dot , or a quantum dot molecule .",
    "of course , in the case of an elliptic qd , one has @xmath48 which reduces to the circular qd potential when @xmath49 .",
    "the appropriate parametrization of @xmath41 in the case of a double qd is more complicated . in our work ,",
    "we use a parametrization based on a 2d two - center oscillator with a smooth necking .",
    "this latter parametrization is described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , where readers are directed for further details .",
    "in contrast with other parametrizations based on two displaced inverted gaussians @xcite , the advantage of the two - center oscillator is that the height of the interdot barrier , the distance between the dots , the ellipticity of each dot , and the gate potentials of the two dots ( i.e. , the relative potential wells in the neighboring dots ) can be varied independently of each other .",
    "a prefactor multiplying the coulomb term in ( being either an overall constant @xmath50 as in below , or having an appropriate position - dependent functional form @xcite ) is used to account for the reduction of the coulomb interaction due to the finite thickness of the electron layer and to additional screening ( beyond that produced by the dielectric constant of the material ) arising from the formation of image charges in the gate electrodes @xcite .",
    "vast literature is available concerning mean - field studies of electrons in quantum dots .",
    "such publications are divided mainly into applications of density functional theory @xcite and the use of hartree - fock methods .",
    "the latter include treatments according to the restricted hartree - fock @xcite , unrestricted hartree - fock with spin , but not space , symmetry breaking @xcite , unrestricted hartree - fock with spin and/or space symmetry breaking , and the so - called brueckner hartree - fock @xcite .    from the several hartree - fock variants mentioned above ,",

    "furthermore , based on rather general group - theoretical arguments arising from the observation of hierarchies with lower symmetry in the excited spectra , and motivated by ideas originating in nuclear - physics spectroscopy , it has been discovered in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s that electron correlations in doubly excited he lead to quantization of the spectrum much like in a linear triatomic molecule , @xmath10-he@xmath471-@xmath10 . this molecular picture , with near rigidity and separability , results in `` infinite sequences of vibrational levels , on each of which",

    "qd may be viewed as the culmination of this historical background .",
    "interestingly , as in the aforementioned semiclassical treatments , the collinear configuration plays a special role in the molecule - like model , serving perhaps as `` partial vindication '' of the geometry considered originally by niels bohr .",
    "in the last ten years , and in particular since 1999 ( when it was explicitly demonstrated @xcite that wigner crystallization for small systems is related to symmetry breaking at the _ unrestricted _ hartree - fock mean - field level ) , the number of publications addressing the formation and properties of wigner ( or electron ) molecules in 2d qds and quantum dot molecules has grown steadily .",
    "a consensus has been reached that rotating electron molecules are formed both in zero and high magnetic fields .    at @xmath31 , in spite of considerable differences explored in this report ( see next paragraph ) , formation of rems in quantum dots is driven by the same physical factors as wigner crystallization in infinite 2d media , i.e. , when the strength of the interelectron repulsion relative to the zero - point kinetic energy ( @xmath0 ) exceeds a certain critical value , electrons spontaneously crystallize around sites forming geometric molecular structures . at high magnetic fields ,",
    "the formation of wigner molecules may be thought of as involving a two - step crystallization process : ( i ) the localization of electrons results from the shrinkage of the orbitals due to the increasing strength of the magnetic field ; ( ii ) then , even a weak interelectron coulomb repulsion is able to arrange the localized electrons according to geometric molecular structures ( thus this process is independent of the value of @xmath0 ) .",
    "it has been found @xcite that the molecular structures at high @xmath9 coincide with the equilibrium configurations at @xmath31 of @xmath7 classical point charges @xcite .    due to the small finite number , @xmath7 , of electrons , however , there are two crucial differences between the rem and the bulk wigner crystal .",
    "namely , ( i ) the crystalline structure is that of the equilibrium 2d configuration of @xmath7 classical point charges , and thus consists of nested polygonal rings , in contrast to the well known hexagonal bulk crystal ;    \\(ii ) in analogy with the case of 3d natural molecules , the wigner molecules rotate as a whole ( collective rotations ) ; they behave , however , as highly floppy ( non - rigid ) rotors .",
    "a most striking observation concerning the rems is that their formation and properties have been established with the help of traditional _ ab initio _ many - body methods , i.e. , exact diagonalization , @xcite quantum monte carlo @xcite , and the systematic controlled hierarchy @xcite of approximations involving the uhf and subsequent post - hartree - fock methods .",
    "this contrasts with the case of the jastrow / laughlin @xcite and composite - fermion @xcite wave functions , which were constructed through `` intuition - based guesswork . ''    in spite of its appearance in the middle nineties and its firm foundation in many - body theory , however , the rem picture had not , until recently , successfully competed with the cf / jl picture ; indeed many research papers @xcite and books @xcite describe the physics of quantum dots in high magnetic fields following exclusively notions based on cf / jl functions , as expounded in 1983 ( see ref .",

    "the extensive comparisons in this section lead to the conclusion that the composite - fermion model does not explain the systematic trends exhibited by the magic angular momenta in 2d quantum dots in high magnetic fields .",

    "this picture underlies anderson s aforementioned conclusion that in the thermodynamic limit the broken - symmetry state may be used as the effective ground state .",
    "consequently , in the rest of this section we will focus on issues pertaining to the `` rigidity '' of the rotating electron molecule in high magnetic fields .",

    "an unexpected result of our studies is that the rotation of repelling bosons ( even those interacting weakly ) does not necessarily lead to formation of vortices , as is familiar from the case of rotating bose - einstein condenstates . in particular , for small @xmath7 , we will show that the gross - pitaevskii energies ( including those corresponding to formation of vortices ) remain always higher compared to the ground - state energies of the rbms .",

    "<S> investigations of emergent symmetry breaking phenomena occurring in small finite - size systems are reviewed , with a focus on the strongly correlated regime of electrons in two - dimensional semicoductor quantum dots and trapped ultracold bosonic atoms in harmonic traps . throughout the review we emphasize universal aspects and similarities of symmetry breaking found in these systems , as well as in more traditional fields like nuclear physics and quantum chemistry , which are characterized by very different interparticle forces . </S>",
    "<S> a unified description of strongly correlated phenomena in finite systems of repelling particles ( whether fermions or bosons ) is presented through the development of a two - step method of symmetry breaking at the unrestricted hartree - fock level and of subsequent symmetry restoration via post hartree - fock projection techniques . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative and qualitative aspects of the two - step method are treated and validated by exact diagonalization calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> strongly - correlated phenomena emerging from symmetry breaking include : + </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) chemical bonding , dissociation , and entanglement ( at zero and finite magnetic fields ) in quantum dot molecules and in pinned electron molecular dimers formed within a single anisotropic quantum dot , with potential technological applications to solid - state quantum - computing devices . + ( ii ) electron crystallization , with particle localization on the vertices of concentric polygonal rings , and formation of rotating electron molecules ( rems ) in circular quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> such electron molecules exhibit ro - vibrational excitation spectra , in analogy with natural molecules . </S>",
    "<S> + ( iii ) at high magnetic fields , the rems are described by parameter - free analytic wave functions , which are an alternative to the laughlin and composite - fermion approaches , offering a new point of view of the fractional quantum hall regime in quantum dots ( with possible implications for the thermodynamic limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> + ( iv ) crystalline phases of strongly repelling bosons . in rotating traps and in analogy with the rems , such repelling bosons form rotating boson molecules ( rbms ) . for a small number of bosons , the rbms are energetically favored compared to the gross - pitaevskii solutions describing vortex formation .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the present status concerning experimental signatures of such strongly correlated states , in view of the promising outlook created by the latest experimental improvements that are achieving unprecedented control over the range and strength of interparticle interactions .     </S>",
