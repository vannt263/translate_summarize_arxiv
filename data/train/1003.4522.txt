    "steady progress has been made over the last half - century toward understanding how the heaviest elements in the universe are produced .",
    "for the elements heavier than the iron ( fe ) group , the vast majority of isotopes are produced by the successive addition of neutrons to existing nuclei on timescales that are slow or rapid relative to the average @xmath4 decay rates .",
    "these are referred to as the slow ( @xmath5 ) and rapid ( @xmath2 ) neutron ( @xmath6 ) capture processes , respectively ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for discussion of these processes ) .",
    "the basic physical principles of these reactions are well known .",

    "can be studied in laboratories on earth ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". phenomelogical or nuclear reaction models can then be constructed to predict the general abundance pattern produced by the ( see @xcite ) . when applied to the solar system ( s.  s. ) heavy element abundance distribution ,",
    "the  abundances can be subtracted from the total abundances to reveal the   component ( e.g. , @xcite ) . due to the more energetic nature of the  and the exotic , short - lived nuclei involved , reaction networks for the  were not tractable until only recently ( see @xcite ) . to evaluate and verify detailed nucleosynthesis models ,",
    "abundance patterns must be accurately characterized for as many elements as possible in locations beyond the s.  s.    in this letter , we report abundance estimates for neutral cadmium ( cd  i , @xmath0  48 ) , singly ionized lutetium ( lu  ii , @xmath0  71 ) , and singly ionized osmium ( os  ii , @xmath0  76 ) in the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) spectrum of the  enriched metal - poor star .",
    "this is the first clear detection of cd and lu in a metal - poor star enriched by the .",
    "combined with previous abundance derivations @xcite and several other new abundances derived from the optical spectrum of this star , 32  elements have been detected in , the most complete  pattern in any metal - poor star . in the metal - poor star , which is relatively deficient in the heavy  elements , we also report tentative detections for cd  i and lu  ii , as well as an upper limit for os  ii .",
    "finally , we use these new abundances to differentiate among the various techniques used to predict the  abundance pattern .",
    "nuv spectra of  and were obtained using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "these spectra cover a wavelength region from 22803120  at @xmath8  30,000 .",
    "the optical spectrum of  was obtained using the high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ; @xcite ) on keck  i , and this spectrum covers a wavelength region from 31204640  at @xmath9  45,000 .",
    "see @xcite for further details .    in figure  [ overplot ] ,",
    "we show segments of the stis spectra surrounding the os  ii transition at 2282.28  and the the cd  i transition at 2288.02in  and , as well as .",

    "we have derived abundances of relatively clean , unsaturated , and unblended fe  i and zr  ii lines across the nuv .",
    "we require that these lines have reliable log(@xmath13 ) values ( fe  i : @xcite or a grade of `` c '' or better in the nist database ; zr  ii : @xcite ) , and we derive the abundances by matching synthetic to observed spectra .",
    "ideally we should select metals that make significant contributions to the continuous opacity ( e.g. , mg , as advocated by @xcite ) , but practically we are constrained because there are very few metals whose lines have reliable laboratory transition probabilities and are unsaturated and unblended in the nuv spectra of these stars .",

    "we use these trends as `` local metallicity '' references to empirically adjust the derived abundances of other species ( where neutral species are adjusted according to fe  i and singly - ionized species are adjusted according to zr  ii ) . for example , the abundance derived from the cd  i line at 2615in  is adjusted by @xmath10.32  dex , the difference between a hypothetical fe  i line at 2615  and the mean fe  i abundance for lines in the optical spectral region .",
    "we caution that there are very few fe  i lines and no zr  ii lines shortward of the mg  i series limit at 2515 , where the bound - free opacity contribution from mg  i may increase substantially .",

    "considering all of these sources of uncertainty in the fits and the corrections to account for the continuous opacity , we estimate an uncertainty of at least 0.30  dex for each abundance derivation .",
    "we have rederived the hf  ii abundance in using 4 transitions in the nuv .",
    "several hf  ii transitions can also be detected in the optical spectral range .",
    "finally , we have derived new or revised abundances for several elements between the 1st and 2nd  peaks in  ( nb , mo , ru , rh , pd , and ag ; @xmath0  4142 and 4447 ) using the keck spectrum .",

    "the present uncertainty in our os  ii abundance translates to an age precision of 14  gyr , but if the os  ii uncertainty could be reduced to 0.10  dex the age precision would improve to 4.7  gyr .",
    "the hf  ii abundance derived in  from 4 lines in the nuv is marginally lower ( log  @xmath350.76  @xmath15  0.08 , @xmath36  0.14 ) than that derived from 6 lines in the optical ( log  @xmath350.57  @xmath15  0.03 , @xmath36  0.08 ) .",
    "previous analyses of the hf  ii abundance in  enriched metal - poor stars have revealed that the stellar hf  ii  abundance is higher by 0.150.25  dex than that predicted by the scaled s.  s.  distribution @xcite .",
    "our hf  ii nuv abundance is in excellent agreement with the scaled s.  s.  hf / ree ratio .",

    "our os upper limit in this star is not strong enough to exclude a scaled s.  s.  pattern between the ree and the 3rd  peak .",
    "the detection of these three new species in  is only a first step in understanding how and in what amount these elements were produced . by examining their abundances in other metal - poor stars enriched to different levels by the , we may gain a better sense of any systematic offsets affecting the present analysis .",
