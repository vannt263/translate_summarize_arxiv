    "graphene , due to its outstanding electronic properties @xcite , has been expected to be an excellent candidate for advanced applications in future electronics @xcite . in particular ,",
    "graphene field - effect transistors ( fets ) take advantage of high carrier mobility @xcite and high critical current density @xcite , which makes them suitable for operating in high - frequency ranges @xcite",
    ". intrinsic cut - off frequency of a few hundreds of ghz @xcite and a record maximum oscillation frequency of 70 ghz @xcite in graphene devices have been reported recently . however ,",
    "for practical applications , graphene transistors still have serious drawbacks associated with the lack of energy bandgap and a poor saturation of current @xcite .",
    "the former makes it difficult to turn off the current , leading to a small on / off current ratio typically lower than ten @xcite .",
    "the latter results in a small voltage gain and hence in the power loss when the devices are integrated in a circuit .",
    "so far , many efforts of bandgap engineering in graphene @xcite have been made to overcome these limitations .",
    "a common technique consists in cutting 2d graphene sheets into 1d narrow nanoribons @xcite . to open a bandgap in 2d graphene sheets ,",
    "some prominent options are bernal - stacking of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride substrate @xcite , nitrogen - doped graphene @xcite , graphene nanomesh lattice @xcite and bernal - stacking bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "however , each technique has its own issues .",
    "for instance , graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) devices require a narrow width with a good control of edge disorder @xcite .",
    "graphene nanomesh lattices have the same requirement about the good control of the lattice of nanoholes and the disorder @xcite , while the bandgap opening in bilayer graphene may not be large enough to achieve a sufficiently high on / off ratio in transistors for digital applications @xcite .",
    "other proposed methods still need experimental verification and realization .     and * * a**@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 are the lengths of unit cell ( four atoms per cell ) along the ox and oy directions , respectively . on the right",
    "are the brillouin zones showing the change in dirac points ( * k * and * k * ) with uniaxial strains applied along the ox - axis ( transport direction).,width=288 ]    in addition to being attractive to electronics , graphene also shows remarkable mechanical properties .",
    "it has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite that graphene is amenable to a large strain of over 20@xmath4 .",
    "actually , strain engineering offers a wide range of opportunities for modulating electronic properties of graphene nanostructures .",
    "in particular , the bandgap in armchair gnrs has a linear strain - dependence under weak strain , whereas it presents periodic oscillations at large strain @xcite . for a zigzag gnr",
    ", strain can change the spin polarization at the ribbon edges , and therefore modulate its bandgap . in a 2d monolayer graphene ,",
    "a finite gap can open under very large shear strain @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the bandgap may remain close to zero but the dirac points are displaced @xcite .",
    "many interesting electrical , optical , and magnetic properties induced by strain have been also reported , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the effects of uniaxial strain applied in a 2d monolayer graphene sheet and explore the possibility to use a strained / unstrained hetero - channel ( see fig .",
    "1 ) to achieve good operation of graphene fets .",
    "actually , local strain has been realized in experiments @xcite and theoretically demonstrated to improve the electrical performance of various graphene devices @xcite .",
    "for instance , the local strain has been shown to enhance the on current in a gnr tunneling fet by a factor of ten @xcite and to fortify the transport gap in strained gnr junctions @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate here that the use of strained heterostructure with a moderately small strain of @xmath5 can greatly improve the performance of graphene fets with a view to high on / off ratio and good saturation of current in normal transistors ; low subthreshold swing and strong non - linear effects in tunneling devices .",
    "our model is based on a nearest - neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the application of a uniaxial strain along the ox ( transport ) direction causes the following changes in the @xmath6 bond vectors @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the strain and @xmath9 is the poisson ratio @xcite . the hopping parameters between atoms _",
    "i _ and _ j _ are defined as @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is their bond length while the hopping energy @xmath12 @xmath13 and the bond length @xmath14 @xmath15 in the unstrained case . therefore , there are two different hoping parameters @xmath16 along the armchair and zigzag directions , respectively , in the strained graphene ( see in fig .",
    "this tight - binding hamiltonian is solved in the ballistic limit using the green s function technique , self - consistently with the poisson s equation ( for more details , see ref .",
    "after the self - consistency is reached , the current is computed from the landauer equation as @xmath17 } } \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the source ( drain ) fermi distribution function , @xmath19 is the transmission coefficient and the integral over the wave - vector @xmath20 is performed in the first brillouin zone .    in our simulated devices schematized in fig .",
    "1 , the gate of length 80 nm covers symmetrically both sides of the hetero - channel with a transition zone of @xmath21 9 @xmath15 between unstrained and strained sections . we assume the doping concentration @xmath22 = 10@xmath23 @xmath24 in the source and drain access regions and the gate stack made of high-@xmath25 insulator @xcite .",
    "we consider in this work two typical devices : normal fet ( nfet ) where the source and drain access regions are both @xmath26-doped and tunneling fet ( tfet ) where the drain is @xmath27-doped .",
    ") as a function of energy and evolution of the conduction gap in strained graphene heterostructures .",
    "the comparison of the conductance in unstrained , uniformly strained and strained heterostructures is shown in ( a ) .",
    "the conduction gap as a function of strain in the heterostructures is displayed in ( b ) while the inset shows the bottom of conduction bands versus wave vector @xmath20.,width=316 ]    first , let us analyze the basic transport properties of strained / unstrained graphene heterostructures . solving the tight binding hamiltonian for strained graphene , we obtain the energy bands : @xmath28 where @xmath29 with the length @xmath30 of unit cell as indicated in fig .",
    "1 . hence , the bandgap of uniformly strained graphene remains zero at @xmath31 and @xmath32 but the dirac points are displaced under the effect of strain , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "1 . this does not change the zero conduction - gap characteristic of graphene channel ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) when we consider the conductance as a function of energy .",
    "however , in strained / unstrained heterostructures , we notice a very interesting phenomenon : the appearance of a finite conduction gap and this gap increases monotonically when increasing the strain ( see fig .",
    "this phenomenon is explained as follows . for a given @xmath20-mode",
    ", graphene has an energy gap defined as @xmath33 . because of the shift of dirac points induced by strain as further illustrated by the plot of the conduction - band bottom versus @xmath20 in the inset of fig .",
    "2(b ) , there is always a finite energy gap @xmath34 of transmission in the strained heterostructure .",
    "the value of this gap is the maximum of @xmath35 in the strained and unstrained graphene sections .",
    "therefore , a finite gap of conductance occurs ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) and is determined by the minimum value of @xmath34 when varying @xmath20 in the whole brillouin zone : @xmath36 .",
    "this conduction gap is of course strain - dependent .",
    "for instance , it reaches about 360 @xmath37 for @xmath38 @xmath4 and can have a higher value for larger strains ( see fig .",
    "similar properties of strained gnr junctions have also been discussed in ref .",
    "this interesting feature is the key point suggesting that the performance of graphene fets can be improved using a strained / unstrained hetero - channel .",
    "characteristics of simulated graphene fets at @xmath39 @xmath40 with different strains ( a ) and for @xmath38 @xmath4 with different @xmath41 ( b).,width=326 ]        it has been shown @xcite that there are three components that contribute to the current in graphene nfets : thermionic transmision in the energy regime higher than the gate - induced potential barrier , chiral tunneling through the barrier , and band - to - band tunneling taking place between the valence band in the source and the conduction band in the drain . while the band - to - band tunneling has an important contribution at high @xmath41 which leads to a poor current saturation , the contribution of two other components results in a high off current ( low on / off current ratio ) in gapless graphene devices .",
    "the use of a gapped graphene channel is hence necessary to solve these issues .",
    "we first focus on the possibility of using a strained / unstrained graphene channel to improve the performance of graphene nfets .",
    "we find as displayed in fig .",
    "3(a ) that when increasing the strain ( or conduction gap ) , the off current is strongly reduced and , by defining arbitrarily the on current as the current obtained at @xmath42 @xmath40 , the on / off current ratio significantly increases to over @xmath43 for @xmath38 @xmath4 .",
    "such a high ratio seems to be at variance with what was shown for bilayer graphene @xcite and graphene nanomesh fets @xcite where an energy gap of @xmath44 @xmath37 is not enough to switch off the current efficiently , i.e. , to obtain a large on / off ratio .",
    "this may be because in these devices , the energy gap occurs locally in the gated region , and therefore is not sufficient to suppress the thermionic and/or band - to - band tunneling components .",
    "the situation here is different and can be explained as follows .",
    "in fact , the transport modes @xmath20 that contribute significantly to the current are the values @xmath20 in / around the range from @xmath45 to @xmath46 ( see in the inset of fig .",
    "2(b ) ) . far from this range to the left and to the right , the energy gap @xmath47 in the strained ( source and half of the gated zone ) and unstrained ( drain and half of the gated zone ) graphene sections , respectively , is too large , which suppresses very strongly the corresponding current component even in the on state .",
    "close to @xmath48 or @xmath46 , the energy gap mentioned is still large but the corresponding current component starts to have a significant contribution to the on current while it remains almost negligible in the off state .",
    "for other modes @xmath20 , e.g. , around @xmath49 , the energy gap of @xmath50 , though smaller than the gap of modes discussed above , occurs along the whole channel and is thus enough to switch off the corresponding component of current in the off state as illustrated by the pictures of local density of states and transmission coefficient in fig . 4 for @xmath51 @xmath40 .",
    "the combined effect of these @xmath20-dependent energy gaps ( discussed further below ) makes the on / off current ratio very large .",
    "next , we investigate the operation of graphene tfets using the same strained hetero - channel .",
    "the conventional tfets , besides being able to offer a high on / off current ratio , have an additional advantage of having steep subthreshold swings lower than the thermally - limited value of 60 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this good performance , in principle , can not be achieved with a gapless channel as in unstrained graphene devices . using the strained hetero - channel",
    ", we find as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) that an on / off current ratio higher than @xmath43 is also achieved while the subthreshold swing can reach a value smaller than 30 @xmath52c .",
    "all the results obtained demonstrate that strained hetero - channels are excellent candidates for graphene devices in digital applications .",
    "we now go to explore the influence of @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we display @xmath53 curves obtained in graphene nfets for different @xmath41 .",
    "interestingly , it is shown that a very high on / off current ratio can still be achieved for high @xmath41 up to about 0.3 @xmath40 . beyond this value of @xmath41",
    ", the off current increases more rapidly and the on / off ratio is hence reduced , but it still reaches a value of @xmath54 at @xmath55 @xmath40 .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the pictures of local density of states and transmission coefficient in fig .",
    "4 . again , for @xmath20 around @xmath49 , the energy gaps in the source , gated , and drain regions are merged together at @xmath41 lower than @xmath56 @xmath40 , which forms a large enough conduction gap to suppress strongly the corresponding current component . for @xmath20 around @xmath46 ( similarly , for @xmath20 around @xmath45 ) , the energy gaps in the gated and drain regions are also merged together , and thus efficiently suppress the current .",
    "this explains a small off current obtained for @xmath41 lower than @xmath56 @xmath40 .",
    "the situation suddenly changes at high @xmath41 when the band - to - band tunneling comes into play .",
    "indeed , as seen in fig . 4 for @xmath55 @xmath40 , the energy gap in the drain is separated from the others and the band - to - band tunneling has an important contribution to the current .",
    "this results in the rapid increase of the off current with @xmath41 shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) .",
    "characteristics of simulated graphene nfets with different @xmath57 : unstrained graphene channel ( @xmath58 @xmath4 ) and strained graphene heterostructure ( @xmath38 @xmath4 ) . note that the current at @xmath59 @xmath40 is multiplied by 500.,width=326 ]    in the negative range of @xmath57 , when the channel is @xmath27-doped , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a pseudo - saturation of current or even a negative differential conductance ( ndc ) can be observed and was explained by the reduction of chiral tunneling when increasing @xmath41 together with the limited contribution of thermionic / band - to - band currents .",
    "similar effects are also observed in our simulated devices in the range of @xmath57 from @xmath60 @xmath40 to @xmath61 @xmath40 .",
    "because of the strong effect of energy gaps mentioned , a strong ndc behavior with a peak - to - valley ratio of @xmath62 is even observed , as shown in the @xmath63 curve presented in fig . 5 for @xmath64 @xmath40 . the saturation behavior is also achieved in the @xmath26-branch ( very positive @xmath57 ) , where the thermionic current is dominant ( see the further discussions below ) . additionally , it is remarkable to notice that in this regime , though reduced compared to the unstrained graphene fets , the transconductance @xmath65 of the strained hetero - channel devices is still high .",
    "in particular , the transconductance has the value of @xmath21 4.3 @xmath66 for @xmath67 @xmath40 , while it is about 13.9 @xmath66 in the unstrained case .",
    "characteristics of simulated graphene tfets ( @xmath38 @xmath4 ) for @xmath57 ranging from 0.1 @xmath40 to 0.35 @xmath40 .",
    "the inset shows the current with strong rectification at @xmath68 @xmath40.,width=326 ]    combined with the high transconductance , the good saturation of current in the positive @xmath57-range would be expected to result in a high value of voltage gain @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the output conductance . in fig . 5",
    ", we display the current as a function of drain voltage in the @xmath57-range from @xmath71 @xmath40 to 0.35 @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , the saturation behavior of current is significantly improved when using strained hetero - channels , compared to the unstrained graphene fets . as a consequence of the reduced output conductance ,",
    "the voltage gain at @xmath72 @xmath40 reaches the values of @xmath21 9.5 and 18 for @xmath73 @xmath40 and 0.3 @xmath40 , respectively , while it is only @xmath21 2.8 and 4.7 in the unstrained device . to further evaluate the operation of the device in the high - frequency range",
    ", we estimate the cutoff frequency @xmath74 and the maximum oscillation frequency @xmath75 using the standard expressions @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath78 @xcite . @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the total gate and gate - to - drain capacitances while @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the source and gate resistances , respectively .",
    "we take the values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath81 is typically @xmath21 100 @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath82 reasonably reaches a value of 200 @xmath83 @xmath84 . for @xmath67 @xmath40",
    ", we obtain @xmath85 ghz while @xmath86 ghz is even slightly larger than @xmath74 .",
    "similar behaviors have also been reported in some experiments @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values obtained in the unstrained case are @xmath87 ghz and @xmath88 ghz .",
    "thus , though reduced in the strained hetero - channel device , the transconductance and transition frequencies are still high . together with the good current saturation and hence high voltage gain , our results demonstrate that the strained hetero - channel devices are also very promising for high - frequency applications .    finally , we additionally found that the graphene tfets can exhibit very strong non - linear effects on the @xmath63 characteristics .",
    "in particular , two specific features , namely , gate controllable negative differential conductance and strong rectification of current , are observed , as shown in fig .",
    "6 . actually , the gate controllable ndc behavior in tfets based on a gapped graphene channel has been discussed and explained in ref .",
    "@xcite by assuming the possibility of controlling the gap profile in the gated zone . here ,",
    "our simulations show that the strong ndc behaviour can be achieved in the on state with a peak - to - valley ratio of a few tens ( e.g. , 47 for @xmath89 @xmath40 ) . moreover , because of the strong effects of energy gaps , a finite gap of current occurs in / around the off state .",
    "this leads to high on / off current ratio in a finite range of @xmath41 , similar to that in the graphene nfets discussed above , with the possibility of tuning strongly the non - linearity of the @xmath63 curves using the gate voltage .",
    "it also results in a strong effect of current rectification around @xmath90 , as clearly seen in the inset of fig .",
    "6 . these non - linear effects can offer great potential for applications such as oscillator , frequency multiplier , fast switching @xcite , in non - boolean logic circuits recently proposed @xcite , and in rectifier circuits .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the strain effects on the transport properties of unstrained / strained graphene heterostructures and considered the possibility of using such heterostructures to improve the performance of graphene transistors .",
    "it was shown that due to the deformation of electronic bandstructure , the mismatch between transport modes having different effective energy gaps in strained / unstrained sections results in a finite conduction gap in these graphene hetero - channels .",
    "we have demonstrated that this type of hetero - channels can improve very significantly the performance of graphene fets for both digital and high - frequency applications . in particular , an on / off current ratio higher than @xmath43 can be achieved . in graphene nfets , while transconductance and transition frequencies are still high , the performance are additionally improved with respect to conventional graphene fets in terms of current saturation and hence voltage gain . in graphene tfets , low subthreshold swing and strong non - linear effects such as gate controllable ndc behavior and current rectification",
    "are observed .",
    "this type of strain - induced conduction - gap engineering could certainly be useful for improving performance of other devices based on graphene / graphene - like materials and for other applications .    * _ acknowledgment .",

    "<S> by means of numerical simulation , we study in this work the effects of uniaxial strain on transport properties of strained graphene heterojunctions and explore the possibility to achieve good performance of graphene transistors using these hetero - channels . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a finite conduction - gap can open in the strain junctions due to the strain - induced deformation of graphene bandstructure . </S>",
    "<S> these hetero - channels are then demonstrated to improve significantly the operation of graphene field - effect - transistors ( fets ) . in particular , on / off current ratio can reach a value of over 10@xmath0 . in graphene </S>",
    "<S> normal fets , transconductance , though reduced compared to the case of unstrained devices , is still high while good saturation of current can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this results in high voltage gain and high transition frequency of a few hundreds of ghz for a gate length of 80 nm . in graphene </S>",
    "<S> tunneling fets , subthreshold swing lower than 30 @xmath1 , strong non - linear effects such as gate controllable negative differential conductance , and current rectification are observed . </S>"
