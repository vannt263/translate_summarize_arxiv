    "a function of the spectral parameter known as hill s discriminant is the basic quantity containing important information both about the spectrum of the differential operator and also about the construction of the ( quasi)periodic solutions .",
    "this paper focuses on a representation of the hill discriminant which is given in the form of a power series in the spectral parameter .",
    "this representation is obtained by using recent results of kravchenko @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that since the hill discriminant for each value of the spectral parameter can be obtained from a couple of corresponding linearly independent solutions , any available representation for these solutions leads to a representation of hill s discriminant . nevertheless , in general",
    "no easy and practically treatable representation for hill s discriminant is known unless for the case of some well - studied equations such as the mathieu and the lam equations .",
    "long ago , jagerman @xcite introduced and studied in detail the so - called cardinal series representation of hill s discriminant . in the famous book of magnus and winkler @xcite the hill discriminant for schroedinger type equations",

    "the spectral parameter enters in a quite sophisticated way with all the terms being functions of the spectral parameter .",
    "instead , our result herein gives the hill discriminant in the form of a power series in the spectral parameter with the series coefficients independent of it and calculated only once , i.e. , for a single value of the spectral parameter .",
    "moreover , its practical implementation is easy and as an illustration we show in the present work the numerical results obtained for the mathieu equation .",
    "we also show that the spps representation gives additional information not only concerning the original equation but also on its darboux - related partners . as a corollary",
