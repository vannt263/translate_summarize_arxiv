    "the calar alto observatory is located at 2168 m height above the sea level , in the sierra de los filabres ( almeria - spain ) at  45 km from the mediterranean sea .",
    "it is the second largest european astronomical site in the northern hemisphere just behind the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( located in the island of la palma ) , and the most important in the continental europe ( with excellent communications , making logistics easy , unexpensive and reliable ) .",

    "the observatory is under operations since 1975 , when its 1.23 m zeiss reflector saw first light .",
    "the observatory operates a very large array of optical and near - infrared astronomical instrumentation , including imagers and spectrographs with different field - of - view and resolutions",
    ".    there has been different attempts to characterize some of the main astronomical properties during its 35 years of operations : ( i ) leinert et al .",
    "( 1995 ) determined the sky brightness corresponding to the year 1990 ; ( ii ) hopp & fernandez ( 2002 ) studied the extinction curve corresponding to the years 1986 - 2000 ; ( iii ) ziad et al .",

    "the optical spectrum at the calar alto observatory shows a strong contamination produced by different chemicals , in particular from mercury lines , which contribution to the sky - brightness in the different bands is of the order of  0.09 mag ,  0.16 mag and  0.10 mag in b , v and r respectively . regarding the strength of the sodium pollution line in comparison with the air - glow emission ,",
    "it is very strong , a problem which we expect to address in the near future in collaboration with the regioanl governament and the nearby towns . in any case",

    "caha is classified as a class c site `` major observatory sites with operating telescopes having apertures @xmath02.5 m and zenith light pollution levels less than the natural variation in night - sky brightness associated with the 11-year solar cycle '' ] .",
    "a light - pollution regulation was been recently approved by the andalusian regional government , and the observatory is involved in its development , in order to reduce and revert the effect of human light pollution .",
    "the effect of such laws have been strong in other astronomical sites , as it was demonstrated for the kitt - peak observatory .",

    "these values are similar to those at other astronomical sites , including paranal , la silla , la palma and mauna kea .",
    "only the last one is clearly darker in the near - ir bands than any of the others .",
    "the typical extinction in the observatory in the v - band is  0.15 mag in the winter season , with little dispersion . in summer",
    "the extinction has a wider range of values , due to an increase of the aerosol extinction ( dust grains ) , although it does not reach the extreme peaks observed at other sites ( figure 1a ) .",
    "in particular , the extinction in the summer season is much lower than those reported for the observatories in the canary islands ( benn & ellison 1998 ) , where the influence of the sahara desert in that archipelago makes the extinction to rise above 0.25 mag in the v - band for a 20% of the time in this season .",
    "the presence of ozone is negligible at the calar alto observatory .",
    "the derived extinction curve shows that the typical extinction in the u - band is  0.4 - 0.5 mag , a remarkable good value for observatories at this height .",
    "the distribution of seeing was derived using the information gathered by the seeing monitor installed in the observatory for more than 4 years ( 300.000 individual measurements ) , and the science data from the alhambra ( moles et al .",
    "2008 ) survey , from @xmath15000 individual frames . in both cases",
    "it was obtained that the median seeing was about  0.9 \" , with a sub - arcsecond seeing in @xmath170% of the time ( figure 1b ) .",
    "the historical record in the observatory shows the maximum registered wind speed was 47 m / s in the last 28 years .",

    "as can be seen , there is no sudden variations .",
    "this fact makes the observatory a excellent site for large infrastructures .",
