    "such entangled states include the symmetric entangled coherent states ( secss ) @xmath4 @xcite and the n00n states @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "both of them have found important applications in quantum metrology ; see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a secs of light fields can be transformed to a photonic schrdinger cat state @xmath6 @xcite simply by a beam - splitter ( bs ) operation .",
    "cat states of matter wave and even light field have been experimentally demonstrated @xcite , but a photonic one with the sufficiently large size @xmath7 is still beyond the reach .    since the seminal work of yurke and stoler @xcite ,",
    "the application of kerr nonlinearity has been suggested as the direct way to entangle light fields or construct photonic cat states @xcite .",
    "realizing strong coupling between photons via the suitable nonlinear media is , however , a rather difficult task .",
    "this barrier stimulates the parallel researches on creating the approximate states by squeezing ( see , e.g. @xcite and the reference of @xcite ) and exploring the proper use of weak kerr nonlinearity ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a less noticed problem with kerr nonlinearity and squeezing is the availability of their single - mode versions , which are the basis for all relevant schemes thus far .",
    "a realistic photonic pulse carries multiple modes represented by the field operator @xmath8 ( in one - dimensional space for illustration ) .",
    "for instance , under the action of a multi - mode self - kerr hamiltonian @xmath9 of the unit coupling constant or its equivalent form @xmath10 in the wave - vector space , the output states can be significantly different from the proper ones that should have evolved under the sum of single - mode actions @xmath11 , even if the inputs are exactly single - mode ones .",
    "this effect of mode entanglement or mode mixing has been detailedly studied in @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the effect is a vanishing or a very limited clean cross phase ( similar to that obtained from the single - mode cross - kerr model ) under highly demanding conditions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a multi - mode squeezing action @xmath12 of one field as well deviates from its single - mode version .",
    "in contrast , the multi - mode bs hamiltonian @xmath13 for two fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 takes the form @xmath16 , a sum of the individual mode actions .",
    "this bs coupling enables a multi - mode photonic state to be transformed ideally like a single - mode one , because the decomposable evolution operator @xmath17 with respect to the wave - vector modes @xmath18 acts independently on each mode .    in this paper",
    "we provide a method for generating arbitrary symmetric entangled states out of light fields based only on such _",
    "clean _ bs coupling . unlike a common linear optical setup ,",
    "the bs coupling we need acts conditionally on the part of a superposition of quantum states at the same spatial location . below",
    "we will show how to produce a symmetric entangled state with a conditional bs coupling and will give an example of the realization of the given type of interaction in a proper quantum system .",
    "from now on , we use the term _ mode _ in the meaning of a single wave - vector or a single frequency mode , since we will consider bs type coupling only .",
    "the two arbitrary states @xmath19 , @xmath20 we will entangle are treated as the single - frequency ones .    to entangle the two states , we also need an ancilla quantum system with two stable states @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ". this system can be an atom , as well as an ion , a quantum dot or a superconducting qubit .",
    "the ancilla system is initially in the state @xmath21 , setting the initial state for the total system as @xmath23 .",
    "then we perform a @xmath24  rotation between the @xmath21 and @xmath25 and transfer the system to the superposition@xmath26 such @xmath24 rotation can be realized by applying a resonant @xmath27 pulse to the transition @xmath28 .",
    "[ ptb ]    timeseq.eps    the above superposition of @xmath21 and @xmath25 works as a logic control on the swapping between two input photonic modes : the swapping between the photon modes is activated in the @xmath22 subspace and does not happen in the @xmath29 subspace .",
    "such conditional swapping can be realized by the bs transformation@xmath30{c}\\hat{a}_{1}(t)\\\\ \\hat{a}_{2}(t ) \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}\\cos\\chi_{0}t & -ie^{i\\phi}\\sin\\chi_{0}t\\\\ -ie^{-i\\phi}\\sin\\chi_{0}t & \\cos\\chi_{0}t \\end{array } \\right )   \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}\\hat{a}_{1}(0)\\\\ \\hat{a}_{2}(0 ) \\end{array } \\right )   \\label{idealbmheis}\\ ] ] for the time @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the annihilation operator for the @xmath33-th mode and @xmath34 is the effective bs coupling constant .",
    "the bs transformation can be implemented via the dispersive parametric three - wave mixing ( twm ) @xcite or four - wave mixing ( fwm ) @xcite process . the use of the dispersive type of the interaction allows to avoid the decoherence of the generated state due to incoherent scattering as during the bs interaction the ancilla system is always preserved in its ground state and only the photon states are changed .",
    "the conditional swapping results in the state @xmath35    then , again we perform a @xmath24  rotation between @xmath29 and @xmath22 to have them transformed as @xmath36 , leading to the following state@xmath37 finally , by measuring @xmath21  and @xmath25 ( see the method in the following example ) , we make the photonic sector of the total state collapse to the target symmetric entangled states @xmath38 . for clarity the complete procedure of the above",
    "is summarized in fig . 1 .    a candidate for the ancilla system should satisfy two requirements .",
    "first , the quantum system should have two long - lived and well separated states between which a @xmath24  rotation can be performed .",
    "the second requirement is specified by the swapping stage ",
    "the system should have an appropriate energy level structure for the formation of the twm or fwm interaction loop where two of the transitions have to be strongly coupled to the input fields .",
    "these conditions can be satisfied by certain trapped natural atoms or ions , single color centers , quantum dots or superconducting qubits based on the josephson junctions , which have multi - level structures and can also be strongly coupled to the suitable field modes .",
    "different from the idea of inducing the conditional interaction of matter wave ( ion or atom ) state superposition with one optical mode @xcite for creating the cat states @xcite , our setup allows to realize a conditional coupling directly between two photonic modes for their swapping .",
    "this is necessary for constructing a secs @xmath39 with @xmath40 ( for making a cat state of large size ) or a n00n state .",
    "our method aims to generate all such states in a unified way .",
    "here we provide an example to implement the protocol with the single ion of calcium @xmath41 trapped in ion trap and embedded in optical resonator as the ancilla system .",
    "the energy level structure of the calcium ion @xmath41  is illustrated in fig .",
    "trapped ions are well studied systems for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the construction of multi - partite entangled states of trapped ions themselves has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "our proposed setup for entangling cavity fields via a trapped ion is similar to that of the recent experiments reported in @xcite .",

    "these particular levels are chosen as the ground states for two reasons .",
    "first , both of the states are long - lived ( up to the order of @xmath44 s ) .",
    "second , due to the selection rule and large energy difference between them , one of the ground states is excluded from our parametric fwm loop to swap two photonic modes so that the conditional bs coupling can be realized .",
    "the photonic modes we will swap are prepared as the steady - state fields of the cavity .",
    "the process building up the steady cavity field can be described by the hamiltonian ( @xmath45 ) @xmath46 in the interaction picture with respect to the cavity hamiltonian @xmath47 .",
    "the first term in the above describes the continuous wave ( cw ) drives of the frequency @xmath48 , and with the intensity @xmath49 and the detuning @xmath50 from the cavity frequency @xmath51 .",
    "the second term about the coupling between the cavity modes and the cavity noise operator @xmath52 gives rise to the damping of the cavity at the rate @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the steady cavity fields in the coherent state with @xmath54 will be created by driving the cavity for a while .",
    "the cavity fields in fock state can be established by the technique in @xcite .",
    "the two prepared intra - cavity modes in the state @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the different polarization will be coupled to the transition @xmath57 at @xmath58 nm of the trapped ion .    in case",
    "when the intra - cavity modes are in the coherent states the secss will be generated and for the fock and vacuum inputs the n00n states will be obtained as the result of the conditional swapping . as follows from the interaction configuration presented in fig.2(b ) only the ground state @xmath22 ( @xmath43 ) becomes coupled to the optical modes but there is no coupling to the optical modes for the state @xmath21 ( @xmath59 ) . in order to perform a @xmath24 rotation between @xmath29 and @xmath22 and bring the ion into the superposition state in eq .",
    "( [ state1 ] ) , a resonant @xmath27 laser pulse at @xmath60 nm with  @xmath61 - polarization is applied to the quadrupole transition @xmath62 . during the swapping stage",
    "there are also two classical pumping pulses with the orthogonal circular polarizations applied to the transitions @xmath63 at @xmath64 nm , while the cavity modes @xmath65  and @xmath66 are coupled to the transitions @xmath67 in the parametric fwm loop .",
    "to realize the parametric bs coupling , all real transitions in the loop should be suppressed and ideally the ion should stay in its ground state during the swapping process .",
    "therefore all fields should be highly detuned from the resonance and satisfy certain conditions ( see the discussion below ) . by controlling the duration of the classical pulses we can control the precise parametric interaction time for obtaining the state in ( [ state2 ] ) .",
    "after another @xmath27 laser pulse at @xmath60 nm with  @xmath61 - polarization there will be the state in ( [ state3 ] ) .",
