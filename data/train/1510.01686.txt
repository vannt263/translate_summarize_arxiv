    "significantly more calculational effort would be required to apply the lp factorization formula to inclusive higgs production in association with a @xmath413 pair at nlo .",
    "the advantage over the complete nlo calculation is that the theoretical errors could be further decreased by using the evolution equations for the fragmentation functions to sum the leading logarithms of @xmath4 .",
    "the lp factorization formula can also be applied to inclusive higgs production without @xmath413 .",
    "the most important couplings of higgs @xmath0 below the @xmath413 threshold are its couplings to gluons in the effective field theory ( heft ) obtained by integrating out top quark loops . in the lp factorization formula at lo ,",

    "<S> we present a factorization formula for the inclusive production of the higgs boson at large transverse momentum @xmath0 that includes all terms with the leading power of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section is factorized into convolutions of parton distributions , infrared - safe hard - scattering cross sections for producing a parton , and fragmentation functions that give the distribution of the longitudinal momentum fraction of the higgs relative to the fragmenting parton . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared - safe cross sections and the fragmentation functions are perturbatively calculable . </S>",
    "<S> the most important fragmentation functions are those for which the fragmenting parton is the top quark , gluon , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the higgs itself . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the fragmentation functions at leading order in the standard model coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> the factorization formula enables the resummation of large logarithms of @xmath4 due to final - state radiation by integrating evolution equations for the fragmentation functions . by comparing the cross section for the process @xmath5 from the leading - power factorization formula at leading order in the coupling constants with the complete leading - order cross section </S>",
