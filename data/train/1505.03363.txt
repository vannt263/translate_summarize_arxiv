    "let us compare the polarizability of a quantum emitter ( called quantum polarizability hereafter ) with the bulk polarizability of a dielectric nanosphere . in general terms , the time - averaged dipole force describing the interaction of a monochromatic field @xmath8 of frequency @xmath9 with a particle of polarizability @xmath2",
    "is given by  @xcite : ( ) = e_0 ( ) , where @xmath10 ( here @xmath11 denotes time average ) .",

    "the polarizability of the quantum emitters varies linearly with the intensity of the incident field for small intensities ( @xmath43 ) leading to a constant ratio @xmath41 . for larger intensity",
    ", this ratio decreases due to saturation effects from the quantum emitters .",
    "the incident intensity also has an impact through the dependence of the emitters with the internal temperature of the nd  @xcite ( see appendix  [ param_siv ] ) . in the context of levitation , this effect is important as the nd can reach high temperatures even with low intensities , see . in order to account for this effect , the internal energy of the nd is obtained as a function of the absorption rate of the incident laser photons , @xmath44 , the absorption rate of the black body radiation of the environment , @xmath45 , and the black body emission rate , @xmath46 , is given by  @xcite [ eq : rate_balance ]    m c_m t_i = _ l +   ,    where @xmath47 is the internal temperature of the nd , @xmath48 its mass , and @xmath49 its specific heat .",

    "see app .",
    "[ param_siv ] , the total quantum polarizability for a nd containing a large density of centers clearly overcomes the bulk polarizability for low intensities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the internal temperature will be largely modified by the non - radiative properties of the embedded quantum emitters which we have not accounted for here . in particular , the main contribution will be from the limited quantum efficiency of siv centres and , to a lesser extend , from its emission in the phonon sidebands .",
    "in addition , it is important to note that the experimental values used to estimate the emissivity of the diamond ( see appendix  [ param_diamond ] ) are limited to the 2.5 - 6.5@xmath54 m range leading to an underestimated black body emission rate .",
    "the internal temperature of the nano - diamond could be further reduced by coating its surface with a small layer of glass  @xcite providing much higher emissivity in the infra - red . by achieving much lower internal temperatures ,",
    "the optical properties of the siv centers will significantly improve .",
    "in the following we assume that the quantum polarizability dominates @xmath55 and discuss in a general way how this can be used to levitate a dielectric nanosphere in evanescent fields . in analogy to bichromatic atomic optical traps",
    "@xcite , we consider an evanescent field in vacuum of the form : [ eq : bichrom ] ( , t ) = e_1 ( ) _ 1 e^-_1 t + e_2 ( ) _ 2 e^-_2 t+ + the exponentially decaying electric field amplitudes are given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the field decay rate and @xmath58 the field amplitude at the dielectric surface .",

    "we are interested in the interaction of such field with a two - level quantum emitter when far - detuning or weak driving for the two modes is not assumed .",
    "this is an unusual scenario for most of the atomic trapping experiments with evanescent fields  @xcite ; notwithstanding , this was studied before both experimentally and theoretically , see for instance  @xcite and reference therein .",
    "one can analytically calculate the time - averaged dipole force considering that the beating is much faster than the dynamics of the mechanical motion .",
    "this is done solving a recursive equation obtained with a floquet analysis . as shown below , one encounters that the total dipole force is not simply the sum of the forces that each mode would exert in the absence of the other mode but a more involved expression containing mixing terms that reflect the intricate interplay between the red and blue driving fields .",
    "in particular , for a bichromatic field ( ) , the hamiltonian of the system in the rotating frame defined by the unitary @xmath66 reads = - _ eg ( , t ) e^_1 t - . here",

    "provides repulsive optical forces to prevent the nanosphere from adsorbing to the surface producing the near - fields .",
    "consequently it is necessary to account for the casimir - polder force to fully capture the trapping potential . in order to simplify the calculation ,",

    "this approach , inspired from the far - off - resonance trapping ( fort ) for cold - atoms  @xcite , relies on the use of a far detuned near - field trap to reduce the excited state population @xmath72 . in this case , one constrain remains : the force from the quantum emitters should remain larger than the bulk one in order to provide blue - detuned repulsive fields .",
    "another consequence of this configuration is the important reduction of the overall forces . to compensate for this , we propose to use an additional blue - detuned field from the microsphere cavity .",
    "such field plays the role of the red - detuned field from the nano - cavity in preventing the nd from falling on the cavity under the casimir - polder forces . by using a far - of - resonance blue - detuned field , one can achieve a much stronger field gradient , further improving the trapping efficiency . despite the added complexity of using trapping fields from both the nano - fiber and the cavity , this configuration allows for maintaining the resolved sideband regime while significantly reducing the population of the excited state by using a large detuning .",

    "in this article we have shown that the polarizability given by a set of quantum emitters embedded in a nanosphere can overcome its bulk polarizability .",

    "we have then discussed how this can be used for levitated quantum optomechanics using an evanescent coupling of the center of mass of the nanosphere with a microcavity mode .",
    "due to a large polarizability to mass ratio , large cavity field mode gradient , and a smaller cavity mode volume , one could achieve the strong single photon cooperativity in the resolved sideband regime .",
    "a case study has be done considering a nanodiamond with a high density of embedded siv color centers at room temperature .",

    "<S> we theoretically show that the dipole force of an ensemble of quantum emitters embedded in a dielectric nanosphere can be exploited to achieve near - field optical levitation . </S>",
    "<S> the key ingredient is that the polarizability from the ensemble of embedded quantum emitters can be larger than the bulk polarizability of the sphere , thereby enabling the use of repulsive optical potentials and consequently the levitation using optical near - fields . in levitated cavity quantum optomechanics , </S>",
    "<S> this could be used to boost the single - photon coupling by combining larger polarizability to mass ratio , larger field gradients , and smaller cavity volumes while remaining in the resolved sideband regime and at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a case study is done with a nanodiamond containing a high - density of silicon - vacancy color centers that is optically levitated in the evanescent field of a tappered nano - fiber and coupled to a high - finesse microsphere cavity . </S>"
