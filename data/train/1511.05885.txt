    "recent rigorous observations have provided an unprecedented accuracy that has to be taken into account in any cosmological modeling @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nowadays , we have enough discriminating data to investigate the practicability of a proposed inflationary scenario precisely @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that the recent planck data favors the simplest inflationary models consisting of a single field slow - roll @xcite .",
    "although some inflationary models always remain in the valid domain @xcite , many of them have been excluded due to incorrect predictions particularly in the density perturbation spectral index on the cmb as well as the power of primordial gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "this decisive information is at our disposal now , thanks to several experiments and decades of rehearsing on the issue .",
    "simultaneously , we are witnessing some remarkable experiments in particle physics and quantum field theory .",
    "no one can doubt that cosmology and quantum field theory are tightly bound and any achievement in one of them must be considered as a clue for the other .",
    "there are many attempts to find a qft motivation as a decisive sign of an acceptable inflationary scenario @xcite-@xcite and conversely , the capability of a qft paradigm to include the inflation , is supposed as a supportive sign for the paradigm @xcite . on the other hand , after endorsement of the higgs boson existence , the last predicted particle of the standard model @xcite , there are more attention on the inflationary capability of symmetry breaking scenario @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the measured higgs mass in the lhc also raised another problem : the higgs mass and the top quark mass together increase the chance of being in a metastable vacuum for the electroweak theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "topologically , a discrete vacuum means domain wall production if the symmetry breaking is * perfect * @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we have known after zeldovich s 1975 paper @xcite that domain walls are drastically in contradiction with the observed cosmic mean energy density unless the domain wall energy density is low enough .",
    "such low energy scales never provide appropriate outline for a successful inflation although the cmb residual dipole anisotropy might be explained using them @xcite .",
    "the domain wall problem also appears when one tries to solve the strong cp problem by means of introducing a new axion field @xcite .",
    "indeed , to explain invisibility of axions due to their weak coupling to matter one could hypothesize more quark spices than the usual standard model quarks , or assume two higgs doublets .",
    "the latter case is more appealing in quantum field theory since it offers the modest possible extension to the standard model .",
    "moreover , there are yet unconfirmed reports of observing the footprint of higgs - like particles in atlas and cms @xcite , which put the multi - higgs theories under the spotlight . assuming a two doublet higgs scenario , one inevitably encounters even number of domain walls separated by strings .",
    "the number of appearing domain walls are two times the number of the generators .",
    "if the energy scale of domain walls is high enough such that domain wall production precedes the inflation , then one has an explanation for not observing such walls , like what happens in magnetic monopoles .",
    "domain walls also could leave no significant remnant in the later stages if they disappear soon enough .",
    "there are some known mechanisms for destructing a domain wall which could operate alone or in combination with each other @xcite .",
    "the most famous one is assuming a metastable domain wall which automatically tends to ruin it @xcite .",
    "of course , the decay time could be very long , for example the decay time of electroweak metastable vacuum , in the case of existence , is of the order of the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "potentially , unstable domain walls are also among the best candidates for justification of baryogenesis . amid",
    "the other options one can mention destabilizing a domain wall by another defect collision or embarking the symmetron mechanism @xcite .",
    "there is a very interesting idea that mini black holes could trigger the electroweak vacuum decay in a similar way . on the other hand",
    ", one can generalize the natural inflation to include a dynamical modulus in addition to the proposed angular field dynamics .",
    "this generalization , respectively , promotes for example @xmath3 to the double fields potential in which the @xmath0 symmetry is broken to @xmath4 discrete symmetry @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "it worth to have an exhaustive analysis of the potential with explicit @xmath5 broken symmetry , to know both the inflationary behavior and possible domain wall properties .",
    "here , we try a double field potential @xcite with two discrete vacua as a toy model of domain wall formation and inflation , trying to avoid rendering numerical results before having an analytical picture . by this",
    ", we always keep the track of the model parameters employing appropriate approximations .",
    "the assumed potential is very close to the original higgs potential @xcite except that the continuous @xmath0 symmetry now is broken into a @xmath1 symmetry with two discrete vacuua to produce domain walls @xcite . to get more familiar with the domain wall properties which potentially could be produced by the proposed model , we first calculate its energy scale for a simple spacial configuration .",
    "results show that entering more parameters into the model and making it more sophisticated provides us with more freedom to control the wall energy scale without decreasing the energy scale of the potential at the origin significantly , in contrast to the zeldovich s proposal @xcite .",
    "next , we discuss the most important possible scenarios in which the potential could accomplish inflation , starting with a complete analytic review of the simple symmetry breaking case according to the recent data .",
    "we stick to the most prevailing method of diagnostic in which the slow - roll parameters play the basic role in the analysis @xcite .",
    "we also overcome the difficulties of dealing with a double field inflation @xcite-@xcite by treating the potential as an equivalent single field potential .",
    "it soon becomes clear that almost all the scenarios are compatible with the famous hill - top new inflationary models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "such models of course are categorized among the super - planckian models with no attainable motivation from known physics , but like other new inflationary models some particular characteristics make them noticeable : they predict very small primordial gravitational waves @xcite,@xcite-@xcite , much less than what one may hope for detection in a conceivable future . the other point about hill - top models is that there are some techniques to arrange them to work in the supergravity scope @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we have a comprehensive review on the previous studies which provide motivations for our survey on descending the @xmath0 symmetry to the @xmath1 .",
    "we focus on fundamental theories skipping applied physics and condensed matter .",
    "it is interesting that these different theories are related due to a common characteristic of producing @xmath1 domain walls from an original @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "then in the third section , we analyze the domain wall characteristics of the proposed potential , where we find a very close approximation as a solution for the domain walls .",
    "this approximate solution satisfies the pde s and static virial theorem simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we invoke this approximation to deal with the other important domain wall characteristics , including the surface energy density and the wall thickness . afterwards , in the forth section , we propose the potential as the source of inflation , starting from a novel analysis on the ordinary @xmath0 symmetry breaking inflation .",
    "we try to have a complete survey on all possible scenarios of a successful inflation .",
    "we conclude that the saddle point inflation could reduce the scale of the required energy for inflation . this reduction being not such effective to avoid the theory from becoming a super - planckian .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusion which contains the most important results of the paper .",
    "although @xmath1 symmetry could not assumed as a formal part of the standard model of particles , it appears frequently for certain reasons .",
    "one of these arenas is extending the higgs sector .",
    "in fact , in spite of unnecessity of extra bosons in the standard model , many pioneering theories like supersymmetry and grand unified theories , demand for extending the higgs sector .",
    "the simplest and the most well - known extended models demand for two higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) .",
    "2hdms also provide one of the best explanations for axion invisibility @xcite .",
    "axions are nambo - goldstone bosons of pecci - quinn @xmath0 spontaneous symmetry breaking which originally was invented to solve the strong cp conservation problem @xcite .",
    "theoretically , spontaneous breaking of the @xmath3 leaves domain wall(s ) attaching to a string , @xcite . assuming a multi - higgs model to deal with the recent unconfirmed record of observing a higgs - like bump in lhc s last run @xcite , reinforces the existence of such extensions of the standard model higgs sector .",
    "if the higgs cousins contain interaction with standard model fermions , which is a very natural postulate , then one can assume @xmath1 symmetry and the appropriate fermionic eigen value to avoid higgs - mediated flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xcite .",
    "recently , a survey has proposed the cosmological consequences of explicit breaking of @xmath3 @xcite , considering the potential to be @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a complex field defined as @xmath8 . in their analysis ,",
    "the responsible term for breaking the @xmath0 symmetry demonstrates only the phase field dependence . in our survey",
    "we let the explicit symmetry breaking term to have modulus dependence , too . we therefore assume @xmath9 also for simplicity",
    ", we focus on @xmath10 case since it suffices to inspect the topological domain wall behavior . we are thus led to @xmath11 it is worth mentioning that the above potential form is also a conformally renormalizable extension of natural inflation @xcite .",
    "natural inflation , was originally , based on the dynamics of the phase of a complex field whose modulus is stabilized severely .",
    "then the numbo - goldstone boson becomes massive thanks to the instanton effect . in the qcd case ,",
    "instantons break the @xmath0 symmetry down to a discrete subgroup to produce the axion - inflaton potential @xmath12 the key prediction of the above form of inflation is the strong gravitational wave remnant .",
    "in fact , strong enough to be detected in the recent planck project .",
    "lacking such approval from observation , one could suppose more completion to the original natural model .",
    "bestowing modulus dependence on the potential is supposed to be one of the first choices .",
    "this choice has also been considered recently in @xcite by introducing @xmath13 the above potential coincides with ksvz @xcite modification of pecci - quinn theory , in which @xmath2 . in order to promote the above potential to contain two domain walls , which is more desirable in our study",
    ", we suggest @xmath14 then assuming @xmath15 , one obtains @xmath16 which is just ( [ ver1 ] ) , with a renaming of the parameters . as it will be introduced later in the paper , our choice of variables for dealing with ( [ ver1 ] ) or ( [ ver2 ] ) is @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 from a completely different point of view , in the inflationary paradigm of cosmology , there is a category of potentials , dubbed new inflation , in which the slow roll starts from nearly flat maximum of the potential where the field(s ) is(are ) located near the origin . in other words , the slow roll happens to be outward from the origin .",
    "these category of inflationary models , survived the tests though they generally suffer super - planckian parameters . among new inflationary theories one could mention inverted hybrid inflation @xcite , which was an attempt to merge new inflation with the hybrid inflation .",
    "the potential has the following form @xmath20 now if one redefines the parameters as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 then ( [ inverted ] ) reduces to @xmath25 which is just the cartesian form of ( [ ver3 ] ) .",
    "of course in order to restore the tachyonic instability of the field @xmath26 , an additional constraint @xmath27 is needed , but in our study the latter condition wo nt be necessary .",
    "in this sectin , we present a brief motivation for explicit @xmath0 symmetry breaking from susy . to avoid lengthening the article , we avoid any introductory entrance to supersymmetry .",
    "the reader may consult many comprehensive textbooks on the subject .",
    "supersymmetry , if exists at all , must be a broken symmetry .",
    "many attempts have been made to introduce a viable explicit or spontaneous mechanism to explain the supersymmetry breaking .",
    "here , we consider a d - term ssb by adding an additional @xmath0 gauge symmetry ( fayet - iliopoulos mechanism ) @xcite and derive the resultant potential .",
    "we will see that the resulting potential , for the case of two charged scalar fields , demonstrates an explicitly broken @xmath0 behavior , when is exhibited in norm - space of the fields .",
    "moreover , since lhc has been obtained no approval evidence for minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , considering additional fields to the supersymmetry sounds as a next logical step .",
    "one of the elegant properties of supersymmetry is the automatic appearance of a scalar potential through f and d auxiliary fields which are originally invented to balance the off - shell bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom @xcite : @xmath28 supersymmetry requires the vacuume expectation value ( vev ) to vanish . in this",
    "regard , non - vanishing ( positive ) vev is considered as a sign for ssb . in other words , if both d - term and f - term super potential contributions ca nt be zero coincidently , then the supersymmetry is broken .",
    "one way to do this task is assuming an extra @xmath0 symmetry and let the potential to involve a linear d - term besides the ordinary terms : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the fields that acquire charge under new @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the first term , known as fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term , satisfies both supersymmetry and @xmath0 gauge symmetry . then supposing the charged scalar field to be massive , one obtains @xmath31 obviously , the above potential has a non - zero minimum which demonstrates breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "one has to note that despite broken supersymmetry , the @xmath0 gauge remains unbroken if @xmath32 for all fields .",
    "if @xmath30 for all @xmath33 s happen to be massive , then they must appear in pairs with apposite charges to respect the gauge symmetry .",
    "of course , there is no obligation for charged scalar fields to be massive since they can be considered massless without losing any bosonic degrees of freedom . in order to get closer to the model considered in this paper , we consider two massive charged scalar fields @xmath34 and @xmath26 and recast @xmath35 and @xmath36 while the charges are normalized to @xmath37 .",
    "we obtain @xmath38 let us redefine the potential in polar coordinates by setting @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then we have @xmath41 taking derivative with respect to angular coordinate yields @xmath42\\ ] ] then two groups of solutions will be gained for @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the former is always available but the latter needs an elaborated fine tuning of parameters , particularly , when the @xmath46 field is located near the origin initially , like what happens in a normal new inflationary scenario .",
    "therefore , one can consider four attractor paths down from the origin as the slow - roll path , which are equal pairwise . @xmath47",
    "^ 2+m_\\psi ^2 ( \\phi_0 ^2-\\frac{m_\\psi ^2}{\\lambda}),\\ ] ] @xmath48 ^ 2+m_\\phi ^2 ( \\phi_0 ^2-\\frac{m_\\phi ^2}{\\lambda}).\\ ] ] to protect the @xmath0 gauge symmetry for each field one requires @xmath49 , where @xmath33 stands for the corresponding field .",
    "one has to note that the potential exhibits the ssb due to its positive definition , whether the gauge symmetry has been broken or not . in the case of @xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking , the potential develops one - dimensional kinks , different in shape for each scalar . if both scalar fields are involved in the gauge symmetry breaking , then four vacua will develop . for @xmath50 ,",
    "all vacua are degenerate and stable , while for @xmath51 , the two vacua which are related to the more massive field @xmath52 , become metastable and ultimately decay to the two stable vacua @xmath53 . since the decay rate decreases exponentially by decreasing the difference of vev s , it is possible to consider the situations in which the metastable lifetime exceeds the age of the universe . here",
    ", some more elaboration is in order .",
    "if ( [ dssb ] ) is assumed for supersymmetric masses set to zero then one obtains @xmath54 which means that in the space of the charged scalar field norms , the potential shows a @xmath0 symmetry , explicitly broken by an effective mass of one of the fields .",
    "to begin , we propose the simplest asymmetric scenario in a two - fields potential in which we require that @xmath55 satisfies the following constraint : @xmath56 for @xmath57 , we know that @xmath58 is a solution of ( [ simplest ] ) for any arbitrary function @xmath59 .",
    "this ensures @xmath0 symmetry if we choose @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and consequently @xmath62 breaks this symmetry .",
    "the above equation has the general solution of the form @xmath63 or @xmath64 where we consider positive definition for @xmath65 throughout the paper . to achieve a more familiar potential form",
    "let us recast the fields into @xmath60 and @xmath61 and also let the function @xmath66 to have an ordinary symmetry breaking appearance .",
    "then the potential ( [ wwe ] ) could be written as @xmath67 the potential ( [ original ] ) shows a full circular symmetry in the first parenthesis resembling the higgs potential @xcite . in the inflationary context",
    "this is a self consistent version of a particular hill - top model @xcite .",
    "in fact , without the last term in ( [ original ] ) , the circular freedom in the vacuum corresponds to the massless goldstone boson @xcite but for the case under consideration , the vacuum is not a continuous minimum and as we will see , the circular field acquires mass as well as its own roll down mechanism which has to be considered in slow roll assumption and could bring about different consequences . from now on , we will discuss the symmetry breaking term with the plus sign in ( [ original ] ) , but a brief argument about this choice is in order .",
    "suppose we choose the plus sign in ( [ original ] ) , then by the following redefinition @xmath68 and interchanging the variables @xmath69 , one obtains @xmath70 where @xmath71 so the plus or minus choice for epsilon coefficient is trivial up to a constant .",
    "although breaking the @xmath0 symmetry down to @xmath1 is very common in condense matter and superconductivity @xcite , it has received less attention in fundamental theories . in order to have a better perspective about the potential ,",
    "let us change the field coordinates into polar coordinates by setting @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the potential then becomes @xmath74 now we are able to discuss the behavior of the potential by taking a differentiation with respect to the radial field .",
    "@xmath75 to learn about the extrema , let us find the roots of @xmath76 ; @xmath77 obviously , there could be up to three roots . here",
    "we are able to categorize the potential as bellow @xmath78 @xmath79 { \\rm 1 \\ ; or\\ ; 3 \\ ; roots\\ ; } { \\rm \\quad saddle\\ ; point\\ ; at\\ ; the\\ ; origin}\\label{ue2}\\ ] ]     ( left ) and @xmath80 ( right ) .",
    "the origin appears as local maximum for @xmath81 and is a saddle point for the other case .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left ) and @xmath80 ( right ) . the origin appears as local maximum for @xmath81 and is a saddle point for the other case .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the stronger the inequality ( [ ue2 ] ) , the wider range of @xmath82 recognizes the origin as minimum . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the two saddle points are located at @xmath83 on the @xmath26 axis .",
    "as the inequality @xmath84 becomes weaker the saddle points move toward the origin where finally meet the origin for @xmath85 .",
    "the origin remains a saddle point for @xmath86 ( figure [ fig : lmsp ] ) .",
    "since the potential exhibits discrete vacua after symmetry breaking , domain wall production seems inevitable . more technically , it is the vacuum manifold @xmath87 that determines the character of possible topological defects @xcite and in our case the zero homotopy group , or zero homotopy set as mathematicians prefer , is not trivial @xmath88 which warns us about the inevitability of domain walls generation through the kibble mechanism @xcite .",
    "one expects at least one domain wall per horizon volume if the symmetry breaking is * perfect*. the potential ( [ original ] ) has recently been analyzed due to the capability of generating domain walls with a rich dynamics @xcite .",
    "there is a tight constraint on the existence of domain walls except for very low surface energy densities @xcite .",
    "let us see why this is so .",
    "for the very popular toy model of @xmath1 discrete symmetry breaking in which the effective potential has the @xmath89 well - known form ; @xmath90 where @xmath34 is a real field , the scenario has been already analyzed in many references @xcite so it would be adequate to review only the results . for simplicity , we assume a minkowskian background space - time since it suffices to indicate the major properties . after the symmetry breaking is settled down , as a very simple simulation , one could suppose a planar domain wall placed on the @xmath91 plane at @xmath92 .",
    "for planar domain walls , everything is independent of @xmath93 and @xmath94 coordinates and as long as we are interested in the static situation , the time dependency is eliminated .",
    "so we get @xmath95 the first integral of this equation is @xmath96 where the constant of integration @xmath97 vanishes when we impose the boundary conditions of vanishing of the potential and the spacial field derivative at the infinity .",
    "then the domain wall solution for the assumed boundary condition is @xmath98 or @xmath99 and for the surface energy density of the domain wall we obtain @xmath100 the thickness of the wall is defined as @xmath101 . in an expanding universe ,",
    "any proper velocity of the walls very soon becomes negligible , which leaves the universe with a non - relativistic network of domain walls , and here the problem arises ; according to the kibble mechanism , domain walls are generally horizon - sized so we can estimate their mass as if we do for a horizon - sized plate i.e. @xmath102 , so the mass energy density can roughly be approximated as @xmath103 .",
    "we know that the critical density evolves as @xmath104",
    ". therefore @xmath105 . by setting @xmath106 at about the gut scale ,",
    "the domain wall energy density reaches the critical density already in the time of wall generation and one expects that in our time this ratio becomes @xmath107 which shows a catastrophic conflict with reality .",
    "in order to compromise between the introduced domain walls and the observations , one needs to decrease the energy of the possible domain walls to very small values @xcite . as we will derive in ( [ sedw ] ) for the more sophisticated domain walls other parameters involve to determine the wall energy which gives us sort of freedom to prepare the potential to work as inflation .",
    "the other remedy is to allow the disappearance of domain walls so early that not only diminish from the density calculations but also not altering the cmb isotropy , considerably .",
    "this can be achieved in various ways .",
    "for example , one can imagine the potential as an effective potential to demote the wall to an unstable version , by which , one of the vacua will disappear through the biased tunneling effect , or considering some sort of destructing collisions which are generally fatal for a kink stability and for such primordial walls the primordial black holes might be the best candidates @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that domain walls even at very low energies could cause a residual dipole anisotropy in large scale observations , and such an anisotropy is receiving increasing observational supports @xcite .",
    "static double - field domain wall solutions corresponding to ( [ original ] ) satisfy the following two coupled euler - lagrange equations @xmath108 @xmath109 these equations can be merged into @xmath110 to find the solution of the above equation with appropriate boundary conditions , we have a guide line ; @xmath111 must be odd with respect to @xmath112 coordinate due to its main role in the discrete symmetry breaking process , while for @xmath113 both sides of the wall in @xmath92 has the same characteristics since both vacua lay at @xmath114 .",
    "in other words , @xmath26 has to be even with respect to the z coordinate .",
    "moreover ( [ merged ] ) is subject to the following boundary conditions @xmath115",
    "@xmath116 @xmath117 the trajectory of transition between the vacua does nt pass through @xmath118 if @xmath119 , since the origin in this case is a local maximum of the potential . to find the domain wall solution ,",
    "first , we employ an appropriate ansatz for one field and derive the other field .",
    "then we will check the accuracy of the final solution by comparing it with the numerical solutions .",
    "our estimation about the final form must fulfill the boundary conditions .",
    "the best choice would be @xmath120 , this hyperbolic form which has been inspired by the @xmath89 kink solution , fully satisfies the boundary conditions and indicates the odd characteristic of @xmath111 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath121 is also reasonable since after two times differentiation it will produce the desired @xmath65 factor while the @xmath106 coefficient cancels out by division .",
    "next , we put this ansatz solution into ( [ merged ] ) , which after some straightforward calculation one obtains for @xmath113 ; @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are constants of integration . but the above solution has been separated into an odd term and an even term .",
    "so to keep the evenness property of @xmath113 we require @xmath125 . to fix the solution we have to find the remaining constant @xmath124 . this can be done by means of the minimum energy theorem and integration , but we utilize the static virial theorem , since both of these two theorems stem from the least action principle , they could be used interchangeably .",
    "the static virial theorem has another important consequence of vanishing the tangential pressure for the wall , which we prove before inserting it into our calculation . for a typical multi - field potential",
    "the euler - lagrange equations have the general form @xmath126 where @xmath127 enumerates the fields . for a static solution and a planar wall",
    "these can be written as @xmath128 here @xmath129 is chosen to be the coordinate perpendicular to the wall .",
    "multiplying by @xmath130 one obtains @xmath131=\\frac{d}{dz}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{d\\chi_a}{dz}\\right)^2-v(\\chi_a)\\right]=0,\\ ] ] @xmath132 if we require a true vacuum to have zero energy expectation value then the constant of integration in the above equation should be zero .",
    "note that the derived static one dimensional version of virial theorem must be valid for the proposed guess if we require it to satisfy the euler - lagrange equation of motion .",
    "obtaining another relation among the fields first derivative and the potential , one can use it in order to determine @xmath123 in ( [ mge ] ) by requiring @xmath133 substituting for @xmath111 , @xmath113 and @xmath134 and after some algebraic simplification one finds @xmath135 which results in @xmath136 @xmath137 this solution approximates very closely the more accurate numerical solution ( figure [ fig : domainwall ] ) and the wall width is @xmath138 . as the next step one can calculate the energy - momentum of the wall @xmath139diag(1,1,1,0)=\\frac{\\epsilon\\phi_0 ^2}{\\cosh^2{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}z}}\\left(1-\\frac{2\\epsilon}{\\lambda\\sigma^2}\\tanh^2{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}z}\\right),\\ ] ]     and @xmath113 have been plotted for @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , although the parameters ave been selected very close to the boundary of the approximation validity ( @xmath143 ) still the analytical solutions are very close to numerical solutions .",
    "the insets are zoomed to demonstrate the tiny difference .",
    "]    note that although our domain wall solution ( [ pdw],[sdw ] ) was approximate , the vanishing of @xmath144 is an exact result @xcite .",
    "if we use this result to find the surface - energy density we find @xmath145 this result seems interesting since now one can control the effect of @xmath106 by @xmath65 and ultimately for the case of @xmath146 one obtains @xmath147 , which is independent of @xmath148 .",
    "this result is noticeable because in contrary to the @xmath89 kink case , now it is possible to decrease the wall energy without decreasing the maximum of the potential , in other words , the peak could be chosen , say at the gut or even planck scale , since the wall energy density is low enough to avoid domain wall density domination . to be more clear parameter",
    "@xmath148 controls the height of the potential through @xmath149 while @xmath65 is responsible for the wall energy density .",
    "the above approximate solution , circumspectly , could be generalized to the below potentail @xmath150 where @xmath151 is an arbitrary real number . in order to adapt our postulate to the well - analyzed @xmath4 groups ,",
    "we require @xmath151 to be integer or half integer .",
    "since other choices of @xmath151 are related to our line through a field redefinition , the above assumption does nt demote the level of the generality .",
    "then one has to note that ( [ gen ] ) shows explicit breaking of @xmath0 symmetry into the @xmath152 where @xmath153 restores ( [ polar ] ) . by this , one obtains @xmath154 domain walls , which are equal up to the free lagrangian . but the picture becomes more contrived if one assumes interactions of @xmath155 and @xmath156 independently , since they acquire different values for each vacuum .",
    "now , let us practice the ( [ pdw],[sdw ] ) approximation for the new case .",
    "suppose we have a potential with @xmath157 which provides @xmath158 domain walls .",
    "first we recast the fields into their cartesian form by @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "then for the @xmath161 domain wall , the boundary conditions read @xmath115 @xmath162 and @xmath163 where each line demonstrate two distinct possibilities for each sign .",
    "obviously , the odd and even properties of the fields , which are crucial for the next steps , disappear . in order to restore the parity characteristics in boundary behavior one needs to rotate the fields by angel @xmath164 , where @xmath165 counts the number of the intended walls when we enumerate them counter clockwise from @xmath166 and @xmath167 is the angular period of the potential .",
    "@xmath168 then , for even @xmath158 , the potential remains the same since the rotation angel is an integer times the period .",

    "we can rewrite the potential as @xmath176 in which we have used @xmath177 obviously , this potential is now in the domain of `` new inflation '' , in which the field rolls away from an unstable equilibrium , here placed at the origin . even after considering the whole potential",

    "to be more precautious and to have a measure for the coming procedure , let us see the case more closely .",
    "the slow roll parameters @xcite are @xmath184 and @xmath185 to estimate the field value at the end of inflation we require @xmath186 @xcite , then the appropriate solution would be @xmath187 assuming @xmath188 and utilizing the taylor expansion in favor of the leading terms we can write ( [ rend1 ] ) as @xmath189 one can recognize that the end of inflation happens close to the true minimum . having an estimate for @xmath190",

    "one can readily justify that @xmath198 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath197 .",
    "it implies that lowering the @xmath197 raises the field value in which the desired scale leaves the horizon .",
    "this statement is reasonable since smaller @xmath197 leads to a decrease in the slope of the potential with respect to the field @xmath46 .",
    "this provides us a straightforward method to find the maximum allowed value for @xmath197 in which @xmath198 coincides with the origin i.e. @xmath199 , then the answer will be @xmath200 therefore from ( [ apr ] ) , if one requires @xmath201 , it roughly means @xmath202 . which is in accord with the previous assumption about smallness of @xmath197 . to have an insight",
    ", we have to emphasize that this upper bound for @xmath197 coincides with ignorable @xmath198 and undetectably low value for primordial gravitational waves as it will become clear shortly .",
    "now let us have a look at the most important observational constraints on any inflationary hypothesis ; spectral index and tensor to scalar perturbation ratio . for the spectral index",

    "recall that we keep assuming @xmath192 .",
    "let us use the fact that tensor to scalar perturbation ratio `` @xmath205 '' ; @xmath206 must be smaller than @xmath207 @xcite . combining the definition of `` @xmath205 '' with ( [ srp1 ] ) and making some simplification yields @xmath208 which points to a vanishingly small @xmath205 when the horizon exit happens near the origin @xmath209 as mentioned before .",
    "substituting for @xmath198 we obtain @xmath210 where @xmath211 is defined as @xmath212.\\ ] ] then for the spectral index we have @xmath213 this estimation is not precise enough yet but helps us to have a better insight . assuming a lower value for @xmath197 means that @xmath198 moves away from the origin but this can not effect the gravitational wave strength considerably , since ( [ ret ] ) can always be approximated as @xmath214 from ( [ bign ] ) one can verify that @xmath215 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath197 in the allowed range @xmath216 ( figure [ fig : spectral ] ) .     with versus @xmath197 for the range of e - folding ( @xmath217 and @xmath218 ) . therefore one can claim that for the model under investigation , spectral index is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath197 . ]    but we have an accurate observation for the scalar spectral index by planck tt+lowp @xmath219 cl , @xcite ; @xmath220 this yields the range of valid @xmath197 for a typical e - folding @xmath221 @xmath222",
    "this means @xmath223 which exhibits a relatively stringent fine tuned need of the model . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimated lower limit for @xmath197 can help us to determine the maximum of @xmath224 since from ( [ tit ] ) we have @xmath225 which is again a decreasing function of @xmath197 in the permitted region @xmath226 such that @xmath224 remains between @xmath227 and @xmath228 , approximately .",
    "one can estimate the tensor to scalar ratio using ( [ rca ] ) in ( [ ttosa ] ) to obtain @xmath229    this function monotonically decreases with repsect to @xmath197 in the acceptable range of @xmath197 , with the maximum value about @xmath230 for @xmath231 .",
    "as one expects , the tensor to scalar ratio vanishes for @xmath232 since it requires the initial point to be the fixed point ( figure [ fig : tensortoscalar ] ) .",
    "therefore we learn that the model needs a super - planckian value for @xmath106 to work properly according to the available data from planck+wp+bao @xcite .",
    "there is another piece of observational information yet to be addressed .",
    "actually the oldest and the most well - known part of it . from the expansion of the power spectra for the curvature perturbations we have @xcite @xmath233",
    "thus , the planck constraint on @xmath205 implies an upper bound on the inflation energy scale @xmath234 which is readily transformed to the more useful form @xmath235 taking into account the slow - roll paradigm once more , we obtain @xmath236 which equivalently means @xmath237      for the potential ( [ original ] ) the dynamics is limited between two extrema .",
    "the first is similar to the previous case where the field starts rolling down from the vicinity of the @xmath114 axis and remains close to it throughout its motion .",
    "this is the most probable possibility due to the angular minimum of the potential and this is more or less the only possibility if one takes @xmath238 , because as it was discussed , in this situation , the origin becomes a saddle point and @xmath114 seems like an attractor path .",
    "but if we assume @xmath239 , then other paths are possible depending on different initial conditions , reminding that the nearer to the @xmath26 axis the less chance for the path to be chosen , again because of the angular behavior of the potential .",
    "but as a possibility , though a very weak one , we consider the ultimate radial path from the origin to one of the side saddle points at @xmath240 and then a curved orbit toward the true vacuum .",
    "note that the second part of the path could happen independently from the starting point .",
    "at the point where these different trajectories meet , some transient oscillations might happen , which are damped by the following inflationary period .",
    "generally , these two extreme paths could bring different expansions as we will discuss .",
    "for the moment , let us concentrate on the path from the origin toward the @xmath241 saddle point .",
    "remember that although this is not an attractor and the chance of following this path is low , still as we emphasized earlier , we consider it as a bound for what could happen . as long as we restrict ourselves to move on the @xmath242 axis",
    ", the effective potential can be simplified as @xmath243 which can be reordered as @xmath244 it can be recognized now that the potential is similar to ( [ ssb ] ) shifted by a constant .",
    "so we can proceed in a similar manner unless this time we set @xmath245 to obtain the amount of e - foldings in this part of the slow - roll path ; @xmath246 actually , the inflation could nt reach the saddle point at @xmath247 and @xmath248 since it is interrupted at @xmath249 due to the growth of the slow - roll parameter @xmath250 .",
    "this is a transitive situation and inflation starts quickly in a new path as we will consider shortly .",
    "the whole e - foldings through @xmath247 trajectory is @xmath251 to simplify the above expression , we invoke two facts ; first we know that the pivot scale leaves the horizon soon near the origin ( @xmath252 ) and second , the inflation stops essentially before @xmath253 so the last two terms make no considerable contribution and we finally obtain @xmath254 it is seen that the denominator could intensify the e - foldings by providing a semi - flat trajectory on the @xmath247 axis . but remember that this path is not likely to happen due to instability .",
    "now we can write @xmath255 however the effect of varying @xmath256 only slightly changes our picture about @xmath257 since @xmath258 all other features along this path more or less resemble the ordinary symmetry breaking case which was discussed earlier and we will consider this again from a different view . but inflation could happen along a completely different path ; starting from the saddle point and ending at the true vacuum . to have an estimation about the selected path due to its low kinetical energy we suppose that the fields remain in the radial minimum throughout their trajectory .",
    "therefore for obtaining the equation of the estimated path first we find the radial minimum of the potential in the polar form ( [ polar ] ) @xmath259 ignoring the @xmath260 solution , which correspond to the maximum at the origin , for a given angle @xmath82 the radial minimum obeys the following equation @xmath261 returning to the original cartesian form , we have @xmath262 setting @xmath57 we recover the @xmath0 symmetry as expected . the true vacua also satisfy the above equation . to simplify the analysis ,",
    "we will focus on the @xmath263 quarter and solve ( [ path ] ) for @xmath264 to obtain @xmath265 since we assume the @xmath146 regime , expanding the square root and keeping the most important terms we deduce @xmath266 or equivalently @xmath267 finally the above approximation allows us to recast the potential ( [ original ] ) in the form of a single field potential @xmath268 while for the supposed slow - roll path @xmath269 we estimate @xmath270 then obviously for @xmath271 we obtain @xmath272 as we expected , the inflation energy scale is determined by @xmath65 and @xmath106 since the height of the barrier depends on them",
    ". under this condition , the potential completely fits to the first new inflationary models called hill - top models @xcite with the general shape @xmath273 if we set @xmath274 , @xmath275 and @xmath276 then the model predictions are @xmath277 and @xmath278 which are in agreement with planck+wp+bao joint @xmath279 cl contours for lfm ( @xmath280 ) i.e. @xmath281 although @xmath106 is reduced compared to the original symmetry breaking case thanks to providing a longer curved trajectory with a smaller slope , the potential is still considered a super - planckian model without any known physical motivation . particularly , picci - quinn mechanism which is supposed to happen at qcd scale falls far bellow the needed energy of inflation and even the reheating process in the above hypothesis likely produces undesirable domain walls to explain the invisible axions .",
    "the other probable scenario is rolling down the origin of field space .",
    "first , let us see which direction is more likely to be chosen for rolling down .",
    "returning back to the field space polar coordinates we obtain @xmath282 for a certain @xmath46 , the @xmath247 line is always maximum while @xmath114 is a minimum so one probably expects slow - roll happen on the @xmath34 axis or at least it appears as an effective attractor .",
    "but as it is also obvious from ( [ tet ] ) , near the origin all directions appear on the same footing so the field could follow different trajectories later on .",
    "in other words , the path chosen is very sensitive to the initial conditions and despite that the @xmath34 axis is the most probable path , other options are not ruled out .",
    "simulations confirm this idea ( figure [ fig : slowroll ] ) . to analyze the inflationary scenario in this case ,",
    "first let us derive @xmath283 on the field space ; @xmath284    even if the ratio @xmath256 was not very small , we would rely on the smallness of @xmath285 with respect to @xmath286 to establish the following approximation @xmath287 the solution straightforwardly can be obtained as @xmath288 in which @xmath289 is an arbitrary constant which stems from arbitrariness in starting direction of the slow - roll .",
    "as @xmath290 gets closer to 1 , more sophisticated approximations will be necessary .",
    "for example , the above equation insures that the path outward origin remains linear with a good accuracy for small @xmath290 ratio , until the path meets the radial minimum at @xmath291 in which @xmath292 quite suddenly vanishes .",
    "this abrupt redirection of course could raise the chance of isocurvature density perturbations @xcite for large @xmath256 or even for small @xmath256 ratio at the end of inflation . but remember that expansion appears as a damping term and prevents the field to acquire much kinetic energy and the subsequent tumbling . in this",
    "regard , numerical simulations confirm the slow - roll parameter predictions and slow - roll continues up to the true vacuum vicinity despite the slow - roll redirection in the field space ( figure [ fig : slowroll1 ] ) . for",
    "now , let us see how the potential looks in an arbitrary radial direction . to this end , we switch to the polar coordinates once more and write the potential for a fixed arbitrary angle @xmath293 .",
    "@xmath294 again , we encounter a hill - top model as could be expected and as mentioned before we should nt worry about a slow - roll interrupt in the redirection point since the inflation continues more or less in the same manner up to the true vacuum .",
    "note that in a typical new inflation like what we consider , the first stages of inflation are much more effective in producing the e - foldings and the redirection always happens after these critical era such that gives us enough excuse for the mentioned approximations .",
    "this time we should define @xmath295 to check this against the previous results , we can take @xmath57 or @xmath296 expecting that both of these choices result in the constraint that we have already had from simple symmetry breaking in ( [ ssb ] ) .",
    "both of the above situations reduce ( [ mumu ] ) to @xmath180 then the hill - top constraint of @xmath297 readily yields @xmath298 which is approximately in accord with the previously achieved constraint . on the other hand , the bigger @xmath299 , the smaller @xmath106 required for matching with the observation . here",
    "a delicate point has to be taken into account .",
    "although in the derivation of ( [ mumu ] ) we have not considered any constraint on the @xmath290 ratio , but in order to have a multi - directional operation , @xmath300 is required , since the other case has the ability to bring about an imaginary @xmath301 in some directions which consequently changes the sign of @xmath302 in ( [ mumu ] ) . roughly speaking , @xmath290 controls the range of the angle @xmath303 in which the negative slope is seen from the origin : when @xmath300 then @xmath304 but in the opposite case this angle for the positive half space @xmath305 is obtained from @xmath306 the division by two here results from considering half plane .",
    "this conclusion is not surprising at all since for @xmath307 the origin becomes a saddle point as discussed earlier .",
    "when the @xmath307 inequality gets stronger , the @xmath34 axis plays the role of attractor more effectively .",
    "so in this regime we can ignore the @xmath26 field in the slow - roll stage such that the potential reduces to @xmath308 which were discussed fully earlier .",
    "it might be worth arguing that in the last case ( i.e. @xmath307 ) , the potential for the initial condition in which fields are located far from origin , imitates the chaotic inflation in the form of @xmath309 which continues along the trajectory to the true vacuum .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sub1 ] one observes the curved path from the saddle point on the @xmath26 axis toward the true vacuum at @xmath310 . to plot these graphs we simply calculated the absolute slope by @xmath311 to be more rigorous , the length of the projected interval between the two saddle points on the @xmath312 plane is @xmath313 and disappears as soon as @xmath314 reaches @xmath315 ( or gets bigger ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to take into account the new path provided for the fields slow - roll . to indicate what we exactly talk about one",
    "can refer to figure [ fig : fieldflow1 ] . as it is depicted in the figures , in the proposed potential",
    ", the slow - roll path could be completely different from the radial flow of an ordinary symmetry breaking .",
    "it is saying that the path is very sensitive to the initial conditions and the figures are just two possible paths among many .",
    "note that in figure [ fig : fieldflow1 ] the slow - roll comprises of two different paths ; a radial and a nearly circular path , in contrast to the @xmath316 case , in which the saddle points unite at the origin .",
    "as we have shortly discussed under the motivation topic , the latter case approximately reduces to the inverted hybrid inflation case @xcite , with high energy scale domain walls which are formed before the inflationary procedure .",
    "let us get back to the main trend and suppose @xmath81 .",
    "it was discussed earlier that the path consists of two distinct parts , a radial and a nearly circular one , although the circular part changes in shape as the inequality of @xmath81 becomes weaker .",
    "one has to note that if the slow - roll happens to be on the @xmath34 axis , then again the problem reduces to the ordinary symmetry breaking scenario and the circular path does nt appear anymore .",
    "the remaining possibility that has less importance relates to the case when @xmath286 is comparable to @xmath314 . as it was discussed earlier , in this case",
    "the slow - roll path is a curved line ( figure [ fig : fieldflow2 ] ) and for such trajectories , there are other methods to deal with the slow - roll process @xcite-@xcite . however , since recent observations are generally in favor of single field inflation , or at last , such models that evolve along an effectively single - field attractor solution @xcite , we limited our survey to the situations in which we can approximate our double field potential with a single field one .",
    "we estimated the domain wall properties for an explicitly broken @xmath0 symmetric potential introducing an approximation that nicely fits both the euler - lagrange equations with appropriate boundary conditions and the static version of viral theorem .",
    "we showed that adding one degree of freedom into our lagrangian in the form of a new field , helps us evade the domain wall domination problem of the ordinary @xmath89 kink without decreasing the scale energy of the potential .",
    "the price that has to be paid is relaxing the @xmath0 symmetry as an exact symmetry of the model .",
    "this allows us to have super - planckian scale of energy for the peak of the potential while the domain wall energy is sufficiently low to avoid conflict with observation .",
    "the exact allowed values of parameters are of course model dependent .",
    "more rigorously , it has to be first determined , in which cosmological era and correlation length ( horizon ) , the domain walls will form .",
    "the descending of @xmath0 to @xmath1 is not an unprecedented scenario and the same explicit symmetry breaking have been suggested as a remedy for invisible axion and two higgs doublet models . from an observational point of view , the model parameters could be set such that the wall explains any confirmed cmb residual dipole anisotropy . in the other extreme , we proposed the domain wall production to happen before inflation and claimed that for super - planckian values , this scenario could work properly .",
    "we thoroughly examined the potential as the source of inflation .",
    "we just focused on those cases which are reduced to a single field inflation since such models have received more appreciation after the planck data .",
    "our study indicated that all the mentioned scenarios could be classified into the `` new inflationary models '' and almost always into the hill - top subclass of it .",
    "we also introduced an analytic , though approximate proof for the well - known simple symmetry breaking potential which indicates nearly complete accordance with the previously obtained numerical values .",
    "we tried to encompass all inflationary possibilities of the potential .",
    "as briefly mentioned , there is hope to explain the possible cmb dipole anisotropy by means of domain walls , which could simultaneously solve the invisible axion problem .",
    "therefore , it is important to make a compromise between cosmological evidence , particle physics requirements and domain wall formation as we tried to do so .",

    "<S> we have analyzed a @xmath0 model which is broken explicitly to a @xmath1 model . </S>",
    "<S> the proposal results in generating two stable domain walls , in contrast with the more common @xmath2 version which is prevalently used to explain axion invisibility for @xmath3 model . we have been meticulous to take into account any possible relation with previous studies , even if they apparently belong to different lines of research . </S>",
    "<S> then we have scrutinized the domain wall properties of the model , proposing a rigorous approximate solution which fully satisfies boundary conditions and the static virial theorem simultaneously . invoking the mentioned approximation , </S>",
    "<S> we have been able to obtain an analytical insight about the effect of parameters on the domain wall features , particularly on their surface energy density which is of great importance in cosmological studies when one tries to avoid domain wall energy domination problem . </S>",
    "<S> next , we have mainly focused on the likely inflationary scenarios of the model , including saddle point inflation , again insisting on analytical discussions to be able to follow the role of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we have tried to categorize any inflationary scenario into the known categories to take advantage of the previous detailed studies under the inflationary topic over the decades . we have concluded that any successful inflationary scenario requires large fields definition for the model . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are mainly done analytically and numerical results are used as supportive material . </S>"
