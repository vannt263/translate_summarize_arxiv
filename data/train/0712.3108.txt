    "it is well - known that there are a wide variety of objects showing optical variability by various mechanisms in various time scales in the universe .",
    "for example , stars in the instability strip in a color - magnitude diagram show periodic variability by pulsations ( cepheids and rr lyrae ) , while cataclysmic variables show emergent variability induced by accretion flows from companion stars ( novae ) , magnetic reconnection or rotations ( dwarf stars ) .",
    "thermonuclear or core - collapse runaway explosions of massive stars are observed as supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "recent studies on optical afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , which are extremely energetic phenomena , are starting to reveal their nature .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) show irregular flux variability not only in the optical but also in other wavelengths .",
    "optically variable objects described above change their intrinsic brightness , but observed variability can be caused by other reasons .",
    "searches for microlensing events have aimed to test the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the dark matter in the halo of our galaxy could be made up of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) such as brown dwarfs or planets .",
    "many asteroids in solar system have been found as moving objects .",
    "many surveys for these optically variable objects have been carried out and have contributed to many important astronomical topics .    the _ cosmic distance ladder _",
    ", for example , were established partly based on studies of optically variable objects which are _ standardizable _ candles",
    ". observations of variable stars in nearby galaxies enable us to determine distances to them by period - luminosity relations of cepheids ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "recent deep high - resolution monitoring observations with hubble space telescope ( hst ) increased the number of nearby galaxies whose distances were measured using cepheids .",
    "well - sampled light curves of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) in galaxies with distance measurements by cepheids @xcite showed empirical relationships between their light curve shapes and their luminosity : intrinsically brighter sne ia declined more slowly in brightness @xcite .",
    "these relations led to the discoveries of an accelerated expansion of the universe by two independent sn ia search teams @xcite . in ongoing and planned sn surveys , sne ia are expected to set tight constraints on the value of the dark energy and its cosmological evolution if any .",
    "variable stars have been also used to trace galactic structure as standard candles .",
    "rr lyrae are old ( @xmath21 gyr ) bright ( @xmath22 mag ) low - mass pulsating stars with blue colors of @xmath23 and are appropriate for tracing structures in the halo .",
    "they can be selected as stars showing large variability ( @xmath24 mag in @xmath25-band ) in short periods of @xmath26 days @xcite .",
    "rr lyrae selected using multi - epoch imaging data obtained by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provided a possible cut - off of the galactic halo at @xmath27 kpc from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the subsequent studies on rr lyrae by sdss @xcite and the quasar equatorical survey team ( quest ; * ? ? ?",

    "optical variability of the first luminous agn ( quasar ) 3c 273 were recognized @xcite just after its discovery @xcite . since then",
    ", it has been known that almost all quasars show optical variability ; indeed , it is one of common characteristics of agn .",
    "quasar surveys such as sdss and the 2-degree field quasar redshift survey ( 2qz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been carried out mainly using optical multi - color selections .",
    "these surveys have made large catalogs of quasars @xcite and also found very high-@xmath28 quasars close to the reionization epoch @xcite . but efficiency of finding lower - luminosity agn using color selections are expected to be low because agn components get fainter compared with their host galaxy components . on the other hand , recent deep x - ray observations with asca , xmm - newton , and chandra satellites effectively found many distant low - luminosity agn as well as obscured agn .",
    "this high efficiency owes to faintness of host galaxies in x - ray and high transparency of dust to x - ray photons .",
    "x - ray observations can identify faint agn easily while finding even unobscured agn is difficult using optical color selections . however , since deep x - ray surveys over wide fields require a lot of telescope time ( e.g. @xmath29 ms exposure in the chandra deep field - north ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , optical variability is being recognized again as a good tracer for agn .",
    "some studies have succeeded in detecting optical variability of quasars @xcite , and finding many quasars by optical variability with the completeness as high as classical uv excess selections @xcite .",
    "comparison of sdss imaging data with older plate imaging data @xcite and sdss spectrophotometric data @xcite showed a clear anti - correlation between quasar luminosity and optical variability amplitude , as indicated in previous studies @xcite .",
    "therefore , optical variability can be an efficient tool to find low - luminosity agn if variable components can be extracted .",
    "ultra - deep optical variability surveys with wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) installed on hst actually found 24 galaxies with variable nuclei down to @xmath30 mag and @xmath31 mag , which are as faint as nearby seyfert galaxies ( @xmath32 ) at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found several tens of agn by optical variability using multi - epoch data with advanced camera for survey ( acs ) on board hst .",
    "the number densities of agn selected via optical variability can be of the same order as those selected via deep x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "however , samples from the hst imaging data were not large enough for statistical studies .",
    "the comparable number densities of variability - selected agn may indicate that there could be several populations of agn with different properties .",
    "furthremore , a search for faint transient objects with suprime - cam @xcite on subaru telescope revealed very faint agn variability in the nuclei of apparently normal galaxies , and found that such nuclei show very rapid ( @xmath34 a few days ) nuclear variability with a large fractional amplitude @xcite .",
    "such behavior is similar to that of the galactic center black hole , sgr a@xmath35 , rather than bright agn , possibly indicating different physical nature of accretion disks of very low luminosity agn and very luminous agn .",
    "object variability could affect searches for rare objects using non - simultaneous observational data .",

    "they succeeded in identifying a bright candidate spectroscopically as a lae at @xmath38 .",
    "another candidate without spectroscopic identifications could be just a transient object and the authors treated it as a marginal candidate .",
    "sn rate studies based on optical variability @xcite have sometimes confronted problems in classifying events due to insufficient observational data such as spectroscopic identifications , sufficient time samplings , and multi - wavelength measurements . given limited time on large telescopes",
    ", one can not make spectroscopic observations of all variable candidates ; thus , multi - wavelength imaging data and light curves in year - scale baselines are very useful to separate sne from other kinds of variable objects .",

    "[ fig : sxdfimage2 ] ]      the suprime - cam images have different psf size ( and shape ) in every epoch because of time - varying atmospheric seeing .",
    "therefore , we can not measure variability of objects by simply comparing flux within a fixed small aperture as @xcite and @xcite did for the hst wfpc2 images .",
    "@xcite used total magnitude for variability detections in the images obtained with the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) on hst because the psf varied with locations on the ccds of acs .",
    "accurate photometry itself of any kind for extended objects is often difficult",
    ". since variable components are almost always point sources , the light from non - variable extended components just increases the noise for variability detections .",
    "hence , we used an image subtraction method introduced by @xcite and developed by @xcite instead of using total magnitudes of objects . this subtraction method",

    "[ fig : imsub ] ]    we now describe details of the procedures for variability detection and our definitions of variable objects .",
    "first , we smoothed all the subtracted images with the psfs and detected positive and negative peaks of surface brightness in subpixel unit .",
    "then , in all the subtracted images , we selected objects whose aperture flux in a fixed diameter of 20 were above @xmath70 or below @xmath71 of the background fluctuations ( @xmath72 ) within the same aperture .",
    "the background fluctuations @xmath72 is obtained by calculating the standard deviation of 20 aperture flux in @xmath73 places around each positive or negative peak in the subtracted images .",
    "we inspected these variable candidates visually to exclude candidates around mis - subtracted regions .",
    "second , we defined the central coordinates of the variable object candidates as the flux - weighted averages of all the coordinates where significant variability were detected in the subtracted images in the first procedure .",
    "third , we did 20-diameter aperture photometry for all these variable object candidates in the subtracted images , the reference images of which were an image with the smallest psf size in each field , and scaled the aperture measurements to the total flux assuming that the variable components were always point sources .",
    "the factors to scale 20 aperture flux to total flux were calculated as ratios between 20 aperture flux and total flux for point sources in each image ( typically @xmath74 ) .",
    "we constructed total flux light curves of all the candidates and defined optically variable objects as objects showing more than @xmath75 ( @xmath76 : photometric errors in the light curves ) variability in at least one combination of the epochs in the light curves .",
    "we note that some variable objects have unreliable photometric points in the light curves . in the subtraction method ,",
    "very slight offsets ( even @xmath77 pixel ) for bright objects between two images which are used for the subtraction could provide significant _ dipole _ subtractions . when an object has both a positive peak above @xmath70 and a negative peak below @xmath71 locally ( around @xmath78 pixel square ) in a certain subtracted image used to make the light curve , the photometric point of the object at that epoch are regarded as unreliable .",
    "these epochs were not used in evaluating variability .",
    "we followed these procedures for all the five fields .",
    "finally , we made an optically variable object catalog consisting of @xmath79 objects in the area of @xmath3 deg@xmath4 ( @xmath80 variable objects deg@xmath15 ) .",
    "however , for widely spread galaxies or bright objects , subtracted images are sometimes insecurely extended and show bumpy features although saturated or non - linearity pixels were removed from the detections in advance .",
    "variability of these objects are considered marginal .",
    "when we exclude such marginally variable objects , the number of variable objects is @xmath5 ( @xmath81 variable objects deg@xmath15 ) .",

    "we note that detection completeness is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : completeness ] .    in principle , variability should be measured as changes of luminosity of objects .",
    "to do so , it is necessary to measure total flux of variable objects .",
    "however , this is possible only for point sources such as variable stars and quasars whose luminosity is much larger than that of their host galaxies . to measure variable agn separately from their host galaxies",
    "is difficult using ground - based imaging data especially when the flux of variable object is faint compared to the flux of the host .",
    "we measure the flux of the variable component ( @xmath86 ) as describe above . in this paper , we use variable component magnitudes ( @xmath87 ) to describe object variability , and we adopt the total magnitudes which are measured in the sxdf catalogs as the magnitudes of host objects .      in order to investigate",
    "how far the variable components are located from the centers of possible host objects , and their properties such as magnitudes and colors in the catalogs , we assigned host objects to all the variable objects .",
    "in general , agn and sne have their host galaxies while variable stars have no host objects . in this paper , we defined variable stars themselves as host objects to treat all the variable objects equally .",
    "we calculated projected distances of the variable components from the surrounding objects in the stacked images taken when the variable objects were in the faintest phases , and defined the nearest objects as the host objects .",
    "the positions of the host objects were measured as peaks of surface brightness of the images smoothed by the psfs . in the faintest phases of variable objects which may disappear ( i.e. sne ) ,",
    "host objects should be detected , but high-@xmath28 sne which ocuur in diffuse galaxies seem hostless in some cases . assigned host objects for such sne may not be real host galaxies .",
    "it is also possible that transient objects on faint host objects may have no equivalent host objects in the sxdf catalogs because the sxdf @xmath2-band images for the catalogs were made by stacking all the exposures except for those in 2005 . among @xmath5 variable objects ,",
    "the number of such objects , which do not have equivalent objects in the sxdf catalogs , is @xmath57 .",
    "these possible transient objects may be hostless sne and are treated as sne if their light curves satisfy a criterion described in  [ sec : criteriasnagn2 ] .",
    "the number of the possible transient objects is small and we do not exclude or discriminate them in most of the following discussions . in  [ sec : overall_nc ] , we discuss number densities of transient objects , which are defined as objects not detected in their faint phases ; objects appear in some epochs at positions where there are no objects detected in other epochs . in this paper ,",
    "the number of detections for each transient object is not considered in the definition of transient objects .",
    "information on host objects , such as total magnitudes and colors , is derived from integrated images which were obtained in various epochs in each band as shown in @xcite and they are averaged over the observational time spans .",

    "[ fig : classificationflowchart ] ]    we note again that the object photometric information is averaged over the observational time spans , but its effect on our statistical classifications and discussions is small even if objects are variable .",
    "we extracted variable stars from the variable object sample using the suprime - cam optical imaging and the irac mid - infrared imaging data .",
    "since the irac data covers @xmath128 of the variability survey field in the sxdf , we concentrate on the @xmath132 variable objects in the overlapped region of @xmath127 deg@xmath4 for the following discussions such as object classifications and number densities .",
    "star selection is based on the optical morphologies , optical magnitudes , optical colors , and optical and mid - infrared colors of the variable objects .",
    "we used total magnitudes in both optical and mid - infrared wavelengths to make this selection .",
    "first , we assigned to all the variable objects _ morphological scores _",
    "( @xmath135 ) and _ color scores _ ( @xmath136 ) using a method described in @xcite .",
    "the _ morphological scores _",
    "@xmath137 were calculated based on magnitude differences @xmath138 between 20 aperture magnitudes ( @xmath139 ) and 30 aperture magnitudes ( @xmath140 ) , and the class_star values in all the five broad - bands from the sextractor @xcite outputs in the sxdf catalogs . if an object has @xmath141 , we add @xmath58 to @xmath142 .",
    "if a class_star value of an object is larger than some value ( typically @xmath143 , small variations from field to field ) we also add @xmath58 to @xmath142 .",
    "the _ color scores _",
    "@xmath144 were assigned based on the distances from the stellar loci in two color - color planes , @xmath145 versus @xmath146 and @xmath146 versus @xmath147 , using the sextractor output isophotmag .",
    "the stellar loci were defined using colors of a small set of bright stars .",
    "the color score represents the probability that each object is inside the stellar locus in color - color space using a monte carlo approach .",
    "a measure of the degree to which the colors of an object ( including their uncertainties ) fall within the stellar locus at the point of closest approach .",
    "values range from @xmath148 ( color is completely outside the stellar locus ) to @xmath149 ( color is completely within the locus )",
    ". objects with larger values for both scores are more likely to be stars , and the most likely stars should have @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "however , faint , red or blue stars are likely to have lower values for both the scores because of the low signal - to - noise ratio of photometry in some bands . in this classification , stars redder than g stars were not used for determining the stellar loci .",
    "the reddest stellar locus is at @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , red stars with @xmath153 can not have high values of @xmath144 and we do not use @xmath154 values for red stars with @xmath153 .",
    "galaxies with similar colors can contaminate into the sample .",
    "however , they can be excluded by an optical - mid - infrared color selection described below .",
    "another problem is color differences of stars due to differences in their metallicity .",
    "bright stars used for determining the stellar loci are mainly disk stars , while fainter stars are likely to belong to the halo population .",
    "color differences in @xmath147 caused by the population difference appear at @xmath155 , so , faint red stars with @xmath155 tend to have low @xmath154 values ; we decided to classify point - like objects with @xmath155 as stars .",
    "hence , we first assigned stellar likelihood to all the variable objects through five criteria using only optical photometric information ,    * stars with @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( point - like objects with stellar colors ) , * probable stars with @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( less point - like objects with less stellar colors ) , * probable stars with @xmath150 and @xmath155 ( point - like objects with red colors ) , * possible stars with @xmath153 ( objects with very red colors ) , * non - stellar objects which do not satisfy any criteria above .    objects satisfying one of the criteria , a ) , b-1 ) , b-2 ) , or c ) are considered as stars .    in order to check the validity of our star selections based on only optical imaging parameters",

    "the distributions contain three sequences and two of them , sequences for younger disk population and older halo population are reasonably duplicated by the model .",
    "another sequence of faint blue point - like objects has almost the same distribution as more extended galaxies in this diagram .",
    "then , we concluded that these faint blue point - like objects are galaxies , and adopted one more criterion , @xmath158 ( dashed line in the top panel of figure [ fig : colorcolor ] ) , to exclude them      second , we investigated optical - mid - infrared colors of the variable objects in a @xmath147 versus @xmath159 color - color plane .",
    "as shown in previous studies on object distributions in optical and mid - infrared color - color planes @xcite , stars and galaxies are more distinctly separated in optical - mid - infrared color - color planes than in purely optical color - color planes because of the very different temperatures of stars and dust .",
    "figure [ fig : colorcolor ] shows color - color diagrams of the variable objects for @xmath147 versus @xmath160 in the bottom left panel and @xmath147 versus @xmath159 in the bottom right panel .",

    "we plot all the variable objects in small gray triangles , _ probable stars _ in large open circles , and _ reliable stars _ in large filled circles . a criterion indicated in a dashed line in the top panel , @xmath158 , is adopted to exclude point - like blue galaxies .",

    "the stellar and galaxy sequences in the @xmath147 versus @xmath159 color - color diagram join together around @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "objects in this region can be contaminated with galaxies .",
    "there are several spectroscopically identified galaxies in the region , although they are not recognized as stars due to their optical extended morphologies .",
    "point sources showing optical variability can be luminous quasars , but optical - mid - infrared colors of quasars are red enough to be discriminated from stars .",
    "all the 35 sdss quasars at @xmath174 @xcite and 259 sdss quasars at @xmath163 @xcite have redder optical - mid - infrared colors ( @xmath175 , shown as a large ellipse ) as well as quasars in our sample than stars with similar optical colors .",
    "we also examined the robustness of star selections by comparing the star count in @xmath25-band with that predicted by the besanon model .",
    "stars in the sxdf were selected from the catalogs in the same criteria as for the variable objects .",
    "star counts including _ reliable stars _ , _ probable stars _ , and _ possible stars _ in the sxdf reasonably agree with the model prediction in @xmath176 . in the bottom right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : colorcolor ] .",
    "there can be seen several @xmath177 point sources with stellar optical - mid - infrared colors and low color scores @xmath154 on the stellar sequence ( gray circles below the dot - dashed line ) .",
    "these low color scores @xmath154 may derive from non - simultaneous observations and their variability . in this way",
    ", our classifications based on colors of objects could be inaccurate because of non - simultaneous observations , but many facts described above indicate that variable stars are securely selected through the criteria with small contaminations and high completeness .",
    "the _ reliable stars _ , _ probable stars _ and _ possible stars _ , @xmath178 objects in total ( @xmath127 deg@xmath4 , @xmath12 objects deg@xmath15 ) , make up our sample of variable stars in subsequent discussions .",
    "after we selected variable stars , we classified non - stellar variable objects into sne and agn based on two parameters from the optical imaging data : the offset of the location of variable component from the host object and the light curve .",
    "first , we examined the offsets between the variable components and their host objects .",
    "variability should be observed at the centers of the host objects for agn as well as stars , while sne can explode at any position relative to the host objects . in order to estimate the errors of the locations of variable components for agn , we examined the offsets for optically variable x - ray sources .",
    "most of the x - ray sources are considered to be agn .",
    "some of them can be stars emitting x - ray , but for our purposes , that is not a problem : variable stars also should show variability at their centers .",
    "almost all of the x - ray detected variable objects ( @xmath179 ) have spatial offsets below @xmath58 pixel ( @xmath180 ) , and the offsets distribute with a scatter of @xmath181 pixel .",
    "we also examined offsets for simulated variable objects used in calculations of detection completeness in  [ sec : completeness ] , and found that their offsets from the located positions range with a scatter of @xmath182 pixel , slightly larger than that of x - ray sources .",
    "we set the threshold between _ central variability _",
    "( variability at the central positions ) and _ offset variability _ ( variability at the offset positions ) to @xmath183 pixel , which is @xmath184 ( using the average of these two error estimates ) .",
    "we also used light curves to discriminate sne from agn .",
    "bright phases where we detect object variability should be limited to within one year for sne for two reasons .",
    "first , multiple sne very rarely appear in a single galaxy within our observational baselines .",
    "second , any sne should become fainter than our detection limit within one year after the explosions in the observed frame .",
    "sne ia , the brightest type except for hypernovae and some of type - iin sne , can be seen at @xmath185 at our detection limit ( @xmath6 mag ) .",
    "one year in the observed frame corresponds to five months in the rest frame at @xmath186 due to the time dilation by cosmological redshift .",
    "therefore , sne should fade by more than @xmath94 mag below the maximum brightness ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this decrease of brightness is a minimum value of observed declining magnitudes of sne and is almost the same as the dynamic range of our detection for variability ( @xmath187 mag ) .",
    "hence , we defined objects which are at bright phases for less than one year , and are stably faint in the remainder of the observations , as  objects with sn - like light curves  . in order to apply this criterion for the variable objects ,",
    "it is necessary for light curves to cover more than three years at least . in two fields ( sxdf - n and sxdf - w ) ,",
    "our images cover only two years , 2002 and 2003 ; therefore , variable objects in these two fields can not be classified as like or unlike sne .",
    "hence , we concentrate on the other three fields ( sxdf - c , sxdf - s , and sxdf - e ) to discuss number densities of sne and agn based on robust classifications . among @xmath188 variable objects in these three fields , @xmath189 objects are classified as non - stellar objects .",
    "out of @xmath189 non - stellar variable objects , light curves of @xmath190 objects cover only two years because of insecure subtractions in some epochs .",
