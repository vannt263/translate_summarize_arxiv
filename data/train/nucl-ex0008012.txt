    "mercury is planned to be used as a target material in all the present - day designs of the spallation neutron source ( sns ) facilities @xcite@xcite , thus necessitating that the proton - hg interaction characteristics should be studied in a broad energy range from a few mev to 2 - 3 gev . among the characteristics , the yields of residual product nuclei are of particular importance .",
    "they are independent nuclear constants to be used in practical calculations as well as to verify the codes for calculating the sns facility design parameters , such as radioactivity ( both current and residual ) , deterioration of resistance to corrosion , yields of gaseous products , poisoning , etc .",
    "the experimental samples are 10.5-mm diameter discs manufactured by pressing fine - dispersed powder .",
    "the weight contents of impurities in the samples do not exceed 0.16% , of which 0.01% si , 0.03% cl , 0.02% ca , 0.04% ti , 0.03% fe , and 0.01% ba .",
    "the total content of the rest 60 elements , found by the spark mass - spectrometry , is below 0.02% .",
    "the measurements were made by the relative method , using the ( p , x ) reaction to monitor the process .",
    "the monitors are 10.5-mm al foils with chemical impurities below 0.001% .",
    "two independent proton beams from the itep u-2 synchrotron are used to irradiate the samples , namely , the low - energy ( 70 - 200 mev ) and high - energy ( 800 - 2600 mev ) beams .",
    "table [ tab1 ] presents the characteristics of the experimental samples and monitors together with the main irradiation parameters .",
    "the techniques for irradiating the samples and for processing the @xmath0-spectra are presented in @xcite together with formulas used to determine the fragment nuclide yields .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .parameters of experimental samples and monitors , irradiation conditions , and monitor reaction cross sections [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ tab2 ] , n@xmath1 is the total number of the measured yields ; n@xmath2 is the number of the measured yields selected to be used in comparison with calculations ; n@xmath3 is the number of the products whose yields were simulated by a particular code ; n@xmath4 is the number of the comparison events when the simulation - experiment difference does not exceed 30% ; n@xmath5 is the number of the comparison events when the simulation - experiment difference does not exceed a factor of 2 .                        figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig4 ] show the results of the nuclide - by - nuclide comparison of the experimental data with the lahet , cem95 , cem2k , cascade , inucl , and the yieldx code - simulated results .",
    "one can see that all codes ( except yieldx ) adequately predict the a@xmath6170 product yields for 100 , 200 , and 800 mev protons and the a@xmath6120 product yields for 2600 mev protons .",
    "the yields simulated by all the codes in the remaining ranges of masses , i.e. , in the fission and fragmentation regions , are very different from experiment , with the most significant differences observed in the 80@xmath7a@xmath7103 range for 100 and 200 mev protons , in the 48@xmath7a@xmath7130 range for 800 mev protons , and in the 28@xmath7a@xmath7100 range for 2600 mev protons .",
    "it should be noted that cem95 and cem2k do not calculate the process of fission itself , and do not provide fission fragments and a further possible evaporation of particles from them .",
    "when , during a monte carlo simulation of a compound stage of a reaction using the evaporation and fission widths these codes have to simulate a fission , they simply remember this event ( that permits them to calculate fission cross section and fissility ) and finish the calculation of this event without a real subsequent calculation of fission fragments .",
    "therefore , the results from cem95 and cem2k shown here reflect the contribution to the total yields of the nuclides only from deep spallation processes of successive emission of particles from the target , but do not contain fission products . to be able to describe nuclide production in the fission region , these codes have to be extended by incorporating a model of high energy fission ( e.g. , in the transport code mcnpx , where these code are used ,",
    "they are complemented by the ral fission model ) .    figs .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig8 ] show the simulated mass yield of the reaction products",
    ". the experimental cumulative yields , which are often equal to the mass yields within measurement errors , are also shown for comparison .",
    "the following conclusions may be drawn from the comparison between the experimental and simulated mass yields :    * in the case of 0.1 gev protons and a@xmath6190 , all codes predict the mass curve shape quite adequately , * in the case of 0.2 gev protons and a@xmath6180 , all code - simulated yields are in a good agreement with the data , * in the case of 0.8 gev protons , the best agreement with experiment is obtained by yieldx , for a@xmath6130 and by inucl , for a@xmath7130 , * in the case of 2.6 gev protons and a@xmath6100 , the cem95 and cascade results agree with the data , while the lahet calculations are underestimated and the yieldx and inucl yields represent the mass curve shape erroneously .",
    "none of the codes can describe well the experimental curve shape at a@xmath7100 .",
    "[ fig9 ] illustrates the dependence of a part of measured yields on the proton energy , i.e. , excitation functions .",
    "these data will be analyzed further after a final release of all the experimental results .",
    "our experiment - to - simulation comparison has shown that , on the whole , the simulation codes can but poorly predict the experimental results . in some cases ,",
    "the differences reach an order of magnitude or even more .",
    "the last version of the improved cascade - exciton model code , cem2k [ 5 ] , shows the best agreement with the data in the spallation region at all energies except 2.6 gev , where the model overestimates the expected experimental fission cross section of about 75 mb [ 6 ] by a factor of 4 .",
    "this overestimation of the fission cross section causes an underestimation of the yield of nuclei which are most likely to fission at the evaporation stage of a reaction , after the cascade and preequilibrium stages , i.e. , for 170 @xmath7 a @xmath7 185 .",
    "( similar disagreement with the data one can see as well for lahet and cem95 , that is also related with an overestimation of the fission cross section at 2.6 gev ) .",
    "the code cem2k is still under development , its problem with the overestimation of fission cross sections at energies above 1 gev has yet to be solved , and it has to be complemented with a model of fission fragment production as mentioned above , to be able to describe as well fission products .",
    "this means that the nuclear data must be accumulated persistently in the above - mentioned ranges of energies and masses , to help improve hadron - nucleus interaction models released in codes used in applications .",
