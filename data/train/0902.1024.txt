    "over the last six decades , exactly solvable models of interacting many - body systems have attracted considerable attention due to their uncoverable role in a fundamental understanding of order - disorder phenomena @xcite . in particular , exactly solvable quantum spin models",
    "are currently at a forefront of theoretical research interest as they often exhibit a peculiar interplay between quantum fluctuations and cooperativity @xcite . despite extensive studies ,",
    "however , phase transitions and critical phenomena of rigorously solved quantum spin models still belong to the most challenging unresolved issues to deal with , since quantum fluctuations usually prefer a lack of spontaneous order . indeed , there are only few exactly solved quantum spin models that simultaneously exhibit both spontaneous long - range order , as well as , obvious quantum manifestations .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated that the spontaneous order , which is accompanied with obvious quantum manifestations , might be an inherent feature of the hybrid ising - heisenberg planar models whose lattice sites are in part occupied by the ising spins and partly by the heisenberg spins @xcite .",
    "note that all aforementioned ising - heisenberg planar models have exactly been solved with the help of suitable algebraic transformations such as the decoration - iteration @xcite or the star - triangle @xcite transformation , which establish a precise mapping equivalence with the corresponding spin-1/2 ising model .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall , moreover , that the decoration - iteration and star - triangle mapping transformations were substantially generalized by fisher @xcite ( see for details also ref .",
    "@xcite ) who firstly pointed out that in principle arbitrary quantum - mechanical system coupled to two or three outer ising spins can be replaced via appropriate algebraic transformation by the equivalent expression containing pairwise spin - spin interactions between the outer ising spins . in such a way",
    ", one effectively establishes a precise mapping relationship that connects the exact solution of some original model ( which might describe a rather complex quantum - mechanical system ) with the exact solution of the corresponding spin-1/2 ising model , which is generally known for many planar lattices of different topologies @xcite .    on the contrary ,",
    "there does not exist a general algebraic transformation for any quantum - mechanical system coupled to four or more outer ising spins if one considers pairwise interactions between the outer ising spins only @xcite .",
    "et al_. @xcite has recently found an exact evidence that it is nevertheless possible to include multispin interactions between the outer ising spins into the algebraic transformation in order to ensure its general validity .",
    "thus , the algebraic transformation with effective pair and quartic interactions is for instance required when searching for an exact treatment of the quantum - mechanical system coupled to four outer ising spins in an absence of the external field .",
    "the spin-1/2 ising model with pair and quartic interactions is however nothing but the alternative definition of the general eight - vertex model @xcite , which becomes exactly tractable by imposing a special additional constraint to its vertex energies ( boltzmann s weights ) known either as the baxter s zero - field ( symmetric ) condition @xcite or the free - fermion condition of fan and wu @xcite .",
    "bearing all this in mind , one could intuitively expect that there might exist a certain class exactly solvable quantum - mechanical spin models for which the appropriate algebraic transformation yields a precise mapping correspondence to the eight - vertex model generally satisfying the baxter s zero - field condition @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to show that the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the pair xyz heisenberg interaction and the quartic ising interactions falls into this class of fully exactly soluble models .",
    "an importance of exact results to be obtained for the ising - heisenberg model with the pair and quartic interactions should be viewed in more respects .",
    "first , it is well known that the quartic interaction basically affects magnetic properties of several insulating copper compounds such as la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite ( undoped parent compound for high-@xmath2 cuprates ) , srcu@xmath0o@xmath3 @xcite , la@xmath4ca@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 @xcite , and la@xmath1sr@xmath8cu@xmath6o@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "even though it would be rather striking coincidence if some real magnetic material would obey very specific topological requirements of the model under investigation , it is quite reasonable to suspect that our exact results might at least shed light on some important aspects of the critical behavior of real magnetic materials .",
    "second , our model system represents a rare example of the exactly solved lattice - statistical model , which contradicts the standard universality hypothesis in that its critical exponents vary continuously with the interaction parameters over the full range of possible values of the critical exponents .",
    "third , the exactly soluble vertex models have found over the last few decades manifold applications in seemingly diverse research areas .",
    "exact solutions of vertex - like models essentially tackles the problem of the residual entropy of two - dimensional ice @xcite , the slater model of hydrogen - bonded ferroelectrics @xcite , the integrable quantum spin models such as the quantum heisenberg chain @xcite , the ice - type solid - on - solid ( sos ) model @xcite , the problem of counting domino tilings @xcite , the three- and four - coloring problems of the square and hexagonal lattices @xcite , etc .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will provide the detailed description of the hybrid ising - heisenberg model and then , basic ideas of the exact mapping to the zero - field eight - vertex model will be explained .",
    "this is followed by the presentation of the most interesting results for the ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams , which are supplemented by a detailed analysis of a rather strange non - universal behavior of critical exponents .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "consider a two - dimensional lattice of edge - sharing octahedrons , each of them having four ising spins @xmath9 in a basal plane and two heisenberg spins @xmath10 in apical positions , as it is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "suppose furthermore that each edge of the octahedron , which connects two ising spins , is a common edge of two adjacent octahedrons ( thin solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the ensemble of all ising spins then forms a square lattice , which has a couple of the heisenberg spins above and below a center of each elementary square face formed by four ising spins .",
    "let both apical heisenberg spins interact together via the pairwise xyz heisenberg interaction ,        while they are also assumed to be engaged in two different quartic ising interactions with two ising spins from opposite corners of a square face ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be for convenience written as a sum over all elementary unit cells ( octahedrons ) @xmath11 , where each octahedron - cluster hamiltonian @xmath12 contains one pair interaction between the apical heisenberg spins and two quartic interactions between the heisenberg spins and their four ising neighbors @xmath13 above , the interaction parameters @xmath14 denote spatial components of the anisotropic xyz interaction between the heisenberg spins , while the interaction parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 label two quartic ising interactions between both apical heisenberg spins and two ising spins from opposite corners of a square face along two different diagonal directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is of principal importance that the cluster hamiltonians of two different octahedrons commute with each other , i.e. @xmath17 = 0 $ ] , which immediately allows a partial factorization of the total partition function into a product of cluster partition functions @xmath18 the summation @xmath19 to emerge in eq .",

    ", the partition function of the ising - heisenberg model can be rewritten into the form @xmath25 apparently , the effective boltzmann s factor @xmath26 assigned to the @xmath21th octahedron now explicitly depends just on four ising spins @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 from its basal plane through the relation    @xmath31    where we have introduced a new unified notation for the coupling constants @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) in order to write the boltzmann s factor ( [ bf ] ) in a more abbreviated and elegant form .    at this stage",
    ", the model under investigation can be rather straightforwardly mapped to the eight - vertex model on its dual square lattice . as a matter of fact , the product emerging in eq .",
    "( [ pf2 ] ) can alternatively be performed over all elementary squares of the ising spins forming a square lattice and the boltzmann s factor ( [ bf ] ) is invariant under the reversal of all four ising spin variables . in this respect , there are at the utmost eight different spin arrangements that have different energies ( boltzmann s weights ) and these can readily be related to the boltzmann s weights of the eight - vertex model on a dual square lattice by the following procedure . if , and",
    "only if , the ising spins located at adjacent corners of a square face are aligned opposite to each other , then solid lines are drawn on edges of a dual square lattice , otherwise they are drawn as broken lines .",
    "this is actually one of many alternative definitions of the eight - vertex model , since an even number of solid ( broken ) lines is always incident to each vertex of a dual square lattice .",
    "the diagrammatic representation of eight possible spin arrangements and their corresponding line coverings is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    " denotes the spin state @xmath34.,width=321 ]    it can be easily understood that each of eight possible line arrangements around a vertex of the dual lattice corresponds to two spin configurations , one is being obtained from the other by reversing all four ising spins located at corners of an elementary square face .",
    "the hybrid ising - heisenberg model thus turns out to be equivalent with the eight - vertex model . with regard to this equivalence",
    ", the partition function of the ising - heisenberg model can be expressed in terms of the partition function of the eight - vertex model on a square lattice @xmath35 the factor 2 in the above equation comes from the two - to - one mapping between the spin and vertex configurations ( two spin configurations always correspond to one vertex configuration ) .    the boltzmann s weights , which correspond to eight possible line coverings of the eight - vertex model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , can directly be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ bf ] ) by substituting a respective spin configuration of the ising spins @xmath36 it is quite obvious from the set of eqs .",
    "( [ bw1])-([bw7 ] ) that the boltzmann s weights are pairwise equal to each other and there are merely four independent boltzmann s weights . the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model defined through the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    "has been accordingly mapped to the eight - vertex model , which quite generally satisfies the baxter s zero - field condition @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "hence , it follows that the exact solution of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the pair xyz heisenberg interaction and the quartic ising interactions can be extracted from the baxter s exact solution of the corresponding zero - field eight - vertex model @xcite .",
    "for instance , the critical condition of the zero - field eight - vertex model @xmath41 directly determines phase transitions of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model if the effective boltzmann s weights ( [ bw1])-([bw7 ] ) are substituted into this critical condition .",
    "it is also worthy to mention that the critical exponents , which characterize the phase transitions of the zero - field eight - vertex model , continuously change with the parameter @xmath42 by following the formulas @xmath43 note that the set of relations ( [ ce ] ) will also govern changes of the critical exponents of the ising - heisenberg model provided that the effective boltzmann s weights ( [ bw1])-([bw7 ] ) are used for a calculation of the parameter @xmath44 .    to provide an alternative proof of the exact mapping equivalence between the zero - field eight - vertex model and the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model",
    ", one can utilize the fact that the eight - vertex model on a square lattice can also be reformulated as two spin-1/2 ising square lattices coupled together by means of the quartic interaction @xcite . in accordance with this statement , the effective boltzmann s factor ( [ bf ] ) could be eventually replaced via appropriate algebraic transformation of the form @xmath45 where the mapping parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the effective pair interactions in two different ising square lattices and the mapping parameter @xmath48 determines the effective quartic interaction that couples together both ising square lattices . the algebraic transformation ( [ amt ] ) must satisfy the self - consistency condition , which means that it must hold independently of spin states of four ising spins involved therein .",
    "the self - consistency condition thus provides a simple connection between the effective boltzmann s weights ( [ bw1])-([bw7 ] ) of the ising - heisenberg model and the coupling parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 of the zero - field eight - vertex model in the ising representation @xmath49 this is actually an alternative proof of the exact mapping equivalence between the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model and the zero - field eight - vertex model on a square lattice .",
    "the usefulness of the latter equivalence consists in that another three useful observations can be made from it .",
    "first , it is quite evident from eqs .",
    "( [ ev2 ] ) and ( [ ev3 ] ) that the effective pair interactions of both ising square lattices become equal to each other ( @xmath50 ) by imposing the condition @xmath51 , which is equivalent to @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) .",
    "this means that a difference in two diagonal quartic ising interactions merely causes a difference in the effective pair interactions of the ising square lattices .",
    "second , the quartic interaction @xmath48 that couples together two ising square lattices vanishes only if at least one from both quartic ising interactions @xmath54 or @xmath55 ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) equals zero provided that all interactions are finite .",
    "another particular cases with the zero effective quartic interaction @xmath48 are the ising and xy limit of the heisenberg pair interaction .",
    "one actually obtains @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in the ising limit @xmath59 , whereas @xmath56 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is obtained in the xy limit @xmath62 .",
    "apart from these rather trivial cases from the ising universality class , one may expect that the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model will generally exhibit continuously varying critical exponents satisfying the weak universality hypothesis @xcite due to the non - zero effective quartic interaction @xmath48 .",
    "third , the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model defined through the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can in turn be refined by the terms depending on the ising spin pairs @xmath63 and @xmath64 without disturbing the exact mapping equivalence to the zero - field eight - vertex model . as a matter of fact ,",
    "an inclusion of two diagonal pair interactions @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the quartic interaction @xmath67 into the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) merely adds the respective coupling constant as an auxiliary constant factor into a definition of the mapping parameter ( [ ev2 ] ) , ( [ ev3 ] ) , and ( [ ev4 ] ) , respectively .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that the model system is mapped to the more general and yet unsolved eight - vertex model by introducing the nearest - neighbor pair interactions @xmath68 and @xmath69 into the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) . even though there does not exist the general exact solution of the corresponding eight - vertex model ,",
    "it is now well established that the critical exponents still vary continuously with the interaction parameters even for this more complex but surely more realistic model @xcite .",
    "before proceeding to a discussion of the most interesting results , it is worthy to notice that our further analysis will be restricted just to a particular example of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the identical quartic ising interactions @xmath70 and the more symmetric xxz heisenberg interaction with @xmath71 , @xmath72 in order to avoid over - parametrization of the model under investigation . furthermore , it also convenient to normalize all interaction parameters with respect to the @xmath73-component of the xxz heisenberg interaction , which will henceforth serve as the energy unit .",
    "accordingly , the dimensionless temperature will be set to @xmath74 , a relative strength of the quartic ising interactions will be proportional to the ratio @xmath75 , and finally , the parameter @xmath76 will measure a relative strength of the exchange anisotropy in the xxz heisenberg interaction .",
    "let us perform first a comprehensive analysis of the ground state .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the ground - state spin arrangement will be thoroughly determined by the lowest - energy eigenstate that enters into the greatest boltzmann s weight , since each boltzmann s weight involves four eigenenergies that correspond to possible eigenstates of the heisenberg spin pair at a given configuration of the ising spins ( remember that the ising spin configurations are unambiguously assigned to the boltzmann s weights according to a scheme depicted in fig .",

    "( [ bwxxz ] ) that the greatest boltzmann s weight is either @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "besides , another useful observation is that both these boltzmann s weights are simply connected through the relation @xmath80 and one may further assume the positive quartic ising interaction @xmath81 without loss of generality .",
    "this simplification is a direct consequence of the affirmation that the investigated model system is invariant under the transformation @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram must be therefore symmetric with respect to the @xmath84 axis and the respective spin arrangements to emerge in a sector @xmath85 can be obtained from its symmetry related counterpart in a sector @xmath81 by a mere interchange of the ising spin configurations inherent to the boltzmann s weights @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    for better orientation , we will distinguish our subsequent analysis of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the ferromagnetic ( @xmath86 ) and antiferromagnetic ( @xmath87 ) heisenberg pair interaction , respectively .",
    "in the former case , the greatest boltzmann s weight is @xmath78 for @xmath88 and @xmath79 for @xmath89 , under the assumptions @xmath90 and @xmath81 ( note that the reverse conditions hold for the case @xmath85 ) . the global ground - state phase     in the @xmath91 plane .",
    "each sector of the phase diagram contains typical spin configurations of the ising and heisenberg spins , which form an elementary octahedron .",
    "the sign @xmath92 denotes spin states @xmath34 and @xmath93 of the ising and heisenberg spins , respectively .",
    "broken lines , which connect both apical heisenberg spins in the phases @xmath94 and @xmath95 , label the entangled spin state @xmath96.,width=302 ]    diagram of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the ferromagnetic heisenberg interaction is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . clearly , the ground - state diagram constitute four different phases @xmath97 which are written in a form of the product over the respective lowest - energy eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) that is of course identical for each elementary unit cell ( octahedron ) .",
    "note furthermore that the first ( second ) ket vector behind the product symbol determines spin states of the ising ( heisenberg ) spins and another equivalent representations of the eigenstates can be obtained from the eigenvectors ( [ gsa])-([gsd ] ) under the reversal of all ising and/or heisenberg spins .",
    "the phases @xmath98 and @xmath99 are consequently eight - fold degenerate as spin reversals of the ising and heisenberg spins can be performed independently of each other , whereas the phases @xmath94 and @xmath95 are just four - fold degenerate as the spin reversal of the heisenberg spins does not in fact lead to a new eigenstate .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that another two obvious features directly follow from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and eqs .",
    "( [ gsa])-([gsd ] ) .",
    "the heisenberg spins are ferromagnetically aligned with respect to each other in the phases @xmath98 and @xmath99 where @xmath88 , while they reside the entangled spin state @xmath96 in the phases @xmath94 and @xmath95 where @xmath89 .",
    "in addition , there appears a perfect ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment on a square lattice of the ising spins in the phases @xmath98 and @xmath95 in contrast to two feasible superantiferromagnetic orderings that occur in the phases @xmath94 and @xmath99 , where a perfect ferromagnetic arrangement of the ising spins in a horizontal direction is accompanied with a perfect antiferromagnetic arrangement in a vertical direction , or vice versa .",
    "the overall understanding of a nature of the aforedescribed spin arrangements readily follows from the energy spectrum of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg dimer .",
    "namely , the lowest - energy eigenstate of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg dimer is the ferromagnetic state @xmath100 if one considers the easy - axis exchange anisotropies @xmath88 , while the entangled spin state @xmath96 becomes the lowest - energy eigenstate for the easy - plane exchange anisotropies @xmath89 .",
    "the relevant spin arrangement of the ising spins is subsequently driven by the effort to minimize the energy gain arising from the quartic ising interactions . thus , there must be either zero or two spins with opposite orientation with respect to the others among the four spins ( two ising and two heisenberg ) involved in the positive quartic ising interaction @xmath81 , whereas there must be just one unaligned spin among them whenever the negative quartic ising interaction @xmath85 is assumed .",
    "surprisingly , the ground - state analysis becomes much more simple for the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath87 ) heisenberg interaction .",
    "it is quite apparent from the set of eqs .",
    "( [ bwxxz ] ) that the greatest boltzmann s weight is always being @xmath79 ( @xmath78 ) if one considers the positive ( negative ) quartic ising interaction .",
    "owing to this fact , the overall ground - state phase diagram constitute just two different phases @xmath101 whereas the phase @xmath102 is the ground state for @xmath81 and the phase @xmath103 for @xmath85 .",
    "it should be stressed that both four - fold degenerate phases @xmath102 and @xmath103 quite closely resemble the phases @xmath94 and @xmath95 described previously by the analysis of the ferromagnetic model . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the only difference between the phases @xmath102 and @xmath94 ( or @xmath103 and @xmath95 ) consists in a quantum entanglement of the heisenberg spin pairs , which is described by the antisymmetric singlet - dimer wave function @xmath104 in the antiferromagnetic model with @xmath87 and its symmetric counterpart @xmath96 in the ferromagnetic model with @xmath86 .",
    "now , let us turn our attention to a detailed analysis of the finite - temperature phase diagrams .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall that phase transition lines of our simplified version of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model can be straightforwardly obtained from the critical condition of the corresponding zero - field eight - vertex model by substituting the effective boltzmann s weights ( [ bwxxz ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) .",

    "interestingly , both critical conditions ( [ cclw ] ) and ( [ ccrw ] ) can be joined together to yield a single critical condition @xmath111 which is valid in a whole region of the parameter space .",
    "the absolute value of the quartic ising interaction appears in eq .",
    "( [ ccgen ] ) as a direct consequence of the symmetry relation between the boltzmann s weights @xmath80 , which are mutually interchangeable under the transformation @xmath82 .",
    "accordingly , the critical temperature of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model must be independent of the sign of the quartic ising interaction and one may still consider positive values of the quartic ising interaction @xmath81 without loss of the generality .",
    "henceforth , we will therefore restrict ourselves just to an analysis of the critical lines of the phases @xmath98 , @xmath94 , and @xmath102 emerging for the positive quartic ising interaction @xmath81 .",
    "it should be nevertheless mentioned that the critical lines for the phases @xmath99 , @xmath95 , and @xmath103 appearing in the case @xmath85 are formally identical with the displayed critical lines for the phases @xmath98 , @xmath94 , and @xmath102 , respectively .",

    "consequently , the critical condition ( [ cclw ] ) determines phase transitions just if the inequality ( [ nsc ] ) holds , while the critical condition ( [ ccrw ] ) is valid in the rest of the parameter space .",

    "regard , the left wings deliminate critical lines of the phase @xmath98 , whereas the right wings represent critical lines of the phase @xmath94 .",
    "the critical temperature of the phase @xmath98 at first steadily decreases as the exchange anisotropy @xmath114 is raised from zero , then it exhibits an interesting re - entrant behavior before it finally tends to zero in the limit @xmath115 .",
    "it is noticeable that the re - entrant phase transitions are observable just in a relatively narrow interval of the exchange anisotropies @xmath116 , whose upper bound @xmath117 is the greater , the greater a relative strength of the quartic ising interaction is .",
    "contrary to this , the right wing of critical lines , which allocate phase transitions of the phase @xmath94 , characterizes a monotonous increase of the critical temperature with the exchange anisotropy .",
    "an origin of the observed re - entrant transitions obviously lies in two times higher degeneracy of the phase @xmath98 compared to the phase @xmath94 .",
    "accordingly , two successive re - entrant transitions from the paramagnetic phase to the phase @xmath98 and back may take place in the parameter region , where the phase @xmath94 constitutes the ground state and the phase @xmath98 has slightly higher energy , on account of the much larger entropy gain of the phase @xmath98 obtained upon the temperature increase .",
    "it is worthy to mention that similar re - entrant phase transitions have been found in a variety of frustrated ising models , which have been exactly solved by establishing a precise mapping relationship with the corresponding free - fermion vertex models @xcite . to bring a deeper insight into the re - entrant phenomenon , it is also worthwhile to inspect the disorder solution to be derived from the condition @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the disorder temperature .",

    "from this perspective , the most obvious difference between the critical temperatures of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ising - heisenberg models appears in a vicinity of the isotropic limit @xmath113 , where the critical temperature of the ferromagnetic model asymptotically vanishes due to the zero - temperature phase transition between the phases @xmath98 and @xmath94 .    at this point ,",
    "let us make certain comments on changes of critical exponents along the critical lines .",
    "for this purpose , typical changes of the critical exponent @xmath124 along the phase transition line of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the ferromagnetic heisenberg interaction and @xmath125 are depicted in fig .",

    "it turns out that the investigated model system generally exhibits rather smooth continuous phase transitions , since the order of phase transition is proportional to @xmath128 ( see for instance pp .",
    "1617 in ref . ) and the critical exponent @xmath124 lies within the range @xmath129 .",
    "the most striking finding is , however , that the critical exponent @xmath124 exhibits a peculiar singularity in a vicinity of the ground - state boundary between the phases @xmath98 and @xmath94 where @xmath130 .",
    "owing to this fact , the zero - temperature phase transition between the phases @xmath98 and @xmath94 emerging at @xmath113 is of infinite order and hence , this special critical point actually represents a remarkable quantum critical point .",
    "it is also worthy to notice that the displayed variations of the critical exponent @xmath131 quite closely resemble dependences of other critical exponents @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 due to a similar mathematical structure of the relations ( [ ce ] ) .    furthermore , the changes of the critical exponent @xmath124 along the critical line of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the antiferromagnetic heisenberg interaction are shown in fig .",

    "it is also quite interesting to notice that the critical exponent @xmath124 monotonically increases from its smallest value at @xmath137 before it gradually tends towards @xmath138 in the limit @xmath123 .",
    "altogether , the critical lines of both ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic model turned out to be the lines of continuous phase transitions of the order @xmath136 , but the ferromagnetic model generally exhibits much more pronounced changes of the critical exponents including a rather strange quantum critical point of the infinite order with diverging critical exponents .    before concluding , let us make few remarks on a critical behavior of another particular case of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the quartic ising interactions @xmath139 .",
    "this particular case differs from the previous one just in a nature of the quartic ising interactions , which are of equal relative strengths but of different signs . in this respect ,",
    "the positive quartic interaction will prefer spin alignments with either zero or two opposite spins among the four spins ( two ising and two heisenberg ) involved therein , while the negative quartic interaction will favour spin alignments with just one unaligned spin among them .",
    "interestingly , the phase diagrams of this particular case will be essentially identical with the ones discussed previously , since there is a simple relation between the effective boltzmann s weights of both particular cases . as a matter of fact",
    ", it directly follows from eqs .",
    "( [ bw1])-([bw7 ] ) that the effective boltzmann s weights of the model with two non - uniform quartic interactions @xmath139 can be expressed through the boltzmann s weights ( [ bwxxz ] ) of the uniform case as @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "it is quite apparent that the role of different boltzmann s weights is merely interchanged and the greatest boltzmann s weight is now being either @xmath143 or @xmath144",
    ". however , this fact does not affect the ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams because the critical condition ( [ cc ] ) is quite symmetric with respect to all four boltzmann s weights involved therein .",
    "hence , it follows that the zero- and finite - temperature phase diagrams shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] remain valid and one should only perform a respective change of the ising spin configurations from @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively . the ground - state phase diagram of the ferromagnetic ( @xmath86 ) model with the non - uniform quartic interactions , which is shown in fig",

    "namely , the changes of the critical exponents depend through the set of eqs .",
    "( [ ce ] ) on the parameter @xmath44 , which is not symmetric with respect to all four boltzmann s weights .",
    "therefore , it might be quite interesting to ascertain how the critical exponents change by assuming two quartic interactions of different sign ( nature ) .",

    "besides , the critical exponent @xmath124 evidently acquires positive values from the interval @xmath162 , which indicates discontinuous nature of the phase transitions ( @xmath163 ) along the whole critical line of the ferromagnetic model with the non - uniform quartic interactions .    for completeness",

    "it is noteworthy that the precisely opposite trends were observed in the former particular case with the uniform quartic interactions and there are only two common features of both particular cases with the antiferromagnetic pair interaction @xmath87 .",
    "first , the changes of the critical exponent @xmath124 are restricted just to a rather narrow finite interval and second , the same asymptotic value @xmath166 is achieved in the limit @xmath123 .",
    "altogether , it could be concluded that the ising - heisenberg model with the non - uniform quartic interactions generally exhibits a discontinuous phase transitions of the order @xmath167 no matter whether the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic nature of the heisenberg pair interaction @xmath168 is assumed .",
    "in the present work , we have furnished proof of an exact mapping equivalence between the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on a two - dimensional lattice of edge - sharing octahedrons and the zero - field eight - vertex model on a square lattice . in accordance with this exact mapping correspondence , the critical behavior of the model under investigation closely resembles an outstanding critical behavior of the zero - field eight - vertex model and ashkin - teller model @xcite , which exhibit critical lines with continuously varying critical exponents satisfying the weak universality hypothesis @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark , moreover , that the similar precise mapping relationship between the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on a square - hexagon lattice and the zero - field eight - vertex model was recently found by valverde _",
    "et al_. in a restricted region of the interaction parameters @xcite . unlike this case",
    ", the exact mapping correspondence with the zero - field eight - vertex model holds in our case quite generally , i.e. it is not restricted to any particular subvariety of the parameter space .",
    "exact results for the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the pair xyz heisenberg and quartic ising interactions imply that the model with the antiferromagnetic pair interaction surprisingly exhibits less significant changes of both critical temperatures as well as critical exponents than the model with the ferromagnetic pair interaction .",
    "the most interesting finding to emerge from the present study is however an exact evidence of a quantum critical point of the infinite order , which characterizes a peculiar singular behavior of the critical exponents in a close vicinity of the isotropic limit of the heisenberg pair interaction .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the critical exponents vary continuously over the entire range of allowed values by changing the exchange anisotropy in the heisenberg pair interaction and the relative strength of the quartic interaction .",
    "from this point of view , the investigated ising - heisenberg model represents a rare example of the exactly solved quantum spin model with such an unusual weak - universal critical behavior .",
    "next , it is worth noticing that the ising - heisenberg model with the pair heisenberg and quadratic ising interactions can also be interpreted as an interesting example of the exactly solved quantum dimer system with a rather complicated even - body interactions between dimers .",
    "this means that the system of quantum dimers in some specific fluctuations or fields is also equivalent with the exactly solved zero - field eight - vertex model , which contradicts the standard universality hypothesis in that its critical exponents vary continuously with the interaction parameters . in addition , the quartic and other even - body interactions turned out to play an important role in determining magnetic properties of several insulating magnetic materials @xcite , which makes the presented exact results more interesting also from the experimental point of view . even though it would be rather striking coincidence",
    "if some real magnetic material would obey very specific topological requirements of the model under investigation , it is quite reasonable to suspect that our exact results might at least shed light on some important aspects of the critical behavior of real magnetic materials .",
    "last but not least , it should be mentioned that it could be quite interesting to explore also temperature variations of some basic thermodynamic quantities ( such as entropy , specific heat , etc . ) that might exhibit a rather spectacular thermal dependences especially near the zero - temperature phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , several interesting extensions and generalizations of the present version of the ising - heisenberg model come into question besides the most obvious ones mentioned at the end of section [ sec2 ] . for instance",
    ", it is possible to extend the present ising - heisenberg model by including higher - order triplet , quintuplet , and sextuplet interactions between the ising and heisenberg spins , or to solve exactly the analogous ising - heisenberg model with the heisenberg spins @xmath169 that accounts for another interaction terms like the single - ion anisotropy and the biquadratic interaction . in this direction",
