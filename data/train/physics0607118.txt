    "the effect of time dependent fields on magnetization state is important for the reading and writing of information and the monitoring of the magnetization in a magnetic material . in the case of magnetic recording , when density is increased , the grain size making the recording media decreases .",
    "if it is small enough , its magnetization becomes extremely sensitive to thermal energy ; it can flip ( in the vertical case ) or reverse ( in the horizontal case ) by the simple effect of ( even small ) finite temperature perturbation ( brownian fluctuations ) .",
    "this adverse effect is called super - paramagnetism that traditionally limits longitudinal recording of hard disks to densities on the order of 100 gbits / in@xmath0 .",
    "longitudinal refers to the fact the rotation velocity of the disk is parallel to the magnetization orientation . in",
    "perpendicular recording this limit is ten times higher around several tbits / in@xmath0 . + progress in size reduction toward the nanometer paves the way to new opportunities in the emerging field of spintronics @xcite . on that scale",
    ", we have a wide panel of physical effects ( e.g. new types of quantum exchange between nanometer thick magnetic layers ) and the spin diffusion length becomes long enough to maintain useful spin orientation .",
    "novel nanometric magnetic devices are good candidates for use as building blocks of spintronics ( spin diode or spin transistor ) or quantum information systems . the latter span quantum information storage ( q - bits ) , quantum computing ( quantum logic operations like the square root of the @xmath1 operation ( @xmath2 ) or the controlled @xmath1 operation ( @xmath3 ) , the quantum fast fourier transform ... ) , quantum communication systems ( an example is entanglement which means that measurement performed on one system seems to be instantaneously influencing other systems related to it ) or quantum metrology . + it is important to be able to tell how one might be able to alter some state with a magnetic field , or how it might be affected by temperature as in the recording case .",
    "it is important to point out that interesting quantum phenomena might occur at low temperatures ( @xmath4 ) such as magnetic quantum tunneling ; while this is beyond the scope of this paper , the reader might consult a review such as ref .",
    "+ the time it takes for an effect to take place is also important . in recording , given a fixed rotational velocity of the hard disk ( typically 7200 rpm ) the decrease of bit length , imposes a faster ( higher frequency ) process of reading ( sensing the magnetization orientation)/writing ( changing the magnetization orientation ) of the bit . while the shortest time altering the magnetization is required in reading / writing applications , the longest time is required in ( long - term ) storage with protection of the data against large magnetic fields that might corrupt or even erase the stored information .",
    "+ in this paper corresponding to the second part of the series on the stoner - wohlfarth model , we examine the effects of time dependent field and finite temperature on a single domain stoner particle @xcite . the time it takes for the magnetization to change is also studied with temperature and material parameters . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we examine the evolution of magnetization state with a time dependent field . in section 3",
    "we discuss the effect of temperature on magnetization reversal and we conclude in section 4 with the possible extensions and perspectives of the sw model .",
    "magnetization dynamics is governed by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation .",

    "is accounted for by a coefficient @xmath10 and introduced a dissipation non - linear term of the form @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the modulus of @xmath5 ) controlled by the effective magnetic field @xmath9 :    @xmath13",
    "l - l define , as in quantum field theory , the effective field @xmath9 from the functional derivative of the total energy with respect to magnetization @xmath14 ; hence in any magnetic problem the total energy should be the starting point whether one is dealing with static or dynamical problems . in the simple stoner particle case , the functional derivative reduces to the gradient with respect to @xmath5 , @xmath15 .    in order to avoid the divergence problem arising in the l - l equation for the large dissipation case ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "gilbert modified the l - l dissipation term by introducing a damping term of the form @xmath17 .",
    "the equation of motion of a magnetic moment in presence of damping and effective field is given by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( l - l - g ) equation :    @xmath18    where @xmath5 is the magnetization vector , @xmath9 the effective field , @xmath19 another gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath20 the damping parameter .",
    "first of all , we retrieve bloch equation in the simple case of zero damping and effective field @xmath21 the externally applied field . in the static case",
    ", the l - l - g equation reduces to @xmath22 meaning the static equilibrium condition is either @xmath23 or @xmath24 equivalent to the extremum ( minimum ) condition on the energy as discussed previously ( see first part of this work ) .",

    "one gets @xmath26 meaning that @xmath27 constant , where @xmath28 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "+ the l - l - g equation seems odd from the mathematical point of view since one is used ( in systems of ordinary differential equations or ode ) to see the first derivative term @xmath29 in the lhs only .",
    "here it appears on both sides and pushes one to think that the system can not be handled by standard mathematical integration tools like euler or runge - kutta methods .",
    "+ in addition , it is misleading to attempt at solving recursively the l - l - g equation by substituting repeatedly the term @xmath30 in the rhs of the equation .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the landau - lifshitz ( l - l ) equation is mathematically equivalent to the l - l - g equation by taking the cross product of the lhs of eq .",

    "+ in addition , the l - l dissipation term goes to zero when the damping coefficient goes to infinity making the l - l - g equation appear more physically appealing than the l - l equation .    the system of ode eqs .",

    "undesirable ringing effects ( oscillations ) in the time variation of @xmath45 are observed .",
    "they are so because they introduce an unwanted delay in magnetization reversal .    in order to eliminate the ringing effect",
    ", we move on to another reversal mode called precession switching in which the field is applied perpendicularly to the initial magnetization and whose action is on until the magnetization is reversed without displaying any ringing effect . the reversal path on the unit sphere is called a ballistic path ( see fig .",

    "the sensitivity of this process stems from the fact , the field must be switched off exactly at the time magnetization reverses ( see fig.[mz_bal ] ) .",
    "a grain at finite temperature is prone to thermal excitations that might alter its magnetization state .",
    "the simplest model describing the effect of temperature on a grain is inspired from chemistry and is called the nel - arrhenius thermal excitation model .",

    "the empirical arrhenius model is used to describe the kinetics of a thermally activated process .",
    "this assumes that an energy barrier hinders the forward progress of a chemical reaction .",

    "forward progress of the reaction requires the supply of an activation energy to surmount this barrier .",

    "the number of particles that decay in the instant @xmath53 $ ] is @xmath54 . integrating with the initial condition @xmath55 we find that the particles that are still present ( did not decay or switch ) is given by @xmath56 .",
    "this analogy holds if switching is treated as an irreversible process like decay .",
    "this means , switching back to the original value is not considered as a valid process .",
    "this is the case of data recording : if the stored value has changed once , it is no longer valid and must be rejected .",
    "+ since the average lifetime is given by @xmath57 we interpret the inverse rate as the average lifetime with respect to switching .",
    "this means that the recorded information in a magnetic material ( tape , hard disk , floppy etc ... ) stays unaltered for a period of time given by @xmath47 .",
    "we infer from this analogy that the probability of switching is given by @xmath58 and therefore the probability of retaining the information ( not switching ) is given by the complementary probability : @xmath59 with the new interpretation of arrhenius formula @xmath60 .",
    "this decay picture of switching can be recast in a two - level model since switching means we have a transition from a magnetization state ( 1 ) to another ( 2 ) as depicted in fig .",

    "* we have a super - paramagnetic state in the opposite case @xmath74 leading to @xmath75 .",
    "physically , @xmath76 is of the order of the experimental measurement time and a blocked state means that no change to the system is observed during @xmath76 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the instrinsic time @xmath74 , the magnetization change is so frequent that no well defined state is maintained for a long enough time .",
    "thus the system behaves like a paramagnetic system that can not store information ( in a stable and reliable way ) .",
    "hence the origin of the `` super - paramagnetic '' qualifier .    when a grain switches we have information storage errors and the bit error rate ( ber ) is given by the switching probability @xmath58 .",
    "in order to appreciate the meaning of ber and therefore average lifetime and barrier height , suppose we impose a ber of 10@xmath77 .",

    "if the change of orientation is fast with respect to our appreciation of the hysteresis loop , then we observe an overall mean behaviour stemming from an average hysteresis loop .",
    "this average hysteresis loop can be calculated with several methods . in ensemble averaging , one considers a single grain in many orientational configurations that is making different angles with the magnetic field ( taken along the z - direction ) . with time",

    "we perform the averaging in 3d following the original work of stoner - wohlfarth despite the fact our previous description was intentionally limited to 2d .    taking the anisotropy axis along the grain long axis with polar angle @xmath37 and azimuthal angle @xmath83 ( see fig .
