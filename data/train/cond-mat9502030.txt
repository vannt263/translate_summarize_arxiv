    "metallic superlattice systems consisting of alternating layers of superconducting and normal films have attracted wide interest , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",

    "landau theory can be employed [ 27 ] , but away from this point other approaches such as the constant pair amplitude approximation [ 815 ] , a `` cooper '' proximity effect argument @xcite , the tunneling model of mcmillan @xcite , a wkb approximation @xcite , or a semi ",
    "classical approximation @xcite can be used .",
    "implicit in these approaches when applied to superlattices is the argument that , from symmetry considerations , the form of the pair amplitude of the cooper pairs for a bilayer is the same as that for a superlattice consisting of an infinite number of adjoining bilayers . while true for an infinite superlattice , experimentally these systems are of a finite extent , and one",
    "could then question the reasonableness of the bilayer assumption for finite systems .",
    "this issue could also arise in the general context of the applicability of bloch s theorem for periodic potentials in cases of large but finite ",
    "sized systems , as for instance as applied to the kronig  penney model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will address some aspects of this question of how many bilayers are effectively needed to have an infinite superlattice system , particularly as related to how the critical temperature of such systems is affected .",

    "we argue from the calculated form of the pair amplitude that the approximation of a constant pair potential is reasonable in two distinct cases : for thick superconducting films over a wide range of thicknesses of the normal film , and for thin superconducting and normal films . as related to finding the critical temperature in this approach , in the first case a relatively small number of layers",

    "vi contains some concluding remarks .",
    "we first study the case of a single superconducting film embedded in a normal metal @xcite .",
    "the film , of width @xmath0 , is centered at the origin @xmath1 , as in fig .  1 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system in terms of the electron wave function @xmath2 is given in the mean field approximation by @xmath3\\tau_3\\phi({\\bf r } )    \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\int d^3r\\,g(x ) f(x ) \\phi^{\\dag}({\\bf r})\\tau_1\\phi({\\bf r } ) , \\label{singleham } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are the pauli matrices , @xmath5 is the pair amplitude , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the spatially inhomogeneous bcs coupling constant .",
    "we assume the superconducting and normal metals are clean and have the same effective electron masses , fermi velocities , debye temperatures , etc .    the nambu doublet is then decomposed as @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and `` @xmath11 '' labels the particular linearly independent solution present .",
    "if we now introduce @xmath12 where @xmath13 , then assuming @xmath14 to be smooth on the atomic scale results in the bogoliubov equation following from eq.([singleham ] ) : @xmath15 the corresponding wave function @xmath16 can then be readily obtained .    the non  linearity introduced by @xmath17 makes eq.([bogeq ] ) difficult to solve for inhomogeneous geometries . to obtain a simple solution we therefore make the approximation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant .",
    "the solutions to eq.([bogeq ] ) under this approximation are readily found to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 the coefficients of the wave function entering into the solutions of eq.([solutions ] ) can be determined by imposing continuity at the interface @xmath22 together with the normalization conditions @xmath23    thus far these solutions contain the free parameter @xmath19 .",
    "we fix this parameter by requiring that it minimize the free energy of the system : @xmath24 where the angular brackets denote the thermal average . using eq.([singleham ] ) we find that this condition translates into the self  consistent gap equation @xmath25 in other words , we demand that the spatial average of the calculated pair amplitude be equal to the constant @xmath19 assumed in finding the solution .    in the limit @xmath26 the gap equation ( [ gap ] )",
    "will determine the critical temperature @xmath27 as a function of the thickness @xmath28 of the superconducting film . using the solutions and",
    "boundary conditions discussed previously , we find this equation becomes , assuming @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the density of states of one spin projection at the fermi surface and , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the function @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the cosine and sine integrals defined as @xcite @xmath39 and @xmath40 is euler s constant .",
    "the function @xmath41 of eq.([hofx ] ) has the following limiting forms : @xmath42    for comparison with other geometries the numerical solution to eq.([critsingtemp ] ) giving the critical temperature @xmath27 will be discussed in sec .",
    "now we only note that eq.([critsingtemp ] ) can be solved analytically in the zero temperature limit , which gives the critical thickness @xmath43 below which superconductivity can not be maintained at any temperature : @xmath44 .",
    "one finds , assuming @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the bulk critical temperature and @xmath48 is the bulk coherence length .",
    "this value of the critical thickness compares favourably with that found using other approaches @xcite , and will be used in subsequent sections as a convenient length scale when discussing other geometries .",
    "it is also useful for later comparisons with other geometries to introduce @xmath43 directly into the gap equation of eq.([critsingtemp ] ) ; doing so leads to the following equivalent forms : @xmath49=i(\\tau),\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ln\\left[\\frac{t_c}{t_c(a)}\\right]=\\frac{\\pi}{8\\tau}+\\frac{1}{2}k(\\tau ) , \\label{critsing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50,\\nonumber\\\\ & & k(x)=\\int_{1}^{\\infty}dt\\left[1-\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right ] \\ln\\tanh\\left[\\frac{\\pi x t}{2}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the feature of these and the following gap equations that the thicknesses of the superconducting and normal layers scale with @xmath43 makes it possible that dirty materials might also be described within the present framework by a simple reinterpretation of @xmath43 , as was found in the single layer case by a comparison with the tunneling model @xcite .",
    "we next study an infinite superlattice consisting of alternating superconducting films of width @xmath0 separated by normal films of width @xmath51 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . using the approach of the previous section ,",
    "we first consider @xmath52 such films and eventually take @xmath53 .",
    "we assume the pair potential @xmath54 in each superconducting layer is a constant @xmath19 and vanishes in each normal layer .",
    "this allows us to solve the corresponding bogoliubov equations ( [ bogeq ] ) in each region subject to the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is then determined by the minimization of the free energy of the system .",
    "this condition , in the limit @xmath26 , gives the critical temperature @xmath55 as a function of the thicknesses @xmath28 and @xmath56 of the films .",
    "taking the limit @xmath53 then results in the gap equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 appear in eq.([tau ] ) , and @xmath61 \\ln\\cosh(t / x).\\ ] ]    for infinite @xmath56 the function @xmath62 vanishes , resulting in the gap equation of eq.([critsing ] ) for the single layer . @xmath62",
    "thus represents coherence effects the other layers introduce to the single film geometry .",
    "eq.([gapinf ] ) agrees with the results of an analysis directly incorporating bloch s theorem in this context for periodic systems @xcite .",
    "we present in the next section the numerical solution to eq.([gapinf ] ) in various cases and compare these results with those corresponding to a finite number of layers using this same general approach .",
    "in this section we examine by these methods a `` superlattice '' with a finite number of layers . as with the true infinite superlattice",
    "this consists of alternating superconducting films of width @xmath0 separated by normal films of width @xmath51 , as in fig .  2 , but now after the last superconducting layer on each end we assume a normal metal fills the remainder of space .",
    "we again assume the pair potential @xmath54 in each superconducting layer is a constant , but unlike the infinite superlattice there is no reason _ a priori _ to assume the same constant in each layer .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath54 is some constant @xmath63 for the @xmath64 superconducting layer , and as before vanishes in each normal layer .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . with appropriate boundary conditions",
    "the bogoliubov equations ( [ bogeq ] ) are readily solved , and the parameters @xmath63 are again determined by the minimization of the free energy of the system .",
    "this again translates into equating the spatial average of the calculated pair potential in the @xmath64 layer to the assumed constant @xmath63 .",
    "these conditions now are a coupled set of @xmath65 equations , which in the limit @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by @xmath68=-\\frac{\\pi}{16\\tau } \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{4}\\left\\{k(\\tau)-2jy k(2jy\\tau)+(1 + 2jy)k[(1 + 2jy)\\tau]\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{l = j+1}^{n}\\frac{\\delta_l}{\\delta_j } \\left\\ { 2(l+j)yk[(l+j)y\\tau ] + 2(l - j)yk[(l - j)y\\tau ] \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & -[1+(l+j)y]k[1+(l+j)y\\tau ] -[1+(l - j)y]k[1+(l - j)y\\tau]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.-[-1+(l+j)y]k[-1+(l+j)y\\tau ] -[-1+(l - j)y]k[-1+(l - j)y\\tau]\\right\\ } , \\label{critfin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath59 and @xmath71 appear in eq.([tau ] ) . as a check , if we consider the single layer limit with @xmath72 , then the system of equations ( [ critfin ] ) reduces to a single equation , which agrees with the gap equation ( [ critsing ] ) derived before .",
    "we first consider the @xmath73 equation of the set ( [ critfin ] ) , for which the term involving the summation over @xmath74 does not contribute .",
    "this equation will determine the critical temperature @xmath75 as a function of the thicknesses @xmath28 and @xmath56 of the films and of the number of superconducting layers present , @xmath76 . in figs .  4 and 5 we present the numerical solution to this equation for different values of @xmath56 and @xmath52 , along with the results for the infinite superlattice of eq.([gapinf ] ) and for the single layer of eq.([critsing ] ) .",
    "although for all values of @xmath56 and @xmath52 the correct bulk limit as @xmath77 is reached , quantitative differences with the infinite superlattice are obtained for smaller values of @xmath78 for the finite lattice .",
    "in particular , as @xmath79 increases in the finite lattice the curves do not approach that of the single layer case , as might be expected and is found for the infinite superlattice .    before concluding anything from these results , however , let us examine the other equations of the set ( [ critfin ] )",
    ". for @xmath80 these equations involve the term containing the summation over @xmath74 , and can be used to express , for example , @xmath81 in terms of the value of the center layer , @xmath82 . in figs .",
    "69 we present the numerical solution to these equations at zero temperature for some representative values of @xmath79 and @xmath52 .",
    "we would expect that as one moved out from the central region the superconductivity would become weaker in some sense , which would translate into decreasing values of the ratio @xmath83 as @xmath84 increases .",
    "this expectation is borne out for smaller values of @xmath79 for a large range of @xmath52 , but not for larger values of @xmath79 . at finite temperature ,",
    "illustrated in figs .",
    "10 and 11 , the expected behaviour is again found for smaller values of @xmath79 but not completely for the larger values , although the situation improves as the temperature increases .",
    "what one might conclude from this analysis is that the method used in this context seems reliable for thin normal films over a wide range of thicknesses of the superconducting layers , but for thicker normal films the method seems reasonable only for thicker superconducting layers ( i.  e. , larger critical temperatures ) .",
    "this could indicate that the approximation of a constant pair potential in the superconducting layer appears reasonable in this range of validity , for which little spatial variation in the true potential might be expected .    with the preceding discussion in mind we now return to a comparison of the finite superlattice results of the critical temperature in figs .  4 and 5 with that of the infinite superlattice",
    "we restrict this comparison to a potentially large but still finite number of layers in the finite system , as in the limit @xmath53 our initial assumption of the independence of the gap parameters @xmath63 in each layer will no longer be valid . given this , for thicker superconducting layers ( @xmath85 ) , where the approximation of a constant pair potential seems reasonable over a wide range of thicknesses @xmath79 of the normal layer",
    ", we could conclude for these methods that a finite superlattice approximates well an infinite superlattice for a reasonably small number of layers ( @xmath86 ) . on the other hand , for thinner superconducting layers ( @xmath87 )",
    ", the approximation of a constant pair potential seems reasonable only for thin normal layers ( @xmath88 ) . in this range",
    "we could conclude that there are noticeable differences between the finite lattice and the infinite superlattice in this approach , as seen from fig .  4 , even with a relatively large number of layers for the finite system .",
    "qualitatively what is found is that , for a given thickness @xmath78 , the corresponding critical temperature in the finite lattice is smaller compared to the case of the infinite superlattice .",
    "this feature could be understood in terms of the form of the pair potential suggested by fig .  3 and found in figs .  6 , 7 , 10 , and 11 , where the gap parameters decrease relative to the central value as one moves towards the edges",
    "if one assumes this gap parameter ratio measures in a way the relative strength of the binding of the cooper pairs in each region , then from this one might infer that the superconductivity is in a sense `` weaker '' towards the edges for the finite potential of fig .  3 compared to the case of the same constant gap parameter assumed over each superconducting region in an infinite superlattice , as in fig .  2 .",
    "thermal excitations would then more readily break superconductivity in these outer regions , leading to a lower critical temperature for a given thickness @xmath78 in the finite lattice compared to the infinite superlattice .",
    "such a tendency of weaker superconductivity in the finite lattice continues to hold except as the thickness of the superconducting layer decreases further ( @xmath89 ) ; in the extreme limit this is a reflection of the fact that the approximation @xmath90 used in deriving eq.([critfin ] ) is breaking down .",
    "the results of the last section raised questions concerning the appropriateness of the assumption of a constant pair amplitude in a superconducting layer . in this section",
    "we will attempt to improve on this assumption for the case of the single layer described in sec .",
    "specifically , we imagine for the situation of @xmath76 layers in fig .",
    "2 letting the width @xmath56 of the normal layer approach zero . in effect",
    "we have then artificially divided a superconducting single layer of width @xmath91 , as in fig .",
    "12 , into @xmath76 layers , each of width @xmath0 . as in the last section",
    "we next assume the gap parameter in each layer is some constant @xmath63 , and then set up and solve the system of self - consistent gap equations found by a minimization of the free energy .",
    "this again leads to a coupled set of equations , and as in the previous section the @xmath92 equation for the layer on the extreme edge will determine the transition temperature as a function of the film thickness @xmath28 and the number of layers @xmath52 .",

    "we first consider the zero temperature case , by which this limiting procedure will yield the critical thickness @xmath99 in this model below which superconductivity can not be maintained at any temperature .",

    "ii , where the pair potential was assumed to be constant over the entire superconducting layer . as well , eq.([enhanced ] ) reinforces the trend that the critical thickness would be larger for weaker bcs superconductors with smaller values of @xmath101 , as one might expect .    as with the case of thin normal and superconducting layers of the finite lattice in the last section",
    ", these features of the critical thickness can be interpreted in terms of the form of the pair potential suggested by fig .",
    "12 , where the gap parameters decrease relative to the central value as one moves towards the edges . from this",
    "one might infer that the superconductivity is in a sense `` weaker '' towards the edges for such a potential compared to the case of a constant gap parameter assumed over the entire superconducting region , as in fig",
    "if one pictures the breaking of superconductivity as the `` leaking '' of cooper pairs into the normal region , then one would expect that the form of the more `` realistic '' pair potential in fig .",
    "14 would lead to an earlier destruction of superconductivity compared to the constant pair potential of fig .  1 .",
    "one can also analyze the gap equation ( [ singimp ] ) at finite temperature .",
    "for example , in the vicinity of zero temperature one finds @xmath104.\\ ] ] however , at higher temperatures this method of analyzing the single layer case fails , and in particular gives the wrong bulk limit as @xmath105 .",
    "this would indicate the assumption in this model of a constant pair amplitude for thick initial superconducting film layers is invalid .",
    "we have considered the question of when a finite sized system composed of alternating layers of superconducting and normal metals can effectively be thought of as a true infinite superlattice .",
    "concentrating on the calculation of the critical temperature , we extended some methods used previously for a single superconducting layer and an infinite superlattice to such finite  sized systems . by examining the form of the pair potential",
    "found we argued that the approximation of a constant cooper pair potential in each superconducting region seems reasonable for thick superconducting films ( @xmath85 ) over a wide range of thicknesses of the normal films or else for thin superconducting ( @xmath87 ) and thin normal ( @xmath88 ) films .",
    "the results suggest that for thick superconducting films it takes a relatively small number of layers ( @xmath86 ) using these methods to effectively make an infinite superlattice .",
    "however , for thin superconducting and normal films noticeable differences were found in this approach between the finite and infinite superlattices , even for a relatively large number of layers for the finite lattice .",
    "the corresponding decrease in the critical temperature of the finite lattice at a fixed thickness of the superconducting layer was attributed to the `` weaker '' superconductivity in the outer regions compared to the case of the constant pair potential assumption of the infinite superlattice .",
    "one might argue that such `` weaker '' zones in finite but large systems would be true for more realistic forms of the pair amplitude incorporating some spatial variation .",
    "we also applied these methods in the case of a single superconducting layer to construct a model which attempts to incorporate a more realistic form of the pair potential than the assumed constant .",
    "the model suggested that the zero temperature critical thickness will be enhanced with such a pair potential compared to that found by assuming a constant pair potential , and also exhibited the trend that weaker bcs superconductors will have a larger value of this thickness .",

    "<S> clean metallic superlattice systems composed of alternating layers of superconducting and normal materials are considered , particularly aspects of the proximity effect as it affects the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a simple model is used to address the question of when a finite  sized system theoretically approximates well a true infinite superlattice . </S>",
    "<S> the methods used in the analysis afford some tests of the approximation used that the pair amplitude of the cooper pairs is constant over a superconducting region . </S>",
    "<S> we also use these methods to construct a model of a single superconducting layer which intends to incorporate a more realistic form of the pair amplitude than a simple constant . </S>"
