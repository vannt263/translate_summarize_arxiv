    "the potential consists of a spin - independent part @xmath12 of hexagonal symmetry and a state - dependent super - lattice emerging from the local pseudo - magnetic field @xmath13 . according to the local polarization",

    "atoms with @xmath19 are preferably confined to either the @xmath1 or the @xmath2 triangular lattice structure .",
    "in contrast , atoms in the @xmath20 state will distribute homogeneously over both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lattices ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) . for convenience",
    ", we refer to these different configurations as _ triangular _",
    "( @xmath19 ) and _ hexagonal _ states ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this spin - dependent spatial distribution determines the structure factor of the lattice , which in turn determines the quasi - momentum distribution of the atoms .",
    "we experimentally observe this difference in the structure factors by mapping the quasi - momentum spectrum to the spatial density distribution of the ensemble via time - of - flight images .",
    "typical results for _ triangular _ and _ hexagonal _ initial states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c together with the corresponding theoretical prediction from a one - particle band structure calculation .",
    "the observed second- to first - order interference peak ratio ( see fig .  [",
    "fig:1]c bottom ) is significantly larger for the _ hexagonal _ states as compared to",
    "_ triangular _ configurations .",
    "it typically ranges between two and four for our experimental parameters , which is well reproduced by calculations of the bloch functions and their quasi - momentum distribution for the corresponding spin - dependent lattice geometry .",
    "to obtain a detailed understanding of the rich physics arising from different lattice occupations we have developed a novel method for state- and site - selective microwave spectroscopy .",
    "it allows for _ in - situ _ investigations of the spatial spin - ordering in the hexagonal and triangular lattice structures .",
    "it is suitable for studying different regimes ranging from the superfluid to the mott - insulating phase .",
    "previously , a different kind of polarization - dependent radio - frequency spectroscopy method was used to study cubic lattices@xcite .",
    "our method is based on the spatially varying transition frequencies between populated @xmath3-states to initially non - occupied @xmath21-states .",
    "the potential energy difference between the initial and the final state is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an additionally applied homogeneous magnetic guiding field and @xmath24 is the @xmath16rb - hyperfine splitting .",
    "the spectroscopy signal is obtained by detecting and normalizing the number of atoms in the respective @xmath3- and @xmath21-states after applying a microwave pulse , then releasing the sample from the lattice and performing stern - gerlach separation . in the following we discuss central results of the microwave spectroscopy method , first for single component samples , then for spin - mixtures .",
    "typical data for both scenarios is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : microwavespectroscopy ] . + the spatial variation of the differential potential shift @xmath25 vanishes for transitions with @xmath26 .",

    ", the left ( right ) transition peak refers to the transition from the first band of the _ hexagonal _ state @xmath29 to the first ( second ) band of the _ triangular _ state @xmath31 where the atoms are mostly confined to the @xmath33 sites .",
    "we measure the two transition frequencies @xmath34khz and @xmath35khz , where @xmath36 is the resonance frequency without 2d - lattice .",
    "we find excellent agreement with the theoretical expectations of @xmath37khz and @xmath38khz obtained using an _ ab initio _ single - particle 2d band - structure calculation .",
    "note that for the hexagonal lattice the bloch functions do not separate like it is the case for cubic lattice .",
    "+ moreover , we compare the particle transfer efficiencies of the two transitions with the calculated predictions .",
    "experimentally , the transfer efficiencies are determined evaluating the integrals of the corresponding transition peaks . for the measurement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : microwavespectroscopy]c we measure the transfer efficiency of the @xmath39-transition to be @xmath40 times larger than for the @xmath41-transition .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the calculated ratio of the franck - condon overlaps between the initial state and the two final states resulting in a @xmath42 times larger transfer efficiency for the @xmath39-transition .",
    "it also confirms the expected homogeneous density distribution of @xmath43 atoms at @xmath1 and @xmath2 sites .",
    "therefore the spectroscopy allows to measure the relative occupations of the two sublattices @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it can equally well be applied to study other initial spin - states e.g.  a state of @xmath44 atoms .",
    "figures [ fig : microwavespectroscopy]b and e show the @xmath44 to @xmath28 transition amplitudes for different lattice depths and clearly reveal the exclusive occupation of the @xmath2 sites for sufficiently deep lattices . for shallow lattices ,",
    "the microwave transition frequency coincides with the one for a vanishing lattice potential .",
    "a crossover can be observed at intermediate lattice depths .",
    "the observed shift of @xmath45 for deeper lattices is reproduced by calculations within a harmonic approximation , whereas the signals for shallow and intermediate lattices can not easily be explained in the single - site approximation .",
    "when initializing the atoms in @xmath46 , we observe the equivalent signals corresponding to the occupation of the @xmath1 sites and thus demonstrate the ability to actively force the generation of a magnetically ordered nel state with predefined magnetization by using a mixture of different spin - states , e.g. , @xmath44 with @xmath46 .",
    "+ the experimental setup allows for the preparation of arbitrary spin - mixtures in the spin - dependent optical lattice .",
    "the interplay of the interaction between different spin - states and the lattice potential has a crucial impact on the static and dynamic properties of the system .",
    "particularly interesting is the case of a mixture of @xmath29 and @xmath44 atoms . while the @xmath44 atoms tend to localize in the @xmath2 sites , the @xmath29 atoms fill the hexagonal lattice homogeneously as it was shown above for pure atomic samples ( figs .",
    "[ fig : microwavespectroscopy]a - c , e ) . in case of a mixture of these spin - components , the additional repulsive _",
    "inter-_species interaction causes the @xmath44 atoms to imprint a periodic density modulation on the @xmath29 atoms .",
    "experimentally we observe an almost vanishing transition amplitude of the peak corresponding to the @xmath2 sites as shown in figure [ fig : microwavespectroscopy]d .",
    "comparison of the integrated overall transition probability with the one obtained for pure systems indicate that ( @xmath47)% of the @xmath20 atoms , initially sitting at @xmath2 sites , have been transferred to @xmath1 sites .",
    "this crystalline order imprinted onto the @xmath29 atoms by the @xmath44 atoms can appear in two different scenarios : first , when the @xmath29 atoms are localized on the @xmath1 sites , the system forms an alternating mott - insulator . in this case , the mixture resembles a localized alternating spin - ordering .",
    "second , when the @xmath29 atoms are still superfluid the system shows an off - diagonal long - range order .",
    "together with the spatial modulation due to the interaction with the other spin - component , this indicates a supersolid like behavior@xcite . by varying the depth of the lattice both scenarios have been realized and indeed , we experimentally observe that the @xmath29 atoms were driven across the superfluid - to - mott - insulator transition referring to both cases .     and * b * ) absolute value of the superfluid order parameter @xmath48 of @xmath29 atoms .",
    "two different ensembles are considered ; a pure ensemble of @xmath29 atoms ( blue line ) and a 50:50 mixture with additional @xmath44 atoms ( black lines ) .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) black line is the value at @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) sites . in a pure system the values are identical at @xmath1 and @xmath2 sites ( blue line ) .",

    "[ fig : ss ] we demonstrate that an equal mixture of @xmath29 and @xmath44 atoms results in a _ forced supersolid_. this is shown with the aid of the absolute value of the superfluid order parameter @xmath49 ( top ) and the occupation number @xmath50 ( bottom ) of the @xmath29 state at @xmath1 and @xmath2 sites assuming a filling of two particles per unit cell . for comparison",
    ", we also include the calculations for a pure @xmath29 system . here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 as well as @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "coincide for all @xmath55 revealing the expected homogeneous atom distribution within the lattice .",
    "this changes when @xmath44 atoms are admixed to the @xmath29 atoms . at already moderate lattice depths",
    "the @xmath44 particles are localized at the @xmath2 sites . as a consequence",
    "the @xmath29 component is repelled from these sites and the corresponding occupation number and superfluid order parameter become spatially modulated , which is characteristic for a supersolid .",
    "moreover , we observe that the effective blocking of @xmath2 sites by @xmath44 particles forces the @xmath29 atoms to undergo the transition to the mott  insulator already at weaker lattice depths than in the pure case .",
    "hence an admixture of a second spin - component allows us to tune the critical point of the sf ",
    "mi transition as well as the spatial density modulation and superfluid order parameter .",
    "transport properties play an important role in understanding , for example , the conductivity of solid - state systems . for the quantum optical counterparts of such systems , the optical lattices ,",
    "these properties are essentially governed by the interplay of the on - site interaction @xmath56 with the the tunnel matrix element @xmath57 and are usually well described by the bose  hubbard model@xcite ( see appendix ) . in optical lattice experiments ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath58 is directly adjustable through the power of the lattice beams allowing to drive the ensemble from the superfluid to the mott - insulating state .",
    "we use the interference pattern contrast ( visibility ) as an indicator for this transition@xcite .",
    "results of such measurements are shown in figure  [ fig:3]a for different single - component samples .",
    "we compare the sf ",
    "mi transition of a _ hexagonal _ state @xmath29 with that of the _ triangular _ states @xmath44 and @xmath59 and observe that the interference contrast curves are considerably shifted with respect to one another .",
    "+ we start by analyzing the situation for the @xmath44 and the @xmath59 states .",
    "as these states experience an additional modulation of the hexagonal potential caused by @xmath60 , resonant tunneling is only possible to the six _ next - nearest neighbor sites _ in the lattice . due to this additional modulation ,",
    "the tunneling barrier between the occupied lattice sites increases with @xmath61 ( compare eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) ) .",
    "the sf  mi transition is thus expected to occur at lower overall beam powers for increasing values of @xmath61 .",
    "however , the two transitions are expected to nearly coincide when both are rescaled to the same modulation depth .",
    "this is confirmed by the data shown in the inset of figure [ fig:3]a , where the interference contrast is plotted as a function of the effective one - dimensional tunneling barrier height . for the @xmath20 states ,",
    "the situation is different : since in this case the optical potential is not additionally modulated , resonant tunneling takes place to the three _",
    "nearest neighbors_. this leads to a strongly increased tunneling probability and therefore higher lattice beam powers are required for the sf ",
    "mi transition to occur .",
    "interestingly , all three transitions nearly coincide when normalized to the height of the barrier , regardless of the effect of different hopping distances and possible number of accessible sites .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained when considering in addition to _",
    "nearest neighbor _ tunneling processes also _ second - nearest neighbor _ processes .",
    "this is confirmed in calculations using the gutzwiller approach .",
    "results of such calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b for the experimental configurations with filling factors ranging between two and four per lattice unit cell .",
    "the numerical results show a good qualitative agreement with the observed experimental data .",
    "+ the fact that the sf  mi transition occurs at different lattice beam intensities for different values of @xmath62 adds an exciting new dimension to our lattice geometry : it opens the possibility to create spin - mixtures where a fully localized component is immersed in a superfluid bath .",
    "experimentally , we study this configuration by loading @xmath44 atoms which preferably occupy the @xmath2 lattice and add to these the more localized state @xmath59 ( @xmath63 ) , which is strongly confined to the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) lattice . as figure  [ fig:3]c shows for the case of a 50:50 mixture , a considerable shift in the sf ",
    "mi transition of the @xmath44 atoms is observed when the admixed atoms occupy @xmath1 sites , i.e. , when they are located in between the preferably occupied @xmath64 sites of @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition remains practically unaltered when the more localized component occupies the same lattice sites as the superfluid core .",
    "the pictograms in figure  [ fig:3]c illustrate these three different cases .",
    "the addition of a spin - crystal thus allows one to tailor the position of the sf  mi transition depending on the sub - lattice it occupies .",
    "+ the gutzwiller computations reproduce the shift of the sf  mi transition ( see figure [ fig:3]d ) .",
    "the observed changes in the tunneling probabilities can be ascribed to a modification of second order hopping processes : second order hopping of @xmath44 between the @xmath2 sites is only possible by passing through sites of the @xmath1 lattice .",
    "however , in a @xmath44 ",
    "@xmath59 mixture , these sites are occupied by @xmath59 atoms .",
    "the interaction energy between the atoms increases the effective barrier and suppresses tunneling .",
    "thus , the sf  mi transition is shifted towards lower lattice laser beam intensities . by changing the relative composition of the mixture , the strength of this tunneling suppression can be modified .",
    "+ further insight into the underlying physical processes is gained by considering the phase diagrams calculated in gutzwiller approximation .",
    "figure [ fig:4]a shows the sf  mi phase diagram for the experimental configurations discussed in figs .  [ fig:3]c and",
    "d. a clear modification of the mott - insulator lobes of a _ triangular _ state can be observed when strongly localized atoms are present in the complementary triangular sublattice(@xmath65 ) .",
    "such a strong modification with respect to the pure case does not occur when both components occupy the same sites ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this perfectly agrees with our experimental observations discussed above . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b we plot the sf ",
    "mi transition for a @xmath67 mixture for different inter - component interaction strengths @xmath68 between @xmath44 and @xmath59 ranging from the experimental value @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "such a situation of e.g.  @xmath69 could be achieved experimentally by tuning the interactions with the help of feshbach resonances@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the standard tendency is inverted in the hard core limit , when different components occupy different sites .",
    "this implies that the sf ",
    "mi transition for higher mott orders occurs in the interesting regime that interpolates between the bose  hubbard regime and an array of coupled rotors , similar to an array of josephson junctions@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of a novel type of optical lattice , which exhibits hexagonal spatial symmetry .",
    "the intriguing polarization structure of the lattice sites can cause a break up of the hexagonal structure for particular spin - states leading to the creation of a triangular , magnetic sublattice .",
    "the nature of this lattice potential , combined with the possibility to precisely control system parameters , makes this system especially suitable for studying new quantum phase mixtures of superfluid and mott - insulating states .",
    "+ we could show that a combined effect of repulsive interaction and the specific hexagonal lattice structure leads to modifications of @xmath58 , which is clearly a different situation compared to e.g.  bose - fermi mixture experiments@xcite where higher order effects effectively modify @xmath57 and @xmath56 . + as promising further directions , entropy effects and entropic cooling @xcite can be studied in the hexagonal system .",
    "particularly interesting , however , is the prospect of studying polarized or unpolarized fermi gases , or fermi  bose mixtures in the hexagonal lattice geometry . at half filling , both of these polarized systems will mimic the physics of graphene@xcite , i.e. , exhibit dirac s dispersion relation , artificial relativistic effects , etc . introducing artificial gauge fields in such situations@xcite will lead to the occurrence of the anomalous quantum hall effect and a whole variety of exotic quantum phase transitions ( see for instance ref .",
    "furthermore , by only changing the polarization of the laser beams creating the lattice , a spin - independent triangular lattice can be created@xcite . a bosonic gas in the triangular lattice",
    "might then be used to mimic frustrated antiferromagnetism by employing a time - dependent lattice modulation @xcite .",
