    "study of the @xmath0-adic cohomology of shimura varieties is an important theme in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry .",
    "let @xmath4 be a shimura variety associated to a shimura datum @xmath5 and a compact open subgroup @xmath6 of @xmath7 .",
    "as is well - known , it is naturally defined over a number field @xmath8 , called the reflex field , which is canonically attached to @xmath5 .",
    "first of all , let us consider the case where our shimura variety is compact ; namely , @xmath9 is proper over @xmath8 . for an irreducible algebraic representation @xmath10 of @xmath3 over @xmath11 , the @xmath0-adic tale cohomology @xmath12 of the associated local system @xmath13",
    "is naturally equipped with the action of @xmath14 . by matsushima s formula ,",
    "this cohomology group is strongly related to the automorphic spectrum of @xmath15 .",
    "if moreover our shimura variety is so - called pel type , namely , obtained as a moduli space of abelian varieties with several additional structures , then it has a natural integral model over @xmath16 , the ring of integers of the completion of @xmath8 at a finite place @xmath17 .",
    "this integral model , also denoted by @xmath9 , is very useful to investigate the action of the galois group @xmath18 on @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath9 is smooth over @xmath16 , the proper smooth base change theorem says that the @xmath0-adic cohomology @xmath20 is canonically isomorphic to the @xmath0-adic cohomology of the special fiber @xmath21 of the integral model . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath18-representation @xmath20 is unramified at @xmath17 , and the alternating sum of the traces of @xmath22 , the frobenius element at @xmath17 , on @xmath20 can be computed by the lefschetz trace formula . even if @xmath9 is not smooth over @xmath16",
    ", we can investigate the action of @xmath23 on @xmath20 by using the theory of nearby cycle functor .",
    "such a method provides an efficient way to establish a part of the langlands correspondence ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for instance .",
    "the crucial point is that the properness of @xmath9 over @xmath16 ensures the coincidence of the cohomology of the generic fiber and the nearby cycle cohomology , that is , the cohomology of the nearby cycle complex over the special fiber .",
    "now we pass to the case where @xmath9 is not compact , while is of pel type .",
    "there are many interesting cases satisfying these conditions , including the modular curves and the siegel modular varieties . for the @xmath0-adic cohomology of a shimura variety over @xmath8",
    ", we have at least three choices ; the ordinary @xmath0-adic cohomology , the compactly supported @xmath0-adic cohomology and the intersection cohomology .",
    "usually we prefer the intersection cohomology , since it has a close relation to the automorphic spectrum of @xmath15 .",
    "however , the theory of minimal compactifications tells us that these three cohomology groups are the same `` up to induced representations '' .",
    "can we use the natural integral model in this case to investigate the galois action on the @xmath0-adic cohomology ?",
    "if @xmath9 is smooth over @xmath16 , fujiwara s trace formula @xcite is a very powerful tool to carry it out . by using it",
    ", one can compute the alternating sum of the traces of the action of @xmath22 on the intersection cohomology @xmath24 ; see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath9 has bad reduction , we can not use exactly the same method as in the compact case , since the nearby cycle cohomology is different from the @xmath0-adic cohomology of the generic fiber , whichever cohomology we choose among the three mentioned above .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to measure the gap between the compactly supported cohomology ( of the shimura variety over @xmath8 ) and the nearby cycle cohomology , that is , the compactly supported cohomology of the nearby cycle complex over the special fiber of the integral model .",
    "our main theorem claims that the gap is non - cuspidal at @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the prime divisible by @xmath17 .",
    "more precise statement is the following :    [ thm : main - thm - intro ] in the kernel and the cokernel of the natural map @xmath26 no irreducible supercuspidal representation of @xmath2 appears as a subquotient .",
    "recall that an irreducible smooth representation of @xmath2 is said to be supercuspidal if it does not appear as a subquotient of parabolically induced representations from any proper parabolic subgroup .    in particular , for an irreducible admissible representation @xmath27 of @xmath7 such that @xmath28 is supercuspidal",
    ", we have an isomorphism of @xmath23-modules @xmath29\\cong    \\bigl(\\varinjlim_{k } h^i_c(\\operatorname{sh}_k\\otimes_{e_v}\\overline{e}_v,\\mathcal{l}_\\xi)\\bigr)[\\pi ] .",
    "\\tag{$*$}\\ ] ] here @xmath30 $ ] denotes the @xmath27-isotypic part ( for precise definition , see notation below ) . as a result , for a representation @xmath27 as above",
    ", the contribution of it to the compactly supported cohomology of the shimura variety can be investigated by using the nearby cycle functor .",
    "note that the same thing holds for the ordinary cohomology and the intersection cohomology , since the gaps between the compactly supported cohomology and these two cohomology groups are non - cuspidal , as already explained .    if an irreducible admissible representation @xmath27 of @xmath7 has a supercuspidal local component @xmath31 at a prime @xmath32 , then it is easy to obtain an isomorphism @xmath33 by using the minimal compactification with hyperspecial level at @xmath25 .",
    "the main difficulty to prove theorem [ thm : main - thm - intro ] is the absence of a good compactification of our integral shimura variety with higher level at @xmath25 .",
    "our main idea to overcome it is to use rigid geometry .",
    "roughly speaking , the gap between the compactly supported cohomology and the nearby cycle cohomology can be measured by the rigid subspace of the generic fiber of our integral model consisting of points corresponding to abelian varieties with bad reduction .",
    "we will find a nice stratification on this rigid subspace to conclude that it is `` geometrically '' induced from proper parabolic subgroups of @xmath2 . to construct the stratification",
    ", we use the theory of arithmetic toroidal compactifications with hyperspecial level at @xmath25 .",
    "such compactifications were constructed by faltings and chai @xcite for siegel modular varieties , and by lan @xcite for general shimura varieties of pel type .",
    "there is also a work by fujiwara on this topic ( @xcite ) .",
    "it will be worth noting that our method is totally geometric and thus is also valid in the torsion coefficient case .",
    "see theorem [ thm : main - thm - mod - l ] for an analogue of theorem [ thm : main - thm - intro ] with the @xmath34-coefficients .",
    "we sketch the outline of this paper . in section 2 ,",
    "we give some preliminary results for constructing a nice stratification . in section 3 , after recalling some notation concerning with shimura varieties of pel type , we give a key geometric construction ; namely , the construction of a stratification on the rigid subspace that measures the gap of two cohomology groups .",
    "we also observe that this stratification behaves well under the hecke action on the tower of shimura varieties . in section 4 ,",
    "we introduce several cohomology groups of the shimura variety and prove theorem [ thm : main - thm - intro ] . in section 5 ,",
    "we give some applications of our main result to unitary shimura varieties .",
    "the authors expect that our result has more interesting applications in a symplectic case",
