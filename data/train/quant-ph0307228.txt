    "the quasi  free propagation of electrons in strong external laser fields is known to play an important role for the interpretation of phenomena that can not be described in perturbation theory : the quantum propagation of photoelectrons in a laser field is essential for the interpretation of non  linear effects such as the generation of plateaus in high  harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "more generally , one expects that a study of the quantum motion of matter waves in external fields will shed light on the occurrence of interesting interference phenomena .",
    "in addition , external fields offer a useful testing ground for analyzing the interplay between classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "an impressive example for the application of a static external electric field in basic laser  atom physics is the so  called photodetachment microscope @xcite which is used to determine electron affinities of negative ions with high accuracy . similarly photodetachment studies in a magnetic field reveal oscillations in the photocurrent spectrum as a function of the energy of the emitted photoelectrons ( for a collection of references and new experiments see @xcite ) .",
    "the observed oscillatory structure is clearly related to the existence of landau levels . in this paper",
    "we will analyze the quantum motion of electrons in crossed static magnetic and electric fields .",
    "one expects the subtle properties of a magnetic field to show up most clearly in two - dimensional motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field . in this way one generates a hall configuration with the electric field @xmath2 ( hall field ) orthogonal to the magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "a convenient way of achieving this goal consists in utilizing the method of green functions .",
    "the green function @xmath4 is linked to the familiar time ",
    "dependent quantum propagator @xmath5 @xcite by means of a laplace transform @xcite : @xmath6 where the propagator represents the probability amplitude for a particle to travel from @xmath7 to @xmath8 in a fixed time @xmath9 .",
    "the energy green function corresponds to the same quantum travel , however with fixed energy @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to realize that ( [ eq : defgr ] ) will automatically lead to a retarded green function , with a matter wave being generated at @xmath11 with part of it subsequently travelling to @xmath7 . for _",
    "free _ particles the green function is the well  known outgoing wave , @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the wave number . in external fields , ( [ eq : wave ] ) will be modified as the wave leaves the source point @xmath8 .",
    "if there are @xmath14 classical ( @xmath15 ) trajectories connecting @xmath8 and @xmath7 , we have to sum over @xmath14 amplitudes in order to obtain the green function in semiclassical ( @xmath16 ) approximation : @xmath17    for the quadratic potentials considered here , the amplitudes @xmath18 are independent of @xmath7 and @xmath8 and are not written down explicitly .",
    "what matters here is hamilton s characteristic function @xmath19 for path number @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath20 is also known as the reduced classical action .",
    "it is related to the classical action @xmath21 via the legendre transformation : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the travel time along the classical path number @xmath0 . since the green function can be interpreted as the wave function of the moving electron , with @xmath8 being the starting point , we can readily calculate the current density @xmath24 of the electron . according to the laws of classical mechanics , the classical momentum of a particle",
    "can be derived from hamilton s characteristic function : @xmath25 it is well known that cycloids describe the classical motion of classical electrons in a combined electric and magnetic field .",
    "however , the _ average _ classical velocity of an electron moving in a plane orthogonal to the @xmath3field is the drift velocity , @xmath26 , which is the same for each path @xmath0 . in view of ( [ eq : semic ] ) we may therefore write @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 have been properly averaged .",
    "what we have demonstrated here is that , by calculating the green function with outgoing  wave boundary conditions we will automatically obtain the @xmath30drift in the classical limit .",
    "as will be shown below , the green function also contains information to what extent an electron with energy @xmath10 will participate in the drift motion . to put it in a more formal way : by utilizing the appropriate green function",
    "we can calculate the local density of states @xmath31 , which plays a central role for calculating the spatial flow pattern of matter waves in external fields . to see this more clearly , we rewrite the operator equation for @xmath32 , @xmath33 in terms of a formal solution @xmath34 where @xmath35 takes care of the outgoing boundary condition . an eigenstate expansion of ( [ eq : gform ] ) then yields @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath38th eigenfunction of h with energy @xmath39 .",
    "defining the so  called local density of states @xmath40 we obtain from ( [ eq : gform ] ) @xmath41 it is the imaginary part of the green function which governs the current of the corresponding quantum motion .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of @xmath31 determines to which extent an electron that travels through @xmath7 with an energy @xmath10 will participate in the motion ( here the @xmath30 drift ) .    from the gauge property of the green function in static electromagnetic fields , @xmath42 g_{{\\boldsymbol{\\cal e}},{\\boldsymbol{\\cal b}}}(\\mathbf{r}- \\mathbf{r'},\\mathbf{o};e + q \\mathbf{r'}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\cal e } } ) \\,\\ ] ] with @xmath43 in our case . in the following",
    "we will call @xmath44 the density of states because @xmath31 is readily obtained from ( [ eq : gauge ] ) . in this paper",
    "we will calculate the density of states @xmath45 for two - dimensional motion in perpendicular , homogeneous electric and magnetic fields .",
    "all necessary results will be derived here ; they are based on a more general approach that is described in detail in @xcite . for a wave function approach",
    "we would like to refer to @xcite .",
    "in the absence of an electric field , the three - dimensional green function for a uniform magnetic field was obtained in closed form in @xcite .",
    "also , for a purely magnetic field , the two - dimensional density of states is known @xcite to show a spike - like structure , formally written as a superposition of discrete @xmath46distributions positioned at the landau levels at @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the larmor frequency : @xmath49\\right).\\ ] ] as we will show below , the presence of an electric field broadens the @xmath46distribution of the @xmath0th landau level into a smooth function of overall gaussian form that is modulated into @xmath1 distinct sublevels .",
    "the desired propagator is governed by the hamiltonian of a 2d - electron in crossed fields , @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the electric force in the @xmath52@xmath53-plane .",
    "the result is @xcite : @xmath54 \\right\\ } .\\ ] ] to account for the effects of the electron spin , we note that the spin adds a constant term @xmath55 to the hamiltonian and thus merely shifts the energy by this amount @xcite .",
    "the spin dependent densities of states become @xmath56 and the total density of states including spin can be mapped back to the one without spin : @xmath57 .",
    "thus we evaluate @xmath45 and defer the inclusion of spin for the moment .    for the discussion of the density of states in crossed fields it is useful to transform the trigonometric functions in the propagator into a sum over landau levels .",
    "this can be done using the identity @xmath58}{\\sinh(z ) } = 2\\rme^{-\\alpha } \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty { \\rm{l}}_k^{(0)}(2\\alpha)\\exp\\left[-2z \\left(k+ \\frac12 \\right)\\right],\\ ] ] which follows after substituting @xmath59 in the generating function of the laguerre polynomials @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the green function therefore reads @xmath61 = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty n_{k,{\\boldsymbol{\\cal e}}\\times{\\boldsymbol{\\cal b}}}(e),\\ ] ] where the partial density of states assigned to the @xmath0th landau level is given by : @xmath62}^2 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the level width parameter @xmath63 is related to the magnetic length @xmath64 , and @xmath65 denotes the effective energy shift for the @xmath0th level : @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : doseb ] ) , we evaluated the integral over @xmath9 and expressed the result in terms of hermite polynomials @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the density of states is identical to a sum over the probability densities of the eigenstates of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath68}^2 .\\ ] ] it should be emphasized that the oscillator functions depend here on the energy @xmath10 and not on a space variable .",
    "the dimensionless energy variable reads @xmath69 , with the @xmath0th eigenstate being centered around the @xmath0th landau level , apart from an overall shift @xmath70 accounting for the kinetic energy of the drifting electrons .",
    "this result is also consistent with the mapping of the original hamiltonian in crossed fields in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heb ] ) to the hamiltonian of a shifted harmonic oscillator .",
    "details of the corresponding canonical transformation and its unitary representation are presented in ref .",
    "the total contribution of the @xmath0th landau level integrated over energy - space is readily available from the normalization of the oscillator eigenstates : @xmath71 this result reflects the quantization of each landau level in a purely magnetic field , as given by eq .",
