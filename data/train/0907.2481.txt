    "the universe is ultimately observer - participatory , each part of which is communicating with the others and never at rest .",
    "existence are not simply `` things just out there '' , but reality for an observer is his dynamical construction . both quantum theory and relativity , the two pillars of our modern conceptual understanding of nature , taught us so , although the great union of the two remains a mystery still .",
    "we shall hence aim at a further understanding of the observer s quantum description of matter in a general relativistic background .",
    "we first discuss the multiple motivations of this paper .    1 .",
    "quantum field theory in curved spacetime is the necessary first step towards a conceptual understanding of a quantum theory of gravity . even though such a framework is ultimately incomplete , we expect some features of the theory to remain .",
    "we shall treat the quantum field like a `` test field '' with the background spacetime completely classical and unaffected by the matter field .",
    "2 .   we view physics as a theory of an arbitrary observer s dynamical description of his system .",
    "therefore any physical theory should be formulated explicitly in terms of an observer s own physical quantities at a fundamental level .",
    "there have been great conceptual advancements in understanding the observer - dependent aspects of quantum field theory [ 1 - 6 ] . rather than treating observer - dependence as an emergent feature",
    ", we now push these developments further by taking observer - dependence to be a cornerstone of our formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "3 .   working at a semi - classical level , we shall understand an observer as a history of spacetime events , in other words , a timelike curve in a classical curved spacetime .",
    "a quantum state is a quantum description of the physical system for the observer at some proper time of his .",
    "we consider dynamics as the updating of his description of the system rather than as the `` changing of things in themselves '' .",
    "above all , we would like to construct a theory specifying a one - parameter family of quantum states along a timelike worldline .",
    "dynamics is the specification of a one - parameter family of physical states , whether they be points in classical phase spaces or vectors in hilbert spaces or some other mathematical representation .",
    "therefore intrinsic to dynamics is a notion of `` time '' .",
    "a notion of time is usually only available in special cases .",
    "one may restrain oneself to the notion of asymptotic past / future only , but this does not define a parameter of physical time . there is a `` natural '' choice of time if the spacetime manifold admits a special symmetry , like the killing time for stationary spacetimes or the usual cosmic time of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology .",
    "however , the last two choices are rather mathematical and only apply to special cases .",
    "we would instead like a single physically - motivated definition applicable to all situations .",
    "the only possibility of such a definition is the proper time on an observer s clock .",
    "such a choice in fact forces one to adopt an observer - dependent description of physics , which is precisely what we have been aiming for .",
    "5 .   in this paper",
    "we shall take a hilbert space approach in that we consider hilbert spaces to be the most fundamental objects mathematically representing our quantum description of physical systems .",
    "quantum states are vectors or more generally density matrices in these spaces .",
    "such a mathematical framework is especially suitable for discussing quantum state evolution , where a two - parameter mapping @xmath0 relates a quantum state in a hilbert space at some time @xmath1 for an observer to another state in a possibly different hilbert space at time @xmath2 .",
    "the hilbert space approach is also particularly suitable for discussing any possible loss of information in the form of a pure state evolving to a mixed density matrix .",
    "there are two important conceptual lessons that we should draw from hawking s semi - classical analysis of black hole information loss .",
    "firstly , hawking has insisted that any quantum state for the observer outside the black hole must be physically meaningful for him : to obtain the correct description of the quantum system according to the observer , we must trace out all degrees of freedom that he can not causally access .",
    "as we shall see , our quantum theory is precisely defined over the spacetime region causally connected to the given observer . secondly ,",
    "that there is a loss of information when black hole evaporates indicates that the loss of information is rooted in the `` evolution '' of a horizon rather than simply the presence of a horizon . to make precise sense of evolution one again needs a notion of time , which we have chosen to be the proper time of an observer . 7",
    "we shall speculate that there will be a non - unitary evolution and hence information loss for an observer , precisely when his surface of simultaneity evolves from a cauchy surface to a non - cauchy surface for the spacetime region to which the observer has causal access . instead of resolving information loss as a paradox",
    ", we propose to forcefully carry hawking s argument through and speculate that the possibility of information loss is a fundamental feature of quantum field theory in curved spacetime rather than special to black hole evaporation .",
    "8 .   to obtain physical quantities from the point of view of an observer",
    ", one normally has to study the response of a model particle detector following the observer s worldline .",
    "we would instead like to have a fundamental theory in which the particle content at any time can be simply read off from the mathematical representation of the physical state .",
    "furthermore a quantum state , which completely encodes all information about the possible measurement outcomes and their probabilities of occurrence , tells much more than simply the particle spectrum , in particular whether the quantum state is pure or mixed .",
    "wald has forcefully argued that there is no natural choice of fock space of particles in quantum field theory in a most general spacetime , and that this is in analogy to choosing a coordinate system on a manifold in general relativity which can not be physical .",
    "but for a given observer , as we shall show , there indeed exists a natural notion of `` particles '' .",
    "there have been serious difficulties in attempting to define a notion of particles in a most general spacetime , but this does not imply that the idea of `` particle '' itself is not fundamental , as long as one takes an observer - dependent viewpoint of quantum field theory .",
    "a notion of particles is usually only available in special cases such as if the spacetime admits a special symmetry or special asymptotic behaviours , or if the physical situation admits an adiabatic approximation .",
    "however generalisation is essential , as elements particular to special cases can obscure what the fundamental features are .",
    "the formulation which we will present can be applied rather generally to a wide class of observers without requiring any special symmetries or asymptotic behaviours of the spacetime .",
    "unlike in e.g. , here we shall make no fundamental distinction between particle creation due to the motion of the observer and that due purely to gravitational fields .",
    "we view spacetime as a geometric and causal background in which the observer s worldline is defined .",
    "all observers are regarded as completely equivalent at the fundamental level of quantum field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "ashtekar and magnon have constructed a one - parameter family of fock spaces in their formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "the authors found their construction to depend on a choice of timelike vector field and hence of the corresponding integral curves .",
    "they were therefore forced to conclude that their theory depends on a field of observers . rather than be led to a conclusion of observer - dependence , we have taken as our conceptual starting point the construction of a quantum field theory with observer - dependence .",
    "one might interpret ashtekar and magnon s construction , which depends on a congruence of timelike curves , to be for a family of observers .",
    "however , we insist any physical theory should be formulated for an arbitrary single observer .",
    "mathematically , as we shall show , the construction of the family of fock spaces depends only on a choice of scalar function @xmath3 and a corresponding foliation . physically , if one starts with a single observer , in a most general situation it is far from clear how to choose a family which he is a member of .",
    "furthermore , specifying an arbitrary family of observers has no direct physical interpretation as one can never set up an experiment with an uncountably many number of detectors which trace out a congruence of curves covering the entire spacetime .",
    "finally , one expects that different observers within one family , even if there is such a preferred grouping , would differ in their description of a physical system .",
    "one therefore would like this difference to be naturally accounted for and built into the fundamental theory . 14 .",
    "this work in some sense parallels einstein s construction of special relativity .",
    "just as the principle of relativity is the guiding principle of special relativity , it is our conceptual starting point that the same laws of quantum field theory should apply to any arbitrary observer , although the observers dynamical quantum descriptions may differ .",
    "secondly , just as einstein recognised the inseparable connection between time and the signal velocity , we shall apply radar time , which is operationally defined using light signal communication , to formulating quantum field theory for an arbitrary observer in a general spacetime .",
    "the plan of the paper is given as follows .    in section 2",
    ", we shall construct a one - parameter family of fock spaces based on the formalism of ashtekar and magnon .",
    "we shall show that the formalism requires a choice of scalar function @xmath3 .    in section 3",
    ", we shall apply radar time to operationally define this function @xmath3 for each point which a given observer can both send a signal to and receive a signal from .",
    "we regard defining quantum field theory in the spacetime region causally connected to a given observer as an axiom of our framework . in section 3.1",
    "we discuss the importance of cauchy surfaces in the formulation of a unitary theory and the preservation of information .    in section 4 ,",
    "we construct the dynamics of quantum states in our theory .",
    "we define quantum evolution in terms of a two - parameter mapping from one fock space to another , each associated with a time for an observer , and we show this mapping satisfies certain necessary physical conditions .",
    "finally in section 5 , we summarise our main results and consider possible directions in which our work might be developed .",
    "we shall use natural units throughout this paper .",
    "the sign convention in general relativity is the same as that of , in particular , @xmath4 .",
    "in this section , we shall construct a one - parameter family of fock spaces of the free real scalar field based on the work of ashtekar and magnon .",
    "definitions and notations are introduced which will be used throughout the subsequent sections .",
    "we shall summarise the formalism in a form most simple and ready for our purpose of the hilbert space approach as motivated in section 1 .",
    "in particular , we shall not start from the * -algebra of abstract field operators of .",
    "let @xmath5 be the vector space of all well - behaved are smooth and induce , on any spacelike cauchy surface , initial data sets of compact support .",
    "the assumption about compact support is used to ensure convergence of various integrals and to discard various surface terms when integrating by parts . ]",

    "the use of the index notation @xmath29 will become clear in section 4 .",

    "to finish the construction , it remains to specify a one - parameter family of complex structures @xmath31 satisfying ( [ symplectic1 ] ) and ( [ symplectic2 ] ) .",

    "we would like to understand how the events of a given spacetime are directly related to the local physical quantities of the observer in an operational way .    to understand the physical meaning of this `` time '' and `` simultaneity '' , we first look at an inertial observer @xmath56 in minkowski spacetime .",

    "firstly , our definition using light signal communication has a clear operational meaning .",
    "secondly , in minkowksi spacetime with the usual coodinates @xmath79 , the constant @xmath3 surfaces are the usual planes of simultaneity for an inertial observer with constant @xmath80 , and the specification of the entire trajectory of constant @xmath80 is essential .",
    "thirdly , if two observers locally coincide around a common point , their surfaces of simultaneity through that point will also be locally the same .",
    "one could instead naively define simultaneity surface @xmath75 to be the set of all points lying in geodesics orthogonal to the observer s trajectory @xmath56 at @xmath73 .",
    "this definition of @xmath75 depends only on the point @xmath81 and its tangent vector , and for an arbitrary observer @xmath56 in minkowski spacetime it gives the usual simultaneity plane for the inertial observer tangent to @xmath56 at @xmath81 .",
    "however , the physical meaning of these surfaces for an arbitrary observer becomes unclear far from the worldline .",
    "furthermore , these surfaces may intersect within the observer s diamond , so that the `` time '' of the point of intersection becomes ambiguous under this definition . our definition of simultaneity does not suffer from the same problem , as each point in the diamond of the observer belongs to exactly one simultaneity surface .",
    "we have defined a scalar function @xmath3 and a corresponding foliation @xmath33 of the diamond region of an arbitrary observer .",
    "application of this idea to the formalism summarised in section 2 implies that we should treat the diamond as the physically relevant part of spacetime for the observer , on which the vector space @xmath5 of real klein - gordon solutions is defined .",
    "operationally , only those events in the diamond of an observer are physically relevant to him .",
    "if there exists a future - directed null geodesic originating from a point in @xmath56 to a point @xmath55 , then one may naively say that the observer can send a signal to @xmath55 .",
    "however this has no causal effect on him if there is no future - directed null geodesic from @xmath55 to @xmath56 . the only way that the observer is able to operationally determine whether @xmath55 has received his signal is if in principle he can receive a reply from @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , any event @xmath61 to which there is no future - directed null geodesic from @xmath56 connecting is physically irrelevant .",
    "it is in fact a more or less usual practice in quantum field theory that one interprets only the degrees of freedom in the region causally connected to the observer as the physically relevant ones . in the example of the rindler observers , only the field in the rindler wedge",
    "is considered relevant . for observers staying outside of a black hole ,",
    "only the field outside the black hole horizon is relevant . and for an inertial minkowski observer of a finite - lengthed worldline , only the field in the observer s diamond region is relevant . rather than interpreting the physically relevant spacetime region for a given observer on a case by case basis , we here regard defining quantum field theory on only the diamond for an arbitrary observer as an axiom of our framework .",
    "the formalism in section 2 requires that each surface @xmath32 of the foliation be a cauchy surface .",
    "our slicing of the diamond for an arbitrary observer defined earlier in this section , however , does not sastisfy this requirement in general",
    ". it may indeed be the case that all simultaneity surfaces of the observer are cauchy surfaces for his diamond , as in the case of the rindler observer .",
    "but it may also be that at least one but not all simultaneity surfaces are cauchy surfaces , as in the case of an inertial minkowski observer with a finite worldline ; or that none of the simultaneity surfaces are cauchy surfaces , such as a co - moving observer in the milne universe , even though the spacetime is globally hyperbolic .    in the next section",
    ", we shall construct a unitary quantum theory in the case that all simultaneity surfaces are cauchy surfaces .",
    "the construction for the more general cases has to remain future work .",
    "however , we argue here that the limitation of the current formulation should not be regarded as a fundamental flaw of our conceptual approach . we instead interpret this restriction as revealing the importance of cauchy surfaces in the formulation of a unitary theory and the preservation of information .",
    "we shall now speculate on the qualitative features of the theory for the more general cases .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath82 be an observer s proper time with @xmath83 . generally , when surface @xmath84 is not contained in the future cauchy development @xmath85 of surface @xmath86 , one can not determine the data on @xmath84 and hence the physical state at @xmath2 from the data on @xmath86 , and therefore the dynamics of the theory is non - deterministic .",
    "conversely , if all of @xmath84 lies in @xmath85 but not all of @xmath86 lies in @xmath87 , where @xmath87 is the past cauchy development of @xmath84 , then evolution of the field from @xmath86 to @xmath84 is deterministic but non - invertible and hence there is a loss of information .",
    "there will exist timelike curves crossing @xmath86 but not @xmath84 , which physically means that there will exist worldlines of objects leaving the observer s horizon before he reaches @xmath2 .    in the case",
    "where only one of the simultaneity surfaces @xmath75 is a cauchy surface , such as the example in , one can determine the field throughout the entire diamond from @xmath75 .",
    "one can predict the future of @xmath75 , but information is lost as the field evolves from @xmath75 to a future simultaneity surface .",
    "one can also `` postdict '' at @xmath73 what happened before that time , although before @xmath73 he can not predict what happens at @xmath73 : there is more for him to learn , but in retrospect nothing is surprising .",
    "we now consider the implications of the above discussion for the example of a gravitationally collapsing black hole without evaporation .",
    "as shown in figure 2 ( a ) , an arbitrary observer that does not fall into the black hole has a diamond corresponding to spacetime outside the black hole horizon .",
    "if the causal structure and the simultaneity surfaces are correctly depicted in our figure where all simultaneity surfaces are cauchy surfaces , then we see that the observer s quantum field theory is unitary and that no information is lost .",
    "this is consistent with the intuition that an observer remaining outside the black hole never in his finite proper time sees an object falling behind the horizon and no information carried by the in - falling object could ever disappear from the sight of the observer .",
    "even though the observer can not access spacetime behind the horizon , that region is physically irrelevant to him : he does not know everything , but at least he knows what he knew .    in the spacetime of black hole with evaporation , however , we speculate that not all simultaneity surfaces will be cauchy surfaces for the diamond of the observer staying outside of the black hole , as depicted in figure 2 ( b ) . we expect that in the figure , @xmath84 will lie in @xmath85 , but @xmath86 will not be contained in @xmath87 .",
    "hence it follows that evolution will be deterministic , but information will be lost , a profound and long renowned proposal due to hawking .",
    "wald has already pointed out that there should generally be a loss of information associated with evolution of a cauchy surface to a non - cauchy surface .",
    "here we have further developed the idea . with our one - parameter family of hypersurfaces",
    "@xmath33 constructed previously , we are able to provide wald s `` evolution of surfaces '' a precise mathematical meaning . physically , we give these `` surfaces '' an operational meaning as the simultaneity surfaces of a given observer .",
    "moreover , the question of whether or not a surface is a cauchy surface is now addressed with respect to the observer s diamond .",
    "we have emphasised that the observer should play a fundamental role in the discussion of a possible non - unitary quantum theory .",

    "each fock space is based on a hilbert space constructed from the vector space @xmath5 of real - valued klein - gordon solutions and a parameter - dependent complex structure @xmath31 .",
    "this construction requires a choice of scalar function @xmath3 such that each constant @xmath3 hypersurface @xmath32 is a spacelike cauchy surface .",
    "we then applied this mathematical formalism for an arbitrary observer to the region of spacetime which the observer can both send signals to and receive signals from .",
    "following , we have used the terminology `` diamond '' to refer to this region .",
    "we argue that radar time should be applied for the above function @xmath3 used in the construction of the fock spaces .",
    "physically this means @xmath32 , the set of points in the diamond with radar time @xmath3 , is the set of all events `` simultaneous '' to the observer at his proper time @xmath3 .",
    "our definition using light signal communication has a clear operational meaning and directly relates each point to the observer s local physical quantities .",
    "our slicing applies to all observers and reflects the causal structure of the underlying spacetime .",
    "although the diamond of an observer in general may not cover the entire spacetime , it is operationally the only region physically relevant to the observer .",
    "we therefore define the vector space @xmath5 of real klein - gordon solutions and our quantum field theory on the diamond of a given observer .",
    "we regard this as an axiom of our framework .    in the case",
    "where all simultaneity surfaces of an observer are cauchy surfaces of his diamond , we have constructed a unitary dynamics where no information is lost : given a quantum state for an observer at his proper time @xmath1 , we constructed a two - parameter mapping @xmath0 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 that will give us the evolved state at time @xmath2 .",
    "we require our mapping to satisfy three conditions : that @xmath108 is an isomorphism ; that the mapping preserves the inner product ; and that the mapping satisfies @xmath209 .",
    "the action of @xmath108 on @xmath112 is specified by its action on the vector space @xmath114 of creation and annihilation operators given by ( [ aaa ] ) , as well as its action on the vacuum in @xmath112 .",
    "the construction is guided by the intuition that there is an evolution of operators in @xmath114 according to a change in the complex structure @xmath210 , as well as according to an evolution @xmath137 of the operators underlying classical fields , i.e. an automorphism on @xmath129 .",
    "the evolution of vacuum state is given by ( [ vac_evol ] ) and satisfies ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "we have deduced that particle creation will take place if and only if @xmath31 fails to evolve according to @xmath211 .    we have also speculated on features that the theory covering the more general cases might have .",
    "we have further developed wald s insight that there should generally be a loss of information when there is evolution of a cauchy surface to a non - cauchy surface .",
    "our one - parameter foliation of the diamond gives this `` evolution of surfaces '' a precise mathematical meaning .",
    "physically , we give these `` surfaces '' an operational meaning as the simultaneity surfaces of a given observer . moreover , the question of whether or not a surface is a cauchy surface is now addressed with respect to the observer s diamond .",
    "above all , we speculate that information will be lost precisely whenever an observer s surface of simultaneity evolves from a cauchy surface to a non - cauchy surface , whether this be due to the background spacetime or to the observer s motion in that background .",
    "this generalises hawking s original insight and takes the information loss of black hole evaporation as just a special case .",
    "+   + there is much scope for future generalisations and applications of this work .    1 .",
    "we would like to generalise our current formulation to the cases when not all surfaces of simultaneity of an observer are cauchy surfaces for his diamond . as we evolve data from a cauchy surface to a non - cauchy surface , we need a general scheme to trace out the field degrees of freedom lost along the worldline of the observer",
    ". such a scheme would also consolidate our speculations about information loss .",
    "it is important to apply our framework to various examples , especially to see how our results would compare with experiments and with the results obtained by other formulations , such as with canonical quantization or with model particle detectors .",
    "+ in particular , it would be very important to explore quantum field theory in frw cosmology using our formalism , where the simultaneity surfaces for a co - moving observer are not the usual surfaces of constant energy density .",
    "this offers the opportunity to test our theory with cosmological observations .",
    "we would like to generalise our formalism to higher - spin fields and interacting fields .",
    "one important extension of our work is to study quantum state transformation between arbitrary observers and its operational meaning . given a quantum state for an observer @xmath88 at time @xmath73 , we would like to know the corresponding state for another observer @xmath89 at time @xmath90 .",
    "we require such a transformation to be consistent with the state evolution we have already constructed .",
    "we constructed a unitary dynamics relating a quantum state at some time of an observer to a state at a later time .",
    "however we have not discussed , for an arbitrary observer in curved spacetime , how a quantum measurment projects quantum states nor how the notion of `` wavefunction collapse '' should be understood .",
    "one of the most intriguing aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetime is the yet to be understood deep relationship between causal horizons and thermodynamics .",
    "firstly , it has been argued that the ultimate significance of the thermodynamics of black hole horizons hangs on the issue of its generalisation . in our framework , the diamond for an arbitrary observer provides a natural and most general notion of causal horizons , and by defining quantum theory over this region , our formalism naturally establishes a link between quantum theory and causal horizons . +",
    "secondly , thermodynamics of causal horizons can be studied using a statistical mechanics approach .",
    "this requires a concept of particles , and our formulation indeed provides a notion of particles for each observer . on the other hand",
    ", it would also be very enlightening from our formalism to obtain an expression directly relating thermodynamic quantities and properties of causal horizons without needing to consider any particle spectrum .",
    "+ finally , it has been argued that entropy is an observer - dependent quantity .",
    "our observer - dependent quantum field theory may be an ideal framework for a further investigation of the observer - dependence of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we propose that observer - dependence as a fundamental feature of quantum field theory should be taken much further .",
    "since the quantum states of particles in general depend on the observer , therefore different observers will have different @xmath212 , the expectation values of the energy - momentum associated with their respective quantum states . by einstein s field equations , the quantum field s back - reaction on the spacetime metric",
    "will also be observer - dependent and hence so will the spacetime metric itself .",
    "indeed , the possibility that spacetime itself may be observer - dependent has been suggested by gibbons and hawking .",
    "such a profound suggestion merits further investigation which our framework may be well - suited to pursue , and this investigation may indeed be the correct path leading to a complete and consistent union of quantum theory and relativity .",
    "i would like to thank rex liu for discussions , david wiltshire and steffen gielen for comments and jonathan oppenheim for criticisms ."
