    "in this paper we shall attempt to provide a complete picture of the stability and instability of extreme reissner - nordstrm backgrounds under linear scalar perturbations , extending the results of @xcite on the wave equation @xmath3 here we derive definitive energy and pointwise decay , non - decay and blow - up results for solutions @xmath4 to the wave equation and their derivatives in the domain of outer communications up to and including the event horizon @xmath2 .",
    "note that the picture we obtain is in sharp contrast with the non - extreme case where decay holds for all higher order derivatives of @xmath4 along @xmath5 .",
    "the extreme reissner - nordstrm metric in coordinates @xmath6 takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a positive constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the standard metric on @xmath11 .",
    "the event horizon @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath12 , the black hole region to @xmath13 and the domain of outer communications to @xmath14 .",
    "the photon sphere is located at @xmath15 .    for the reader",
    "s convenience we recall that the main results of @xcite include : 1 ) non - degenerate energy and pointwise uniform boundedness of solutions , up to and including @xmath2 , 2 ) local integrated decay of energy , up to and including the event horizon @xmath2 , 3 ) sharp second order @xmath16 estimates , up to and including @xmath2 , 4 ) non - decay along @xmath2 of higher order translation invariant quantities for spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "recall also that @xmath16 spacetime estimates which do not degenerate at the photon sphere require commutation with the killing vector field @xmath17 .",
    "this is the so - called trapping effect at the photon sphere .",
    "note that another characteristic feature of degenerate horizons which was exposed in @xcite is that obtaining @xmath16 spacetime estimates which do not degenerate at the horizon @xmath2 requires commutation with the ( non - killing ) vector field @xmath18 and , therefore , loss of derivatives characteristic of trapping takes place on degenerate horizons in analogy to the photon sphere .      in the present paper",
    ", we combine the previous results of @xcite with certain new techniques to obtain definitive decay , non - decay and blow - up results .",
    "in particular , we present a method based on an adaptation of @xcite to derive degenerate and non - degenerate energy decay .",
    "this adaptation requires the introduction of yet another vector field @xmath19 and is necessary in view of the degeneracy of the surface gravity on the horizon .",
    "we also introduce a new method for obtaining sharp pointwise decay results .",
    "the instability properties of @xmath4 ( non - decay and blow - up for derivatives of @xmath4 ) rest upon a hierarchy of conservation laws on a specific class of degenerate horizons ( which includes the extreme reissner - nordstrm ) presented here for the first time .",
    "as we shall see , these laws are of great analytical importance .",
    "recall that in @xcite we derived a conservation law for the spherical mean @xmath20 of solutions @xmath4 to the wave equation based on the degeneracy of the redshift along @xmath5 .",
    "however , as we shall see , on top of the degeneracy of the redshift , the event horizon satisfies an additional property which allows us to obtain a hierarchy of such laws .",
    "specifically , we show that _ a conservation law holds for every projection @xmath21 of @xmath4 ( viewed as an @xmath16 function on the spheres of symmetry ) on the eigenspace @xmath22 of the spherical laplacian @xmath23 ( for all spherical harmonic numbers @xmath24)_.    according to these laws a linear combination of the transversal derivatives of @xmath21 of order at most @xmath25 is conserved along the null geodesics of @xmath2 ( see theorem [ t3 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] ) .",
    "as we shall see , these conserved quantities allow us to infer the instability properties of extreme black holes described in section [ sec : higherorderpointwiseestimates1 ] , and thus , understanding their structure is crucial and essential .",
    "of course , no such conserved quantities exist in the subextreme case .    as an aside , based on these laws",
    ", we also explicitly show that the schwarzschild boundedness argument of kay and wald @xcite can not be applied in the extreme case , i.e.  we show that for generic @xmath4 , there does not exist a cauchy hypersurface @xmath26 crossing @xmath2 and a solution @xmath27 such that @xmath28 in the causal future of @xmath26 ( where @xmath17 ) .",
    "the existence of such @xmath27 was key for the argument of @xcite .",
    "we next establish higher order @xmath16 estimates of the derivatives of @xmath4 by commuting repeatedly with the vector field @xmath18 ; see theorem [ theorem3 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] .",
    "in view of the conservation laws one expects to derive @xmath29th order ( @xmath30 @xmath16 estimates close to @xmath2 only if @xmath31 for all @xmath32 .",
    "in fact in section [ sec : higherorderestimates ] we show that if the above restriction on the frequency range is not satisfied then no such estimate can be derived . by using appropriate modifications and hardy inequalities",
    "we obtain the sharpest possible result .",
    "see section [ sharpl2 ] .",
    "note that the spacetime term of such estimates degenerates with respect to the transversal derivative to @xmath2 . in order to retrieve this derivative one",
    "needs to commute once again with @xmath18 , use hardy inequalities and thus assume that an initial quantity of even higher order is bounded .",
    "this reflects _ the higher order trapping effect present on @xmath2 _ ( recall that the case @xmath33 was treated in @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty in deriving such @xmath16 estimates comes from the fact that the trapping effect is coupled with the low - frequency obstruction described in section [ sec : conservationlawsonmathcalh ] .",
    "using an adaptation of the methods developed in the recent @xcite , we obtain energy and pointwise decay for @xmath4 .",
    "see theorems [ t4 ] and [ t6 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] .",
    "recall that in @xcite , a general framework is provided for obtaining energy decay .",
    "the ingredients necessary for applying the framework are : 1 ) good asymptotics of the metric towards null infinity , 2 ) uniform boundedness of energy and 3 ) integrated local energy decay ( where the spacetime integral of energy should be controlled by the energy of @xmath4 and , in view of the trapping effect at the photon sphere , of @xmath34 too ) .",
    "we first verify that extreme reissner - nordstrm satisfies the first hypothesis .",
    "however , in view of the trapping and the conservation laws on the event horizon @xmath2 , it turns out that the method described in @xcite can not be directly used to yield decay results in the extreme case .",
    "indeed , the third hypothesis of @xcite is not satisfied in extreme reissner - nordstrm . for this reason",
    ", we introduce a new causal vector field @xmath19 which allows us to obtain _ several hierarchies of estimates in an appropriate neighbourhood of @xmath2_. these estimates avoid multipliers or commutators with weights in @xmath35 , following the philosophy of @xcite .",
    "our method applies to black hole spacetimes where trapping is present on @xmath2 ( including , in particular , a wide class of extreme black holes ) .",
    "pointwise decay for @xmath36 then follows by commuting with the generators of so(3 ) and sobolev estimates . regarding the cases @xmath37 , we present a new method which is based on the interpolation of previous estimates which hold close to @xmath5 and away from @xmath5 .",
    "note that the low angular frequencies decay more slowly than the higher ones .",
    "see section [ sec : pointwiseestimates ] .",
    "we finally mention that blue and soffer have previously proved in @xcite that a weighted @xmath38 norm in space decays like @xmath39 .",
    "however , this weight degenerates on the horizon and the initial data have to be supported away from @xmath5 .      in order to provide a complete picture of the behaviour of solutions @xmath4 ,",
    "it remains to derive pointwise estimates for all derivatives of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the projection of @xmath4 on the eigenspace @xmath22 of the spherical laplacian @xmath23 , as above .",
    "then the derivatives transversal to @xmath2 of @xmath21 decay if the order of the differentiation is at most @xmath40 .",
    "if the order is @xmath25 , then for generic initial data this derivative converges along @xmath2 to a non - zero number and thus * does not decay*. by generic initial data we mean data for which certain quantities do not vanish on @xmath2 .",
    "if , moreover , the order is at least @xmath41 , then for generic initial data these derivatives * blow up * asymptotically along @xmath2 .",
    "note that these differential operators are translation invariant and do not depend on the choice of a coordinate system . _",
    "the blow - up of these geometric quantities suggests that extreme black holes are dynamically unstable . _",
    "if , on the other hand , we consider the wave @xmath42 then one needs to differentiate at least @xmath43 times in the transversal direction to obtain a quantity which blows up .",
    "see theorems [ theo8 ] and [ theo9 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] .",
    "therefore , the @xmath44 derivatives decays faster than @xmath4 .",
    "] counteract the action of the derivatives transversal to @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude this paper by deriving similar decay and blow - up results for the higher order non - degenerate energy .",
    "in particular , we show that although ( an appropriate modification of ) the redshift current can be used as a multiplier for all angular frequencies , the redshift vector field @xmath45 can only be used as a commutator for @xmath4 supported on the frequencies @xmath46 and , more generally , _",
    "one can commute with the redshift vector field at most @xmath40 times for @xmath4 supported on the angular frequency @xmath40_. see section [ sec : higherorderestimates ] .",
    "an important problem is that of understanding the solutions of the wave equation on the extreme kerr spacetime .",
    "this spacetime is not spherically symmetric and there is no globally causal killing field in the domain of outer communications ( in particular , @xmath44 becomes spacelike close to the event horizon ) .",
    "recent results @xcite overcome these difficulties for the whole subextreme range of kerr .",
    "the extreme case remains open .",
    "another related problem is that of the wave equation coupled with the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "then decay for the scalar field was proven in the deep work of dafermos and rodnianski @xcite .",
    "again these results hold for non - extreme black holes . for the extreme case",
    "even boundedness of the scalar field for this system remains open .",
    "we consider the cauchy problem for the wave equation on the domain of outer communications of extreme reissner - nordstrm spacetimes ( including @xmath5 ) with initial data @xmath47 where the hypersurface @xmath1 crosses @xmath5 and terminates either at spacelike infinity @xmath48 or at null infinity @xmath49 and @xmath50 denotes the future unit normal of @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that @xmath51 and that @xmath52 for simplicity , from now on , when we say  for all solutions @xmath4 of the wave equation \" we will assume that @xmath4 satisfies the above conditions .",
    "note that for obtaining sharp decay results we will have to consider even higher regularity for @xmath4 .      for the definition of the relevant notions and notation used throughout the paper we refer to @xcite . for the convenience of the reader",
    ", we briefly recall the notation ( and conventions ) necessary for understanding the statement of the main theorems .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the projection of @xmath4 on the eigenspace @xmath22 ( with corresponding eigenvalue @xmath53 ) of the spherical laplacian @xmath23 .",
    "we will say that @xmath4 is supported on the angular frequencies @xmath54 if @xmath55 initially ( and thus everywhere ) .",
    "similarly , we will also say that @xmath4 is supported on the angular frequency @xmath56 if @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath45 be a @xmath58invariant timelike vector field which coincides with @xmath44 away from @xmath5 ( as defined in section 10 of @xcite ) .",
