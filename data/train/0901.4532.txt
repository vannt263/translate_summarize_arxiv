    "the majority of the interesting physics processes at the international linear collider ( ilc ) involve multi - jet final states originating from hadronic decays of heavy gauge bosons .",
    "to fulfill its physics goals , the reconstructed di - jet mass resolutions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays should be comparable to their widths .",
    "this di - jet mass resolution , in turn , requires di - jet energy resolution to be as good as @xmath2 within the approximation @xmath3 . in order to achieve this goal ,",
    "the particle flow algorithm ( pfa ) approach has been adopted by the silicon detector ( sid ) and the international large detector ( ild ) : two leading detector concepts at the ilc .",
    "the goal of a particle flow algorithm is to reconstruct events at the level of individual particles , identifying charged and neutral particles separately in the calorimeters with minimal confusion .",
    "the energy of the shower from each charged particle is replaced by the momentum of its track measured in the tracking system which has orders of magnitude better precision than the calorimeters while the energy of photons and neutral hadrons are obtained from the calorimeters . without any confusion between charged and neutral showers in the calorimeters , a theoretical jet energy resolution of approx .",
    "@xmath4 can be reached . in reality , however , it is not feasible to disentangle all charged showers from close - by neutral showers  @xcite .",
    "the shower leakage also has been shown as the another main source of deterioration of resolution  @xcite . due to confusion and leakage ,",
    "the theoretical limit can not be reached .",
    "muon identification can reduce the confusion as presented in this paper .",
    "we present here the current status of the pfa based on the sid concept developed by the university of iowa group in collaboration with slac national accelerator center ( slac ) and others .",
    "for the pfa performance , we use monte carlo ( mc ) samples of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 at 500 gev and @xmath7 samples at 100 , 200 , 360 and 500 gev with 10000 events each generated with geant4 simulation of sid .",
    "lcio serves as persistent data format .",
    "initially the pfa at the university of iowa was developed with a ` cheat ' tracking .",
    "now we use the tracking package  @xcite for the pfa while the cheat tracks can still be used for development .",
    "initial track and cluster association in pfa identifies photons , electrons and muons .",
    "electromagnetic ( em ) showers are firstly reconstructed by looking at the shape and location of the cluster .",
    "clusters in the em showers which are unassociated with tracks are reconstructed as photons .",
    "clusters identified as the em showers whose position coincides with a charged track and whose energy matches the track s momentum are identified as electrons .",
    "a muon is reconstructed by matching the extrapolated track in the calorimeters , consistent with energy deposited by a minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) , with the muon direction obtained from hits in the muon detector .",
    "the details are discussed in section  [ sec : muon ] .",
    "these reconstructed tracks and clusters do not participate in the later clustering for charged hadron showers .",
    "initial clustering is done for each sub - detector using hits in the calorimeters and the muon endcap system .",
    "better jet energy resolution is obtained when the muon endcap is used as a tail catcher  @xcite .",
    "the barrel section is not currently used as a tail catcher because of the meter - thick solenoid between the hadronic calorimeter and the muon system : this makes matching incoming tracks to hadronic showers correctly much more difficult .",
    "tracks found in the tracking system are extrapolated as helices to the inner surface of the em calorimeters .",
    "every track is supposed to have a seed where the seed is defined as the ` earliest ' cluster in the calorimeters directly connected to the extrapolated track .",
    "when the track has too low momentum to reach em calorimeters , there is no seed found . in this case , the track in the tracking system is used without clustering in the calorimeters .",
    "when the seed of the track is not found due to early decay in the tracking system even though the track reaches em calorimeters , the track is not used to avoid the double counting the energy assuming it deposited its energy somewhere in the calorimeters .",
    "if two tracks are overlapping , it is possible to have the same seed or connected via the showers . in this case",
    ", the two or more tracks are grouped together to compare the energy deposited in the calorimeters with the momenta of these tracks .",
    "the next important step of pfa is the assignment of the calorimeter hits correctly to the charged hadrons .",
    "this also means the efficient discrimination of showers produced by nearby charged and neutral hadrons .",
    "we use a scoring system to add clusters to the shower .",
    "a score is defined by the shower - related geometric quantities in the range from 0 to 1 .",
    "we assign the score to the link between two clusters based on how close two clusters are .",
    "having assigned a score to the link , we build a charged hadron shower starting from seed of the track .",
    "the charged hadron clusters are found and assigned to the shower of the track by searching the highest score link until the energy of clusters found are equal to the momentum of track within a given uncertainty .",
    "we iterate this process by loosening the selection criteria for clusters .",
    "even though electromagnetic showers are well - contained , consisting of a dense , almost needle - like longitudinal core , it has a halo of nearby hits and back - scattering hits for low energy showers .",
    "hadronic showers have clear internal structure and often produce secondary neutral particles which deposit energy far from the main cluster .",
    "we take into account these back - scattering and secondary neutral particles by assigning the clusters in a conical order to the tracks whose energy in the calorimeters do not match the momentum of track measured by the tracking system .",
    "the neutral hadron showers are from the remaining clusters not assigned to any track .",
    "the last step of pfa is to reconstruct the four - momentum of all visible particles in an event .",
    "the four - momentum of charged particles are measured in the tracking system while the energy of photons and neutral hadrons are obtained from the calorimeters assuming that the charged and neutral hadron are pion and kaon , respectively .",
    "all reconstructed particles are filled into a reconstructed particle collection assigned to the event .",
    "muon identification performance has been measured with the benchmark loi samples like @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and standard model ( sm ) background events  @xcite . these have plenty of muons and are used for physics benchmark analyses .",
    "muon identification procedure is done at the first stage in pfa .",
    "when clustering for charged hadron showers , this muon identification can reduce the confusion with charged hadrons by subtracting muon tracks and clusters at the beginning . the minimum momentum to reach endcap and",
    "barrel muon detector is 2 gev and 5 gev , respectively .",
    "the muon identification study in this paper has been performed with tracks higher than 5 gev , to reach either muon detector .",
    "below 5 gev , muons are badly reconstructed so the efficiency and purity are poor .       table  [ table : resolution ] shows the pfa performance is slightly better after muon identification . in this table ,",
    "the performance of the reconstruction is measured by the root - mean - square of the smallest range of reconstructed energies containing 90 % of the events ( rms@xmath11 ) .",
    "this shows that muon identification improves the jet energy resolution overall energy range in the reasonably good muon reconstruction efficiency and purity for above 5 gev . in the future ,",
    "the optimization of each parameter in the algorithm is necessary to improve the resolution .",
