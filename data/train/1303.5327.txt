    "since the mid eighties , the field of quarkonium physics has faced a number of puzzles challenging our understanding of qcd at the interplay between its short- and long - distance domains .",
    "the puzzles related to the quarkonium production at the tevatron have been attributed to the colour - octet mechanism ( com ) , _ i.e. _ the non - perturbative transition of heavy quark - antiquark pairs in colour - octet state into quarkonia ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .    since a few years , we know that @xmath6 and @xmath7 corrections to the colour - singlet mechanism ( csm )  @xcite are essential to try to explain the @xmath8 dependence of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 cross sections observed in high - energy hadron collisions  @xcite .",
    "polarisation predictions are also dramatically affected by qcd corrections , both in the inclusive case and in the production of quarkonia with a prompt photon  @xcite .",
    "as far as the @xmath8-integrated yield is concerned , colour - singlet @xmath10 configurations have been shown to be sufficient - wave decay at nlo , earlier regulated by an ad - hoc binding energy  @xcite , which can however be rigorously cured  @xcite in the more general framework of nrqcd . ] to account for the experimental data  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we reassess the importance of the leading-@xmath11 contribution to @xmath12  _ i.e. _   from the colour - singlet transitions . in the previous analyses of @xmath13",
    "@xcite , these have been disregarded since formally appearing at higher orders in @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , they are not negligible at all .",
    "quotes such as _",
    "`` @xmath16 offers a clean test of the colour - octet contributions '' _ from  @xcite and _ `` if the @xmath13 production is really detected , it would be a solid basis for testing the color - octet mechanism of the nrqcd '' _ from  @xcite are overstated if not misleading .",
    "this observable is not cleaner than the inclusive production for instance .",
    "we have identified two classes of important colour - singlet contributions .",
    "the first comes from the strange - quark  gluon fusion which produces a @xmath17 pair where the charm quark fragments into a @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ diagram - a ] ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the leading-@xmath8 contribution to @xmath18 for instance  @xcite . in the past , @xmath17 has indeed been identified as a probe of the strange quark pdf  @xcite , as @xmath17 , could in principle be discriminated experimentally owing to the presence of an additional charmed hadron in the final state . ] .",
    "the other class is simply a contribution _  la _ vector - meson dominance .",
    "the @xmath19 quarkonium bound - state is simply produced by an off - shell photon ( or @xmath20 ) emitted by the quark which also radiates the @xmath1 boson ( see fig .  [ diagram - b ] ) .",
    "the latter contribution is clearly enhanced in @xmath21 collisions at the tevatron owing to the presence of valence antiquarks in the antiproton , whereas the former contribution is getting larger at lhc energies in @xmath22 collisions thanks to the enhancement of the gluon pdf at lower @xmath23 . in any case , these csm processes are not at all negligible compared to the leading colour - octet contributions ( see fig .",
    "[ diagram - c ] ) .",
    "interestingly , both these born contributions possess a leading-@xmath8 contribution ( @xmath24 ) . not only are they significant at low @xmath8 , but they remain large at large @xmath8 .",
    "this is at variance with the inclusive case where the born contributions are not leading power in @xmath8 .    in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly discuss how we have evaluated the cross sections of the different contributions . in section 3",
    ", we present and discuss our results .",
    "section 4 gathers a detailed discussion of the relative size of the csm contribution via an off - shell _ photon _ w.r.t that of the com via an off - shell _ gluon_. we finally conclude in section 5 .",
    "in the csm  @xcite , the amplitude for the production of a @xmath19 quarkonium @xmath25 of a given momentum @xmath26 and of polarisation @xmath27 accompanied by other partons , noted @xmath28 , and a @xmath1 boson is written as the product of the amplitude to create the corresponding heavy - quark pair , a spin projector @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the radial wave function at the origin in the configuration space .",
    "precisely , one has @xmath31 where one defines @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and where @xmath34,@xmath35 are the heavy - quark spin components and @xmath36 is the projector onto a colour - singlet state .",
    "@xmath29 has a simple expression in the non - relativistic limit : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the quarkonium polarisation vector .",
    "once one sums over the heavy - quark spin components , one obtains traces which can be evaluated in a standard way .",
    "in particular , for lo evaluations without loops one can simply use the framework described in  @xcite based on the tree - level matrix element generator madonia  @xcite .",
    "another possibility would be to use helac - onia  @xcite .    for the cross - section evaluation",
    ", we have used the parameters @xmath39 gev@xmath40 and br@xmath41 . neglecting relativistic corrections ,",
    "one has in the csm , @xmath42 .",
    "we have taken @xmath43  gev and @xmath44 .",
    "the uncertainty bands for the resulting predictions are obtained from the _ combined _ variations of the heavy - quark mass within the range @xmath45 gev , with the factorisation @xmath46 and the renormalisation @xmath47 scales chosen among the couples @xmath48 .    for the colour - octet contributions ,",
    "the only relevant parameter is the nrqcd long distance matrix elements ( ldme ) @xmath49 } ) \\rangle $ ] .",
    "we have set it to @xmath50 gev@xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. _  the value obtained in the recent global nlo analysis of butenschoen and kniehl  @xcite .",
    "this value is also of the order of what was obtained in another recent nlo nrqcd fit  @xcite .",
    "there are of course drawbacks in using ldme obtained from nlo fits .",
    "first , nlo corrections to the hard part of color - octet processes to inclusive production show a @xmath52 factor higher than one which leads to a reduction of the co ldme compared to those extracted from a lo fit . yet ,",
    "a comparison to the nlo results of  @xcite for co channels indicate that our evaluation is reasonable",
    ". moreover , various co contributions can interfere and fits can yield negative values .",
    "for instance , a recent nlo fit has obtained such a negative result for this ldme  @xcite .",
    "it would not make much sense to use such a value in lo computations since the cross section would then be negative .",
    "it is therefore important to recall that our choice is also close to the lo analysis of  @xcite and from analyses which partially took into account qcd corrections @xcite .",
    "our leading - order results for the differential cross sections in @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdpt ] for the tevatron @xmath53 , and for the lhc at @xmath54 tev @xmath55 and @xmath56 tev @xmath57 .",
    "+   +    at the tevatron , the com contribution ( orange band ) is significantly larger than that of the csm via @xmath58 fusion ( dark green band ) .",
    "however , it is of similar size as the csm contribution via @xmath59 ( light blue band ) .",
    "note that the light - blue band actually also contains other electroweak contributions appearing at the same order , _",
    "i.e. _  via @xmath60 , but the yield is strongly dominated by processes via @xmath59 . at lhc energies , the three contributions are of the same order .",
    "the total csm cross section is thus about twice as large as the com one , probably a bit more at 14 tev and at large @xmath8 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dsigdptc ] ) .",
    "such results clearly demonstrate that , contrary to earlier claims in the literature  @xcite , the yield for the production of @xmath0 in association with a @xmath1 boson _ can not _ actually be used as a clean probe of the com .",
    "this remains true over the whole range in @xmath8 .",
    "the born csm contributions considered here are indeed leading @xmath8 at variance to the inclusive case where leading-@xmath8 contributions  @xcite only appear at higher orders in @xmath15 .",
    "+    in addition to the @xmath8 dependence , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdy ] our csm results for the differential cross sections in @xmath61 for the lhc at @xmath54 tev @xmath53 and @xmath56 tev @xmath55 .",
    "one observes that the csm yields via @xmath59 and via @xmath58 fusion are of the same order at the lhc energies , with an increasing proportion of @xmath58 fusion as the energy increases .",
    "as we have seen above , the contributions from the csm via an off - shell photon and from the com via an off - shell gluon namely via a @xmath62}_1 $ ] state are similar , with nearly exactly the same @xmath8 dependence . we have found it instructive to investigate this .    to this end , we have evaluated the cross section for a @xmath63 annihilation into a @xmath19 quarkonium in both channels .",
    "apart from the radiation of the @xmath1 , this is the same process as discussed above .",
    "the partonic cross section for the singlet contribution via an off - shell photon , @xmath64 , is : @xmath65}_{via \\",

    "if the quark line emits a @xmath1 boson , one expects the same ratio up to factors involving the quark ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) electric charges and 2 for the @xmath9 , since the natural scale of the process would then be @xmath83 rather than @xmath84 ; the strong coupling would then be smaller and the electroweak one larger . ] .",
    "this convincingly explains the similarity between the orange ( com ) and light blue ( csm via @xmath59 ) bands on fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdpt ] c ) for instance .",
    "both observations can surely be extended to nlo in @xmath15 and then by using , in a coherent manner , the nrqcd ldme values recently fit in _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite . as we mentioned earlier ,",
    "the ldme values extracted from these recent fits unfortunately depend much on the data sets which were used . from the simple computations done above , it can not therefore be excluded at all that csm contributions via an off - shell photon would in fact be larger than that from com contributions via an off - shell gluons in specific processes , as the ones studied here , where quark ",
    "antiquark annihilation is dominant .",
    "let us emphasise that the partonic process @xmath85 is expected to take over @xmath86 and @xmath87 fusions in inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath9 production at energies close to threshold .",
    "further quantitative statements however require a dedicated survey within the csm in particular in what concerns the feed - down from @xmath88",
    "beside the discussion of the contributions from co and cs channels , there are additional important aspects to keep in mind when comparing the theoretical predictions for @xmath89 to data .",
    "first , experimental analyses of @xmath1 production usually proceed by looking at the @xmath1 leptonic - decay products , in particular @xmath90 .",
    "such events can be tagged by the presence of a missing mass carried by the undetected neutrino .",
    "this however also means that one can not strictly enforce that the invariant mass of the @xmath90 pair equals that of the @xmath1 .",
    "an unexpected consequence of this in the present study is that the ( rare ) 3-body decay , @xmath91 has previously been considered in  @xcite . ] @xmath92 can not be disentangled from genuine @xmath93 events .",
    "in fact , its contribution is not negligible with the typical cuts used at the lhc .",
    "we have indeed found that with the cuts used by atlas  @xcite ( @xmath94 gev , @xmath95 gev , @xmath96 , @xmath97}>40 $ ] gev ) , the process @xmath98 contributes nearly equally to that of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 .",
    "second , atlas has evaluated  @xcite , using the pocket formula @xmath101 , that a significant double - parton - scattering ( dps ) contribution as high as 40 %  is to be expected provided that this formula makes sense and that one can use the effective cross section @xmath102 as extracted from the @xmath103  jets analysis  @xcite .    in principle , the dps signal is reducible since the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 should completely be uncorrelated in @xmath104 and @xmath8 . in practice , since one expects only a handful of events per fb@xmath105 , it will be very complicated to subtract with a good accuracy the sps signal by looking at the @xmath106 or @xmath107 distributions .",
    "third , as for most quarkonium - production observables , feed - down from excited - quarkonium states can be important and proceeds from different partonic reactions .",
    "we have indeed computed that the cross section for @xmath108 times the branching @xmath109 is about @xmath110 times larger than the direct cross section for @xmath89 . in short , the feed - down from @xmath88 is expected to be larger than in the inclusive case and can not be disregarded .",
    "this simply comes from the possibility of a fragmentation contribution at @xmath111 .",
    "summing the direct contribution to the feed - down from @xmath88 and @xmath112 , we find a total cross - section of @xmath113  fb at @xmath114 tev , comparable to the cross - section @xmath115  fb for dps - subtracted prompt @xmath13 recently obtained by the atlas collaboration @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the lo csm contributions to direct @xmath12 are not negligible compared to the contribution arising from co transitions which were previously thought to be dominant .",
    "these csm contributions arise from two sub - processes : a ) the fusion of a gluon and a strange quark which turns into a charm quark by the emission of the @xmath1 , the charm quark subsequently fragments into a @xmath116 pair ; b ) the annihilation of a quark @xmath81 and an antiquark @xmath117 into an off - shell photon , @xmath59 , and a @xmath1 , the @xmath59 subsequently fluctuates into a @xmath0 .",
    "the former process appears at @xmath118 and the latter at @xmath5 compared to @xmath119 for the com process which is however suppressed in the @xmath120 expansion of nrqcd .",
    "we have also noted that , for any @xmath19 quarkonium - production process involving quark ",
    "antiquark annihilation , the csm process via an off - shell photon numerically competes with the com one via an off - shell gluon through a @xmath68}$ ] octet .    finally , owing to the uncertainties on the co ldme , the small rate for this process at the lhc and the possibility for large dps contributions , our conclusion is that the study of direct @xmath89 yields can not serve as a clean probe of the colour - octet mechanism , as previously stated in the literature .",
