    "the standard model of electroweak physics is in good agreement with the data .",

    "the precision of present day experiments even makes it possible to put limits on the higgs mass through its influence in radiative corrections . at the one - loop level ,",
    "such radiative corrections grow logarithmically with the higgs boson mass  @xcite .",
    "fits to the data imply a light higgs boson .",
    "however the situation is not completely satisfactory , as there is difference of about @xmath5 between the two most precise determinations of the effective electroweak mixing angle , @xmath6 i.e. the one based on the measurement of the @xmath7-quark forward - backward asymmetry @xmath8 at lep on one hand , and the one based on measurements of the leptonic asymmetry parameter @xmath9 at sld on the other  @xcite . the value of the higgs mass preferred by the b - quark data is around @xmath10tev , while the leptonic asymmetry data and the @xmath11-boson mass point to a value which is slightly below the lower bound from the direct searches  @xcite . with the recent measurements of the w - mass and top mass from the tevatron",
    "this is well within statistics .",
    "still there is the logical possibility that the higgs boson is very heavy ( @xmath12tev ) and strongly interacting . since the higgs self - coupling grows like @xmath13 higher loop effects can play a role and cancel against the one - loop leading @xmath14 effects . at the two - loop level such radiative corrections",
    "have been calculated , also allowing for anomalous higgs - boson self - couplings  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of these two - loop corrections does not make it possible to fit the data with a heavy higgs boson .",
    "however in a recent paper it was shown that the two - loop correction is accidentally anomalously small and therefore important effects might first appear only at the three - loop level  @xcite .",
    "the situation can only be clarified by an explicit three - loop calculation .",
    "this three - loop calculation for one of the precision variables , the so - called @xmath0-parameter , is the subject of this paper .",
    "the electroweak @xmath0-parameter is a measure of the relative strengths of neutral and charged - current interactions in four - fermion processes at zero momentum transfer  @xcite . after defining the fermi constant @xmath15 by means of the effective interaction that describes muon decay , @xmath16",

    "this relation gets modified by radiative corrections @xmath22 which are sensitive to the existence of heavy particles in the standard model , in particular the top quark and the higgs boson .",
    "the dominant contributions in the large top mass limit come from corrections to the @xmath11 and @xmath19 boson propagators involving @xmath23 and @xmath7-quark loops .",
    "they are proportional to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of loops , and have recently been calculated up to three loops  @xcite .    another limit one can consider is the large higgs mass limit . here , one might expect to find corrections of order @xmath26 , since the @xmath11 and @xmath19 self - energies contain terms of this order , but it turns out that such terms are screened in low energy observables such as the @xmath0-parameter  @xcite .",
    "the leading one - loop terms in @xmath27 depend logarithmically on @xmath28  @xcite , and the leading two - loop correction is proportional to @xmath13  @xcite . in this paper , we present the leading three - loop correction @xmath29 , which is of order @xmath30 .",
    "radiative corrections to four - fermion processes include self - energy corrections to the gauge boson propagators and vertex and box corrections . in principle , all of these can affect @xmath0 and should be taken into account .",
    "however , if the fermion masses are neglected , the higgs boson does not couple directly to the fermions . in this case , the one - loop vertices and boxes do not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "two and three - loop vertices and boxes can only contribute to the leading order term of @xmath29 if they contain one - loop subgraphs of order @xmath13 or two - loop subgraphs of order @xmath30 .",
    "however , it is possible to choose a renormalization scheme in which all terms of order @xmath13 ( @xmath30 ) in the relevant one - loop ( two - loop ) subgraphs are absorbed into the renormalization factors  @xcite . in such a scheme ,",
    "vertices and boxes do not contribute to @xmath27 at the leading order in @xmath28 , and one is left with just the corrections coming from the transversal @xmath11 and @xmath19 self - energies , @xmath31    in section  [ sec : expansion ] , we describe the calculation of the bare three - loop gauge boson self - energies , which we calculate in the full electroweak standard model .",
    "the calculation is simplified by the fact that they are only required at external momentum @xmath32 , which reduces the diagrams involved to vacuum diagrams .",
    "diagrams containing fermion loops are omitted , since after renormalization , they do not give any contributions of order @xmath30 .",
    "we simplify the calculation further by systematically expanding all diagrams in powers of @xmath28 for @xmath33 , using the method of asymptotic expansions  @xcite . in this way",
    ", all terms are factorized into integrals depending only on the large scale @xmath28 on the one hand , times integrals that depend on the small mass scales @xmath34 and @xmath35 on the other .",
    "the factorized expressions are then reduced to a set of independent master integrals using integration by parts identities .",
    "this reduction is performed exactly in @xmath36 dimensions .",
    "higgs tadpole contributions and would - be goldstone boson self - energies , used to determine the renormalization constants , are calculated by the same method",
    ". an attractive feature of this approach is that it enables one to check ward identities and observe cancellations explicitly at the level of master integrals .",
    "the renormalization is discussed in section  [ sec : renorm ] , and the final result is presented in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "all our diagrams are generated by the program qgraf  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the calculation is done mainly in form  @xcite .",
    "for the three - loop one particle irreducible @xmath11 and @xmath19 self - energies , for example , there are 104340 and 82985 diagrams , respectively .",
    "they can be divided into 80 different topologies . after setting the external momentum @xmath32",
    ", the diagrams can be expressed in terms of scalar vacuum integrals .",
    "we use the following notations @xmath37 with @xmath38 + these integrals correspond to the diagrams presented in figure  [ figtopo ] .",
    "in addition to the integrals  ( [ eq : i6])([eq : i1 ] ) , integrals with scalar products @xmath39 in the numerator appear .",
    "in general , the propagators in the diagrams can depend on three different non - zero masses : @xmath28 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the higgs mass also appears in the scalar 3 and 4-point vertices via @xmath40 .",
    "we extract the leading @xmath28 dependent terms by performing an asymptotic large mass expansion , considering @xmath28 to be large and @xmath34 and @xmath35 to be small . here",
    ", we describe the procedure using the language of expansion by regions  @xcite .",
    "the expansion is constructed by considering different regions in loop momentum space , distinguished by the set of propagator momenta which are large or small in those regions . in each region , a taylor expansion of all propagators in the small masses and in the small momenta of that region is performed . typically , the expansion generates extra scalar products of loop momenta in the numerator and higher powers of denominators , as compared to the original diagrams .",
    "however , in each term , the dependence of the integrand on the large and small parameters is factorized .",
    "the resulting expression is then integrated over the whole loop momentum space .    for the three - loop vacuum topology @xmath41 , there are 15 regions in loop momentum space to consider",
    "the region where the momenta in all propagators are large . in this case , the taylor expansion yields three - loop vacuum integrals in which all masses are either zero , or equal to @xmath28 .",
    "six regions where one momentum , e.g. @xmath42 , is small , while the others are large . here",
    ", the taylor expansion leads to products of two - loop vacuum integrals depending on @xmath28 , times one - loop vacuum integrals depending on @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "three regions where the momenta in two non - adjacent propagators , e.g. @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are small , and the momenta in the other propagators are large .",
    "four regions where the momenta in three propagators that are connected to a common vertex , e.g. @xmath42 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , are small , and the momenta in the other propagators are large . in these regions and in the regions of type 3 , the taylor expansion leads to products of one - loop vacuum integrals depending on @xmath28 , times two - loop vacuum integrals depending on @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the region where all momenta are small . in this region , the taylor expansion gives three - loop vacuum integrals depending only on @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these two - scale integrals are the most complicated ones that appear in the expansion .",
    "so far , only a few of the corresponding master integrals have been calculated in the literature  @xcite .",
    "+ not all regions give non - vanishing contributions for all diagrams . in many cases , after the taylor expansion we are left with scale - less integrals , which are zero in dimensional regularization . which regions actually do contribute depends on the distribution of large masses in the diagrams concerned .",
    "for example , in case 2 above , the region where @xmath42 is small only gives a non - vanishing contribution when @xmath46 is a small mass .    obviously , the factorizable integrals coming from regions 2 , 3 and 4 are easy to deal with , since they are simply products of one and two - loop vacuum integrals .",
    "the @xmath41 integrals coming from region 1 can be classified into ten different kinds , according to the distribution of massless and massive denominators they contain . for two of these categories ,",
    "we follow the integration - by - parts  @xcite reduction algorithm obtained by broadhurst  @xcite , to reduce them to master integrals .",
    "reductions for the eight other categories have been indicated by avdeev  @xcite , but here , we prefer to use our own reduction routines . as a cross - check , we have also performed the reduction of these single - scale integrals using the automatic integral reduction package air  @xcite .",
    "the master integrals themselves are known , some in terms of @xmath47 functions , the others as expansions in @xmath48  @xcite .",
