    "the excitation of surface plasmons can cause strong interaction between light and metallic nanoparticles .",
    "these plasmons are hybrid modes of the electromagnetic field and the electron gas and are confined to the surface of the particle .",
    "they give rise to an enhancement of the incident field by several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement enables a variety of applications ranging from the well - established surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers ) , which allows the detection of even a single molecule  @xcite , to the emerging field of plasmonics  @xcite , which has led to prototypes of plasmonic waveguides which effectuate optical energy transfer below the diffraction limit  @xcite ,    a simple realization of a plasmonic waveguide is a chain of metallic spheres .",
    "a surface plasmon mode , typically a dipole mode , of the first sphere of the chain is excited and the scattered field of this first particle excites a surface mode in a sphere nearby and so the excitation can travel through the chain .",
    "there are two crucial points for an efficient transport : the spatial structure of the scattered field in the region of the neighboring sphere must allow for an efficient excitation of the favored mode , and the overlap of the resonances of the bordering spheres has to be big enough .",
    "since any realization of a sphere will deviate from an ideal one , thus introducing random fluctuations , it is important to estimate the typical magnitude of such deviations which still allow for an efficient transport .",
    "therefore a simple and efficient numerical method for approximating the surface modes of the sphere - likes particles is needed .",
    "there are many numerical methods for the determination of the electromagnetic field in the present of nanosized scatterers , like the finite difference time domain approach ( fdtd ) , or so called _ semi  analytical methods _ based on expansions into special function systems like the multiple multipole method ( mmp ) , or the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) , see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews .",
    "essentially , all methods able to calculate the fields also allow to determine the surface modes . for example , in @xcite the dda is used for the determination of the surface modes of nanoparticles , and in @xcite a boundary integral approach is proposed , which focuses on the surface modes , and has been used in @xcite to determine the surface modes of single and coupled spheres , cylinders and cube  like nanoparticles .",
    "here we use a semi - analytical approach based on an expansion of the potentials into spherical harmonics , i.e. , into modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and on the determination of the expansion coefficients by the _ physically motivated _ projection of the boundary conditions onto the modes @xmath0 . see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec .  6 ) for a review of various ways to determine expansions from the boundary conditions in a variety of related problems . for nonspherical particles",
    ", our approach corresponds to an expansion into non ",
    "orthogonal modes and therefore is similar to the usage of the rayleigh hypothesis in the theory of scattering in optics , where the scattered field at a perturbed interface is likewise expanded in the solutions of the scattered field of the unperturbed one  @xcite .",
    "it is known that such expansion methods may fail if the deviations from the ideal geometry become too large , see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein . nonetheless , additional to its simplicity and easy",
    "implementation the distinct advantage of our approach is its computational efficiency for nearly spherical particles .",
    "thus it allows to calculate the surface modes for many realizations of randomly distorted nanospheres and so to statistically characterize their optical responses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the numerical method is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : scheme ] , and validated in sec .",
    "[ sec : exact ] , using the cases of an ellipsoid and of a sphere with certain shape distortions as benchmarks . in sec .",
    "[ sec : random ] we give a statistical study of the optical response of spheres and spheroids with random perturbations .",
    "we are interested in the surface modes of sphere - like nanoparticles , described as some bounded domain @xmath2 , with boundary @xmath3 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to particles that are small compared to the relevant wavelengths and therefore employ the quasi - static approximation . in order to determine their surface modes we consider an excitation from infinity ( described by the potential @xmath4 ) , and calculate the potential inside ( @xmath5 ) and outside ( @xmath6 ) the particle .",
    "these potentials fulfill the laplace equation @xmath7 in addition , the boundary conditions on the surface @xmath3 of the particle are @xmath8 with the outward normal derivative @xmath9 and the permittivity @xmath10 of the particle .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) implies that the particle is surrounded by vacuum , and is homogeneous , isotropic , and non - magnetic ; the dielectric properties are assumed to be local .",
    "there are two different methods to determine the surface modes of a nanoparticle from ( [ eq : lap])-([eq : bc2 ] ) .",
    "the first is to assume that the potential vanishes at infinity , i.e.  to calculate the modes of the particle that can be present without an external excitation . in this case",
    "the problem can be reformulated as an eigenvalue problem with a real _ plasmonic eigenvalue _",
    "@xmath10 for which a nontrivial solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lap])-([eq : bc2 ] ) with @xmath11 exists  @xcite . in this interpretation the variable @xmath10 in ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) is not regarded as the generally complex permittivity of the particle , but rather as a real eigenvalue .",
    "the second method is to study the system ( [ eq : lap])-([eq : bc2 ] ) with an external excitation and thus to regard the @xmath12 in ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) as the complex permittivity @xmath13 of the particle .",
    "the system is then solved for different values of the permittivity and a solution is called a surface mode if the field inside and around the particle is enhanced . if the imaginary part of the permittivity does not vary too much , then the enhanced fields occur when the real part of @xmath12 is equal to a plasmonic eigenvalue .",
    "thus the terms _ plasmonic eigenvalue _ and _ resonant value _ are closely related and will be used interchangeably . in general",
    "there will be a difference in the number of eigenvalues and resonant values .",
    "while there is a infinite number of eigenvalues , the used excitation will choose some of these eigenvalues and only for these an enhanced field will appear .",
    "we study the response of a particle to an external field and assume that the potential at infinity equals the potential of the excitation ; @xmath14 the basic idea is to expand the potential inside and outside the particle into spherical modes which automatically fulfill the laplace equation ( [ eq : lap ] ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 and the familiar spherical harmonics are denoted by @xmath20 : for @xmath21 , the associated legendre polynomials are @xmath22 with the scale factors @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .    from ( [ eq : bc3 ] ) the coefficients",
    "@xmath26 are defined by the excitation potential .",
    "thus it remains to calculate the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 from ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) . in order",
    "to do this we use the following numerical scheme .",
    "first we truncate to @xmath29 such that @xmath30 coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 have to be calculated . to get the required @xmath31 equations we project the boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) onto the modes @xmath32 with degree equal to or less than @xmath33 . in detail , we require @xmath34 this yields a system of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 are matrices which depend only on the geometry of the particle , @xmath37 depends only on the @xmath38 , and @xmath39 contains the unknown coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for a sphere @xmath42 of radius @xmath43 the spherical harmonics @xmath44 are an orthogonal ( orthonormal if @xmath45 ) basis of @xmath46 .",
    "thus , ( [ lsys ] ) decouples in the case of a sphere ( becomes block diagonal , see [ sec : app ] for the precise structure ) and yields @xmath30 _ exact _ solutions of ( [ eq : lap])([eq : bc2 ] ) . for a perturbed sphere the @xmath44",
    "are no longer orthogonal , and the physically motivated idea of projecting onto the modes @xmath47 ( instead of , e.g. , projecting onto the spherical harmonics @xmath44 , which at first might appear more natural ) is as follows : we may expect the fields to be localized near parts of @xmath3 with high curvature , and for perturbations of spheres ( of radius @xmath43 ) these occur most naturally for parts bulging _ out _ ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath48 .",
    "thus , to minimize the error , it appears reasonable to weight the spherical harmonics as test functions in ( [ m1]),([m2 ] ) with @xmath49 .",
    "this also complies with the folklore rule to use the same functions as test functions and as ansatz function . on the other hand",
    ", this rule is rather ambiguous here since we have @xmath30 more ansatz functions , namely @xmath50 .",
    "however , these tend to localize near `` flat '' parts of the perturbed sphere and are therefore less useful as test functions .",
    "we evaluated all three sets of test functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , against available exact solutions for spheroids ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : exact ] ) and found that @xmath54 works best while @xmath55 and even more so @xmath56 yield slower convergence .    as already pointed out in the introduction , expansions like those given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : exp_in ] ) and ( [ eq : exp_out ] ) are conceptually related to the rayleigh hypothesis , and may fail to converge if the deviation of the geometry considered from the ideal geometry is too large .",
    "therefore it is of great importance to test the method against known exact solutions , and to control the error . as shown below , for the present problem it turns out that already moderate @xmath33 yield quite accurate results if the deviations from a sphere are not too large .",
    "the achievable accuracy , however , also depends on the quantities one wants to compute .",
    "we find that typically @xmath57 , which yields @xmath58 , is sufficient to calculate the resonant value of @xmath59 with high accuracy .",
    "the generation of the matrices @xmath60 is the most expensive part of the scheme since each entry requires the evaluation of surface integrals similar to the ones in eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) and  ( [ m2 ] ) .",
    "however , once the matrices @xmath60 are generated , for any given @xmath4 we only need to first calculate the coefficients @xmath38 and then solve some rather small linear system with given @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , the scheme allows for a fast parameter scan when solving the system ( [ lsys ] ) for different @xmath61 , i.e. , when rotating the incident field . for fixed @xmath59",
    "we may also define a t  matrix @xmath62 to obtain @xmath63 .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath38 is quite simple ; for instance , for a constant field in @xmath64-direction the coefficients are @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we use the gnu scientific library  @xcite for the spherical harmonics and the cuba library  @xcite for calculating the projection integrals ( [ m1]),([m2 ] ) .",
    "the linear system ( [ lsys ] ) is then solved with a standard method from lapack  @xcite .",
    "as test cases for our scheme we consider the surface modes of an ellipsoidal particle , for which an exact solution exists @xcite , and the case of a sphere with certain gaussian perturbations .",
    "for the latter we compare our results with the results of a recently developed perturbation - theoretical ansatz  @xcite .",
    "we start with a spheroid , i.e.  an ellipsoid with two identical semi  axes .",
    "the spheroid is oriented such that the two identical axes are along the @xmath70- and @xmath71- axis of the coordinate system .",
    "furthermore , we choose the semi - diameter in @xmath70- and @xmath71- direction as @xmath72 .",
    "thus the geometry of the test case is described by one parameter @xmath73 , the semi  axis in @xmath74-direction .",
    "as the dipole modes of a sphere are excitable by a constant field , and we are interested primarily in dipole - like modes , we use a constant incident field in the test cases .    considering a constant incident field in @xmath74-direction ,",
    "the exact solution for the resonant value of the permittivity @xmath10 is  @xcite @xmath75 with the depolarization coefficient @xmath76 given by @xmath77    numerically we determine the resonances as follows : after calculating the matrices @xmath60 we solve eq .",
    "( [ lsys ] ) for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "this value is chosen because if we approximate the permittivity of gold with a simple drude model  @xcite @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 the permittivity for @xmath81 is about @xmath82 . ] , and define the resonant value as that value of @xmath10 which produces the biggest dipole - like near field , i.e. , we search the value of @xmath12 which maximizes @xmath83 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : reso ] we compare the resonances thus obtained numerically with the exact ones , for different @xmath33 and for two different incident fields .",
    "the results are remarkably good , even for small @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , for an incident field in @xmath74-direction and @xmath84 , for example , the exact result figures as @xmath85 , while the numerical procedure with @xmath86 gives @xmath87 , and differs from the exact result by less than @xmath88 with @xmath57 .",
    "thus , for the calculation of the resonant values our method gives accurate results even with only few spherical harmonics , and even when the shape deviates significantly from that of a sphere .    on the other hand ,",
    "the method is in general not well suited for the calculation of the fields with high accuracy if the deviations from the sphere become large . for illustration ,",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential_ellip ] ( a ) the potentials inside and outside a spheroid with @xmath89 , for an incident field in @xmath74-direction .",
    "the linescan in ( b ) shows that along the particular line indicated in ( a ) the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) , ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) are reasonably well fulfilled for @xmath57 , while the jumps for @xmath86 indicate that in this case @xmath86 is not sufficient , as expected .    from a systematic viewpoint ,",
    "a more relevant basic check of the accuracy of the potentials is the total relative error in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bc1 ] ) , ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbcheck ] we plot the @xmath90norms of these errors , again as functions of @xmath73 and @xmath33 , henceforth denoted by @xmath91 where @xmath92 . for @xmath73 close to @xmath72 , say @xmath93 , we find that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are small and decrease monotonously in @xmath33 .",
    "however , @xmath96 become large rather quickly when @xmath73 falls outside this range .",
    "moreover , they then no longer decay in @xmath33 , which we attribute to a failure analogous to that of the rayleigh hypothesis for such strongly deformed spheres .",
    "similar effects can be observed for various other test particles : the approximation of resonant values of @xmath12 is typically much better than @xmath96 .",
    "thus the performance of the method strongly depends on what one wants to compute . as a rule of thumb",
    "we find that for @xmath97 we obtain very good approximations of the resonant values , and also of the polarizabilities and of the dipole axes , as shown below ; these three observables are the quantities we are mainly interested in .",
    "therefore we have made sure that in all calculations presented below we have @xmath98 .",
    "for the solution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential_ellip ] with @xmath57 we have @xmath95 slightly larger than @xmath99 , so that this solution would be discarded .",
    "another quantity of immediate physical interest is the polarizability @xmath100 which relates the incident field ( @xmath101 ) to the excited dipole moment ( @xmath102 ) . in general",

    "[ fig : alpha1](b ) , which depicts the coefficients @xmath28 for the expansion ( [ eq : exp_out ] ) , shows that the dominant part of the field stems from @xmath107 , but higher spherical harmonics also give non - negligible contributions .",
    "we have also checked our scheme against the exact solution for an ellipsoid with three different semi - diameters , and an incident field that is not oriented along one of the principal axes . again",
    "the agreement between the exact solution @xcite and our results is very good as long as the semi - diameters are not too different .      in sec .",
    "[ sec : random ] we perform a statistical analysis for the surface modes of nanoparticles with a random shape , described by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a scaling factor , dist@xmath110 is the euclidean distance between two points on the unit sphere , one specified by @xmath111 and @xmath112 and the other by @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in these later studies ,",
    "@xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 will be randomly distributed .",
    "thus , the nanoparticles then are spheres with @xmath117 gaussian perturbations with height @xmath115 and width @xmath116 . in order to assess our method for such cases ,",
    "we first consider a particle with three perturbations , study how the resonance is shifted by varying the scaling parameter  @xmath109 , and compare the results with those of a perturbation ansatz for the surface modes of a nanoparticle  @xcite",
    ".    for the perturbation ansatz a geometry close to the given one is needed , for which an exact solution for the surface modes exists . in the following that geometry is called the ideal geometry , and the geometry for which the surface modes are to be calculated is called the perturbed geometry .",
    "it is assumed that the perturbation strength is described by a scalar parameter . in our case",
    "the ideal geometry is the unit sphere and the parameter that characterizes the deviation from the sphere is the scaling amplitude @xmath109 .",

    "@xcite an explicit formula for @xmath120 is presented against which we can compare our numerical results .",

    "there are deviations for larger scaling factors , because these are beyond the scope of the ( first order ) perturbation method .    for @xmath122",
    "more than three resonances occur , notably one with a real part of the permittivity of about @xmath123 . by plotting the potential ( or alternatively inspecting the expansion coefficients @xmath28 )",
    "we find that these modes are shifted and perturbed quadrupole modes of the unperturbed sphere , which due to the perturbations can be excited by a constant field .",
    "for the unperturbed sphere these occur at @xmath124 .",
    "of course these modes are in principle present in all cases , but it depends on the respective geometry if these modes could be excited effectively by a constant field .    to conclude the test of our scheme : already with quite few spherical harmonics ( typically @xmath125 ) , and even if the errors @xmath96 in the boundary conditions are significant , the numerical data for the resonant values and the polariziabilities provided by our method are stable and in remarkable agreement with exact solutions ( if available ) , or with the results of the perturbation ansatz .",
    "we now assume that we are given a set of nominally identical nanospheres which suffer from uncontrolled shape imperfections induced during the fabrication process .",
    "the task then is to characterize the optical properties of this set in a statistical sense .",
    "ideally , one would have at least a good idea how the imperfections are distributed , based on an inspection of a representative number of specimen , then generate a corresponding ensemble , and compute the resonances of each individual member .",
    "since we are not considering any particular case , here we simply assume that the random shape fluctuations correspond to gaussian distortions as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussian ] ) .",
    "we start with @xmath126 , set @xmath127 , and choose randomly distributed @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 with @xmath128 .",
    "the positions of the distortions , described by the angles @xmath111 and @xmath112 , are uniformly distributed on the sphere , @xmath115 is normally distributed with a mean of @xmath129 and a standard deviation of @xmath99 ; the normally distributed widths @xmath116 have a mean value of @xmath130 and a standard deviation of @xmath131 . clearly , perturbations with a negative width @xmath116 are discarded , and we admit only perturbations with @xmath132 in order to avoid sharp peaks . therefore each realization is a sphere with four or less perturbations .    in order to get significant results we generate 1000 realizations of the perturbed sphere , calculate for each realization the matrices @xmath133 , and solve the system of equations ( [ lsys ] ) for 100 different incident fields , i.e.  we consider 100000 cases .",
    "we choose @xmath57 , and require @xmath134 as explained in sec .",
    "[ surf - sec ] , which has resulted in an ensemble with 42829 members .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo](a ) we present a histogram of the resonant values of the real part of the permittivity . here",
    "we count a peak in the absolute value @xmath135 of the polarizability of a particle as a resonance if @xmath135 is at least @xmath99 times the value @xmath136 of a perfect sphere .",
    "@xmath137 denotes the number of the resonances in the corresponding interval of @xmath138 divided by the number of particles . in the following pictures @xmath139 and @xmath140 are defined in an analogous way . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo](a ) the shape fluctuations result in a relatively broad distribution of the resonant values around the unperturbed value @xmath141 , and the maximum is shifted to a slightly bigger value .",
    "not only the position of the resonance is of interest , but also the magnitude of the induced dipole moment .",
    "therefore we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo](b ) a histogram of this magnitude , considering for each ensemble member only the resonance with the largest dipole moment .",
    "due to the fact that the polarizability of a sphere scales with its volume and a typical realization of our perturbed spheres is somewhat bigger than a sphere with radius @xmath72 , we normalize the polarizability to that of a sphere with the same volume as the perturbed one . in the large majority of cases the polarizability of the perturbed sphere is smaller than that of the unperturbed one .",
    "this is due to the fact that for the sphere there are no principal axes .",
    "therefore the polarizability is independent of the direction of the incident field , and for any field the induced dipole moment points into the direction of the incident field .",
    "but if the symmetry of the sphere is destroyed by the perturbations , there are three distinguished principal axes with different resonant values of the permittivity .",
    "so for a fixed permittivity in general only one resonant condition is matched and therefore essentially only the part of the incident field that points into the direction of the corresponding principal axis contributes significantly to the induced dipole moment .",
    "this results in an induced dipole moment which typically is smaller than that of a perfect sphere , and is not parallel to the incident field .    in a plasmonic waveguide , consisting of a chain of metallic nanoparticles , a random angle between the induced dipole moment @xmath142 and the incident field @xmath101 influences an efficient transport , because the near field of one particle should excite the neighboring particle . therefore designing a plasmonic waveguide",
    "requires the knowledge of the spatial structure of the near field .",
    "because a sphere has no principal axes , any arbitrarily small perturbation will pick three axes and therefore affects the orientation of the induced dipole .",
    "thus , with perturbed spheres we may expect that there are only very few cases in which @xmath142 is nearly parallel to @xmath101 . to illustrate this quantitatively , we present histograms of the angle between @xmath142 and @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo_orient ] . in fig",
    "[ fig : histo_orient](a ) we consider all resonances , whereas in fig .  [ fig : histo_orient](b ) only the biggest resonance for every member is used .",
    "the main result is that realizations with @xmath142 nearly parallel to @xmath101 are indeed negligible , and the orientation of the dipole relatively to the external field is nearly random .",
    "this can be seen from the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo_orient](a ) , proportional to @xmath143 , which corresponds to a completely random choice of the orientation of the dipoles .",
    "this figure also illustrates that the only cases which are suppressed when the spheres are perturbed are those in which @xmath142 and @xmath101 are almost perpendicular .",
    "as expected , when only the largest resonances are considered the angle is typically smaller because , as already pointed out , in a resonant situation only that part of the incident field contributes that is parallel to the according dipole axis .",
    "moreover , the distribution of this angle , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo_orient](b ) , is quite broad , which demonstrates the substantial variability in the spatial structure of the field around our perturbed spheres .",
    "therefore , we now consider the surface modes of perturbed _ spheroids_. as spheroids already have at least one distinguished principal axis , we expect that perturbations of a spheroid do not have such a strong effect on the orientation of the induced dipoles .",
    "we employ the same kind of gaussian perturbations , but now the unperturbed particle is a spheroid with semi - axes @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .",

    "[ fig : histo_ellip1 ] we present histograms for the location of the resonances and for the orientation of the induced dipoles .",
    "again the resonances are shifted to somewhat bigger values of the permittivity .",
    "however , now the angle between the incident field and the induced dipole moment for the biggest resonance is much smaller , and also the distribution of the angle is narrower than in the previous case of the perturbed spheres .",
    "this comparison can be roughly quantified by the respective mean values , and the widths of the distributions of the angles .",
    "we focus again on the biggest resonances only , and determine the mean value @xmath150 of the angle and the interval @xmath151 , centered around the mean value , which contains two - thirds of the resonances . for the case of the sphere this results in @xmath152 and @xmath153 $ ] , whereas @xmath154 and @xmath155 $ ] for the case of spheroids .",
    "we have presented a simple - to - implement and efficient numerical scheme for calculating important characteristics for surface modes of sphere - like nanoparticles in the quasistatic limit , based on an expansion of the `` inner '' and `` outer '' potentials into spherical harmonics . although the spherical harmonics do not constitute an orthogonal basis for particles which are not exactly spherical , and therefore encounter problems similar to those connected with the rayleigh hypothesis when the deviation from an exact sphere becomes too strong , they still remain a useful system of functions , in particular so when the boundary conditions are interpreted in an integral manner , with a physically motivated choice of test functions .",
    "we have validated this scheme against exact solutions for ellipsoids , and against perturbation - theoretical calculations for deformed spheres .",
    "these comparisons and also additional intrinsic numerical tests both show that our method is able to yield accurate results for the resonant permittivities and the polariziabilities even when only quite few spherical harmonics are employed , that is , with quite small basis sets .",

    "<S> we develop a numerical method for approximating the surface modes of sphere - like nanoparticles in the quasi - static limit , based on an expansion of ( the angular part of ) the potentials into spherical harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons of the results obtained in this manner with exact solutions and with a perturbation ansatz prove that the scheme is accurate if the shape deviations from a sphere are not too large . </S>",
    "<S> the method allows fast calculations for large numbers of particles , and thus to obtain statistics for nanoparticles with random shape fluctuations . as an application we present some statistics for the distribution of resonances , polariziabilities , and dipole axes for particles with random perturbations </S>"
