    "any conventional amplification process unavoidably introduces quantum noise into the signal @xcite .",
    "however , this can be circumvented by implementing the amplification nondeterministically so that an amplified noiseless output signal occurs randomly @xcite .",
    "noiseless amplification schemes generally rely on applying quantum operations , such as a sequence of single - photon addition and subtraction , to the optical field @xcite . in an experimental implementation ,",
    "the addition and subtraction of photons is typically performed by using single - photon light sources , beam splitters , and photodetectors @xcite , thus leading to nondeterministic amplification .",
    "the noiseless high - fidelity amplification schemes are expected to become an essential tool for quantum communications and metrology , by recovering information transmitted over lossy channels or by enhancing the discrimination between partially overlapping quantum states @xcite .    in this paper , we propose and analyze a noiseless amplification scheme where , in contrast to previous works @xcite , the energy required to amplify the signal does not originate from an external energy source ( i.e. , a single - photon source ) but from the stochastic fluctuations in the field itself . more concretely , the signal is amplified even if no external energy is added to it .",
    "the proposed scheme consists of devices that are frequently used in experiments .",
    "furthermore , as one of the key challenges in nondeterministic quantum optical amplification of light is the small success rate , we also consider improving the success probability .",
    "we start by a short summary of the basic principles of noiseless amplification and the related figures of merit .",
    "this is followed by describing the proposed amplification setup and calculations .",
    "the proposed amplification scheme , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , utilizes the energy fluctuations of the initial field to replace the single - photon source that would otherwise be needed as in the scheme suggested by zavatta _",
    "_ @xcite . in our scheme ,",
    "a similar action is obtained by a configuration where the successful subtraction of a single photon from the initial field by a beam splitter is verified by a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement @xcite , which is followed by adding the photon back to the field by the second beam splitter if no photons are detected at photodetector pd1 .",
    "finally , another photon is subtracted from the field at the third beam splitter , if photodetector pd2 detects a photon .",
    "the final output state resulting from these events is an amplified coherent state with high fidelity when the qnd , pd1 , and pd2 detectors detect 1 , 0 , and 1 photons , respectively .",
    "the action of an ideal noiseless amplifier for coherent states can be described as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the initial coherent field , @xmath2 is the amplified field , and @xmath3 is the gain of amplification .",
    "this operation can not be implemented by deterministic amplifiers , but it can be approximated probabilistically .",
    "it has been shown that the operator @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the annihilation and creation operators of the field , approximates the action of amplification for weak coherent fields with nominal gain @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "so far , we have only discussed the case of successful amplification . for completeness",

    "these single photon processes and the corresponding eight possible output states are described in table [ tbl : states ] .",
    "the output states can be experimentally identified by photon detection measurement outcomes .",
    "the first state is the successfully amplified field and the last row shows the probability that more than one photon is detected by some of the photodetectors .",
    "the fidelities in table [ tbl : states ] clearly show that states from 5 to 8 are exactly coherent .",

    "this further means that at beam splitters 2 and 3 , only single - photon subtraction or no photon subtraction can take place .",
    "both operations result in coherent fields , albeit with reduced amplitude .",
    "this is because the photon subtractions only decrease the amplitude and keep the state coherent since coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xcite .",

    "successful amplification corresponds to the first state . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the amplitude expectation values in table [ tbl : states ] showed that the amplitude of the coherent output states 58 @xmath89 is clearly smaller than the amplitude of the initial field @xmath88 .",
    "this follows from the relatively large reflectivity of @xmath54 . for a smaller reflectivity of @xmath90 , the amplitude expectation value for the exactly coherent output states",
    "is @xmath91 , which is much closer to the initial field amplitude .",
    "since this output is also the most probable output and , in the case of small reflectivities , it is a nearly unchanged coherent state one could also try to repeat the amplification process in order to increase the probability of successful amplification .",
    "however , experimental realization of the repeated amplification setup would be challenging .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied noiseless amplification of coherent signals in a setup where all the energy added to the amplified signal originates from the fluctuations in the quantum field in a purely stochastic manner , i.e. , the field is amplified even when no additional energy is added to the field from external sources in contrast to the previously reported noiseless amplifiers .",
    "we have shown that the probability of successful amplification can be maximized by finding optimal values for the beam splitter reflectivities depending on the desired effective gain .",
    "our results show that the purely stochastic amplification scheme can amplify weak coherent fields with very good fidelities much like the conventional stochastic amplification setups relying on single - photon sources .",
