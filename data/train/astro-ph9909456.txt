    "while it is well understood that the luminosities of o stars are high enough to cause mass loss in the form of radiation - driven winds , it is not so easily understood that the outflows are observed to be both episodically and also periodically or quasi - periodically variable ( kaper & fullerton 1998 ) . by analogy with the slightly cooler",
    "be stars , it might be expected that the winds of the most rapidly rotating o stars would be equatorially concentrated , even if the lower densities and higher velocities were to prevent the formation of equatorial disks .",
    "it is then plausible that the scattering of light from the central star by free electrons in the envelope or in the wind might lead to a measurable polarization if the degree of rotational flattening were sufficient and the orientation favorable .",
    "polarimetric observations are therefore a valuable asset in the study of o - star winds , particularly as an indicator of the geometrical distribution of the outflowing material .",
    "the discovery that most o stars exhibit deep - seated spectroscopic variability ( fullerton , gies , & bolton 1996 ) opened up the tantalizing possibility that photospheric activity may modulate the stellar wind by acting at its base . at nearly the same time",
    ", exploratory observations of o stars with _ iue _ revealed spectral features ( discrete absorption components , or dacs ) accelerating blueward across the profiles of uv resonance lines , as if tracing the outflow of density perturbations in the wind ( prinja & howarth 1986 ) . thus began a series of international multiwavelength observing campaigns extending over several years ( mcdavid 1994 ) , using _",
    "iue _ together with simultaneous high resolution optical spectroscopy , photometry , and polarimetry at various ground - based observatories , in a search for `` the photospheric connection '' : observational evidence that wind variations are directly linked to stellar surface activity . as a sensitive technique for monitoring conditions in the inner wind regions ,",
    "polarimetry had a natural role to play in these observing campaigns , and the purpose of this paper is to presents the results .",
    "some later followup observations are also included .",
    "the program stars and relevant data are listed in table 1 .",
    "tables 210 contain the results of a literature search for observations of each star , followed by new observations which have not been previously published .",
    "the reference codes given in parentheses immediately after the dates of observation are as follows : ( 1 )  mathewson et al .",

    ".    where multiple measurements were available , the normalized stokes parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the degree @xmath4 of polarization , and the equatorial position angle @xmath5 are the means of the given number @xmath6 of individual measurements , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the associated standard deviations .",
    "results are presented for @xmath4 and @xmath5 to help distinguish between variability in the degree of polarization and variability of the position angle , even though these parameters are not normally distributed ( clarke & stewart 1986 ) . for single measurements ( 1 , 2c ) and some cases of only two measurements ( 2a , 2b ) , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are simply representative error estimates , usually based on repeatability of frequent observations of standard stars . in many references",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 were not given , so they were calculated as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for the sake of statistical completeness . in cases where @xmath10 was missing , it was estimated as @xmath14 . the quantities @xmath15 and @xmath16 are estimates of the uncertainty in a single measurement , which are sometimes equivalent to the `` representative error estimates '' mentioned above ( 1,2 ) , sometimes derived from the residuals of the fits used in the data reduction procedure ( 4,5 ) , and sometimes calculated from photon counting statistics ( 3 , 6 ) . for the limber observatory data ( 7 ) a single measurement and its error are the mean and standard deviation of three repetitions",
    "simple inspection of tables 210 is all that is necessary to see that there is no compelling evidence for long - term variable polarization at the 3@xmath17 level for any of the program stars .",
    "the complete data set is far too heterogeneous and the sample sizes far too small to expect any meaningful result from application of a rigorous analysis of variance with f - test probabilities . relaxing the requirements , but still in search of a more quantitative conclusion ,",
    "table 11 was constructed as a statistical summary of the data on all of the program stars .",
    "this was done by calculating the mean and standard deviation of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 over the subsets of observations for each of the stars ( columns 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8) , averaging the standard deviations from each subset ( bracketed quantities in columns 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 ) , and averaging the error estimates for a single observation ( bracketed quantities in columns 10 and 11 ) .",
    "it is then quite clear that the overall scatter @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 from combining individual data subsets is never substantially greater than would be expected on average as seen in , , , and or , alternatively , as seen in and .",
    "the grand averages over all 5 passbands ( in rows beginning with `` gav '' ) , based on the expectation that any variations should appear more or less in all filters , further demonstrate the absence of any detectable variability .",
    "can we use table 11 to make a quantitative statement about the amplitude of genuine variability that would escape detection in this study , as well as an amplitude of variability that would surely be detected ?",
    "a conservative criterion for the break point would be the average of the grand averages of @xmath9 over all the stars in table 11 , which is 0.07% .",
    "smaller variations might be completely hidden , and the threshold for 3@xmath17 detection would be 0.21% . compared to state - of - the - art precision on the order of 0.02% this may seem to be a weak result , but considering that it was obtained from the combination of at least seven different instrumental systems over a span of 40 years , it is a perfectly realistic conclusion that none of the program stars has varied substantially .",
    "this absence of variability constitutes strong evidence that the polarization is predominantly interstellar .    to continue the test for an interstellar origin of the polarization , a serkowski law of the modified form @xmath18 $ ] found by whittet et al .",
    "( 1992 ) was fitted to the @xmath0 data on each star by weighted nonlinear least squares .",
    "the latest limber observatory observations were used because they comprise the most uniform data set .",
    "the top panels of figures 19 show the results , including the fit parameters .",
    "since the best fit values of @xmath19 generally fall within the normal range of 0.45 @xmath20 to 0.8 @xmath20 ( serkowski , methewson , & ford 1975 ) , this experiment can be taken to support the interpretation of the polarization as interstellar .",
    "the middle panels of figures 19 show the polarization of the program star and neighboring stars taken from the agglomeration catalog of heiles ( 1999 ) , superimposed on the _ iras _ 100 @xmath20 survey image , which traces the interstellar dust . in most cases the position angle of the program star is similar to those of its neighbors , as would be expected if all the stars are polarized by selective extinction due to a locally uniform alignment of the interstellar dust grains ( aannestad & greenberg 1983 ) .",
    "the bottom panels of figures 19 show the @xmath0 polarization of the program star plotted as 1@xmath17 confidence ellipses in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "a solid line is drawn through the origin at the average of the @xmath0 position angles .",
    "for comparison , a dashed line is drawn showing the best straight - line fit to the @xmath0 data points .",
    "these two lines will coincide if the position angle of the polarization is independent of wavelength , which is expected if it is purely interstellar .",
    "the shaded region is centered on the mean polarization position angle of the neighboring stars , extended by one standard deviation on either side , and defines the region of agreement between the position angle of the program star and those of the neighboring stars .",
    "the figures clearly show that the solid and dashed lines generally match well , with the greatest differences occurring when the degree of polarization is small and the position angle therefore poorly defined .",
    "in all cases except 19 cep , which has only a negligible mismatch , the solid and dashed lines fall within the shaded regions .    to summarize ,",
    "four arguments imply that the polarization of all 9 program stars is interstellar : ( 1 ) no long - term variability has ever been detected .",
    "( 2 ) the wavelength dependence of the polarization follows a serkowski law typical of interstellar polarization .",
    "( 3 ) the position angle of the polarization is independent of wavelength . ( 4 ) the position angle is consistent with those of neighboring stars .    in spite of this evidence against intrinsic polarization",
    ", it should be mentioned that there have also been some investigations resulting in its favor .",
    "hayes ( 1975 ) made rigorous statistical analyses on his polarization measurements of several o stars with dense monitoring coverage over periods of months and concluded that @xmath22  cep ( hayes 1978 ) and @xmath1  cam ( hayes 1984 ) were variable at the 3@xmath17 level .",
    "he gave convincing proof of instrumental stability to the photon counting limit of @xmath23 0.02% , which justified his detection of variability at levels of 0.06% to 0.08% .",
    "in a later study lupie & nordsieck ( 1987 ) found evidence for spectropolarimetric variability of the same two stars with only a slightly lower level of signal to noise .",
    "as another example of the evidence for intrinsic polarization in emission - line o stars , harries and howarth ( 1996 ) discovered a spectropolarimetric change across the h@xmath1 emission line of @xmath24  pup , which implies a polarizing wind asymmetry .",
    "also , ebbets ( 1981 ) summarized the h@xmath1 emission episodes of @xmath24  oph , which seem to have escaped polarimetric observation but might well have included polarization effects ( reid et al .",
    "the x - ray outburst of @xmath24  ori ( berghfer & schmitt 1994 ) , which was attributed to a propagating wind shock , also escaped polarimetric observation .",
    "most of the program stars were monitored at mcdonald observatory in conjunction with simultaneous ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy during several roughly week - long campaigns from 1986 through 1992 .",
    "these time series are identifiable in tables 210 by entries with large numbers of individual measurements , where only the averages are given . with a typical instrumental uncertainty of about 0.03% for a single observation ,",
    "no polarization variability was detected at the @xmath25 level for any of the series ( mcdavid 1998 ) .",
    "however , during the campaign of october 1991 , both 68  cyg and @xmath26 per showed small - amplitude periodicities in polarization which are a priori significant because they match those found by kaper et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the simultaneous optical and ultraviolet spectra .",
    "these variations constitute evidence for intrinsic polarization of a form that could have very easily escaped detection in the long - term monitoring discussed earlier in this paper , but their reality should be regarded as tentative .    a cleaned fourier periodogram ( roberts , lehar , & dreher 1987 ) of the polarization of 68  cyg using 15 iterations at a gain of 0.9 shows maximum power at 0.75 @xmath27 0.03 @xmath28 ( period 1.33 d ) , equal to the frequency of both the h@xmath1 and equivalent widths .",
    "the amplitude of this variation is about 0.045% ( see figure 10 ) .",
    "interestingly , the polarization is in antiphase with the h@xmath1 ew , exactly as expected in the corotating interaction region ( cir ) model applied to o - star winds ( cranmer & owocki 1996 ) .",
    "the notes in figure 11 give a qualitative plausibility argument for how this might come about . for a thorough theoretical treatment see harries ( 1999 ) .",
    "assuming a radius of @xmath29 and an inclination of 90 , the rotation period of 68  cyg is 2.59 d. this gives two cycles per rotation , also in agreement with the cir model with two diametrically opposite equatorial bright areas .",
    "the case of @xmath26  per is more complicated .",
    "kaper et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found the h@xmath1 and ews to vary with a frequency of 0.50 @xmath27 0.10 @xmath28 ( period 2.0 d ) and also noted the presence of another h@xmath1 frequency at 1.12 @xmath27 0.03 @xmath28 ( period 0.89 d ) , which they interpreted as a harmonic .",
    "as shown in figure 12 , the simultaneous polarimetry shows exactly this frequency , with an amplitude of about 0.025% . assuming a radius of @xmath30 , the rotation period of @xmath26  per is less than about 2.78 d , depending on the inclination .",
    "it is possible , then , that the 2.0 d period is the rotation period , in which case @xmath26  per had only one photospheric bright area and associated cir structure at the time of the observations .",
    "this would result in one ew cycle per rotation , but two polarization cycles , as observed .",
    "this study has illustrated that intrinsic polarization in o stars is clearly a rare phenomenon in spite of the similarity between emission - line o stars and the cooler and less luminous be stars , which have well - known intrinsic polarization .",
    "both classes of stars have significant mass loss in the form of variable winds , but the origin of the variability is still poorly understood .",
    "it seems a likely conclusion that the long - lived flattened envelopes or disks characteristic of be stars almost never form around even the most rapidly rotating o stars because the circumstellar regions of o stars are more completely swept out by their stronger , luminosity - driven winds .",
    "the only indications of variable polarization found in the o stars are weak suggestions of rapid cycles on the time scale of the stellar rotation period ( a few days at most ) which appear to involve wind density patterns that change aspect with rotation .",
    "the o stars presented here deserve continued long - term polarization monitoring for the type of outburst behavior seen in @xmath24 oph and @xmath24 ori",
    ". further pursuit of the suspected rapid cyclic variations , however , is likely to require dense time - series polarimetry of unprecedented precision , with random errors not to exceed 0.01% .",
    "i would like to take this opportunity to thank my friends and coworkers on the `` o - team '' : tom bolton , doug gies , alex fullerton , and huib henrichs , for their enthusiasm and encouragement .",
    "we were all inspired by the work of andy reid and lex kaper , who dispelled some of our skepticism and showed us the value of our observations .",
    "i also appreciate the advice of dietrich baade and ian howarth , who both took the time to read and comment on early versions of this paper .",
    "i am grateful to the administration of mcdonald observatory for generous allotments of observing time , as well as to ed dutchover and the rest of the technical staff for maintaining the breger polarimeter in stable working order for year after year .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",

    "<S> new observations of 9 of the brightest northern o stars have been made with the breger polarimeter ( breger 1979 ) on the 0.9  m telescope at mcdonald observatory and the anypol polarimeter ( mcdavid 1999 ) on the 0.4  m telescope at limber observatory , using the johnson - cousins @xmath0 broadband filter system . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with earlier measurements shows no clearly defined long - term polarization variability . for all 9 stars the wavelength dependence of the degree of polarization in the optical range </S>",
    "<S> can be fit by a normal interstellar polarization law . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization position angles are practically constant with wavelength and are consistent with those of neighboring stars . </S>",
    "<S> thus the simplest conclusion is that the polarization of all the program stars is primarily interstellar .    </S>",
    "<S> the o stars chosen for this study are generally known from ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy to have substantial mass loss rates and variable winds , as well as occasional circumstellar emission . </S>",
    "<S> their lack of intrinsic polarization in comparison with the similar be stars may be explained by the dominance of radiation as a wind driving force due to higher luminosity , which results in lower density and less rotational flattening in the electron scattering inner envelopes where the polarization is produced . </S>",
    "<S> however , time series of polarization measurements taken simultaneously with h@xmath1 and uv spectroscopy during several coordinated multiwavelength campaigns suggest two cases of possible small - amplitude , periodic short - term polarization variability , and therefore intrinsic polarization , which may be correlated with the more widely recognized spectroscopic variations . </S>"
