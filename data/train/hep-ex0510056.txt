    "a charged particle with spin @xmath2 has a magnetic moment @xmath3 ; an anomaly @xmath4 ; and @xmath5 ; where @xmath6 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and the latter expression is what one finds in the particle data tables.@xcite the @xmath7-value is exactly 2 for a point - like fermion in the dirac equation , but radiative corrections give rise to a non - zero value for the anomaly @xmath8 .",
    "the lowest order ( qed ) correction gives @xmath9 . for the muon ,",
    "radiative corrections from qed , virtual hadrons ( quarks ) , and weak gauge bosons are important at the level of measurement.@xcite while the qed and weak contributions can be calculated to the necessary accuracy to compare with experiment , the hadronic contribution needs to be obtained using data from @xmath10 .    in a series of three experiments at cern",
    "the muon anomaly was measured to a relative precision of 7.3 parts per million ( ppm).@xcite experiment e821 at the brookhaven alternating gradient synchrotron improved on this by a factor of 14,@xcite to a relative precision of 0.5  ppm .",
    "while the value of the hadronic contribution has changed over time , the other contributions have remained quite steady.@xcite during all of this , there has remained a discrepancy between theory and experiment of between two and three standard deviations when the hadronic contribution is taken from @xmath11 data . when hadronic @xmath12-decay and cvc theory is used to determine the hadronic contribution ,",
    "the discrepancy is smaller , but there appear to be as yet not understood isospin violation corrections which make it difficult to compare the two methods.@xcite theoretically , the @xmath11 cross - section is what enters into the dispersion integral",
    ". motivated by this potential discrepancy , a new experiment , e969 has been proposed at brookhaven to improve the precision to 0.2  ppm .",
    "the method used in the third cern experiment and the bnl experiment are very similar , save the use of superconducting magnets for the storage ring and inflector , as well as direct muon injection into the storage ring .",
    "these experiments are based on the fact that for @xmath13 the spin precesses faster than the momentum vector when a muon travels transversely to a magnetic field .",
    "the difference frequency between the cyclotron frequency and the muon spin precession frequency , @xmath14 is the frequency with which the spin precesses relative to the momentum , and is proportional to the anomaly , rather than to @xmath7 . with",
    "both an electric and a magnetic field , the spin difference frequency is given by @xmath15 , \\label{eq : tbmt}\\ ] ] which reduces to the simpler equation above in the absence of an electric field .",
    "electric quadrupoles were used for vertical focusing , taking advantage of the `` magic ''  @xmath16 at which an electric field does not contribute to the spin motion relative to the momentum .",
    "a precision measurement of @xmath17 requires precision measurements of the muon spin precession frequency @xmath18 , and the magnetic field , which is expressed as the free - proton precession frequency @xmath19 in the storage ring magnetic field .",
    "these two ( average ) frequencies plus the fundamental constant @xmath20 give the anomaly : @xmath21    the experimental signal is the @xmath22 from @xmath23 decay , detected by lead - scintillating fiber calorimeters .",
    "since the highest energy @xmath22 are correlated with the muon spin , if one counts high - energy @xmath22 as a function of time , one gets an exponential from muon decay modulated by the @xmath24 precession .",
    "the expected form for the positron time spectrum is @xmath25 $ ] , however in analyzing the data it is necessary to take a number of small effects into account.@xcite    the values obtained for @xmath17 by e821 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : amu ] along with one theory value using @xmath11 data for the lowest - order hadronic contribution.@xcite the discrepancy with theory varies between 2.2 and 2.8 standard deviations when using the @xmath11 data for the hadronic contribution , and about one - third of this when using the @xmath12-data .",
    "the improvement of the @xmath11 data , and the understanding of the related theoretical issues is under active study worldwide.@xcite    .",
    "the strong interaction contribution is taken from reference @xcite . ]",
    "to increase the sensitivity of the comparison between theory and experiment , a new collaboration was formed to continue the measurement of 2 at bnl .",
    "the goal is a total error of 0.2  ppm , a factor of 2.5 better than e821 .",
    "this increased precision , combined with the expected improvements in the knowledge of the hadronic contribution should give at least a factor of two reduction in the combined experiment - theory uncertainty when comparing theory with experiment . in september 2004",
    "the new experiment e969@xcite received enthusiastic scientific endorsement by the laboratory .",
    "the funding situation is less clear , and e9669 is expected to be considered by the hepap sub - panel p5 in early 2006 .",
    "e821 achieved a final uncertainty on the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath17 of 0.54  ppm , which is dominated by the statistical error of 0.46  ppm . for our last data set the systematic uncertainties on the knowledge of @xmath26 and @xmath18 were 0.17  ppm and 0.21  ppm respectively , for a total systematic of 0.27  ppm .",
    "a further increase in precision is possible if a higher muon storage rate can be obtained , and the systematic uncertainties present in e821 are reduced .",
    "the proposed 0.2  ppm uncertainty is derived from a 0.14  ppm statistical error , and equal total systematic uncertainties of 0.1  ppm from the measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "ten times more events compared to e821 are needed .",
    "an important feature of the upgraded experiment is a new front - end to the beamline . in e821 pions slightly higher than the magic momentum decay in a fodo decay channel , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : bmline ] .",
    "forward decay @xmath27 were accepted at a momentum slit , but because of the large tail on the @xmath28 distribution , the @xmath29 ratio was about 1:1 . in the new",
    "experiment backward decays in a @xmath28 beam of 5.3 gev / c will be used to produce muons of 3.1 gev , thus eliminating the baseline shifts in the detectors that were caused by the pion `` flash '' at injection . to increase the muon flux ,",
    "we will double the number of quadrupoles in the decay channel , and open the ends of the inflector magnet.@xcite this will gain a factor of four in muon flux .",
    "a number of experimental systems will need to be upgraded for e969 . to handle",
    "the increased rates new segmented detectors and their downstream electronics will be developed .",
    "the magnetic field measurement and control will need to be improved , and the magnet will be shimmed further .",
    "also , the muon kicker will need to be upgraded .",
    "all of these issues are presently under study .    while it is possible to improve the experimental value of @xmath17 further , to below 0.1  ppm , the motiviation for such an improvement would need to be driven by a better understanding of the hadronic contribution .",
    "certainly our upgraded experiment e969 , combined with expected improvements in the knowledge of the hadronic contribution , will present the community with a new , more stringent test of the standard model .",
    "it is clear that interest in our result , and in our ability to improve upon it , remains high .",
