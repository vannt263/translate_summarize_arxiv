    "thus our proposed structural model for the high - pressure phase provides as good a description of the data as the @xmath26 structure at lower pressures .",
    "we note that the visually worse fit of the calculated intensities at 61 gpa at least partly originates from the difficulty of accurately describing the background at very high pressures .",

    "<S> we study the structural evolution of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 as a function of pressure using x - ray diffraction . at a pressure of 54 gpa at room temperature , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a first - order structural phase transition , associated with a change from tetragonal to monoclinic symmetry , and accompanied by a 4% volume collapse . </S>",
    "<S> rietveld refinement of the high - pressure phase reveals a novel modification of the ruddlesden - popper structure , which adopts an altered stacking sequence of the perovskite bilayers . </S>",
    "<S> as the positions of the oxygen atoms could not be reliably refined from the data , we use density functional theory ( local - density approximation+@xmath3+spin orbit ) to optimize the crystal structure , and to elucidate the electronic and magnetic properties of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 at high pressure . in the low - pressure tetragonal phase , we find that the in - plane rotation of the iro@xmath4 octahedra increases with pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations further indicate that a bandwidth - driven insulator - metal transition occurs at @xmath520 gpa , along with a quenching of the magnetic moment . in the high - pressure monoclinic phase , </S>",
    "<S> structural optimization resulted in complex tilting and rotation of the oxygen octahedra , and strongly overlapping @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 bandwidth renders both the spin - orbit coupling and electronic correlations ineffectual in opening an electronic gap , resulting in a robust metallic state for the high - pressure phase of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>"
