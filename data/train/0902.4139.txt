    "the transport properties of low - dimensional strongly correlated electron systems are currently a subject of great interest because of recent experimental observations in quasi - one - dimensional materials and because of their connection to the rapidly evolving field of nonequilibrium physics in strongly correlated quantum systems.@xcite most studies of transport properties in one - dimensional quantum many - body systems have been within the linear response theory.@xcite one fundamental quantity is the drude weight defined as the zero - frequency contribution to the real part of the conductivity .",
    "thus a finite drude weight implies ballistic transport , and it has been proposed as a criterion for distinguishing metallic and insulating phases in a mott transition.@xcite    experiments on quasi - one - dimensional organic conductors@xcite show large deviations from the predictions of band theory .",

    "their exponents are not universal but depend on the strength of the interaction .",

    "recently , the discovery of the colossal magnetic heat transport in spin ladder materials such as ( sr , ca , la)@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath12 , where the magnetic contribution to the total thermal conductivity exceeds the phonon contribution substantially , has sparked interest in transport properties of quasi-1d spin models .",
    "@xcite understanding the transport properties of theoretical models is of great importance for the interpretation of transport or nmr measurements but it is still an open problem for quantum systems involving many coupled degrees of freedom.@xcite therefore , the development of methods for computing transport properties such as the drude weight in strongly correlated systems and the investigation of theses properties are much anticipated .    in this paper",

    "the precise form of @xmath74 is @xmath75    the above spin current operator is different from the one used in spin models .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the spin drude weights defined for an electron system or for a spin system have the same physical meaning because they characterize the response of the spin degrees of freedom to the same external perturbation .",
    "the spin drude weight @xmath60 is thus defined as a precise analog of the charge drude weight @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , a value @xmath76 simply means that the system is an ideal spin conductor , so that the spin transport is not diffusive.@xcite    obviously , charge and spin drude weight are equivalent in the non - interacting electron gas ( @xmath27 ) because the second term of ( [ eq : drude ] ) vanishes . assuming that the low - energy excitation of our model can be expressed by the tll theory , the charge and spin drude weight can be represented by@xcite @xmath77 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the renormalized charge ( spin ) velocity and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the renormalized tll exponent of charge ( spin ) mode . in our model , the renormalized value of @xmath9 is @xmath78 because the system has a su(2 ) spin - symmetry and there is no spin gap in the repulsive parameter region .",
    "thus , @xmath79 . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath59 is more complicated because @xmath6 and @xmath8 depends on the interaction parameters .",
    "a method for calculating the drude weight ( [ eq : drude ] ) with dmrg was introduced several years ago @xcite but has been rarely used until now . in this section",
    "we briefly summarize our implementation of this numerical method and discuss some technical details .",
    "the first term of eq.([eq : drude ] ) can be easily calculated using the ground state dmrg method .",
    "the second - term can be calculated by targeting the correction vector @xmath80 which is solution of @xmath81 the best implementation of this idea is a variational principle similar to the one used for the calculation of dynamical correlation functions.@xcite one considers the functional @xmath82 if the ground state is not degenerate , this functional has a unique minimum for the quantum state which is the solution of  ( [ eq : corvec ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the value of the minimum is related to the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : drude ] ) : @xmath83 our method consists in calculating the ground state and then minimizing this functional with dmrg . note that this approach does not work for systems with a degenerated ground state .",
    "therefore , we always choose appropriate system sizes @xmath84 and numbers of electrons @xmath85 to get a nondegenerate ground state .",
    "another approach for obtaining the drude weight with dmrg is to compute the dynamical current - current correlation function @xmath86 using the dynamical dmrg ( ddmrg ) method.@xcite the imaginary - part of this quantity satisfies @xmath87 which has been previously used to study the optical absorption of various one - dimensional insulators including the extended hubbard model at half filling.@xcite the real part of the correlation function yields @xmath88 which can be expected from the kramers - kronig relation with the f - sum rule of conductivity .",
    "therefore , one can in principle calculate the second - term of ( [ eq : drude ] ) using ddmrg .",
    "however , a dmrg calculation using ( [ eq : var1 ] ) and ( [ eq : var2 ] ) is faster and more accurate than a ddmrg calculation of ( [ eq : ddmrg ] ) and ( [ eq : ddmrg2 ] ) . in the first approach the error in the value of the minimum @xmath89 is of the order of @xmath90 if we can calculate target states with an error of the order @xmath91 within dmrg . with the ddmrg method",
    "the error in the real part of @xmath92 is of the order of @xmath93 ( see the discussion in  refs .  ) .",
    "as originally noted by kohn ,  @xcite the drude weight ( [ eq : drude ] ) can be calculated from the dependence of the ground state energy on the applied field @xmath52 using @xmath94 therefore , one can calculate the drude weight with dmrg using eq.([eq : difdrude ] ) .",
    "this approach has been demonstrated on the spinless fermion model@xcite but it requires treating complex hamiltonians and performing a numerically delicate second derivative of the ground - state energy with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we have chosen the approach based on the variational principle  ( [ eq : var1 ] ) and the equation  ( [ eq : var2 ] ) .",
    "we have carried out dmrg calculations for quarter - filled chains with periodic boundary conditions and lengths up to @xmath95 .",
    "the investigated system lengths are given by @xmath96 with integers @xmath97 so that the number of electrons of each spin ( @xmath98 ) is odd .",

    "( ii ) excepted for the noninteracting point , we observe a difference between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "( this is due to the well - known spin - charge separation , which is a typical property in one - dimensional systems . )",
    "( iii ) the charge drude weight has no linear correction around the noninteracting point @xmath106 at @xmath27 .",
    "( iv ) the charge drude weight is larger than the spin drude weight in the metallic phase .",

    "our dmrg calculation results for @xmath2 can be compared with the exact drude weights @xmath109 obtained from the bethe ansatz solution of the hubbard model@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v00 ] .",
    "relative errors @xmath110 are below @xmath111 for each system size @xmath112 using up to 3000 density - matrix states .",
    "we note that the charge drude weight is larger than the spin drude weight for all @xmath113 in fig .",
    "[ fig : v00 ] . the reduction of both drude weights for finite interactions can be understood qualitatively .",
    "the kinetic energy term @xmath114 in eq.([eq : drude ] ) is maximal for non - interacting electrons ( @xmath27 ) and decreases monotonically when @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) increases .",
    "the second term @xmath115 in eq.([eq : drude ] ) equals 0 at the noninteracting point and can only decrease to negative values for @xmath113 ( or @xmath116 ) .",
    "( note that @xmath115 is not a monotonic function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it has a minimum at finite interactions as it converges to zero in the strong - coupling limit . )",
    "therefore , the decrease of the drude weight is due to both the suppression of the kinetic energy and the appearance of scattering processes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : v00 ] we can see in both our dmrg results and the exact bethe ansatz results that @xmath59 has no linear correction in @xmath0 close to the noninteracting point ( @xmath107 ) , whereas @xmath60 seems to have a linear correction in @xmath0 .",
    "this weak - coupling behavior has already been discussed.@xcite the renormalized value of @xmath9 is always @xmath117 because there is no spin gap for the parameters investigated here .",
    "therefore , the lowest order correction to @xmath60 yields @xmath118 , which is also consistent with the bethe ansatz result.@xcite the behaviour of @xmath8 is more complicated.@xcite there is no first order correction from the interaction @xmath0 and thus if we neglect the irrelevant incommensurate @xmath30-umklapp scattering@xcite and higher order corrections in @xmath0,@xcite @xmath119 . to understand the decrease of @xmath59 , the effect of the irrelevant @xmath30-umklapp scattering has to be taken into account .",
    "this correction is second or higher order in the interaction and explains the non - linear decrease of @xmath59 .",
    "note that , if we neglect the irrelevant @xmath30-umklapp scattering but take higher order corrections in @xmath0 into account ( see ref . ) , @xmath59 increases , which contradicts both our numerical results and the bethe ansatz results .",
    "thus , though those higher order corrections are important for qualitatively understanding the phase diagram of this model , they are not sufficient for a quantitative analysis .    in the strong coupling limit @xmath120",
    "we expect the following behavior : @xmath59 approaches the value @xmath121 because @xmath122 and @xmath123 while @xmath60 goes to 0 because @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , along the @xmath2 line , @xmath59 is larger than @xmath60 in both the @xmath125 and @xmath120 limits and our dmrg results show that this relation holds also for all finite @xmath22 .     and spin drude weight @xmath60 as a function of @xmath1 along the @xmath107 line .",

    "again we clearly see that both drude weights decrease monotonically with increasing interaction and that the spin drude weight is less than the charge drude weight for all @xmath116 . in that case , however , it seems that both drude weights have no linear correction in @xmath1 at the noninteracting point @xmath127 .",
    "this is consistent with the weak - coupling theory which yields no correction to @xmath128 or @xmath7 in first order in @xmath1.@xcite the faster reduction of @xmath60 with increasing @xmath1 is due to the much stronger incoherent scattering processes for spin excitations than for charge excitations , which is demonstrated by the larger second term @xmath115 of eq.([eq : drude ] ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : u00](b ) .",
    "we also find that @xmath126 increases in the luttinger liquid phase ( iii ) with dominant superconducting correlations , which occurs for @xmath129 .",
    "this is an unusual behavior for this  superconducting  phase because @xmath130 for a true superconductor.@xcite in the @xmath131 limit , both drude weights go to zero because the system becomes phase - separated at @xmath132 for @xmath107 .",

    "it is also necessary to discuss the finite - size scaling of the charge drude weight in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition in more detail . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vicvc ] we plot the charge drude weight @xmath150 as a function of inverse system length @xmath161 for @xmath108 and several values of @xmath1 close to the critical value @xmath189 determined in ref .  .",
    "if we perform a polynomial fit in @xmath161 , all results extrapolate to finite values for both phases while an exponential fit is meaningless .",
    "thus from our numerical results alone we would conclude that @xmath59 decreases smoothly as a function of @xmath1 through the critical value @xmath190 determined in ref .   and vanishes only for @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is clearly larger than @xmath193 .",
    "this failure of our finite - size analysis is easy to understand .",
    "obviously , if we assume a scaling behavior @xmath194 in the critical region @xmath195 of the insulating phase and @xmath5 diverges as @xmath196 , we need to treat exponentially large systems to observe the correct finite - size scaling of @xmath150 . therefore , one has to use much larger sizes than the ones used here ( up to @xmath95 ) to determine the phase boundary from the extrapolated charge drude weights .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to obtain accurate results for larger periodic systems using dmrg .",
    "we note that @xmath150 seems to be a convex function of @xmath161 in the metallic phase but a concave function in the insulating phase .",
    "although this finite - size behavior could be used as a criterion to distinguish both phases in principle , it is not reliable generally as it does not hold when @xmath1 is kept fixed and @xmath0 varies through the critical value @xmath197 .",
    "moreover , this is a transient behavior for intermediate values of @xmath161 only as @xmath194 is also a convex function of @xmath161 for large enough @xmath198 in the insulating phase .",
    "the luttinger parameter @xmath8 also extrapolates to a finite value in the insulating phase if the available system sizes are too small.@xcite nevertheless , the direct calculation of @xmath8 from the finite - size scaling of correlation functions allows one to determine the metal - insulator phase boundary very accurately because this approach can be applied for open boundary conditions and thus with dmrg one can simulate systems which are one to two orders of magnitude larger than with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have studied the transport properties of the @xmath199-@xmath0-@xmath1 extended hubbard model at quarter - filling by using the dmrg technique combined with a variational principle for the drude weight .",
    "the contour map of the charge and spin drude weights has been determined in the parameter space of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath0 and nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath1 .",
    "we have found that ( i ) both drude weights decrease monotonically with increasing coulomb repulsion , ( ii ) the charge drude weight is larger than the spin drude weight in the metallic phase ( luttinger liquid ) , ( iii ) the charge drude weight is discontinuous across the kosterlitz - thouless transition from the metallic phase to the cdw insulating phase .",
    "we have also discussed the finite - size scaling and the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit of our numerical data . in the insulating phase",
    "we find a universal relation between the charge gap and the correlation length which controls the exponential decay of finite - size corrections to the charge drude weight .",
    "unfortunately , we reach the conclusion that it is difficult to determine the phase boundary of a metal - insulator transition using the drude weights calculated with dmrg because this approach requires periodic boundary conditions which considerably reduce the performance of dmrg and thus the available system sizes for the finite - size scaling analysis .    we thank s. ejima and s. nishimoto for useful discussions .",
