    "<S> in this work we investigate the consequences of the jaffe and wilczek diquark model in the framework of qcd sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the @xmath0 as @xmath1 state shows that the mass of the pentaquark is compatible with the experimentally measured value . the mass difference between the @xmath2 and the pentaquark with the quantum numbers of the nucleon amounts to 70 mev and is consistent with the interpretation of the @xmath3 as a pentaquark .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , several experiments @xcite have observed a new baryon resonance @xmath0 with positive strangeness . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it requires an @xmath4 and has a minimal quark content of five quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 has the third component of isospin zero and the absence of isospin partners suggests strongly that the @xmath5 is an isosinglet what we also assume in this work </S>",
    "<S> . a puzzling characteristics of the @xmath5 is its narrow width below 15 mev . a suggestive way to explain </S>",
    "<S> the small width is by the assumption of diquark clustering . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of diquarks presents an important concept and has direct phenomenological impact @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the diquark model by jaffe and wilczek @xcite in the framework of qcd sum rules where the @xmath5 is described as bound state of an @xmath4 with two highly correlated @xmath6-diquarks . </S>",
    "<S> the basis of the sum rules was laid in @xcite and their extension to baryons was developed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the assumptions of the model are incorporated by an appropriate current . </S>",
    "<S> since the sum rules are directly based on qcd and keep the analytic dependence on the input parameters , they can help to differentiate between the models and to test their features . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of the diquark picture within the context of the sum rules was shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several sum rule investigations for the pentaquark already exist @xcite which , however , are based on different models or currents . </S>",
    "<S> the diquark models for the pentaquark have also been investigated within other approaches @xcite .    in the model by jaffe and wilczek the @xmath6-diquarks have zero spin and are in a @xmath7 and @xmath8 representation of colour and flavour . in order to combine with the antiquark into a colour singlet </S>",
    "<S> , the two diquarks must combine into a colour 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the diquark - diquark wavefunction is antisymmetric and has angular momentum one . </S>",
    "<S> this combines with the spin of the @xmath4 to total angular momentum 1/2 and results in positive parity . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested to interpret the roper resonance @xmath3 as @xmath9 pentaquark state and we will study this resonance at the end of our analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic object in our sum rule analysis is the two - point correlation function @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the interpolating field of the pentaquark under investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> the diquarks have a particularly strong attraction in the flavour antisymmetric @xmath12 channel . </S>",
    "<S> thus the current contains two diquarks of the form @xmath13(x)\\,.\\ ] ] @xmath14 denotes the charge conjugation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the two diquarks must be in a @xmath15-wave to satisfy bose statistics . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the current contains a derivative to generate one unit of angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the diquarks couple to a @xmath16 in colour to form the current @xmath17\\gamma_5 \\gamma_\\mu c \\bar{s}_e^t\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the covariant derivative for the @xmath7 is given by @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parity is positive . </S>",
    "<S> this current has a different structure than the currents in other pentaquark sum rules @xcite which contain no derivative to produce the angular momentum between the diquarks . inserting the current and neglecting higher orders in the strong coupling constant the correlator </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath19   t_{\\mu\\nu}^{ee'}(x)\\ , ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 represents the strange quark propagator . </S>",
    "<S> the quark propagator has been evaluated in the presence of quark and gluon condensates in @xcite , where the explicit expressions can be found . using the following lorentz decomposition for @xmath21 , @xmath22 the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> can be determined up to operators of dimension 6 @xcite . in momentum space </S>",
    "<S> the correlator can be parametrised as @xmath25 to obtain the phenomenological side we insert intermediate baryon states with the corresponding quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> since no experimental information on higher pentaquark states is available we make the assumption of quark - hadron duality and approximate the higher states by the perturbative spectral density above a threshold @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the uncertainty on @xmath26 will be one of the dominant errors in the sum rule analysis .    in order to suppress the higher dimensional condensates and to reduce the influence of the higher resonances we employ a borel transformation with borel parameter @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> as in @xcite we now concentrate on the chirality even part @xmath28 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : momcorr ] ) which contains the leading order term from the operator product expansion . transferring the continuum contribution to the theoretical side and taking a logarithmic derivative with respect to @xmath29 , one obtains the sum rule for the mass of the pentaquark , @xmath30 where @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> a basic input for the sum rule analysis is the borel parameter @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a sum rule window of @xmath32 where the operator product expansion converges well and the phenomenological continuum is not too large . for the continuum threshold we use a central value of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the continuum starts 350 mev above the measured pentaquark mass . </S>",
    "<S> this difference should roughly correspond to one radial excitation @xcite and represents a typical value for sum rule analyses with light quarks as degrees of freedom @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 as a function of the borel parameter @xmath35 for different @xmath36 ( solid ) , @xmath37 ( dotted ) and @xmath38 ( dashed ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] shows the mass as a function of the borel parameter @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule has a good stability with respect to @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> as central value for the pentaquark mass we obtain @xmath39 . to estimate the error on @xmath34 we vary @xmath26 between @xmath40 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] we have also plotted the change of @xmath34 with the continuum threshold from which we obtain an error of @xmath41 . to estimate the dependence of the sum rules on the ope we successively remove the different orders . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the higher condensates lowers the mass . </S>",
    "<S> the four - dimensional condensates lower the leading order result by about 50 mev and the condensates of dimension 6 by another 50 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that a reasonable error estimate from the ope would be @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , contributions to the error also arise from the other input parameters which we vary in the ranges presented above . </S>",
    "<S> as it turns out , their influence on the value of @xmath34 is small compared to the errors from the continuum threshold and the convergence of the ope . adding the errors quadratically our final result reads @xmath43 in @xcite jaffe and wilczek suggested to interpret the roper resonance as @xmath9 pentaquark state . </S>",
    "<S> one can then perform a similar analysis for the @xmath3 as has been done for the @xmath5 by substituting the @xmath4 antiquark by a @xmath44 antiquark . as central value for the continuum threshold we choose , as in the @xmath2 case , a value of 350 mev above the ground state mass . for the error range we use @xmath45 . performing a sum rule analysis for the @xmath46 with the above given parameters </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a mass of @xmath47 .     </S>",
    "<S> mass difference @xmath48 for different values of the continuum threshold , the solid , dashed and dotted lines are for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> similar as it has been done in @xcite , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] we plot the mass difference @xmath48 for different values of the continuum thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> the mass splitting between the pentaquark states comes out to be about 70 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the error represented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] is based on the assumption that the continuum thresholds have the same offset for both pentaquark states . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenologically , these values can be different and one should add to the error a part of the uncertainty from @xmath26 given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus the error can easily amount to 50 mev . </S>",
    "<S> though the mass difference is consistent with the interpretation of the @xmath3 as a pentaquark , the uncertainty remains large and a reduction of the error would be essential to clarify the situation .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarise , we have performed a qcd analysis based on the approach by jaffe and wilczek . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a sum rule that is stable over the borel parameter @xmath27 and reproduces the mass of the pentaquark within errors . we have also performed an analysis for the pentaquark with the quantum numbers of the nucleon and have shown that the interpretation of the roper resonance @xmath3 as @xmath9 pentaquark state is consistent with the sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the sum rules are directly based on qcd and thus , apart from the structure of the current , do not contain further model assumptions </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to see if lattice calculations could confirm these findings . </S>",
    "<S> first lattice calculations exist @xcite which , however , are based on different interpolating currents and whose results are not yet conclusive . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison and discussion can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully , future experimental and theoretical investigations could further clarify and explore the pentaquark states and the consequences of the different models . </S>"
