    "a high temperature stability is achieved , that reduces mixer gain variation , and returns better data quality with less baseline features such as standing waves and baseline distortions .",
    "however , at the shorter wavelengths of the hot electron bolometer ( heb ) mixers , data quality was at times poor due to system instability @xcite .    in anticipation of this unique environment ambitious calibration accuracies were sought , with a baseline calibration uncertainty of 10% and a goal calibration uncertainty of 3% @xcite .",
    "the main sources of calibration error inherent to a double sideband heterodyne system were determined to be the sideband ratio ( hereafter sbr ) , standing waves , and the calibration load coupling .",

    "a discussion section follows summarizing the lessons learned from this calibration effort .",
    "the hifi mixers are double sideband ( dsb ) mixers which detect signals in an upper ( usb ) and lower ( lsb ) sideband simultaneously as the mixing process does not distinguish between positive and negative differences between sky frequency and lo frequency .",
    "the width of this sideband is the mixer if ( intermediate frequency ) bandwidth ( bw ) which is dependent on the mixer design , see table [ mixer_overview ] .",
    "the detected signal is calibrated using the two - load calibration @xcite .",
    "this method requires the observation of a reference blank sky position , together with internal hot and cold sources .",
    "since the temperature of the hot and cold loads and their coupling to the mixers are known , one can assign an intensity to the sky signal . using this method one can determine the double sideband intensity of the detected signal . to accurately assign an intensity to a given spectral channel in a given sideband",
    "one must have an _ a priori _ knowledge of the fraction of the double sideband signal that belongs to the respective upper and lower sideband at a given lo frequency .",
    "this fraction is known as the _ sideband ratio_.    the sideband ratio , @xmath6 , is the ratio of one sideband gain over the other and defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the response in the usb and @xmath9 is the response in the lsb .",
    "the total instrument response , @xmath10 , is then : @xmath11 in the hifi data processing pipeline a dedicated pipeline step dosidebandgain converts the double sideband intensity into separate upper and lower sideband intensities @xcite . in this step",
    "the dsb spectra is divided by the _ normalized _ sideband ratio , @xmath12 , to return the upper sideband intensity , and independently divided by the factor @xmath13 to return the lower sideband intensity .",
    "the normalized upper sideband gain is related to the sideband ratio , @xmath6 , as follows : @xmath14 @xmath12 describes what fraction of the total double sideband response stems from the upper sideband .",
    "then following from equation [ dsb_total ] , @xmath13 is the fraction of that dsb response that comes from the lower sideband .    in an ideal double sideband heterodyne receiver",
    "both sidebands have equal gain and hence @xmath12 is 0.5 .",
    "this is the base assumption for hifi ; however , as we will see in the following sections , the sideband ratio can vary considerably over a mixer band .",
    "the degree of sideband imbalance is mainly driven by the variation of the mixer broadband coupling .",
    "this coupling was measured for all hifi mixers prior to flight using an fts . for this test ,",
    "the fts is coupled to the mixer and swept in order to extract the mixer output power at each frequency , and derive the mixer broadband coupling .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the fts measurements are taken with the mixer biased to be sensitive to direct detection and not in heterodyne mode ( i.e. the mixer is not _ pumped _ by an lo source ) .",
    "[ fts_coupling ] provides an overview of the coupling measured for each hifi mixer .",
    "it shows that mixers 1 - 4 have large variations in coupling compared to mixers 5 - 7 .",
    "the reasons for this vary .",
    "mixers 3 and 4 were measured with the same experimental setup and were both affected by a non optimum cryostat window which introduced a large standing wave into the measured data .",
    "bands 1 and 2 were taken under better conditions and provide a clearer picture of this coupling .",
    "bands 5 - 7 show less frequency variation which is likely due to the coupling structure or mixer technology .",

    "[ fts_sbr_example ] shows an example of the variation in upper and lower sideband gain and the resulting sideband ratios in the hifi band 2 for 3 different lo frequencies .",
    "the effect is most prominent in regions where there is a large slope in the broadband coupling . in these regions , such as the band edges , one sideband is dominant over the other . at the lower band edge",
    "e.g. the lsb coupling is less than the usb one and hence we have a normalized sideband ratio , @xmath12 , higher than 0.5 .",
    "the opposite effect is seen at 750ghz where the usb coupling is weaker than that of the lsb and hence @xmath12 is less than 0.5 . in regions , such as at 665 ghz , where the coupling is equal in both sidebands",
    "we have a balanced sideband gain scenario , but still a small slope in the gain is seen over the if bandwidth .    returning to fig . [ fts_coupling ]",
    "one can expect that mixers 57 have less sideband ratio imbalance since the broadband coupling varies slowly with sky frequency compared with bands 14 . also from the fig .",
    "[ fts_sbr_example ] it should be noted that the sideband ratio is more extreme towards higher if s since these regions are at the maximum frequency separation and so are more sensitive to slopes in broadband coupling . since the heb mixers have a lower if than the sis mixers , they are less sensitive to sideband ratio imbalances .",

    "this is similar to the level 1 data from the hifi data processing pipeline@xcite .",
    "this difference in double sideband and single sideband intensity is a result of the calibration process .",
    "since the data are intensity calibrated by observing a hot and cold load the final spectrum is a fraction of the difference of their signals .",
    "since the internal loads provide broadband signals and contribute to both sidebands a nearly equal continuum emission , a spectral line signal observed in only one sideband is calibrated as approximatively half the intensity it has in reality .",

    "where the sideband ratio is 0.5 the lines have equal intensities and are half the original ssb intensities .",

    "the advantage of the martin - puplett diplexer is that the amount of lo power reaching the mixer at the correct polarization angle can be maximised .",

    "the slope in line intensity induced by a diplexer mistune is noticeably across the if band .",
    "these effects were seen in the band 3 and 4 gas cell test data , and are particularly noticeable in saturated h@xmath2o lines where the broad and flat saturated line plateau had a significant slope indicating a diplexer mistune@xcite .",
    "this diplexer mistune introduced an additional uncertainty into the sideband ratio derived from the gas cell tests .",
    "fortunately these diplexer tuning effects have not been observed in flight , as a new and improved diplexer tuning model was generated based on the ground testing experience .",
    "investigation of @xmath16co ( 8 - 7 ) transition in orbit shows no evidence of the variation shown in fig .",
    "[ mis_tuned_diplexer_12co ] .",
    "however , further data mining is required for a firm confirmation that we have no diplexer induced sideband ratio effect due to mistuning .",
    "in addition to the diplexer mistuning possibilities , the diplexer can also introduce complicated standing wave patterns .",
    "this was investigated by @xcite using a band 2 prototype mixer .",
    "they showed that there can be significant standing waves issues at the if band edges , which modulate the line intensity . @xcite",
    "have underpinned the experimental work with a theoretical frame work . due to the coarse frequency sampling of the standard spectral scan used during the hifi observations , it is difficult to measure the influence of standing waves .",
    "however , a number of dedicated tests were undertaken towards the end of the mission in order to measure the influence of this effect .",
    "these tests involved placing a spectral line towards the if band edges and observing the line at different lo frequencies separated by tens of mhz and different diplexer mistunings .",
    "these tests will help established the degree of scatter due to standing waves and diplexer mistuning .",
    "it has been demonstrated that some frequency areas over the hifi tuning range are affected by spectral impurity .",
    "what this means is that the dsb spectrum obtained from the mixing process may hold signal arising from frequency ranges not belonging to the intended ones .",
    "in this situation , the detector gain can not be described with only 2 components ( lsb and usb ) but has to take into account an additional component ( the outer sideband contribution , osb ) . in practice",
    "this implies that the total system gain is altered by that of the unwanted regions and the line calibration becomes erroneous as it assumes a sideband correction relying on only two sidebands .",
    "one can extend the formalism introduced in equations [ dsb_total ] and [ g_ssb_equation ] as follows . assuming that the osb contributes to the total gain as @xmath17 , the new sideband gain ratio correction to apply to lines from the usb writes",

    "the most severe impure region was identified in band 5b , which was in fact only released to the observer community after most of its purity issues got resolved .",
    "evidence of the sideband ratio imbalance in this band can be seen in the gas cell tests shown in fig .",
    "[ gascell_sbr_overview ] . in this example",

    "the test apparatus is discussed in detail in @xcite , while the data acquisition and process of extracting the sideband ratio from the gas cell test data is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the hifi gas cell was designed to present a saturated column of @xmath16co , @xmath24co , ocs and h@xmath2o gas to the instrument detectors . by measuring these gases at various lo frequencies a sparsely sampled picture of the sideband ratio",

    "there are , however , several limitations to this exercise : while the band 3 and 4 fts measurements were affected by the fts setup problems mentioned in section [ fts ] , the gas cell test data shown for band 5 was affected by an impure lo signal ( discussed in section [ lo_purity ] ) . furthermore , the large scatter in the gas cell test data seen in bands 6 and 7 is due to poor data quality during the ground test campaign , see section [ sect_heb ] and @xcite for further details .",
    "this leaves bands 1 and 2 with the best combination of good fts and gas cell test data .",

[ fts_sbr_slices ] would correspond to a vertical slice of the gray fts measurement region . from the plots there is some agreement between the fts measurement and the sideband ratio inferred from the gas cell tests , in particular in the lower end of band 2a and upper end of band 1b , i.e. those areas mapping the expected drop in the mixer response towards the band edge .",
    "however , the regions associated with both @xmath16co transitions at 576 and 691ghz can not be reconciled in the two datasets .    in the following sections we show that several of the regions of sideband ratio imbalance predicted by the gas cell tests are also seen in the flight data , which leads to the conclusion that the gas cell measurements should be more representative of the actual sideband ratio affecting the science data .",
    "we recall that the fts measurements are performed with an un - pumped mixer , so there could be additional mechanisms other than what the fts broadband coupling measurement can reveal , such as an lo frequency dependent heterodyne if conversion efficiency .",
    "some regions of sideband ratio indeed show extreme effects that contradict the assumptions made so far in this paper .",
    "the @xmath16co ( 5 - 4 ) region in band 1 for example ( see section [ 12co_54 ] ) shows a sideband ratio that increases towards lower if s in both sidebands , which is opposite to the behaviour shown in the leftmost example of fig .",

    "we see the sideband ratio extracted using three different molecules , h@xmath2o , @xmath16co and ocs . from the figures one can see that depending on which lo frequency the @xmath16co line is measured at there is a noticeable change in sideband ratio and therefore line intensity . unfortunately the @xmath16co ( 5 - 4 ) transition was only measured in the upper sideband in the gas cell tests .",
    "we can , however , use flight data from the upper and lower sideband and extrapolate the sideband ratio measured during the gas cell tests from the upper sideband into the lower sideband .",

    "[ chess_line_int ] indeed shows that there is a similar if - dependent trend in the lower sideband as the line intensity is seen to increase towards lower if ( points at negative if ) . using the gas cell measurements of the upper sideband behaviour of the @xmath16co line in combination with the spectral scan data it is possible to extrapolate the sideband ratio into the region where the @xmath16co transition is in the lower sideband ( lo frequencies between 580 - 584ghz ) .",
    "the extrapolation is undertaken by correcting the upper sideband line with the correct sideband ratio . in the example",
    "shown the sideband corrected peak line intensity is estimated to be 13.5k for the h mixer and 13k for the v mixer . using this intensity as a reference , the lower sideband ratio in the 580 - 584 ghz can be derived .",

    "therefore , we believe that the sideband ratio measured during the gas cell tests in the hifi bands 6 and 7 is not representative of the true mixer response in those bands and should be ignored for future error budgets .",
    "further data mining will be undertaken during the post operation period to confirm that the sideband ratio across the heb bands is 0.5 .",
    "all evidence so far supports this assumption .",
    "[ sect_heb ]",
    "the gas cell test campaign provided thousands of measurement points prior to the launch of herschel , building probably one of the largest dataset dedicated to the calibration of the sideband ratio in a double sideband receiver , and demonstrating the unique capabilities of hifi as a high - resolution spectrometer already years before the herschel launch . yet , more than half a year after the mission completion the sideband ratio correction is still puzzling in several areas of the hifi frequency range .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is the relative scarcity of measurement points that was inherent to the limited number of gases available for the gas cell tests .",
    "this frequency coverage granularity later proved to be insufficient in bands such as band 1 or 2 where steep sideband ratio variations have been confirmed to occur over relatively narrow frequency domains .",
    "the best way to join the dots between the pre - launch measurement points is to make use of high signal - to - noise spectral sweeps that can provide relative variation of line intensities within frequency steps of a few hundred mhz . the combination of the absolute sideband ratio points derived from the gas cell tests , and their relative evolution in flight data is therefore needed to derive the detailed structure of the gain profile over the whole hifi range .",
    "this approach was considered before launch already when a full spectral scan of the methanol molecule was collected in the laboratory .",
    "while this dataset probably contains most of the answers we are after , it is to date still too complex to interpret due to often non - mature spectroscopic parameters ( e.g. pressure broadening ) for methanol , which is a mandatory input for a correct modelling of the molecular absorption ( most of it is non - saturated ) as a function of the frequency .",
    "we note that part of the complexity uncovered in e.g. band 1 was not anticipated , even during the design of the mixer circuits . from the early fts measurements of the mixer broadband coupling , it was unclear that significant variations of the sideband ratio over frequency ranges as narrow as 4 ghz , such as the one evidenced e.g. around the @xmath16co 5 - 4 line ( fig .",
    "[ 12co_54_plot ] ) , would apply to the mixer response . in hindsight",
    "ocs measurements on a finer lo frequency grid would have helped unravel the coupling profile of bands 1 and 2 .",
    "it is still unclear whether the discrepancy between those fts measurements and the gas cell test data is simply due to the fact that the fts tests did not use pumped mixers .",
    "we suggest that this discrepancy could be further investigated by groups involved in heterodyne detector design .",
    "one of the important questions for the astronomers is , what is the final absolute accuracy of the line intensity observed , which for hifi often boils down to the contribution of the sideband ratio .",
    "because the sideband ratio is currently assumed to be constant over most of the tuning range , the same is true for its accuracy , which is simply taken as the standard deviation of the sideband gains derived from the gas cell tests over a given band .",
    "we discussed in section  [ sect_heb ] that this is too pessimistic e.g. for the heb bands . on top of that ,",
    "our description of the sideband ratio is lo- and if - dependent , hence the calibration accuracy should be treated accordingly .",
    "other aspects of the sideband ratio calibration , such as standing wave and/or diplexer cross - talk ( not discussed in detail in this paper ) , are too complex to measure at such granularity .",
    "this is where the need of a detailed instrument model becomes important , and such work is currently on - going within the hifi team @xcite .",
    "it is unrealistic to assume that a theoretical model could accurately predict the frequency - dependent sideband ratio profile at any given lo frequency , so the idea here is not to correct observational data by synthetic instrument response function .",
    "rather , such a model should provide the order of magnitude of typical calibration errors resulting from optical effects such as standing waves , esp . in the diplexer bands .",
    "an important lesson from the sideband ratio calibration effort is that a large fraction of the answers can be directly extracted from the science data themselves . while the gas cell test campaign offered measurement conditions with a fully controlled sky signal input , it was relatively constrained in time and performed at a moment when the instrument understanding was not fully mature , so some of the data peculiarities where still uncovered or not accounted for at the time .",
    "the regular science observations gathered over the almost four years of mission provide the complementary information that not only allows to revisit some of the laboratory data , but also to probe the instrument behaviour in an often larger variety of parameter space than could be considered pre - launch .",
    "the combination of the two is the key to build the most accurate picture of the receiver characteristics , and offer the best possible calibration to the legacy archive data .    in that respect ,",
    "the main source of information lies in the so - called spectral surveys , where a given spectral range is observed several times at nearby lo frequency tunings .",
    "this redundancy allows to invert the double sideband problem and build a single sideband solution - this is called _ deconvolution _ @xcite . in this process",
    ", the gains applying respectively to the lsb and usb can be fitted in order to reconcile all individual dsb spectra with the ssb solution .",
    "intrinsically the sideband gain profile inferred from this algorithm is only relative and needs to be tied to absolute values measured somewhere else ( typically during the gas cell tests ) .",
    "the quality of the recovered sideband gain profile depends on the line density ( if it is too large the risk of line blend is high , if it is too low the problem becomes degenerated at some frequencies ) .",
    "the hifi team is currently running simulations on synthetic data with a variety of user - fed sideband ratio models and line density to identify the best data - set of spectral surveys to be used for that purpose , together with the accuracy associated with such an approach .",
    "the goal will be to extract an as continuous as possible profile of the sideband ratio over the hifi observational range . until then",
    ", the recommendation is to use the sideband ratio measured at particular line frequencies during the gas cell test campaign .",
    "this information , along with the calibration uncertainty associated with the sideband ratio , is communicated via the technical note@xcite found on the hifi calibration webpages .",
    "we would like to thank mihkel kama from the chess team for his help in investigating the sideband ratio effect around the 557 ghz water line .",
    "ronan higgins would like to thank netty honingh for useful discussions on the origins of the sideband ratio imbalance in bands 1 and 2 .",
