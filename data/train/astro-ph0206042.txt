    "globular star clusters have remarkably simple structures that are well approximated by isotropic , single - mass @xcite models . in the multi - dimensional space of all their structural quantities such as scale radii , central concentration , surface brightness , velocity dispersion , mass - to - light ratio , and so forth , it is striking that real globular clusters in the milky way inhabit only a narrow region referred to as the fundamental plane ( fp ; see * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite has shown that a particularly simple way of expressing the fp is to note that any king model is completely specified by four input parameters such as total cluster luminosity @xmath3 , central concentration @xmath4 log @xmath5 , mass - to - light ratio , and binding energy @xmath2 .",
    "adding in the two strong empirical constraints that @xmath6 const and @xmath7 then requires the clusters to lie on a two - dimensional slice of this 4-space , leaving only two quantities ( @xmath8 and @xmath3 ) to determine the residual scatter on this fp . in turn , the concentration @xmath8 is correlated with @xmath3 , leaving the remarkable result that the structures of these clusters are fixed largely by just one major _ internal _ parameter , their total mass ( or luminosity , at a given age ) .",
    "the _ external _ environment , i.e.  its location in the galactic tidal field , also has some influence on the fp parameters .",
    "however , clusters may have formed under drastically different environmental conditions in other galactic environments ( giant and dwarf ellipticals , starburst systems , galactic bulges and rings , etc . ) .",
    "the structures of clusters in these other types of galaxies remain to be investigated . the only other large galaxy for which this kind of study has been carried out in detail is m31 , a large disk galaxy much like the milky way , and perhaps not surprisingly , its globular clusters strongly resemble those of the milky way @xcite .    beyond the local group ,",
    "the nearest large galaxy containing many globular clusters available for detailed measurement is ngc 5128 , the giant elliptical at the center of the centaurus group at a distance @xmath9 mpc .",
    "more importantly , it is a very different type of galaxy than any in the local group , and quantitative study of its clusters holds considerable promise for adding constraints to formation modelling .",
    "in addition , a point of special interest from the viewpoint of globular cluster structural studies is that , because of sheer population size , ngc 5128 has many clusters at the upper end of the globular cluster mass distribution ( @xmath10 ) ; with a total population of perhaps 1900 clusters @xcite , it should have 40 to 50 clusters with @xmath11 .",
    "by contrast , all the local group galaxies combined contain perhaps @xmath12 globular clusters and thus have only a few with @xmath11 .",
    "ngc 5128 thus gives us the opportunity , in a single galaxy , to explore the empirical fp relations at extremely high cluster mass approaching @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "clusters in galaxies as distant as centaurus appear barely nonstellar under typical ground - based imaging resolutions of @xmath15 but can be much more well resolved with the cameras on hst .",
    "the first clear demonstration that accurate structural profiles and king - model parameters could be obtained for these objects was provided by @xcite , who studied a single outer - halo cluster in ngc 5128 .",
    "shortly afterward , @xcite obtained similar results for a selection of inner - halo clusters . in this paper , we present new imaging data for another sample of clusters in this important galaxy , more than doubling the total sample .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath16 mpc for ngc 5128 and a foreground ( milky way ) reddening of @xmath17 , for an apparent distance modulus @xmath18 @xcite . at this distance , 1 arcsecond is equivalent to a linear scale of 19.4 pc .",
    "our adopted distance is a mean of the results from three methods including the red - giant - branch tip luminosity @xcite , the planetary nebula luminosity function @xcite , and the @xmath19band surface brightness fluctuation technique @xcite .",
    "the mean distance is likely to be uncertain to @xmath20 mpc based on the close mutual agreement of these methods .",
    "during the course of an hst cycle 9 snapshot program ( go-8664 ) we obtained new images centered on 18 known globular clusters spread throughout the halo of ngc 5128 . these were all 400-second exposures with the stis camera in its unfiltered 50ccd / cl imaging mode and with gain=1 @xmath21 per du .",
    "in addition to the stis material , we also had in hand long - exposure wfpc2 @xmath22 images ( gain = 7 ) of four clusters from our previously published photometric studies of the halo red - giant stars in this galaxy @xcite .",
    "two objects , g302 and the newly discovered cluster c100 ( see below ) , were imaged with both stis and wfpc2 , providing a small but useful consistency test of our structural fitting routines .",
    "the candidate objects were all selected from the photometric list of known ngc 5128 clusters analyzed by @xcite ; our identification numbers ( c and g prefixes ) follow their list and are given in table [ coords ] .",
    "all but one of our clusters were imaged either at the stis scale of @xmath23/px or the pc1 scale of @xmath24/px ; the one remaining object ( g19 ) fell on the lower - resolution @xmath25/px scale of the wf3 camera .",
    "all of the individual stis and wfpc2 frames were inspected carefully to locate any clearly nonstellar objects in the field regardless of brightness , in addition to the previously known clusters .",
    "almost two dozen additional cluster candidates not in any previous lists were located this way . on closer inspection ,",
    "most of the `` extra '' candidates proved to be more likely to be faint background galaxies , with light profiles that were asymmetric , highly extended , or lumpy .",
    "however , seven were found to have characteristic sizes and symmetric king - type profiles like those of globular clusters and are thus kept in our sample .",
    "we believe these to be newly discovered clusters in ngc 5128 . our final list of 27 objects which we regard as definite or highly probable globular clusters in ngc 5128 is presented in table [ coords ] ; the seven new objects are assigned i d numbers c100 - c106 .    in figure [ samples ] , we show portions of the stis images to illustrate the appearances of three of our measured clusters having a range of luminosities and galactocentric distances . as will be shown more quantitatively below , the cluster images are well resolved compared with the profiles of stars ( psfs ) .",
    "the first step in our analysis was to take the preprocessed images supplied by the stsci archive and derive positions and total magnitudes for each object .",
    "the coordinates were obtained directly from the information in the image headers and the stsdas _",
    "xy2rd _ routine and are expected to be accurate to @xmath26 .",
    "these are listed in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of table [ coords ] , along with their projected galactocentric distance @xmath27 ( column 3 ) under the assumption @xmath28(ngc 5128 ) = 4 mpc . the final column of the table gives the particular detector ( stis , pc1 , or wf3 ) on which the cluster was imaged .    for measurement of total magnitudes , we constructed curves of growth ( integrated magnitude vs. aperture radius ) from concentric - aperture photometry to select an aperture radius large enough to enclose almost all the cluster light without being dominated by sky noise .",
    "we adopted @xmath29 px @xmath30 ( as will be seen below , at this radius we reach the outermost extreme at which we can trace the surface brightness profile for most of the clusters ) . for a few cases where the objects were crowded by neighboring stars , we used the largest feasible uncrowded aperture radius and then applied the fiducial curves of growth to make the ( small ) necessary extrapolations out to @xmath31 .    for the four clusters ( c44 , g19 , g302 , c100 ) on the wfpc2 frames , converting the integrated instrumental magnitudes into @xmath32 and @xmath33 was a straightforward matter of applying the usual calibration equations @xcite for the relevant filters ( f606w , f814w ) .",
    "their resulting @xmath34 magnitudes and colors are listed in columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of table [ coords ] .    for the much larger set of objects measured on stis ,",
    "the unfiltered ( `` clear '' or cl ) 50ccd configuration of the camera has a central wavelength near that of the standard @xmath32 magnitude and thus can be transformed moderately well into @xmath32 . here",
    "we label the 50ccd `` instrumental '' magnitude as @xmath35 log @xmath36 ( where @xmath36 in dn / sec is the measured flux from the object ) .",
    "however , the zeropoints @xmath37 quoted in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the synphot method using photflam from the image header , differ by 0.2 mag or more from one source to another . to set the stis photometric zeropoint for this particular study we rely instead on two _ local _ calibration methods which employ the clusters themselves .",
    "since these calibrating objects are exactly the same entities as our program objects , this approach also minimizes any systematic error due to nonzero color terms in the transformation .",
    "first , we used the small set of @xmath34 measurements for clusters obtained by @xcite ; comparing our list with theirs revealed 11 clusters in common .",
    "second , we used the washington photometry @xmath38 of the clusters published by @xcite along with the established conversion into @xmath32 ( see * ? ? ? * ) , @xmath39 this approach gave @xmath32 magnitudes for 16 clusters in our observed list .    in figure [ vcalib ]",
    "we plot the difference @xmath40 against @xmath32 .",
    "the tonry / schechter sample gives @xmath41 with an rms dispersion @xmath42 mag , while the transformed washington photometry gives @xmath43 with dispersion @xmath44 mag .",
    "though there is a noticeable difference between the two methods , we have no basis to prefer one strongly over the other .",
    "mag , very similar to our net difference of @xmath45 . ] averaging all the data together , we adopt @xmath46 . in the end",
    ", it should be recognized that the stis magnitudes can not be as accurately calibrated as normal ones that are filter - defined , but they are expected to be useful to approximately the accuracy quoted .",
    "it is encouraging that , for our only uncrowded object measured with both wfpc2 and stis ( cluster g302 ) , the calculated stis / cl magnitude agrees with the wfpc2 one to 0.05 mag .",
    "the agreement is not as close for cluster c100 , also measured with both stis and pc1 , but this object is severely crowded by a star of comparable brightness only @xmath15 away .",
    "the model fitting was carried out in two partially independent ways as follows :    \\(1 ) we performed `` two - dimensional '' fits whereby a @xcite model with a given set of parameters @xmath47 ( central potential @xmath48 , core radius @xmath49 , central concentration @xmath50 log@xmath5 , and ellipticity @xmath51 ) is calculated , and then convolved with the full two - dimensional psf shape for the given image .",
    "the psf profile was determined empirically from several bright uncrowded stars on the frames .",
    "the seeing - convolved model is then matched to the surface brightness of the raw cluster image after subtraction of the background light , and the king model parameters are varied to achieve the best match to the data .",
    "the procedure is described fully in @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) for comparison , we used the empirical ellipse - fitting code in _ stsdas _ ( _ analysis.isophote.ellipse _ ) to generate smoothed profiles for all the candidate objects along with estimates of the surrounding local background light intensity .",
    "the _ ellipse _",
    "code expects only that the light profile of the object is ellipsoidal and decreasing monotonically outward . in carrying out the fits we allowed",
    "the ellipticity and position angle of each annulus to vary but kept the ellipse center fixed . by subtracting the model from the original image and inspecting the residual light",
    ", we found that the background surface brightness @xmath52 could be determined ( on the stis images ) with a typical uncertainty of @xmath53 dn ( or @xmath54 for a gain of 1 @xmath21/dn ) ; changes in the background larger than that above or below the nominal @xmath52 level left clearly distinct outer `` edges '' once the profile was subtracted from the cluster . in this way",
    ", we found that we could trace the cluster light profiles down to a level within about 3% - 5% of the sky background .",
    "attempts to probe still fainter proved to push the measurements on these relatively short - exposure frames past their reliable limits .",
    "if higher s / n data are obtained in future , however , it should be possible to study the outermost envelopes of these clusters more thoroughly .    the _ ellipse _ code generated one - dimensional lists of surface brightness vs. semi - major axis .",
    "these were then matched to 1-d king model profiles convolved with the psf profile .",
    "sample profiles and best - fitting king models are shown in figure [ profiles ] for four clusters covering a wide range of brightness .",
    "the seeing - convolved model profiles match the clusters quite well particularly in the inner and middle radial range where the cluster light is much brighter than the background .",
    "the only exceptions were a few of the very faintest objects for which the signal - to - noise was lowest and the contrast over background the smallest . compared with the stellar psf , which has a fwhm of @xmath55 , the cluster profiles are typically about three times broader and thus very well resolved .",
    "sample illustrations of the quality of fit of the generic king models are given in figure [ resid ] , where ( for the same four clusters as in figure [ profiles ] ) we show the residuals after subtraction of the model profile from the _ ellipse _ code measurements . at an intensity level about one magnitude fainter than the background level , the internal uncertainties of the measured points become very large and do little to constrain the fit . at",
    "smaller radii , however , the model adheres closely to the data , with typical scatters of @xmath56 mag per data point . for comparison ( see below ) , on these graphs the core radii of the clusters would fall typically at log @xmath57 and the half - light radii at log @xmath58 , well within the higher - precision part of the fit .",
    "in general we found that the two methods outlined above agreed well , though the 1-d fits tended to be numerically more robust ( in several cases , particularly for faint objects , the 2-d fit did not converge satisfactorily ) .",
    "the adopted mean values of the structural parameters for all of our program objects , from the average of the two methods , are summarized in table [ parameters ] . in the table , we also include the half - light radius @xmath59 as calculated from the model fit , since it is of interest as a quantity which is relatively immune to dynamical evolution within the cluster . the _ projected _ half - light radius @xmath60 , a more conventionally used observational quantity , can be obtained from the ( three - dimensional ) quantity @xmath61 by the numerical approximation @xmath62 , which is accurate to a few percent over the range of @xmath63values that apply to normal clusters .",
    "the mean uncertainties in each measured quantity are listed at the bottom of the table .",
    "@xcite , through extensive numerical tests including simulated clusters , found that the expected measurement uncertainties for all quantities were 5% - 10% depending on brightness .",
    "for the two clusters g302 and c100 ( the latter object being crowded by a bright star , as noted above ) measured on both the stis and wfpc2 data , the independently determined model fits gave structural parameters in good mutual agreement ( see table [ parameters ] ) .",
    "for these two , we adopted the core radii and ellipticities from the wfpc2 images since they were much longer exposures and thus higher s / n .",
    "the central surface brightnesses @xmath64 ( @xmath32 mag per arcsec@xmath65 ) listed in table 2 are partially `` indirect '' measurements in the sense that they are the surface brightnesses of our best - fit king - model curves read off at zero radius .",
    "we stress that the innermost core structures at @xmath66 can not be truly resolved for any of our program objects .",
    "thus ( for example ) if any of them is in fact a core - collapsed object with a power - law profile for the inner core , we would significantly underestimate @xmath64 and overestimate @xmath49 .",
    "the last column of the table gives the position angle @xmath67 of the isophotal major axis , measured counterclockwise ( eastward ) from north .",
    "the best - fitting orientation angle often varied by @xmath68 or so from the inner parts of the cluster to the outskirts , but our quoted mean refers to the position angle near the half - light radius @xmath61 ( see below ) .",
    "these orientation angles are more uncertain for clusters of smaller ellipticity .",
    "we find no statistical preference for any particular cluster orientation .",
    "in the course of examining the profiles of all the individual clusters , we noted that for some of the brighter clusters in the sample , the fitted king models fell clearly below the measured cluster profile at the largest radii , even though the model fit was extremely accurate at smaller radii .",
    "in other words , within the context of the formal model fits ( which are based on the assumptions of isotropic velocity dispersion and a single - mass stellar population ) these clusters exhibit `` extratidal light '' ( xtl ) continuing outward past the nominal tidal radius @xmath69 .",
    "illustrations of this effect for four objects are shown in figure [ tidaltails ] .",
    "although any individual data point at large radius is quite uncertain ( see fig .",
    "[ resid ] ) , these half - dozen clusters are among the brightest and have the best - determined profiles of the entire sample .    to test the reality of this phenomenon , we went through the numerical exercise of arbitrarily adjusting the adopted background intensity level @xmath70 until the `` extra '' light at large radius essentially vanished and the residual outer profile approximately fit the king model at all radii .",
    "the size of this arbitrary shift @xmath71 was then compared with the true external uncertainty in the background ( typically @xmath72 dn , as noted above ) . for most clusters in the sample ,",
    "the necessary shift @xmath71 was @xmath73 and thus the significance of the effect was marginal at best ; that is , we found that _ small _ positive or negative deviations relative to the king models at large radii could be readily understood as slightly incorrect adopted backgrounds .",
    "however , for six clusters ( listed in table 3 ) , we found @xmath74 and for these we cautiously suggest the presence of a real xtl component .",
    "all six of these clusters are brighter than @xmath75 and thus are comparable with @xmath76 centauri and ngc 6715 , the two most luminous clusters in the milky way .",
    "for these six objects we subtracted the king model from the observed profile to derive the amount of residual light present in the xtl `` tail '' . in table",
    "[ xtl.tab ] , we list the projected galactocentric distance @xmath27 ; the cluster luminosity @xmath77 ( including the xtl ) ; the increase in background light @xmath71 necessary to artificially remove the anomaly ; and the fraction of the total cluster light which is in the extratidal component .",
    "although they are only marginally significant , these fractions range from 7% to 17% of the cluster luminosity and thus represent a significant part of their entire stellar population .",
    "the candidate xtl objects show no preference for any particular halo location , with galactocentric distances ranging from 6 to 22 kpc .",
    "the shapes of these extratidal profiles strongly resemble what has been found for a few clusters in both the milky way @xcite and m31 @xcite .",
    "if the xtl is real , it may then represent tidally stripped or evaporated stars now drifting away from the cluster . deeper imaging data than we have at present",
    "may be able to trace these faint components further outward along thin streamers which would mark out the clusters orbital paths .",
    "another interpretation discussed in the recent literature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that objects like these may be the luminous , compact nuclei of former dwarf satellite galaxies ( de , n systems ) that were accreted long ago . in this case",
    ", the xtl would be interpreted as the residual trace of the de field - star population .",
    "this idea has gained additional impetus from the observation that ngc 6715 ( the second most luminous cluster in the milky way halo ) is near the center of the disrupting sagittarius dwarf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also from a variety of recent observations of @xmath76 cen indicating multi - epoch star formation ( cf .",
    "the references cited above ) .",
    "it is probably not surprising that several clusters in our sample ( 6 clusters out of 27 observed ) show these extended envelopes , because our entire sample of clusters is biased in favor of such objects .",
    "as noted above , our candidates for stis imaging were drawn from a list of known clusters @xcite which were in turn identified from ground - based photographic plates on the basis of nonstellar appearance .",
    "thus the objects in our list should be expected to be biased towards _",
    "bright clusters with extended envelopes _ which were easiest to pick out as nonstellar under @xmath78 seeing .",
    "( one of the clusters we find to have an extended envelope , number c7 , is the first cluster identified in ngc 5128 by graham & phillips 1980 ) .",
    "an alternative and more conservative interpretation of these extended profiles is that the outer parts of these clusters actually do not consist of `` excess '' light , but might be fitted instead by models incorporating multi - mass stellar populations and/or an anisotropic velocity distribution .",
    "either or both of these steps would allow fitting of a greater range of projected density profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "higher - quality data than we have at present will be needed to discriminate more clearly among these alternatives .",
    "the globular clusters we have observed in this program are scattered throughout the ngc 5128 halo , with projected galactocentric distances ranging from @xmath79 to 25 kpc . @xcite",
    "have obtained structural parameters for 21 more objects projected on the _ inner _ halo of the galaxy ( @xmath80 kpc ) , so by combining their sample with ours we can trace out any trends in the structural parameters over a much wider @xmath27 range .    from the holland et al",
    ".  list , we more or less arbitrarily reject five objects with extreme colors ( 4 with @xmath81 which are likely to be either very heavily reddened globulars or background galaxies , and one very blue object with @xmath82 ) .",
    "all of these five have colors quite different from the @xmath83 level characterizing all known globular clusters .",
    "the remaining 16 , added to our 27 , give a total list of 43 definite or highly probable globular clusters with measured king parameters .",
    "the major noteworthy difference between the two sets of objects is that the 16 from @xcite were all measured with rather short wfpc2 exposures ( mostly 180 sec ) , with higher background light , and on the low - resolution wf2 , 3 or 4 detectors .",
    "thus they are taken from lower - s / n data and with poorer image sampling than were the majority of the objects in our new program .",
    "we first briefly compare our ngc 5128 clusters with those in the milky way , using data from the 1999 edition of the @xcite catalog . as did @xcite , we restrict the milky way sample to 78 clusters more luminous than @xmath84 , with reddenings lower than @xmath85 , and further from the galactic center than 1 kpc , to make it as similar as possible to our ngc 5128 sample .",
    "histogram comparisons of core radius and ellipticity are shown in figures [ rc_comp ] and [ e_comp ] .",
    "the core radii for clusters in both galaxies fall very much in the same global range ( @xmath86 pc for almost all objects ) , and the medians of the two distributions are also similar ( median @xmath87 pc for ngc 5128 , 1.16 pc for the milky way ) .",
    "however , the milky way sample has relatively more objects at very small @xmath49 .",
    "this difference is likely to be due to a combination of selection effects : as noted above , many of the ngc 5128 candidate clusters were pre - selected for their nonstellar appearance on ground - based images and thus the sample is already biased towards extended structure . in addition , it becomes increasingly difficult on numerical grounds to measure the true value of a core radius less than @xmath88 ( 0.5 pc ) given that it is convolved with a psf profile with hwhm @xmath89 .",
    "we suggest that there are likely to be many highly compact clusters with small core radii in ngc 5128 still waiting to be found .",
    "our ngc 5128 sample also lacks objects with _",
    "core radii @xmath90 pc , a few of which exist in the milky way comparison diagram .",
    "although the current statistical sample is small , we believe that this discrepancy might well be due to selection effects as well . most of these milky way objects are moderately faint , diffuse objects in the outer halo , and it is entirely likely that such objects would not have been noticed in the photographic image surveys from which our target list was selected ( see above ) .",
    "our cluster ellipticity measurements are shown in figure [ e_comp ] ( @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the minor - to - major axial ratio ) .",
    "these are weighted averages by annular luminosity over the measured radial range of the model fits and correspond roughly to the @xmath1values at the `` half - light '' radius @xmath61 commonly used in the literature .",
    "often the fitted ellipticity is found to be a weak function of radius , though none of the clusters exhibited dramatic ellipticity gradients . in the second - last column of table 2",
    ", we indicate whether the cluster showed a clear increase in @xmath93 with @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , a decrease ( @xmath96 ) , or no significant gradient ( blank column ) .",
    "returning to figure [ e_comp ] , we note that ngc 5128 has a rather flat , or modestly declining , @xmath1distribution over the range @xmath97",
    ". is likely to be an artifact of incomplete removal of the slightly elliptical psf , as also noted by @xcite . for larger @xmath93 ,",
    "it is less clear whether or not any particular subtle biasses or selection effects may exist in our sample .",
    "the clusters were identified as members of ngc 5128 either on the basis of radial velocity , or on the basis of their nonstellar appearance from lower - resolution ground - based images in which their slightly out - of - round shapes would have been at least partly washed out . however , a much more complete candidate list will be needed before these issues can be addressed more securely . ] from their small inner - halo sample of clusters , @xcite suggested that ngc 5128 had a much higher fraction of high - ellipticity clusters than did the milky way @xcite .",
    "we find that the medians for the two samples are at @xmath98 for ngc 5128 and 0.05 for the milky way , and a standard k - s test shows that the two distributions differ significantly at higher than 99% confidence level . in short ,",
    "we draw the same formal conclusion here as did holland et al .",
    "however , we do not place excessive weight on it at this stage because of lingering uncertainties about possible selection effects in our samples , which still represent a very small fraction of the entire ngc 5128 cluster population ( see the preceding footnote ) .",
    "in addition , the ellipticities for the milky way clusters follow from a somewhat different measurement process ( see * ? ? ? * ) and the possibility of small systematic differences remains a concern .",
    "the observed ellipticity must be a complex product of the initial structure of the cluster and its subsequent dynamical evolution but , as @xcite comment , `` our understanding of this problem is rather patchy '' .",
    "flattening is almost certainly caused primarily by global rotation of the cluster rather than internal properties such as velocity anisotropy or external ones such as tidal elongation @xcite .",
    "recent dynamical models indicate that internal relaxation coupled to the external tidal field will in most cases drive a cluster towards rounder shape over several relaxation times @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "evolution is generally faster at higher rotation , lower central potential @xmath48 , or smaller galactocentric distance @xmath27 .",
    "notable , but not overwhelming , evidence that this type of evolution actually occurs for real clusters may be seen in the lmc clusters , also shown in fig .",
    "[ e_comp ] .",
    "the shaded part of the lmc histogram shows the @xmath1distribution for 17 `` old '' clusters for which the evolutionary states should be more closely comparable with the milky way globulars ( specifically , these 17 are in swb age classes vi or vii ) . the unshaded part is for 48 younger clusters ( data from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the median ellipticities are @xmath100 for the older clusters and @xmath101 for the younger ones ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* who argue for a similar trend ) .",
    "the @xmath1distribution for the lmc clusters has long been realized to be different from the milky way ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "although an obvious problem with making such a comparison is that the great majority of the magellanic objects are `` young '' ( @xmath102 gyr ) relative to the globulars in m31 and the milky way and thus less dynamically evolved , it appears to be true that magellanic clusters of all ages have @xmath93 predominantly @xmath103 .",
    "interestingly , the old - lmc group statistically resembles our ngc 5128 sample ( they are different at less than 70% significance from a k - s test ) much more closely than does the _ younger _ lmc group ( which differs from ngc 5128 at more than 99% significance ) .",
    "lastly , in figure [ e_comp ] we also show comparisons with clusters in m31 , where the data are drawn from the high - resolution hst - based imaging study of @xcite . for the m31 sample ,",
    "we exclude four very faint objects with @xmath104 to keep the same luminosity range @xmath105 that we use for the milky way and ngc 5128 . even without these few high - ellipticity clusters , however , the ngc 5128 and m31 samples are also remarkably similar ( the difference has less than 50% significance from a k - s test ) .",
    "the m31/lmc / n5128 comparison casts some doubt on the hypotheses that either age or the strength of the external tidal field are the only , or major , factors determining the @xmath1distributions : instead , the data in these three quite different galaxies show that it is not unusual for very old clusters to have preserved clearly elliptical shapes ( @xmath106 ) over a hubble time and regardless of their present environment .",
    "yet another recently found example of a luminous globular cluster with high ellipticity is object 13 in the lenticular galaxy ngc 1023 , with @xmath107 @xcite . of the four galaxies shown here , the milky way is the one which stands out as `` different '' from the other three .",
    "more comprehensive datasets ( more galaxies , and more clusters per galaxy ) will be needed to gain a better idea of the significance of this preliminary result .    in a previous paper @xcite , we have noted that the metallicity distributions for the halo stars in ngc 5128 , m31 , and the lmc are also remarkably similar .",
    "the @xmath1distributions may constitute additional evidence for our speculation that much of the stellar content of ngc 5128 , and m31 , formed within magellanic - sized pregalactic units before assembling into the giant galaxies we see today .      in figure",
    "[ mu_v0 ] , we show the central surface brightness of our clusters from table 2 , plotted against core radius @xmath49 and central concentration @xmath8 . here , the @xmath64 values have been corrected for foreground absorption , which we adopt as @xmath108 . since",
    "our ngc 5128 sample is restricted mostly to the brighter ones in the galaxy , we are probing only a small part of the whole range of this correlation . nevertheless , just as for the other cluster properties _ except _ possibly for the ellipticities ( see above ) , the central surface brightnesses fall in the same broad regions of these scatter plots classically defined by the more well studied globular clusters in m31 and the milky way ( shown in figure [ mu_v0 ] by the dashed lines , adapted from figure 6 of barmby et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the scatter in the observed distribution arises from the spread in cluster luminosity @xmath3 at a given @xmath49 or @xmath109 ( see figure 19 of mclaughlin 2000a and his accompanying discussion ) .",
    "the only notable exceptions are the two faintest objects in our set , c102 and c105 , which have anomalously high central concentrations .",
    "however , the @xmath63values for these faint objects are very uncertain , and the possibility remains that these two may be background galaxies which crept through our selection criteria .",
    "higher - s / n images and multicolor measurements will be needed to confirm their identities .    in figure [ mv_corr ]",
    "we show the scatter plots of core radius @xmath49 , half - light radius @xmath59 , central concentration index @xmath8 , and ellipticity @xmath93 with cluster luminosity .",
    "the solid lines in each panel show the least - squares fits , which have the following slopes : @xmath110log @xmath111 , @xmath110log @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "the scale radii @xmath115 and ellipticity display considerable scatter and no significant trends with cluster luminosity , while the central concentration increases weakly with luminosity ; weak correlations of @xmath49 and @xmath8 vs. luminosity were derived by @xcite for the milky way clusters ( shown in figure [ mv_corr ] by the dashed lines ) . the lack of correlation of the characteristic radii @xmath116 with luminosity is closely connected to the narrow distribution of clusters in the fundamental plane , which we discuss in the next section",
    ". some of the @xmath49-distribution differences between the two galaxies are likely to be due simply to the sample bias we noted above . for the @xmath117 graph ( lower left panel )",
    "we note that the higher - resolution , higher - s / n data ( solid dots ) follow the milky way relation much more closely than do the lower - resolution data ( and would do so even more closely if the one `` high '' point at upper left were ignored , due to the very faint c102 ) , suggesting perhaps that the @xmath63values for the inner - halo data are systematically underestimated .",
    "the higher half - light radii from the lower - resolution data ( upper right panel ) may also be an artifact of the same effect .",
    "higher - resolution data for more clusters will be needed before these concerns can be cleared up definitively .    in figure [ rgc_corr ] the same four quantities are plotted against projected galactocentric distance @xmath27 .",
    "the two subgroups of measured clusters ( wfpc2 vs.  stis ) are more clearly separated in figure [ rgc_corr ] , because almost all of the lower - resolution wf data come from the inner - halo clusters .",
    "the same net offset towards lower @xmath8 at smaller @xmath27 which we noted above is clearly visible in the lower left panel .",
    "physically , we would have expected a higher mean @xmath8 closer to the center of the galaxy because of the stronger effects of dynamical evolution , as well as a smaller mean @xmath61 ( see below ) , again indicating that the low wf resolution may have compromised the model fits for the inner clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "any subtle real trends with @xmath27 may be washed out by the fact that we are observing only the projected distance rather than the true three - dimensional galactocentric distance .    as a further test of the effects of image resolution on the deduced structural parameters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more extensive discussion including simulations ) , we carried out some brief numerical trials with the stis data . for four clusters ( c22 , c23 , c102 , c103 ) , we rebinned the original images down to @xmath118 lower resolution ( @xmath119 per binned pixel ) to roughly simulate the resolution of the wf camera .",
    "we then remeasured the cluster profiles and fit the 1-d king profiles as before .",
    "the results for the key structural parameters @xmath120 were then compared with the original profiles .",
    "c23 is among the brightest in our sample , while c22 and c103 are of intermediate brightness and c102 is among the faintest .",
    "for the three brightest , the fitted @xmath48 values agreed with their higher - resolution counterparts to within 5% .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath8 values tended to be overestimated on the low - resolution images by about 5%-10% , while @xmath61 was overestimated by about 20% . for the very faint c102 ,",
    "the agreement with the high - resolution parameters was no better than @xmath12150% .",
    "these trials suggest to us that the @xmath118 lower resolution by itself does not seriously damage the ability to measure the structural parameters ( which at best are internally uncertain at the 10% level ; see above ) .",
    "instead , the signal - to - noise level of the data ( exposure time , cluster luminosity , background light ) seems to be a more important factor at the levels we are dealing with , and as noted above , the @xcite wfpc2 data were taken with shorter exposure times and higher background light from the inner halo .",
    "finally , in figure [ feh_rh ] we show the scatter plot of cluster half - light radius versus measured metallicity .",
    "since @xmath61 is closely related to the half - mass radius @xmath122 , which remains relatively constant over long timescales of dynamical evolution , @xmath61 represents a useful characteristic scale size for the cluster .",
    "a formal least - squares solution gives @xmath61(arcsec ) @xmath123 [ fe / h ] , confirming the immediate visual impression that no significant correlation exists .",
    "dividing the sample more or less arbitrarily into metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath124 ) and metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath125 ) groups , we find that the mean characteristic radii @xmath126 are @xmath127 pc and @xmath128 pc , indistinguishably different .",
    "this result is formally at odds with what has been found for the m31 clusters @xcite and for the clusters in certain giant e galaxies @xcite and in the giant sa galaxy m104 @xcite , where mild systematic _ decreases _ in cluster size with increasing metallicity have been claimed to exist .",
    "our result , however , may be a simple consequence of working with a small sample which is selection - biased towards large clusters",
    ". a much more comprehensive imaging set will be needed to explore this potentially important correlation adequately .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that in the trivariate space of central surface brightness , velocity dispersion , and core radius , the milky way globular clusters occupy only a relatively narrow region now called the `` fundamental plane '' , similar to that expected if the cores were virialized structures . @xcite",
    "have shown definitively with a comparably large sample of m31 clusters that they too fall in very much the same restricted region of parameter space .",
    "lacking any extensive direct measures of the internal velocity dispersions for the ngc 5128 clusters , we can not define the same graphs as for the milky way and m31 .",
    "we have , however , carried out a series of consistency tests which strongly suggest to us that the clusters in this giant e galaxy define a closely similar fp .",
    "here we cast the discussion in the way laid out by @xcite , in terms of the cluster _ binding energies _ @xmath2 . the binding energy is fundamentally related to the cluster _ mass _ @xmath129 , and on basic virial - theorem grounds , we expect a dependence of the form @xmath130 . combining mclaughlin s equations ( a6 ) and ( a7 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath2 in terms of the cluster core radius , luminosity , central concentration , and mass - to - light ratio : @xmath131 where @xmath132 are dimensionless functions of @xmath8 , and @xmath133 is the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "independent calibrations of @xmath133 require direct spectroscopic measurements of their internal velocity dispersions @xmath134 .",
    "as yet , little such material is available for ngc 5128 by comparison with the milky way and m31 .",
    "velocity dispersion measurements for 10 of the brightest ngc 5128 clusters are described by @xcite and stated to be in the range",
    "@xmath135 km s@xmath136 .",
    "a subsequent discussion by @xcite uses these to show that the ngc 5128 clusters fall , within the measurement uncertainties , on the top end of the same fp as in the milky way and m31 .",
    "the list of measured velocities from dubath ( private communication , and in preparation ) shows that there are four clusters in common between his sample and ours , and for these we can carry out complete calculations of @xmath137 .",
    "these four objects are listed in table 4 .",
    "we combine mclaughlin s ( 2000a ) expression ( a1 ) defining @xmath133 with his equation ( a6 ) to eliminate the central luminosity density @xmath138 , giving the mass - to - light ratio in terms of our measured parameters , @xmath139 where the scale velocity @xmath140 is given as a ratio of the measured dispersion @xmath134 by mclaughlin s relation ( b1 ) ; for any @xmath63values in our range of interest , we have @xmath141 to within a few percent .",
    "the structure of the cluster ( particularly , its central concentration @xmath8 ) enters through the dimensionless function @xmath142 .",
    "since @xmath142 varies by more than a factor of 20 over the @xmath63range occupied by typical globular clusters , @xmath133 is quite sensitive to both the velocity dispersion and the cluster structure ; we need to know both to estimate the cluster masses correctly .",
    "table 4 lists the measured velocity dispersions from dubath ; the structural luminosity parameter @xmath142 ; and the calculated mass - to - light ratio @xmath137 .",
    "taking into account the measurement uncertainties in @xmath134 , @xmath8 , @xmath49 , the integrated @xmath32 magnitudes , and the galaxy distance itself , we find that @xmath133 is uncertain to @xmath143% for a given object .",
    "the weighted average over the four clusters is @xmath144 . by comparison ,",
    "mclaughlin s mean value @xmath145 ( a mean over 39 milky way clusters ) is not significantly different , and provides an encouraging consistency test that the two groups of clusters are similar .",

    "( 2 ) becomes @xmath147 given @xmath148 for each cluster we can then estimate its binding energy _",
    "modulo _ our uncertainty in the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the results for our combined sample of 43 clusters are displayed graphically in figure [ ebplane ] as @xmath2 versus @xmath3 .",
    "a straightforward linear least - squares correlation , unweighted , gives @xmath149 with a residual scatter in log @xmath2 of @xmath150 dex .",
    "the measurement uncertainties in the quantities used to calculate @xmath2 generate expected scatters of @xmath151 in log @xmath49 , @xmath152 in log @xmath153 , and @xmath154 in log @xmath142 . adding these in quadrature",
    ", we obtain a net expected dispersion of @xmath155 in log @xmath2 , sufficient to explain almost all of the observed spread in figure [ ebplane ] .    for comparison , from a sample of 109 non - core - collapsed milky way clusters",
    "@xcite obtained the correlation ( see his figure 6 and accompanying text ) @xmath156 the dispersion about this latter relation is @xmath157 dex , though it should be noted that the scatter is @xmath15830% smaller if @xmath2 is normalized to a constant galactocentric distance ; see the discussion of mclaughlin and his figure 12 .",
    "a basic @xmath159 proportionality of @xmath2 is of course built directly into eq .",
    "what is more interesting is that the observed slope of the actual sequence is so close to 2.00 , and the scatter around the relation is so small , that the other factors ( @xmath160 ) _ in combination _ must not vary importantly with cluster mass @xmath129 itself ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more extensive discussion ) .",
    "secondly , the ngc 5128 sequence falls along a locus which , within its own uncertainties , is indistinguishable from the milky way sequence , consistent with the claim that we are looking at very much the same type of object with the same mean mass - to - light ratio ( see below ) .",
    "the ngc 5128 results also demonstrate clearly that the @xmath161 relation continues upward along the same slope to significantly higher cluster luminosities ( masses ) than were previously observed . whereas the milky way has only two clusters more luminous than @xmath75 , our ngc 5128 sample has 14 , and the relation now extends to almost a factor of three higher , reaching an equivalent mass of @xmath162 for @xmath163 .",
    "small though it is , some of the residual scatter in figure [ ebplane ] may correlate with other external factors such as age , metallicity , or galactocentric distance .",
    "although we can not evaluate age directly at present , the residual correlations against distance and metallicity are shown in figure [ eb_resid ] . to check for metallicity effects , we use 16 clusters in our list",
    "for which [ fe / h ] values are known from the washington photometry by @xcite .",
    "although @xmath164 colors are available for the other clusters in the list , most of these are inner - halo objects where some of the @xmath164 values are confused with possible internal reddening differences and are , in any event , not very sensitive to metallicity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting correlation ( lower panel of figure [ eb_resid ] ) is @xmath110 log @xmath165 [ fe / h ] @xmath166 .",
    "just as for the milky way , we find no trace of any dependence of binding energy on metallicity .    on the other hand , a change in mean @xmath2 with galactocentric distance is expected .",
    "we have @xmath167 by definition , and at least for the milky way , the characteristic cluster size @xmath122 is known to vary with @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite finds empirically that @xmath168 for the milky way system , consistent with rough theoretical arguments that predict @xmath169 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for an isothermal halo potential well .",
    "that is , the linear scale sizes of the clusters should reflect the sizes of their initial protocluster gas clouds , and the clouds will have larger scale sizes in the outer regions of the halo where they are under lower ambient pressures . in the ngc",
    "5128 data sample we can look for the same effect , although ( unlike the milky way ) we can work only with the _ projected _ galactocentric distances rather than the full three - dimensional @xmath27 . in the upper panel of figure [ eb_resid ]",
    "we show @xmath170 versus @xmath27 , where the latter now denotes the projected distance .",
    "the resulting correlation is @xmath110 log @xmath165 log @xmath171 .",
    "this is a significant trend in the same sense as was found for the milky way , though projection into two dimensions has , as expected , left a shallower slope .",
    ", when it is extended to a larger and more well determined statistical sample , may eventually place some interesting new constraints on the formation history of ngc 5128 .",
    "the reason is that the clusters which are _ now _ in the halo have characteristic radii @xmath122 that still reflect their place of formation .",
    "for example , if they formed within disks of large progenitor galaxies under conditions of high ambient pressure , they would maintain their original small characteristic sizes even after the disks merged to produce ngc 5128 and projected much of their material well out into the halo . on the other hand , if the clusters formed within lower - mass dwarfs which later merged , they would have larger effective radii consistent with the weak potential wells in which they formed .",
    "detailed simulations will be needed to test whether the slope of a relation such as in figure [ eb_resid ] can be maintained after a long series of mergers of many types of progenitor galaxies . ]",
    "too much reliance can not be placed on this latter result , since the datapoints at small @xmath27 may have measurement biasses as discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , if we now rather boldly accept the main trend of the effect and normalize all the @xmath2 values to a fiducial distance ( 10 kpc ) by defining @xmath172 the net result is to yield a corrected binding - energy relation as shown in figure [ ebstar ] with the equation @xmath173 and with a dispersion of only @xmath174 dex over its entire run .",
    "the analysis so far has assumed a uniform age for all clusters in the sample .",
    "age differences would be expected to enter mainly through the mass - to - light ratio , which decreases with increasing age . since @xmath175 , any mean age difference between the milky way and ngc 5128",
    "would then show up in figure [ ebplane ] as a net offset of the data points away from the milky way line .",
    "if , for example , the ngc 5128 clusters were actually much younger , the points in figure [ ebstar ] would then have fallen above the milky way line : that is , by adopting the mean @xmath163 valid for old clusters , we would have overestimated their masses ( and thus their binding energies ) for a given luminosity .",
    "approximate predictions for the amount of the effect are shown in figure [ ebstar ] by the two dotted lines parallel to the main relation , the upper one for a cluster age of 2 gy and the lower one for 5 gy .",
    "we have used bruzual / charlot relations ( quoted by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the change in cluster luminosity @xmath176 with age to estimate these offsets .",
    "thus for _ individual _ clusters , age differences of factors of two are discernible on this diagnostic graph . in practice ,",
    "no offset from the milky way cluster line is detectable to well within the observational scatter , so our data are strongly consistent with the claim that we are looking at basically the same type of object in both galaxies : old , luminous star clusters with similar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "@xcite has suggested that the three quantities @xmath177 provide a physically transparent way to describe the fundamental plane or `` @xmath1space '' for globular cluster structures . in figure [ ebstar ]",
    "we are essentially looking at the fp edge - on , but tilted .",
    "a rectified form of the fp can be generated from a suitable rotation of the @xmath178 plane , given by @xmath179 log @xmath180 log @xmath3 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 .",
    "the edge - on view ( figure [ ebstar ] ) is essentially a rotated version of ( @xmath183 . a fully `` face - on '' view of the fp can then be constructed from a plot of @xmath184 against @xmath185 .",
    "this plot is shown in figure [ fp ] .",
    "there is little left in this plane but pure scatter , but this may simply be reflecting the limitations of our small sample .",
    "a larger sample extending downward to much lower luminosities might reveal the same overall trend with @xmath8 ( lower central concentration at lower luminosity ) that is clearly found in the milky way ( compare figure 13 of * ? ? ? * shown here as the dashed line ) .",
    "the remarkably tight @xmath161 relation , for clusters at all galactocentric distances , hints that it was set largely by the cluster formation process @xcite . for protocluster gas clouds @xmath2 should behave in proportion to @xmath186 , if they are constrained at the time of star formation by an external pressure @xmath187 which itself varies as @xmath188 in the isothermal potential well of the protogalaxy ( see * ? ?",

    "the fully formed clusters we observe today obey a distinctly different and steeper relation ( @xmath195 rather than @xmath196 ) , indicating perhaps that the lower - mass clusters lost relatively more of their binding energy through early gas loss .    under the assumptions of this doubtless - oversimplified model",
    ", the protocluster @xmath2 line should represent an upper boundary which could only be reached by the actual star clusters if their star formation efficiency approached 100% .",
    "however , we see that at the upper end the most massive known clusters lie _ above _ the gas - cloud relation by as much as a factor of two . at this point",
    "we can only speculate on possible interpretations : our schematic model for the gas clouds may be too rough , or the clusters may have evolved dynamically away from their initial conditions to a state of higher binding energy .",
    "the dynamics of cloud collapse and star formation during a cluster s earliest stages are poorly understood , and there may be various mass - dependent phenomena at work whose results we see in the present - day @xmath161 correlation .",

    "the ngc 5128 clusters occupy very much the same regions of parameter space as those in the milky way , with the exception that they have a higher range of ellipticities : they occupy the range @xmath97 more or less uniformly , and among various comparison galaxies within the local group , we find that they most nearly resemble the old clusters in the lmc and m31 in this respect .",
    "we also find half a dozen luminous clusters which may have `` extratidal light '' which is possibly due to active tidal stripping or residual field - star populations from disrupted dwarf satellite galaxies , but may also be the signature of anisotropic velocity distributions .",
    "lastly , we find that the ngc 5128 clusters delineate a relation between binding energy @xmath2 and luminosity @xmath3 which is even tighter than in the milky way and in exactly the same region of the `` fundamental plane '' .",

    "<S> we present new imaging measurements of 27 individual globular clusters in the halo of the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 , obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ stis and wfpc2 cameras . </S>",
    "<S> we use the cluster light profiles to determine their structural parameters ( core and half - light radii , central concentration , and ellipticity ) . combining these with similar data for selected inner - halo clusters from holland et al .  </S>",
    "<S> 1999 ( aap , 348 , 418 ) , we now have a total sample of 43 ngc 5128 globular clusters with measured structural properties . </S>",
    "<S> we find that classic king - model profiles match the clusters extremely well , and that their various structural parameters ( core- and half - light radius , central surface brightness , central concentration ) fall in very much the same range as do the clusters in the milky way and m31 . </S>",
    "<S> we find half a dozen bright clusters which show tentative evidence for `` extra - tidal light '' that extends beyond the nominal tidal radius , similar in nature to several such objects previously found in the milky way and m31 ; these may represent clusters being tidally stripped , or possibly ones in which anisotropic velocity distributions are important . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm previous indications that ngc 5128 contains relatively more clusters with large ( @xmath0 ) ellipticity than does the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the @xmath1distribution of the ngc 5128 clusters strongly resembles that of the old clusters in the lmc and also in m31 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , calculations of the cluster binding energies @xmath2 as defined by mclaughlin 2000 ( apj , 539,618 ) show that the ngc 5128 clusters occupy the same extremely narrow region of the parametric `` fundamental plane '' as do their milky way counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> our data are thus strongly consistent with the claim that the globular clusters in both ngc 5128 and the milky way are fundamentally the same type of object : old star clusters with similar mass - to - light ratios and king - model structures . </S>"
