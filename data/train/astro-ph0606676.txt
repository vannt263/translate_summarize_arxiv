    "observations at longer wavelengths , such as 70@xmath0 m which is closer to the far - infrared peak of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and is away from the strong mid - ir features , are crucial for constraining the infrared luminosities and star - formation rates .",
    "the previous deep guaranteed time observer ( gto ) surveys did not achieve sufficient sensitivity at 70@xmath0 m to detect distant luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath5 ) , without stacking 70@xmath0 m data for a large number of 24@xmath0m - selected sources ( dole et al .",
    "much deeper observations are needed at 70@xmath0 m to individually detect the @xmath6 lirgs that account for the majority of the extragalactic background light ( elbaz et al .",

    "the ultra - deep 70@xmath0 m observations of the northern field of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods - n ) were carried out in cycle-1 of the general observer ( go ) program ( _ spitzer _ program 3325 ) .",
    "the survey covers the central @xmath7 of goods - n to a depth of 10.6ks .",
    "the data were taken using small - field photometry mode with 10mips - second data collection events ( dces ) .",
    "the field was observed with an 8 position cluster map for each astronomical observational request ( aor ) .",
    "the observations were repeated with 12 aors taking 34.5 hours of observatory time in total .",
    "the mapping order and dither positions of the cluster positions within the aors were varied to provide uniform coverage and data quality across the field .",
    "the data were embargoed until after the gto proprietary period and were released to our team in 2005 august .",
    "in addition to the go data , we used the mips gto data of goods - n ( _ spitzer _ program 81 , dole et al .",
    "the gto data were taken in slow scan mode with one degree scan legs and have an integration time of 600s at 70@xmath0 m , covering an area of 0.6deg@xmath8 .",
    "the raw data were downloaded from the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) archive and were processed from scratch using the offline germanium reprocessing tools ( gert , s13 version 1.0 ) .",
    "the instrumental artifacts in the basic calibration data ( bcds ) were removed adopting the filtering techniques used for the reduction of the extragalactic first look survey ( xfls , frayer et al .",
    "the bcd pipeline processing and filtering procedures were optimized for these deep photometry data .",
    "we adopted the updated s13 calibration , which assumes an absolute flux calibration factor based on stellar seds of 702mjysr@xmath9 per mips-70 data unit .",
    "we then multiplied the data by the color correction factor of 1.09 to place the data on a constant @xmath10 scale , which is also the appropriate color correction ( within 2% ) for a wide range of possible galaxy seds ( see ssc web pages for calibration and color - correction details ) . in comparison ,",
    "the calibration correction adopted here is 3.4% larger than the calibration adopted for the xfls analysis ( frayer et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the filtering of the data is a crucial aspect in the processing . for the 70@xmath0 m photometry mode ,",
    "calibration stimulator ( stim ) flashes are used every 6 dces , and latents due to these stim flashes accumulate over time . to remove stim flash latents and additional artifacts",
    ", we used a median column filter followed by a median high - pass time filter per pixel ( with a filter width of 16 dces ) .",
    "the positions of bright sources in the bcds were flagged so that the filtering corrections were not biased by the presence of sources .",
    "the median filtering techniques yield small offsets from zero in the average level of the filtered - bcds ( fbcds ) .",
    "these offsets correlate with the dce position within the stim cycle and were removed by subtracting the median level from each fbcd .",
    "the data were coadded onto a sky grid with @xmath11 pixels using the ssc mosaicing and source extraction software ( mopex , version 112505 ) .",
    "sources were extracted using mopex point source response function ( prf ) fitting . in crowded regions , the 24@xmath0 m positions ( r. chary et al .",
    ", in preparation ) were used for deblending . for optimal source extraction ,",
    "an accurate uncertainty image is needed .",
    "the uncertainty image was constructed by combining the noise per pixel based on repeated observations with the local spatial pixel - to - pixel dispersion after the extraction of bright sources .",
    "the average level of the uncertainty image was then scaled to match the average empirical point - source noise derived by making multiple aperture measurements at random locations throughout the residual mosaic after source extraction .",
    "the scale factor between the aperture derived point source noise ( including the aperture correction ) and the pixel surface brightness noise is @xmath12(point source)/@xmath13 pixels ) @xmath14 [ mjy/(mjysr@xmath9 ) ] .",
    "the average point source noise for the ultra - deep area ( after the extraction of sources ) is 0.53mjy ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the applicability of the uncertainty image for point source extraction was verified by obtaining prf fits with @xmath16 for sources throughout the image .",
    "previous surveys with _ spitzer _ are not deep enough to measure the photometric confusion noise at 70@xmath0 m , and the estimated confusion level is based on the observed bright source counts and models of galaxy evolution ( dole et al .",
    "2004b ) . with the ultra - deep data of goods - n",
    ", we can directly measure the confusion level at 70@xmath0 m .",
    "we define the instrument noise ( including photon noise , detector noise , and noise associated with the data processing ) as @xmath17 .",
    "the total noise ( @xmath18 ) represents the noise after the extraction of sources above a limiting flux density ( @xmath19 ) , and the confusion noise ( @xmath20 ) represents fluctuations due to sources with flux densities below @xmath19 . as defined here",
    ", @xmath21 is the `` photometric '' confusion noise , following the terminology of dole , lagache , & puget ( 2003 ) . in the direction of goods - n , the contribution of galactic cirrus to the confusion noise is negligible ( @xmath220.02mjy ) , based on the relationship given by dole et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and the calculations of jeong et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the instrument noise was estimated empirically by subtracting pairs of data with the same integration time and covering the exact same region on the sky to remove sources and any remaining residuals from the sky after filtering .",
    "the measured instrument noise integrates down nearly with @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for these data , we find @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for integration time @xmath26 in units of ks",
    ". the functional form of this relationship is based on empirical results from several different data sets , and the @xmath27 parameter depends on the background level and the quality of the data reduction .",
    "we use the above function to extrapolate the instrument noise from half the data to the full data set and derive @xmath28mjysr@xmath9 .",
    "since the total noise image ( after source extraction ) and instrumental noise image have nearly gaussian distributions , the confusion noise can also be approximated by a gaussian and is given by @xmath29 .",
    "we iterate between source extraction at different limiting flux densities and confusion noise measurements until we converge to a solution with @xmath30 . for the @xmath4 solution ,",
    "we derive @xmath31mjysr@xmath9 and @xmath32mjysr@xmath9 , for a limiting source flux density of s70@xmath33mjy.s@xmath34(71.4@xmath0 m ) and s24@xmath35s@xmath34(23.7@xmath0 m ) throughout this paper . ] including the additional systematic uncertainties of the absolute calibration scale ( 10% ) and the conversion between point source noise and surface brightness noise ( 10% , ",
    "3 ) , we derive a point source confusion noise of @xmath36mjy ( @xmath4 ) .    in comparison ,",
    "the predictions of dole et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004b ) suggest a @xmath4 photometric confusion level of @xmath37mjy , depending on the exact shape of the differential source counts .",
    "the measured confusion level of 0.3mjy agrees well with the predicted photometric confusion level .",
    "however , the source density criterion ( sdc ) confusion limit of 3.2mjy adopted by dole et al . is more than a factor of two higher than the limiting flux density derived here . the dole et al .",
    "sdc limit corresponds to @xmath38 and a high completeness level of @xmath39% .",
    "sources can be extracted at lower completeness levels , and counts can be derived reliably well below this sdc limit by making use of the 24@xmath0 m data to help extract the faintest sources .",
    "the source counts were derived separately for the central @xmath40 ultra - deep field , for the wide 0.614deg@xmath41 gto deep field , and for the @xmath42 intermediate field which includes the ultra - deep field and the surrounding regions of intermediate depth between the gto and ultra - deep surveys ( table  1 ) .",
    "analysis was done on the `` intermediate '' field for better statistics at s70@xmath43mjy .",
    "the central ultra - deep area has a deficiency ( @xmath4450% ) in number of sources with flux densities between 510mjy in comparison to typical areas surrounding goods - n , presumably due to cosmic variance .",
    "the intermediate and gto fields allow the measurement of source counts for flux densities ( 412mjy ) not well sampled by the ultra - deep goods - n and the shallow xfls surveys . the combination of the goods - n and the xfls data sets yields source counts over the flux density range from 1.2mjy to 455mjy ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the counts presented here are 12.5 times deeper than the counts previously published by the mips team ( dole et al .",
    "2004a ) and about 7 times deeper than the counts based on the xfls verification field ( frayer et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "sources were extracted for signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios of s / n@xmath452.5 for the ultra - deep field and s / n@xmath43 for the intermediate and gto - deep fields .",
    "the uncertainty image (  3 ) was used to represent the point - source noise as a function of position .",
    "the number of spurious sources for each flux bin was estimated by performing source extraction on the negative image .",
    "reliability degrades significantly below s / n@xmath46 . to compensate for spurious sources at low s /",
    "n , we required the presence of 24@xmath0 m counterparts in the ultra - deep field . since the goods 24@xmath0 m data ( m. dickinson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) are about 100 times more sensitive in flux density , very few , if any , 70@xmath0m - only detections are expected . within the ultra - deep field ,",
    "the chance coincidence within 8@xmath47 ( @xmath48 times the positional rms uncertainty of the faintest 70@xmath0 m sources ) of a 24@xmath0 m counterpart with s24@xmath49jy is 20% . by requiring 24@xmath0 m counterparts , we removed 80% of the spurious sources , and the observed counts",
    "were then corrected assuming a 20% chance match for the remaining spurious sources .    after correcting for reliability ,",
    "the observed source counts are corrected for completeness and flux biasing ( i.e. , the scattering of faint sources into brighter flux density bins ) using the monte carlo approach described by chary et al .",
    "simulated point sources spanning the full range of flux densities were injected at random positions into each image ( one at a time with 3@xmath50 repetitions per field ) . by using the simulations and the same source extraction methods , we populate a @xmath51 matrix representing the probability that a galaxy with input flux density @xmath52 is detected and measured with output flux density @xmath53 . by summing over the elements of the @xmath51 matrix ,",
    "the true counts are derived from the observed counts .",
    "this monte carlo approach allows the derivation of the counts at low completeness levels ; the completeness level for the faintest flux bin ( 1.21.6mjy ) is only 30% ( table 1 ) . the uncertainties on the counts include the uncertainties of the reliability corrections , the poissonian errors propagated through the @xmath51 matrix , and the 10% absolute flux calibration uncertainty combined in quadrature .",
    "the euclidean - normalized differential source counts turn over around 810mjy ( fig .",
    "the observed counts are consistent within 30% of the lagache et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model for bright flux densities .",
    "we find a slightly larger number of faint galaxies ( s70@xmath543mjy ) than predicted by lagache et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which may be due to cosmic variance in the direction of goods - n .",
    "ultra - deep 70@xmath0 m observations over larger areas and along different lines of sight are needed to constrain the models more accurately at faint flux densities .",
    "at low flux densities , a weighted least - squares fit to the differential source counts yields @xmath55 with @xmath56 . this is consistent with the power law of @xmath57 derived for the faint 24@xmath0 m sources ( chary et al .",
    "the observed fluctuations also constrain the faint source counts .",
    "we estimate the extrapolated source counts down to the confusion limit via simulations .",
    "different populations of sources covering a wide range of @xmath58 values and normalizations at 2mjy were randomly injected into the instrumental noise image and then extracted using the same techniques carried out for the confusion measurement .",

    "the expected extragalactic background light ( ebl ) due to infrared galaxies at 70@xmath0 m is fairly uncertain due to the difficulty of deriving accurate zodiacal light corrections for the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) measurements ( e.g. , wright 2004 ) . by interpolating between the 24@xmath0 m ebl value ( papovich et al .",
    "2004 ) , the 60@xmath0 m value ( miville - dechnes , lagache , & puget 2002 ) , and the dirbe 100@xmath0 m and 140@xmath0 m measurements ( wright 2004 ) , we estimate a predicted ebl level of @xmath62 at 71.4@xmath0 m . in comparison , dole et al .",

    "based on ultra - deep 70@xmath0 m observations , we derive source counts down to a flux density of 1.2mjy , directly resolving about 60% of the ebl .",
    "the total fraction of the ebl estimated for sources down to the confusion level ( @xmath69mjy , @xmath4 ) is about 75% .",
