    "the issues of opinion formation , population dynamics , ideology struggle , language competition and the dynamics of language death have attracted the interest of many physicists , particularly those applying the tools of statistical mechanics and complex systems . despite the existence of a connection between those issues , studies dealing with their combined effects on society are still relatively rare . in this paper ,",
    "i investigate the interplay between language competition and ideology struggle by formulating a lotka - volterra - type model in order to study the evolution of language and ideology in a country where there is a native high status language and a low status language spoken by immigrants coming from the same origin country .",
    "both languages compete against each other for speakers as in @xcite and i introduce the novelty that , among natives , there is an ideological struggle between two groups of individuals , a group of nationalists and a group whose members welcome immigrants and might have an interest in their culture and language .",
    "such kind of ideology struggle was studied in @xcite in a different framework using evolutionary game theory .",
    "the relevance and motivation to integrate the evolution of ideology and language into the same model can be seen in @xcite who states that language and religion have been the two most important cultural infrastructures serving as bases for national differentiation and modern demands of autonomy in europe . in the usa , a recent example of the interplay among nationalism , immigration and language took place in dade county , greater miami , from the 1960s until the early 1990s and",
    "is described in the work of @xcite . after the cuban revolution , cuban migration to the usa ,",
    "which main destination was south florida , took place initially in three waves , jan/1959-oct/1962 , sep/1965-apr/1966 ( freedom flights ) and apr - oct/1980 ( mariel boatlift ) , respectively .",
    "the first two waves included skilled workers and high officials of the deposed government , which together with the cold war , was an incentive for american natives to welcome those immigrants . as a result , in 1973 , dade county even declared itself officially bicultural .",
    "however , the third wave was composed of a large amount of working class immigrants , many of them black , triggering nationalism , anti - cuban demonstrations and african american riots in south florida .",
    "those events culminated with voters repealing the bicultural status and dade county declaring that it was unlawful the use of public funds to promote any language other than english or any culture other than that of the usa .",
    "the model developed here might be of interest in countries with a significant foreign population such as the case of luxembourg , whose foreign population jumped from 26.3% ( 1981 ) to 38.1% ( 2003 ) of the total population .",
    "portuguese nationals accounted for 13.7% of the total population in luxembourg in 2003 @xcite .",
    "in such a context , depending on the interaction between foreign individuals and natives ( citizens ) , together with public policy regarding language status and assimilation , nationalism might find a fertile environment to develop and spread . the recent wave of mass immigration of refugees from syria and other countries to europe shows that a study of these issues is of utmost importance .",
    "the contributions of this paper are twofold : ( i ) when nationalism is introduced in the model , results are in line with the literature in the sense that eventually one language might disappear with the entire population becoming monolingual either in the high or low status language . on the other hand , results also show that when bilingualism emerges , it might be related to a completely segregated society with monolingual immigrants and monolingual nationalistic natives .",
    "hence , bilingualism might not be a desired outcome as widespread outlined in the literature so far ; ( ii ) if ideology transition is removed , the model becomes a particular case of @xcite with the extension of @xcite with regard to the contribution of bilinguals to the transition probabilities .",
    "i show that under this framework , bilingualism is never stable , thus results in @xcite are solely due to the way the four conversion rate constants @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( see next section ) are defined in their model , i.e. , without any relation among them .",
    "when the constants are related to each other through language status , bilingualism becomes doomed and disappears in the long run .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , i review some key papers in the literature on ideology struggle and language competition , discussing their main results and limitations .",
    "section 3 presents the model and results discussing the interface between nationalism and language .",
    "section 4 concludes .",
    "models dealing with language competition attracted the interest of physicists particularly after the work of @xcite .",
    "the latter provides a minimal model for language shift , where two languages compete with each other for speakers .",
    "individuals belong to one of two monolingual groups and the population has no spatial structure , i.e. , individuals interact with others at the same rate , thus having each an equal probability in terms of language influence .",
    "languages are assumed as fixed entities , i.e. , grammar , syntax and other structural properties of language do not evolve over time .",
    "the probability of an individual shifting from one language to the other is proportional to the attracting language perceived status and its number of speakers , such that no one shifts to a language with no speakers or no status .",
    "language status increases with the higher social and economic opportunities a typical speaker of a language can obtain .",
    "apart from the strong assumption that no individual is bilingual , one drawback of the model is that both languages can not coexist in equilibrium , which contrasts with the existence of bilingual societies in practice .",
    "the absence of language coexistence was soon overcome in the literature .",
    "although @xcite also ignore the existence of bilingual speakers , they provide an alternative population dynamics setup to that of @xcite , belonging to the family of lotka - volterra models , in which the rate of change of the number of monolingual speakers of each competing language depends not only on a term related to the competition for speakers but also on an additional term taking into account the intrinsic growth rates of each population and their different carrying capacities in the absence of competition .",
    "thus , when speakers from different languages do not interact , each language evolves according to uncoupled verhulst equations towards their carrying capacities in the long run . even assuming that only one language is attractive , when both languages compete for speakers , as long as a threshold condition is satisfied , the only stable equilibrium is one in which both languages coexist .",
    "the threshold condition requires : ( i ) a small and easily reachable carrying capacity of the population speaking the attractive language .",
    "the latter is achievable by increasing the opportunities afforded to the speakers of the low status language , ( ii ) a high growth rate of the speakers of the low status language and ( iii ) a low rate of language shift through minimizing contact between speakers of the two different languages .",
    "while language death seems to be a quite important issue and the model of @xcite displays a good fit with historical data for endangered languages such as scottish gaelic , quechua and welsh , which appear to be on track for extinction in the future , their model is unable to explain cases of successful bilingualism such as that of spain with the survival of catalan , galician and vasco , together with castilian , even after the francoist period during which only the latter was officially allowed .",
    "apart from the attempt of @xcite to explain such a puzzle , @xcite also studied the issue of language coexistence and went one step further by introducing a group of bilingual speakers .",
    "their work was particularly motivated by the language context in the region of galicia ( northwest of spain ) where there exists a bilingual majority alongside galician and castilian monolingual minorities . differently from @xcite where the endangered languages are very different from the high status language , galician and castilian are very similar and @xcite",
    "extend the model of @xcite by incorporating a parameter to account for the similarity between both competing languages . taking into account two populations of monolinguals and one of bilingual speakers , therefore modelling the evolution of the three groups over time through a system of two coupled differential equations",
    ", their model reduces to the model in @xcite if bilinguals do not exist and both languages are completely different . as in @xcite ,",
    "the language transition probabilities are proportional to the attracting language status and its share of speakers in the total population , with bilinguals also contributing to the share .",
    "transitions are possible between any group , i.e. , @xmath4 ; @xmath5 ; @xmath6 ; @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ; @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent respectively each of the two monolingual and the bilingual groups .",
    "their main finding is that , given the status of both competing languages , if a minimum threshold for language similarity is satisfied , bilingualism becomes a stable equilibrium in which the bilingual group survives in the long run together with the group of monolingual individuals speaking the high - status language , thus the low - status language survives among the speakers of the former group .",
    "hence , the model of @xcite was successful in modelling both monolingual and bilingual speakers plus the survival of bilingualism while it could still reproduce the results in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , two important criticisms were discussed in @xcite .",
    "firstly , when no monolingual speaker of one of the competing languages remains , there would be no advantage conferred to bilinguals and the latter should disappear in the long run . also , regarding the possibility of direct language shift between @xmath10 and @xmath11-speakers and vice - versa , such transitions would be very unlike in the real world as those would involve the simultaneous loss of one language and the acquisition of the competing one , i.e. , children would acquire a different language from the one of their parents , in some cases making communication between them impossible . or monolingual adults learning a new language would simultaneously forget their native language . in order to overcome those pertinent limitations , @xcite extend the model in @xcite accounting for a bilingual group as in @xcite and they introduce a distinction between horizontal and vertical transmission of language",
    "their mechanism of language transmission is more restrictive than that of @xcite given they do not allow for direct transitions between monolingual groups . in terms of vertical transmission , they assume children of monolingual parents necessarily acquire the language of their parents as their first language while children of bilingual parents may acquire either or both of the competing languages , thus the following group transitions are allowed : @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; @xmath8 ; @xmath9 and @xmath15 . regarding horizontal transmission , they assume bilingual adults remain bilingual throughout their lifetimes while monolingual adults may either remain monolingual or learn a second language .",
    "thus , transitions @xmath15 ; @xmath5 ; @xmath7 ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are allowed .",
    "based on these assumptions , a three - state model similar to that in @xcite is built , where the rate of change of the proportion of each of the three groups in the total population follows the vertical and horizontal language transmission mechanisms with probability @xmath16 ( mortality rate , when adults are replaced by children ) and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "thus , transition from monolingualism to bilingualism necessarily takes place through horizontal transmission and transition in the opposite direction is made through vertical transmission .",
    "the system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) modelling the evolution of monolinguals and bilinguals is then given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the status of language @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( as in @xcite ) , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the conversion rate from group @xmath23 to group @xmath28 which can be associated with the level of educational resources available in a particular language or the rate of interaction between pairs of individuals belonging to groups @xmath23 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a parameter accounting for how the attractiveness of language @xmath23 scales with the share of its speakers .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath29 to cluster about 1.31 while in @xcite and @xcite the value is assumed to be 1 , i.e. , the attractiveness of a language increases linearly in the proportion of its speakers .",
    "one difference between @xcite and @xcite is that in the former the transition probabilities are influenced only by the number of monolingual speakers of the language being acquired , thus bilinguals play no role on such probabilities .",
    "this follows an interpretation where , in addition to being able to communicate with both @xmath23 monolinguals and bilinguals , the @xmath23 monolingual adult who subsequently acquires language @xmath28 can additionally communicate with @xmath28 monolinguals , therefore only the proportion of monolingual speakers of @xmath28 matters .",
    "the system of odes has two stable equilibria , both associated with monolingualism and there are two critical unstable points , one related to pure bilingualism and another in which individuals from all three groups survive and co - exist .",
    "thus , the base model of @xcite shares the same prediction as in @xcite , i.e. , one of the two competing languages will eventually become extinct .",
    "on the other hand , an additional stable fixed point can be created in the interior of the phase space by adopting a mechanism of intervention in which , when the proportion of speakers of the endangered language falls below a given threshold , the status of the endangered language is increased and the @xmath30-coefficients are adjusted such that the conversion rates from bilingualism to both monolingual groups are increased and the conversion rates regarding transitions in the other direction are decreased ( i.e. , the likelihood that all three groups survive increases by making the two languages become more isolated with incentives for monolingual education of children ) .    as can be seen ,",
    "both models in @xcite and @xcite require some sort of policy intervention for bilingual sustainability . a successful attempt to model language competition in which both the vertical and horizontal mechanisms of language transmission are respected and bilingualism can be sustainable without any form of intervention is proposed in @xcite .",
    "they also present a three - state model but with distinct transition probabilities between groups than those of @xcite . with such novel dynamics , bilingualism is asymptotically stable .",
    "they modify the model in @xcite as follows : @xmath31 where the parameters @xmath32 combine effects such as mortality rate and language status .",
    "@xmath33 $ ] represent respectively the importance of bilinguals as representatives of languages @xmath11 and @xmath10 to the monolinguals of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is particularly important when the two competing languages have significant different statuses because in such a case the bilingual community would consist mainly of bilinguals coming from the low status language group and individuals from the high status language might not have an interest in learning the low status one ( e.g. : if the @xmath11-language has a very low status , @xmath34 would be very low given that @xmath12 would be mainly composed of @xmath11-speakers who learned the high status @xmath10-language , thus bilingualism would be associated with the high importance of the @xmath10-language ) . in this framework ,",
    "bilinguals play a role in the language transition probabilities as in @xcite but in a more reasonable way .",
    "note that parameter @xmath29 in the above system is set to @xmath35 , giving a lotka - volterra - type model .",
    "the dynamics leads bilingualism to be asymptotically stable whenever @xmath34 and @xmath36 are high enough such that they are simultaneously above critical values , i.e. , the first necessary condition for stable bilingualism requires bilinguals to be sufficiently regarded by monolinguals of one language as members of the monolingual community of the competing language . the former condition for bilingualism can only be fulfilled if transitions from bilinguals to monolinguals are more rare than the opposite transitions , thus in contrast with @xcite . also ,",
    "while in @xcite bilingualism survives through bilinguals taking over the entire population , in @xcite when bilingualism survives , all three groups coexist .    from the discussion",
    "so far , it can be seen that the seminal model of @xcite has been subsequently refined in the literature over time , with the incorporation of more realistic assumptions in an attempt to prove that bilingualism can be sustained in the long run , i.e. , a low - status language is not necessarily doomed .",
    "although some of the papers cited above were successful in this task , their policy recommendations display some clashing directions .",
    "moreover , in the present work , i show that this sort of obsession with bilingualism might not be a positive issue in some contexts , particularly when there is an interplay between the issues of ideology struggle and language competition on society .",
    "language competition and ideology struggle can be connected not only on the sociological level but also in terms of modelling given that lotka - volterra - type models can be also found in the literature predicting the evolution of competing ideologies over time . in @xcite a model for ideological competition in a country with growing population is formulated .",
    "the evolution of the aggregate population follows the verhulst law and individuals are divided in @xmath37 groups , each with a different specific ideology , plus one ideology - free group .",
    "the number of individuals belonging to each of these @xmath37 ideological groups evolves according to the following lotka - volterra equation : @xmath38 where the first term accounts for the death of followers of ideology @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "the second term accounts for the so - called unitary conversion from ideology @xmath28 to ideology @xmath23 , i.e. , conversion motivated by the information environment such as newspapers and election speeches .",
    "@xmath40 reflects the intensity of conversion and the latter is also proportional to the number of followers of ideology @xmath28 , thus there is no direct contact between followers of different ideologies .",
    "the remaining term takes into account binary conversion , which is the one due to direct interaction between members of two ideologies , thus proportional to @xmath41 , with intensity @xmath42 .",
    "thus , a model unifying the impact of both ideology and language on society is presented in the next section .",
    "the background of language and ideology competition is based on @xcite .",
    "the latter uses a different type of model based on evolutionary game theory to study how nationalism and assimilation evolve among natives and immigrants , respectively , assuming that the latter group comes from the same origin country . in the host country ,",
    "the population of natives is divided in two groups , one which members welcome immigrants and another which members display nationalistic behaviour and try to restrict the access of immigrants to public services . on the side of immigrants , there are also two groups : one which members display an interest to learn the native language of the host country , thus making an attempt to become culturally assimilated while the other group does not learn .",
    "when immigrants do not live in an enclave , thus being dispersed across the host country , depending on the parameters of the model , a dynamics of lotka - volterra type is obtained , with nationalism and immigrant assimilation oscillating over time .",
    "in contrast , in the present work , using a different framework , an asymptotically stable equilibrium is found .",
