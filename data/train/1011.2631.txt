    "the significance of limb darkening as a probe of atmospheric structure was recognized from the earliest modelling of stellar atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and its importance in the quantitative photometric analysis of eclipsing binaries similarly noted @xcite .",
    "reliable empirical determinations of limb darkening are rarely possible in eclipsing binaries ( in part because of degeneracies with other parameters ) , and so values derived from model - atmosphere calculations retain their importance through to the present day , where new applications include modelling of exoplanetary transits , microlensing events , and spatially resolved stellar surfaces ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ".    wholesale calculation of limb - darkening coefficients became feasible only after production of the first large grids of model atmospheres ( cf .",
    "* who review earlier studies ) .",
    "in particular , the extensive model - atmosphere grids generated by @xcite form the basis of work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "although several programs are now available in the public domain for generating line - blanketed model atmospheres which relax the approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , kurucz s  codes remain the benchmark for lte calculations , and have two major attractions for the present purposes .",
    "first , while the models may not accurately reproduce individual spectral lines for which non - lte effects are significant , they nonetheless appear to be quite successful in generating accurate atmospheric structures and broad - band fluxes .    secondly , it is straightforward , and computationally cheap , to generate self - consistent  grids covering large ranges in parameters of interest .",
    "the aspect of internal consistency is of particular importance when modelling the spectra of systems whose temperatures and gravities may show considerable variations over their surfaces ( such as the components of close binary systems , rapidly rotating stars , and non - radial pulsators ) , and when attempting uniform analyses of samples encompassing a range of stellar parameters ( for example , in synoptic studies of light - curves of exoplanetary transits ) .",
    "almost all extensive calculations of grids of -based limb - darkening coefficients published to date have used the formulations of opacity - distribution functions ( odfs ) and atmospheric convection inherent to the models published by @xcite . however , improved treatements in both areas have emerged subsequently , leading in some cases to quite significant changes in the models @xcite .",
    "the principal purpose of the present paper is to present calculations of limb - darkening coefficients made using new odfs and improved parameterizations of convection .",

    "the baseline models use solar abundances reported by @xcite .",
    "limb darkening plays an important role in the analysis of light - curves of stars with transiting exoplanets , and the sample of such stars currently known shows a propensity for enhanced metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with this in mind , additional models ( and odfs ) were calculated with metallicities enhanced by + 0.3 and + 0.5 dex over solar values . for test purposes ,",
    "odfs ( but not model grids ) were computed at several other metallicities , including [ m / h ] = @xmath3 for the vega models discussed in section  [ sec : phot1 ] .",
    "the routine study of eclipsing binaries in external galaxies , and especially in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , has become feasible in recent years .",

    "the principal motivation for the work reported here was to provide up - to - date limb - darkening coefficients ( particularly at mc abundances ) .",

    "these are provided in condensed form as broad - band limb - darkening coefficients .",
    "physical fluxes , @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the eddington flux ) , are required as a check on the accuracy of intensity integrations , and in any case represent only a minor additional computational overhead .",
    "model fluxes are therefore also provided , both at the 1221 wavelengths used in the structure calculations ( 91160@xmath17 m ) , and in broad - band ( ` synthetic photometry ' ) form .",

    "specific intensities are traditionally , and conveniently , characterized by simple functional forms , of which the most venerable is the linear limb - darkening law @xmath28 the analytical solution for a source function that is linear in optical depth @xmath29 ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xmath30 for a grey atmosphere ) .",
    "more - realistic models do not have analytical solutions , and additional terms are required for a faithful functional representation of actual limb darkening .",
    "@xcite took a series - expansion approach , and found the differences between quadratic and quartic approximations to be negligible at the level of accuracy with which he was concerned .",
    "two - coefficient parameterizations subsequently became standard ; in particular , a quadratic law of the form @xmath31 was widely adopted in the modern computational era ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although a cubic version , @xmath32 was advocated by @xcite .",
    "an alternative logarithmic law , @xmath33 was proposed by @xcite , and a square - root law , @xmath34 by @xcite .    for modern work ,",
    "these limb - darkening laws suffer from various limitations . the obvious way to develop a single analytical expression that more accurately reproduces numerical limb - darkening results across a wide parameter space is simply to use more terms , a notion implemented by @xcite who introduced a four - coefficient fit in powers of @xmath35 , @xmath36    figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the differing degrees to which the foregoing common functional forms reproduce the intensities computed here .",
    "while quantitative results depend on the chosen normalization and adopted figure of merit , the qualitative conclusions are robust : a linear limb - darkening law is a rather poor representation of detailed numerical results ; a quadratic law fares little better ; but the four - coefficient law affords an improvement of up to an order of magnitude in precision over any standard two - coefficient option . while there has been some discussion in the literature as to which is the most appropriate limb - darkening ` law ' to adopt for light - curve analyses , and in particular under circumstances which permit empirical determination of limb - darkening coefficients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there seems little justification for adopting anything other than a high - order fit such as eqtn .",
    "( [ eq06 ] ) if the principal purpose is to secure an accurate representation of model - atmosphere results .      for any given analytical form , there remains a choice of numerical technique for determining the limb - darkening coefficients .",
    "the most direct approach is simple least - squares determination of coefficients from functional fits to computed @xmath37 values ( with @xmath38 , the fitted value of @xmath39 , as an optional additional free parameter ) . a related approach , the @xmath40-integration method @xcite , appears to offer no significant benefits @xcite .",
    "a criticism that can be levelled against the least - squares method is that subsequent integration of parameterized intensities may not accurately recover the flux , as it should ( eqtn .",
    "[ eq : flux ] ) .",
    "alternative formulations in which which flux is explicitly conserved can be devised ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that vega is a rapid rotator viewed pole - on @xcite , so that in principle no single - temperature model can give an accurate representation of the entire flux distribution ( although for magnitude zero - point calibration this is of minor importance , because the models are only used to scale between 5556-  and @xmath91-band fluxes ) .",
