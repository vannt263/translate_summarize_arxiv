    "andreev reflection @xcite , the celebrated phenomenon which alexander andreev introduced in 1964 to explain the increased resistance in heat flow through a normal metal  superconductor interface , took three decades to be demonstrated in superfluid @xmath0he - b @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , during the more recent past it has become one of the prime tools to study the zero temperature limit , @xmath5 , of this charge - neutral p - wave fermion system . if the temperature is sufficiently low , so that collisions between quasiparticle excitations are practically absent in the bulk volume and ballistic propagation prevails , then measurements with vibrating sensors typically prominently display characteristic signatures from andreev reflection .",
    "rotation is another central research tool of superfluid @xmath0he . during the past decade",
    "it has been applied at ever lower temperatures so that andreev reflection measurements have become possible even in rotating flow .",
    "research on rotating @xmath0he superfluids has been centered in helsinki since the early 1980ies and has been vital for exploring the many different forms of quantized vorticity , both the structure as well as the dynamics .",
    "alexander andreev was one of the original founders of this research effort .",
    "a well - known example of andreev reflection , originally demonstrated with vibrating wire resonators by the lancaster group in 2001 @xcite , is shown in fig .",

    "two mechanical oscillators in close proximity to each other are vibrating in a bath of superfluid @xmath0he - b .",
    "one of them is driven at high displacement amplitude such that its strong vibrations generate a turbulent tangle of quantized vortices which shrouds both vibrators .",
    "the second vibrator is driven at low amplitude such that its output measures the damping of its oscillations by the thermal ( but ballistic ) quasiparticles . in spite of the heat input by the generator and the resulting increased overall number of excitations , the detector , shielded by the cloud of tangled vortices",
    ", displays reduced damping : it is hit by fewer quasiparticles from the surrounding cloud of thermal excitations and thus records a lower apparent temperature .",
    "this counterintuitive result is caused by the andreev retroreflection shadow cast by the vortex tangle .",

    "a drive with square wave envelope at high amplitude is fed to one of the forks which generates a turbulent vortex tangle .",
    "the tangle spreads around the two forks and casts an andreev shadow which is recorded as reduced damping by the second sensor fork driven at a one order of magnitude lower excitation amplitude . ]",
    "the example in fig .",
    "[ andreevdemo ] @xcite demonstrates the possibilities of using andreev reflection for the study of a clean fermi system in the very low temperature limit .",
    "this work and the development of the appropriate techniques has long been the domain of the lancaster group @xcite .",
    "more recently the ultra - low temperature regime of @xmath0he - b has moved in the forefront of general interest when it was realized that conventional sub - mk refrigeration techniques by means of adiabatic demagnetization cooling of copper are quite adequate if the total heat leak to the sample volume can be reduced to below @xmath7pw .",
    "this recognition has led to the development of new measuring techniques for the ballistic regime in superfluid @xmath0he which are based on the use of mechanical vibrating resonance devices @xcite or the existence of a novel coherently precessing nmr mode @xcite .",
    "such work has been driven by the hope to reveal explicit new information on andreev reflection , or on the existence of andreev bound states on surfaces , interfaces , and vortex cores , or the expectation to identify the majorana character in the spectrum of the bound state excitations @xcite .    today the experimental tools for making use of andreev reflection consist of a quasiparticle radiator , a box with a heating element coupled to the @xmath0he - b bath via a small orifice which defines the beam , and a sensor in the bath , which traditionally has been a highly sensitive vibrating wire resonator .",
    "more recently the mass - produced quartz tuning fork oscillator @xcite has been found to have sufficient sensitivity as a quasiparticle detector and because of its easier use and insensitivity to magnetic fields it has gained in popularity .",
    "the theoretical basis of andreev reflection in superfluid @xmath0he , with emphasis on the phenomena arising from the spin - triplet and orbital p - wave pairing , was laid out in an early review of kurkijrvi and rainer .",
    "the present brief overview discusses measurements on andreev reflection in the rotating b phase , describing how andreev reflection can be used to study quantized vortex lines and their dynamics .",
    "this is an obvious area where andreev reflection measurements have great potential , especially concerning quantum turbulence , the peculiar characteristic of superfluid flow in the limit of weak mutual friction damping , which has been in the focus of recent interest @xcite .",
    "originally andreev reflection measurements in rotation became necessary as a means to calibrate reflection from quantized line vortices @xcite .",
    "this provides the starting point for the discussion below .",
    "the same experimental setup can also be used to record the dynamic response of a rotating vortex array .",
    "the most common type of such measurements is the determination of the response to a sudden stop of the rotation drive .",
    "based on our knowledge of superfluid flows in @xmath8he , it has been thought that laminar flow of quantized line vortices becomes unstable in the limit of vanishing mutual friction : when @xmath9 any minute perturbations in the flow can lead to instabilities and cause a tangle of vortices to be formed , so that new dissipation mechanisms become available , primarily fueled by reconnections between neighbouring vortices .",
    "andreev reflection provides one of the means to monitor the flow of vortices .",
    "recent measurements on the rate of vortex annihilation after a sudden reduction of the rotation velocity have shown that in @xmath0he - b turbulence is not necessarily the only form of response @xcite .",
    "depending on the geometry , surface properties , etc .",
    ", one finds that the rate of vortex decay in cylindrically symmetric flow may correspond to the slow mutual friction damping of laminar flow or to a faster process brought about by additional turbulent dissipation mechanisms .",
    "some of these studies will be discussed below .",
    "the theory of andreev reflection is particularly straightforward in the ballistic temperature regime , as has been demonstrated by barenghi et al .",

    "the upper limit for the impact parameter , where retroreflection can still occur , is @xmath36 its magnitude is of order @xmath37 for thermal quasiparticles ( with @xmath38 ) and thus the andreev shadow of the vortex becomes experimentally significant , even though it is restricted to only one side of the vortex for one species of excitations . in practice",
    "rotating measurements proceed in the low - density limit where the andreev shadows of neighbouring vortices can be considered approximately additive . for denser",
    "3-dimensional turbulent vortex structures the problem of tracing the excitation trajectories becomes complex @xcite , the total andreev shadow can not be estimated from the contribution of single vortices , and one has to resort to numerical monte - carlo - type simulation calculations .",
    "for quantitative experimental measurements a controlled setup with an oriented beam of quasiparticles and a well - known distribution of vortices is required . in the experiment of fig .",
    "[ andreevdemo ] , for instance , the usual assumption is that the vortex tangle is homogeneous and isotropic in all directions @xcite .",
    "this is a simplification , since the prongs of the tuning fork oscillator vibrate in antiphase in the plane in which they are contained .",
    "when the fork excitation is increased above a critical value , vortex rings are generated and shed off from the prongs .",
    "the rings propagate with their self - velocity @xmath39 , and because of the spread in their size distribution , they ultimately collide forming a tangle via reconnections @xcite . owing to the oriented motion of the prongs , the ejection pattern of the rings is not isotropic and thus the orientational homogeneity or the spatial extent of the tangle are not expected to be uniform @xcite . as andreev reflection depends on both the configuration and density of vortices with respect to the incident quasiparticle beam , a better controlled measurement is needed for calibration purposes .",
    "this can be achieved using the rotating equilibrium state in a cylindrical container ( fig .",
    "[ expscheme ] ) . here",
    "the configuration is fixed and the number of vortices @xmath40 can be externally adjusted by manipulating the angular rotation velocity @xmath41 , which controls the aerial density @xmath42 and thus the inter - vortex distance @xmath43 of the rectilinear line vortices in the rotating cylinder of radius @xmath44 .",
    "= 0 ) on the left , all excitations which are not scattered back through the orifice ( owing to diffuse scattering processes on the walls ) are thermalized in the heat exchanger at the bottom . in rotation ( @xmath45 ) on the right ,",
    "part of the beam is andreev reflected from the equilibrium vortex state below the orifice and the density of excitations above the orifice is increased . ]    in rotation metastability in the total number of vortices can arise from the presence of a non - negligible critical angular velocity increment @xmath46 .",
    "it determines the flow velocity at the cylindrical wall at which a vortex is formed , while rotation is increased : @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this process controls the total number of vortices in increasing rotation , while the density is fixed to the equilibrium rotation value @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , annihilation of vortices on the cylindrical container wall is not associated with any appreciable energy barrier @xcite .",
    "thus the reference state is preferably formed making use of the threshold to annihilation and not of vortex formation , which means that our rotating reference state is the equilibrium vortex state where the centrally located vortex cluster is surrounded and separated from the cylindrical wall by a vortex - free confining annulus of width @xmath48 which in practice is usually the minimum possible width @xcite and only slightly larger than the inter - vortex distance : @xmath49 .",
    "so far in the very low temperature measurements the inter - vortex distance is much larger , with @xmath50 mm , than the radius of the andreev shadow [ eq .  ( [ r - c ] ) ] .",
    "the recipe to create the equilibrium vortex state with @xmath51 vortices is to increase rotation well above the target velocity and then to decrease @xmath41 so that vortices have annihilated when the desired value of @xmath41 is reached .",
    "these operations are preferably performed at high mutual friction above @xmath52 and subsequently the sample is cooled at constant rotation to the desired temperature .",
    "this precaution becomes necessary since after annihilation the remaining vortex array relaxes to its equilibrium configuration which at the lowest mutual friction values is a slow process requiring hours .        in the setup of fig .",
    "[ setup ] , the rotating cylinder is compartmentalized with two division walls in three sections .",
    "the lower division wall with a small orifice of 0.3 mm diameter is the main thermal resistance along the cylindrical tower .",
    "it is used to measure the change in the quasiparticle density above the orifice as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "the upper large orifice of 0.75 mm diameter restricts the flow of vortices from the middle section to the uppermost compartment . in the uppermost section",
    "the critical velocity is defined by the smooth fused quartz walls of the cylinder so that it is characterized by a high value @xmath53 rad / s .",
    "it can be rotated in the metastable vortex - free state , the so - called landau state , up to @xmath54 . in contrast",
    ", the lowermost section has a rough bottom of sintered copper powder which reduces its critical velocity to @xmath55 rad / s .",
    "likewise , the middle section with the two quartz tuning fork oscillators and their leads has a reduced @xmath46 .",
    "thus after rotational deceleration , when vortices have been annihilated , one will find the equilibrium vortex state in the two lower sections , while in the uppermost section the vortex number can be adjusted to have any value between @xmath56 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , the heat flow carried by quasiparticle excitations moves along the tower towards the sintered heat exchanger which is always the coldest place , the heat sink .",
    "the dominant thermal resistance which it encounters is the orifice of 0.3 mm diameter in the lower division plate .",
    "it defines the quasiparticle beam for the andreev reflection measurement . when the heater fork is activated , a net heat current @xmath57 is carried through the orifice to the lowermost section .",
    "this current is produced by the residual heat leak @xmath58 and the heater power @xmath59 . in rotation",
    "the current is reduced by the andreev reflection from vortices @xmath51 in the lowermost section .",
    "the measurement of a carefully prepared reference state with @xmath51 vortices is started by demagnetizing the nuclear cooling stage until the thermometer above the lower orifice stops cooling at about @xmath60 , _ ie .",
    "_ when its temperature is fixed by the residual heat leak @xmath61 and the thermal resistance of the 0.3 mm aperture",
    ". thereafter the demagnetization cooling is continued at a much reduced rate , to maintain constant conditions . in this situation",
    "the temperature below the orifice is much lower , typically @xmath62 , as measured in the absence of the 0.3 mm orifice , owing to good thermal contact via the heat exchange sinter to the nuclear cooling stage .",
    "thus the reverse current of thermal excitations upwards from the lowest section can be neglected and the temperature rise above the orifice depends on the heating delivered by the heater fork and on the rotation velocity , which controls both the andreev reflection from the vortices below the orifice and the rotation - dependent heat leak to the two compartments above the orifice . by recording the temperature rise as a function of the power @xmath59 fed to the heater fork , it becomes possible to extract the thermal resistance at the given rotation velocity @xmath41 and by comparing resistances measured at different @xmath41 , ultimately the andreev reflection .",
    "the thermometer fork is selected to have small effective mass and a small intrinsic resonance width . in the ballistic temperature regime",
    "its damping at low excitation level measures the exponentially vanishing quasiparticle density . following the analysis of the vibrating wire thermometer , as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , the resonance width @xmath63 of the fork output is approximated as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the intrinsic zero temperature resonance width . in practice , in the regime of linear response with",
    "well - behaved lorentzian resonance line shape it is often sufficient to monitor the resonance amplitude , _",
    "i.e. _ the in- and out - of - phase signals so that the resonance amplitude and frequency can be recovered , instead of performing complete frequency sweeps across the resonance to measure the width @xmath66 directly .",
    "the zero temperature width @xmath67 is typically measured in vacuum at the lowest possible temperature  here at about 10mk .",
    "its value depends on the type of device , its preparation , mounting , and measuring circuitry , since at best @xmath68mhz which corresponds to a q value as high as @xmath69 or more .",
    "thus its measurement is a delicate matter , as well as its stability after changes in mounting or simply from one cool down to the next . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath67 was determined from in situ measurements of the relaxation rate of trapped magnon condensates as a function of temperature : the result @xmath70mhz was found to agree well with the low - temperature vacuum value of @xmath67 . in ref .",
    "@xcite a tuning fork of similar size and properties was deduced to have @xmath71hz by comparison against a vibrating wire resonator .",
    "this value was twice higher than 0.07hz measured in vacuum at 1.5k .",
    "for the temperature calibration one needs additionally one reliable temperature reading to fix the second calibration constant @xmath72 .",
    "accurate and at the same time convenient temperature calibration of the fork thermometer is not a straightforward task since a temperature reading from the ballistic regime requires a stable calibration point around @xmath73 or less , where the inevitable temperature difference between an outside thermometer and the @xmath0he sample can be large and difficult to estimate .",
    "here @xmath72 was estimated by extrapolating readings at around @xmath74 , by comparison to a @xmath0he melting pressure thermometer , which is thermally anchored to the copper nuclear cooling stage , or to b - phase nmr frequency shifts measured in the top @xmath0he compartment in fig .",

    "one might think that other similar forks would faithfully display the same value , since it is expected to depend only on the density of quartz , on geometrical factors , and the fermi momentum @xmath79 .",
    "however , the matter appears to be more complicated : two different forks with similar dimensions and properties as that of ref .",
    "@xcite were used for thermometry in the present rotating measurements with @xmath80khz and 9.4khz at 0.5bar pressure , _ i.e. _ a sensitivity reduced by a factor of 4 . in ref .",
    "@xcite a larger fork with prongs of @xmath81mm@xmath76 cross section and 3.1 mm length was found to have sensitivity reduced by an order of magnitude from that expected according to the calibration recipe offered in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the pressure dependence appears to scale @xmath82 as expected , since the fork with @xmath80khz at 0.5bar was calibrated at 29bar pressure to have @xmath83khz .",
    "the ratio of these two values is close to the expected number 1.54 .    in fig .",
    "[ tempresponse ] we see an example of the temperature response when the excitation of the heater fork is suddenly switched from zero to 6pw . the time constant is slow , about 25s , determined by the thermal rc time constant of the bolometer , and not by the one order of magnitude faster response which would correspond to the inverse of the resonance width of the thermometer fork",

    "are deviations from cylindrical flow symmetry owing to the presence of tuning forks or their wires .",
    "it is the two turbulent responses in fig .",
    "[ turbulentsignal ] which we discuss next .",
    "as the tuning fork monitors the evolution of the local excitation density , other sources than the direct increased dissipation from turbulent vortex decay can also contribute to the signals .",
    "for instance , after deceleration the residual heat leak from mechanical vibrations is reduced by @xmath173 because of its @xmath41-dependence , as seen in fig .",
    "[ thermalcurrentdata ] .",
    "this reduction is little if at all visible in signal ( a ) , but explains about half of the drop from the initial to the final signal level in the case of ( b ) .",
    "the second half of the overall signal level change in ( b ) is explained by the andreev reflection from the initial equilibrium vortex state , which is not present in the final state at @xmath174 . to create the initial sharp peaks from sources other than the turbulence",
    "requires that the deceleration itself generates a pulse of heating .",
    "for instance , the rotation of the cryostat displays mechanical resonances with increased vibrational heating at certain fixed rotation velocities .",
    "however , these resonances require time to build up which is not available during the rapid deceleration . one can assure oneself about the correctness of such considerations by recording the spin - down signals at different deceleration rates . in short",
    "we conclude that the rapidly evolving peaks predominantly characterize the turbulence , but their quantitative analysis is both complicated and different for the two cases in fig .",
    "[ turbulentsignal ] .",
    "if the sinter surface is the main destabilizing effect , then the turbulence is spatially restricted to the vicinity of the bottom surface , as shown by simulation calculations of the free spin down at the ab interface @xcite . in a long cylinder the volume filled with turbulent tangle and displaying increased dissipation may be assumed to be of similar extension above the ab interface and above a rough sinter surface .",
    "however , as the two signals in fig .",
    "[ turbulentsignal ] have been measured in different setups , they display the turbulence differently , primarily since the thermal coupling to the heat sink differs by more than two orders in magnitude . the slower setup ( b )",
    "was found to have a thermal time constant of 25s in fig .",
    "[ tempresponse ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ turbulentsignal ] , the recovery from peak output is not obeying this time constant of the bolometer but takes place on a slower time scale which is determined by the turbulent decay .",
    "the bolometric design of setup ( b ) with the 0.3 mm diameter orifice emphasizes the increase in fork damping owing to andreev reflection from the turbulent tangle .",
    "thus this signal is more closely related to the time evolution of the density and polarization of the decaying vortices , in particular to the total line length deflected towards the plane transverse to the original rotation axis .",
    "since the overall polarization of the vortices changes continuously , while the tangle evolves , the andreev reflection signal has a complicated origin . in the more open geometry of setup (",
    "a ) good thermal contact ensures rapid response @xcite and direct heat generation by the turbulence is the dominant source for this output .",
    "summarizing we note that the short burst of turbulence leads to an accelerated decay of vortices , when compared to the slow laminar decay which dominates the later spin down . the turbulent instability sets in when deceleration is started and causes vortex lines to reconnect and to form a turbulent tangle .",
    "this increases the heat release and the total vortex length .",
    "both features are monitored by the fork signals : ( 1 ) the peak in the reconnection rate and dissipation is reached early , already during the deceleration or immediately at its end , depending on the initial rotation @xmath172 .",
    "subsequently the turbulent dissipation decreases rapidly , as seen from signal ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ turbulentsignal ] .",
    "( 2 ) the peak in turbulent vortex length develops slower as well as its subsequent decay , as monitored by signal ( b ) .",
    "the decay of the turbulence proceeds by means of a series of mechanisms . at the outer length scale of the flow disturbance and the turbulent instability ,",
    "the kinetic energy resides in eddies formed from bundles of approximately aligned vortices .",

    "it would seem that spin - down in a cylinder with mostly laminar flow of the superfluid component has little to do with full - blown homogeneous turbulence , since reconnections and tangle formation are substantially reduced owing to the high degree of polarization of the vortices along the cylinder axis .",

    "a direct comparison with @xmath0he - b would be valuable , in order to compare to a situation when turbulence is less prevalent .",
    "the zero temperature limit of the fermi superfluid @xmath0he - b , with ballistic quasiparticle transport and no bulk - volume impurity scattering , is in the forefront of current fermion physics in condensed matter , since many new phenomena are here expected to come together .",
