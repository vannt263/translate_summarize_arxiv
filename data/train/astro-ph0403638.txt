    "while the first  year wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) data imply that the primordial density fluctuations at @xmath3 are virtually gaussian @xcite , the present structure traced by galaxies shows significant non - gaussianity .",
    "such non - gaussian features naturally arise during the course of nonlinear gravitational evolution of dark - matter density fields , the formation of luminous galaxies and their subsequent evolution .",
    "therefore , the degree and nature of non - gaussian signatures in the galaxy distribution will provide important empirical constraints on the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) is the lowest - order unambiguous statistic to characterize such non - gaussianities .",
    "the determination of the 3pcf of galaxies was pioneered by @xcite using the lick and zwicky angular catalogs of galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the 3pcf @xmath4 obeys the following _ hierarchical relation _ : @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 being a constant , and @xmath7 is the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) .",
    "the value of @xmath6 in real space de - projected from these angular catalogues is @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "although subsequent analyses of redshift catalogs confirmed the hierarchical relation , at least approximately , the value of @xmath10 ( in redshift space ) appears to be smaller , @xmath11 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; jing , brner 1998 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the luminosity dependence of @xmath12 , and found a small , but significant , trend that brighter galaxies tend to have a lower amplitude than fainter ones .",
    "n - body simulations and perturbative analysis generally predict that the 3pcf should depart from the hierarchical relation , especially on non - linear scales ( fry 1984 ; suto , matsubara 1994 ; jing , brner 1997 ; barriga , gaztaaga 2002 ) .",
    "however , matsubara & suto ( 1994 ) demonstrated that redshift distortions substantially reduce the scale - dependence of @xmath6 , resulting in @xmath10 ( @xmath12 in redshift space ) being nearly constant . still , the amplitude of the @xmath10 of galaxies is roughly ( 50% @xmath13 100% ) smaller than predicted by n - body simulations .",
    "the discrepancy is likely to be the effect of biasing .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a phenomenological model to predict the 3pcf as a function of the galaxy properties , which is based on the halo model .",
    "they argue that the color dependence of @xmath6 should be strong , i.e. , the galaxy biasing severely affects the 3pcfs .",
    "there are several statistics that are closely related to the 3pcf , e.g. , the reduced moments of counts in cells , such as skewness and kurtosis ( see @xcite , 2004 in preparation ) .",
    "another similar statistics is the bispectrum , which is the fourier counterpart of the 3pcf .",
    "recently , @xcite computed the bispectrum of the 2df galaxy redshift survey , and concluded that the non - linear bias is consistent with zero . the other complementary approach to quantify the non - gaussianity in the sdss galaxies by means of topological analysis ( i.e. , in terms of the minkowski functionals ) was already conducted ( hoyle et al .",
    "2002 ; hikage et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the above results are largely consistent with that predicted from purely gravitational nonlinearity , while a weak morphological difference is marginally detected ( e.g. , figure 13 of @xcite ) . here",
    ", we report on the first results of characterizing the non - gaussianity in the sdss galaxy samples using 3pcfs in redshift space .",
    "in particular , we consider the dependence of 3pcfs on the morphology , color , and luminosity of galaxies by constructing volume - limited samples so as to avoid possible systematics due to the selection function . a separate companion paper by nichol et al .",
    "( in preparation ) focuses on a detailed comparison of 3pcfs between the 2df ( jing , brner 2004 ) and the sdss galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes our volume - limited sample of sdss galaxies and the morphology and color classification methods .",
    "the measurements of 3pcfs are detailed in section 3 with particular attention given to their dependence on the morphology , color and luminosity of galaxies .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in section 4 .",
    "we compare several different estimators of 2pcfs and 3pcfs in appendix . throughout the data analysis",
    ", we adopt the following set of cosmological parameters : the matter density parameter , @xmath14 ; the dimensionless cosmological constant , @xmath15 ; and the hubble constant in units of 100km / s / mpc , @xmath16 .",
    "it is expected that galaxy clustering depends on the intrinsic properties of the galaxy samples under consideration , including their morphological types , colors , and luminosities .",
    "therefore , a straightforward analysis of magnitude - limited samples must be interpreted with caution because several different effects may be simultaneously involved .",
    "the magnitude - limited sample of sdss galaxies enables us to construct volume - limited samples of different luminosities , morphologies and colors .",
    "this essentially removes the above difficulties while keeping a statistically significant number of galaxies in each sample .",
    "our present analysis is based on a subset of the sdss galaxy redshift data , ` large ",
    "scale structure sample 12 ' ( blanton et al . in preparation ) , which is larger by a factor of 1.8 than the public data release one @xcite .",

    "the completeness reaches 80% and the contamination goes below 20% .",
    "the classification based on @xmath20 is affected by the fact that the image quality of sdss galaxies with @xmath26 starts to be degraded due to the seeing . in order to empirically compensate for the effect",

    "in the present analysis , we directly computed the number of triplets to estimate the 3pcfs @xmath45 in redshift space . in this way , we properly take account of the complicated survey volume boundary . to be more specific",
    ", we distributed @xmath46 random particles over the survey volume of a given sample of @xmath47 galaxies , following the selection function of the latter ( we used @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of all galaxies in each luminosity bin ) .",
    "then , the 3pcfs were computed from the following estimator ( szapudi , szalay 1998 ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are the number of corresponding triplets consisting of galaxies and random particles , and are normalized by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the above estimator is close to optimal , because it is constructed to provide accurate edge effect corrections .",
    "we decided to use the szapudi and szalay estimator , since we found that it converges the true 3pcf slightly more rapidly than the estimator of @xcite with the given number of random particles ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "we also estimated the redshift space 2pcf with the analogous estimator ( landy , szalay 1993 ) , and defined the normalized amplitude of 3pcfs as @xmath59 two different parameterizations of triangular shape are conventionally used in this field .",
    "one is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is assumed ( thus @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the other is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is assumed ( thus , @xmath66 , but @xmath67 may be smaller than either of the other two ; see figure [ fig : triangle ] ) .",
    "note that according to the second parameterization , one triangle is counted in three different bins in @xmath68 .",
    "although the first parameterization is more traditional in the real data analysis , we adopt the second , which is widely used in theoretical predictions .",
    "more specifically , we choose 8 equally - spaced logarithmic bins in @xmath69 and 5 equally - spaced linear bins both in @xmath70 and in @xmath71 .",
    "since the number of triplets of @xmath72 is very small ( typically @xmath73 ) , we plot the 3pcfs only for @xmath74 ( where we have more than 100 @xmath51 counts ) in what follows .",
    "also , the errors quoted below are evaluated from the 16 jack - knife re - sampling ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we ignore any possible dependence on the triangular shape for the moment , and first consider 3pcfs for equilateral triangles in detail .",
    "for this purpose , we first directly evaluate the lengths of three sides of triplets .",
    "if those sides fall in the same bin among 8 equally - spaced logarithmic bins between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we define the triplets as being equilateral triangles .",
    "figures [ fig : q_eq_cin_lum ] , [ fig : q_eq_cin_mor ] , and [ fig : q_eq_color_mor ] show @xmath10 over @xmath77 .",
    "the overall conclusion is that @xmath10 is almost scale - independent and ranges between 0.5 and 1.0 , and no systematic dependence is noticeable on the luminosity , morphology , and color .",
    "previous simulations and theoretical models ( @xcite ; matsubara , suto 1994 , @xcite , takada , jain 2003 ) indicate that @xmath12 decreases with the scale in both real and redshift spaces .",
    "observationally , @xcite suggested that @xmath10 of the 2df galaxies also decreases as scale .",
    "neither trend is clear in the results",
    ". this might be partly due to the different velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the two samples .",
    "@xcite reported that the early spirals ( sa , sab , sb ) have a significantly smaller @xmath12 than the other types , which is qualitatively consistent with the present results .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure7.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure8.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure9.eps      the statement that the values of @xmath10 are insensitive to the intrinsic properties of galaxies may sound somewhat misleading . the reduced three - point correlation amplitude is normalized by the square of the 2pcfs for the corresponding galaxies .",
    "this implies that the ( unreduced ) 3pcf depends on the galaxy properties , since 2pcfs are known to show a clear dependence on the luminosity , color , and morphology of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) . in order to further demonstrate the expected dependence in the current samples , we compute the biasing parameters estimated from the 2pcfs , @xmath78 where the index @xmath79 runs over each sample of galaxies with different morphologies , colors , and luminosities .",
    "the predictions of the mass 2pcfs in redshift space , @xmath80 , in the @xmath81 cold dark matter model are computed by properly taking account of the light - cone effect over the corresponding redshift range ( hamana et al .",
    "in doing so , we adopt the fluctuation amplitude @xmath82 and the one - dimensional peculiar pairwise velocity dispersion of 800km / s in addition to our fiducial set of cosmological parameters .    as an illustrative example , consider a simple bias model in which the galaxy density field , @xmath83 , for the @xmath79-th population of galaxies is given by @xmath84 if both @xmath85 and @xmath85 are constant and the mass density field @xmath86 , equation ( [ eq : qdef ] ) implies that @xmath87 thus , the linear bias model ( @xmath88 ) simply implies that @xmath89 is inversely proportional to @xmath90 . while this simple model may not be accurately applicable on the scales of our results , it is instructive to plot @xmath91 deduced from the 2pcf of galaxies with different luminosities and morphologies .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig:2ptbias_lum ] , [ fig:2ptbias_mor ] , and [ fig:2ptbias_col ] .",
    "a linear bias model would predict that the ratio of @xmath10 of early - types and late - types is @xmath92 , and similarly that @xmath93 .",
    "neither figure [ fig : q_eq_cin_mor ] nor [ fig : q_eq_color_mor ] , however , shows such systematic trends within our @xmath94 percent measurement accuracy . in a sense",
    ", the biasing in the 3pcfs seems to compensate for the difference of @xmath95 purely due to that in the 2pcfs .",
    "such a behavior is unlikely to be explained by any simple model inspired by the perturbative expansion , like equation ( [ eq : quadratic_bias ] ) .",
    "rather , it indeed points to a kind of regularity or universality of the clustering hierarchy behind galaxy formation and evolution processes .",
    "at least we can conclude that the galaxy biasing is more complex than the simple deterministic and linear model .",
    "more precise measurements of 3pcfs , and even higher order statistics with future sdss datasets would indeed be valuable to gain more specific insights into the empirical biasing model .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure10.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure11.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure12.eps      next consider the dependence of the 3pcfs on the triangular shape . for this purpose , we consider the volume - limited samples classified according to the colors ( @xmath96 ) because they have a greater number of galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : qtheta_color ] shows @xmath10 for all , red , and blue galaxies with @xmath97 separately .",
    "those plots indicate a weak @xmath98-dependence expected from the previous perturbation theory and n - body simulations ( e.g. , barriga , gaztaaga 2002 ; takada , jain 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath98-dependence is weaker on nonlinear scales ( @xmath99mpc ) , and becomes noticeable on larger scales .",
    "while the amplitudes of @xmath10 are much smaller than , and the color dependence seems very different from the corresponding prediction ( figure 17 of takada , jain 2003 ) , they adopt a simple halo approach , and our color selection criteria are not necessarily the same as theirs ; further careful study is needed to understand the origin of the difference ( after the present paper is accepted , @xcite submitted a theoretical paper applying the halo model to account for the 3pcfs of 2df galaxies , in particular their dependence on types and luminosity dependences , and shows the possibility that the halo model can match the observation ) .",
    "we have presented the first detailed study of the three - point correlation function of sdss galaxies in redshift space .",
    "we examined the dependence of their reduced amplitudes , @xmath10 , [ eq.([eq : qdef ] ) ] on the scale and shape of the triangles for various volumed - limited samples with different morphologies , colors , and luminosities .",
    "as for equilateral triangles , we basically confirm the hierarchical clustering relation for scales of @xmath100 . on the other hand , @xmath10 shows significant shape dependence , as expected from perturbation theory and n - body simulations , particularly at large scale , although the amplitude of @xmath10 is much smaller than the expectation .",
    "the most important finding is that although the two - point correlation functions of those galaxies show a clear dependence on their luminosity , morphology , and color , we did not find any robust dependence of @xmath10 on those properties ; the @xmath10 results when taken alone imply that galaxies are faithful tracers of the underlying mass distribution , and that their intrinsic properties are independent of the purely nonlinear gravitational evolution . at the same time , however , their two - point correlation functions strongly indicate that they are biased tracers .",
    "if we attempt to reconcile these two behaviors by using a simple linear bias model , we can not adjust it to simultaneously explain both the two - point correlation functions and the insensitivity of @xmath10 on the galaxy properties .",
    "this implies that the galaxy biasing is non - linear and fairly complex , while nonetheless displaying a remarkable constancy in reduced amplitudes .",
    "the above conclusion may appear to be inconsistent with the argument of @xcite , who concluded that the non - linearity in 2df galaxy biasing is negligible from the bispectrum analysis .",
    "we note , however , that they did not attempt to divide those galaxies into different subsamples",
    ". if we look at the results of all galaxies alone , top - panels of figures [ fig : q_eq_cin_lum ] and [ fig:2ptbias_lum ] may indicate the same conclusion as reached by @xcite .",
    "in other words , our empirical finding indicates that the non - linearity of the biasing , @xmath101 , of galaxies vanishes when the corresponding linear biasing parameter , @xmath102 , is unity .",
    "the fact that the two parameters , @xmath102 and @xmath101 , are highly correlated with each other is qualitatively consistent with some biasing model predictions including halo models or peak models ( mo et al .",
    "it is remarkable that the current galaxy survey approaches the level of discussing the validity of those models quantitatively .",
    "future sdss datasets with more area and a larger number of galaxies will be able to place stronger limits on this observation .",
    "this in turn will be useful for a detailed understanding of the nature of galaxy biasing .",
