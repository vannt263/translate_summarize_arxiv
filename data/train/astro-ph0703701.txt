    "aside from gas - phase abundances , however , it is difficult to derive physical quantities from these observations ( e.g.  temperature , density ) .",
    "the only other physical characteristic easily studied is the gas kinematics .",
    "high - resolution spectra resolve the line profiles of these transitions into ` clouds ' which trace the velocity fields in young , high @xmath1 galaxies @xcite .",

    "@xcite performed a survey of the kinematic characteristics of neutral gas in dlas and compared their observations against a variety of simple scenarios .",

    "observed asymmetries in the observed line - profiles favor rotational dynamics , yet the observed distribution of velocity widths ( @xmath18 ) has a median too large to be accommodated within standard cold dark matter cosmology . as such , @xcite presented these observations as a direct challenge to the basic picture of galaxy formation in a hierarchical universe ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in response , theorists introduced additional velocity fields to explain the observations @xcite .",
    "of particular interest was a model of merging protogalactic clumps where the observed kinematics include contributions from rotation , infall , and random motions @xcite .",
    "while the initial work established this model as a potential solution , recent evaluations using modern numerical simulations and more accurate treatments of radiative transfer have not confirmed its viability @xcite .",
    "the research on kinematic characteristics in dlas toward quasars ( hereafter qso - dlas ) , therefore , tests theories of galaxy formation and gas dynamics in the early universe .",
    "motivated by these results , we have investigated the dynamics of gas probed by the sightlines to the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "similar to quasars , the afterglows of grbs provide bright , albeit transient point - source beacons to the outer universe . with follow - up spectroscopy",
    ", one can acquire data at comparable signal - to - noise ( s / n ) and spectral resolution as quasars @xcite . in turn",
    ", one can study the velocity fields of the gas close to the observed beacon .",
    "the sightline presumably intersects gas in the star forming region encompassing the grb , the neutral ism surrounding it , and gas external to the neutral ism .    in this paper",

    "a principal goal is to characterize the velocity fields of gas observed along these unique sightlines .",

    "the latter criterion is not especially strict because we will examine the gas kinematics from equivalent width measurements which do not require high spectral resolution .",

    "therefore , this gas can not be associated with star - formation processes local to the grb ( e.g.  stellar winds , supernovae ) .",
    "the gas is either within the ism but at much larger distance than the gas that dominates the total optical depth , or it lies outside the ism altogether ( i.e.  halo gas or the ism of a companion galaxy ) .",
    "we prefer to associate the gas with the galactic halo because : ( i ) the velocities are large ( up to hundreds km  s@xmath7 ) compared to random and dynamical motions for the neutral ism of galaxies ; ( ii ) if the @xmath4  statistic tracked dynamics in the ism then a very large metallicity gradient may be required for the @xmath2  statistic to be insensitive to these motions ; ( iii ) there is high - ion absorption ( e.g.  , ; figure  [ fig : exmpl ] ) coincident with many of the low column density si@xmath89 components ; and ( iv ) the ionic ratios of some components indicate they are highly ionized @xcite .",

    "the only viable explanation for observing @xmath130 is that the gas is highly ionized .",
    "granted that gas beyond the ism dominates the @xmath4  statistic , the next issue is to examine the nature of its velocity field .",
    "this may include virialized motions , gravitational accretion @xcite , and outflows from galactic feedback @xcite .",
    "the latter two processes imply organized flows that would be revealed by the observations if we knew the systemic velocity of the galaxy . for the grb - dlas",

    "because this gas occurs within @xmath116kpc for the grb - dla , it establishes the velocity of the neutral ism .",
    "examining the line - profiles of figure  [ fig : si2 ] ( c , d ) in this light , we note that the si@xmath89 gas shows both positive and negative absorption in the case of grb - dla  050820 but predominantly negative velocities for grb - dla  051111 .",
    "therefore , one example exhibits motions reflective of a random ( i.e.  virialized ) velocity field and the other inspires an outflow interpretation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is too early to draw generic conclusions about the velocity fields of grb - dlas , but future observations akin to figure  [ fig : si2 ] will offer an unprecedented view into the nature of gas kinematics at high @xmath1 .",
    "let us now address the offset in the @xmath4  distributions between the grb - dlas and qso - dlas ( figure  [ fig : hist]b ) .",

    "the bias to smaller impact parameter will only be important if the si@xmath89 velocity fields have significant variations on kpc scales .",
    "this could occur if the majority of gas is located near star - forming regions , i.e.  the origin of the grb sightline .",
    "if the si@xmath89 gas is distributed throughout the halo ( i.e.  tens of kpc ) , then an impact parameter bias should be unimportant .",
    "meanwhile , if the velocity field has significant contribution from infall or outflow then restricting the grb - dla sightlines to originate from within the ism leads to a systematic underestimate .",
    "therefore , sightline geometry will bias the @xmath4  statistic to larger values for the grb - dla only if the velocity field has significant variations on kpc scales and is asymmetric . numerical simulations",
    "do indicate gas being accreted tends to fall in along radial orbits ( a. dekel , priv .",
    "this may imply larger @xmath4  values for sightlines originating at the center of the galaxy ( grb - dlas ) as opposed to large impact parameter ( qso - dlas ) . while differences in sightline configurations may contribute to the differences in @xmath4  between qso - dlas and grb - dlas",
    ", we contend that the observed differences in the @xmath4  distributions for grb - dlas and qso - dlas reflect actual differences in the gas kinematics of their host galaxies .",
    "a possible explanation for larger @xmath4  values in grb - dla is that their host galaxies are significantly more massive .",
    "there are two arguments against this assertion .",
    "first , the @xmath2  distributions of the qso - dlas and grb - dlas are similar ( figure  [ fig : hist]a ) . while the @xmath4  statistic may be a better tracer of the gravitational potential ( see below ) , the @xmath2  statistic should also distinguish between large differences in dark matter halo masses .",
    "second , direct imaging of grb host galaxies reveal they have low luminosity @xcite and , presumably , low mass .",
    "we consider it unlikely that the qso - dla have substantially lower luminosity ( and mass ) than that observed for the grb - dlas .",
    "the most likely interpretation for the higher @xmath4  values in grb - dlas is that the kinematics of gas contributing to the @xmath4  statistic has significant contribution from galactic - scale outflows .",
    "we are guided to this conclusion in part because the grb phenomenon is directly linked to active star formation , i.e. , grb host galaxies have systematically higher current star formation rates than qso - dla galaxies .",
    "one observes that grb host galaxies have star formation rates which are large for their luminosity @xcite .",
    "this characteristic is described as a high specific sfr and it separates grb host galaxies from the general population of high @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "therefore , a scenario where processes related to star formation stir the velocity fields traced by si@xmath89 gas may naturally account for the systematic offset in @xmath4  between qso - dlas and grb - dlas .",
    "these processes may include galactic outflows inspired by major mergers @xcite or galactic fountains driven by supernovae feedback @xcite .",
    "the latter effect may be challenged , however , by the short lifetime expected for grb progenitors . in this respect , the velocity fields of grb - dlas may more resemble the outflows of the lyman break galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we eagerly await new observations like those presented in figure  [ fig : si2 ] to further test these scenarios .      in section  [ sec : corr ] ( figure  [ fig : mtl ] )",
    ", we presented the observed correlations between the kinematic statistics ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 ) and the ism metallicity [ m / h ] .",
    "the @xmath2-[m / h ] correlation has been previously identified for qso - dla samples @xcite .",
    "although its scatter is substantial , the statistical significance is high and @xcite report a best - fit power - law of the form [ m / h]@xmath131 .",
    "these authors have interpreted the result in terms of a mass - metallicity relation , i.e.  the @xmath2  statistic traces the gravitational potential of the dla galaxy .",
    "our results on the grb - dla lend further support to this interpretation .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the @xmath2  statistic is dominated by material near the grb , i.e.  the neutral ism . although ism velocity fields are stirred by supernovae , they are generally dominated by gravitational motions ( e.g.  rotation , turbulence , accretion ) .",
    "a key aspect of the @xmath2-[m / h ] trend is its large scatter which can not be attributed to observational uncertainty .",
    "we interpret the scatter as a natural consequence of the qal experiment . if the velocity field is dominated by rotation , then a large scatter results simply from a range of impact parameters and disk inclinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", only the upper bound of the @xmath2,[m / h ] locus would describe the average rotation speed of galaxies at a given metallicity .",
    "similarly , if the velocity field results from turbulence or accretion , then @xmath2  will be sensitive to the number of clouds intersected by the sightline . in this scenario , however , one would require large variations in the number of ` clouds ' intersected by sightlines , which is not entirely supported by the observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath2-[m / h ] trend , the @xmath4,[m / h ] pairs for the qso - dlas follow an extremely tight correlation ( figure  [ fig : mtl]b ) .",
    "in fact , most of the scatter may be attributed to observational uncertainty . in several respects ,",
    "this is a stunning result .",
    "the [ m / h ] values represent the average metallicity along the entire sightline , which is dominated , of course , by the gas corresponding to the majority of the total optical depth , i.e. , the gas which defines the @xmath2  statistic . in contrast , gas which has negligible contribution to the measured metallicity can dominate the @xmath4  statistic ( figure  [ fig : si2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we have shown ( for the grb - dlas ) that [ m / h ] is set by gas local to the ism of the galaxy whereas the @xmath4  statistic has significant contribution from gas external to the ism .",

    "the first point to stress is that we derive a similar power - law as observed for the @xmath2,[m / h ] pairs in qso - dlas ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that the kinematic - metallicity trends have the same physical origin .",
    "one may gain insight by comparing our trend with the velocity - metallicity correlations observed for other galactic populations .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "let us now consider arguments for and against each interpretation .",

    "second , the large scatter in the @xmath2-[m / h ] trend can be explained by variations in impact parameter and inclination through the dla galaxies .",

    "the latter point is supported by the observations ( e.g.  figure  [ fig : exmpl ] ) .",
    "fourth , the  1526 profiles of at least some grb - dlas show both negative and positive velocities relative to the systemic ( figure  [ fig : si2 ] ) .",
    "this is expected for gas that traces a virialized ( random ) velocity field ( see also robertson & chen , in prep . ) .",
    "finally , @xcite have noted that the only dlas that have been successfully imaged at @xmath141 also have high metallicity , suggesting stellar mass may correlate with enrichment .",
    "there are two counterarguments to interpreting the @xmath2  and @xmath4statistics as tracers of the gravitational potential of individual dark matter halos .",
    "first , it is may be unrealistic to explain velocity widths that exceed several hundred km  s@xmath7  in terms of a single galactic potential . at very large @xmath2  or @xmath4  values",
    ", therefore , we expect that additional velocity fields contribute .",
    "these could include galactic - scale outflows but also the peculiar motions of multiple galaxies along the sightline ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "second , @xcite have reported an anti - correlation between equivalent width ( in detail we find @xmath142 ) . ] and the cluster - length of these absorbers ( a subset include dlas * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with large , red galaxies ( lrgs ) .",
    "these authors have interpreted this result in terms of a wind scenario : systems exhibiting larger equivalent widths occur in less massive , star - bursting galaxies .",
    "we note , however , several caveats to their interpretation : ( i ) the absorbers have @xmath124 and may have very different characteristics ( star - formation rates , metallicity , gas content ) than the @xmath14 qso - dlas that are plotted in figure  [ fig : mtl ] ; ( ii ) @xcite find the integrated light of galaxies corresponding to absorbers is brighter for larger equivalent width systems suggesting larger masses .    now consider the evidence in favor of interpreting the @xmath4statistic ( and perhaps @xmath2 ) as galactic - scale outflows .",
    "first , as noted above , the trend of decreasing correlation - length with increasing equivalent width offers at least qualitative evidence for a wind scenario @xcite .",
    "second , the kinematics of some strong absorbers are consistent with that expected for symmetric outflows @xcite .",
    "third , if star formation drives galactic - scale outflows , then one may expect a correlation between metallicity and @xmath4",

    "third , we find the lyman break galaxy ms  1512-cb58  @xcite lies directly on the @xmath4-[m / h ] trend of the qso - dlas ( black diamond in figure  [ fig : mtl]b ) .",
    "given that the lbg gas kinematics are dominated by outflows @xcite , the correspondence between the lbg data and the qso - dla trend is at least suggestive that outflows may play a role in shaping the observed correlation .",
    "the comparison with the qso - dlas may not be appropriate , however , because the lbg sightline is restricted to originate at the central , star - forming region of the galaxy .",
    "this implies a special impact parameter and one that presumably probes only half of the total velocity field . in these respects ,",
    "a comparison with the grb - dlas is more appropriate and the correspondence with the qso - dla trend may be simple coincidence .",
    "there are several arguments against interpreting the @xmath4  measurements as galactic - scale outflows .",
    "first , the similarity in the @xmath4  and @xmath2-[m / h ] trends would require one to interpret both statistics in terms of outflows ( or invoke coincidence ) . in turn , one would have to argue that these winds have gas with large neutral fractions @xcite and significant cross - section to gas with @xmath144 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "second , we believe a galactic - scale outflow scenario would be severely challenged to reproduce the tight correlation observed for @xmath4  and metallicity .",
    "assuming outflows are generally collimated , the @xmath4  statistic should exhibit a wide range of values for a given wind speed as a function of the sightline configuration ( i.e.  impact parameter and inclination ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath4  value is given by the internal dynamics of the wind ( i.e.  its turbulence ) because it is a relative measure independent of the systemic velocity .",
    "it is not obvious that this quantity could be tightly correlated with metallicity .",
    "third , there are at least some grb - dlas where the @xmath4  velocity field is not strictly consistent with outflows ( figure  [ fig : si2 ] ) .",
    "fourth , mass - metallicity relations have been identified for numerous galaxy populations at a range of redshifts @xcite",
    ". it would be very remarkable for the qso - dlas to exhibit a tight velocity - metallicity trend that was unrelated to a mass - metallicity correlation .",
    "fifth , we question a scenario which requires galactic - scale outflows in all galaxies tuned to give both low and large @xmath4  values with such small scatter .",
    "sixth , comparisons of absorption line profiles with emission - line kinematics are inconsistent with a wind scenario and support dynamical motions @xcite . finally ,",
    "while observers are quick to invoke outflows to explain extreme velocity fields , we question whether outflows can reasonably explain widths approaching and in excess of 1000 km  s@xmath7 .    on balance , we currently favor the interpretation of the velocity fields in qso - dlas as being dominated by gravitational motions , at least for @xmath145  and @xmath119 . at large @xmath4  and large @xmath2 ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect that additional velocity fields contribute .",
    "indeed , an inspection of figure  [ fig : mtl]b reveals that the qso - dla galaxies with largest departure from the [ m / h]-@xmath4  relation occur at large @xmath4  values .",
    "these few qso - dlas have especially large @xmath4  for their observed metallicity and/or low metallicity for the observed @xmath4  value .",
    "we suspect that the former inference is the correct interpretation and that these systems have contributions to the @xmath4  statistic beyond the halo gas dynamics .",
    "these qso - dlas are the most viable candidates for sightlines penetrating galactic - scale outflows .",
    "this interpretation could also explain the frequency of grb - dlas that lie off the qso - dla trend . as noted in the previous section , grb - dlas have especially large specific star formation rates .",
    "therefore , grb may flag galaxies at a time when they are most likely to drive galactic - scale outflows .",
    "given the identification of grb with massive , short - lived stars , there may not be sufficient time to drive these winds with supernovae feedback .",
    "instead , one may need to consider merger - driven , galactic outflows ."
