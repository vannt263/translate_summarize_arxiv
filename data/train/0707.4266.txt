    "we here deal with the one - subtracted integral dispersion relations ( idr ) used in high energy scattering , as introduced originally to study the properties of the complex functions that represent the scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "these relations are derived from general principles of causality , analyticity and crossing , and provide connections between the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes , helping in the disentanglement of the expressions that represent the observable probabilities .",
    "the relations are written for amplitudes that have specific behavior under the operation of crossing symmetry , that connects @xmath1 and @xmath2 reaction channels ( @xmath3 is the antiparticle of @xmath4 ) .",
    "these dispersion relations are derived using the cauchy theorem , having the form of infinite integrations over the energy of the scattering process .",
    "the applications in phenomenology are restricted because experimental information is limited to finite energy values . in spite of this limitation ,",
    "applications of idr to the analysis of hadronic scattering were numerous in the years that followed the original work .",
    "the conversion of integrations over infinite energy intervals into infinite series of derivatives of the amplitudes in a single energy leads to the so called derivative dispersion relations ( ddr ) .",
    "the program has run through a long and rather slow progress , which started in 1969 @xcite , when , in a specific dynamical model in regge theory framework , gribov and migdal wrote a relation in which real and imaginary amplitudes are connected by a single derivative with respect to the logarithm of the energy .",
    "more general relations of local form were written for the even and odd ( under crossing ) amplitudes @xcite , through algebraic transformations and series expansions that required appropriate analytical properties of the imaginary amplitude . at about the same time , similar derivative dispersion relations were written @xcite and applied to the analysis of hadronic scattering within the regge dynamics approach .",
    "the expressions of these ddr are formed by infinite series of derivatives of increasing order , with the form of a symbolic tangent operator in the derivatives with respect to the logarithm of the energy , as written below in eqs .",
    "( [ ddrplus_new ] , [ ddrminus_new ] ) .",
    "the need of mathematical convergence of the series , which depends on the analytic form of the imaginary amplitudes , has restricted the applicability and credibility of the method , and soon it was analysed in both aspects of mathematical validity and physical usefulness .",
    "examples of physical interest were given @xcite for which the series are divergent , as in the presence of resonance poles in general , and in particular for a breit - wigner amplitude .",
    "convergence conditions were discussed by heidrich and kazes @xcite who proved that the representation of the amplitude as a series in the logarithm of the energy must have an infinite convergence radius ; thus the amplitude must be an entire function of the energy logarithm .",
    "again it was here observed that in the presence of singularities the ddr representation is not justified .",
    "the use of ddr with a regge representation of the amplitudes , consisting only of log , log - squared and power terms of the energy , without resonance poles , first introduced by kang and nicolescu @xcite , was discussed by bujak and dumbrajs @xcite .",
    "the authors warn for the spurious singular behavior of the tangent series for specific values of the power parameters , which is a peculiar feature of the series summation in the original form of ddr obtained in the low energy approximation .",
    "concerns with the mathematical validity of the ddr lead fischer and kol , in a series of papers @xcite , to the establishment of conditions under which the series of derivatives have meaning , converging at a point or in an energy range .",
    "the ddr technique was considered of practical usefulness , in spite of the limitations on the form of functions to which it could be applied , and it was actually used in phenomenological investigations in pp and p@xmath5 scattering .",
    "limitations in this use of ddr were due to the lack of knowledge of the importance of the approximations involved in their derivation , of which the so called high energy approximation is the most important , and also the role of a free parameter @xmath6 that appeared in the algebraic manipulation leading from idr to ddr @xcite .",
    "use of the integration constant @xmath7 that appears in the one - subtracted idr , and sometimes of the value of the quantity @xmath6 , as free parameters , filled gaps between phenomenological parameterizations and data , hiding some of the difficulties .",
    "a comprehensive account of the progress of ddr , with clear description of limitations and successes of the method in its applications to hadronic ( pp and p@xmath5 ) scattering , is found in @xcite . as far as the applications to hadronic scattering",
    "are concerned , practical uses of ddr only consider a few forms of energy dependence of the imaginary amplitude that are required to represent the data @xcite .",
    "a main step in the progress came with the extension of the ddr to the low energy region , up to the threshold @xcite , with a derivation free of the high energy approximation , opening the way to the true mathematical connection between integral and local representations of scattering amplitudes .",
    "the expressions given for the ddr are double infinite series , with rather complicated form , but really presenting no practical difficulty for their numerical summation , as the series have quickly decreasing terms .",
    "the only remaining difficulty may rest in the characterization of convergence criteria for double series .",
    "applications to the description of pp and p@xmath5 data have been very successful , showing perfect superposition of evaluations of the real amplitudes through idr and the full exact ddr .    in the present paper we deal with the establishment of mathematical relations through which local expressions represent infinite dispersion integrals exactly .",
    "we are not concerned here with phenomenological fittings or choice of parameters so that we drop the additive constant @xmath7 and put the parameter @xmath8 . using sum rules of the incomplete gamma functions which have been derived before @xcite , we are able to reduce the double series to single summations , where convergence properties are of elementary knowledge .",
    "the connections thus established between principal value integrals and series summations are true mathematical identities , and even lead to the establishment of some new formulae of mathematical interest .",
    "our results are explicitly presented for all functions used in hadronic scattering phenomenology @xcite .",
    "since the connections between integral and local dispersion relations are linear , we can study simple forms separately , without concern on their superposition to construct physical amplitudes . for imaginary amplitudes of the form of functions of the energy logarithms , built as sums of products of the type @xmath9^k \\times ( e / m)^\\lambda$ ]",
    ", it seems that no restriction or approximation needs to be introduced to represent by single series the integral dispersion relations of scattering theory .",
    "the convergence criteria are the same as the conditions for validity of the original integral forms .",
    "the standard forms of ddr , called sddr , viciously affected by the high energy approximation , often have simple expressions in terms of elementary functions , but are frequently inaccurate as representations of the original idr that they intend to substitute .",
    "they even create spurious singular behavior where the principal value integrals are regular .",
    "our investigation of the asymptotic behavior of the full ddr shows also that the sddr may even be incomplete as a high energy limit approximation .",
    "our work leads to the conclusion that the derivation of vila and menon @xcite is correct , and shows that the separation between standard sddr and correction terms is unnecessary and misleading , and from now on should be considered only for historical reference .",
    "the exact mathematical correspondence between integral and local dispersion relations opens new lines of investigation , not only in hadronic scattering , but also in other areas of physics where the use of dispersion techniques is important .    in the present work we take",
    "as given the description of the historical facts and critical analysis about derivative dispersion relations @xcite , and start from the recent results of vila and menon @xcite that obtained expressions for ddr valid for the whole energy interval above the physical threshold .",
    "the paper develops the analytical treatment of cases of imaginary amplitudes of forms @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an integer . first considering imaginary amplitudes @xmath12 and @xmath13 of form @xmath14 , where series of derivatives become series of usual functions , we recall a mathematical relation @xcite that expresses in closed form the sums over the incomplete @xmath0 functions that appear in the double series .",
    "the resulting single series are studied in detail .",
    "as illustration of the analytical results , numerical comparison of maximum machine accuracy between the principal value integral and the ddr representation is successfully performed .",
    "special discussion is made of the behavior of ddr in the cases @xmath11 = 0 , 1 , 2 in the proximity of values of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) where spurious singularities appear in the expressions of sddr . through numerical tables",
    "we show how the correction terms of the full ddr introduce singularities of opposite sign that exactly compensate the sddr disease , leading to results that regularize the full ddr and are confirmed by the original idr .",
    "we are here concerned with the study of problems in the strong interaction of fundamental particles , such as proton - proton ( pp ) and proton - antiproton ( p@xmath5 ) collisions at high energies .",
    "all masses being equal , these are processes of the kind @xmath17 .",
    "protons have antiprotons as their antiparticles , and the pp and p@xmath5 channels are connected by the operation of crossing symmetry , leading to the definition of combined amplitudes , which are even ( subscript + ) or odd ( subscript @xmath18 ) under such operation .",
    "when dispersion relations are constructed , care must be taken of the behavior at large distances in the complex plane , in order to find the proper function for which the relations are valid .",
    "the factors introduced as needed for convergence at infinity appear in the form of subtractions , which introduce external constants . in the case of high energy scattering here",
    "considered , one subtraction is needed , and the integral dispersion relations ( idr ) are written @xcite @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively for the amplitudes which are even and odd under crossing .",
    "@xmath7 is the subtraction constant of the one - subtracted dispersion relation , @xmath21 is the proton mass , @xmath22 is the total energy of the incident particle in the laboratory system , and @xmath23 is the momentum tranfer in the elastic collision ( @xmath23 will be written as equal to zero from now on ) .",
    "the pp and p@xmath5 channels are governed by the combinations @xmath24    this is a well defined theoretical framework , but it has the practical difficulty that it requires the knowledge of imaginary amplitude in the whole energy interval , from threshold @xmath21 to infinity , for the calculation of the real part .",
    "extrapolations to far away energies go beyond safe phenomenological or model - building grounds .",
    "this difficulty lead to the development of local relations , in which the real amplitude at a given energy is expressed in terms of derivatives of the imaginary part at the same energy , or in a nearby range .    with the notation and kinematics used in eqs .",
    "( [ inteven ] ) and ( [ intodd ] ) , these ddr introduced for the high energy conditions are written @xmath25   \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath26    these forms are derived for high energies ( @xmath27 goes to zero or @xmath28 goes to infinity ) .",
    "they are the traditional ddr , often applied in the description of pp and and p@xmath5 cross sections @xcite , called _ standard derivative dispersion relations _ , sddr , by vila and menon @xcite , to distinguish them from extended forms eddr that aim at covering also the low energy region , and which are discussed in the present work .",
    "the constant @xmath7 , which is important in phenomenology , would be transferred without any action from eq .",
    "( [ inteven ] ) to the final exact formulae that we write , and will be dropped from now on .",
    "the introduction of ddr raised concerns about its mathematical validity , due to the infinite series of operator derivatives of increasing order , symbolically represented by the tangent operator .    in practice , since we do not know the exact analytical forms of the theoretical amplitudes , in the applications of ddr at high energies one deals with phenomenological representations , obtained from fitting or from models , in terms of simple functions of @xmath22 and @xmath29 , used in the description of pp and p@xmath5 at high energies .",
    "for these cases , the questions of convergence and mathematical validity can be treated directly , and may even become trivial , with explicit sums of the resulting series .",
    "actually , in asymptotic limits the whole tangent series can eventually be reduced to its first term .",
    "however , in principle dignified relations should be written and valid for the exact amplitudes , whatever be their analytical forms .",
    "eichmann and dronkers @xcite have shown that the ddr are valid only for certain classes of entire functions of @xmath30 . in a series of papers , kol and",
    "fischer @xcite established theorems fixing the conditions for the validity of the representations of amplitudes in terms of series of derivatives .",
    "the main results are expressed as follows .",
    "* theorem :* let @xmath31 .",
    "the series @xmath32\\ , f(x)\\ ] ] converges at a point @xmath33 in @xmath34 if and only if the series @xmath35 is convergent .",
    "besides , another theorem implies that the convergence in an energy interval requires that @xmath36 be an entire function of complex @xmath33 and that the series of positive orders in derivatives @xmath37 also converges .",
    "these important theorems allow the examination of the convergence of the tangent series that appear in the applications of ddr to high energy scattering , where simple functions like @xmath33 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , ... appear . here",
    "@xmath33 is written in the place of @xmath30 .",
    "the high energy approximations restrict the use of ddr in regions of a few gev where models and different descriptions of pp and p@xmath5 scattering are tested and compared .",
    "vila and menon @xcite presented a derivation of ddr avoiding the high energy approximations , and showed results representing well the exact idr , even close to the threshold ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the results , presented in the form of double infinite sums , have their conditions of convergence difficult to prove .",
    "in this section we test these results in some cases of interest .",
    "the results of vila and menon are presented in the following form , called eddr ( extended derivative dispersion relations ) . for even parity",
    "they write @xmath42 where the correction term @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 for the odd relation they obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 equations ( [ eq : eddre ] ) and ( [ eq : eddro ] ) are meant to be valid , for appropriate functional forms of the imaginary amplitude , for any energy above the physical threshold @xmath47 . as a previous verification , before making use of our sum rules for the @xmath0 functions , we present in this section practical examples comparing , in accurate numerical terms , the original idr ( supposed to be exact ) with the improved eddr .",
    "we take as working examples the forms @xmath14 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and choose a very low energy @xmath48 where the corrections are expected to be large .",
    "we then evaluate the contribution of each term to the real amplitude , through idr and through sddr and eddr , to check for differences .    to exemplify the use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eddre ] ) and ( [ eq : eddro ] ) in calculations in local form of the integral dispersion relations in eqs .",

    "( [ eq : eddre ] ) and ( [ eq : eddro ] ) respectively . with these forms for the imaginary amplitudes the tangent series of derivatives in sddr",

    "the cauchy principal value integrations were made with the mathematica 6.0 program .",
    "the case @xmath53 is not applicable to the odd case , as the integral in idr diverges , and also the sddr gives the infinite value @xmath54 .",
