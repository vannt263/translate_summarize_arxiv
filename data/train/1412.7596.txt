    "symbiotic stars are long - period binary systems consisting of two stars representing a late stage in stellar evolution : the cool primary and hot and luminous secondary ( typically white dwarf albeit a neutron star has been found in a few cases ) surrounded by an ionized nebula . based on their near - infrared ( ir ) characteristics ,",
    "symbiotic stars are divided into two main classes : s - type with normal red giant ( @xmath180percent ) , and d - type with mira variable embedded in an optically thick dust shell ( @xmath120percent ) . a strong interaction between components",
    "is driven by mass loss from the cool donor that is partly accreted from the wind and@xmath2or via roche lobe overflow ( @xcite ) on to the hot companion . in the past ,",
    "when the present compact object underwent its red giant stage , mass had to be transferred in the opposite direction from this star to the star that is currently a red giant .",
    "that mass transfer episode should have left traces in the chemical composition of the red giant observed today . indeed such chemical pollution has been detected in some red giant  white dwarf binary systems @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the atmospheric chemical composition of symbiotic giants is of special significance as it can be used to track the mass exchange history as well as their population origin .",
    "however , at the moment reliable measurements of photospheric compositions exist for only 10 symbiotic systems with late - type ( m ) giants and about a dozen ` yellow ' , i.e. g or k giant , symbiotic systems .",
    "prior to the current series of papers only four m giants in s - type symbiotic systems had been analysed in the literature : v2116oph @xcite , tcrb , rsoph @xcite , and chcyg @xcite .",
    "all of them had solar or nearly solar metallicities .",
    "the rarer symbiotic stars containing k - type giants are metal poor with s - process elements overabundant ( @xcite ; @xcite ) whereas those with g - type giants have solar metallicity and s - process enhancement ( @xcite ) .    [",
