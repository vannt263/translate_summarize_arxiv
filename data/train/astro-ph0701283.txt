    "since the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al .  2004 ) became operational in december 2003 , very important progress has been made in understanding the nature and properties of infrared ( ir ) galaxies .",
    "this progress has been revolutionary , in particular , for the study of galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath12 ) , to which all of the previous ir facilities operating in the wavelength range @xmath13 had basically no access .",
    "previous missions as the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ and the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ allowed to produce multiple studies of mid- and far - ir galaxies , but they were restricted to lower redshifts ( @xmath14 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] ) due to their sensitivity limits . until the launch of _ spitzer _ , our vision of the high - redshift ir universe was biased to the relatively small number of galaxies detected in sub - millimetre and millimetre surveys ( e.g. scott et al .  2002 ; webb et al .  2003 ; greve et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the sensitivity achieved by the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) at @xmath3is enabling for the first time to conduct systematic studies of ir galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "several recent works have shown that , in contrast to what happens in the local universe , the ir extragalactic light is increasingly dominated by luminous and ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( lirg and ulirg , respectively ) with increasing redshift ( e.g. le floch et al .",
    "2004 ; lonsdale et al .  2004",
    "; yan et al . 2004 ; le floch et al .  2005 ; caputi et al .",
    "2006a , b ) .",
    "these lirg and ulirg constitute an important fraction of the most massive galaxies present at @xmath15 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] ( caputi et al .",
    "2006b ) .    in a minor but non - negligible fraction of high - redshift ir galaxies",
    ", the ir emission is produced by the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the exact proportion of agn - dominated ir galaxies is actually not known , and the determination of such ratio is one of the main problems of ir astronomy .",
    "a definitive agn / star - forming galaxy separation requires the knowledge of the far - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible for most of high-@xmath16 galaxies , as their far - ir emission is usually below the confusion limits at far - ir wavelengths ( dole et al .",
    "this separation is also complicated by the existence of mixed systems , where both star - formation and agn activity significantly contribute to the ir emission ( e.g. lutz et al .",
    "2005 ; yan et al .",
    "2005 ; le floch et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , the agn discrimination is essential to disentangle how much of the ir energy density is associated with star - formation .",
    "the study of a galaxy luminosity function at different redshifts allows to understand the composition of the extragalactic background as a function of look - back time .",
    "the analysis of the changes of the lf with redshift is one of the most direct methods to explore the evolution of a galaxy population .",
    "the first studies of the ir - galaxy lf in the local universe and at low ( @xmath14 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] ) redshifts have been based on _ iras _ and _ iso _ data ( e.g. saunders et al .",

    "; takeuchi et al . 2006 ) . using the most recent _",
    "spitzer_/mips data , le floch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) analysed in detail the evolution of the ir lf from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "they found a positive evolution both in luminosity and density between these two redshifts , implying that ir galaxies were more numerous and the ir output was dominated by brighter galaxies at @xmath19 than at @xmath20 .",
    "the ir galaxy lf at higher redshifts have been explored by other authors ( prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2005 ; babbedge et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "rest - frame @xmath0luminosities , in particular , are of main relevance for star - forming galaxies as they contain information on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission .",
    "pah molecules characterise star - forming regions ( dsert , boulanger & puget 1990 ) and the associated emission lines dominate the sed of star - forming galaxies between wavelengths @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with a main bump located around @xmath0 .",
    "rest - frame @xmath0luminosities have been confirmed to be good indicators of knots of star formation ( roussel et al .",
    "2001 ; frster - schreiber et al .",
    "2004 ; calzetti et al .",
    "2005 ) and of the overall star - formation activity of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. wu et al .",
    "2005 ) , except in low - luminosity galaxies with intense ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation fields ( galliano et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in this work",
    "we compute the rest - frame @xmath0lf at redshifts @xmath1 and @xmath23 , using @xmath3-selected galaxies in the two fields of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) . at @xmath8 , where the fraction of agn appears to be significant",
    ", we analyse separately the lf for star - forming galaxies and for the total ir - galaxy population .",
    "the two goods fields cover a smaller area than those analysed by some other previous studies of the ir lf .",
    "however , they benefit from uniquely deep homogeneous photometric datasets , ranging from the x - rays to radio wavelengths , as well as an important spectroscopic coverage . as we explain in section [ sec_sample ] , this makes possible an almost complete identification of @xmath3galaxies down to faint fluxes and the derivation of accurate redshift determinations ( cf . also caputi et al .",
    "2006a , c ) .",
    "these two characteristics are essential for a proper computation of the lf at high redshifts , without any conclusion relying either on completeness or selection - function corrections .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec_sample ] , we describe in detail the selection of our @xmath3-galaxy samples at redshifts @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in section [ sec_agnsep ] , we explain how we perform the separation between star - forming galaxies and agn within our sample .",
    "we compute the rest - frame @xmath0lf at @xmath1 in section [ sec_lf8z1 ] and analyse its evolution from @xmath5 . in section [ sec_lf8 ] , we present the rest - frame @xmath0lf at @xmath8 and extend the analysis of the evolution up to this high redshift .",
    "later , in section [ sec_lfbol ] , we use a new empirical calibration based on _ spitzer _ galaxies to obtain the bolometric ir lf at different redshifts .",
    "finally , in sections [ sec_disc ] and [ sec_conc ] , respectively , we discuss our results and present some concluding remarks .",
    "we adopt throughout a cosmology with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the goods fields , namely the goods / chandra deep field south ( goods / cdfs ) and goods / hubble deep field north ( goods / hdfn ) , have been observed by _",
    "spitzer _ as one of the cycle-1 legacy science programs ( p.i .",
    "mark dickinson ) . extended areas of the cdfs and hdfn have also been observed as part of the _ spitzer _ irac and mips guaranteed time observers ( gto ) programs ( p.i .",
    "giovanni fazio and george rieke , respectively ) .",
    "goods / irac maps at 3.6 to @xmath0and mips maps at @xmath3are now publicly available .",
    "the corresponding goods public @xmath3catalogues have been constructed using prior positional information from the irac 3.6 and @xmath29 images and by an additional blind extraction of @xmath3sources .",
    "the resulting @xmath3catalogues are basically reliable and complete for galaxies with fluxes down to @xmath30 ( chary et al .",

    "although , in principle , fainter sources can be detected in the deeper goods images , we decide to only use the conservative goods @xmath33 galaxy catalogues for the selection of our @xmath3-galaxy samples at @xmath18 and @xmath8 . in this way , our computed lf are virtually not affected by incompleteness corrections ( cf . sections [ sec_lf8z1 ] and [ sec_lf8 ] ) .      in the goods / cdfs , we restrict our analysis to the 131 arcmin@xmath4 which have deep @xmath34 and @xmath35-band coverage by the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) on the ` antu ' very large telescope ( antu - vlt ) ( goods / eis v1.0 release ; vandame et al . , in preparation ) .",

    ", we considered that the counterpart to the @xmath3source was the @xmath35 galaxy closest to the @xmath3source centroid .",
    "the @xmath36 mag catalogue allows us to identify 515 @xmath3galaxies within the 131 arcmin@xmath4 area , i.e. @xmath39 of the @xmath3galaxies with @xmath33 in this field .",
    "caputi et al .",
    "( 2006c ) measured multiwavelength photometry for all their @xmath36 mag galaxies .",
    "they ran sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in ` double - image mode ' to perform aperture photometry on the goods / eis v1.0 @xmath34-band images , centred at the position of the @xmath35-band extracted sources .",
    "they also looked for counterparts of the @xmath36 mag sources in the public goods advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) catalogues , which provided photometry in the @xmath40 and @xmath16 bands .",
    "the stellarity parameter measured on the @xmath16-band images allowed them to separate out galactic stars . finally , they ran sextractor on the spitzer / irac @xmath41 and @xmath42 images to identify the @xmath36 mag galaxies and measured aperture photometry at these longer wavelengths .",
    "we refer the reader to caputi et al .",
    "( 2006c ) for additional details about the photometric measurements and applied aperture corrections .",
    "caputi et al .  ( 2006c ) obtained an estimated redshift for each one of their galaxies modelling their stellar sed from the b through the @xmath42 bands .",
    "they used the public code hyperz ( bolzonella , miralles & pell , 2000 ) with the gissel98 template library ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) and the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reddening law to account for internal dust extinction .",
    "the hyperz redshift estimates have been replaced by combo17 photometric redshifts ( wolf et al .",

    "the sed fitting has been constrained to the combo17 redshifts .",
    "the cross - correlation of the goods / cdfs @xmath3catalogue with the caputi et al .",
    "( 2006c ) @xmath36 mag catalogue directly gives us estimated redshifts and best - fitting sed models for all the identified @xmath3galaxies .      in the goods / hdfn",
    ", we followed a similar strategy for the analysis of sources as in the goods / cdfs .",
    "however , unfortunately , we only have access to deep @xmath35-band data for a part of this field ( reddy et al .  2006b ) .",
    "thus , we used the spitzer / irac @xmath45 maps to identify the @xmath3galaxies .",
    "we analysed in this case the entire goods / hdfn region , i.e. the 160 arcmin@xmath4 with deep goods / hst - acs coverage .",
    "we ran sextractor on the irac @xmath41 and @xmath42 images .",
    "we constructed a catalogue of @xmath45 sources , accepting only those objects also identified in the @xmath42 band . to encompass the technique applied by caputi et al .",
    "( 2006c ) on the irac maps of the goods / cdfs , we measured photometry in circular apertures of 2.83@xmath37-diameter and applied aperture corrections of 0.50 and 0.55 mag to the @xmath41 and @xmath42 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "we then used this @xmath45 catalogue to identify the @xmath3sources in the goods / hdfn , using a matching radius of 2@xmath37 .",
    "this allows us to identify 856 @xmath3galaxies in the 160 arcmin@xmath4 of the goods / hdfn , i.e. @xmath46 of the @xmath3galaxies with @xmath47 in this field .",
    "the identification completeness achieved for @xmath3galaxies in this field using @xmath45 sources is similar to the identification completeness obtained for @xmath3galaxies in the goods / cdfs using @xmath35-band sources .",
    "this indicates that the two identification methods are basically equivalent . in any case , the irac 3.6 and @xmath42 data are incorporated in the sed modelling of all the sources in the two fields .",
    "we followed up in the optical bands those irac @xmath45 objects which were counterparts to @xmath47 sources .",
    "once more , we used the public goods acs catalogues to obtain aperture photometry in the @xmath40 and @xmath16 bands .",
    "in addition , we looked for counterparts of the @xmath45 sources in the u and hk-band images of the goods / hdfn ( capak et al .",
    "although these images are relatively shallower than the other optical / near - ir data available for this field , we decided to include these data to improve the sed coverage .",
    "finally , we incorporated the deep @xmath34 and @xmath35-band data from reddy et al .",
    "( 2006b ) for those galaxies lying in the region where these data were available ( @xmath48 of the analysed area ) .",
    "we used the multiwavelength data from the u to the @xmath42 bands to model the sed and obtain photometric redshifts for all of our @xmath3galaxies in the goods / hdfn using hyperz , in an analogous way to that in caputi et al .",
    "( 2006c ) . as in the latter , we applied a set of criteria to control the hyperz output : 1 ) the photometric redshifts for galaxies detected in the shallow u - band catalogues were constrained to a maximum value @xmath49 , as bright u - band sources are unlikely to be beyond these redshifts ; 2 ) analagously , the estimated redshifts of galaxies not - detected in the u - band but detected in the b - band were constrained to a maximum value @xmath50 ; 3 ) for the goods / hdfn catalogue , we found that hyperz produced an overdensity of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath51 .",
    "comparison with spectroscopic redshifts ( see below ) suggested that this overdensity was an artefact of hyperz applied to our sample .",
    "thus , to test these possible spurious redshifts , we double - checked the fitting of all the galaxies with hyperz redshift @xmath51 using the pgase library ( le borgne & rocca - volmerange 2002 ) .",
    "we kept the hyperz solution for those sources confirmed by pgase as belonging to the 1.5 - 1.7 redshift range .",
    "for all the remaining @xmath51 galaxies , we replaced the photometric redshift by the pgase estimate .",
    "this strategy improved the agreement with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the percentage of galaxies with pgase redshifts in our final @xmath3catalogue for the goods / hdfn is 5% .",
    "our final @xmath3catalogue contains 1371 @xmath3sources with @xmath47 over a total area of 291 arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "we identified only 22 out of 1371 sources as galactic stars .",
    "all the remaining sources are galaxies .",
    "our aim is to separate two sub - samples of galaxies from this final catalogue : 1 ) the @xmath3galaxies with redshifts @xmath24 for the computation of the ir lf at @xmath1 ; 2 ) the @xmath3galaxies with redshifts @xmath25 for the computation of the ir lf at @xmath8 .",
    "we performed a final step before separating the two definitive sub - samples of @xmath3galaxies used in this work .",
    "in addition to the wealth of photometric data , both goods fields benefit from an important amount of spectroscopic data , most of which are publicly available ( cohen et al .  1996 ; le fvre et al .  2004 ; wirth et al .  2004 ; vanzella et al .",

    "some additional redshifts in the goods / cdfs have been kindly made available to us by franois hammer and hctor flores .",
    "we compiled these data and found that more than @xmath52 of our @xmath3galaxies in the combined fields had spectroscopic redshifts .",

    "we observe a good agreement between photometric estimates and real redshifts .",

    ", we select those @xmath3galaxies lying at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath24 sample is composed of 227 galaxies with @xmath47 and a median redshift @xmath55 .",
    "we use this sample to compute the ir lf at @xmath1 .",
    "more than 60% of these galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts @xmath56 .",
    "the quality of photometric redshifts is similar as that for the total sample : the median of relative errors @xmath53 is -0.01 and the dispersion is @xmath54 . in the computation of the ir",
    "lf at @xmath1 , we consider that these errors only affect those galaxies with photometric redshifts ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "our @xmath25 sample contains 161 @xmath3galaxies with @xmath47 .",
    "this is the sample we use to compute the ir lf at redshift @xmath8 .",
    "the median redshifts of these 161 galaxies is @xmath58 .",
    "although for practicity we refer to these galaxies as the @xmath8 sample , all the calculations made in sections [ sec_lf8 ] and [ sec_lfbol ] take into account the actual median redshift value .",
    "more than 15% of the galaxies selected with @xmath25 have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the quality of photometric redshifts for the @xmath8 sample can also be assessed from figure [ fig_zphzsp ] .",
    "we see that the agreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is still very reasonable for this high - redshift sample .",
    "the distribution of relative errors @xmath53 has a median -0.01 and a dispersion @xmath59 .",
    "this statistics has been computed based on all sources ( i.e. agn included ; see below ) .",
    "this suggests that the sed templates we use to derive photometric redshifts are suitable for all our sample .",
    "the photometric redshift error bars affect the majority of galaxies in our @xmath8 sample and are taken into account in the computation of the corresponding lf , as we explain in section [ sec_lf8 ] .",
    "we note that the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are representative of our entire @xmath3sample in each of the considered redshift bins ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the two panels in figure [ fig_l8histo ] show the rest - frame @xmath0luminosities of all of our galaxies ( empty histograms ) and those of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts ( shaded histograms ) , at these different redshifts .",
    "details on the calculation of @xmath0luminosities are given in section [ sec_lf8z1 ] . from figure [ fig_l8histo ]",
    ", we can see that galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts basically span the whole range of ir luminosities considered in this work .",
    "thus , the errors derived from the comparison of photometric and spectroscopic redshifts are applicable to the entire ir lf .",
    "in this work , we would like to compare the ir lf for star - forming galaxies only with the total ir lf . to do this",
    ", we need to identify the active galaxies present in our sample .",
    "one of the most efficient ways of identifying agn is through their x - ray emission .",
    "the goods fields have deep x - ray coverage obtained with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ : the 1ms maps for the cdfs ( giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) and the 2ms maps for the hdfn ( alexander et al .",
    "we used the corresponding public x - ray catalogues to identify the agn within our sample .",
    "however , given the depth of these catalogues ( especially that of the hdfn ) , x - ray sources include not only quasars and agn but also powerful starburts which also emit in x - rays .",
    "to separate the two classes of x - ray sources , an optical versus x - ray flux diagram can be used .",
    "figure [ fig_rvsx ] shows the @xmath60-band magnitude versus the soft x - ray flux of the x - ray - detected galaxies in our @xmath3sample in the hdfn .",
    "the @xmath60-band magnitudes of our galaxies have been interpolated using the @xmath61 and @xmath62 magnitudes .",
    "this plot is similar to that presented in alexander et al .",
    "the dashed line shows the empirical separation between normal galaxies and agn , as calibrated by hornschemeier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . using this diagram",
    ", we identify the x - ray detected agn within our @xmath3sample and , in particular , those at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "some agn with weak soft x - ray fluxes but significant emission in the hard bands can contaminate the normal galaxy region in the @xmath60-band magnitude versus soft x - ray flux diagram .",
    "these agn are characterised by a flat photon index @xmath63 ( e.g. hornschemeier et al .",
    "we also looked for these kinds of objects to identify the agn present in our sample .",
    "it is known , however , that the x - ray selection can be incomplete for the selection of agn .",
    "other active galaxies exist , which are not detected even in deep x - rays surveys . a complementary method to select active galaxies",
    "can be developed based on the analysis of the ir colour excess in the _ spitzer _ irac bands .",
    "figure [ fig_irac ] shows the ( 3.6-@xmath64 ) versus ( 5.8-@xmath64 ) colours for all the galaxies with redshift @xmath65 in our @xmath3sample .",
    "empty circles correspond to all those galaxies not classified as agn using x - ray data ( either not detected in x - rays or x - ray sources classified as starbursts ) .",
    "filled squares indicate the x - ray classified agn .",
    "we restrict this diagram to high redshift sources for the following reason .",
    "the stellar bump centred at rest - frame wavelength @xmath66 is shifted into the irac bands at @xmath67 $ \\sim$}}~}1.5 $ ] . for active galaxies , the galaxy sed at the same rest - frame wavelengths is dominated by a power - law continuum . thus",
    ", it is expected that an irac - based colour - colour diagram is able to separate the agn through their ir excess . at low redshifts ,",
    "this separation is much less clear , especially because star - forming galaxies with pah emission can mimic the ir excess .",
    "similar colour - colour plots have been used with the purpose of separating normal and active galaxies elsewhere ( e.g. lacy et al .",
    "2004 ; stern et al . 2005 ; caputi et al .",
    ".    inspection of figure [ fig_irac ] shows that x - ray - selected agn display a wide range of ( 3.6-@xmath64 ) and ( 5.8-@xmath64 ) colours , while the vast majority of `` normal galaxies '' ( i.e. non x - ray - classified agn ) appear on the left - hand side of this diagram , with a colour ( 5.8-@xmath64 ) @xmath38 $ \\sim$}}~}0.2 $ ] ( ab ) .",
    "as we mentioned above , the relatively blue colours are produced by the stellar sed bump mapped at the irac wavelengths .",
    "the galaxies lying on the right - hand side , on the contrary , present an excess in the sed continuum which is characteristic of agn .",
    "thus , based on this diagram , we adopt an empirical colour cut to produce an additional agn selection criterion : all the @xmath65 galaxies with ( 5.8-@xmath64 ) @xmath68 ( ab ) within our sample are classified as agn .",
    "this same additional agn selection criterion has been used by caputi et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "we would like to note that , while this colour cut produces a safe criterion to select additional active galaxies , it is possibly not complete .",
    "the dispersion of colours displayed by x - ray - selected agn suggests that other active sources not detected in x - rays and with no irac colour excess could also exist among the @xmath3galaxies . on the other hand , some of the x - ray classified agn could be composite systems , where a fraction of the bolometric ir luminosity is actually due to star formation .",
    "unfortunately , no agn selection criterion appears to be both complete and reliable at the same time ( cf .",
    "e.g. barmby et al .",
    "as we do not have information on the far - ir emission of our galaxies , our separation criteria are possibly the most adequate to discriminate agn .    for our sample of 227 @xmath3galaxies with redshift @xmath24 , only the x - ray criteria have been applied .",
    "we identify 23 out of 227 galaxies as agn , i.e. @xmath69 of the sample .",
    "we will exclude the agn from our sample in order to determine the ir lf for star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 , but we note that the inclusion of agn only has a minor impact on the lf at this redshift .    for the sample at redshifts",
    "@xmath25 , we applied both selection criteria to separate agn ( x - ray and irac - colour classifications ) .",
    "the fraction of active galaxies at these redshifts appears to be more important than at @xmath18 .",
    "we identify 29 agn among our 161 @xmath3galaxies at @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath70 of the sample .",
    "23 out of these 29 agn have been identified using x - rays and the remaining 6 agn have been classified through their irac colours .",
    "as we will see below , the lf computed including and excluding agn have non - negligible differences , because these objects dominate the bright end of the ir lf at these high redshifts . throughout this paper ,",
    "when we refer to the star - forming galaxies at redshift @xmath8 , we mean our sample of 161 - 29=132 objects which we have not classified as agn at these redshifts .",
    "before computing the rest - frame @xmath0lf at @xmath8 , we aim to understand its evolution from @xmath5 to redshift @xmath1 . for this , we compute the rest - frame @xmath0lf for our 204 @xmath3-selected star - forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath24 .",
    "agn have been excluded from this analysis .",
    "agn constitute @xmath69 of our sample with @xmath24 and their exclusion does not significantly change the shape of the @xmath0lf at @xmath1 .",
