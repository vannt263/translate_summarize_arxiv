    "around the milky way ( mw ) galaxy orbit nearly two dozen known satellite galaxies that have a range of magnitudes down to twenty times fainter than the mw itself .",
    "the two brightest satellites , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , are approximately two and four magnitudes fainter than the mw , respectively .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that there is a @xmath1 chance that a @xmath2 , mw - mass dark matter halo hosts two satellites as massive as the magellanic clouds  @xcite . from an observational perspective , analysis of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey",
    "seventh data release ( sdss dr7 ) indicates that mw magnitude - galaxies have two galaxies as bright as the magellanic clouds only @xmath3 of the time , and on average have @xmath4 satellites within four magnitudes of the mw  @xcite .",
    "thus the mw is somewhat atypical in having two satellites with this luminosity difference , but the probability of having a given number at this scale is in excellent agreement between theory and observation ( see further discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .    beyond the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , the brightest satellites are the sagittarius , fornax , and leo i dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) , approximately six , eight , and nine magnitudes fainter than the mw , respectively . though at present challenging , a measurement of the abundance of satellite galaxies as bright as these classical dsphs is important for several reasons .",
    "from the observational perspective , it improves our understanding of the mw and its place on a cosmic scale , providing information on the number of bright satellites around other galaxies over a regime in which we are believed to be complete around the mw  @xcite , in particular away from the galactic plane  @xcite . from the theoretical perspective ,",
    "understanding the abundance of classical dsphs is important because these objects reside in the least massive dark matter halos that contain visible light , corresponding to halo mass scales at which various processes including supernova feedback effects and suppression of gas accretion from reionization becomes important  @xcite .",
    "though the above processes certainly affect the formation of dsphs , theoretical models that include them have still found it challenging to match both the distribution of luminosities of the bright mw satellites and their kinematic properties  @xcite .",
    "estimates of the luminosity function down to scales of the classical dsphs predict that they reside in dark matter halos with velocity dispersions @xmath5 km / s  @xcite .",
    "these models typically predict tens of satellites brighter than fornax , @xmath6 .",
    "both of these predictions are in tension with observations of the mw satellite population .",
    "on the one hand , the predicted velocity dispersion for bright satellites is nearly two times larger than the observed @xmath7 km / s velocity dispersion of bright dsphs . on the other hand ,",
    "since the observational sample is complete for objects with reasonable surface brightness with luminosity @xmath8 , it is difficult to invoke that a population of objects this luminous has been missed by observations .    more detailed analysis of dsph kinematics indicates that their maximum circular velocities are @xmath9 km / s  @xcite .",
    "in particular , even though it is very bright , fornax has a strongly constrained maximum circular velocity at a relatively low @xmath10 km / s . matching these results with numerical simulations of the galactic satellite population in a @xmath0cdm cosmology",
    "@xcite indicates that on average there should be @xmath11 of dark matter satellites with maximum circular velocity greater than that of fornax , that are either too faint to be detected in surveys or devoid of baryonic material entirely  @xcite .",
    "the above results indicate that from a combination of observations and theory , the classical problem of the abundance of satellites within @xmath0cdm  can be boiled down to a  fornax problem \" : more specifically , why is it that for an observed galaxy at the luminosity scale of @xmath12 , there are scores of dark subhalos that have the same dark matter mass , but apparently no stars in them at all",
    "? there are a few outstanding ideas that remain to answer this question .",
    "first , the tension may point directly to severe inefficiency and stochasticity of galaxy formation at the dark matter halo mass scale of the dsphs .",
    "second , it may be that there are required modifications to the current sample of numerical simulations : in particular , baryons may significantly modify the dark matter distributions in satellites ( e.g. @xcite ) , or there may even be a necessary modification to the cosmological model  @xcite .",
    "the third idea is perhaps the most straightforward of all ; namely , that the mw is rare amongst galaxies of its kind , a result of a rare downward fluctuation in its population of bright satellites .    in this paper",
    ", we address for the first time this latter issue of the distribution of satellites as bright as the classical dsphs around mw - analog galaxies .",
    "we construct an observational sample of spectroscopic galaxies like the mw using sdss , and search for faint satellites using sdss dr8 imaging data and photometric redshift probability distributions . at the faintest end , we place an upper limit on the number of satellites down to the magnitude scale of the leo i dsph . at the brightest end , we find an average of @xmath13 objects brighter than sagittarius .",
    "our results imply that , in terms of its bright dsph satellite population , the mw does not stand out as a significant statistical outlier .",
    "our analysis begins by selecting mw - analog galaxies , which is similar to the analysis presented in  @xcite .",
    "we refer to these galaxies as primaries .",
    "we use a magnitude for the mw of @xmath14  @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath15  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussion ) , and we consider primaries within @xmath16 magnitudes of this value .",
    "we consider a second set of slightly brighter galaxies , with @xmath17 , for comparison with m31 .",
    "primary galaxies are selected from the nasa - sloan atlas ( v0_1_1 ) , which combines sdss data for nearby galaxies ( @xmath18 ) with more complete spectroscopy and imaging from galex .",
    "we limit our analysis to isolated galaxies that have no galaxy with a luminosity equal to or greater than the mw or m31 within 0.4 mpc ( following the same methods described in @xcite ) .",
    "we make a few cuts to exclude very nearby galaxies which may have incorrect photometry , specifically those with @xmath19 , size < 5*sersic_th50 , or with @xmath20 .    to perform the search for satellites around mw and m31-analogs",

    "we now detail specifically how each of these estimates are obtained in turn .      our first method for estimating @xmath50 and @xmath51 uses spectroscopic redshifts for both primaries and satellites .",
    "since the dr8 sample is spectroscopically - complete down to @xmath52 , we are able to estimate the number of satellites brighter than @xmath53 . as indicated in table  [",

    "second , we impose a cut so that both the galaxies in the signal region and the galaxies in the background region lie within a redshift @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) of the primary .",
    "this redshift cut is appropriate when accounting for both the expected physical size of the dark matter halos of the primaries , and for redshift space distortions .",
    "using spectroscopic redshifts to identify satellites clearly reduces background contamination from galaxies at vastly different redshifts than the primary . however , the obvious downside is that , when demanding the satellites have a spectroscopic redshift , the sample of primaries is much smaller than the corresponding sample of primaries obtained by only demanding complete photometry for the satellites .",
    "further , when restricting to spectroscopic satellites we run out of very bright primaries , meaning we are unable to probe very faint magnitude differences , @xmath59 , that are the main goal of this work .      for our second estimate of @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ", we use the photometric galaxy sample of  @xcite , which is complete down to @xmath21 . in this case",

    "search for galaxies within the signal region @xmath56 kpc .",
    "given this set of galaxies in the signal region , we then sample each of their corresponding discrete @xmath62 distributions .",
    "this provides us with a redshift for each galaxy within the signal region . from a single sampling of each @xmath62 distribution ,",
    "we determine the total number of galaxies that fall into the redshift bin that contains the primary . to obtain a statistically robust estimate of the total signal and background probability distributions ,",
    "we repeat the sampling procedure @xmath64 times to obtain the mean number of counts in the signal region in the same redshift bin as the primary , @xmath65 . then following a similar reasoning as above",
    ", we repeat this procedure for the annular background region to obtain the corresponding mean number of counts in the redshift bin associated with the background for each primary , @xmath66 .",
    "as long as the photometric redshift distribution for each galaxy is unbiased , the estimate of the number of satellites obtained from this method is expected to be just as accurate as the estimate that uses spectroscopic redshifts .",

    "is the fact that the training set used in  @xcite to obtain the photometric redshifts may not have a fully representative sample of faint , low redshift galaxies .",

    "the four panels in figure  [ fig : fullpz ] show the mean number of satellites around mw - like primaries that are brighter than @xmath23 magnitudes fainter than the primary , @xmath67 , for the three methods described above . in each of the four panels",
    ", there is a different threshold cut on the magnitude of signal and background galaxies for the two methods that use photometric redshifts ( methods 2 and 3 ) . from left to right , the magnitude cuts on signal and background galaxies are @xmath68 .",
    "results from the spectroscopic analysis ( method 1 ) are shown as blue diamonds in all panels ; by definition this method only includes galaxies in the signal and background regions with @xmath22 .",
    "results from the full @xmath62 sampling analysis ( method 2 ) are shown as red triangles , and from the cut on mean photometric redshifts ( method 3 ) are shown as black squares .",
    "figure  [ fig : fullpz ] indicates that for satellites with @xmath69 ( leftmost panel ) , we find good agreement between all three methods , with large error bars for the method using simple @xmath62 cuts . for these primaries",
    ", the @xmath62 distribution is determined by galaxies in the main sample of sdss , so the training sample is expected to be fully representative .",
    "the agreement between methods 1 and 2 is maintained for @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( left two panels ) .",
    "however , we find that this agreement weakens for @xmath72 , where the mean abundances as determined from method 2 underestimate the results from the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "this underestimation is most evident in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fullpz ] , and as discussed above most likely indicates that galaxies with @xmath73 and @xmath74 are not adequately represented in the training sets .",
    "in addition , as expected , method 3 tends to overestimate the mean abundance for all @xmath23 and all magnitude limits .",
    "this is true both in the regime in which @xmath75 , for satellites with @xmath76 ( left three panels ) , and @xmath77 , and for satellites with @xmath78 ( right panel ) .",
    "these results indicate that the photometric redshift distributions for satellites dimmer than @xmath79 are likely biased towards higher redshifts , as a result of increasing incompleteness in the very lowest redshift galaxies in the training sample for dimmer galaxies .    what leads to this bias in the photometric redshifts , and is it avoidable ?",
    "first , it is important to realize that our regime of interest is _ very _ low redshift , @xmath80 , well outside the redshift range where photometric redshifts are generally used and tested .",
    "the @xmath62 distributions calculated by @xcite use training sets from sdss  @xcite , primus  @xcite , zcosmos  @xcite , 2slaq  @xcite , vvds  @xcite , deep2  @xcite , cnoc2  @xcite , cfrs  @xcite , and tkrs  @xcite . for galaxies in our main regime of interest , @xmath81 , the training sample is dominated by primus ( * ? ? ? * , cool et al , in preparation ) , which covers more than 9 sq .",
    "degrees to a depth of @xmath82 ( 5.2 sq .",
    "degrees are included in the current training set ) . for primus , which is focused on science at @xmath83 , there are at least two distinct issues that impact our analysis .",
    "first , the 4000  break falls out of the wavelength regime for @xmath84 ; without this feature the low - redshift spectra were more likely to be assigned a lower confidence flag ( @xmath85 ) and were excluded in the @xmath62 estimation ( carlos cunha , private communication ) .",
    "second , the analysis pipeline does not even attempt to measure accurate redshifts in the regime of our primaries ( @xmath80 ) because of the limited velocity resolution of the low - dispersion prism used by primus ( john moustakas & alison coil , private communication ) .",
    "both of these will impact the completeness of the low redshift sample and are likely to bias the @xmath62 distribution against the redshift range of our primary samples .",
    "one might also consider whether the biased @xmath62 distribution could be avoided with another photometric redshift code .",
    "however , this range is challenging for any algorithm .",
    "for example , template - fitting codes without priors have known failure modes at very low redshift @xcite , and this would likely contaminate the low redshift sample .    from the information in figure  [ fig : fullpz ] we are able to obtain our best estimate for @xmath86 over the entire range of @xmath87 . specifically for our best estimate of",
    "@xmath86 we use the spectroscopic results for @xmath88 , and the results from method 3 for @xmath59 .",

    "the results from method 3 are explicitly shown in the 6th column of table  [ tab : properties ] , and the results from method 1 are shown in the last column of table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "note that for the cases with a small number of primaries , which for our mw sample corresponds to @xmath89 , only an upper limit on the mean can be determined .",
    "@xcite report that the satellite population is uncertain in the central 100 kpc around primary galaxies due to contamination from features in the extended halos of primaries .",
    "we have directly examined the images of many nearby , bright primaries and find that generally this systematic is accounted for in the  @xcite galaxy sample used in our analysis .",
    "in addition we have explicitly examined how our results are affected when excluding the 100 kpc around primaries , and we generally find minimal changes relative to those results presented in fig .",

    "upper limit on the mean reduces from 13 to 9 when excluding the central 100 kpc .",
    "in addition to the distribution of the mean number of satellites , from our likelihood analysis we are able to estimate the intrinsic scatter , or @xmath90 , for each magnitude bin . as for the mean , @xmath90 is determined from the full probability density distribution using eq .",

    "the spectroscopic sample is too sparse to measure the full satellite probability distribution .",
    "these results indicate that there is still substantial intrinsic scatter in the satellite population , even at the brightest scales .",
    "we note that the limits we present are strictly valid over the regime of surface brightness where the sdss dr8 data is complete .",
    "for galaxies with half - light surface brightness @xmath98 mag / acrmin@xmath99 , which is the surface brightness of leo i , the sdss spectroscopic data is @xmath100 complete  @xcite . for galaxies with surface brightness similar to fornax or sculptor , @xmath101 mag / acrmin@xmath99 ,",
    "the surface brightness completeness is @xmath102 .",
    "we note that the surface brightness incompleteness has not been estimated directly for the photometric sample , but the agreement our results between the two sets of samples indicates that the issues may be of similar magnitude .",
    "we can get an estimate as to how the surface brightness incompleteness affects our results by comparing the integrated luminosity function of  @xcite that is corrected for incompleteness , as compared to the measured luminosity function . down to the magnitude of fornax , for example we find that the luminosity functions differ by a factor @xmath13 going to down surface brightness of 24 mag / acrmin@xmath99 .",
    "if interested in constraining the population of objects down to this surface brightness , this factor should be taken as a conservative correction to the limits that are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mean ] .",
    "thus in order to obtain many more bright satellites than are observed in the mw , it is clear that these satellites must have surface brightness much dimmer than the known bright mw satellites .",
    "there have been several recent analyses on the population of bright satellites around mw - analog galaxies along the lines presented in this paper .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results presented here to these previous analyses .",
    "@xcite used sdss dr7 to construct the luminosity function of satellites down to the magnitude scale of fornax , correcting for the incompleteness of sdss .",

    "we also directly quantify the bias in abundance counts for faint satellites that is incurred when utilizing available photometric redshifts . via somewhat different methods for cutting background galaxies ,  @xcite use dr7 data to obtain a mean number of satellites down to the magnitude of sagittarius for projected radii @xmath103 kpc .",
    "as we discuss above , we have verified that our results are consistent with these authors over the radial range considered , and further that we do not incur a significant bias by including galaxies within projected radii @xmath104 kpc .",
    "@xcite utilize the dr7 volume - limited spectroscopic sample and find that @xmath105 of mw - analogs have satellites brighter than the lmc within 250 kpc .",
    "@xcite use h@xmath106 narrow band imaging to search for start forming galaxies around 143 spiral galaxies like the mw , and find that nearly two - thirds do not have satellites that resemble the magellanic clouds .",
    "these latter two results are consistent with the spectroscopic results that we present for bright satellites .",
    "we have used dr8 photometric redshift data to limit the mean number of satellites around mw - analog galaxies down to ten magnitudes fainter than the mw . at least down to the scale of sagittarius ,",
    "the results indicate that the mw is not a significant statistical outlier in its number of bright , classical satellites .",
    "our 90% c.l .",
    "upper bound of @xmath107 satellites brighter than the fornax dsph already places a strict bound on the efficiency of galaxy formation at the dsph luminosity scale .",
    "this is particularly true considering that there are anywhere from @xmath11 dark matter subhalos in the aquarius simulations  @xcite that have present - day circular velocities greater than that of fornax .",
    "surface brightness incompleteness could increase this number , but likely not enough to bring it into agreement with predictions for the number of dense satellites in simulations .",
    "however , it is very interesting to note that the observational result we present is perfectly consistent with abundance matching extrapolations for the satellite luminosity function , which predict @xmath108 satellites for magnitude differences @xmath109  @xcite .",
    "this does not guarentee that such models will have the correct velocity function ; in fact it appears increasingly difficult to simultaneously match both the luminosities and velocities of all of the satellites down to the fornax scale .    in the future it will be exceedingly important to increase the sample of primary galaxies around which it is possible to measure satellites as faint as fornax .",
    "measuring the magnitude distribution at this faint scale will go a long way towards determining if the mapping between bright dsphs and dark matter subhalos is revealing the presence of detailed baryonic physics not yet accounted for in numerical simulations  @xcite or about the properties of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the principle uncertainty in accurately determining the satellite distribution from the sdss photometric sample is the fidelity of the photometric redshifts .",
    "we have shown that our method using the full photometric redshift distribution is in excellent agreement with a method that directly uses spectroscopic redshifts for bright satellites where the training sample is representative . however , this method is biased to lower satellite numbers for dimmer magnitudes , which is an indication that the spectroscopic training samples used to construct the photometric redshift distributions are systematically missing the lowest redshift galaxies .",
    "our measurements would be substantially improved if these samples were unbiased , as this would allow us to use the @xmath62 method for a substantially larger number of host galaxies",
    ". it may be possible in the very near future to extend the training sample to include data from gama , extending to @xmath76 , which would allow us to extend our measurement using the @xmath62 method to the fornax scale . with some care ,",
    "it may also be possible to refine and improve the primus redshift finder in the range relevant to our low - redshift primaries ( @xmath110 ) , thereby providing a more reliable photometric redshift training sample .    given forthcoming data sets it will also be possible to significantly increase the number of primary galaxies ; for example , the dark energy survey ( des ) will produce a survey over 5000 sq .",
    "degrees and will observe galaxies to 24.3 in the @xmath111-band . if one considers satellites down to @xmath112 , the des is expected to identify more than 4000 primaries with satellites to fornax magnitude differences , about 1600 primaries with leo i - like satellites , and nearly 100 primaries with satellites as dim relative to their primary as sculptor is to the milky way . at the fornax scale",
    ", the statistics should be large enough to get a solid measurement using background subtraction even without robust photometric redshifts .",
    "the analysis here indicates that the primary challenge for the dimmest satellites around these primaries will be determining their redshift distribution .    in the future it will also be important to obtain kinematics on spectroscopically - confirmed satellites , as well as those that have a high probability to be satellites from their photometric redshifts . comparing the velocity dispersion of these satellites to the @xmath7 km / s",

    "<S> we study the abundance of satellites akin to the brightest , classical dwarf spheroidals around galaxies similar in magnitude and isolation to the milky way and m31 in the sloan digital sky survey . from a combination of photometric and spectroscopic redshifts , we bound the mean and the intrinsic scatter in the number of satellites down to ten magnitudes fainter than the milky way . restricting to magnitudes brighter than sagittarius </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the milky way is not a significant statistical outlier in its population of classical dwarf spheroidals . at fainter magnitudes </S>",
    "<S> , we find an upper limit of 13 on the mean number of satellites brighter than the fornax dwarf spheroidal . </S>",
    "<S> methods to improve these limits that utilize full photometric redshift distributions hold promise , but are currently limited by incompleteness at the very lowest redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical models are left to explain why the majority of dark matter subhalos that orbit milky way - like galaxies are inefficient at making galaxies at the luminosity scale of the brightest dwarf spheroidals , or why these subhalos predicted by @xmath0cdm  do not exist . </S>"
