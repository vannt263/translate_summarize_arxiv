    "mass loss from giant stars follows a two - stage process .",
    "chromospheric or magneto - acoustically - driven mass loss occurs during a star s red giant branch ( rgb ) and early asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) evolution , when warm ( @xmath06000 k ) plasma is ejected from the surface ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "although initially faster , this wind slows to @xmath010 km s@xmath4 at the luminosity of the rgb tip @xcite .",
    "later , @xmath19-mechanism pulsations can levitate material from the star , enhancing the mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "strongly linked to this pulsation is the formation of dust in the denser stellar atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiation pressure on this dust drives the stellar wind in a cooler outflow , also of typically @xmath010 km s@xmath4 , rising with stellar luminosity to @xmath020 km s@xmath4 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "although dust production begins at luminosities below the rgb tip @xcite , sufficient radiation pressure to drive the wind is only achieved once the star reaches @xmath010005000 l@xmath3 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the expansion velocities of metal - poor stellar winds are poorly known .",
    "the stars are smaller compared to metal - rich stars at the same luminosity , so pulsations are thought to be weaker @xcite .",
    "the stellar surface resides deeper in the gravitational potential , so material must be levitated further before reaching temperatures where dust can condense .",
    "we also expect the dust : gas ratio will decrease , meaning that the associated mass - loss rate and velocity enhancements will also decrease .",
    "the transition between a chromospheric and pulsation - enhanced , dust - driven wind should consequently happen at a higher luminosity @xcite . without measurement of these expansion velocities ,",
    "however , these theories remain untested .",
    "the wind expansion velocity is an important parameter in determining mass - loss rates from radiative transfer modelling of infrared excesses , which is a valuable method of determining the mass of both dust and gas ejected by giant stars , and the only method currently feasible outside our galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once material leaves the star it is reprocessed , first by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and then by interstellar shocks .",
    "other unknowns then become important in determining how quickly dust is destroyed , molecules are dissociated , and atoms ionised .",
    "contributing factors include the star - formation history of the population ( setting the uv flux from high - mass main - sequence , low - mass horizontal - branch and post - agb stars ) , the amount of interstellar dust shielding , and the local stellar density .",
    "there is a growing realisation that the enrivonment in which stars lie can have profound effects on their molecular and mineralogical yields @xcite .",
    "nowhere is this more strongly felt than globular clusters .",
    "the preparation of this work sparked the theory that ionisation should exert a powerful control over the interstellar environment of globular clusters @xcite .",
    "very strong isrfs should be generated by post - agb stars and the hottest white dwarfs , but the short - lived nature of these objects means the isrf is constantly varying .",
    "not only should these sources be capable of dissociating and ionising the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , but they also provide the icm with enough thermal energy that it overflows the globular cluster , preventing further star formation .",
    "we now turn our attention to the circumstellar environments of globular cluster stars .",
    "many of the above issues can be addressed by observing co lines emanating from the winds of stars in globular clusters .",
    "co is one of the first molecules to form as the extended atmosphere of the star is ejected , and it survives until its dissociation by the isrf .",
    "this dissociation is mainly by photo - absorption in molecular lines , hence even in the absence of dust , self - shielding can be important in protecting co in stellar winds .",
    "observationally , the widths of co lines provide a direct measurement of the wind - expansion velocity , while their strength provides an independent estimate of mass - loss rate .",
    "their strengths are also affected by the characteristic radius from the star at which co is dissociated by the isrf @xcite .",
    "hence , by comparing the strength of co lines from stars with known mass - loss rates to model predictions , we can quantify the strength of the isrf to which they are subjected .    in this paper , we report on observations with the atacama large millimetre array ( alma ) of the four brightest stars in 47 tucanae .",
    "section [ topobssect ] describes these observations , and defines upper limits to the non - detections we find .",
    "section [ codisssect ] models the expected mass - loss rate from the star , the size of the co envelope , and calculate the expected strength of the co transitions .",
    "this is done under the assumption that the isrf is strong dissociating the co envelope .",
    "results are discussed in section [ discsect ] .",
    "alternative scenarios which might remove the co envelopes of our target stars are explored in the appendix .",
    "among the closest and most populous globular clusters is the intermediate - metallicity cluster 47 tuc ( ngc 104 ; 4.5 kpc , [ fe / h ] = 0.72 dex , @xmath20 = 1.5 @xmath1 10@xmath21 m@xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this cluster was chosen partly because its stars show a relatively small spread in chemical abundances compared to other clusters of similar size @xcite , and partly because it contains a well - studied set of luminous , dusty agb stars .",
    "the cluster s variable stars have a unique , long and well - covered history @xcite . infrared photometry and spectra",
    "have been published at many wavelengths over many epochs @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy of the brightest variables @xcite show a mixture of silicate and alumina dust features , and a potential featureless contribution from metallic iron dust ( cf .",
    "this combination has led to several estimates of their dust - production rates @xcite .",
    "high - resolution optical spectroscopy of moderately bright giants suggest relatively slow outflows from the stellar chromospheres of @xmath010 km s@xmath4 @xcite . near - infrared spectroscopy",
    "@xcite shows that the brightest stars have abundances similar to other stars in the cluster .",
    "they have not experienced substantial third dredge - up , and perhaps have not experienced any third dredge - up episodes .",
    "we present sub - mm co observations of the four most luminous , most evolved stars in 47 tuc .",
    "they are denoted by @xcite as v1 , v2 , v3 and v8 .",
    "previously published parameters of these stars from the above references are given in tables [ starstable ] and [ windstable ] .",
    "in particular , table [ windstable ] gives the mass - loss rate ( @xmath6 ) and wind velocity ( @xmath7 ) predicted for a purely radiation - driven wind .",
    "@xcite derived these on the basis of radiative transfer modelling of their infrared spectra using the dusty code @xcite with a radiation - driven wind ( density type = 3 ) .",
    "in all four cases , the spectral energy distributions were best modelled with a mostly metallic iron wind , with some stars having contributions from amorphous and crystalline silicates , aluminium oxide and iron oxide .",
    "table [ windstable ] also gives the mass - loss rate expected for a purely magneto - acoustically driven wind , as derived from semi - empirical scaling laws applied to the cluster s other stars ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ; see section [ mdotsect ] ) .",

    "the visibilities from these three antenna were downweighted .",
    "this was accomplished using the uvtaper parameter set to true and the outaper option set to 1.5@xmath28 in casa s clean task @xcite .",
    "in addition to this a restoring beam of @xmath29 was also applied at the cleaning stage .",
    "these techniques were used to generate images with a beam more representative of the antennae in the centre of the array .",
    "imaging additional to that provided with the alma data release was conducted in casa using the clean routine to create two data cubes for each source , one with a binning of ten spectral channels ( channel width : 3.2 km s@xmath4 bin@xmath4 ) and one with two - channel binning ( 0.64 km s@xmath4 bin@xmath4 ) .",

    "neither the alma nor the apex data showed any convincing indication of spectrally resolved co emission ( e.g.  departure from gaussian noise centred around zero flux ) .",
    "the only previous significant co observations of the cluster are by @xcite , who claim a weak co ( 1@xmath220 ) detection around the cluster s velocity with a signal - to - noise ratio of 3 .",

    "the co emission is expected to be spatially unresolved by alma and the mass - loss rate is expected to be sufficiently low that the lines will be optically thin .",

    "these may indicate a tentative detection of the co line , but we do not consider them reliable as they are only at the 1.3 and 2.1@xmath23 confidence levels , respectively .",
    "our observations were carried out under the nave assumption that the envelopes of our target stars behave as galactic stars do . in this section ,",
    "we show that we could expect a similar galactic star to be observable at the distance of 47 tucanae .",
    "this provides a baseline to which we can compare our final model .",

    "[ windstable ] , we can modestly expect @xmath44 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , depending on the star and the method used .",

    "@xcite also predicts that the co(32 ) flux should be around twice as strong .",
    "a less conservative value of @xmath50 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 produces 1200 mjy km s@xmath4 for the co(21 ) line , implying 2400 mjy km s@xmath4 for the co(32 ) line , or 1.2@xmath23 in our apex observation .",

    "mass - loss rates of stars without dust - driven winds are comparatively well determined and have been parameterised into scaling relations .",

    ", the following efficiency parameters were derived for the median stars in globular clusters : @xmath56 where each value is given with its respective statistical and systematic error on the rgb ( @xmath57 ) , and a higher @xmath51 on the agb ( @xmath58 ) .",

    "we derive the minimum mass - loss rates listed in table [ windstable ] of @xmath60 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 and @xmath61 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 .",
    "these values are appropriate for ` stable ' stars , without extra energy from pulsations or radiation pressure on dust .",
    "while the interplay of pulsations on transfer of magneto - acoustic energy to the chromosphere is poorly determined , we would expect these values to provide a lower limit to the mass - loss rate from pulsating , dusty agb stars .",
    "the mass lost from an agb star during the last part of its life must not exceed the envelope mass of the star at the beginning of that period .",
    "low - luminosity agb stars are not easily seperable from rgb stars .",
    "agb stars can only be uniquely identified once they exceed the luminosity of the rgb tip . if we can determine both the remaining lifetime of an agb star passing the luminosity of the rgb tip , and the envelope mass it has when it does so ,",
    "the quotient of the two should yield the average mass - loss rate of agb stars above the rgb - tip luminosity .",
    "the time spent above the rgb tip is relatively easy to compute .",
    "our four stars lie above the rgb of 47 tuc . for the purposes of these calculations",
    ", we also include the fifth - brightest star in the cluster .",
    "v4 is a probable agb star at the luminosity of the rgb tip ( see the hertzsprung ",

    "it shows long - period pulsations and an infrared excess , consistent with circumstellar dust production .",
    "assuming there are typically 5 @xmath62 @xmath63 stars above the cluster s rgb tip , and taking an evolutionary rate of one star passing the rgb tip every 80000 years @xcite , these five stars should represent the last 0.40 @xmath62 0.18 myr of agb evolution in the cluster .",

    "we assume this is also representative of the distribution of more - evolved , hotter post - agb stars . for each catalogued source , we assign a physical depth within the cluster . assuming an earth - to - cluster distance of 4500 pc , we randomly select a source nearby in right ascension to each star and use the declination of the random source to assign a radial distance from the cluster centre for each target source .",
    "this creates a stellar distribution with the same radial density profile as the density profile in declination , approximating a spherically symmetric distribution .",
    "we then take the post - agb stellar evolution model of @xcite , following the emitted spectrum as it evolves through its upper - agb , post - agb and hot - white - dwarf evolution .",

    "dissociation can therefore take place in an unshielded environment , if the time to intercept a uv photon is large compared to the time taken to reach the @xmath67 layer , or a shielded environment if it is smaller .",
    "if shielding is not important , the co dissociation radius will be limited simply by the average time it takes a co molecule to encounter an interstellar uv photon , and the co dissociation radius around metal - poor stars should be very similar to metal - rich stars .",
