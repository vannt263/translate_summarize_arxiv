    "more than 30 years after their discovery , thanks to the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) and the italian - dutch satellite bepposax , the scientific community now knows that gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are isotropically distributed in the sky ( fishman @xmath0 meegan 1995 ) and that at least some of them are at cosmological distances ( grb970228 : djorgovski et al .",

    "but the present data available for redshift position and host galaxy localization are still too few to give us good statistics to study the evolution of grbs and their redshift distribution . before the discovery of grb afterglows by bepposax ,",
    "the only way to study their distributions was to compare some grb properties ( like for example the intensity ) , with some parametric models ( fenimore @xmath0 bloom 1995 , cohen @xmath0 piran 1995 , kommers et al . 1999 ) . because of this lack of information , it is still necessary to assume that grbs follow the statistical distribution of some other better known objects to obtain the grbs fluence or flux distribution itself .",
    "the origin of grbs is still controversial . according to different models ,",
    "their progenitor can be identified with the merging of two neutron stars , or with the collapse of a massive star . in the model presented by pugliese et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , grbs are created inside a pre - existing jet in a binary system formed by a neutron star and an o / b / wr companion , where the input energy comes from the collapse of the neutron star into a black hole and the emission is due to synchrotron radiation from the ultrarelativistic shock waves that propagate along the jet with a low - energy cut - off in the electron distribution . following this scenario ,",
    "the birth of grbs can not happen too far from the region where the progenitor formed , and this implies that their rate should be connected with the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "already other authors studied the connection between the sfr and grbs flux distribution .",
    "for example , wijers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that the assumption that the grb rate is proportional to the sfr in the universe is consistent with the grb flux distribution .    in sect .",
    "2 we calculate the cumulative distribution of grb fluences using two sfr distributions as a function of redshift , the one by miyaji ( miyaji et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the other by madau ( madau et al . 1996 ) .",

    "4 we present our results for the contribution of grbs to the cosmic rays distribution , both galactic and extragalactic and in sect .",
    "5 the eventual contribution from grbs to the neutrino flux .",
    "the aim of this section is the calculation of the number of grbs per year and per 100 @xmath1 as a function of redshift , assuming beamed emission in a jet , ( e.g. pugliese et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the following calculations are quite general and we emphasize that their validity does not depend on the particular model used .    to obtain a result as close as possible to the data , we chose the fluence as the quantity that can well represent the characteristics of grbs .",
    "we follow petrosian @xmath0 lloyd ( 1997 ) , who showed that the fluence is the most appropriate parameter to study the cosmological evolution of grbs .",
    "the relation between the redshift @xmath2 and the fluence @xmath3 is given by ( petrosian @xmath0 lloyd 1997 ) as a function of the specific luminosity l expressed in @xmath4 $ ] :    @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the photon flux spectral index , @xmath7 is the cosmological luminosity distance ( weinberg , 1972 ) , and @xmath8 is the hubble constant . in the transformation from the emitter frame to the observer frame the two corresponding redshift contributions from the frequency and the time dependence are cancelled .    in our model ( pugliese et al .",
    "1999 ) , we used @xmath9 , and the corresponding value for the fluence is :    @xmath10    in this way the redshift as a function of the fluence is :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 @xmath13 is the reference fluence and @xmath14 is expressed in @xmath4 $ ] .    at this point of our calculations",
    "it is important to define the role of the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "in fact a relevant question is whether grbs are standard candles ( i.e. @xmath15 is constant ) or whether they are distributed with a luminosity function ( lf ) with , e.g. , a power law in @xmath15 .",
    "developing our calculations , we arrived at the same results found by kommers et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . here",
    "the authors showed that the best model is the one in which the star formation rate is combined with the luminosity function distribution . in agreement with them , also in our model grbs can not be considered as standard candles .",
    "we use a distribution for the luminosity function with a power law index @xmath16 , and the corresponding law for the parameter @xmath15 is given by :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the normalization parameter equal to @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .    here",
    "we do not yet answer the question what the physics of this luminosity function may be .",
    "it is plausible in the context of our model , that it is directly connected to the mass flow in the pre - existing jet prior to the grb explosion . if this were the correct interpretation , the mass accretion rate , and correspondingly , the mass flow rate in the jet may follow a power law distribution , a point which we will pursue elsewhere .",
    "we also calculate the grb rate using two different star formation rates and compare the corresponding results with the data .",
    "the number count of grbs sources is given by the expression @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is equal to the product of the sfr @xmath24 and the luminosity function @xmath25 .",
    "obviously the luminosity function may change with redshift @xmath2 , but for simplicity and as a first step , we use this ansatz . in term of the fluence @xmath3 of grbs in the gamma ray band , and of the reference fluence @xmath15 , the number count is :    @xmath26 { \\biggl [ { { dt } \\over { d z } }         ( f , f_{\\star } ) \\biggr ] } { \\biggl [ 4 \\pi d^2_{\\rm l}(f , f_{\\star } )         { { d \\ , d_{\\rm l } } \\over { d z } } ( f , f_{\\star } ) \\biggr ] }         \\nonumber \\\\ &    & \\times [ d z(f , f_{\\star } ) ] ,   \\label{epicuro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where :    @xmath27 : :    the first term @xmath28 represents the star    formation rate as a function of the redshift .",

    ", we obtain the following rate of grbs :    @xmath64    this value obtained considering beaming effects is close to the number given by piran ( 1999 ) .",
    "the result depends strongly on the power index , while it is not influenced by the interval @xmath43 $ ] of the lf distribution we used .",
    "we defined a lower limit for the fluence equal to @xmath65 , and a ratio @xmath66 equal to @xmath67 .",

    "another important step is to check if it is possible to produce neutrinos and high energy cosmic rays with our model ( pugliese et al .",
    "therefore we calculated the maximum energy available in the emission region .",
    "irrespective of any acceleration mechanism , the maximum energy of charged particles , here protons , is that given by the spatial limit in the comoving frame , where the gyromotion just fits the space available :    @xmath70    here @xmath71 is the charge of an electron , @xmath72 is the magnetic field in the shock frame given by @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the thickness of the emission region . for the calculation of the thickness",
    "we have two possibilities , and each of them corresponds to one of the following cases :    @xmath27 : :    for the first case we used the thickness of the emission region in the    shock frame ( sh ) , given by @xmath75 :    +    @xmath76 @xmath27 : :    in the second case we considered the width of the shell :    +    @xmath77    at this point it is necessary to check when the thickness of the emission region is lower than the width , which corresponds to @xmath78 . to do this we calculated the time at which these two quantities are equal :    @xmath79    it means that for about two months @xmath80 .",
    "obviously , only @xmath81 is valid , so after 10 seconds the upper limit of the maximum energy available in our model is about @xmath82 , while after two months the energy to consider is @xmath83 .",
    "adiabatic losses will diminish these energies for charged particles like protons .",
    "cosmic rays are ionized nuclei , mainly protons , that extend from low energies ( few hundred mev ) up to very high energies ( about @xmath84 ev ) . their spectrum is described by a power law @xmath85 , and shows two breaks in the slope . from low energies up to about @xmath86 ev , known as the knee , the spectrum follows a pure power law with @xmath87 .",
    "the detailed shape of this break and the precise position are still unknown . beyond the knee up to about a second break point at @xmath88 ev , known as the ankle",
    ", the pure power law has an index @xmath89 .",
    "it has been proposed ( biermann 1993 , stanev et al .",
    "1993 ) , that three components contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum : a ) explosion of supernovae into a homogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) , accelerating particles up to energies of about @xmath90 gev .",
    "the spectrum for these particles is a power law with an index of -2.75 , after considering the leakage from our galaxy .",
    "b ) explosion of stars into their former stellar wind ( like wolf rayet stars ) , producing particles with energies up to about @xmath91 gev . the corresponding spectrum switches at the knee from -2.67 to -3.07 and this difference in the spectral index derives from a diminution of the particle curvature drift energy gain . in biermann s cosmic ray model for the galactic component ( biermann 1997 ) , the energetic protons are produced in the shocks of supernova explosions in the interstellar medium , while all the heavier elements are produced in the shock waves propagating in the stellar wind of the progenitor star .",
    "c ) production of particles with energies up to @xmath92 gev from the hot spots of fanaroff riley class ii radio galaxies .",
    "their spectrum has an index -2 at the source , and one needs to take the interaction with the cosmological microwave background into account .",
    "we expect the spectrum of cosmic rays above about @xmath93 gev to be strongly attenuated because of the interaction of nuclei and protons with the 2.7 k cosmic microwave background , giving rise to the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cut - off .",
    "the extragalactic sources can not produce all the total cosmic ray energy density observed at earth , but they could give a contribution to the ultra - high energy ( uhe ) part of the spectrum .",
    "the origin of the cosmic rays above @xmath88 ev is not yet clear , but the common idea is that they are extragalactic and probably connected with the most powerful radio galaxies ( biermann @xmath0 strittmatter 1987 , berezinsky @xmath0 grigoreva 1988 , rachen @xmath0 biermann 1993 , rachen et al .",
    "1993 ) . at the moment",
    ", our knowledge of the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays is limited by the small number of events detected by the present experiments . considering that at @xmath94 ev the rate of cosmic rays is about 1 event per @xmath95 per century , it is clear that to detect them it is necessary to have both large aperture detectors and a long exposure time .    in this general context , it is interesting to check the eventual galactic and extragalactic energetic contribution given by grbs to the cosmic ray spectrum in our model .",
    "in fact grbs seem to be very powerful explosions and they inject a large amount of energy and elementary particles into the interstellar medium .",
    "we used the grb rate obtained with the sfr from madau and two different energetic approaches to calculate the contribution from grbs to the cosmic rays and the neutrino spectra .",
    "first we considered that each grb gives the same contribution equal to @xmath96 of a fixed initial energy of @xmath97 .",

    "it is important to identify which particles contribute to the cosmic ray flux . as rachen @xmath0 mszros ( 1998 ) showed , during the main burst protons",
    "lose most of their energy because of adiabatic expansion , while neutrons can be better candidates to obtain ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) and neutrinos .",
    "in fact neutrons carry about @xmath98 of the proton energy , and because they are not coupled to the magnetic field , they can escape the fireball and through the @xmath54-decay give a cosmic ray proton spectrum .",

    "the dotted lines beyond @xmath123 show where interactions with the microwave background may become relevant .",
    "since massive star formation is highest in the galactic central region , any contribution is limited to energies for which the larmor radius becomes as large as the galactic disk , and the agasa data suggest only a small anisotropy at the galactic center . but even if from an energetic point of view , grbs could give a contribution at these high energies , this is ruled out considering that the temporal interval between two grbs in our galaxy is larger than the leakage time of cosmic rays at these energies .",

    "the efficiency for the neutrino production depends on the fraction of proton energy converted into charged pions and on how much energy pions and muons keep before decaying .    some authors ( waxman @xmath0 bahcall 1997 ) , proposed that grbs can be associated with neutrinos produced in the photohadronic reaction .",
    "pions come from the interactions between accelerated protons and gamma rays in the fireball , and their decay produces neutrinos and anti - neutrinos together with other elementary particles .",
    "waxman @xmath0 bahcall ( 1997 ) gave an upper limit for the corresponding neutrino flux .",
    "other authors ( rachen @xmath0 mszros 1998 ) , argued that the upper limit obtained in this way is optimistic .",
    "in fact , protons emitted in the earliest burst do not have enough energy to leave the expansion region because of adiabatic losses .",

    "following the same procedure used to calculate the extragalactic cosmic ray contribution from grbs , we obtained that the normalization factor corresponding to the spectrum @xmath136 in the case in which each grb gives the same contribution to the neutrino spectrum is @xmath137 .",

    "the key point of the second part of the article is the calculation of the grb rate inside and outside our galaxy .",
    "the results we obtained depends mainly on three other parameters , the value of the hubble constant @xmath142 , the opening angle of the jet @xmath143 , and the power law index @xmath6 we assumed for the electron distribution in our model ( see eq .  [ plato ] ) .    the choice of @xmath144 has been done in the first version of our model , where even if we simplified in many places the physics used , we obtained a good agreement with the data .",
    "any possible small changes in this interval will influence the results obtained in this work in a marginal way , because the dependence on @xmath6 in the expression of @xmath102 is not strong .",
    "however , putting @xmath145 , which is not suggested by the data , would strongly influence our results .    on the other hand , changes in @xmath142 and @xmath143 , because of the strong dependence in @xmath102 will influence the results .",
    "it is interesting to note that both , a lower value of the hubble constant and a smaller opening angle of the jet , go into the direction of decreasing @xmath102 .",
    "but these changes can not influence our results because the interactions of cosmic rays with the microwave background and the large difference between the galactic grbs and the leakage time of cr s rule out that _ in our jet model _ grbs can give any contribution beyond @xmath110 ev .    in the calculation of the contribution from grbs to the neutrino flux , it is important to define the parameters that characterize the neutrino production .",
    "the number of hits in the @xmath129 collisions has been obtained considering only the major photohadronic interaction channel , the one that gives a single pion . at higher energies it is possible to have the channels for the production of multi - pions , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , but as the energy increases the corresponding cross sections decrease .",
    "we used only the first channel with the highest cross section , because the energies involved are not high enough to require secondary channels .    in the context of our _ jet - disk symbiosis model _ for grbs , there is only one way to make the extragalactic contribution to crs significant at the highest energies , and that is to drastically increase the cr energies per grb deposited .",
    "we consider this implausible in the context of our model because of energy conservation requirements .",
    "we use @xmath96 of the entire energy available , and so the cr contribution may be increased over our simple calculation by a factor of a few , but not more .",
    "this implies that the contributions given by each grb to cr and neutrino flux can not be much bigger than the energy emitted in the @xmath107-ray band .    using a relatively small set of parameters , the jet - disk symbiosis model applied to grbs , a tested star formation rate and the fundamental physics of the photohadronic interactions we arrive at the conclusion that grbs are not able to give any significant contribution to the high energy cosmic ray spectrum both inside and outside our galaxy and predict only a low flux of neutrinos .",
    "a main conclusion of this work is that fitting the corrected fluence distribution of grbs with the jet - model is well possible .",
    "the fit allows strong constraints of the star formation rate as a function of redshift .",
