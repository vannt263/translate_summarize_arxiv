    "low energy hadronic parity violation is of current interest both because of recent theoretical developments and because of the many and varied experiments underway or proposed to study the problem @xcite . in particular ,",
    "parity violation in the two nucleon sector remains an open problem . in a previous paper @xcite we addressed the parity violating asymmetries in @xmath3 scattering .",
    "here we consider processes involving photons , in particular polarized and unpolarized radiative neutron capture on protons .",
    "experiments to measure asymmetries in @xmath4 are difficult , but are important enough that the experimental community continues to push for better limits . with new results expected in the next several years ,",
    "it is timely to revisit the theoretical problem .",
    "the parity - violating ( pv ) component of hadronic interactions is caused by weak interactions of quarks contained in the hadrons .",
    "because of the relative strength of the weak interaction , its manifestation is highly suppressed compared to the strong interaction .",
    "therefore , we consider observables that would be zero without the presence of parity - violating effects .",
    "the reaction @xmath5 , with suitable polarizations of the neutron or photon , allows access to two different asymmetries : the photon asymmetry @xmath6 in polarized neutron capture , @xmath7 , and the circular photon polarization @xmath8 in unpolarized capture , @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , due to the difficulty of measuring final state photon circular polarization , the inverse reaction of deuteron photo - disintegration @xmath10 may be more experimentally feasible .",
    "the asymmetry from this inverse reaction is equal to @xmath8 for exactly reversed kinematics .",
    "weak interactions are well understood in the context of the standard model , but we are interested here in weak manifestations in hadrons at energies where qcd is not perturbative .",
    "therefore , we turn to effective field theories ( efts ) that allow for a perturbative treatment in quantities other than the strong coupling constant . while it is true that investigating hadronic parity violation necessarily involves complications from nonperturbative qcd , this fact can be used as an opportunity for probing nonperturbative qcd phenomena in hadrons . with nucleons , photons , and the deuteron as physical degrees of freedom",
    "we form the set of leading - order operators that obey the symmetries of qcd , but allow for parity violation . because the processes we are interested in occur at energies well below where the pion is dynamical",
    ", we use an eft in which the pion is integrated out , , and its physics is encoded in low energy constants ( lecs ) .    traditionally , hadronic parity violation has been studied using either the so - called danilov amplitudes @xcite or one - boson - exchange models @xcite . while the one - boson - exchange models , in particular the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , have been the standard for analyzing experiments , some possible inconsistencies have emerged ( see e.g.  fig .  5 in ref .",
    "the effective field theory treatment of parity - violating hadronic interactions as performed in this paper allows for a systematic and model - independent study of few - body low - energy phenomena .",
    "as can be seen from the lagrangian in the following section , the approach is more closely related to the danilov amplitudes than the boson - exchange models .",
    "the use of efts to study parity violation goes back more than a decade ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , with a comprehensive formulation of both pionless and pionful theories given in ref .",
    "the asymmetry from @xmath11 has been calculated previously in an eft that included pions @xcite and using the dibaryon formalism @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we reiterate the five independent pv operators that occur at leading order in .",
    "one contributes to the @xmath12 process and three to @xmath13 .",
    "other linear combinations are accessible through asymmetries in @xmath3 scattering . however , the power counting in the @xmath14 system is still an open question for some observables .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath14 scattering lengths @xmath15 are anomalously large , and that it is necessary to resum a polynomial series in @xmath15 .",
    "it is less clear how to treat the @xmath14 effective range @xmath16 .",
    "for some processes , particularly those involving the deuteron , a much improved description of data is found by by treating @xmath16 as large , or resumming the series in @xmath16 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , motivated in part by results in ref .",
    "but that may not be true for all processes .",
    "therefore , in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] , we present calculations of @xmath6 and @xmath8 both in the non - dibaryon formalism , where @xmath16 is considered to be of `` natural '' size and terms involving @xmath16 are treated as higher order , as well as in the dibaryon formalism , where @xmath16 is treated as anomalously large and the resummed nucleon bubbles are encoded into a dynamical `` dibaryon '' field .",
    "stating our results in both languages will provide the flexibility of developing a common language with other calculations done with more nucleons and/or using the non - dibaryon formalism . in the dibaryon formalism from shin , ando , and hyun @xcite . ]",
    "due to the difficulties inherent in measuring parity violation in the @xmath14 system , information on @xmath17 and @xmath8 is sparse .",
    "currently the asymmetry @xmath6 from @xmath18 is consistent with zero @xcite , but an ongoing experimental effort is expected to improve the current value @xcite .",
    "results for the photon polarization @xmath8 from @xmath19 are also consistent with zero @xcite . as discussed above , the asymmetry from the inverse reaction is equal to @xmath8 ( for suitable kinematics ) and , while current results are again consistent with zero @xcite , there has been recent interest in performing this measurement @xcite .",
    "in  nucleons interact through contact interactions . the leading order operators contain the minimum number of necessary derivatives .",
    "the parity - conserving ( pc ) lagrangian is given by @xmath20 with the normalized projection operators @xcite @xmath21 the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are su(2 ) pauli matrices in spin and isospin space , respectively , @xmath24 is the nucleon covariant derivative , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the isoscalar and isovector nucleon magnetic moments .",

    "since the following calculations contain a deuteron in the final state one has to choose an interpolating field for the deuteron .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and use @xmath37 .    for the leading - order pv lagrangian",

    "( note , however , the different placement of the gauged derivative from the ungauged derivatives in the operators given in ref .  @xcite .",

    "this leads to ( suppressing channel subscripts ) @xmath47 note that these procedures only fix the magnitude of @xmath48 and not its sign .",
    "since the dibaryon-@xmath14 couplings are of leading order , insertions of nucleon loops in the dibaryon propagator are not suppressed .",
