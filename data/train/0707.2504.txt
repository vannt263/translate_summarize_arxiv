    "a study on the heavy - to - light exclusive processes plays a complementary role in determination of the fundamental parameters of the standard model and in developing the qcd theory .",
    "and there is an increasing demand for more reliable qcd calculations of the heavy - to - light form factors .",
    "we have done a consistent analysis of the @xmath11 transition form factor in refs.@xcite , which shows that the results from the pqcd approach , the lattice qcd approach and the qcd light cone sum rules ( lcsrs ) are complementary to each other and by combining the results of those three approaches , one can obtain an understanding of the @xmath11 transition form factor in the whole physical regions .",
    "it is argued that by applying the @xmath0 factorization approach @xcite , where the transverse momentum dependence for both the hard scattering part and the non - perturbative wavefunction , the sudakov effects and the threshold effects are included , one can regulate the endpoint singularity from the hard scattering part effectively and derive a more reliable pqcd result of the b - meson decays .",
    "furthermore , by applying the b - meson wave functions up to next - to - leading fock state , ref.@xcite calculated the @xmath11 transition form factor up to @xmath12 and also made some discussions on the reasonable regions for the two phenomenological b - meson wave function parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath13 is the effective mass of b meson that determines the b - meson s leading fock state behavior and @xmath14 is a typical parameter that determines the broadness of the b - meson transverse distribution .",
    "since both pion and kaon are pseudo - scalar mesons , it will be interesting to give a consistent pqcd analysis of the @xmath15 transition form factor up to order @xmath16 based on the results of @xmath11 transition form factor .    in the literature ,",
    "the @xmath1 transition form factor has been studied under several approaches @xcite .",
    "a pqcd calculation has been done in ref.@xcite , which can be roughly treated as a leading - order estimation @xmath17 since some of the power suppressed terms both in the hard scattering amplitude and the b - meson wave function have been neglected .",
    "the @xmath1 transition form factor has also been analyzed by several groups under the qcd lcsr approach @xcite , where some extra treatments to the correlation function either from the b - meson side or from the kaonic side are adopted to improve their lcsr estimations .",
    "new sum rule for the @xmath1 form factor is derived by expanding the correlation function near the light cone in terms of b - meson distributions @xcite , in which the contributions of the quark - antiquark and quark - antiquark - gluon components in the b - meson are taken into account . while in ref.@xcite an improved lcsr approach that had been raised in ref.@xcite was adopted to eliminate the contributions from the most uncertain kaonic twist-3 wave functions and to enhance the reliability of sum rule calculations of the @xmath18 form factor .",
    "a systematic qcd lcsr calculation has been done in ref.@xcite by including the one - loop radiative corrections to the kaonic twist-2 and twist-3 contributions , and the kaonic leading - order twist-4 corrections .",
    "it can be found that the main uncertainties in estimation of the @xmath1 transition form factor come from the b - meson wave function and the kaonic twist-2 and twist-3 wave functions .    in doing the pqcd calculations on the b - meson decays ,",
    "an important issue is whether we need to take both the two wavefunctions @xmath3 and @xmath4 into consideration or simply @xmath3 is enough ? by taking the frequently used first type definition of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are defined in ref.@xcite , it can be found that @xcite their distribution amplitudes have quite different endpoint behaviors even under the wandzura - wilczek ( ww ) approximation @xcite , such difference may be strongly enhanced by the hard scattering kernel .",
    "for example , the ratio between the contributions of @xmath4 and @xmath3 is about @xmath22 @xcite for the @xmath11 from factor in the large recoil regions .",
    "so the contribution from @xmath4 under the above definition can not be neglected and it is needed to suppress the big contribution coming from @xmath3 so as to obtain a reasonable total contributions . to derive more accurate estimation , ref.@xcite raised the second type definition of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , under which the contribution from @xmath4 is of order @xmath25 to that of @xmath3 @xcite . for convenience , in the following",
    ", we shall adopt the second type definition of @xmath3 and @xmath4 to do our calculation .",
    "then one may ask is it enough to give a @xmath16 estimation with @xmath3 and @xmath4 under the ww approximation ?",
    "as has been pointed out in ref.@xcite , the 3-particle fock states contributions to the b - meson wave function can be estimated by attaching an extra gluon to the internal off - shell quark line , and then @xmath26 power suppression is induced in comparison to that of the ww - part b - meson wave functions .",
    "recently , the b - meson light - cone wave functions have been investigated up to next - to - leading order in fock state expansion in the heavy quark limit @xcite .",
    "it was shown that by using the relations between 2- and 3- particle wave functions derived from the qcd equations of motion and the heavy - quark symmetry , one can give a constraint on the transverse momentum dependence of the b - meson wave function , whose distribution tends to be a hyperbola - like curve other than a simple delta function that is derived under the ww approximation .",
    "these results provide us a chance to give a consistent pqcd analysis of the @xmath1 form factor up to order @xmath16 .",
    "another issue we need to be more careful is about the kaonic wave functions .",
    "the distribution amplitude ( da ) for the twist-2 wave function @xmath27 has been deeply studied , e.g. by the light - front quark model @xcite , the lcsr approach @xcite and the lattice calculation @xcite and etc . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the qcd sum rule for the diagonal correlation function of local and nonlocal axial - vector currents is used , in which the contributions of condensates up to dimension six and the @xmath28-corrections to the quark - condensate term are taken into account .",
    "the first gegenbauer moment @xmath29 of the twist-2 da derived there , i.e. @xmath30 , is consistent with that of the lattice calculations @xcite , so we shall constrain @xmath29 within this range when constructing a model for @xmath27 . as for the twist-3 wave function @xmath8 , the calculations of it has more uncertainty than that for the leading twist , e.g. its da moments in refs.@xcite are quite different from each other , where the da moments in refs.@xcite are derived by using the qcd light - cone sum rules and the moments in ref.@xcite are derived based on the effective chiral action from the instanton . under the pqcd approach , according to our experience on the @xmath11 transition form factor @xcite and the pion electro - magnetic form factor @xcite , it can be found that for a twist-3 wave function with a better endpoint behavior other than the asymptotic one , the twist-3 s contributions are indeed power suppressed to the leading twist s contribution that favor the conventional power counting rules . in the present paper",
    ", we shall adopt two groups of da moments @xcite together with the brodsky - huang - lepage ( bhl ) prescription  @xcite to construct a model for @xmath8 , and then make a discussion on its uncertainty to the @xmath1 transition form factor .",
    "the @xmath7-breaking effects shall also be included for constructing the kaonic wave functions .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to reexamine the @xmath1 transition form factor in the pqcd @xmath0 factorization approach up to @xmath31 . under the @xmath0 factorization approach , the full transverse momentum dependence ( @xmath0-dependence ) for both the hard scattering part and the non - perturbative wave function ,",
    "the sudakov effects and the threshold effects are included to cure the endpoint singularity .",
    "furthermore , we shall analyze the power suppressed contributions from both the wave functions and the hard scattering amplitude and then give a consistent analysis of the form factor up to @xmath16 , which have not been considered in the literature .",
    "in section ii , we give the calculated technology for the form factor in the large recoil regions .",
    "also we present the model wave functions of the kaon with better endpoint behavior in the same section , which are constructed based on the bhl prescription  @xcite and the da moments obtained in ref.@xcite . in section iii",
    ", we give our numerical results .",
    "conclusion and a brief summary are presented in the final section .",
    "the @xmath1 transition form factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined as follows : @xmath34 f_+^{b\\to k}(q^2)+   \\frac{m_b^2-m_k^2}{q^2 } q_{\\mu}f_0^{b\\to k}(q^2)\\ ] ] where @xmath35 should be equal to @xmath36 so as to cancel the poles at @xmath37 .",
    "the amplitude for the @xmath1 transition form factor can be factorized into the convolution of the wave functions for the respective hadrons with the hard - scattering amplitude . in the large recoil regions ,",
    "the @xmath1 transition form factor is dominated by a single gluon exchange in the lowest order . in ref.@xcite , we have done a consistent analysis of the @xmath11 transition form factor within the @xmath0 factorization approach , where the power suppressed terms up to @xmath16 have been kept explicitly in the hard scattering amplitude .",
    "the interesting reader may refer to ref.@xcite for more details . should be changed to @xmath38 , in eq.(5 ) the factor @xmath39 $ ]",
    "should be changed to @xmath40 $ ] and in eq.(7 ) @xmath41 should be changed to @xmath42 . ] more specifically , for the present case , one needs to know the momentum projection for the matrix element of the kaon and b meson in deriving the hard scattering amplitude . by keeping the transverse momentum dependence in the wave function",
    ", the momentum projection for the matrix element of the kaon has the following form , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the kaon decay constant and @xmath45 is the phenominological parameter @xmath46 , which is a scale characterized by the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "@xmath47 is the twist-2 wave function , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are twist-3 wave functions , respectively .",
    "@xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are two null vectors that point to the plus and the minus directions , respectively . and the momentum projection for the matrix element of the b meson can be written as @xcite : @xmath53 \\gamma_5\\right\\}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the momentum fraction for the light spectator quark in the b meson and @xmath55 .",
    "the four - component @xmath56 in eq.([projectorb ] ) is defined through , @xmath57 with @xmath58 . by including the sudakov form factors and the threshold resummation effects , one can obtain the formulae for the @xmath1 transition form factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the transverse configuration @xmath59-space , which can be simply obtained from ref.@xcite by changing the pion wave functions to the present case of kaon and by changing @xmath3 and @xmath4 to the second type definition as described in the introduction .    in pqcd approach ,",
    "the parton transverse momenta @xmath60 are not negligible around the endpoint region .",
    "the relevant sudakov factors from both @xmath61 and the threshold resummation @xcite can cure the endpoint singularity which makes the calculation of the hard amplitudes infrared safe , and then the main contribution comes from the perturbative region . also it is necessary to keep the transverse momentum dependence in the wave functions to derive a more reliable estimation in pqcd . in principle , the bethe - salpeter formalism  @xcite and the discretized light cone quantization approach  @xcite could determine the hadronic wave functions , but in practice there are many difficulties in getting the exact wave functions at present .",
    "the bhl prescription @xcite , which connects the equal - time wave function in the rest frame and the wave function in the infinite momentum frame , provides a useful way to use the approximate bound state solution of a hadron in terms of the quark model as the starting point for modeling the hadronic wave function .",
    "so in the present paper , we will adopt the bhl prescription for constructing the kaonic wave functions .",
    "while for the @xmath6-meson wave function , they have been investigated up to next - to - leading order in fock state expansion in the heavy quark limit in ref.@xcite , which shall be adopted to do our discussions .",
    "a simple model has been raised in ref.@xcite for the b - meson wave functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which keep the main features caused by the 3-particle fock states and whose transverse momentum dependence are still the like - function of the off - shell energy of the valence quarks but shall broaden the transverse momentum dependence under the ww approximation to a certain degree . and in the compact parameter @xmath64-space , it reads @xcite @xmath65 j_{\\delta-1 } [ \\kappa ] + ( 1-\\delta)\\gamma[2-\\delta ] j_{1-\\delta}[\\kappa]\\big)\\left ( \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\right)^{1-\\delta}\\ ] ] and @xmath66 j_{\\delta-1 } [ \\kappa ] + ( 1-\\delta)\\gamma[2-\\delta ] j_{1-\\delta}[\\kappa]\\big)\\left ( \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\right)^{1-\\delta } , \\label{newmodel2}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the factor @xmath70 is introduced to ensure their fourier transformation , i.e. @xmath71 , satisfy the normalization , @xmath72 .",
    "it can be found that both @xmath62 and @xmath63 have the same transverse momentum dependence and only two phenomenological parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are introduced .",
    "@xmath13 is the effective mass of b meson , @xmath73 , which determines the b meson s leading fock state behavior .",
    "@xmath14 is a typical parameter that determines the broadness of the b - meson transverse distribution in comparison to the ww - like one .",
    "the ww - like b - meson wave functions in the compact parameter @xmath64-space can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "and a direct comparison shows that when @xmath74 , the transverse momentum dependence of the b - meson wave function in eqs.([newmodel1],[newmodel2 ] ) returns to a simple @xmath14-function , which is the same as that of the b - meson wave function under the wandzura - wilczek approximation @xcite . according to the definitions , we have @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "next , we construct the kaonic twist-2 wave function based on its first gegenbauer moment @xmath78 and on the bhl prescription @xcite . the first gegenbauer moment @xmath78 has been studied by the light - front quark model @xcite , the lcsr approach @xcite and the lattice calculation @xcite and etc . in ref.@xcite ,",

    "one may observe that the contribution from @xmath8 is comparable to that of @xmath27 , e.g. its contribution is about @xmath215 of that of @xmath27 at @xmath216 , and the contribution from @xmath145 is small .",
    "fig.([kaonwave]b ) presents the contributions from @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath213 respectively .",

    "so as to the leading order estimation @xmath17 , the contribution from @xmath4 is usually neglected in the literature .",
    "such difference of @xmath4 s contribution between the leading order estimation and the next - to - leading order estimation is mainly due to the fact that the transverse momentum dependence of the b - meson wave functions are merely a delta function under the ww - approximation ( the leading - order estimation ) , while it shall be broadened to a certain degree according to the value of @xmath14 by taking into account the 3-particle fock states contributions ( the next - to - leading order estimation ) , cf .",
    "fig.(2 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "so qualitatively , the contributions from @xmath220 shall be raised to a certain degree for the next - to - leading order case , due to the less suppression of the end - point region ( @xmath221 ) from the transverse momentum distributions than that of the leading order case .",
    "and then the naive order estimation for the contribution of @xmath4 is no longer correct , and the contributions from @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both important in the next - to - leading order calculation .",
    "the ww - like b - meson wave functions in the compact parameter @xmath64-space can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "taking the ww - like wave functions and cutting off the power suppressed terms in the hard scattering amplitude , we can obtain the leading order results ( @xmath17 ) for the form factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "strictly , one should cut off the contribution from @xmath4 to obtain the leading order estimation , since @xmath4 is power suppressed in comparison to @xmath3 .",
    "however for easy comparison with the results in the literature , e.g. ref.@xcite , we keep @xmath4 in the leading order estimation . for convenience , we take @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath165 and by using the group 1 parameters for the wave function @xmath8 to do a comparison of the leading order results with the total results that include the contributions up to order @xmath16 . it can be found that the leading order results are smaller than the total results by about @xmath222 in the large recoil region , e.g. at @xmath37 , the leading order @xmath223 .",
    "one may observe that a larger leading order estimation has been obtained in ref.@xcite , which shows @xmath224 .",
    "we argue that the present leading order estimation is more reliable , and the larger value of @xmath225 derived in ref.@xcite is mainly due to the following two reasons : 1 ) even though the sudakov and threshold resummation factors shall kill the endpoint singularity of the process @xcite , the transverse momentum dependence of kaonic wave functions are still important to give a more reliable pqcd estimation , which is similar to the cases of @xmath226 form factor @xcite and the pion electromagnetic form factor @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of kaonic wave functions are lacking , i.e. the distribution amplitude other than the wave function is used . while in our present calculation , the bhl - prescription is adopted for the kaonic transverse momentum dependence . as for the wave function @xmath227 , such transverse momentum dependence will results in a double humped da @xmath140 as shown in fig.([daphip ] ) and then it shall give more effective suppression in the end - point region than the one used in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , it can be found that the contributions from the end point region shall always be overestimated without taking the transverse momentum into the twist-3 wave function @xmath227 .",
    "can be found in ref.@xcite . ] furthermore , by taking proper transverse momentum dependence for the wave function @xmath8 , the uncertainties from its distribution amplitude @xmath140 can be reduced as has been discussed in sec.iii.a ; 2 ) the distribution amplitude of @xmath27 with a much bigger value of @xmath228 , i.e. @xmath229 , is adopted by ref.@xcite . since the form factors increases with the increment of @xmath29 , a larger value of @xmath228 shall increase the form factors .",
    "furthermore , by varying @xmath13 within the region of @xmath230 $ ] , the uncertainty caused by @xmath13 is the biggest and is of order @xmath26 .",
    "while by varying @xmath14 within the region of @xmath157 $ ] , the uncertainty caused by @xmath14 is smaller and are of order @xmath231 .",
    "this can be qualitatively explained as that @xmath13 is the characteristic parameter that determines the leading fock - state behavior of the @xmath6-meson wave functions , while @xmath14 is the characteristic parameter that determines the higher fock - state s behavior of the @xmath6-meson wave functions .",
    "the uncertainties from @xmath91 and @xmath27 are less than @xmath232 in the large recoil region .",
    "the @xmath1 transition form factor have been analyzed by several groups under the qcd lcsr approach @xcite .",
    "new sum rule for @xmath1 is derived from the correlation functions expanded near the light cone in terms of b - meson distributions @xcite , in which the contributions of the quark - antiquark and quark - antiquark - gluon components in the b - meson are taken into account .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath1 transition form factor in the large recoil region does not receive contributions from the 3-particle b - meson da s .",
    "one may observe that if substituting the b - meson das , which are derived by doing the integration over @xmath64 in eqs.([newmodel1],[newmodel2 ] ) , into the formulae of ref.@xcite , then one can obtain the same results as that of ref.@xcite , since our b - meson das are close to the exponential model wave functions adopted in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , one may observe that the result of @xmath233 under the condition of @xmath234 agrees well with our present pqcd estimation .",
    "secondly , a systematic qcd lcsr calculation has been done in ref.@xcite by including the one - loop radiative corrections to the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions , and leading - order twist-4 corrections .",
    "some comparison of their results with our present one can be found in figs.([lambda],[delta],[a1k ] ) , which also shows a good agreement within reasonable errors .",
    "for example , from eq.([sumruleapp ] ) it can be found that the uncertainty of form factor caused by @xmath29 within the region of @xmath112 $ ] is less than @xmath235 , which is consistent with our present result as shown in fig.([a1k ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the @xmath1 transition form factor in the pqcd approach up to order @xmath16 , where the transverse momentum dependence for the wave function , the sudakov effects and the threshold effects are included to regulate the endpoint singularity and to derive a more reasonable result .",
    "we have confirmed that the pqcd approach can be applied to calculate the @xmath1 transition form factor in the large recoil regions .",
    "we emphasize that the transverse momentum dependence for both the b meson and the kaon is important to give a better understanding of the @xmath1 transition form factor .",
    "fig.([kaonwave]a ) shows that the contribution from the pionic twist-3 wave function @xmath8 is sizable in comparison to that of @xmath27 , and the contribution from @xmath145 is small .",
    "while fig.([kaonwave]b ) shows that by using the b - meson wave functions up to next - to - leading order fock state expansion , the contributions from @xmath3 and @xmath4 are important .    in refs.@xcite , we have shown that the results from the pqcd approach , the lattice qcd approach and the qcd lcsrs are complementary to each other and by combining the results of those three approaches , one can obtain an understanding of the @xmath11 transition form factor in the whole physical regions . and the best fit of the pqcd results with that of the qcd lcsr results in the large recoil region can be obtained by taking @xmath236 $ ] and @xmath160 $ ] @xcite . in the present paper , we show that within the regions of @xmath237 $ ] , @xmath160 $ ] and @xmath238 $ ] , the pqcd results on the @xmath1 form factor in the large recoil region also agree well with that of the qcd lcsr results @xcite .",
    "our present pqcd results in some sense is more reliable than the lcsr calculations due to the fact that by taking the transverse momentum dependence properly for the wave functions the soft endpoint singularity have been effectively suppressed , e.g. as is shown in sec.iii.a the difference between the two models for @xmath8 is less than @xmath211 in the large recoil region , while for the lcsr approach large uncertainty comes from the kaonic twist-3",
    "da @xmath140 that is not too well - known . by running the parameters within the above regions , we obtain @xmath9 .",
    "finally , to illustrate the @xmath7-breaking effects , we calculated the ratio with the help of the @xmath226 results in ref.@xcite : @xmath239=1.13\\pm0.02 $ ] , which favors a small @xmath7-breaking effects .",
