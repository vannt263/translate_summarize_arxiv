    "the @xmath43-based m@xmath8  estimates show almost consistent results to vp06 with a slight offset of @xmath64 , which is expected from a difference in the adopted values of the virial factor ( i.e. , @xmath27 here versus @xmath65 in vp06 ) .",
    "in contrast , the comparison of fwhm@xmath42-based masses , respectively estimated with our recipe and with that of vp06 , shows large scatter and a systematic trend that the vp06 recipe underestimates m@xmath8  in the low - mass regime and overestimates m@xmath8  in the high - mass regime , compared to our recipe .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : comapre_vp06_sl12 ] shows that the sl12 recipe systematically overestimates m@xmath8  over the whole dynamic range of the sample ( i.e. , @xmath66 @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is understandable because sl12 used the fwhm@xmath68-based m@xmath8  in vp06 as a fiducial one and recalibrate the estimator using their high - mass ( @xmath69 @xmath67 ) qsos .",
    "thus , the calibration performed by sl12 in their limited dynamical range inherits the overestimation behavior of the vp06 recipe with respect to our recipe , and propagates it into the low mass regime with larger effect .",

    "it is interesting to see the consistency of the @xmath38-based calibration between our study and vp06 , despite the systematic bias in @xmath40 measurements of vp06 as shown in section  [ compare_vp06 ] .",
    "we interpret this as follows .",
    "although there is a bias in the vp06 measurement method for @xmath38 , due to their choice of line limits ( i.e. , @xmath41 km  s@xmath30 ) , their @xmath38-based m@xmath8  measurements serendipitously scatter evenly below and above the central point of the mass scale of the sample , consequently resulting in a similar zero point regardless of the bias in @xmath38 measurements . in the end",
    "the calibrations are very similar , however , the intrinsic scatter of our calibration is smaller than that of vp06 , which demonstrates a general increase in accuracy of our @xmath38-based masses over those of vp06 , advocating for our @xmath38 measurement prescription .          to demonstrate the effect of our new estimators on m@xmath8  studies , we present in figure  [ fig : sdss_dr7_quasar ] the m@xmath8  distribution of the sdss qso sample as a function of redshift , based on various mass estimators .",
    "these masses are calculated using the fwhm@xmath42 measurements from shen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who provides only fwhm measurements using sdss dr7 spectra .",
    "note that fwhm@xmath42-based m@xmath8  determined with our new estimator is on average smaller by @xmath73 dex than that calculated with the previous estimator by vp06 , since the vp06 recipe tends to overestimate m@xmath8  in the high - mass regime as explained in section 4.2 .",
    "in contrast , there is a smooth transition between -based masses estimated from the recipe of wang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and -based masses from our new calibration since both estimators are based on the same calibration scheme ( see section [ sec : calibration ] ) .",
    "kelly & shen ( 2013 ) derived a predicted maximum m@xmath8  of broad - line qsos as a function of redshift ( their figure 7 ) , showing a slight trend that the maximum m@xmath8  was larger at higher redshift .",
    "however , this subtle trend may simply be a result of systematic overestimation of  masses at high redshift because their mass determination was based on the vp06 recipe .",
    "adopting our new  mass estimator may eliminate such a trend .",
    "we investigated the calibration of  m@xmath8  estimators based on the updated sample of @xmath26 agns , for which both h@xmath4  reverberation masses and uv archival spectra were available .",
    "the sample of agns with rm masses as well as the uv spectra including  have been expanded and updated since the calibrations performed by vp06 ; it is therefore useful to revisit the calibration of the -based mass estimators to provide the most consistent virial m@xmath8  estimates using the  emission line .",
    "major differences of the calibration method between vp06 and the current study is twofold .",
    "first , we derived line widths ( i.e. , line dispersion and fwhm ) from the spectral fits by performing multi - component fitting on the  complex region to accurately de - blend  from other contaminating lines while vp06 measured the line width of civ directly from the spectra . when `` applying '' a se scaling relationship to calculate m@xmath8 , it is important to use the same fitting and line width measurement prescriptions that were used in `` calibrating '' the scaling relationship because significant systematic differences can arise in m@xmath8estimates if different analysis and measurement techniques are utilized ( e.g. , assef et al .",
    "2011 , denney 2012 , sl12 , park et al .",
    "second , we treated the slope parameters ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath50 ) in the virial m@xmath8  equation ( i.e. , eq .",
    "[ eq : calibration ] ) as free parameters as in wang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which is particularly important for fwhm .",
    "we provided the best - fit calibrations for both @xmath43- and fwhm@xmath42-based mass estimators .",
    "while we presented a consistent estimator for the @xmath38-based masses to that of vp06 , we obtained significantly different m@xmath8  estimator for the fwhm - based masses , presumably due to relaxing the constraint of the virial expectation ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) to mitigate the fwhm - dependent biases .",
    "we generally recommend to use the @xmath38-based mass  estimator if the @xmath38 measurement is available , as it shows the better consistency with the virial relation , and @xmath38-based masses show a smaller scatter than the fwhm - based masses when compared to h@xmath4  rm - based masses . using @xmath43-based estimator",
    "is also preferred by denney ( 2012 ) , who showed that the @xmath43 measured from mean spectra is the better tracer of the broad - line velocity field than the fwhm@xmath42 since fwhm of  is much more affected by the non - variable  core component .    compared to the previously calibrated fwhm@xmath42 estimator by vp06 , our new estimator shows a systematic trend as a function of mass .",
    "the vp06 recipe overestimates m@xmath8  in the high - mass regime ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) while it underestimate m@xmath8  in the low - mass regime ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) , compared to  masses based on our new estimator .",
    "this systematic discrepancy is due to a combination of effects , including difference in the rm sample and updated rm masses , newly available uv spectra , emission - line fitting method , and calibration method . for the sdss quasar sample ( shen et al .",
    "2011 ) , we find that m@xmath8  estimates based on our new estimator are systematically smaller by @xmath73 dex than those based on the previous recipe of vp06 .",
    "one of the main differences in calibrating the fwhm@xmath42-based mass estimator is that we fit the exponent of velocity ( @xmath77 ) as in eq .",
    "3 , instead of adopting @xmath78 as in vp06 .",
    "this provides effectively the same effect as adopting a varying virial factor .",
    "if a constant virial factor is used for mass determination , then fwhm - based masses will show systematic difference compared to @xmath38-based masses , since the fwhm/@xmath38 ratio has a broad distribution , while the fiducial rm masses are derived with @xmath38 measurements from rms spectra . to resolve this issue , collin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , for example , introduced varying virial factors for the fwhm@xmath68-based mass estimator depending on the range of the line widths . in our case , relaxing the virial ( fwhm@xmath79 ) requirement in calibrating fwhm@xmath42-based masses against @xmath80-based rm masses provides virtually the same effect as adopting a varying virial factor , thus resulting in better consistency with @xmath38-based masses .",
    "it also mitigates the bias caused by the contamination of the non - variable  emission component , where fwhm@xmath42-based masses in objects with peaky ( boxy ) profiles are under- ( over- ) estimated with previous fwhm@xmath42-based mass estimators .",
    "the calibration of mass estimators provided in this study still suffers from a sample bias as in the case of vp06 .",
    "the incompleteness or lack of low - mass objects ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) in the current sample will be resolved when new _ hst _  stis observations become available for six low - mass reverberation - mapped agns ( go-12922 , pi : woo ) .",
    "however , the extrapolation of this calibration to high - luminosity , higher - redshift agns more similar to the sdss sample can only be realized with the extension of the rm sample to this regime  an endeavor that we strongly advocate .",
    "apart from the calibration analysis performed in this and previous studies , several schemes to correct for the -based masses have been suggested in the literature to reduce the large scatter between the -based masses and the h@xmath4-based masses .",
    "for example , assef et al . (",
    "2011 ) suggested a prescription to reduce mass residuals using the ratio of the rest - frame uv to optical continuum luminosities based on a sample of 12 lensed quasars .",
    "shen & liu ( 2012 ) reported a poor correlation with large scatter between fwhm@xmath68 and fwhm@xmath1 using a sample of 60 high - luminosity qsos , showing that some part of the scatter correlated with the blueshift of  with respect to h@xmath4 .",
    "they suggested a correction for the fwhm of  and ] lines as a function of the  blueshift .",
    "recently , denney ( 2012 ) showed that the  line profile consists of both non - variable and variable components based on the sample of seven agns with  reverberation data , and concluded that this non - variable component is a main source of the large scatter of the  se m@xmath8 .",
    "they provided an empirical correction for the fwhm - based mass depending on the line shape as parameterized as the ratio of fwhm to the line dispersion .",
    "since the  line region is more likely to be affected by non - virial motions such as outflows and winds than the lower ionization line region , such as h@xmath4  ( e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2008 ; richards et al . 2011 ) , aforementioned corrections are also important and worth investigating further with a larger sample with enlarged dynamic range .    in general , correcting for possible systematic biases and providing accurate m@xmath8  estimates is crucial for studies of the cosmic evolution of bh population , particularly at high - redshifts ( e.g. , fine et al .",
    "2006 ; shen et al .",
    "2008 , 2011 , shen & kelly 2012 ; kelly & shen 2013 ) .",
    "thus , it is important to ensure a reliable calibration at the high - mass end ( @xmath82 @xmath67 ) since the  mass estimators are most applicable to high - mass agns at high - redshift utilizing optical spectroscopic data from large agn surveys .",
    "note that the current rm sample used for calibrating  mass estimators still suffers from the lack of high - luminosity agns , suggesting that the rm sample may not best represent the high - luminosity qsos at high - redshifts , i.e. , sdss qsos .",
    "thus , obtaining direct  reverberation mapping results for high - mass qsos will be even more useful ( see kaspi et al .",
    "2007 for tentative results ) , despite the practical observational challenges .",
    "such measurements will be used to better determine a reliable  size - luminosity relation and to directly investigate non - varying component of .",
