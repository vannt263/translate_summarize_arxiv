    "break junction experiments have allowed to perform transport studies on nanoscale metallic contacts in which the mean free path of the electrons is much larger than the junction length .",
    "the observation of quantized conductance in such systems is a hallmark of ballistic transport and opened new vistas to study the scaling of electronic devices down to the atomic length scale.@xcite a drawback of such experiments is the limited control of the microscopic arrangement in the junction which hinders a straight forward interpretation of the data and makes a comparison with theoretical calculations difficult.@xcite in this respect , a great advantage is given by the use of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments , in which a tip can approach and contact single atoms or molecules on a surface.@xcite in such experiments , it has been possible to measure the conductance as a function of tip - sample distance from the tunneling to the contact regime . due to the promise of spintronic devices for future applications with low power consumption and high speed ,",
    "a recent focus of such contact measurements has been magnetic systems , e.g.  spin - valve behavior has been observed in single magnetic molecules or atoms on surfaces  @xcite and the occurrence of the kondo effect has been found in ferromagnetic atomic contacts.@xcite    it has been emphasized that the low coordination of the contact atoms in nanoscale junctions leads to an enhanced tendency towards magnetism , e.g.  magnetic moments are formed in systems of otherwise non - magnetic materials.@xcite naturally , transport phenomena in such magnetic low - dimensional systems have raised a lot of attention and triggered many theoretical studies , which mainly focused on systems with collinear magnetic order , considering also the effect of magnetoresistance.@xcite it was also recently realized that , if the magnetization direction of the two electrodes is opposite , a domain wall can form in the contact between them and the non - collinear order in the domain strongly affects the conductance and the magnetoresistance.@xcite finally , the effect of spin - orbit coupling on the conductance needs to be considered@xcite which leads to novel transport phenomena such as the ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance@xcite or the tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance.@xcite    recently , the transition regime from tunneling to contact in a spin - polarized stm geometry has been studied based on density functional theory in order to explain e.g.  the conductance of a single magnetic atom,@xcite and to analyze the contribution from different conduction channels.@xcite as a magnetic stm tip approaches a single magnetic atom on a surface an exchange interaction with the tip apex atom occurs . in principle , it is possible to switch the magnetic moment of the adatom in such a way.@xcite if the magnetic moment of the adatom is exchange coupled to the substrate ( as in ref .  ) there is a competition of exchange interactions which can result in a canting of the spins close to contact .",
    "non - collinear spin alignment in such an atomic contact can also occur if the adatom spin is canted due to exchange coupling on a substrate with a spin spiral structure as in refs .   and .",
    "the effect of such a non - collinearity in the spin direction of the tip apex and the adatom on the conductance is the focus of the present work .",
    "we introduce an approach to calculate the conductance in magnetic nanojunctions with non - collinear spin structure from first - principles , employing the methodology of non - collinear wannier functions ( wfs ) , which we describe in detail . in order to start from an accurate description of the electronic and magnetic structure of the system we use the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method based on density functional theory .",
    "we map the electronic structure of a system in a non - collinear magnetic state from the flapw description to a tight - binding like hamiltonian via wfs .",
    "finally , we calculate the conductance within the landauer approach with the technique of green s functions .    as a model system ,",
    "we consider two co monowires to each of which a single apex mn atom is attached .",
    "we vary the distance between the two mn atoms in order to calculate the conductance from the tunneling to the contact regime . the magnetization direction of the two co electrodes is chosen either parallel ( p ) or antiparallel ( ap ) which allows us to obtain the distance - dependent magnetoresistance . in the tunneling regime",
    "the conductance is dominated by states of @xmath3-@xmath4-orbital character and only in the contact regime there is an additional contribution due to @xmath8-states .",
    "as the latter conduction channel is suppressed in the ap alignment the magnetoresistance displays a large rise close to contact .",
    "when the two mn atoms approach in the p electrode alignment a competition of the exchange interactions between the two mn spins and the mn spins with the co electrodes occurs . while the mn spins couple ferromagnetically to the co electrodes , they couple antiferromagnetically with each other . as a result",
    "a non - collinear arrangement becomes the magnetic ground state and the angle between the two mn spins changes gradually from zero to about @xmath9 at the closest separation we considered .",
    "the conductance displays a characteristic dip as the non - collinear state forms which is also apparent in the distance - dependent magnetoresistance .",
    "we explain this reduction of the conductance due to non - collinear spin states from the spin - dependent hybridization of @xmath8-states between the two mn atoms which depends on the angle between their spin moments and partly suppresses the conduction in this channel .",

    "noticeably , the ldos of both atoms for the up - spin in a wide region of energies around @xmath184 is absent , leading to a negligible @xmath108-conductance . here , it is important to remark , that the ldos of the nn co atoms around the fermi energy overall resembles quite well the ldos of a co atom in a co monowire , see  e.g.  fig .",
    "13(a ) in ref .  , or even of a co atom deposited on a noble - metal surfaces , see  e.g.  ref .",
    "this means that our results should be rather stable with respect to the geometry of the co leads , manifesting that the main influence on the @xmath99 conductance at @xmath184 would come from the hybridization of the mn and nn co states .",

    "[ fig : t_vs_dos ] ) that they hybridize directly at the fermi energy , which leads to a significant @xmath99 contribution to the conductance .",
    "specifically , while the @xmath185 subband of co spreads from @xmath1141.8 to @xmath1831  ev , the @xmath99-down states of mn atoms are distinctly split into wide bonding ( `` b '' ) states at the fermi energy and narrow anti - bonding ( `` a '' ) states at @xmath1831.8  ev . very importantly for the transport properties of the system , the hybridization of the @xmath185 band of co with the @xmath185 states of mn is non - trivial .",

    "let us now follow the evolution of the electronic structure upon increasing the angle between the mn spins .",
    "two trends in the ldos can be clearly observed in fig .",

    "when mn spins are anti - parallel to each other , both types of states transform into degenerate @xmath99-orbitals of the `` isolated '' mn atoms , since the hybridization between the mn states of the same spin is almost absent due to large exchange splitting . on the other hand ,",

    "interestingly , while for @xmath189 a large value of the @xmath99-conductance is due to a significant amount of delocalized co and bonding mn states at the fermi energy in the spin - down channel , for larger angles the value of @xmath190 is due to a sharp resonant co state in the spin - up channel at the fermi energy , coupled to a bonding mn state at @xmath184 . when further increasing @xmath48 above 170@xmath169 , this resonance becomes more localized and decoupled from the states in the leads , while the mn ldos at the @xmath184 in the minority spin - channel vanishes , causing a sharp drop in the @xmath99-conductance . by looking at the total ldos of the nn co atom in the p@xmath109@xmath109-state",
    "we observe that it remains basically unaffected , as compared to the p@xmath108@xmath108-configuration , while the mn states become pronouncedly decoupled from the states of the nn co owing to the energetical mismatch for both spin channels .      finally , we investigate the evolution of the conductance and the magnetoresistance of different magnetic states of the junction within the contact regime mimicking a typical stm or break junction experiment . here , we are partly motivated by the fact that a non - trivial behavior of magnetoresistance when going from tunelling to contact has been recently observed in stm experiments , see e.g.  ref .  .",

    "small possible deviations from the collinear arrangement of the mn spins , which can affect the details of the distribution of the @xmath99-states and their coupling to the leads , would not manifest in a conductance measurement , owing to the antiparallel magnetizations of the leads , and corresponding complete dominance of the @xmath97 channel for conductance at @xmath184 in this case , fig .",
