    "amoebas have proven to be a very useful tool in several areas of mathematics , and they have many applications in real algebraic geometry , complex analysis , mirror symmetry , algebraic statistics and in several other areas ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "they degenerate to piecewise - linear objects called _ tropical varieties _ ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we can use amoebas as an intermediate link between the classical and the tropical geometry .",
    "the amoeba @xmath3 of an algebraic variety @xmath4 is a closed subset of @xmath5 , and its ( lebesgue ) volume is well - defined .",
    "passare and rullgrd @xcite proved that the area of complex plane curve amoebas is finite and the bound is given in terms of the newton polygon . in this paper , we prove that the amoeba area of any algebraic curve in @xmath6 is finite ( the area here is with respect to the induced euclidean metric of @xmath5 ) .",
    "moreover , we generalize our result , for any algebraic variety @xmath7 of dimension @xmath0 in the complex algebraic torus @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "our main result is the following theorem :    [ main theorem ] let @xmath7 be an algebraic variety of dimension @xmath0 in the complex torus @xmath8 with @xmath9 , such that no irreducible component of @xmath7 is contained in a subtorus of dimension less than @xmath10 .",
    "then , the volume of its amoeba is finite .",
    "note that if @xmath7 contains an irreducible component in an algebraic subtorus of dimension strictly less than @xmath10 , then the volume of its amoeba is infinite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review some properties of the amoebas and also the structure theorem of the logarithmic limit set defined by bergman @xcite , which is used as a tool in the proof of our results . in section 3 ,",
