    "the electron - phonon coupling strongly affects vibrational modes of nano- and micro - electro - mechanical systems .",
    "much interest have attracted the effects of this coupling related to the reduced dimensionality of the electron system , as they make it possible to reveal interesting consequences of the electron correlations at the nanoscale , the coulomb blockade being a simple example , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "much less attention has been paid to the consequences of the electron - phonon coupling , which are related to the discreteness of the vibrational spectrum of a nanosystem , but emerge in the absence of size quantization of the electron motion .",
    "one of such consequences , which we study in this paper , is the coupling - induced change of the vibration nonlinearity .",
    "strong nonlinearity is a generic feature of vibrations in small systems @xcite .",
    "its easily accessible manifestation is the dependence of the mode frequencies on the vibration amplitudes .",
    "this dependence corresponds to the  self - action \" of the mode , and its familiar analog in bulk crystals are acoustic solitons @xcite ; however , the nonlinearity required for observing such solitons usually is sufficiently strong only for high - frequency phonons .",
    "also , the change of the eigenfrequency with the mode amplitude is of interest for modes with a discrete frequency spectrum , such as standing waves in mesoscopic systems , but not for propagating waves with a quasi - continuous spectrum .    much attention",
    "have been recently attracting si - based nano- and micromechanical systems , see @xcite and references therein . in such systems",
    "there was observed an unexpectedly large change of the amplitude dependence of the vibration frequency with the varying electron density @xcite .",
    "when the doping level was increased from @xmath0  @xmath1 to @xmath2  @xmath1 , the nonlinearity parameter increased by more than an order of magnitude . moreover ,",
    "the nonlinearity change was different for the vibrational modes with different spatial structure .    in this paper",
    "we develop a theory of the nonlinearity of vibrational modes in semiconductor nano- and micro - mechanical systems with high electron density .",
    "we show that the electron - phonon coupling can lead to a strong self - action of the vibrational modes , which in turn significantly modifies the amplitude dependence of the mode frequencies .",
    "we find the dependence of the effect on the electron density and temperature .    for bulk semiconductors , the effect of the electron - phonon coupling on the elastic properties , including the three - phonon coupling ,",
    "was first analyzed by keyes @xcite .",
    "the analysis referred to @xmath3-ge and was based on the deformation potential approximation .",
    "the idea was that deformation lifts the degeneracy of the equivalent electron valleys , which leads to a redistribution of the electrons over the valleys . in turn ,",
    "such redistribution changes the speed of sound depending on the direction and polarization of the sound waves and also affects the sound speed in the presence of uniaxial stress .",
    "this theory was extended to silicon and the corresponding measurements were done by hall @xcite .",
    "however , hall also observed the change of the speed of transverse sound waves and the effect of stress on sound propagation in the geometries , where these effects are due to shear deformation and do not arise in the deformation potential model .",
    "a theory of the change of the linear shear elastic constant in silicon due to the intervalley redistribution of the electrons was developed by cerdeira and cardona @xcite .",
    "as we show , in mesoscopic systems the strain - induced redistribution of the electrons over the valleys of the conduction band leads to the previously unexplored strong fourth - order nonlinearity of the vibrational modes .",
    "this nonlinearity gives a major contribution to the amplitude dependence of the vibration frequency .",
    "the redistribution also leads to a temperature dependence of the frequencies .",
    "the magnitudes of the effects sensitively depends on the mode structure .",
    "we describe them for several types of modes , including those studied in the experiment @xcite and qualitatively compare the results with the observations .",

    "the normalization ( [ eq : normalization ] ) is convenient for the analysis of low - frequency modes with the discrete spectrum characteristic of mesoscopic systems .",
    "such modes are standing waves , and therefore vectors @xmath9 can be chosen real .",
    "the low - frequency part of the displacement can be written as @xmath10 functions @xmath11 give the mode amplitudes . in the harmonic approximation",

    "the results of this paper show that the electron - phonon coupling strongly affects the nonlinearity of vibrational modes in semiconductor - based nano- and micromechanical systems .",
    "the mechanism of the effect is the strain - induced redistribution of the electrons between the valleys of the conduction band .",
