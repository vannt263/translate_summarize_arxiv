    "many lines of evidence indicate that our solar system was contaminated during its formation by material from a nearby core - collapse supernova .",
    "isotopic analyses of meteorites reveal both evidence for the one - time presence of short - lived radionuclides ( slrs ) as well as stable element isotopic anomalies suggestive of supernova ejecta .",
    "furthermore , the sun s elemental and even its isotopic composition point to contamination from a supernova .    traditionally ,",
    "the strongest arguments for supernova contamination come from isotopic analyses of the decay products of radioactive isotopes in meteorites . by observing correlations between excesses of the daughter isotope with the elemental abundance of the parent",
    ", it is inferred that the solar nebula contained several slrs with half lives @xmath7 , including @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and most importantly , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( wadhwa et al .",
    "2007 ) . even before it was discovered , cameron ( 1962 ) suggested that the presence of @xmath10 in the early solar system would imply injection from a nearby supernova . since its discovery ( lee et al .",
    "1976 ) , alternative sources of @xmath10 have been suggested , including production by irradiation by energetic particles within the solar nebula ( lee et al .",
    "1998 ; gounelle et al .",
    "2001 , 2006 ) .",
    "these models encounter a number of difficulties , however ( desch et al .",
    "2010 ) , and an external nucleosynthetic source is usually invoked for this isotope ( huss et al .",
    "2009 ; wadhwa et al .",
    "2007 ; makide et al .  2011 ; boss 2012 ) .",
    "more recently , the existence of @xmath11 in the solar nebula at a level @xmath12 was reported by tachibana & huss ( 2003 ) .",
    "this would definitively indicate injection of material from a nearby supernova into the sun s molecular cloud or protoplanetary disk , as no other plausible sources exist for this neutron - rich isotope ( leya et al .",
    "2003 ; wadhwa et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the widespread existence of @xmath11 in the solar nebula at these levels has been called into question , although its existence at lower levels , @xmath13 appears to be robust ( telus et al .  2012 ; quitte et al .",
    "2010 ; spivak - birndorf et al .",
    "2011 ) . even at @xmath13 , the existence of @xmath11",
    "probably demands a late input from a supernova ( jacobsen 2005 ; huss et al .",
    "thus , while the evidence from meteoritic slrs is not quite as clear - cut as previously thought , the consensus view remains that @xmath11 , @xmath10 , and other slrs were injected by a supernova .",
    "furthermore , the slr measurements in meteorites also suggest this contamination occurred early in the solar system s evolution ( wadhwa et al .  2007 ;",
    "huss et al .",
    "this is because high levels of @xmath10 ( at an initial abundance @xmath14 @xmath15 ) are commonly inferred for calcium - rich , aluminum - rich inclusions ( cais ) in meteorites at the time they formed ( macpherson et al .",
    "cais are composed of minerals that condense from a solar composition gas at very high temperatures , @xmath16 ( ebel & grossman 2000 ) , meaning that they formed in a hot solar nebula .",
    "such temperatures require high mass accretion rates through the protoplanetary disk @xmath17 that can not be maintained for more than @xmath18 ( e.g. , lesniak & desch 2011 ) .",
    "this timeframe is consistent with the finding by larsen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that the initial @xmath14 ratio in cais is uniform and suggestive of @xmath10-bearing cais forming from a homogenized reservoir all within @xmath19 of each other ( makide et al .",
    "in fact , this timescale is nearly as short as the expected free - fall timescale on which material is believed to collapse from the molecular cloud , and it appears quite likely that @xmath10 was injected at some point _ during _ the collapse process ( thrane et al .",
    "2008 ; makide et al .",
    "injection and incomplete homogenization would also explain the existence of rare cais called fun inclusions ( fractionation and unknown nuclear effects ) , for which strong upper limits on initial @xmath10 exist , as low as @xmath20 ( fahey et al .",
    "1987 ) , at least for some of these objects .",
    "presumably these cais formed early , from material not yet contaminated by mixing of injected supernova material ( sahijpal & goswami 1998 ) .",
    "the weight of evidence is that injection of @xmath10-bearing supernova material happened very early in the solar system s evolution , probably in the first 1 myr .",
    "strong meteoritic evidence for supernova injection is also provided by stable isotope anomalies .",
    "variations in @xmath21 among planetary materials argue strongly for a heterogeneous distribution of this isotope within the solar nebula ( podosek et al .",
    "1997 ; rotaru et al .  1992 ; trinquier et al .",
    "the carrier of this anomaly recently has been discovered to be small ( @xmath22 ) spinel ( @xmath23 ) presolar grains with @xmath24 ratios greater than 3 ( dauphas et al .  2010 ) or more ( qin et al .",
    "2011 ; nittler et al .",
    "2012 ) times the solar value .",
    "qin et al .  ( 2011 ) argue these formed from material from the o / ne and o / c burning zones of a type ii supernova .",
    "other stable isotopes anomalies appear to correlate with @xmath21 , including @xmath25 ( regelous et al .",
    "2008 ) and @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( trinquier et al .  2009 ) , which qin et al .  ( 2011 ) argue are also consistent with an origin in the o / ne or o / c zones of a type ii supernova .",
    "interestingly , larsen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have presented evidence for heterogeneous @xmath28 anomalies ( from decay of @xmath10 ) that correlate with the @xmath21 anomalies , which would strongly imply that the source of @xmath10 in the solar nebula was associated with the nanospinels that introduced the @xmath29 in addition , ranen & jacobsen ( 2006 ) inferred late contributions from a nucleosynthetic source from variations in ba isotopes , and dauphas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) inferred the same from variations in mo isotopes .",
    "these stable isotope anomalies , manifested as differences in isotopic ratios between different planetary materials , represent ( late ) additions of material that did not mix well in the solar nebula .",
    "there are also stable isotopes which appear well mixed but manifest themselves as differences in isotopic ratios between planetary materials and the predictions of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "as emphasized by clayton ( 2003 ) , the isotopic ratios of si in meteorites and planetary materials in the solar system are difficult to reconcile with the isotopic ratios in  mainstream \" sic presolar grains .",
    "these grains seem to show greater contributions from secondary isotopes ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , relative to the primary isotope @xmath32 , than solar system materials , despite the fact that they predate the solar system and sample material that has seen less galactic chemical evolution ( clayton & timmes 1997 ; alexander & nittler 1999 ; zinner 1998 ) .",
    "contamination of the solar system by @xmath32-rich supernova material has been invoked to explain this discrepancy ( alexander & nittler 1999 ) . in a similar way , young et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have considered the oxygen isotopic composition of the solar system in a galactic context , comparing it to gas around protostars .",
    "they infer that the solar system was enriched in @xmath33 ( and / or depleted in @xmath34 ) , relative to @xmath35 , by about 30% .",
    "they also argue for mixing of material with ejecta from a core - collapse supernova .",
    "going beyond the strong evidence for supernova contamination of meteorites and planetary materials , there is growing evidence for contamination of the sun itself .",
    "recent _ genesis _ measurements of isotopic ratios in the solar wind appear to confirm that the sun s oxygen isotopic ratio matches that of cais in meteorites ( mckeegan et al .",
    "2011 ) , meaning that if the meteorites differ isotopically from the galactic average , then so does the sun . also , it has long been recognized that the sun s metallicity is anomalously high compared to g dwarfs formed at the same time and galactocentric distance ( edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ) , and it has even been suggested that the sun formed at 6.6 kpc , in order to explain its elevated [ fe / h ] ( wielen et al .",
    "an alternative explanation is that stars forming at the same place and time may receive considerably different contributions of supernova material ( reeves 1978 ) .",
    "the sun s [ fe / h ] might appear anomalously high if it received a significant amount of supernova material .",
    "a prediction of this scenario is that stars would exhibit variations in [ fe / h ] and other elemental ratios , because of the presumably stochastic nature of supernova contamination .",
    "observational support for elemental variations was sought by cunha & lambert ( 1994 ) and cunha et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who found up to a factor of 2 variations in elemental ratios in o and si but not fe , c and n among newly formed b , f and g stars of the same age and subgroup in the orion star - forming region .",
    "the variability of o and si , which are primary products of core - collapse supernovae , but not in c and n , which come predominantly from sources other than core - collapse supernovae , was taken as strong evidence for contamination from nearby supernovae .",
    "unfortunately , subsequent work has not confirmed such high degrees of variability among orion stars , ( dorazi et al .  2009",
    "; takeda et al .  2010 ; simn - diz 2010 ; nieva & simn - diz 2011 ) .",
    "intriguingly , though , among stars known by radial velocity surveys to host planets , the ratios of abundant elements like c , o , si and fe appear to vary by factors of 2 in their stellar atmospheres ( bond et al .",
    "2008 ; pagano et al .",
    "supernova injection into the molecular cloud from which protostars are forming remains a plausible mechanism for these variations , and may contribute to the abundances observed in planet - hosting stars .    in summary ,",
    "the preponderance of the evidence from studies of slrs and stable isotope anomalies in meteorites , comparisons of stable isotopic ratios in the solar system with those in presolar grains and interstellar gas , and measurements of the elemental variations of planet - hosting stars stars all point to a single scenario .",
    "supernova ejecta contaminated the sun , likely very early in the solar system s evolution , and similar contamination is likely to be a common occurrence in the formation of sun - like stars .",
    "various models have been proposed for how a newly forming solar system could be contaminated with supernova material during either in the early stages of collapse , or soon after the protoplanetary disk has formed .",
    "cameron & truran ( 1977 ) suggested that the sun s molecular cloud core was both contaminated by supernova material _ and _ simultaneously triggered by the supernova shock to collapse .",
    "increasingly sophisticated numerical models have simulated the interaction of supernova ejecta with a marginally stable molecular cloud core , showing that the ejecta simultaneously can trigger collapse of the cloud core and inject supernova material into the collapsing gas , provided the ejecta have been slowed to speeds @xmath36 ( boss 1995 ; foster & boss 1996 , 1997 ; boss & foster 1998 ; vanhala & cameron 1998 ; boss & vanhala 2000 ; vanhala & boss 2002 ; boss et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ; boss & keiser 2010 ) .",
    "this last point is crucial , since higher speeds tend to shred apart the cloud core rather than initiate its collapse .",
    "the need to slow the ejecta from initial velocities @xmath37 demands that several parsecs of gas must lie between the supernova and the cloud core .",
    "such molecular gas is observed to lie at the periphery of h ii regions in which massive stars evolve and go supernova , but the rest of the scenario is difficult to test observationally , because the cloud cores would be deeply embedded several parsecs deep within the molecular clouds .",
    "supernova injection into molecular clouds was explored in a different context by gounelle et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in their model ,",
    "multiple supernovae in a stellar cluster sequentially condense the ambient low - density interstellar gas into molecular clouds , and the ejecta material is assumed to mix into the molecular gas simultaneously . as a result of this sequential enrichment , stars of the next generation forming from these molecular clouds would contain the products of multiple supernovae .",
    "injection of supernova material into a protoplanetary disk was considered analytically by chevalier ( 2000 ) , and numerically by ouellette et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2007 , 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "these authors noted that protoplanetary disks are commonly found in high - mass star - forming regions , near massive stars that will quickly evolve off the main sequence and explode as supernovae .",
    "ouellette et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that injection of supernova material into a protoplanetary disk , at levels high enough to explain the abundances of slrs like @xmath10 , was possible , provided these species resided in large ( radii @xmath38 ) dust grains , to avoid flowing around the disk .",
    "gounelle & meibom ( 2009 ) and williams & gaidos ( 2009 ) noted that the disk is very likely to have already evolved several myr , or to be many parsecs away , at the time of the explosion , raising doubts that injection into a protoplanetary disk can explain the abundances of slrs .",
    "ouellette et al .",
    "( 2010 ) countered that a combination of triggered formation and clumpy supernova ejecta may yet satisfy the constraints , and work on this model is ongoing .",
    "an important feature of this model that may distinguish it from alternatives is that significant amounts of supernova ejecta do not enter the star , just the disk material .",
    "here we study a third alternative , based on the observation that star formation occurs in the molecular gas at the edges of h ii regions , quite probably triggered by the ionization fronts and associated shocks driven by the massive stars at the center of the h ii region ( hester et al .",
    "2004 ; hester & desch 2005 ; snider et al .",
    "supernova ejecta from the explosion of a massive star will generally occur at the center of an h ii region , and will generally contaminate this peripheral gas . if supernova ejecta could emplace themselves in the molecular gas as it collapses due to compression either from a d - type ionization front or a supernova shock , then supernova contamination of protostars would indeed be a common process .",
    "thus we are motivated to study a mechanism by which supernova material may be deposited directly into forming solar systems : the injection of dense clumps of innermost supernova material such as those observed in sn 1987a and the cassiopeia a ( cas a ) supernova remnant . by means of high - resolution 3d numerical simulations",
    ", we consider how such highly - enriched dense knots enter and mix with the gas of a nearby molecular cloud , at the periphery of the h ii region in which the supernova progenitor resided .",
    "many interesting numerical studies of the interaction of cold , overdense clumps moving through a hot , lower density medium have been undertaken in other astrophysical contexts .",
    "klein et al .   ( 1994 ) studied the evolution of nonradiative clouds propagating through the general interstellar medium ( ism ) , showing that if the cloud velocity is much greater than its sound speed , it will be disrupted on a  cloud crushing \" timescale given by the time for the shock to cross the cloud interior .",
    "subsequent ism - scale studies showed that magnetic fields ( e.g.   mac low et al .",
    "1994 ) and radiative cooling that operates above the initial cloud temperature ( fragile et al .",
    "2005 ) were only able to delay this disruption by 1 - 2 cloud crushing times .",
    "however , if shock interactions are able to efficiently catalyze coolants that radiate efficiently below the initial cloud temperature , the cloud will collapse , a process that may lead to triggered star formation on galactic scales ( e.g. , fragile et al .",
    "2004 ; gray & scannapieco 2010 ) .",
    "even if cooling is efficient only above the initial cloud temperature , clumps can be maintained for long timescales if they move through the medium faster than the exterior sound speed , because of a bow shock that forms in front of them .",
    "analogous cases that have been modeled include comet shoemaker - levy 9 plunging through jupiter s atmosphere ( mac low & zahnle 1994 ) , clouds interacting with galaxy outflows ( cooper et al .",
    "2009 ) , high - velocity clouds orbiting the milky way ( kwak et al .",
    "2011 ) , and  bullets \" of ejecta from stellar outflows ( poludnenko et al .",
    "2004 ) , proto - planetary nebulae ( dennis et al .  2008 ) , and supernovae ( raga et al .  2007 ) moving through the ionized ism . the simulations presented in this paper also lie in this supersonic regime , but invoke a very different set of parameters from these previous studies .",
    "our simulations are the first to study the interaction of supernova bullets with the molecular gas at the periphery of an h ii region .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss the astrophysical context in which supernovae often take place , in an h ii region .",
    "we also discuss the evidence that a substantial portion of supernova ejecta explodes in the form of dense clumps . in ",
    "3 we outline the numerical methods by which we model the interaction of these clumps with the surrounding molecular cloud . in ",
    "4 we present the results of a parameter study designed to test the extent to which supernova material can penetrate into a molecular cloud and mix with molecular gas , as a function of clump velocity , mass , density , and other parameters . in  5 we discuss the implications of these results for the abundances of short - lived radionuclides and stable isotope anomalies in the early solar system , elemental variations among stars formed in the same cluster , and galactic enrichment in general .",
    "the environment of star formation has a large bearing on the sequence of events surrounding the explosion of a supernova and its injection into a forming solar system .",
    "first , it is important to recognize that most sun - like stars form in massive star forming regions .",
    "the complete census by lada & lada ( 2003 ) of stellar clusters embedded in molecular clouds shows that at least 70% , and probably closer to 90% , of _ all _ stars form in embedded clusters , and 90% of those stars that do ( i.e. , @xmath39 of all stars ) form in a cluster with mass @xmath40 .",
    "clusters can reach masses @xmath41 ( e.g. , the carina nebula has mass @xmath42 ; preibisch et al .",
    "the cluster initial mass function ( imf ) suggests that the number of clusters with mass @xmath43 scales as @xmath44 over the range @xmath45 , with @xmath46 observed to be in the range 1.6 - 1.8 ( elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ) . assuming similar star formation efficiencies and stellar initial mass functions in all clusters ,",
    "this suggests that of all the stars born in embedded clusters with mass @xmath40 , @xmath47 ( i.e. , @xmath48 of all stars ) form in clusters with mass @xmath49 . this mass cutoff ( roughly the size of the orion nebula : hillenbrand et al .",
    "2001 ) is important because clusters above this size are likely to contain at least one star with mass @xmath50 that will rapidly explode as a supernova ( adams & laughlin 2001 ) .",
    "thus about three quarters of all sun - like stars form in a region that will experience a  prompt \" supernova .    the time for a star to explode as a supernova depends , of course , on its mass .",
    "stellar evolution models typically predict that the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae will stay on the main sequence for 3 - 20 myr : progenitors of masses @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 will explode after about 7 myr , 5 myr and 4 myr , respectively ( maeder & meynet 1989 ; schaller et al .",
    "the orion nebula , with about 3000 stars , contains one star that will explode as a supernova within 5 myr .",
    "richer clusters are more likely to contain more massive stars that evolve faster ( adams & laughlin 2001 ) .",
    "notably , while fewer than @xmath54 of clusters remain bound for more than about 10 myr ( lada & lada 2003 ) , a cluster almost certainly stays intact for at least 5 myr , while significant gas remains .",
    "thus , half of sun - like stars form in clusters in which the supernova occurs in the first 4 - 5 myr of the cluster lifetime .",
    "star formation appears to continue throughout the evolution of a rich cluster .",
    "young ( @xmath55 yr ) protostars are often seen even in h ii regions even several myr old ( palla & stahler 2000 ; hester et al .",

    "many of these authors attribute the late formation of the protostars to triggering by the advancing ionization fronts launched by the o stars in the cluster , which are the progenitors of the supernovae .",
    "we return to this argument in  5 , as it bears directly on the statistical likelihood that a _ newly _ formed ( @xmath56 myr old ) protostar can be contaminated by supernova ejecta .",
    "for now we note that protostars do apparently form throughout the evolution of a rich cluster , and that we expect them to be forming when the massive stars go supernova .",
    "when the most massive star in a cluster goes supernova , the protostars in the process of forming will lie several parsecs from the supernova . within an h ii region , the most massive stars are generally found near the center of the spatial distribution of stars ( e.g. , in the orion nebula cluster : hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) , where they may have formed , or relaxed dynamically on very short ( @xmath55 yr ) timescales ( allison et al .",
    "protostars , on the other hand , must form from the molecular gas on the periphery of the h ii region .",
    "the distance of the h ii region edge from the massive stars at its center is set by the rate of advance of the ionization front carving out the h ii region .",
    "the speed of propagation of this front depends not just on the ultraviolet ( uv ) flux from the massive stars but also the density of molecular gas . because of uncertainties in physical quantities and the rate of recombinations in the ionized gas , it is difficult to predict the speed of an ionization front from first principles",
    "nevertheless , propagation speeds @xmath57 are typically inferred ( osterbrock 1989 ) , both from simulations ( miao et al .",
    "2006 ) , and observations ( white et al .  1999",
    "; getman et al .  2007 ;",
    "choudhury et al .",
    "taking @xmath58 as a typical speed , we infer that by the time of the first supernova in an h ii region , at age 5 myr , molecular gas lies roughly 2 pc from the explosion .",
    "ejecta travelling at @xmath59 will cross this distance in only @xmath60 1000 yr , and will encounter molecular gas in which protostars are forming .",
    "the interaction between the molecular gas and the supernova ejecta that collide with it will depend greatly on the spatial distribution of the ejecta , and especially the ejecta density .",
    "numerical simulations of supernova explosions generally show that the outer layers ( the h- and he - burning shells ) explode isotropically , but the shells interior to this are subject to numerous rt and richtmyer - meshkov instabilities at compositional interfaces .",
    "these instabilities concentrate much of this interior ejecta into dense clumps ( arnett et al .",

    "strong evidence for clumpiness exists from observations of nearby supernova remnants .",
    "ejecta in sn1987a , especially the innermost , fe - bearing portions , appear clumpy .",
    "the early appearance of gamma rays ( matz et al .  1988 ) is consistent with concentration of @xmath61 into high - velocity clumps ( lucy et al .",
    "fe emission was far lower than expected for optically thin gas ( haas et al .",
    "fe ii emission disappeared around day 640 ( colgan et al .",

    "however , due to its age , the physical condition in the cygnus loop remnant is likely inapplicable to the ejecta properties at the early phase we are interested in . on the other hand , it is difficult to directly image fine structures in distant supernova remnants , but there is no reason to conclude that clumpiness is not a universal process at the early stage of supernova explosions .",
    "ouellette et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that the numerical simulations and observations of sn1987a and cas a are all consistent with a large fraction of the ejecta mass inside the h envelope exploding in the form of homologously expanding clumps .",

    "both the numerical simulations and observations are biased toward the largest clumps , and it must be understood that smaller clumps are also possible and may be more numerous .",
    "strong support for such dense clumps also comes from modeling of dust condensation in supernova ejecta .",
    "some presolar grains contain isotopic signatures of condensation from supernova ejecta : for example , presolar sic grains of supernova origin show evidence for large excesses of @xmath70 resulting from the decay of the neutron - rich isotope @xmath71 and some presolar graphite grains show isotopic evidence for condensation from supernova ejecta ( zinner et al .  2007 ) .",
    "these grains must form at about 1 year after the supernova explosion , after the ejecta have expanded and adiabatically cooled , but before the density has dropped too low for condensation ( kozasa et al .",

    "the condensation sequence of supernova graphites demands that they formed in clumpy ejecta significantly denser than isotropically exploding ejecta .",
    "the existence of two  phases \" of supernova ejecta  isotropically exploding outer layers , and clumpy inner layers  completely changes how ejecta will interact with the molecular cloud .",
    "assuming as much as @xmath81 of supernova material ( in the h shell ) explodes isotropically , producing a shell extending from , say 2.0 pc to 2.4 pc , its mean density will be @xmath82 , and its surface density will be @xmath83 .",

    "in contrast , the @xmath86 clumps modeled by ouellette et al .  (",
    "2010 ) have radii @xmath87 and surface densities @xmath88 .",
    "this means the clumps should propagate through the isotropic layer with little interaction .",
    "in fact , the clump densities of @xmath89 are comparable to the gas density in the molecular cloud .",
    "furthermore , what ouellette et al .",
    "( 2010 ) described were the largest clumps seen in numerical simulations and observations , and smaller ( possibly denser ) clumps are also possible .",
    "clumpy supernova ejecta stand a much better chance of penetrating into the molecular cloud than isotropic ejecta .",
    "motivated by these arguments , we carried out a suite of numerical simulations of the injection of supernova ejecta into the molecular gas at the periphery of an h ii region .",
    "all simulations were using the flash 3.2 multidimensional , adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code ( fryxell et al .",
    "2000 ) that solves the riemann problem on a cartesian grid with a directionally - split piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) ( colella & woodward 1984 ; colella & glaz 1985 ; fryxell et al .",
    "we initialized the problem with a planar contact discontinuity at @xmath90 , separating warm ionized gas in the h ii region from colder neutral gas in the molecular cloud ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "both media are assumed to be uniform in density and temperature , and in pressure equilibrium at @xmath91 .",
    "the gas in the h ii region is assumed to have density @xmath92 and temperature 8000 k , and to be fully ionized with mean molecular weight @xmath93 .",
    "the molecular gas is assumed to have a density @xmath94 and temperature 40 k. for simplicity and to better approximate the equation of state of molecular gas when it is shocked , we set its molecular weight to 0.6 as well .",
    "for the same reasons , we set the ratio of specific heats in both regions to be @xmath95 .",
    "thus we do not treat energy losses from dissociation and ionization in our simulations , but these are probably unimportant as the energies are small compared to the kinetic energies of the supernova ejecta material .    in the time before the explosion , the massive progenitor will launch a d - type ionization front which drives a shock that compresses gas several @xmath96 ahead of the ionization front ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "we do not include this shock in our simulations , deferring a more exact treatment for future work .",
    "instead , the two media are assumed to be static before the introduction of ejecta .",
    "turbulent motions and density inhomogeneities in the cloud are also neglected , as is the bulk ( outward ) motion of the shocked molecular gas .",
    "these motions have magnitudes @xmath97 , much smaller than the speeds of the ejecta and gas shocked by the ejecta .",
    "again , inclusion of these effects is deferred for future work .",
    "supernova ejecta enter the molecular cloud by moving in the @xmath98 direction .",
    "isotropic ejecta are modeled as a planar pulse of material on the three - dimensional cartesian grid , while clumps of ejecta are modeled as spherical bodies .",
    "we model only a single clump during each simulation . based on the discussion of clumps in the cas a supernova remnant (  2.2 ) , the fiducial values for the clumps masses and radii are @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which correspond to a density @xmath101 .",
    "we assume a typical speed of @xmath102 .",
    "this is of the same order as the expansion rate of the cas a supernova remnant ( chevalier & liang 1989 ) and of many clump velocities , although many clumps also move faster than this ( fesen et al .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty associated with these values , and we consider a range of input parameters about these fiducial values .",
    "the temperatures inside the clumps are set to 100 k , due to the fact that they are dense and cool effectively .",
    "the exact value is unimportant because each clump will reach very high temperatures when they are heated by an internal reverse shock after entering the molecular cloud .    the small clump sizes and large penetration distances we are interested in together demand a high numerical resolution .",
    "for example , to resolve a clump of size @xmath103 using just 5 zones , on a grid @xmath104 across , requires an effective resolution of @xmath1 . in our fiducial runs",
    ", we choose the refinement level of the adaptive mesh such that the smallest resolved scale , @xmath105 , is @xmath106 cm .",
    "our runs were primarily 3d , although we did conduct some high - resolution 2d cylindrically - symmetric runs for comparison , as discussed in  4.4.4 .",
    "in addition to the hydrodynamic equations , we evolve a scalar field , @xmath107 , representing the concentration of heavy elements in an ejecta clump . rather than assign to the clump a specific composition from a particular zone within the supernova , we use this scalar as a generic tracer of ejected material , initializing it to be unity inside a clump and zero elsewhere .",
    "the scalar field is then passively advected in the flow and provides important information about the transport and the mixing status of the ejecta material in the molecular cloud .",
    "cooling of the shocked gas is an important effect and is included in our runs .",
    "the postshock temperatures following the passage of a shock with speed @xmath108 are @xmath109 , implying emission of x - ray photons .",
    "we assume a cooling function over a temperature range @xmath110 from the tables compiled by wiersma et al .",

    "in our first set of numerical experiments , we investigate the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the molecular cloud assuming an isotropic expansion of the ejecta material .",
    "we model the isotropic ejecta as a planar pulse , and the initial condition of the ejecta is set to be a uniform slab , moving toward the molecular cloud with a velocity of @xmath126 . the thickness and the density of the slab",
    "are set to @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "these parameters correspond to a total ejecta mass of 20 @xmath129 distributed uniformly in a spherical shell of thickness @xmath130 pc , located at a distance of 2 pc from the explosion center .",
    "as mentioned earlier , isotropically expanding ejecta will have very low density ; the ejecta density used here is @xmath131 times smaller than the adopted density for the molecular cloud .",
    "we placed this slab in the h ii region with its right edge initially located at a distance of @xmath132 from the contact discontinuity at @xmath90 .",
    "we applied the outflow boundary condition to all the six sides of the simulation box .",
    "once the ejecta encounters the molecular cloud at @xmath90 , a contact discontinuity between ejecta gas and molecular gas develops , and a shock is driven into the molecular gas . although our simulations were three - dimensional and allowed for complex structures , both the contact discontinuity and the shock remained planar and essentially one - dimensional . because of the lack of complex structure we do not present figures depicting these simulations .    in our first simulation",
    ", we neglected the radiative cooling .",
    "we find in this case that the high pressure in the postshock gas efficiently decelerates the low - density ejecta , and finally pushes all the ejecta material back to the @xmath133 region . in the first",
    "200 yr , a small fraction ( 20% ) of the ejecta material manages to pass the @xmath90 plane , but it only reaches a negligibly small distance ( @xmath134 cm ) before it starts to move backward at @xmath135 yr , due to the large postshock pressure . by 500 yr ,",
    "all of the ejecta material has  bounced \" back into @xmath133 . in these simulations without cooling , the ejecta does not remain in contact with the molecular gas long enough to mix into it , even if the structure had not remained planar .",
    "we next conducted a second simulation identical to the first but including radiative cooling .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the cooling timescale in the postshock gas is quite short , @xmath136 yr for our fiducial parameters , so it is unsurprising that cooling changes the dynamical behavior of the gas .",
    "the radiative cooling is found to reduce the postshock pressure , which , in a cooling timescale , becomes significantly smaller than in the case neglecting cooling .",
    "our simulation shows that the efficient cooling gives rise to the formation of a dense shell behind the shock in a few hundred years .",
    "the molecular gas swept up by the shock piles up in the shell , whose width increases with time .",
    "due to the reduction of the postshock pressure by cooling , the ejecta material can follow the shell , and continuously fill up the space behind the condensed gas .",
    "in other words , when the radiative cooling is accounted for , the molecular gas can be compressed and pushed by the ejecta . despite this , both the contact discontinuity and the shock are found to remain planar , with no mixing of ejecta into the shocked molecular gas .",
    "we observed the ejecta concentration field , @xmath137 , to remain at its initial value ( @xmath138 ) on the left side of the discontinuity and to be zero on the right side .",
    "as may be expected , the contact discontinuity is found to move with a speed 3/4 of the shock velocity at all times .",
    "the contact discontinuity persisted throughout the run and no shear or shear - related instabilities were observed to arise .",
    "the rt instability was not observed either , nor should it arise , because the density of the ejecta is significantly lower than the molecular gas .",
    "in these runs we observed no instabilities at the contact discontinuity between ejecta gas and the molecular cloud , meaning there is no mechanism to mix the ejecta gas with the molecular cloud material that will go on to form protostars .",
    "one effect that may alter this picture is pre - existing turbulence in the molecular cloud , wherein random motions may perturb the shock front .",
    "a more likely mechanism is pre - existing density inhomogeneities in the molecular cloud such as cloud cores .",
    "the interaction of a cloud core with a sweeping shock has been explored by boss and collaborators ( e.g. , boss et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 , boss and keiser 2010 ) . shear and",
    "kelvin - helmholtz instabilities would arise as the shock sweeps past these cloud cores .",
    "future work will further explore these alternative scenarios . in the present work",
    ", we find that if ejecta are homogeneously distributed , then mixing of ejecta material into the molecular cloud gas is unlikely , because of the low density of the ejecta and the large density contrast it has with the molecular gas .",

    "the rt instability was not observed around the ejecta .",
    "this may be due to the fact that we could only achieve a numerical resolution corresponding to 5 zones across the clump .",
    "mac low & zahnle ( 1994 ) , in their 2d cylindrical simulations of the breakup of comet shoemaker - levy 9 in jupiter s atmosphere , have argued that 25 zones across the projectile are required to resolve rt instabilities .",

    "a significant fraction of the ejecta lags behind the shock , and some fraction of this material even moves backward and starts to leave the computational domain by @xmath149 yr .",

    "yr , only 2% of the original clump mass remains in the cloud .",
    "we expect that even less of the clump mass would be injected into the cloud at longer times .",
    "we also found the same general trend for the clump mass to  bounce \" out of the cloud in 2d simulations of the same problem using cylindrical coordinates , as already seen in the isotropic ejecta case .",
    "these effects are not sensitive at all to the clump parameters or the numerical resolution .",
    "we conclude that in the case where radiative cooling is neglected , clumps of ejecta are not injected into the molecular cloud .",
    "instead , similar to an inelastic collision between a ball and fixed wall , they are effectively bounced off of the molecular cloud surface by the large postshock pressure .          in the preceding simulations",
    "not including cooling , clumpy ejecta manage to move farther ( to larger @xmath121 ) than the isotropic ejecta , but ultimately they are expelled from the molecular cloud by the high post - shock pressures without mixing into the cloud .",
    "we expect that if cooling is significant , it should reduce this pressure and allow deeper penetration of the clumpy ejecta into the cloud . including cooling",
    "as outlined in  3 , we find that the high density of the molecular cloud does result in a significant drop in postshock temperature and pressure , because of the very short cooling timescale .",
    "for our adopted cooling rates , molecular gas with a preshock number density @xmath84 , shocked by a @xmath126 shock to a temperature @xmath154 will cool in only @xmath155 .",

    "radiative cooling is now significant and the postshock pressure is reduced , allowing the ejecta to more closely follow the shock front . as seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ cooling ] , the ejecta opens up a narrow channel into the molecular cloud at @xmath164 . at",
    "about this time , the shock front propagation in the @xmath121-direction becomes driven essentially by the momentum of the ejecta alone , and the ejecta motion appears to be ballistic .",
    "due to the lack of strong lateral pressure gradients , the expansion in the lateral direction is weak .",
    "initially , both the length and width of the channel increase with time ( akin to a mach cone ) .",
    "after @xmath165 , the ejecta have lost significant momentum and the shock does not move significantly in the @xmath121-direction , even as the channel width keeps growing in the @xmath146 and @xmath161-directions .",

    "[ cooling ] plots the concentration of supernova material in the gas .",
    "although the central two panels leave the impression that a considerable amount of ejecta is bounced out of the cloud to @xmath167 , the dark blue regions on the left with high ejecta concentration actually have little ejecta mass , because the gas density is extremely low in this region .",
    "in fact , during the entire simulation ( up to 30,000 yr ) , nearly all ( 93% ) of the ejecta remain in the computational domain , and a very high fraction ( 86% ) are delivered deep into the molecular cloud .",

    "as before , rt instabilities were not observed around the ejecta material in the channel .",
    "it is possible that the rt instability may have been suppressed by the efficient radiative cooling , which reduces the pressure in the postshock regions and thus leads to a slower relative acceleration between the ejecta and the shocked gas .",
    "it is also likely that emergence of the rt instability requires higher numerical resolution than we achieved , since rt instabilities were not observed in the case without cooling , either .",
    "we do observe an rt - like ( richtmyer - meshkov ) instability as the dilute high - pressure gas is pushed back to the warm ionized gas on the left side ( see the third right panel in fig .",

    "radiative cooling is a significant effect and plays a crucial role in the delivery of supernova material into a nearby molecular cloud .",

    "confusing the issue , however , is the fact that @xmath171 for the @xmath100 case is intermediate between the two cases with larger @xmath194 .",

    "fragmentation and production of a cone - like structure around the penetration axis also occurred for the clump of the largest size , @xmath243 , but in this case a significant fraction of the ejecta remained concentrated along the @xmath237 axis , opening a narrow channel into the molecular cloud . because ejecta delivery through the channel is so efficient , the production of a more well defined channel led to a greater delivery distance @xmath171 . in tandem",
    ", the fraction of ejecta remaining in the molecular cloud is seen to increase with increasing @xmath194 .",

    "[ 3dplot ] , which presents three - dimensional renderings of the ejecta density ( gas density times concentration field ) for our fiducial parameters but three values of the clump radius .",
    "repeating these calculations for a lower clump velocity , @xmath236 ( cases 2 , 13 and 14 ) , we find that the delivery distance tends to increase monotonically with increasing @xmath194 . in these runs",
    ", the clumps remained coherent and did not fragment .",
    "the trends of @xmath171 with @xmath194 suggest that the delivery distance is controlled by the momentum per cross - sectional area of the clump , scaling roughly linearly with @xmath194 . as before",
    ", the fraction of ejecta remaining in the cloud increases with increasing @xmath194 , and is generally higher .",
    "combined with the above results , delivery of ejecta appears to become more complicated when the clump size is large , and is sensitive to the manner in which the clump fragments , perhaps by a thermal instability .",
    "we attribute the fragmentation we observe to a cooling instability that occurs when the cooling function is such that compression leads to runaway cooling ( field 1965 ; field et al .",
    "this has the effect of increasing density perturbations in the post - shock region , leading to fragmentation of the ejecta .",
    "this fundamentally changes its interaction with the surrounding material as it moves through the molecular cloud .",
    "the sensitivity of the delivery distance to fragmentation begs the question of whether the ejecta clump would fragment for the fiducial parameters ( including @xmath100 ) if a higher numerical resolution were employed .",
    "it is not possible to completely rule out the existence of instabilities on smaller scales , but we did not observe the fragmentation behavior during our high - resolution run with twice the numerical resolution ( case 16 ; see  4.5 ) .",
    "we speculate that @xmath100 and @xmath102 might represent a threshold case .    to summarize , the trends with density , radius and mass , the distance reached by supernova material in the molecular cloud scales with the momentum per cross - sectional area of the clump , i.e. , as @xmath246 or @xmath247 .",
    "thus , for a fixed density , larger radii and mass lead to larger @xmath171 although this general trend is complicated by the possibility that clumps can fragment , reducing @xmath171 because the ejecta are spread out over a larger cross - sectional area , slowing them more quickly . on the other hand , increasing the density at a fixed radius increases the penetration distance both because it increases the initial momentum per cross until area , and because it reduces the cooling time , reducing lateral spreading in the early stages of the collision .",
    "the fraction of ejecta remaining in the molecular cloud at 30,000 years tends to be large ( @xmath248 ) when @xmath249 .",
    "finally , the sensitivity of our calculated results to instabilities acting on small scales strongly motivates a study of whether we have achieved or are approaching numerical convergence . in fig .",
    "[ 3dresolution ] we track the delivery distance of supernova material as a function of time , for three effective grid resolutions , @xmath250 ( case 15 ) , @xmath251 ( case 3 ) , and @xmath252 ( case 16 ) .",
    "other parameters were held at their fiducial values .",
    "it is clearly seen that the clump is essentially not resolved for @xmath253 , in which case the entire clump is concentrated in a few grid zones . in this case",
    "the ejecta material spreads rapidly in the lateral direction due to numerical diffusion , effectively stopping the clump . with increasing resolution this effect decreases , and we observe the root - mean - square displacement of the ejecta material to decrease .",
    "the greater concentration of ejecta around the penetration axis leads to an increase of @xmath171 . as the resolution increases from @xmath142 to @xmath254 ( so that 10 zones are spread across the diameter of the clump ) , @xmath171 increases by 30% , almost entirely due to physical effects occurring in the first @xmath255 years of the simulation .",
    "after this initial stage , during which the clump moves about @xmath256 ( for @xmath251 ) or @xmath257 ( for @xmath252 ) , the clump moves an additional @xmath257 for both resolutions .",
    "these results indicate that numerical convergence has not yet been achieved , at least during the initial ( @xmath258 ) stages .",
    "increasing numerical resolution introduces several competing effects . on the one hand , higher resolution prevents the numerical diffusion that can artificially spread the ejecta . on the other hand ,",
    "increasing numerical resolution prevents numerical suppression of physical instabilities like fragmentation that would actually spread the ejecta in nature .",
    "strict numerical convergence requires these instabilities to dominate and reach a saturated state , which may not be easily achieved .",
    "another effect of higher resolutions is that density and temperature fluctuations are better captured . because of the quadratic dependence of cooling rate on density",
    ", higher resolutions can lead to a faster overall cooling rate in the postshock region , which would have the effect of decreasing @xmath171 .",
    "unfortunately , simulations with higher grid resolution are not possible in the context of the current study .",
    "because flash is an explicit code subject to the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) stability criterion , doubling the grid resolution in a 3d simulation effectively increases the number of grid zones by a factor of @xmath259 and the number of timesteps by a factor of 2 , meaning over an order - of - magnitude increase in computational time .",
    "although these effects can be ameliorated somewhat by adopting more aggressive derefinement criteria and further restricting the computational domain size , we expect that increasing the resolution to @xmath260 would require @xmath261 million cpu hours per run , which is beyond our capabilities here .     as a function of time , for three different values of the effective numerical resolution , @xmath250 ( dotted ) , @xmath142 ( solid ) , and @xmath254 ( dashed ) .",

    "a comparison of fig .",
    "[ 2dresolution ] with fig .",
    "[ 3dresolution ] reveals that @xmath171 in the 2d runs were typically 10 - 15% greater than in the corresponding 3d runs at a given numerical resolution .",
    "this is likely due to the imposition of axisymmetry , which suppresses some kh or other unstable modes that would spread the material , and by the restriction that material must remain centered on the penetration axis .",
    "for example , the fragmentation we observed in the 3d cases with @xmath242 was not observed in the corresponding 2d run .",

    ", we did not observe any converging trends .",
    "we infer that this lack of convergence is due to the fact that in 2d , physical instabilities that might spread the clump laterally are suppressed , and numerical diffusion dominates the lateral spreading ; and we infer that numerical diffusion is still significant even at our highest resolution . in summary , we conclude that 2d simulations fundamentally differ from the 3d simulations , and do not provide a useful comparison .",

    "adding to the difficulty is that cooling can be effective , and via cooling instabilities can drive the shocked gas to collapse to smaller scales . on the other hand",

    "numerical resolution is a real concern .",
    "metrics like the mean distance traveled by ejecta after a stopping time ( i.e. , @xmath171 at 30,000 years ) are sensitive to physical conditions in the first 1000 years of the interaction and vary non - monotonically as the numerical resolution increases .",
    "convergence is difficult to achieve because of the very large span of length scales in the problem : clumps travel @xmath275 times their own diameter , and fragment by kh and possibly cooling instabilities , into even smaller scales .",

    "the conditions under which ejecta remain in the cloud appear to hinge entirely on the cooling timescale .",
    "if cooling is not sufficiently rapid , the post - shock pressure builds to the point that the bulk of the ejecta is expelled from the molecular cloud .",
    "efficient injection requires a cooling timescale not much greater than the dynamical timescale , @xmath157 .",
    "the cooling timescale decreases in inverse proportion to the post - shock density , and a threshold density exists for injection of material , which is very roughly 6 times the density of the molecular gas .",
    "the cooling timescale also increases sensitively with post - shock temperature , and therefore shock speed .",
    "an optimal ejecta velocity @xmath220 exists for injection , and the depth of delivery , @xmath278 and the fraction injected , @xmath279 decrease with increasing @xmath192 .",
    "another robust trend is that if cooling is effective , @xmath171 appears to correlate with the clump s momentum per unit area .",
    "clumps with higher @xmath246 generally travel farthest , but @xmath171 does not monotonically increase with this quantity because instabilities can cause the clump to laterally spread , decreasing its momentum per area .",
    "these instabilities manifest themselves more prominently when the radius of the clump is increased and is therefore better resolved . in all cases where the clump penetrates beyond @xmath280 , @xmath248 of the clump material remains in the molecular cloud at late times , and @xmath191 increases with @xmath171 .",
    "our ability to numerically model the full range of parameters relevant to the supernova injection problem is incomplete .",
    "for example , clumps can be smaller ( below the imaging resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _ ) and denser than we accounted for , and many clumps in the cas a supernova remnant are likely to be traveling at speeds @xmath217 ( fesen et al .",
    "2001 ) . smaller clumps and faster shock speeds are very difficult to numerically compute ; because of the limitations of the cfl condition , even a factor of 2 increase in resolution requires an order of magnitude more computing time .",
    "as well , we did not vary the density of gas in the molecular cloud .",
    "gas at the tops of the pillars in m16 has been shocked by the advancing d - type ionization front , and is characterized by densities @xmath281 , an order of magnitude higher than the densities we assumed .",
    "density inhomogeneities such as star - forming cores within the molecular cloud would affect the propagation of ejecta material as well , and turbulent motions which must be present in the molecular cloud would affect the diffusion of material and the minimum lengthscales of coherent structures .    despite these limitations ,",
    "we have gained enough insight from our parameter studies to predict how injection would proceed under different scenarios .",
    "one relevant set of parameters might be high - velocity ( @xmath197 ) clumps encountering denser ( @xmath282 ) molecular gas .",
    "a shock speed that is a factor of 3 higher than our canonical value suggests a postshock temperature an order of magnitude higher ( @xmath283 ) , and a cooling timescale about a factor of 3 longer ( see fig .  1 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the higher density of gas in the molecular cloud leads to postshock densities an order of magnitude greater , and a cooling timescale a factor of 10 smaller .",
    "this means cooling timescales are likely to be sufficiently short to allow efficient injection of clumpy supernova material into molecular gas that has already been shocked by a d - type ionization front .    while much work remains to be done",
    ", our initial investigations clearly indicate that supernova clumps can be injected efficiently in to molecular material in many cases .",
    "when the ejecta finally come to rest , a large fraction of the clump mass will remain in the molecular cloud , mixing into material that is in the midst of collapsing to form new sun - like stars .",
    "to determine the degree to which a forming solar system is contaminated by supernova material , we assume there are @xmath284 clumps of mass @xmath285 , so that @xmath286 , the mass of the ejecta that is not ejected isotropically",
    ". implicitly neglecting density variations within the molecular cloud , we assume that the periphery of the h ii region traces a sphere of radius @xmath287 centered on the supernova , consistent with the assumption that the supernova progenitor was the dominant source of the ionizing photons that carved out the h ii region .",
    "as discussed in  2.1 , based on a main - sequence lifetime for the progenitor of 5 myr and an ionization front that advances at @xmath58 , we adopt a value @xmath288 . on average ,",
    "the cross - sectional area of the molecular cloud that is associated with each clump is @xmath289 @xmath290 or @xmath291 for our adopted parameters , such that clumps will be separated by @xmath292 .",
    "the separation between clumps is surprisingly close to the width of the channel that is carved out in our fiducial runs , @xmath293 , which is not significantly wider than the distribution of ejecta ( fig .",
    "this suggests that lateral mixing may be rapid enough to contaminate the gas between channels .",
    "we do not explicitly model the turbulence that would effect this mixing , but we can estimate the mixing timescale by assuming that turbulence operates at least as effectively as in the pre - shocked molecular cloud .",
    "the turbulent mixing timescale at a lengthscale @xmath294 scales as @xmath295 , where @xmath296 is the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations on the scale @xmath294 ( pan & scannapieco 2010 ) .",
    "on the scale of the channel separation , @xmath297 , we estimate @xmath298 using the larson scaling law ( larson 1981 ) .",
    "thus the mixing timescale across 0.1 pc would be @xmath299 .",
    "this should be viewed as an upper limit for mixing , because of several factors that would increase turbulence and @xmath296 .",
    "for example , the interaction of the underlying turbulent gas with the shocks created by the clump may increase the turbulent velocity fluctuations ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "the mixing timescale of @xmath300 is slightly longer than the duration of our simulations , but interestingly are comparable to the free - fall timescale ( @xmath301 ) on which this molecular gas will form protostars . mixing across multiple channel separations ( i.e. , 0.3 pc ) , however , takes significantly longer .",
    "thus , for the purposes of estimating the magnitude of isotopic anomalies , we assume that the gas between channels is contaminated effectively by the ejecta deposited in the nearest few channels .    assuming effective mixing , the volume of molecular gas that is associated with a single clump is @xmath302 . if the ejecta mix evenly throughout this entire volume , the fraction of the mass that comes from the supernova would then be @xmath303 @xmath304 here we must interpret @xmath305 as the total mass of clumpy supernova material , as isotropic ejecta do not inject efficiently .",
    "this is the average concentration of supernova material in the molecular gas , up to a depth of about 0.5 pc .",
    "clearly , the physical parameters of individual ejecta clumps affect @xmath306 only through @xmath172 , whose dependence on these parameters has been studied in  4.4 .",
    "the fraction @xmath306 is likely insensitive to @xmath307 .",
    "this is because the penetration of clumps into the molecular cloud , when successful , is limited by the momentum of the clumps , and thus the product of @xmath172 and @xmath307 is expected to be roughly constant .",
    "note that this is an _ average _ concentration of all the ejecta lying within 0.5 pc of the ionization front , and higher concentrations are possible in smaller fractions of the volume .",
    "note also that the average concentration of supernova material is lower at greater distances , but still substantial .",
    "if the ionization front were at 4 pc instead of 2 pc , for example , the concentration would be reduced by less than a factor of 4 , because the clump would have expanded , lowering its column density and reducing @xmath172 .",
    "the point is that even at a different distance the molecular gas still would be robustly contaminated by the supernova at a significant level .",
    "we note again that ongoing star formation is observed in the molecular gas at the edges of of h ii regions , probably triggered by the shocks driven a few tenths of a pc in advance of the ionization front ( e.g. , snider et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ; see also  2.1 ) .",
    "there is the additional intriguing possibility that the shocks propagating through the molecular cloud , driven by the clumps themselves , could trigger new star formation .",
    "this star formation is expected to take @xmath308 , based on the evolutionary state of protostars that are uncovered by ionization fronts ( hester et al .",
    "2004 ; hester & desch 2005 ; snider et al .",
    "this is comparable to the mixing timescale derived above , suggesting that each protostar is likely to acquire material from just one or a few clumps , and incorporation of this material is likely to take place shortly before or during star formation .",
    "thus , provided the sun formed at the periphery of an h ii region , it is likely to have incorporated supernova material from a single small region or mixture of a few small regions from the nearby supernova . adopting a mixing ratio @xmath309 ,",
    "the abundance of an element or isotope in the solar nebula can be determined if the composition of that clump can be constrained .",
    "obviously it is possible to pick any number of small regions within a  prompt \" supernova of any arbitrary mass @xmath310 , and a full exploration of the problem is not possible here , although we can make general estimates .    for example , the total amount of @xmath10 that is produced in a @xmath52 progenitor is @xmath311 ( ellinger et al .",
    "this implies that after mixing , @xmath312 mass of gas will contain about @xmath313 of @xmath10 .",
    "this is to be compared to the mass of @xmath314 in the solar system , which is about @xmath315 using the abundances of lodders ( 2003 ) .",
    "this estimate immediately suggests that within the contaminated portions of the molecular cloud , @xmath316 , _ on average_. this is remarkably comparable to the initial @xmath14 ratio @xmath15 inferred for the solar nebula ( macpherson et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "there are several factors that could cause the @xmath14 ratio to deviate significantly from this approximate average value .",
    "first , it is not certain that mixing within the molecular cloud following the injection can proceed to completion , so that regions near the channels carved out by the ejecta might be over - enriched with respect to the surrounding gas .",
    "also , because the solar system could have been contaminated by any small region within the supernova material , which varies by an order of magnitude in its @xmath10 content .",
    "for example , in the 1d calculations by ellinger et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the sub - explosive c - burning regions produced @xmath317 of @xmath10 , despite making up a small fraction of the supernova mass . and in the 3d simulations by ellinger et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , some @xmath318 smoothed - particle - hydrodynamics ( sph ) particles contained @xmath319 of @xmath10 , yielding an even higher mass fraction of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , again assuming a mixing ratio @xmath6 , if only one of these @xmath10-rich clumps contaminated the solar nebula , the initial @xmath14 ratio would be @xmath320 over ten times the observed value .",
    "currently , it is not possible to predict the initial abundance of @xmath10 any better than this , but it is clear that if the solar nebula formed from molecular gas contaminated by an @xmath10-rich clump , then its initial ratio would be comparable to the value observed in meteorites .",
    "using the same example dataset of ellinger et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we can also estimate the shifts in elemental and isotopic abundances of oxygen . in their 1d model of a @xmath52 progenitor ,",
    "the total ejected mass of o ( almost all @xmath35 ) is @xmath321 .",
    "assuming a mixing ratio of @xmath322 implies that @xmath323 of oxygen is injected , on average , into every @xmath312 mass of molecular gas that will form a solar system .",
    "this is to be compared to the mass of oxygen in the solar system , @xmath324 ( lodders 2003 ) , which implies that on average the late - forming stars at the edge of the h ii will see increases in their oxygen content by 3% , although again some clumps will be significantly more oxygen - rich than average .",
    "the sub - explosive c burning zones in the 1d models themselves produced @xmath325 of oxygen ( again , almost all @xmath35 ) , despite their lower mass overall , suggesting that larger shifts in oxygen abundance , potentially several tens of percent , are not unreasonable for some stars .",
    "the isotopic shifts in o associated with injection of supernova material also were considered by ellinger et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . assuming that sufficient @xmath10 is injected into the forming solar system to explain the meteoritic abundance @xmath326",
    ", they found isotopic shifts in oxygen could span a wide range of values .",
    "for the 1d models , a clump from the sub - explosive c - burning zones of a @xmath52 progenitor tends to inject nearly pure @xmath35 , dropping both the @xmath327 and @xmath328 ratios in the solar system , equivalent to a decrease in @xmath329 by roughly 35 permil in the cosmochemicalnotation . for this case",
    "there is little change in the @xmath330 ratio , but in 3d simulations , they found that many @xmath10 producing regions were significantly enhanced in @xmath33 relative to @xmath34 , an effect that was especially strong in anisotropically exploding supernovae ( ellinger et al .",
    "thus , injection of enough @xmath10 to explain the meteoritic evidence could shift the @xmath330 ratio by a factor of 2 , by increasing @xmath331 by @xmath332 per mil with little change in @xmath329 .",
    "this injection of @xmath333o into the solar system as it formed would decrease @xmath334 by a shift comfortably larger than the 300 permil shift inferred by young et al ( 2011 ) . in summary ,",
    "exact shifts in elemental and isotopic abundances will depend on where within the supernova the one or few clumps that contaminated the solar system came from , so it is premature to try to predict the exact shifts .",
    "nevertheless , supernova contamination of molecular gas appears able to qualitatively explain the abundance of @xmath10 and the shifts in oxygen abundance and isotopic composition inferred for our solar system .",
    "injection of supernova material into an already - formed protoplanetary disk has been critically examined by gounelle & meibom ( 2007 ) and williams & gaidos ( 2007 ) .",
    "the general point raised by these authors is that _ recently formed _",
    "disks are overwhelmingly likely to be several parsecs from the supernova progenitor , necessarily forming in the molecular gas at the periphery of the h ii region .",
    "looney et al .  ( 2006 ) made similar points .",
    "disks forming at @xmath335 from the supernova will intercept relatively little ejecta , so that insufficient @xmath10 could be intercepted to explain the meteoritic ratio .",
    "the meteoritic ratio @xmath326 , if the disk intercepts isotropically exploding ejecta , requires the disk to lie only @xmath297 from the supernova ( ouellette et al .  2005 , 2007 , 2010 ) .",
    "on the other hand , ouellette et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that a protoplanetary disk intercepting clumpy ejecta can receive much more material than a disk intercepting isotropic ejecta at the same distance .",
    "for example , considering the model discussed above , @xmath336 clumps of mass @xmath337 each , with radii @xmath338 , will have a volume filling fraction @xmath68 and will be 2700 times denser than isotropically expanding ejecta .",
    "such a clump could intecept a protoplanetary disk at a distance of 2 pc ( at which point its radius would be @xmath339 ) , and the disk would receive as much supernova material as if it were exposed to isotropically expanding ejecta at a distance of 0.04 pc . if the clump samples a @xmath10-rich region within the supernova , the disk could intercept even more @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the areal filling fraction of the ejecta clumps , at the boundary of the h ii region , will be only 2.8% , so only one in 36 disks at the time of the supernova would encounter such clumps . multiplying this fraction by the number of sun - like stars forming disks late in the evolution of an h ii region",
    ", we estimate that @xmath340 of sun - like stars will encounter significant amounts of supernova material during the protoplanetary disk stage .",
    "this scenario , suggested by chevalier ( 2000 ) and ouellette et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2007 , 2010 ) , remains a viable , but unlikely , explanation for slrs in the solar nebula .",
    "in contrast , injection of supernova material into molecular gas , just as stars and planetary systems are forming , appears to be robust . essentially _",
    "all _ stars forming late in the evolution of the star - forming region will be contaminated by some type of clumpy supernova material .",
    "the probability that a solar system would be contaminated is essentially the fraction of stars forming in a cluster rich enough to have a star @xmath310 in mass ( so that it explodes in @xmath341 ) , times the fraction of stars that form in such a cluster after 5 myr of evolution .",
    "as outlined in  2.1 , the first fraction is probably @xmath342 .",
    "the second fraction depends on the rate of star formation and is related to the question of whether star formation is triggered .",
    "multiple observations show that star formation is ongoing in h ii regions , even of ages 2 - 3 myr ( palla & stahler 2000 ; hester et al .",
    "1996 , 2004 ; healy et al .   2004 ;",

    "snider ( 2009 ) examined the ages of recently formed stars in several h ii regions using combined _ spitzer space telescope _ and _ hubble space telescope _ data .",
    "the analysis of ngc 2467 in particular was presented by snider et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who found that 30 - 45% of the sun - like stars in this h ii region were triggered to form after the initial formation of the cluster and the most massive stars , 2 myr ago .",
    "this implies that if the rate of triggered star formation is constant in time , and extends until the supernova explodes , at about 5 myr of age , then @xmath343 of sun - like stars in this cluster would form in the last 1 myr of star formation .",
    "if the rate of triggered star formation scales as the area swept out by the ionization front and therefore as the square of the age of the cluster , @xmath344 , then the fraction of stars forming in the last 1 myr before the supernova could be as high as @xmath345 .",
    "if approximately 75% of all sun - like stars form in a rich cluster with a star that will go supernova within 5 myr , and 10 - 40% of those stars form in the 1 myr before the supernova , then the likelihood of a sun - like star forming from gas contaminated by ejecta from a recently exploded supernova is on the order of 7 - 30% .",
    "this is a considerably higher probability than the @xmath346 probability of injection of an ejecta clump into a protoplanetary disk ( ouellette et al .",
    "more importantly , it suggests strongly that supernova contamination may be a common and universal process .",
    "if supernova contamination is a common process , one would expect to see variations in elemental abundances in spectra of sun - like stars .",
    "in fact , there is ample evidence from stellar spectra of planet - hosting stars for variability in elemental abundances .",
    "fischer & valenti ( 2005 ) surveyed 850 fgk - type stars that have doppler observations sufficient to uniformly detect all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes @xmath347 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr . among this sample they found variations of up to a factor two in [ na / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ti / fe ] , and [ ni / fe ] over the range -0.5@xmath348[fe / h]@xmath348 0.5 , and no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity .",
    "they concluded that host stars do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from non - host stars , and that host stars are simply born in higher - metallicity molecular clouds .",
    "bond et al .",
    "( 2008 ) analyzed elemental abundances for eight elements , including five heavy elements produced by the r- and s - processes , in 28 planetary host dwarf stars and 90 non - host dwarf stars .",
    "they found elemental abundances of planetary host stars are only slightly different from solar values , while host stars are enriched over non - host stars in all elements studied , varying by up to a factor of two but with enrichments of 14% ( for o ) and 29% around the mean .",
    "pagano et al .",
    "( 2010 ) examined elemental abundances for 13 elements in 52 dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood , and found the variations in c , o , na , al , mg , ca , and ti to be about a factor of two around the mean at the 3 @xmath349 level .    supernova injection into the molecular cloud from which protostars are forming remains a plausible mechanism for these variations , and may contribute to the abundances observed in planet - hosting stars .",
    "for example , as discussed in  5.2 , if clumps from different regions of a supernova could be injected into a @xmath312 mass cloud core as it was collapsing , at a mixing ratio @xmath309 ( see eq .  1 ) , one could get variations of the order observed .",
    "for example , an oxygen - rich clump could have an increase of up to 30% .",
    "it is worth noting that if the variability in stellar elemental abundances can be attributed to injection of supernova material , then observations like those mentioned above could be used to assess whether an exoplanetary system was contaminated by unobservable species .",
    "these could include short - lived radionuclides like @xmath10 , which are long extinct in any system older than a few myr , as well as p , which is difficult to observe because it lacks optical transition lines .",
    "massive stars produce a number of isotopes within a given mass shell , and these isotopic abundance ratios may be conserved within an impinging clump if mixing within the supernova explosion is not large .",
    "for example , young et al .",
    "( 2009 ) considered the co - spatial production of elements in supernova explosions , to find observationally detectable proxies for enhancement of @xmath350al .",
    "using several massive progenitor stars and explosion models , they found that the most reliable indicator of @xmath350al in an unmixed clump is a low s / si ratio of @xmath3510.05 . a clump formed from material within the o - ne burning shell",
    "should be enriched in both @xmath350al and @xmath352fe ( timmes et al 1995 , limongi & chieffi 2006 ) and the biologically important element p is produced at its highest abundance in the same regions ( young et al 2009 ) . even if these specific elemental ratios are not found , the supernova injection model broadly predicts that species co - produced within supernovae will tend to show correlated excesses in stellar spectra .",
    "observations of elemental abundances from stellar spectra can be used to test this hypothesis .",
    "finally , our results have implications for how the metals ejected by supernovae are released into the multiphase ism , a question of key importance in understanding their turbulent mixing on lengthscales @xmath353 ( roy & kunth 1995 ; scalo & elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "tenorio - tagle ( 1996 ) , for example , argued using simple estimates that metals are likely to be released directly into hot , thermalized superbubbles , which blow out of the galactic disk , only to cool and rain down later as metal - rich  droplets \" that are then broken apart by the rt instability . in this case",
    ", there would be a significant delay between metal production and enrichment , but after this delay metals would be deposited over large regions .",
    "a more detailed numerical study was carried out by de avillez & mac low ( 2002 ) , who examined turbulent mixing in a multiphase ism that was seeded with a scalar concentration field that varied on a fixed spatial scale that was uncorrelated with the locations of supernovae .",
    "they found that at early times the variance of the concentration decreased on a timescale that was proportional to the lengthscale of the initial fluctuations , and they argued that the late - time evolution was largely independent of this lengthscale . at early times , these results can be understood as being controlled by the mixing of metals in hot low - density environments , which occurs in any single temperature medium on a timescale set by the initial length fluctuations divided by the turbulent velocity ( pan & scannapieco 2010 ) . on the other hand , at late times the results might depend on the much slower process of mixing between hot and cold regions , which is set by the size of the cold clouds and their density contrast with the hot medium ( e.g.  klein , mckee , & colella 1994 ; fragile et al .",
    "more recently , ntormousi & burkert ( 2012 ) have emphasized the difficulty of mixing metals from the hot gas into the colder ism out of which new molecular clouds form , arguing that the enrichment of the cold ism will be delayed by at least a cooling time of the hot diffuse gas .",
    "the mixing of clumpy supernova ejecta directly into molecular clouds , seen in our simulations , would completely circumvent this limiting step in galactic chemical evolution . while a fraction of the elements deposited by this mechanism would be locked into sun - like stars formed in the wake of the d - type ionization front and supernova shock , at least as much enriched molecular material would be subsequently ionized and launched into the low - density ( @xmath354 ) , warm , ionized ( @xmath355 ) medium ( e.g. matzner & mckee 2000 ) .",
    "the higher densities of this gas lead to shorter cooling times and higher density contrasts , by orders of magnitude , greatly accelerating mixing , as compared to superbubbles .",
    "this process of warm - phase galactic enrichment merits further theoretical study and may be important in explaining the relative homogeneity of the milky way ism on @xmath356 scales ( meyer et al .  1998 ; cartledge et al .",
    "2006 ) , as well as the low dispersions seen in massive stars in nearby galaxies ( e.g.  kobulnicky & skillman 1996 ; 1997 ) .",
    "supernovae have long been implicated to explain stable isotope anomalies and the abundances of short - lived radionuclides in the early solar system . as the sun s elemental and isotopic abundances",
    "have become better constrained and compared to abundances in meteoritic material , presolar grains , and interstellar gas , it has also become increasingly apparent that the sun itself might have been contaminated by supernova material .",
    "surprisingly , large variations in elemental abundances among planet - hosting stars point to a similar stochastic contamination process by individual nearby supernovae .",
    "the traditional environment articulated for this contamination has been either ejecta sweeping over a distant @xmath357 molecular cloud core , injecting material as it prompts its collapse , or ejecta sweeping over a nearby ( @xmath358 ) protoplanetary disk .",
    "here we consider for the first time enrichment in the h ii region environment in which a core - collapse supernova is likely to take place .",
    "the explosion of a massive ( @xmath310 ) progenitor will occur within only 5 myr , before the ionization fronts launched by the progenitor can advance more than a few parsecs . at these times",
    "the material ejected by the supernova will interact with the molecular gas at the edge of the h ii region .",
    "supernova do not , in general , explode isotropically . instead",
    ", both numerical calculations and observations of sn1987a and the cas a supernova remnant indicate that clumpiness is a common feature .",
    "this clumpiness plays a crucial role in enrichment , as our numerical simulations find that isotropically exploding ejecta are too diffuse to penetrate into a molecular cloud . on the other hand , clumps with properties consistent with those in cas a deposit their material @xmath359 pc into the molecular cloud , but only if cooling is significant , such thatthe cooling timescale",
    "is @xmath360 .",
    "our simulations are limited by numerical resolution and were not able to span the entire set of relevant parameters , but these results appear robust .",
    "the gas at the edge of an h ii region is widely recognized to be the site of active star formation .",
    "it is likely that this star formation is triggered by the advance of the ionization fronts into the molecular gas , but the mechanism need not be identified to assert that the supernova material injected into the molecular gas at the edge of the h ii region will be taken up by forming solar systems .",
    "all of this star - forming material will be contaminated at an average mixing ratio @xmath6 .    both this mixing ratio and the compositions of small regions within modeled core - collapse supernovae are consistent with the quantities of @xmath10 injected into the early solar system as well as the elemental and isotopic shifts inferred in oxygen .",
    "possibly injection of @xmath32-rich silicon could also explain the difference in si isotopes between the sun and presolar grains .",
    "future work will examine whether specific regions within promptly exploding supernovae match the isotopic shifts inferred from meteorites and other observations .",
    "injection of clumpy supernova material into molecular gas at the edge of an h ii region can occur under very common conditions , and all of the stars forming late in the evolution of an h ii region are likely to be contaminated by this process . depending on the specific trigger for star formation and the overall rate of star formation , we estimate between 7 and 30% of _ all _ sun - like stars are likely to be contaminated by a single , nearby supernova .",
    "the injection process that we infer gave the solar system its inventory of @xmath10 and other isotopic anomalies may be a common , universal mechanism .",

    "<S> several lines of evidence , from isotopic analyses of meteorites to studies of the sun s elemental and isotopic composition , indicate that the solar system was contaminated early in its evolution by ejecta from a nearby supernova . </S>",
    "<S> previous models have invoked supernova material being injected into an extant protoplanetary disk , or isotropically expanding ejecta sweeping over a distant ( @xmath0 pc ) cloud core , simultaneously enriching it and triggering its collapse . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider a new astrophysical setting : the injection of clumpy supernova ejecta , as observed in the cassiopeia a supernova remnant , into the molecular gas at the periphery of an h ii region created by the supernova s progenitor star . </S>",
    "<S> to track these interactions we have conducted a suite of high - resolution ( @xmath1 effective ) three - dimensional numerical hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution of individual clumps as they move into molecular gas . even at these high resolutions , </S>",
    "<S> our simulations do not quite achieve numerical convergence , due to the challenge of properly resolving the small - scale mixing of ejecta and molecular gas , although they do allow some robust conclusions to be drawn . </S>",
    "<S> isotropically exploding ejecta do not penetrate into the molecular cloud or mix with it , but , if cooling is properly accounted for , clumpy ejecta penetrate to distances @xmath2 and mix effectively with large regions of star - forming molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the @xmath3 of high - metallicity ejecta from a single core - collapse supernova is likely to mix with @xmath4 of molecular gas material as it is collapsing . </S>",
    "<S> thus all stars forming late ( @xmath5 ) in the evolution of an h ii region may be contaminated by supernova ejecta at the level @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this level of contamination is consistent with the abundances of short - lived radionuclides and possibly some stable isotopic shifts in the early solar system , and is potentially consistent with the observed variability in stellar elemental abundances . </S>",
    "<S> supernova contamination of forming planetary systems may be a common , universal process . </S>"
