    "already in the 1930 s , tolman @xcite proposed that closed ( @xmath3 ) friedmannrobertsonwalker ( frw ) universe models might reexpand after collapsing towards a high density state in the future ; it was already known then that this was not possible for @xmath4 and @xmath5 models .",
    "this idea of a `` phoenix universe '' has remained popular ( see dicke and peebles @xcite for a discussion ) , and has reappeared recently in new forms , for example specifically in smolin s idea of collapse to a black hole state resulting in reexpansion into a new expanding universe region @xcite and more recently easson and brandenberger @xcite have discussed the general features all such scenarios have in common . thus it is interesting to investigate under what conditions such a bounce might take place within the context of general relativity and other theories of gravity ( see for example @xcite ) .    essentially because of the raychaudhuri equation @xcite , such bounces are not possible in frw models",
    "if the active gravitational mass is positive : that is , if @xmath6 . on the other hand quantum fields and indeed classical scalar fields can violate this condition @xcite .",
    "hence such fields can in principle allow bounce behaviour in frw models .",
    "however there are still other conditions that must be satisfied by such fields , for example the _ reality condition _ ( rc ) @xmath7 which is equivalent to requiring that the inertial mass density @xmath8 ( if this is not true , very anomalous physical behaviour can occur ) .",
    "thus it is interesting to see when bounces can occur without violating such conditions .",
    "it is not only frw models that are of interest .",
    "the geometry of the universe at a bounce might be very different than the completely isotropic and spatially homogeneous frw spacetimes ; indeed because some spatially homogeneous modes are unstable @xcite , some more general geometry might be expected .",
    "thus it is interesting to examine also what happens in models such as bianchi models which are anisotropic and spatially homogeneous , in order to start exploring the full phasespace of possibilities .",
    "additionally , in the scenario of black hole collapse and subsequent reexpansion , we might expect the geometry at the bounce to be that of a kantowskisachs @xmath3 model @xcite , because this model has the same symmetries as the spatially homogeneous interior region of the extended ( vacuum ) kruskal solution that represents the late stage of evolution of an isotropic black hole when the matter can be neglected .",
    "we may indeed expect that at late stages of collapse such a vacuum approximation will be valid , because in many bianchi universes anisotropy dynamically dominates over matter at early and late times @xcite .",
    "for these reasons we are interested in the bounce behaviour not only of frw models but also of bianchi and kantowskisachs universes . in this paper",
    ", we prove a number of relevant results .",
    "specifically , bounce behaviour in lrs bianchi types i ( bi ) and iii ( biii ) or kantowskisachs ( ks ) models with scalar fields violate the reality condition @xmath9 ( we assume that the energy flux and anisotropic pressure vanish : @xmath10 which follows for fields observed relative to the normal congruence of curves ) . for scalar field models with arbitrary selfinteraction",
    "we prove a _ nobounce _ theorem to this effect , viz .",
    "_ bounce behaviour in lrs bi , biii or ks models violates the reality condition_.    we then present additional results that restrict bounce behaviour in other spatially homogeneous models to closed frw and bianchi type ix .",
    "open frw and all ( un - tilted ) spatially homogeneous models all violate the weak energy condition ( wec ) @xmath11 _ and _ @xmath2 at the time of a bounce .",
    "the strong energy condition ( sec ) is violated in all such models , including flat frw models .",
    "the rc and the null energy condition are violated in all spatially homogeneous models with the exception of bianchi type ix and closed frw models .",
    "finally we turn our attention to the braneworld scenario of randall and sundrum @xcite . for a kantowski - sachs , bi or biii metric confined to a single three - brane embedded in a five - dimensional bulk , a nonlocal anisotropic pressure and negative nonlocal energy density ( e.g. _ dark radiation _ ) projected from the bulk onto the brane via the bulk weyl tensor modifies the einstein field equations sufficiently for bounce behaviour to be consistent with the rc .",
    "we should also mention efforts to solve the standard cosmological puzzles such as the flatness , homogeneity and monopole problems via ekpyrotic models @xcite in the braneworld context as potential alternatives to inflation despite being plagued with their own difficulties . in particular",
    "there has been considerable discussion in the literature on the evolution of cosmological perturbations through a bounce in the ekpyrotic scenario ( see @xcite for a representative sample ) . this issue",
    "although extremely interesting , does not directly related to main the aims of this paper .",
    "in this section we set up the equations needed to investigate whether or not the dynamics of lrs bi , biii and ks models admit bounce behaviour in the presence of a classical minimally coupled scalar field @xmath12 with a selfinteraction potential @xmath13 .",
    "the metric tensor for these models can be written in the following form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the expansion scale factors and we have chosen standard units where @xmath18 .",
    "relative to a normal congruence of curves with tangent vector @xmath19 , the energymomentum tensor @xmath20 for a scalar field takes the form of a perfect fluid ( see @xcite page 17 for details ) : @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23    it is easy to show that for the above metric and choice of @xmath19 , the einstein field equations can be written in terms of propagation equations for the usual expansion @xmath24 , shear @xmath25 and 3curvature @xmath26 scalars : @xmath27 and the gausscodazzi constraint @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a constant taking the values @xmath31 for bi , biii and ks models respectively .",
    "the above set of equations together with the kleingordon equation @xmath32 give a complete description of the dynamics of these universe models and solutions may be obtained once @xmath13 has been specified .",
    "the expansion may also be expressed in terms of a volume scale factor @xmath33 , viz .",
    "@xmath34 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there is an alternate route to finding solutions by noticing that equations ( [ field1 ] ) and ( [ field4 ] ) can be combined to give expressions for the potential and momentum density of the scalar field : @xmath35 so that in principle @xmath13 can be determined by first specifying the scale factor dependence @xmath16 and @xmath17 and then running the field equations backwards to determine the potential .",
    "this method has been used to generate exact frw inflationary solutions @xcite .",
    "the aim here is not to attempt to find exact solutions but examine whether it is possible to find solutions that exhibit bounce behaviour subject to the rc : @xmath0 .",
    "hence we need a precise definition of what a bounce is , together with a careful examination of equation ( [ reality ] ) .",
    "this is discussed in the next section .",
    "defining the expansion parameters @xmath36 a bounce in @xmath37 occurs at time @xmath38 iff @xmath39 and @xmath40 while a bounce in @xmath41 occurs at time @xmath42 iff @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear that although it may be possible to have a bounce in one of the scale factors but not the other , this does not lead to a new expanding universe region .",
    "we therefore require that a bounce occurs both in @xmath37 and @xmath41 scalefactors , even though they may in general occur at different times .",
    "let us now determine whether the rc for the scalar field is satisfied at a bounce . in order to do this",
    "we need to write equation ( [ reality ] ) in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 and their derivatives .",
    "this is most easily done by first substituting for the spatial curvature @xmath26 using equation ( [ field2 ] ) : @xmath47 now using @xmath48 we obtain @xmath49 we can now state and prove the main result of this section .",
    "+   + * theorem : * bounce behaviour in lrs bianchi type i , iii and kantowskisachs models dominated by a minimally coupled scalar field is not permitted unless the rc @xmath0 is violated .",
    "+   + * proof : * the proof follows immediately from equation ( [ reality2 ] ) when evaluated for a bounce in the @xmath41 direction at time @xmath42 . in this case @xmath43 and",
    "@xmath44 so ( [ reality2 ] ) simplifies to give @xmath50 , so that even if a bounce occurs in the @xmath37 direction it is only possible in the @xmath41 direction if the rc is violated .",
    "we now examine the extent to which energy conditions preclude bounce behaviour in isotropic , spatially homogeneous bianchi models of class a and b. we refer the reader to wainwright and ellis @xcite for an interesting review and classification of bianchi type universes .",
    "wald s no - hair theorem for global anisotropy can be found in @xcite .",
    "not all bianchi type models isotropize at large times .",
    "specifically , those types which do not admit frw solutions become highly anisotropic @xcite .",
    "models that do admit frw solutions ; bianchi i and @xmath51 admits k=0 solutions , bianchi v and @xmath52 admits @xmath5 solutions , and bianchi ix admits @xmath3 solutions .",
    "type @xmath52 will in general _ not _ approach isotropy , while the type ix models will recollapse after a finite time .    from the outset",
    "it is clear that bounce behaviour in the volume scale factor @xmath33 violates the sec .",
    "this can be seen from the raychaudhuri equation for spatially homogeneous cosmologies @xmath53 which simplifies to @xmath54 since @xmath55 at the bounce in the volume scale factor , and positivity results from @xmath56 being non - negative , together with the requirement that @xmath57 at the bounce .",
    "hence @xmath58 , violating the sec at the bounce .",
    "in addition to this , bounce behaviour in spatially homogeneous models with negative spatial curvature @xmath26 violates the wec _ @xmath1 and @xmath2_. to show this we use the friedmann constraint for spatially homogeneous cosmologies @xmath59 which simplifies to @xmath60 at the bounce , implying that @xmath61 , since @xmath56 is non - negative .",
    "this violates the wec in class a types ii , @xmath62 , @xmath51 ( except for a very special case ) and viii .",
    "bounce behaviour can be obtained in type ix models , which can have positive curvature . in class b ,",
    "the spatial curvature is negative for all models , hence the wec is violated in all class b models .",
    "finally , spatially homogeneous cosmologies satisfy the rc provided that @xmath63 this constraint ( c.f equation 13 ) is obtained by subtracting equations ( [ d.1 ] ) and ( [ d.3 ] ) , and then rearranging terms .",
    "bounce behaviour implies that @xmath64 , since the shear @xmath56 is non - negative .",
    "hence we can write condition ( [ d.4 ] ) in a somewhat weaker from , viz",
    ". _ models satisfying the rc necessarily have @xmath65 . _ therefore , spatially homogeneous cosmologies with @xmath66 violate the rc .",
    "this does not mean models with positive spatial curvature necessarily satisfy the rc , since they have to meet the stronger condition ( [ d.4 ] ) , in cases where the shear is non - vanishing at the time of the bounce .",
    "however , for isotropic models , it is necessary and sufficient that the spatial curvature is positive .",
    "bianchi class a types ii , @xmath62 and viii all have negative spatial curvature , and for type i it is zero .",
    "type @xmath51 is negative or zero .",
    "hence all these cases violate the rc , by virtue of the above argument .",
    "type ix violates the rc for cases in which the spatial curvature is negative or zero .    in class b ,",
    "since types iv , v , @xmath67 and @xmath52 have negative spatial curvature .",
    "bianchi iii is the special case of @xmath68 in bianchi @xmath67 , and the _ exceptional _ case bianchi @xmath69 has @xmath70 .",
    "they all violate the rc .",
    "recent ideas in string and m -theory @xcite have led to the notion that gravity could be a higher dimensional theory , that becomes 4-dimensional at low energies . in the randall - sundrum scenario",

    "<S> many cosmological scenarios envisage either a bounce of the universe at early times , or collapse of matter locally to form a black hole which reexpands into a new expanding universe region . </S>",
    "<S> energy conditions preclude this happening for ordinary matter in general relativistic universes , but scalar or dilatonic fields can violate some of these conditions , and so could possibly provide bounce behaviour . in this paper we show that such bounces can not occur in kantowskisachs models without violating the _ reality condition _ @xmath0 . </S>",
