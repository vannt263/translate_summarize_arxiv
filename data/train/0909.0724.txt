    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) tau decays provide one of the most efficient indirect tests of supersymmetric ( susy ) models with extended neutrino sector , if the seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation is implemented . here",
    "we assume susy - seesaw models with the mssm particle content plus three right handed neutrinos , @xmath4 @xmath5 , and their corresponding susy partners , @xmath6 , and use the parameterisation for the yukawa couplings given by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 defined by three complex angles @xmath9 ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 gev ; @xmath12 denotes the three light neutrino masses , and @xmath13 the three heavy ones . with this parameterisation",
    "it is easy to accommodate the @xmath14 data and also get large @xmath15 , by choosing large @xmath16 and/or @xmath9 .",
    "the sensitivity to the higgs sector of these susy - seesaw models can appear only via the lfv processes that are mediated by higgs particles .",
    "this is the case of the tau decay channels considered here , whose present experimental bounds are respectively at br@xmath17 , br@xmath18 , br@xmath19 and br@xmath20 ( assuming br@xmath21 ) .",
    "the interest of these channels is that for scenarios with heavy susy soft masses of the order of 1 tev , where the predicted rates for the @xmath22 channel lay below the present experimental bound , br@xmath23 , still some of the higgs - mediated processes can indeed be at the present experimental reach if the relevant higgs mass is light enough , say of the order of 100 - 250 gev .",
    "we will focus here in the type of constrained susy - seesaw scenarios called nuhm - seesaw ( standing for non universal higgs mass ) where this kind of spectrum with light higgs and heavy susy particles is possible .",
    "the input parameters are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xmath27 , sign(@xmath28 ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite the proper choices of @xmath31 and @xmath32 leading to the wanted light higgs sector can be found .",
    "notice that @xmath33 corresponds to the usual constrained model ( cmssm - seesaw ) with all scalar masses being universal , but this model does not lead to the scenario with heavy susy and light higgs particles that we are interested here , so we will not considered it next .",
    "most of the results reported here are extracted from the works  @xcite and  @xcite to which we refer the reader for more details .",
    "the numerical results for the branching ratios of the studied lfv tau decays are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : allbr ] .",
    "they are full one loop results and do not make use of any approximation like the mass insertion , large @xmath34 , nor the leading logarithmic approximations .",
    "the mass spectra for all the involved particles in the loops that contribute to these processes are computed within the nuhm - seesaw model , by solving the rges also to one loop level . in the case of the semileptonic",
    "decays we have used the standard techniques in chiral theory to describe the final hadrons in terms of quark bilinears . in particular , the channels with pseudo goldstone bosons ( pgb ) , @xmath35 , like @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are treated within chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath39pt ) to leading order , @xmath40 , where the results are given in terms of @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 .",
    "the additional contributions from resonances , @xmath8 , in channels of the type @xmath43 are taken into account within resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath39 t ) , where the results are given in terms of @xmath44 , @xmath42 , @xmath45 and well established form factors .",
    "in particular for the @xmath1 channel the contributions from the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are considered via the electromagnetic vector form factor , @xmath49 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath50 is defined via mixing between the octet , @xmath51 , and singlet , @xmath52 , components of the @xmath53 nonet of pgb in @xmath39pt .",
    "concretely we assume here a mixing angle of @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath55 is defined via mixing between the octet , @xmath56 , and singlet , @xmath57 , components of the @xmath58 nonet of resonances in r@xmath39 t .",
    "concretely we assume here two choices for this mixing angle , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "notice that we have selected the semileptonic channels where the final hadrons have a relevant strange quark content , and consequently the sensitivity to the higgs particles is greater than in those with just up and/or down quarks .    besides the total rates",
    ", we also show separately in fig .",
    "[ fig : allbr ] the various contributions to these processes : 1 ) @xmath0 can be mediated by a @xmath61 , a @xmath62 boson , boxes and @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65  @xcite , 2 ) @xmath1 by a @xmath61 ( also @xmath62 , but it is negligible ) and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , 3 ) @xmath66 by a z boson and @xmath65 , and 4 ) @xmath3 by @xmath63 and @xmath64 . we conclude that although the higgs contributions in all these processes grow very fast with @xmath27 , still at large @xmath27 values these are fairly dominated by the @xmath61 contribution in the cases of @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ". therefore , these are not sensitive to the higgs sector .",
    "we have checked that this is true even for a very heavy susy spectra where the @xmath61 contribution gets reduced considerably . in @xmath68",
    "the higgs contribution is relevant for @xmath69 gev , but there the rates are too small compared to the present bound . in contrast , the @xmath66 and @xmath3 channels are clearly sensitive to the higgs sector . in fig .  [",
    "fig : allbr ] we see that the @xmath65 contribution dominates br(@xmath66 ) for @xmath70 and the @xmath64 contribution dominates br(@xmath3 ) at all @xmath27 values .",
    "we also conclude from this figure that the approximate formulas found in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for large @xmath27 , whose simplest forms are given by , @xmath71   { \\rm br}(\\tau \\to \\mu f_0(980))_{{\\rm approx } }     & = & \\ ! \\ ! \\ !",
    "\\left ( \\ !   \\begin{array}{c } 7.3 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\ , ( \\theta_s=7^\\circ )   \\\\   4.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\ , ( \\theta_s=30^\\circ )   \\end{array } \\ ! \\ !",
    "\\right )   \\left| \\delta_{32 } \\right|^2     \\left ( \\frac{100 } { m_{h^0}({\\rm gev } ) } \\right)^4 \\left ( \\frac{\\tan \\beta}{60 } \\right)^6   \\ ! \\ ! ,    \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provide a very good approximation to the full result .",
    "this is also shown in fig.[fig : breta - brf0-mh ] where br(@xmath66 ) and br(@xmath72 ) are displayed as a function of the relevant higgs mass .",
    "we see clearly in this figure that these two channels are sensitive to masses within the range 100 - 250 gev , for large @xmath27 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "finally , fig.[fig : final ] illustrates several examples for the relevant parameter @xmath75 that meassures approximately the size of the lfv in the tau - mu sector in seesaw scenarios with a ) hierarchical and b ) degenerate heavy neutrinos @xmath76 .",
    "we see that in both scenarios values as large as @xmath77 can be obtained .",
    "therefore , with such large values and the present experimental upper limits one can extract lower bounds for the relevant higgs mass and upper bounds for @xmath27 .",
    "this is the main conclusion of this work .",
    "the case of @xmath3 is illustrated in the last plot of fig.[fig : final ] , where one can see the excluded regions in the @xmath78 plane .",
