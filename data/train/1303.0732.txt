    "on may 7 , 2012 , a remarkable article appeared in _ physical review letters_. @xcite the author , masud mansuripur , claimed to offer  incontrovertible theoretical evidence of the incompatibility of the lorentz [ force ] law with the fundamental tenets of special relativity , \" and concluded that  the lorentz law must be abandoned . \"",
    "the lorentz law , @xmath0\\ ] ] tells us the force * f * on a charge @xmath1 moving with velocity * v * through electric and magnetic fields * e * and * b*. together with maxwell s equations , it is the foundation on which all of classical electrodynamics rests .",
    "if it is incorrect , 150 years of theoretical physics is in serious jeopardy .",
    "such a provocative proposal was bound to attract attention . _",
    "@xcite published a full - page commentary , and within days several rebuttals were posted .",
    "@xcite critics pointed out that since the lorentz force law can be embedded in a manifestly covariant formulation of electrodynamics , it is guaranteed to be consistent with special relativity,@xcite and and some of them identified the specific source of mansuripur s error : neglect of  hidden momentum . \"",
    "nearly a year later _ physical review letters _ published four rebuttals , @xcite and _ science _ printed a follow - up article declaring the  purported relativity paradox resolved . \"",
    "@xcite    mansuripur s argument is based on a  paradox \" that was explored in this journal by victor namias and others @xcite many years ago : a magnetic dipole moving through an electric field can experience a torque , with no accompanying rotation . in section ii",
    "we introduce mansuripur s version of the paradox , in simplified form , and explain namias s resolution .",
    "the latter is based on a  gilbert \" model of the dipole ( separated magnetic monopoles ) ; it does not work for the ( realistic )  ampre \" model ( a current loop ) . for amperian dipoles",
    "the resolution involves ",
    "hidden \" momentum , so in section iii we discuss the physical nature of this often - misunderstood phenomenon . mansuripur himself treated the dipole as the point limit of a magnetized object , so in section iv we repeat the calculations in that context ( for both models ) , and confirm our earlier results . in section",

    "the torque on * m * is ( obviously ) zero .",
    "now examine the same configuration in @xmath5 ( the  lab \" frame ) , with respect to which @xmath2 moves at constant speed @xmath6 in the @xmath7 direction ( fig .  1 ) . in @xmath5",
    "the ( moving ) point charge generates electric and magnetic fields @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , and the ( moving ) magnetic dipole acquires an electric dipole moment @xcite @xmath11    the torque on the dipole is @xmath12 ( by lorentz transformation , @xmath13 ; the magnetic contribution is zero , because * b * vanishes on the @xmath7 axis ) .",
    "the torque is zero in one inertial frame , but _",
    "non_-zero in the other !",
    "mansuripur concludes that the lorentz force law ( on which eq .  5 is predicated ) is inconsistent with special relativity .",
    "-.2in[.7 ] -.7 in    this  paradox \" was resolved years ago by victor namias .",
    "@xcite the standard torque formulas ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) apply to dipoles _ at rest _ , but they do not hold , in general , for dipoles in motion .",
    "suppose we model the magnetic dipole as separated monopoles ( fig .",
    "the  lorentz force law \" for a magnetic monopole @xmath16 reads @xcite @xmath17,\\ ] ] so the torque @xcite on a moving dipole @xmath18 is @xmath19 but @xmath20 , so @xmath21 there is a third term , missing in eq .  5 , which ( it is easy to check ) exactly cancels the offending torque ; the net torque is zero in both frames .",
    "namias believed that his formula ( eq .  7 ) applies just as well to an ampre dipole as it does to a gilbert dipole .",
    "he was mistaken .",
    "an ampre dipole in an electric field carries  hidden \" momentum , @xcite @xmath22 because it is crucial in understanding the resolution to mansuripur s paradox , we pause to review the derivation of this formula , in a simple model .",
    "imagine a rectangular loop of wire carrying a steady current .",
    "picture the current as a stream of noninteracting positive charges that move freely within the wire .",
    "@xcite when a uniform electric field * e * is applied ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the charges accelerate up the left segment , and decelerate down the right one . _",
    "question : _ what is the total momentum of all the charges in the loop ?",
    "the left and right segments cancel , so we need only consider the top and bottom .",
    "say there are @xmath23 charges in the top segment , going to the right at speed @xmath24 , and @xmath25 charges in the lower segment , going at ( slower ) speed @xmath26 to the left .",
    "the _ current _ ( @xmath27 ) is the same in all four segments ( otherwise charge would be piling up somewhere ) .",
    "thus @xmath28 where @xmath1 is the charge of each particle , and @xmath29 is the length of the rectangle . _ classically , _ the momentum of a single particle is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is its mass , so the total momentum ( to the right ) is @xmath32 as one would certainly expect ( after all , the loop as a whole is not moving ) .",
    "but _ relativistically _ the momentum of a particle is @xmath33 , and we get @xmath34 which is _ not _ zero , because the particles in the upper segment are moving faster .",
    "in fact , the gain in energy ( @xmath35 ) , as a particle goes up the left side , is equal to the work done by the electric force , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the height of the rectangle , so @xmath38 now @xmath39 is the magnetic dipole moment of the loop ; as vectors , * m * points into the page and * p * is to the right , so @xmath40 this is the  hidden \" momentum in eq .",
    "-1.05in[.8 ] -.5 in    the term  hidden momentum \" was coined by shockley ; @xcite it was an unfortunate choice .",
    "the phenomenon itself was first studied in the context of static electromagnetic systems with nonzero field momentum ( @xmath41 ) . in such configurations",
    "the hidden momentum exactly cancels the field momentum ( @xmath42 ) , leaving a total of zero , as required by the  center of energy theorem . \"",
    "@xcite this has created the impression that hidden momentum is something artificial and ad hoc  invented simply to rescue an abstract theorem .",
    "@xcite nothing could be farther from the truth .",
    "hidden momentum is perfectly ordinary relativistic mechanical momentum , as the example above indicates ; it occurs in systems with internally moving parts , such as current - carrying loops , and it is  hidden \" only in the sense that it not associated with motion of the object as a whole .",
    "a _ gilbert _",
    "dipole in an electric field , having no moving parts , harbors _ no _ hidden momentum ( and the fields  with the crucial delta - function term in * b * included  carry no compensating momentum ) . @xcite    returning to the configuration in fig .  1 , the hidden momentum in @xmath2 is @xmath43 = -\\frac{qm_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^2d^2}\\,\\jhat.\\ ] ] because @xmath44 is perpendicular to * v * , and transverse components are unaffected by lorentz transformations , this is also the hidden momentum in @xmath45 .",
    "it is constant ( in time ) , so there is no associated force .",
    "but the hidden _ angular _ momentum , @xmath46 is _ not _ constant ( in the lab frame ) , because * r * is changing .",
    "in fact , @xmath47 this increase in angular momentum requires a torque , @xmath48 and this is precisely what we found in eq .",
    "recapitulating : _ in the gilbert model there is an extra term in the torque formula ( eq .  7 ) ; the total torque is zero , there is no hidden angular momentum , and nothing rotates . in the ampre model",
    "there is no third term in the torque formula ( eq .",
    "5)@xcite ; the torque is _ not _ zero , and drives the increasing hidden angular momentum  but still nothing rotates.@xcite it helps to separate the angular momentum into two types :  overt \" ( associated with actual rotation ) and  hidden \" ( so called because it is _ not _ associated with any overt rotation of the object ) .",
    "torque is the rate of change of the _ total _ angular momentum : @xmath49 in both models @xmath50 . in the gilbert model *",
    "n * and @xmath51 are also zero ; in the ampre model they are equal but non - zero .",
    "it is of interest to see how this plays out in mansuripur s formulation of the problem .",
    "he treats the dipole as magnetized medium , and calculates the torque directly from the lorentz force law , without invoking @xmath14 or @xmath15 . in the proper frame",
    ", he takes @xmath52 now , * m * and * p * constitute an antisymmetric second - rank tensor : @xmath53 and the transformation rule is @xcite @xmath54 ( for motion in the @xmath7 direction ) . in the present case , then , the polarization and magnetization in the  lab \" frame are @xmath55    according to the lorentz law , the force density is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the bound charge density and @xmath58 is the sum of the polarization current and the bound current density . using eqs .  2 , 3 , 21 , and 22 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath59 ( where a prime denotes the derivative ) . the net force on the dipole",
    "is @xmath60\\bigg|_{y=0}\\,\\khat =   { \\bf 0}.\\ ] ] meanwhile , the torque density is @xmath61 so the net torque on the dipole is @xmath62\\right\\}\\bigg|_{y=0}\\,\\ihat\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{qm_0v}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^2d^2}\\,\\ihat,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] confirming eq .",
    "this is the torque required to account for the increase in hidden angular momentum .",
    "what if we run mansuripur s calculation for a dipole made out of magnetic monopoles ?",
    "the bound charge , bound current , and magnetization current are @xcite @xmath63 so the force density on the magnetic dipole ( again invoking eqs .  2 , 3 , 21 , and 22 ) is@xcite @xmath64 the total force is again zero , but this time so too is the torque density ( @xmath65 ) , and hence the total torque . as before ,",
    "the torque is zero in the gilbert model  and there is no hidden angular momentum .",
    "having concluded that the lorentz force law is unacceptable , mansuripur proposes to replace eq .  24 with an expression based on the einstein ",
    "laub law : @xcite @xmath66\\,\\jhat.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total force on the dipole still vanishes : @xmath67\\bigg|_{z - vt = d/\\gamma}\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\bf 0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the torque density should be @xmath68 : @xmath69\\,\\ihat,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] giving a total torque @xmath70\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\frac{m_0qv}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^2 d^2}\\,\\ihat\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the derivative is again evaluated at @xmath71 ) .",
    "it s not zero ! in fact , it s _ minus _ the  lorentz \" torque , eq .",
    "but mansuripur argues that ,  to guarantee the conservation of angular momentum , [ eq .",
    "32 ] must be supplemented  \" @xmath72 in our case the extra terms are @xmath73 and their contribution to the total torque is @xmath74\\,dx\\,dy\\,dz = \\frac{m_0qv}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^2d^2}\\,\\ihat,\\ ] ] which is just right to cancel eq .",
    "33 , yielding a net torque of zero ( which mansuripur takes to be the correct answer ) .    what are we to make of this argument ?",
    "in the first place , the einstein  laub force density was derived assuming that the medium is at rest,@xcite which in this case it is not .",
    "more important , the magnetization terms implicitly assume a gilbert model for the magnetic dipole : @xmath75 as long as the magnetization is localized , the first two terms yield vanishing surface integrals , @xcite leaving @xmath76 $ ] for the net force density on the object , the same as in the gilbert model ( eq .  29 ) . @xcite there may be some contexts in which the einstein ",
    "laub force law is valid and useful , but this is not one of them .",
    "mansuripur is quite explicit in writing that the magnetic dipole he has in mind is  a small , charge neutral loop of current , \" which is to say , an ampre dipole .",
    "the resolution of mansuripur s  paradox \" depends on the model for the magnetic dipole :    * if it is a gilbert dipole ( made from magnetic monopoles ) , the third term in namias s formula ( eq .  7 ) supplies the missing torque . in mansuripur s formulation ( using a polarizable medium ) , it comes from a correct accounting of the bound charge / current ( eq .  28 ) .",
    "the net torque is zero in the lab frame , just as it is in the proper frame . *",
    "if it is an ampre dipole ( an electric current loop ) , the third term in namias s equation is absent , and the torque on the dipole is _ not _ zero .",
    "it is , however , just right to account for the increasing hidden angular momentum in the dipole .",
