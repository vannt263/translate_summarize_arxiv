    "recently , bicep2 collaboration has reported the detection of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) b - mode polarization at the degree scales at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the detected degree scale b - mode polarization is consistent with the primordial gravitational waves origin and the corresponding value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , which represents the amplitude of the primordial gravitational waves , is @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude of the primordial gravitational wave is a direct probe of the energy scale of the inflation , which is given by @xmath5 based on this result , there have appeared a number of interesting papers  @xcite .    however , there is a tension between bicep2 and planck results .",
    "the latter gives the upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio as @xmath6 obtained from the combined analysis of the cmb temperature fluctuations and other data sets  @xcite .",
    "the key point to resolve this discrepancy is a suppression of the scalar perturbations on large scales enough to compensate for the contribution from the large tensor modes . as an example , running spectral index is discussed in bicep2 paper and it is necessary to consider relatively large ( in terms of absolute value ) negative running such as @xmath7 to resolve the tension , which is much larger than the expected value in the standard slow - roll inflation model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors consider the anti - correlation between the scalar and tensor perturbations instead of the running spectral index .    in this paper",
    ", we alternatively consider the anti - correlated iso - curvature perturbation to compensate for the contribution of the large tensor modes  @xcite .",
    "such iso - curvature perturbations could be realized in the simple curvaton model which has both cold dark matter ( cdm ) and baryon isocurvature perturbations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show our basic idea of compensation for the tensor contribution with the iso - curvature perturbations . in section [ curvaton ] , in the context of the curvaton scenario we present a concrete model where the required iso - curvature perturbation could be realized , and",
    "we devote the final section to summary .",
    "in this section let us describe the basic idea . we focus on the compensation for the large tensor modes due to the iso - curvature perturbations . owing to the damping behavior of the tensor and iso - curvature perturbations , both perturbations give similar contributions to large scale temperature fluctuations . on large scales , the temperature anisotropy induced from scalar perturbation",
    "is mainly sourced from the sachs - wolfe effect as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the adiabatic curvature perturbation on uniform energy density slice during the radiation - dominated era , and @xmath10 is the total matter iso - curvature perturbations .",
    "the matter component consists of the cdm and baryons and hence we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively cdm and baryon iso - curvature perturbations , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 cdm , b , and m ) with @xmath16 is a density parameter of each component . as we have mentioned , the tensor perturbations also contribute the cmb temperature fluctuations . on large scales ,",
    "the tensor - contribution can be approximately written as  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a unit vector .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , including all contributions to the temperature anisotropies we obtain @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the power spectrum of each component , and @xmath22 is a cross - power spectrum of the adiabatic and iso - curvature perturbations . here",
    ", we also introduce parameters related with the iso - curvature perturbations as @xmath23 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) , to compensate for the tensor contribution with the iso - curvature perturbation , the following relation is required : @xmath24 to realize this requirement , we at least need anti - correlated iso - curvature perturbations , that is , @xmath25 , and with @xmath26 we obtain @xmath27 if we chose the bicep2 result , @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 or @xmath30 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using the wmap3 and other data sets the constraints on the value of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "hence , our naive estimation seems to be agreement with these constraints for @xmath35 .",
    "let us consider the concrete example which can realize the required anti - correlated iso - curvature perturbations as we have shown in the previous section . here",
    ", we consider the curvaton scenario  @xcite as the mechanism of generating the iso - curvature perturbations @xcite .    in the curvaton scenario ,",
    "the adiabatic curvature perturbations could be induced not only from the inflation fluctuations but also fluctuations of a light scalar field other than inflaton called as curvaton . the curvaton field which is subdominant component of the universe",
    "has acquired the fluctuations during inflation , and then starts to oscillate when the hubble parameter becomes equal to the mass of the field .",
    "such oscillating scalar field behaves as non - relativistic matter .",
    "hence , during radiation dominated era , the energy density of the curvaton becomes larger compared with the total energy density of the universe and simultaneously the adiabatic fluctuations also evolves due to the iso - curvature perturbations sourced from the curvaton fluctuations . finally ,",
    "after the curvaton decays the adiabatic curvature perturbations stay constant in time .",
    "the total adiabatic curvature perturbations after the curvaton decay is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a parameter related with the ratio between the curvaton and the radiation energy density at the curvaton decay , @xmath38 is the curvature perturbations induced from the inflaton fluctuations and @xmath39 is the curvaton iso - curvature perturbations which is given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the curvature perturbations on the uniform energy density slicing of the curvaton .    as for the residual iso - curvature perturbations , @xmath12 or @xmath13 , it depends on the generation process of the cdm and baryons . in the case",
    "where the cdm / baryons have been produced from the inflaton decay , the curvature perturbation on the uniform cdm / baryons energy density slice , @xmath42 , should be equal to @xmath38 and then the residual iso - curvature perturbations defined as @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 from this expression , we find that this case has the possibility of generating required anti - correlated iso - curvature perturbations . on the other hand , in the case where the cdm / baryons have been produced from the curvaton decay , we have @xmath45 and then the residual iso - curvature perturbations are given by @xmath46 in this case , it is difficult to realize the anti - correlated iso - curvature perturbations because of the fact that @xmath47",
    ".    let us focus on the former case and assume that both of cdm and baryons have been produced from the inflaton decay . in this case ,",
    "the parameters introduced in the previous section are respectively written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the ratio of the amplitude of @xmath39 to that of @xmath38 defined as @xmath50 . substituting the above expressions into the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) , we have @xmath51 since all parameters are positive definite , this case can not realize the required iso - curvature perturbations .",
    "as we have mentioned , in another case where both of cdm and baryons have been produced from the curvaton decay the expected residual iso - curvature perturbations can not be the required one .",
    "next , let us consider the mixed scenario where the cdm and baryons are sourced from the inflaton and curvaton decay , respectively . in such case",
    ", we have @xmath52 and the total matter iso - curvature perturbations are given by @xmath53 { \\mathcal s}_\\sigma .",
    "\\label{eq : compensated}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the parameter @xmath54 to be equal to @xmath55 , then the total matter iso - curvature perturbations is completely cancelled even as each component has the iso - curvature perturbations , so - called compensated iso - curvature perturbations @xcite . on the other hand , to realize the compensation for the large tensor mode with the iso - curvature perturbation we do not need completely compensated iso - curvature perturbations but the partially compensated ones . by using the above expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : compensated ] ) , we have @xmath56 substituting the above expression into the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) , we have @xmath57 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig ] , we can easily find that the above equation has solutions for large @xmath49 case .    ) in @xmath54-@xmath49 plane.,width=415 ]    in the limiting case where the curvaton contribution dominates over the adiabatic perturbations , that is , @xmath58 , for the planck best - fit values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 and the bicep2 value of @xmath32 , that is , @xmath61 and @xmath28 , we find that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are solutions for eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) .",
    "hence , in such case we can realize the required iso - curvature perturbations to compensate for the tensor contribution to the temperature anisotropies , which makes the bicep2 result consistent with the planck result .",
    "an intuitive understanding of the need of the compensated isocurvature perturbations is as follows . in the simpler scenarios where all of the cdm and baryons come from either only the curvaton , or only the inflaton , the contributions from the curvaton fluctuations to the adiabatic perturbations and the matter iso - curvature perturbations are almost same , which are characterized by a single parameter @xmath54 .",
    "however , to realize the required iso - curvature perturbations in the light of bicep2 and planck , it should be necessary to consider the larger contribution to the adiabatic perturbations than that to the matter iso - curvature perturbations . by considering the partially compensated situation",
    ", we can introduce a new parameter related with the ratio between the energy density of the cdm and that of the baryon , and the contribution to the iso - curvature parameter depends on not only @xmath54 but also the new parameter @xmath64 .",
    "hence , to choose appropriate values of these parameters we can realize the case with the larger contribution to the adiabatic perturbations than that to the matter iso - curvature perturbations .    as is well - known , although the parameter @xmath54 is an important parameter to describe the primordial non - gaussianity and it is strongly constrained as @xmath65  @xcite , this constraint is consistent with the required values @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we would like to note that the bicep2 result basically indicates that even if we consider the curvaton scenario we hardly neglect the inflaton contribution due to the large tensor - to - scalar ratio  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig ] , for minimum @xmath49 , we can also have a solution at @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "for these parameters , the ratio @xmath68 of the power spectra of the curvature perturbations from the inflaton to the curvaton is given by @xmath69 [ see , eq .",
    "( [ eq : curv_pert ] ) ] and hence we can realize the required iso - curvature fluctuations in case where the the curvaton contributions are only @xmath70 of the inflaton contributions . the slow - roll parameter @xmath71 ( @xmath72:hubble during inflation ) should be large to suppress the inflaton contribution , which leads to red - tilted spectral index of the curvaton perturbations . ]",
    "we find that the required iso - curvature perturbations can be also realized for the opposite case , that is , the case where cdm and baryons are sourced from the curvaton and inflaton decay , respectively . in such case ,",
    "the solution can be obtained for relatively large @xmath54 and small @xmath49 .",
    "for example , we have a solution for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and this means @xmath75 .",
    "hence , in this case we can also realize the required situation by considering only @xmath70 curvaton contributions .",
    "recent bicep2 report about the detection of the degree - scale cmb b - mode polarization has revealed the energy scale of the inflation and opened a window into the deep understanding of the physics of the early universe .",
    "however there still exist a tension between the bicep2 result @xmath0 and planck result @xmath76 from the observations of the cmb temperature fluctuations . in order to resolve this discrepancy",
    ", we need to consider the suppression of the large scale scalar perturbations . in this paper , instead of considering the large negative running discussed in the bicep2 paper , we consider the anti - correlated iso - curvature perturbations .",
    "we present a concrete example to realize the required anti - correlated iso - curvature perturbations in the context of the curvaton scenario .",
    "we just show the possibility by using the rough estimate and hence it should be interesting to perform more detailed analysis by using e.g. , markov chain monte carlo methods .",
    "we leave such detailed analysis as a future issue .",
