    "the wave speed has a complex radial dependence , featuring a constant pattern speed for the dominant @xmath4=2 structure out to 1.2 - 1.8 kpc ( depending on the disk mass assumed ) , followed by a superposition of structures described by a pattern speed that decreases with radius , down to @xmath310 - 20 @xmath5 by @xmath34.6 kpc .",
    "+ knowledge of the pattern speed of the structure can , in principle , both distinguish between and reconcile the short- and long - lived wave scenarios , and so many studies have focused on measuring and characterizing this parameter ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for example ) .",

    "the radial modification of the tw method ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter m08 ) delivers a derivation for radially - dependent pattern speeds measurable from observationally accessible quantities .",
    "the so - called twr calculation proceeds under assumptions parallel to those of the original method , namely that the disk of the galaxy is flat ( unwarped ) ; that the surface density of a disk component , which must obey continuity , becomes negligibly small at some radius and all azimuths within the map boundary ( thereby critically yielding converged integrals ; see below ) ; and that the relation between the emission from this component and its surface density is linear , or if not , suspected deviations from linearity can be modeled .",
    "+ departure from the traditional method ( which assumes that the disk contains a single , well - defined rigidly rotating pattern ) emerges by allowing that @xmath6=@xmath9  and the surface density of the tracer @xmath10 .",

    "+ when the integral on the left of equation ( [ eq : volt ] ) is replaced with a discrete quadrature for different values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( represented in figure 1 of m08 ) , equation ( [ eq : volt ] ) takes the form of the matrix expression @xmath22 with @xmath23 an upper triangular @xmath24 square matrix .",
    "this can be solved numerically for a total of two independent measures of @xmath9 , one from either side of the galaxy ( y@xmath250 and y@xmath260 ) . + as described by @xcite ( and depicted in figure 2 of m08 ) , solving equation [ eq : twr ] by standard back - substitution results in the propagation of errors from large radii inward , whereby solutions inescapably display noisy oscillations .",
    "as demonstrated there , applied first to sb galaxy ngc 1068 , this effect can be impeded most simply by adopting a relatively large bin width ; the twr solution in this case is found to decrease with radius , and yield a winding time estimate for the two - armed structure . +",
    "but in general , as found in application to simulations ( m08 ) , smaller radial bins are preferable to insure accurate assessment of radial variation .",
    "in addition , noisy behavior in solutions tends to be amplified when the quadrature extends out to the edge of the surface brightness ( a requirement argued for by m08 ) , which not least imposes that the outermost bins generally cover the lowest s / n regions in the disk . combined with a relatively small bin , numerical solutions as a result of inward error propagation display a systematic offset in each bin between measurement and the actual value , preventing accurate determination of @xmath9 ( m08 ) . +",
    "as shown in m08 , regularization provides an effective means of reducing the intrinsic propagation of noise in solutions while maintaining the precision required to accurately identify true radial variation .",
    "there , regularized twr calculations were applied successfully to simulated disks featuring multiple pattern speeds in distinct radial zones as well as spiral winding .",
    "+ following m08 , then , we introduce a regularizing operator , or smoothing functional @xmath27 , containing a priori information in the manner of tikhonov - miller regularization ( @xcite ; @xcite ) into the @xmath28 estimator minimized by solutions @xmath29 of equation ( [ eq : twr ] ) , whereby minimization returns smoothed solutions according to ( in matrix form ) @xmath30 where the elements of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ( with errors @xmath35 representing the measurement error of the @xmath36 data point @xmath37 ) , and the parameter @xmath38 controls the degree of smoothness achieved in solutions .",
    "details for the full calculation and analysis can be found in m08 ; we proceed by highlighting only a few of the main precepts . + by incorporating simple expectations from theory and observation into the smoothing @xmath27 , the solution of equation [ eq : twrreg ] yields smoothed , testable models for @xmath9 .",
    "these models we restrict to simple forms and consider only polynomial solutions with constant , linear and quadratic radial dependence .",
    "( the elements of the smoothing @xmath27 are associated with the minimization of the @xmath39 derivative of @xmath40 for each polynomial solution of order @xmath41 . )",
    "these polynomial models can be incorporated into step - functions which parameterize the radial domains of multiple pattern speeds ( see m08 ) .",
    "+ the best fit global solution constructed from the average of like - model solutions from the two sides is established using the standard @xmath42 ( @xmath28 per degree of freedom ) statistic , as in m08 .",
    "( note that an explicit assumption here is that all patterns in the disk are indeed global . ) to summarize , once equation ( [ eq : twrreg ] ) is solved with a set of prescribed smoothings on each side , we use equation ( [ eq : twr ] ) to generate a complete set of @xmath26@xmath43@xmath44 for each global model .",

    ", we adopt the uniform weighting scheme advocated by m08 .",
    "+ according to the m08 prescription where measurement errors for each slice reflect random noise in the data , for this analysis we assign errors @xmath47 that define the change in the measured @xmath26@xmath43@xmath25 introduced by a change in the chosen flux cut - off in the first moment map .",
    "specifically , the error in the @xmath26@xmath43@xmath25 measured from a map with an @xmath48 level cutoff is defined as @xmath49^{1/2}\\ ] ] for each slice @xmath50 .",
    "the average of the individual errors then define the global measurement error across the entire disk where @xmath46=@xmath51/2n ( and @xmath52 is the number of bins / slices used in the twr calculation on a single side ) .",
    "( note that this error relates to the error @xmath35 for each slice in equation ( [ eq : twrreg ] ) through @xmath53 . )",
    "+ although these random errors are used in the goodness - of - fit criterion , the overall error in the measurement of @xmath9 given by the best - fit global model solution is defined relative to systematic errors in the calculation . uncertainty in the assumed position angle ( pa ) , for example",
    ", has the largest potential for introducing errors into @xmath26@xmath43@xmath45 , or conversely , the @xmath37 in equation ( [ eq : twrreg ] ) , and is the dominant source of error in tw calculations ( @xcite ; m08 ) .",
    "we assess this error by testing the sensitivity of the solutions to departures from the nominal value for the pa ( or inclination , for instance ) .",
    "unless otherwise specified , in this paper all reported error bars reflect the influence of pa uncertainty alone . as for inclination errors , apart from the change introduced in the pattern speed measurements through a change in @xmath54 , these prove to be of little additional consequence to the accurate placement of radial bins defined in the quadrature ( as suggested by m08 ) , despite the relatively low inclination ( we adopt @xmath16=24@xmath0 ; see table [ tab - params ] ) of the disk of m51 .",
    "we therefore do not report this error , but instead note that a change in the inclination by @xmath55=@xmath23@xmath0 corresponds to a fractional variation of about 12@xmath56 in the pattern speed estimates reported here .",
    "in this paper , we consider the disk of m51 traced by high resolution co observations .",
    "as described in its initial publication @xcite , the cube consists of the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( song ) observation together with several additional pointings which extend the map out to @xmath57@xmath3280  and provide higher angular resolution in the central regions ( see the beginning of @xmath7 [ sec : quad ] ) .",
    "a complete description of the data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the 2-@xmath58 zeroth and first moment maps used in this analysis , derived from the full cube , are shown in figure [ fig - mom0 ] .",
    "measurement errors given by uncertainty in the flux - cutoff are defined relative to maps at the 1- and 3-@xmath58 levels .",
    "the measured intensities and velocities in figure [ fig - mom0 ] are suitable for use with the twr method provided that the assumptions listed in the previous section are satisfied . while the continuity requirement can be particularly limiting , @xcite and @xcite argue that co emission , the standard tracer of the molecular component of the ism , suitably meets the tw assumptions for galaxies where the ism is everywhere dominated by molecular gas .",
    "this is founded on the low true efficiency of star formation in spirals , which implies that only a small fraction of molecular gas is converted into stars on orbital timescales , while molecular dominance implies that the conversion of molecular hydrogen into other phases of the ism occurs at low levels .",
    "+ @xcite applied the tw method under this premise , showing with co and hi observations that the gas content of m51 is in fact dominated by molecular hydrogen where co is detected .",
    "the co observations used in this work can be similarly asserted to obey continuity : assuming a conversion factor between co intensity and h@xmath59 column density @xmath60=2@xmath6110@xmath62@xmath63 k km s@xmath64^{-1}$ ] , molecular hydrogen is found dominant over the majority of the co emitting disk ( roughly @xmath65@xmath26105  ) , where n(h@xmath59)/n(h1)@xmath310 @xcite .",
    "+ the possibility of variation in the co - h@xmath59 conversion factor has also been addressed by @xcite , who find in a series of tests applied to m51 that neither a linear relationship between metallicity and @xmath60-factor nor arm - interarm variations at levels suggested by @xcite produce a significant change in the derived pattern speed estimate .",
    "+ the negligible effect of radial dependence in @xmath60 can be largely attributed to the cancellation of axisymmetry with tw integration along each slice ( see @xcite for a complete account ) .",
    "analogously , for the twr method , as long as the metallicity changes negligibly over the width of a radial bin , we can expect little change in the results of calculations that assume an approximately constant @xmath60-factor throughout the disk .",
    "we have confirmed this to be the case here ; modeled according to the @xcite metallicity gradient 0.02 dex kpc@xmath66 , an increase in @xmath60 with radius produces negligible change in the measured solutions .",
    "+ an arm - interarm contrast as suggested by @xcite , on the other hand , in general may not so readily translate from tw to twr calculations inconsequentially .",
    "currently , assessing the particular effect of azimuthal variation in the @xmath60 factor on the results of the twr method is beyond the scope of this work . here , we rely on the results of @xcite to assert that , to a first approximation , variation in @xmath60 should not compromise the analysis as presented here .",

    "this corresponds to the limiting resolution ( @xmath34  ) of the map at the innermost radii . since with the majority of our analysis of m51 we are most interested in characterizing the pattern speeds of the bright spiral structure",
    ", this choice is expected to yield high quality solutions for the pattern speeds in this region in particular .",
    "+ at the largest radii ( and in interarm regions ) the resolution decreases to 6-13  @xcite .",
    "though in principle the quadrature can accommodate a non - uniform bin width , we maintain @xmath72=0.23 kpc throughout the disk and rely instead on the allocation of information administered by regularization .",
    "we assert that , even with our 4.5  radial bins , regularized twr calculations are prevented from oversampling the data as long as any distinct regions parameterized by the models are larger than the resolution . +",
    "as assessed in m08 , we can expect departures from the nominal values of the parameters appearing in equation [ eq : twr ] to introduce non - negligible errors into the twr solutions .",
    "uncertainty in the major axis pa is the dominant source of systematic error in the calculation , resulting in errors on the order of 20% in twr pattern speeds ( m08 ) .",
    "since the kinematic parameters of m51 are notoriously difficult to constrain , perhaps the greatest challenge to the accuracy of our solutions lies in the the accuracy with which we can constrain the quadrature .",
    "+ to best equip the analysis in this capacity , then , we survey both our own derivations of the kinematic parameters and those from the literature . for the coordinates of the center of rotation and the disk inclination angle , for example , we rely on the values from the study of @xcite .",
    "these we then adopt in fits of a tilted ring model to the co velocity field with the groningen image processing system ( gipsy ) program rotcur to determine the systemic velocity and the kinematic line of nodes ( as well as the rotation velocity as a function of radius ) .",
    "the resulting parameters ( listed in table [ tab - params ] ) are consistent with most previous determinations . note , however , that rather than adopting the range of pas ( 170@xmath74to 180@xmath0 ) considered by @xcite , we initially choose pa=170@xmath0@xmath25@xmath0 .",
    "this is principally in order that our results are more easily compared with the majority of studies on m51 , especially those which entail estimates for the pattern speed .",
    "additionally , for this study we assume d=9.5 mpc ; with the alternative d=7.7 mpc ( more common to recent studies ) , all distances reported here decrease by a factor of @xmath30.2 , while all pattern speeds reciprocally increase .",
    "+ according to the arguments in m08 , we extend the unique quadrature established with the values in table [ tab - params ] out to the map boundary @xmath2@xmath75 in order to insure that all information critical for characterizing the patterns of interest is accounted for . since the emission extends ( roughly east / west ) out to @xmath2@xmath75=145  , this defines the maximum radial extent of the quadrature @xmath76/@xmath77=7.3 kpc , and hence the limit of integration along each slice @xmath2@xmath78=@xmath79 .",
    "though this does place @xmath80 within the edge of the emission at small @xmath81 ( given the elongated emission in this map from n to s and the low disk inclination ) , the radial range of the quadrature is still comfortably outside the radius where the integrals converge .",
    "+ as diagnosed by m08 , with this fairly extensive quadrature solutions @xmath9 are at risk of regularization - induced bias .",
    "this bias is defined for the particular case when bins cover a region that displays only faint emission , has little information from a strong pattern , or is suspected of sustaining multiple patterns ; when these bins are prescribed an unrealistic model , the accuracy of the remainder of the solution can be jeopardized .",
    "+ evidence for regions in the outer disk of m51 susceptible to regularization - induced bias are identifiable a priori in the intensity map and its fourier power spectrum .",
    "later in @xmath7 [ sec : inneronly ] where we address this bias and its signatures , we adopt the counter - measure developed by m08 wherein the compromised bins are calculated without regularization .",
    "this imposes the additional parameterization of a cut radius @xmath82 on our model solutions , interior to which regularization proceeds as defined in equation [ eq : twrreg ] .",
    "( see m08 for a description of the calculation and analysis in this case . ) in practice , we unregularize only as long as we can insure the sustained effectiveness of regularization in the rest of the calculation , given that an increased number of unregularized bins promotes the reintroduction of unamendable propagating noise . + in order to test for the possibility of multiple pattern speeds and/or winding , models additionally parameterize either single or multiple distinct radial domains over which the solution can vary as zeroth , first or second order polynomials . though in general we test all possible models at each stage of the analysis , in some cases we restrict our consideration to only those polynomials for which the degree of freedom plus 3 - 4 bins does not exceed the number of bins in a given domain .",
    "as in previous applications of the method , we make use of a priori information to develop physically motivated models for @xmath9 . and as with all such models , in order that they supply rigorous estimates we must also account for evidence suggesting susceptibility to regularization - induced bias . in the surface brightness ( figure [ fig - mom0 ] ) and its fourier decomposition ( figure [ fig - fourier ] ) we identify a region outside @xmath57@xmath34 kpc , in particular , where both the surface brightness and power in the @xmath4=2 component are low , an indication that the information to be extracted there is potentially unreliable and difficult to constrain through modeling .",
    "+ this is manifest in solutions for which regularization is employed throughout the full extent of the emission",
    ". bins at large radii in the lowest-@xmath28 solutions exhibit a significant degree of variation in their modeling , confirming that constraining the outer pattern speed is difficult . according to the conclusion drawn by m08 in tests of the regularized twr calculation on simulations , this challenges the accuracy with which all inner bins can realize the true pattern speed .",
    "we therefore initially consider models which parameterize a cut radius @xmath82=4.1 kpc , beyond which all bins are calculated without regularization . in testing",
    ", we find this cut radius to coincide with a clear minimum in the @xmath28 , with all other best - fit parameters held fixed .",
    "+ a second , shallower minimum at @xmath82=5.3 kpc is also compelling , and we consider its parameterization in models of @xmath9 in the analysis that follows , as well",
    ". this location may well be reasonable for the separation of the patterns given that it seems to match expectations for the location where the outer , material pattern begins .",
    "we cite in particular the study of @xcite who , like @xcite , argue that olr occurs at the termination of the bright , inner spiral structure and in the pretext of mode - coupling therein identify an overlap between the cr of the inner pattern with the ilr of a 10 - 20 @xmath5 outer pattern ( e.g. that first proposed for the material pattern by @xcite ) .",
    "this places the the innermost extent of the material pattern at @xmath57@xmath36.0 kpc ( adopted into the distance convention used here ) .",
    "@xcite also argue for a similar corotation radius based on observations of streaming motions in the ionized gas component of the ism . and",
    "while this does not locate the inner extent of the outer pattern , it nevertheless implies that the outer arms are separate from , and have a lower pattern speed than , the inner arms @xcite .",

    "rather than furnish a description for arms that are material and winding , however , we note that the very alignment of multiple pattern speeds with the disk angular rotation may relate to an underlying mechanism governing the existence and maintenance of structure in the disk . in one interpretation",

    "for example , although their range of applicability seems limited to the innermost radii ( but taken as an approximation to the best - fit multi - speed solutions ) the bin values in the current set of quadratic solutions are much closer to the angular rotation of the disk than @xmath102 , near which much of the @xmath4=2 structure in the models of @xcite achieves its greatest amplitude .",

    "the inner disk of m51 has been suggested to sustain radial variation in the pa @xcite and an additional @xmath4=3 mode @xcite , both of which undeniably challenge the authenticity of the twr solutions , and so we address the possible influence of each of these in turn .",
    "though perhaps unexpected , the identification of a transition between two pattern speeds in the inner disk seems supported by independent studies of the bright spiral structure .",

    "we review the particular possibility that weak @xmath4=3 structure identified by @xcite out to @xmath32.5 kpc contributes with a unique pattern speed to out twr solutions . + only if all structures in the same radial zone have identical pattern speeds will the twr calculation accurately reflect this sole speed ; given a surface brightness distribution which reflects two coincident contributions ( say , from @xmath4=2 and @xmath4=3 structures ) with unique time dependence ( i.e. different pattern speeds ) , the twr calculation is currently unequipped to constrain either one or the other .",
    "though a generalization can be made under the assumption that both pattern speeds are constant , it is beyond the scope of this work to develop either the tw or twr calculation appropriate to the situation . + for m51 , it may be possible in the future to directly relate the velocity asymmetry from arm to arm of the bright @xmath4=2 spiral structure identified by @xcite to the presence of the @xmath4=3 mode , and to its pattern speed in particular .",
    "( @xcite have already successfully demonstrated that the presence of the @xmath4=3 mode induces a systematic offset in the azimuthal positions of the two main arms ) .",
    "this should allow us to establish the expected combination of speeds in the twr calculation ; if the implied @xmath4=3 pattern speed is unlike the measure @xmath98 found with pa=170@xmath0 , for example , this speed is presumably unshared by the @xmath4=2 structure .",
    "in this paper we present regularized twr solutions for the pattern speed of the bright spiral structure in the inner disk of m51 , derived with velocity and intensity information from the ism - dominant molecular component traced by high - resolution co observations .",
    "these solutions are arrived at by isolating the inner disk from errors which evidently originate with both the quality of sampling / detection and the pattern speed - modeling in bins covering the outer , material pattern .",
    "so although our procedure prevents us from constraining the outermost pattern speed , calculating the outer bins without regularization in principle improves the accuracy with which the solution for the inner disk can realize the true pattern speed .",
    "+ our primary result with this implementation is the measurement inside 4 kpc of two pattern speeds , both significantly higher , and together fitting the data better , than the constant global measure of @xcite at the nominal pa=170@xmath0",
    ". a third , lower pattern speed , extending beyond 4 kpc out to ( at least ) 5.3 kpc is also detected , nearer the speed expected for the material pattern .",
    "significantly , the transitions between the measured pattern speeds coincide with resonances ; the two pattern speeds inside 4 kpc both end at corotation within the uncertainties .",
    "since it is in no way imposed by the method , this dynamically reasonable scenario tends to give us confidence as to the physical plausibility of the pattern speeds returned by the analysis .",
    "+ of course , given that a pattern speed interior to @xmath57@xmath852 kpc is only weakly detected ( if at all ) at pa=175@xmath0 , the accuracy of the description provided by two pattern speeds may depend on whether pa=170@xmath0 or pa=175@xmath0 is more accurate , an uncertainty raised by @xcite , for instance .",
    "if the disk is best described with pa=175@xmath0 , we find evidence that a single constant pattern speed inside 4 kpc best characterizes the bright spiral structure . furthermore , as contemplated in @xmath7 [ sec : varypa ] , a radially varying pa which decreases from 180@xmath0 ( and reaches 170@xmath0 near 3 kpc ) , perhaps suggested by the results of @xcite , also favors a single measured pattern speed interior to 4 kpc .",
    "+ again , however , while the analysis presented here can not resolve the question as to which pa is more appropriate , we find meaningful , independent evidence in favor of the pattern speeds measured at 170@xmath0 , in particular .",
    "for example , consistent with expectations of leading structure at the inner most radii ( as in the observations of @xcite ) , the higher speed inside @xmath57@xmath852 kpc lacks an ilr .",
    "in addition , attendant to our finding that both speeds interior to 4 kpc terminate at corotation , the transition between the two roughly coincides with an inferred location of resonance overlap wherein the inner s corotation resonance and the outer s inner 4:1 resonance align .",
    "the radial domain of the pattern speed measured at pa=175@xmath0 , in contrast , is not as clearly associated with resonance radii .",
    "since the bright spiral structure does not appear along the minor axis near @xmath32 kpc , the corotation resonance at this location implied by the solution at 170@xmath0 is unfortunately unconfirmable through inspection of radial streaming velocities under the density wave interpretation .",
    "+ we also find remarkable agreement between the characteristics of the two speeds inside 4 kpc at pa=170@xmath0 and other evidence in the inner disk consistent with multiple pattern speeds .",
    "the transition parameterized in our best - fit solution for the inner disk coincides with significant variation in the two - armed spiral pitch angle .",
    "since a change in the pitch angle is expected to be accompanied by a change in streaming motions , both parameters are presumably attendant to the signatures ( streaming or otherwise ) of the patterns .",
    "+ although the pattern speed interior to 2 kpc in the solution at 170@xmath0 ( or 175@xmath0 ) may reflect a unique contribution from the @xmath4=3 mode observed by @xcite , as described in @xmath7 [ sec : discussion ] , the measurements in figure [ fig - globalcut9a ] ( or figure [ fig - twfit175bestc14 ] ) presumably directly relate to the patterns present in the disk and so ( depending on the pa ) should provide a fair description of the dynamics therein . as such , it may be possible that ensuing observations and studies better discriminate between the two seemingly disparate radial dependencies implied for the pas considered here .",
    "+ even at present our twr solutions yield interpretations with which to observationally address the question of spiral longevity . that the solutions at both 170@xmath0 and 175@xmath0 feature constant pattern speeds would imply that our solutions are indicative of long - lasting spiral structure .",
    "interestingly , at the innermost radii both qualitatively resemble the model of @xcite where , characteristic of the isolated evolution of the disk , the dominant @xmath4=2 component has a constant pattern speed @xmath350 @xmath5 out to @xmath31.2 - 1.8 kpc . as for the region between @xmath31.8 kpc and 4.6 kpc in those models where interaction with the companion introduces a succession of transient structures ,",
    "our solutions at both 170@xmath0 and 175@xmath0 otherwise describe at most two steady patterns in distinct radial zones .",
    "+ in the immediate future , observations with higher resolution and sensitivity should afford twr calculations with finer radial bins , thereby allowing for the parameterization of more distinct radial zones , if present .",
    "this will either confirm our solutions for @xmath9 or perhaps demonstrate that solutions describe a succession of many discrete patterns ( similar to the transient structures in the @xcite models ) , or simply a winding , material pattern .",
    "again , though , our multiple - speed and other , quadratic solutions in general more closely follow @xmath83 throughout the disk than @xmath102 characteristic of @xmath4=2 structure in the models of @xcite .",
    "+ despite the lingering ambiguity in the pa , these twr solutions present a new picture of the bright spiral structure of m51 , one that should prompt tests of long - lived density wave theories in other nearby grand - design spirals . at the very least",
    ", this study marks a successful starting point for continued tests of the relation between multiple spiral pattern speeds in a single disk ; investigations into the number and radial domains of pattern speeds and spiral winding in nearby spirals will be the subject of upcoming work .",
