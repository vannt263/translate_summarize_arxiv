    "<S> a @xmath1-valued spectral flow is defined for paths with an adequate symmetry property . the basic idea leading to this definition is already contained in the analysis of @xmath1 invariants of edge states in quantum systems with odd time - reversal symmetry @xcite . in section  [ sec - oddsympsf ] this @xmath1-valued spectral flow of an odd symmetric dilation </S>",
    "<S> is again shown to be equal to the @xmath1 index of the dilated fredholm operator . </S>",
    "<S> a mapping cone interpretation with the flavor of real @xmath0-theory @xcite is sketched in the final section  [ sec - mappingconeodd ] .    </S>",
    "<S> our motivation to revisit the problem of spectral flow and to extend it to @xmath1 indices stems from applications to solid state physics . </S>",
