    "this model has been studied for decades , and has presented substantial challenges to researchers trying to solve it analytically . even in its most basic formulation , where each site is under exactly the same selective pressure ,",
    "the model has not been fully solved to this day .",
    "for the special case of vanishing back mutations , the model reduces to the problem of muller s ratchet @xcite .",
    "a tremendous amount of research effort has been directed at this problem @xcite .",
    "other special cases of this model are mutation ",
    "selection balance when the forward and back mutation rates are equal @xcite , and the speed of adaptation under various conditions @xcite .    in 1996",
    ", @xcite pioneered a new approach to studying the multiplicative multi - site model .",
    "they described the evolving population as a localized traveling wave in fitness space , using partial differential equations developed to describe wave - like phenomena in physical systems .",
    "a traveling wave is a localized profile traveling at near - constant speed and shape ( physicists refer to such phenomena also as _ solitary waves _ ) .",
    "we can envision a population as a traveling wave of the distribution of the mutation number over genomes if the relative mutant frequencies in the population stay approximately constant while the population shifts as a whole .",
    "for example , a population may have specific abundances of sequences at one , two , three , or more mutations away from the least loaded class at all times , but the least - loaded class moves at constant speed by one mutation every ten generations .",
    "encouraging results by @xcite were based on two strong approximations .",
    "firstly , all fitness classes , including the best - fit class , were described deterministically , neglecting random effects due to finite population size .",
    "finite population size was introduced into the problem as a cutoff of the effect of selection at the high - fitness edge , when the size of a class becomes less than one copy of a genome .",
    "secondly , @xcite approximated the traveling wave profile with a function continuous in fitness ( or mutation load ) .",
    "in these approximations , @xcite demonstrated the existence of a continuous set of waves with different speeds .",
    "the cutoff condition determined the choice of a specific solution and the dependence of the speed on the population size .",
    "@xcite confirmed the qualitative conclusions by @xcite and refined their quantitative results in two ways , by taking into account the random effects acting on the smallest , best - fit class , and showing that , in a broad parameter range , approximating the logarithm of the wave profile as a smooth function of the fitness is a much better approximation than approximating the wave profile itself as a smooth function .",
    "it was shown that the substitution rate increases logarithmically with the population size , until the deterministic single - site limit is reached at extremely large population sizes and the theory breaks down .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that the results by @xcite can still be improved regarding both the treatment of the high - fitness edge and the deterministic part of the fitness distribution .",
    "because the original work was presented in an extremely condensed format , we will here re - derive the general theory in detail .",
    "then , we will present improved treatments of the stochastic edge that lead to accurate predictions for the substitution rate defined as the average gain in beneficial alleles per genome per generation .",
    "we consider in detail two opposite parametric limits , muller s ratchet ( when beneficial mutation events are not important ) and adaptive evolution ( when deleterious mutations are not important ) .    because the range of validity of our approach caused some confusion in the literature ,",
    "we discuss it in detail in the main text and appendix .",
    "briefly , both in muller s ratchet and in the adaptation regime , we assume that the total number of sites is large , and the selection coefficient @xmath0 is small . the population size @xmath1 should be sufficiently large , so that the difference in the mutational load between the least - loaded and average genomes is much larger than 1 .",
    "in other words , a large number of sites are polymorphic at any time . for the adaptive evolution",
    ", the condition corresponds to the average substitution rate @xmath2 being much larger than @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the beneficial mutation rate , or population sizes being much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath2 is much larger than @xmath6 . in smaller populations",
    ", adaptation occurs by isolated selective sweeps at different sites , and one - site models apply .",
    "two - site models of adaptation , such as the clonal interference theory @xcite , can be used to describe the narrow transitional interval in @xmath1 .",
    "further , if the deleterious mutation rate per genome is much larger than @xmath0 , and the average population fitness is sufficiently high , an additional broad interval of @xmath1 appears , where deleterious mutations accumulate ( muller s ratchet ) . using numeric simulations and analytic estimates , we demonstrate good accuracy of our results in a very broad parameter range relevant for various asexual organisms , including asexual rna and dna viruses , yeast , some plants , and fish .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model and the general method to derive evolutionary dynamics in terms of the fitness distribution . in section 3 and 4 ,",
    "we consider in detail two particular cases , muller s ratchet and the process of adaptation , respectively , and test analytic results with computer simulations . in section 4",
    ", we discuss our findings .",
    "we consider a multi - site model of @xmath7 sites , where each site can be in two states , i.e. , carry one of two alleles , either advantageous or deleterious .",
    "the deleterious allele reduces the overall fitness of a genome by a factor of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the selective disadvantage per site .",
    "we assume that there are no biological interactions between sites ( epistasis ) , so that the fitness of a genome with @xmath10 deleterious alleles ( mutational load ) is @xmath11 .",
    "we refer to the frequency of sequences with mutational load @xmath10 in the population as @xmath12 , and write the population - average fitness as @xmath13 .",
    "we introduce @xmath14 , which is mutational load for which a sequence s fitness is exactly equal to the population mean fitness , as given by @xmath15 . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath14 is approximately the average mutational load in the population , @xmath16 .",
    "we denote the mutational load of the best - fit sequence in the population as @xmath17 .",
    "note that in general @xmath18 , that is , the best- fit sequence in the population is not the sequence with the overall highest possible fitness .",
    "we assume that an allele can mutate into an opposite allele with a small probability @xmath19 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity of the derivation , we assume that the mutation rate is low , so that there is , at most , one mutation per genome per generation .",
    "the case when multiple mutations per genome are frequent takes place at very large population sizes when the average substitution rate is high , larger than one new beneficial allele per generation .",
    "@xcite considered this more general case and showed that there is no essential change in the final expression for the substitution rate .",
    "thus , for finite population size , the assumption of a single mutation per genome per round of replication is not limiting ( see also the next subsection ) .    in real genomes , @xmath0 varies between sites .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite argued that the distribution of @xmath0 differs between sites with beneficial and deleterious alleles .",
    "a viable genome represents a highly - fit , non - random selection of alleles , so that deleterious mutations should generally have larger effects than beneficial mutations . for the same reason",
    ", these authors predicted that the effective distribution of @xmath0 for beneficial alleles should have a universal exponential form . in the present work",
    ", we do not consider variation in @xmath0 .",
    "instead , we use a simplified model including only those sites into the total number of sites @xmath7 with either deleterious and beneficial alleles whose selection coefficient is on the order of the same typical value @xmath0 , and approximate all selection coefficients at these sites with a constant @xmath0 .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 and , hence , of the set of included sites depends on the time scale of evolution under consideration .",
    "strongly deleterious mutations with effects much larger than @xmath0 are cleared rapidly from a population .",
    "strongly beneficial mutations are fixed at the early stages of evolution .",
    "note that in the `` clonal interference '' approximation @xcite , which considers competition between two beneficial clones emerging at two sites , variation of @xmath0 must be taken into account to make continuous adaptation possible .",
    "in contrast , in the present theory , which allows new beneficial clones to grow inside of already existing clones , the importance of variation in @xmath0 is less obvious .",
    "we hope to address this matter elsewhere .",
    "we discuss the validity of our approach in detail for the limits of muller s ratchet and adaptation and give a summary of the central simplifications  numbered 1 through 6 and referenced throughout the text  in the appendix .",
    "note that we can verify the validity of the various assumptions only after the fact , once we have obtained our final results .",
    "all simplifications are asymptotically exact , i.e. , are based on the existence of small dimensionless parameters .",
    "the most limiting requirements are that the high - fitness tail of the distribution is long , and that the distribution is far from the unloaded and fully loaded ( possible best - fit and less - fit ) genomes .",
    "the first idea underlying the approach of `` solitary wave '' is to classify all genomes in a population according to their fitness ( mutational load ) , regardless of specific locations of deleterious alleles in a genome , and focus on evolution of fitness classes .",
    "the second idea is to describe evolution of most fitness classes deterministically . to take into account the effects of finite population size , such as genetic drift and randomness of mutation events , only one class with the highest fitness",
    "is described stochastically using the standard two - allele diffusion approach .",
    "the best - fit class is considered a minority `` allele '' in a population , and all other sequences are considered the majority `` allele '' .",
    "the reason why stochastic effects can be neglected already for the next - to - best class is that , in a broad parameter range , the fitness distribution decreases exponentially towards the stochastic edge .",
    "hence , the next - to - best class is large enough to neglect stochastic effects , especially in the adaptation regime ( see estimates in sections 3 and 4 ) .",
    "we note that neglecting stochastic effects completely and considering the limit of infinite population is not correct . as we show below , stochastic processes acting on the best - fit class limit the overall evolution rate and make it dependent on the population size . even for a modest number of sites ( @xmath7 = 15 - 20 )",
    ", the substitution rate is predicted to reach the true deterministic limit only in astronomically large populations not found in nature @xcite . for the same reason ,",
    "the assumption of one mutation per genome we made in our model is not a limiting factor and , as shown by @xcite , does not change much in the final expression for the average substitution rate .",
    "the formal procedure consists of several steps , as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the frequencies of all fitness classes excluding the best - fit class are described by a deterministic balance equation .",
    "\\(ii ) the equation is shown to have a traveling wave solution with an arbitrary speed ( the average substitution rate ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the leading front of the wave ( high - fitness tail of the distribution ) is shown to end abruptly at a point , expressed in terms of the wave speed .",
    "\\(iv ) the difference between the values of the fitness distribution at the center and the edge is expressed in terms of the wave speed .",
    "\\(v ) the value at the center is found from the normalization condition .",
    "\\(vi ) because the biological justification for the lack of genomes beyond the high - fitness cutoff is finite size of population , the cutoff point is identified with the stochastic edge .",
    "\\(vii ) to determine the wave speed as a function of the population size , the average frequency of the least - loaded class is estimated from the classical diffusion result and matched to the deterministic cutoff value .",
    "we proceed with the first step . on the basis of our model assumptions and neglecting multiple mutation events per generation per genome , we can write the deterministic time evolution of the frequency @xmath20 of genomes with mutational load @xmath10 as @xmath21 where @xmath10 runs from 0 to @xmath7 and @xmath22 . by definition ,",
    "@xmath23 for all times @xmath24 .",
    "now we introduce the total per - genome mutation rate @xmath25 , and the ratio of beneficial mutation rate per genome to the total mutation rate , @xmath26 . inserting these expressions into eq .  , expressing @xmath27 in terms of @xmath14 , expanding @xmath28 ( which we are allowed to do under the condition that @xmath29 , simplification  1 ) , and neglecting all terms proportional to @xmath30 , we arrive at : @xmath31f_k(t)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as mentioned before , we consider the case when the traveling wave is far from the sequence with the highest possible fitness , @xmath32 , as given by the condition @xmath33 . therefore",
    ", @xmath34 depends only slowly ( linearly ) on @xmath10 , we are allowed to replace @xmath34 by @xmath35 ( simplification  2 ) , and find @xmath36f_k(t)\\,.\\ ] ]    our goal is to turn this expression into a continuous differential equation .",
    "as the mutation rates are low , @xmath20 evolves very slowly in time , and we can write @xmath37 ( simplification  3 ) .",
    "we need to be more careful when making a continuous approximation for @xmath38 as a function of @xmath10 . as we show below , @xmath20 changes rapidly with @xmath10 in the important high fitness tail .",
    "therefore , the taylor expansion of @xmath20 is not justified . however , the logarithm of @xmath20 is a smooth function of @xmath10 in a broad parameter range , provided the `` lead '' of the distribution is large ( simplification  4 ) .",
    "[ the lead is the difference in number of mutations from the population center to the least - loaded class in the population @xcite . ] therefore , a better approximation , which represents an improvement on the work by @xcite , is to do the taylor expansion on @xmath39 and write @xmath40 $ ] . with these approximations , and after introducing a rescaled time @xmath41 and a rescaled selection coefficient @xmath42 , we find @xmath43 this nonlinear partial differential equation describes the deterministic movement of the population in fitness space over time .",
    "( note that , for sufficiently large @xmath1 , the assumptions of simplifications 1 and 3 may be violated , so that technically , we can neither expand fitness in @xmath10 nor replace discrete time with continuous time in this regime .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite showed that the continuous equation for the fitness distribution , eq .",
    ", can be derived in a more general way , without assuming @xmath44 , nor expanding fitness in @xmath10 , nor neglecting multiple mutations per genome per generation [ see the transition from eq .",

    "the dependence is , however , very weak in the limit of a large genome size  @xmath7 . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we shall assume that the observation time is very small compared to the time in which @xmath14 changes by @xmath7 and , thus , @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be considered constant . at the same time , because the distribution is very far from the class without deleterious alleles , @xmath47 , a considerable shift of the distribution can occur during the observation time .",
    "a broad class of partial differential equations affords solutions in the form of traveling waves .",
    "a wave is a fixed shape , described by a function @xmath48 , that moves through space without changing its form . in the case of an evolving population",
    ", space corresponds to the mutational load , @xmath10 . a traveling wave solution to eq .",
    "can be expressed as the movement of the center of the population over time , @xmath49 , and the shape of the wave around this center , which we write as @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "we therefore make the _ ansatz _ ( simplification  5 ) that @xmath51\\,\\ ] ] after inserting eq .   into eq .   and writing @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and we have introduced the wave velocity @xmath55 , that is , the speed of movement of the population center @xmath14 over time , @xmath56 .    for a given wave velocity @xmath55 , eq .   and @xmath57 fully specify the shape of the wave @xmath48 . although it is not possible to solve eq .   in the general form ,",
    "analytically , below we will be able to find the velocity of the wave .",
    "the first step is to derive @xmath57 from the normalization condition .",
    "the validity of the approach by @xcite requires that the _ logarithm _ of the fitness distribution , @xmath48 , can be approximated with a smooth function of @xmath58 . in other words ,",
    "the characteristic scale in @xmath58 given by the length of the high - fitness tail is much larger than unit .",
    "the condition is always met when population is evolving at many sites at a time . because the fitness distribution itself , @xmath59 $ ] , is not replaced with a smooth function of @xmath58 , it does not have to be broad : whether the half - width of the wave is small or large is irrelevant for the validity of the approach . in the treatment of adaptation limit ( section 4 ) , the wave can be either broad or narrow , depending on the range of population sizes .",
    "the two cases , however , have different normalization conditions , as follows .",
    "if the wave is narrow , @xmath60}=\\text{var}[x]\\ll 1 $ ] , most of the distribution is localized at @xmath61 , and from the normalization sum @xmath62 we have @xmath63 ( the exception is the case when @xmath14 is nearly half - integer , and the two adjacent classes have comparable sizes . )    if the wave is broad , @xmath60}\\gg 1 $ ] , the normalization condition is less trivial .",
    "the normalization sum @xmath62 can be replaced with an integral , @xmath64 .",
    "as we will see momentarily , the main contribution to the integral comes from the interval of @xmath58 such that @xmath65 is much larger than 1 but much smaller than the high - fitness tail length , so that @xmath66 .",
    "hence , we can expand the exponential terms in eq .",
    "to the first order ( simplification  6 ) , and find @xmath67 clearly , @xmath66 when @xmath68 , and therefore this latter condition determines the validity of eq .  .",
    "integrating in @xmath58 , taking into account the normalization condition , we obtain the expression for @xmath48 near the wave center @xmath69 in particular , the desired expression for @xmath57 has a form @xmath70    note that @xmath48 was defined as @xmath71 .",

    "in other words , if deleterious mutations accumulate , the rate of their accumulation can not exceed @xmath74 if time is measured in units of @xmath75 . also , as we already stated , the gaussian expression for the central part of the wave is valid if the width of the wave @xmath76}}$ ] is much larger than 1 . for moderate or small wave speeds , @xmath77 or @xmath78",

    ". we emphasize that the validity of this expression is not restricted to the case of broad fitness distribution and can be derived directly from eq .",

    "qualitatively , the theorem states that , the broader the wave , the larger the characteristic difference in fitness between two representative genomes , and the stronger the effect of positive selection on the substitution rate .      in the previous subsections ,",
    "we have derived a continuous wave equation that gives a deterministic description of how the bulk of the population moves over time in fitness space .",
    "however , the speed of the wave remains undefined .",
    "as it turns out , the behavior of a small class of best - fit genomes determines the speed .",
    "below we show that the deterministic wave has a cutoff in the high - fitness tail of the wave whose position is defined by the wave speed and model parameters .",
    "the biological reason behind the deterministic cutoff are stochastic factors acting on finite populations .",
    "highly - fit genomes are either gradually lost ( muller s ratchet ) or gradually gained ( adaptation ) by a population .",
    "thus , the deterministic cutoff is identified with the `` stochastic edge '' of the wave that gradually advances or retreats ( fig .  [",
    "fig : stochastic - edge ] ) .",
    "the rate of the loss or gain of the least - loaded class , which depends on the population size , ultimately determines the speed of the wave . to obtain the desired condition for the wave speed , in the next subsection",

    "we can not solve eq .   explicitly .",
    "fortunately , we can extract the location of the stochastic edge by interpreting eq .   as an equation that describes a function @xmath79 rather than a function @xmath80 .",

    "our eventual goal is to find an expression that relates the speed of the wave , @xmath55 , to the population size @xmath1 , mutation rate @xmath75 , selective coefficient @xmath0 , and the fraction of beneficial mutations @xmath45 .",
    "it turns out that we can achieve this goal by considering the difference @xmath98 . by evaluating this difference in two alternative ways ,",
    "we end up with the desired relation .",
    "first , we note that @xmath99 we can evaluate the integral on the right - hand side by making the subsitution @xmath100 , integrating by parts , and using @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "we have now calculated @xmath98 by integrating over @xmath80 .",
    "alternatively , we can calculate this difference by evaluating @xmath48 directly at 0 and at @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath57 follows from eq .   if the argument of the logarithm is much smaller than 1 ( large half - width of the wave ) , and @xmath108 in the opposite limit ( small half - width ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath109 represents the logarithm of the genome frequency right at the stochastic edge .",
    "since this value is dominated by stochastic effects , we can not evaluate @xmath109 on the basis of the deterministic theory we have developed so far .",
    "therefore , we proceed as follows .",
    "we give the genome frequency at the stochastic edge proper stochastic treatment and base our estimate of the expected genome frequency at the stochastic edge on these probabilistic arguments .",
    "the deterministic derivation in the previous subsections demonstrates the existence of a continuous set of solitary waves with various speeds , i.e. , average substitution rates .",

    "instead , the speed of adaptation depends simply on the growth rate of the mutants at different sites . as a consequence , in the mulitplicative fitness model ,",
    "linkage between sites becomes irrelevant , and we can describe the system behavior with the single site model , @xmath305 where @xmath306 is the frequency of the beneficial allele at the given site , and we have assumed that deleterious mutations do not occur",

    ", the assumption @xmath315 is violated , and the traveling - wave approach ceases to be valid . for population sizes exceeding @xmath314 ,",
    "the system behavior is essentially independent of population size , and linkage does not slow down the speed of adaptation .",
    "we have derived accurate expressions for the speed of muller s ratchet and the speed of adaptation in a finite , asexual population .",
    "our expressions are numerically valid in a wide parameter range .",
    "the main difference between the work presented here and the work of @xcite is an improved and more intuitive treatment of the stochastic egde , and the analytic derivation of correction terms for the discontiuity at @xmath110 for both muller s ratchet and the speed of adaptation .",
    "the latter correction terms lead to significantly improved numerical accuracy in a wide range of population sizes .",
    "a quantitative treatment of muller s ratchet was first attempted by @xcite , who studied primarily the case in which ratchet clicks are rare , so that the population can equilibrate between subsequent ratchet clicks . since then , numerous studies have derived improved estimates of the ratchet rate @xcite . most approaches to calculate the ratchet rate work either in the case @xmath316 , when fixation events of deleterious alleles at different sites are well separated in time and the one - site theory applies , or in the limit of very large population sizes , when the deterministic expectation for the size of the fittest class @xmath317 is much larger than 1 . in the former case ,",
    "the ratchet rate is estimated as the rate at which deleterious mutations enter the population , multiplied with the probability of fixation of deleterious mutations @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the ratchet rate is estimated from the average time the fittest class takes to drift from its equilibrium value to an occupancy of zero @xcite . a third approach , most closely related to the present work , is a quantitative genetics approach whereby the fitness distribution is described by its mean , variance , and higher moments , and equations",
    "are derived that describe the change of these moments over time @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of this approach is that it generally requires an arbitrary cutoff condition to truncate the moment expansion , and that the equations become quickly untractable if higher moments are included .",
    "the rapid ratchet region described in the present work corresponds , mostly , to @xmath318 smaller than 1 ( fig .",
    "5c ) . for small @xmath318 ,",
    "the work by @xcite is generally regarded as giving accurate estimates for the ratchet rate .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that @xcite did not actually derive a closed form expression for the ratchet rate .",
    "a key parameter in his result needs to be determined numerically by iteration .",
    "moreover , several of his expressions were not derived from first principles , but chosen on the basis that they provided a good fit to simulation results .",
    "in contrast , our expression eq .   was derived from first principles and is a simple , closed - form expression that can be plotted easily , if we interpret it as describing @xmath1 as a function of @xmath55 ( rather than @xmath55 as a function of @xmath1 ) .",
    "the traveling wave approach also provides a convenient framework to study the ratchet speed in the presence of beneficial mutations , or , conversely , the speed of adaptation in the presence of deleterious mutations .",
    "all that is required is to keep the full expression @xmath98 , eq .",
    ", instead of its respective asymptotics .",
    "while we did not discuss these cases here in detail , the corresponding calculations are straightforward and lead to closed - form expressions [ see @xcite , supplementary text ] . in comparison , other approaches may lead to similarly accurate expressions , but usually do not yield closed - form expressions . for example , @xcite studied the effect of beneficial mutations in the presence of muller s ratchet .",
    "they used a poisson approximation for the steady - state distributions of mutations in populations undergoing muller s ratchet , explicitly modeled the behavior of beneficial mutations arising in all possible mutation classes , and used the resulting fixation rates as corrections for the ratchet rate derived by @xcite for @xmath319 and by @xcite for @xmath320 .",
    "this approach leads to accurate results in a wide parameter range , but the final equations contain sums over all mutation classes , and these sums can not be evaluated analytically .    finally , with the traveling wave approach",
    ", it is also possible to consider the general case when both beneficial and deleterious mutations are equally important , including steady state at finite @xmath1 , @xmath321 in eq .  , which differs from equilibrium at infinite @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , to achieve a high accuracy in this case requires some additional work on the stochastic edge condition .      in an asexual population",
    ", the speed of adaptation does not grow linearly with @xmath1 for large @xmath1 , because beneficial mutations that arise contemporaneously in independent genetic backgrounds can not recombine , and , therefore , only a small fraction of all beneficial mutations that survive drift can actually go to fixation @xcite .",
    "one reason why a beneficial mutation may not go to fixation is interference with another mutation with a larger beneficial effect that arises either shortly before or shortly after the first mutation @xcite .",
    "recently , a theory that predicts the evolutionary rate in large asexual populations in the presence of this interference process has received considerable attention ( clonal interference - theory , @xcite ) .",
    "however , interference does not necessarily occur in the presence of a single alternative mutation .",
    "in fact , multiple beneficial mutations arising in the already existing clones  that have moderate individual effect but large combined effect  can rescue clones with a smaller beneficial effect and partly resolve the clonal interference .",
    "the clonal interference theory neglects this effect and predicts that the substitution rate rapidly approaches a constant with increasing @xmath1 ( under the assumption of exponentially distributed beneficial effects , @xcite ) , and that further increases in the speed of adpatation can only come from fixation of mutations with increasingly larger beneficial effects .",
    "this prediction is , most likely , not entirely correct , because an increase in population size also increases the chance that multiple mutations occur in the same clone . in general",
    ", we expect the clonal interference theory to have a very limited range of applicability . if beneficial mutations are rare , interference is irrelevant to the speed of adaptation , and @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath322 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the population size is large and beneficial mutations are frequent , then multiple mutations within a single clone should be frequent as well , and we expect the current clonal interference theory to underestimate the speed of adaptation in this regime .",
    "in contrast to the clonal interference approach , the traveling wave approach considers multiple mutations .",
    "however , the present model does not consider interference from mutations with a larger beneficial effect , because all mutations are assumed to have the same selection coefficient .",
    "( note that , as a consequence , the substitution rate and the speed of adaptation are essentially equivalent in our model , as they differ only by a constant factor @xmath0 , whereas they are distinct quantities if there is variation in the selection coefficient , as is the case in the clonal interference models . ) because of these differences in model assumptions , we can not make a quantitative comparison between the two theories .",
    "however , we can observe an important qualitative difference : in the traveling - wave theory , the substitution rate keeps slowly increasing with population size until extremely large population sizes .",
    "for very large population sizes , such that @xmath323 , the substitution rate becomes on the order of @xmath324 . at this point ,",
    "the tail of the wave reaches the best possible genome , @xmath32 , and the traveling wave theory breaks down @xcite . at higher population sizes ,",
    "the one - locus model applies , and the value of the substitution rate saturates at the infinite - size value .",
    "thus , we predict a continuous transition from the finite - population case in which linkage slows down the speed of adaptation to the infinite - population case in which linkage has no effect on the speed of adaptation in the multiplicative model @xcite . by contrast",
    ", @xcite argued that a finite asexual population is always affected by linkage , regardless of its size .",
    "we must mention , however , that , for reasonable parameter settings , the population size at which the crossing over to the fully deterministic behavior occurs is unbiologically large .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath325 and @xmath326 , we find that @xmath1 has to be on the order of @xmath327 , and this number grows rapidly for larger @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to stress that the speed of adaptation is , in general , not governed by the total supply of beneficial mutations , @xmath322 , because @xmath1 and @xmath4 enter the expressions for the speed of adaptation independently and in different functional forms .",
    "this fact had already been noted by @xcite , and its implications for experimental tests of the speed of adapation have been discussed recently in the context of clonal interference theory @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed an alternative method to derive , for the same initial model , the speed of adaptation in a large asexual population in the absence of deleterious mutations .",
    "we discuss this method in detail and extend its validity range elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , these authors replace the full population model with a simplified model including only two fitness classes , the least - loaded class and the next - loaded class .",
    "the next - loaded class is assumed to grow exactly exponentially , as if under selection alone .",
    "the click time @xmath249 is determined by extrapolating the growth of the least - loaded class back from infinite time . as in our work , only the least - loaded class is treated stochastically .",
    "the main validity conditions for this approach are , as follows .",
    "the next - loaded class can be treated deterministically if @xmath328 , which is equivalent to @xmath329 , the same condition that we use in our work .",
    "( note that inequality @xmath330 given by @xcite was obtained for @xmath331 ; for general @xmath254 , the condition is as we state . )",
    "the back - extrapolation procedure is valid at moderate population sizes or adaptation rates , such that @xmath332 @xcite .",

    "the accuracy of the replacement of the full population model with the two - class model and of the actual dynamics of the next - loaded class with an exponential is less clear .",
    "new beneficial mutations into the class create a time - dependent prefactor at the exponential .",
    "yet , it is quite possible , that at moderate @xmath254 or @xmath2 where the cited approach is designed to apply , the approximation works well .",
    "we tested the numeric accuracy of the substitution rate predicted by @xcite with the use of monte - carlo simulation of the full population model in different parameter regions . within its validity range",
    ", their result agrees with simulation within 10 - 20% and is very similar to our result ( fig .",

    "proposing some estimates of parameter values of @xmath6 and @xmath0 typical for yeast , they argue that this regime corresponds to huge population sizes and conclude that results by @xcite are relevant for viruses only .",
    "in fact , the traveling wave approach requires that the logarithm of the fitness distribution , not the fitness distribution itself , is smooth in the mutational load , which takes place when the high - fitness tail of the distribution @xmath254 ( not the half - width ) is larger than 1 .",
    "the condition is met at much smaller substitution rates , @xmath336 , which is the low bound assumed by @xcite .",
    "the likely reason for the confusion is that @xcite normalized the fitness distribution assuming it is broad , which corresponds to the case @xmath335 . when the wave is narrow , which happens in the interval @xmath337 , the normalization condition is simply replaced with @xmath108 ( subsection 2.4 ) .",
    "except for the trivial change in normalization , whether the wave is broad or narrow does not matter . in the final expression for the substitution rate , the difference between the two cases @xmath337 and @xmath335 is in a constant factor at @xmath1 , eqs . and",
    "numerically , the two expression are quite similar in the parameter range we test .",
    "therefore , the results of the traveling wave approach apply in both intervals of the substitution rate and are potentially relevant for a broad variety of asexual organisms , including rna and dna viruses , yeast , coral , and some species of plants and fish .    to summarize , we have applied the semi - deterministic traveling wave approach to derive the rate of muller s ratchet and the speed of adaptation in a multi - site model of an asexually reproducing population .",
    "our results underscore the importance of a proper stochastic treament of the best - fit class .",
    "our method , based on a continuous approximation to logarithm of the fitness distribution of the other ( deterministic ) classes , ensures fair accuracy in a very broad parameter range .",
