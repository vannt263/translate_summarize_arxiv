    "supersoft x - ray binaries ( ssb ) were established as a new class of astronomical objects during the early years of this decade ( trmper  1991 , greiner  1991 , kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 ) and are thought to contain white dwarfs accreting mass at rates high enough to allow quasi - steady nuclear burning of the accreted matter ( van den heuvel  1992 ) .",
    "the sources are highly luminous ( @xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 ) , but since their characteristic temperatures are on the order of tens of ev , much of the energy is radiated in the far ultraviolet or soft x - ray region of the spectrum , where the radiation is easily absorbed by the interstellar medium . because of this , only 2 close - binary galactic supersoft sources are known although there should be about 1000 in the milky way ( distefano & rappaport 1994 ) . the quest to find new ssbs has inspired several projects .    here",
    "we report on the discovery of a new ssb . we have taken and analyzed rosat data that verify that the binary v751 cyg is indeed a luminous supersoft x - ray source . because of the importance of being able to identify additional ssbs",
    ", we also report on the reasoning that led us to suspect that v751 cyg was likely to be a transient ssb .",
    "vy scl stars are a subclass of nova - like , cataclysmic variables which are bright most of the time , but occasionally drop in brightness by several magnitudes at irregular intervals ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the transitions between the brightness levels occur on timescales of days to weeks .",
    "these variables have large mass transfer rates  ( of the order of 10@xmath6 /yr ) , and thus are thought to be steady accretors with hot disks .",
    "livio & pringle ( 1994 ) proposed a model for the group of vy scl stars in which the brightness drop is due to a reduced mass transfer rate which in turn may be caused by a magnetic spot temporarily covering the @xmath7 region .",
    "7   (= em * lkha 170 = svs 1202 ) was discovered by martynov ( 1958 ) , showing irregular variations and occasional fadings down to about 16@xmath8 ( martynov & kholopov 1958 ) .",
    "now - a - days 7  is classified as a nova - like variable based on the observed rapid flickering and the complete similarity to vy scl ( robinson  1974 ) .",
    "the orbital period of 7  is not well known , but estimated to @xmath9 6 hrs ( bell & walker 1980 ) .",
    "full details of the observations of 7  will appear elsewhere ( greiner  1998 ) , so we only summarize the relevant information here .",
    "the distinct lightcurve of 0513  and its similarity to vy scl stars led us to decide to monitor the light curves of the 14 known vy scl stars .",
    "when 7  started to drop in brightness somewhere between 1 march and 11 march 1997 ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] ) we performed a target - of - opportunity rosat hri observation ( 4660 sec ) on 3 june 1997 .",
    "we discovered a new x - ray source , rx j2052.2 + 4419 , within 1  of v751 cyg , at a mean count rate of 0.015 cts / s . during a second rosat hri observation on dec .",
    "28 , 1997 the count rate and x - ray spectrum are nearly identical to the june values .",
    "in contrast , 7  was not detected during the rosat all - sky survey on nov . 19/20 , 1990 giving a 3@xmath10 upper limit of 0.019 cts / s in the pspc .",
    "in addition , it was also not detected during a serendipituous pointing on nov .",
    "11 , 1992 providing an upper limit of 0.0058 cts / s in the pspc . on both occasions",
    "7  was in its optical bright state .",
    "we therefore find evidence for an anti - correlation of optical and x - ray intensity in 7 .",
    "using a new method ( prestwich  1998 ) to extract reliable spectral information from hri data , we crafted a response matrix which takes into account both the gain state of the detector at the time of the observation and the `` wobble '' of the hri during the detection .",
    "fits using this response matrix to all the source photons of v751 cyg show that simple black - body models with kt of a few tens of ev are consistent with the data , whereas higher temperature models ( 0.5 kev ) can be ruled out ( fig .",
    "[ ufs ] ) .",
    "an iue observation performed in 1985 ( also during an optical high state ) was used to derive the extinction towards 7  based on the broad absorption centered at 2200  .",
    "the best result is obtained with a value of @xmath11 . with the intrinsic color being near zero , this implies a visual extinction of @xmath12 . using a mean extinction law of @xmath13 = 1.9 mag / kpc ( allen 1973 ) we derive a distance to 7  of 430@xmath14100 pc ,",
    "while using that from neckel & klare ( 1980 ) gives @xmath15=610@xmath1430 pc .",
    "using the absorbing column derived from iue , @xmath16 = 1.1@xmath110@xmath17 @xmath18 , the best - fit blackbody model gives @xmath19 ev and extremely high luminosity , so we adopt @xmath20 ev in the following ( see fig . [ ufs ] ) .",
    "at this temperature , the bolometric luminosity on 3 june 1997 is 6.5@xmath110@xmath2 ( d/500",
    "pc)@xmath3 erg / s .",
    "thus , during its optical low state , 7  was emitting soft x - rays with a temperature and luminosity which confirm that it is a transient supersoft x - ray source .",
    "the following picture emerges . during optical low states 7  exhibits transient soft x - ray emission thus revealing itself as a supersoft x - ray binary .",
    "the appearance of 4686   emission in optical spectra taken in sep .",
    "1997 also indicates the presence of @xmath2154 ev photons .",
    "cyg , like the other members of the vy scl star group , accretes at a few times 10@xmath22 yr@xmath5 .",
    "if the mass of the white dwarf in 7  is small , this may allow nuclear burning , as the high x - ray luminosity suggests .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that recent calculations of hydrogen - accreting carbon - oxygen white dwarfs have shown that the accretion rate for low mass white dwarfs ( 0.50.6 ) can be as low as 13@xmath110@xmath6 /yr ( sion & starrfield 1994 , cassisi  1998 ) while still maintaining shell burning ( consistent with fujimoto 1982 ) .",
    "the 7  values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are consistent , within the uncertainties of @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the relation @xmath27 found for 5 ssb ( van teeseling  1997 ) implying that , if nuclear burning is the correct interpretation of the x - ray flux during the optical low state , then nuclear burning may continue during the optical high state .",
    "there is ample evidence in some vy scl stars that during the optical low state the accretion disk has vanished .",
    "though we have no optical observations to provide direct evidence for this in 7 , the disk is certainly optically thin , thus drastically reducing the efficacy of reprocessing .",
    "this would cause some difference between the optical spectra of 7  and the ssbs in which the optical light is dominated by reprocessed light from the accretion disk ( popham & distefano 1996 ) .",
    "our discovery that 7  is a transient supersoft x - ray source arose from the similarity in the optical light curve of rx j0513.96951 and vy scl stars .",
    "0513 ( schaeidt  1993 , pakull  1993 ) shows @xmath284 week optical low states which are accompanied by luminous supersoft x - ray emission ( reinsch  1996 , southwell  1996 ) .",
    "it is generally assumed that the white dwarf accretes at a rate slightly higher than the burning rate , and thus is in an inflated state during the optical high state .",
    "changes in the irradiation of the disk caused by the expanding / contracting envelope around the white dwarf have been proposed as explanation for the 1 mag intensity variation in 0513  ( reinsch  1996 , southwell  1996 ) .",
    "note , that the white dwarf itself varies drastically as it expands / contracts , and in fact a flaring disk had to be assumed for 0513  to reduce the theoretically possible amplitude down to only 1 mag ( hachisu & kato 1998 ) .",
    "the explanation of the x - ray / optical variability of 7  could be similar to rx j0513.96951 ( pakull  1993 , reinsch  1996 , southwell  1996 ) : variations change both the photospheric radius and the disk spectrum .",
    "if the white dwarf has a small mass , than photospheric radius expansion is reached at 1@xmath110@xmath29 /yr ( cassisi  1998 ) .",
    "a major difference between the optical light curves of 0513  and vy scl stars is the amplitude between low and high states , i.e. 1 mag ( 0513 ) versus 36 mag for vy scl stars ( 4 mag for 7 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath3015 ev blackbody model derived as the best fit for 7corresponds to a m@xmath3120 mag , i.e. several magnitudes fainter than the observed optical low - state intensity ( fig .",
    "indeed , an amplitude of 4 mag can be easily accommodated by a white dwarf when expanding from r@xmath32 to 5 r@xmath32 .",
    "thus , the observed large amplitudes in vy scl stars could be due to a combination of both the disk disappearance and the white dwarf contraction .",
    "the discovery of luminous , supersoft x - ray emission during the optical low state of 7  naturally leads to the question of whether other vy scl stars may also be ssbs .",
    "it turns out that the basic properties of vy scl stars correspond surprisingly well to an extension of the ssb class ( see tab .",
    "[ com ] ) : ( i ) in all thouroughly observed vy scl stars , optical emission line studies indicate that the _ donor _ has a mass smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , the _ mass ratio _ ( between the donor and the white - dwarf accretor ) seems to be close to unity in some systems .",
    "( ii ) the _ white dwarf mass _ in vy scl systems may be systematically smaller than generally considered in models for ssbs .",
    "we therefore may be seeing an extension of the co - nuclear - burning white dwarf scenario which has formed the basic model for most ssbs so far .",
    "the low white dwarf mass may lead to a larger effective radii ( vennes  1995 ) and thus lower temperatures .",
    "( iii ) the orbital periods of vy scl stars range from @xmath34 hours to @xmath35 hours , with the longest period associated with v751 cyg .",
    "these periods are compatible with the orbital periods of some other ssbs , most notably 1e 0035.47230 with its 4.1 hr orbital period ( schmidtke  1996 ) .",
    "however , such 34 hr orbital periods are significantly lower than those required in the canonical van den heuvel  ( 1992 ) model for supersoft sources in which a possibly slightly evolved donor more massive than the white dwarf provides a mass transfer on a thermal timescale .",
    "however , it has recently been shown that the strong x - ray flux in supersoft sources should excite a strong wind ( @xmath36 /yr ) from the irradiated companion which in short - period binaries would be able to drive roche lobe overflow at a rate comparable to @xmath37 ( van teeseling & king 1998 ) .",
    "( iv ) the value of @xmath38 typically adopted in vy scl systems ( warner 1987 ) is @xmath39 yr@xmath5 . interestingly enough , these values may be compatible with quasi - steady burning on white dwarfs with the low masses that seem to be indicated in some vy scl systems .    thus , the conjecture that all vy scl stars are ssbs is viable .",
    "should it be verified , even for a subset of systems , then vy scl stars may represent an extension of the class of ssbs as discussed above and summarized in tab .",
    "[ com ] . even if the underlying mechanisms in ssb and 7   are completely different , the somewhat similar anticorrelations between x - ray and optical have proved useful to identify 7  as a transient supersoft x - ray source .",
    "it has recently been suggested ( steiner & diaz 1998 ; patterson  1998 ) v sge ( and possibly also wx cen , v617 sge and ) have properties very similar to ssbs .",
    "these suggestions are based on the following characteristics , shared by these four stars but rare or even absent among canonical cataclysmic variables : ( 1 ) the presence of both and emission lines , ( 2 ) a @xmath40/h@xmath41 emission line ratio @xmath42 , ( 3 ) rather high absolute magnitudes and very blue colours , and ( 4 ) orbital lightcurves which are characterized by a wide and deep eclipse .",
    "a detailed comparison of the optical states of v sge and archival rosat observations has shown that during optical bright states , v  sge is a faint hard x - ray source , while during optical faint states ( @xmath43 mag ) , v  sge is a ` supersoft ' x - ray source ( greiner & teeseling 1998 ) .",
    "spectral fitting confirms that v  sge s x - ray properties during its soft x - ray state may be similar to those of supersoft x - ray binaries , although a much lower luminosity can not be excluded .",
    "it is possible to explain the different optical / x - ray states of v  sge by a variable amount of extended uneclipsed matter , which during the optical bright states contributes significantly to the optical flux and completely absorbes the soft x - ray component ( greiner & teeseling 1998 ) .",
    "we note that our strategy of finding new , transient ssb by measuring the x - ray emission during optical low states would have worked also for v sge .",
