    "<S> now we examine how a nonunifrom precession phase can affect the result characterized by st - fmr . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of st - fmr relies on two assumptions : one is the uniformity of the precession mode and the other is the uniformity of the rf current . </S>",
    "<S> although the measured driving current is uniform , the assumption of uniform precession breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the signal measured by st - fmr under the macrospin spin approximation . by mixing the rf current with an oscillating magnetoresistence </S>",
    "<S> , we get a rectified voltage : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the precession amplitude and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the real and imaginary susceptibility functions respectively . by fitting the spectrum @xmath47 to a linear combination of the symmetric and anti - symmetric lorentzian functions , one obtains @xmath48 and thus the spin hall efficiency for the normal metal / ferromagnet combination .    to include the effect of spatial variation in @xmath6 , we rewrite the averaged @xmath49 as the integral of the mixing voltage weighted by the precession amplitude ( @xmath44 ) ( see supplementary information@xcite for derivation ) : @xmath50\\nonumber \\\\    & + \\chi '' \\int { \\rm d}r~\\theta_{\\rm p}(r )   \\sin \\big [ \\varphi_{\\rm rf } - \\varphi_{\\textsc{\\tiny fmr}}(r ) \\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we find the equivalent phase difference between the fmr and rf current that would be obtained from the global measurement is : @xmath51}{\\int { \\rm d}r~\\theta_{\\rm p}(r )   \\cos\\big [ \\varphi_{\\textsc{\\tiny fmr}}(r)- \\varphi_{\\rm rf } \\big]}\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : st - fmr_correction ] ]    as an interesting point , the phase correction @xmath52 is only determined by the spatial varying component of the fmr phase @xmath53 and the precession amplitude @xmath54 , and is independent of the overall offset @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we can substitute @xmath56 for @xmath6 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : st - fmr_phase ] . using trigonometry , </S>",
    "<S> we can rewrite eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : st - fmr_phase ] : @xmath57}{\\int { \\rm d}r~\\theta_{\\rm </S>",

    "<S> \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the correction for the phase ( also driving field angle ) @xmath52 is independent of the driving field angle near the channel center @xmath58 .    to numerically evaluate the correction resulting from the phase nonuniformity , we use the polynomial fits of the precession amplitude @xmath59 and driving field angle @xmath60 to mimic the experimental results , plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : st - fmr_correction ] . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we assume both the phase and amplitude of the precession are uniform in the @xmath40 direction and we only consider the spatial variation along the @xmath0 direction . </S>",
    "<S> we get an `` averaged '' value of the effective driving field , @xmath61 , shown as the red line in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : st - fmr_correction ] ( b ) . in this example , the phase correction @xmath62 .    as </S>",
    "<S> shown in table  [ tab : comparison ] , for the spin hall sample there is a substantial discrepancy between @xmath63 at the channel center and the st - fmr results . at the same time , @xmath64 obtained by including the the spatially varying phase is consistent with @xmath65 measured from st - fmr , within experimental errors . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we argue that the st - fmr technique does not necessarily reflect the phase value in the middle of the sample , nor does it sense a uniform phase , rather it provides a spatially averaged phase . although the electrical techniques have a superior sensitivity , we show an example where it is essential to include a correction for spatial variations of both precession phase and amplitude to correctly quantify the spin hall efficiency from electrical measurements .     </S>",

    "<S> , we found that the driving field points around @xmath78 out of the sample plane at the center . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we observe a substantial precession phase variation across the width of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the phase variation to be important in the micro- and nano - structures , depending on device details . </S>",
    "<S> we have also evaluated the correction term in driving field angle @xmath52 due to the phase variation . in the case of nonuniform precession phase , </S>",
    "<S> we have established a mechanism by which st - fmr can yield an inaccurate spin hall efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> for the 5  @xmath79 m wide samples studied , when including the spatial variations of the precession amplitude and phase , the integrated spin hall efficiency nearly doubles compared to that in the middle of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , although electrical measurements are very effective techniques to quantify the spin hall effect , we conclude the spatial variations of both precession amplitude and phase can play an important role and should not be overlooked . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have shown that phase - sensitive imagining techniques such as trane microscopy are valuable for quantitative studies of the spin hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial uniformity is also an essential ingredient for understanding damping and switching dynamics in magnetic confined structures . </S>"
