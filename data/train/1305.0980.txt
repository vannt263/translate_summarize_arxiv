    "there is considerable debate over the question of defining a precise boundary between the class of objects known as ` planets ' and those known as ` brown dwarfs ' .",
    "it has been suggested that the two types of objects could be distinguished by their formation mechanism ; however , it is generally difficult to deduce this property from observations of specific objects .",
    "nevertheless , there is a well - defined minimum in the mass distribution ( actually @xmath3 ) , for substellar companions to g and k main - sequence stars , in the range 2030 m@xmath1 @xcite , suggesting that objects near the deuterium - burning limit can ` form like planets ' .",
    "these authors suggest that this minimum does correspond to a ( somewhat imprecise ) dividing line between formation mechanisms and that the upper limit to planet masses should be set at about @xmath4  m@xmath1 .",
    "however , no break is seen near this mass in the distribution of free - floating objects observed in the sigma orionis young cluster @xcite down to 4  m@xmath1 .",
    "together , the observations imply that formation mechanisms do not define a unique mass boundary between planets and brown dwarfs .",
    "another commonly used criterion to classify planets , brown dwarfs and stars is based on nuclear fusion that does or does not occur within the object .",
    "brown dwarfs are defined to be those objects that at some point in their evolution become hot enough in their interiors to burn a majority of the deuterium that was initially present in the object ; however , they never become hot enough to burn @xmath5h by the proton - plus - proton reaction in a self - sustaining manner as true stars do . on the other hand ,",
    "the term planet is applied only to objects that will not burn much deuterium .",
    "this criterion was used by @xcite to separate the two types of objects , and the dividing line was stated to be @xmath6  m@xmath1 , where m@xmath7 g. this dividing line depends on the helium mass fraction , the deuterium abundance , and the metallicity , and @xcite found that for a reasonable range of parameters , 50% of the initial d is burned in the mass range 1214  m@xmath1 .",
    "the evolutionary models used to establish the criterion have a uniform chemical composition , a defined total mass in the vicinity of the 13  m@xmath1 limit , constant in time , an initial radius of about 23 r@xmath1 where r@xmath8  cm , and an initial photospheric temperature ( @xmath9 ) of about 2500  k. the corresponding initial luminosities are @xmath10  l@xmath11 . a starting model of this type has become known as a ` hot - start ' model , characterized by a relatively high initial entropy @xcite .    the question of whether , either for brown dwarfs or planets , the formation mechanism actually leads to such hot - start initial conditions",
    "is still under investigation . for objects formed either by collapse of interstellar clouds or by fragmentation in a protostellar disk by gravitational instability , it is plausible that the hot - start initial condition could be reached @xcite . in the case of gravitational instability ,",
    "@xcite have found , from three - dimensional numerical simulations , that the entropy of newly - formed clumps , near the point where molecular dissociation sets in at the center , is high , possibly consistent with a hot start .",
    "however the dominant process for giant planet formation is most likely the core - nucleated accretion mechanism , in which solid particles first accumulate to form a heavy - element core , then later when the core has attained roughly 510  m@xmath0 , gas is captured from the disk .",
    "a particular set of evolutionary calculations based on this theory @xcite shows that once the planet has become fully formed , its entropy is relatively low , with luminosities on the order of @xmath12 l@xmath11 .",
    "the low entropy is a direct consequence of the assumption made in these calculations that , during the phase of rapid gas accretion , all of the accretion energy is radiated away at the accretion shock at the planet s surface .",
    "thus , the core accretion process can lead to a ` cold start ' .",
    "however the shock treatment is approximate , and the accretion flow can not actually be modelled correctly with 1-d spherically symmetric calculations .",
    "thus other possibilities can arise .",
    "@xcite show that core accretion formation calculations in which none of the energy is radiated at the shock lead to hot - start conditions very similar to those assumed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , intermediate ` warm ' states are also possible outcomes @xcite . in the core - accretion picture , also , the chemical composition is not uniform because of the presence of the core , which turns out for the case of a jupiter mass planet to fall in the range 420  m@xmath0 @xcite .    a massive object of 25  m@xmath1 formed by core accretion @xcite has been shown to burn all of its initial deuterium despite the presence of a heavy - element core of 100 or a few hundred m@xmath0 .",
    "cold - start models , including the core and calculations of the formation phase , have been investigated to determine the d - burning mass limit @xcite .",
    "the results show that the limit still falls within the range 1214 m@xmath1 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present further formation calculations for bodies formed by core - nucleated accretion that end up with a total mass in the 1015  m@xmath1 range in the low - entropy state , and to investigate the effect of various possible initial conditions , as well as physical parameters during the formation stage , on the corresponding deuterium - burning limit .",
    "the evolutionary calculations for giant planets are started at the point where the heavy - element core has a mass of about 1  m@xmath0 , and are carried through the entire formation process as well as the subsequent contraction / cooling phase at constant mass , up to a final age of several gyr .",
    "the assumptions and computational procedures were described in detail in previous publications @xcite .",
    "the early phase of the formation process is dominated by the accretion of planetesimals onto the core ; during this phase the gaseous envelope has low mass , @xmath13  m@xmath0 , and a low accretion rate compared to that of the core .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the effective geometrical capture cross section , @xmath16 is the surface density of solid particles ( planetesimals ) in the protoplanetary disk , @xmath17 is the planet s orbital frequency , and @xmath18 is the gravitational enhancement factor , which is obtained from the calculations of @xcite . the planetesimal radius is taken to be 50 km for the cases with a central star of 2  m@xmath11 and 100 km for the cases with a star of 1  m@xmath11 ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "the smaller size , or a reasonable distribution of planetesimal sizes , tends to reduce the formation time but has little effect on the basic results of this paper .    if no gaseous envelope is present , then @xmath19 , the radius of the heavy - element core .",
    "however , even if the envelope mass is relatively small compared with the core mass , the planetesimals interact with the envelope gas , are slowed down by gas drag , and are subject to ablation and fragmentation .",
    "the trajectories of planetesimals through the envelope are calculated @xcite , and the effective @xmath20 is determined . the material that is deposited in the envelope is then allowed to sink to the core , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "calculations by @xcite show that this assumption is valid at least for the organic and rock components of the planetesimals .",
    "the ices , however , can dissolve in the envelope , so that our ` core mass ' is somewhat overestimated ; the quoted value actually refers to the total excess of heavy - element material , above the solar abundance , in the entire planet .",
    "erosion of the core and possible mixing of some core material into the envelope is not considered .",
    "this process has been shown to be unlikely for the case of jupiter @xcite , but such estimates have not been extended to the case of planets in the 10  m@xmath1 range .",
    "the structure of the hydrogen - helium envelope is calculated according to the differential equations of stellar structure @xcite , which assume hydrostatic equilibrium , a spherically symmetric mass distribution , radiative or convective energy transport , and energy conservation .",
    "the energy sources are provided by planetesimal accretion , contraction of the gaseous envelope , and cooling .",
    "the additional energy source provided by deuterium burning is included in the later phases of accretion and during the constant - mass final cooling phase , once the mass has exceeded 10  m@xmath1 and internal temperatures exceed @xmath21  k. the full set of equations , supplemented by calculation of the mass accretion rates onto the core and the envelope , and of the planetesimal trajectories , is solved by the henyey method @xcite .    at the inner boundary of the envelope the radius",
    "is set to @xmath22 , which is determined from its mean density . during the earlier phases of the evolution ,",
    "when the envelope mass is less than about 0.1  m@xmath1 , the core is assumed to be a mixture of rock and ice with a mean density of @xmath23 . during the later phases , when the pressure at the base of the envelope increases to values above @xmath24 , an aneos equation of state with 50% rock and 50% ice @xcite for the core is used to determine its mean density , which can increase to @xmath25 or higher . in the hydrogen - helium envelope ,",
    "the equation of state is taken to be given by the tables of @xcite , which take into account the partial degeneracy of the electrons as well as non - ideal effects .",
    "the chemical composition is taken to be near - solar , with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are , respectively , the mass fractions of hydrogen , helium , and heavy elements .",
    "the tables of course do not include a @xmath29 component , so the @xmath30 component was adjusted upwards to partially compensate .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity during the formation phase combines the low - temperature atomic / molecular calculation of @xcite with the interstellar grain opacities of @xcite .",
    "the opacity values of the grain component are reduced by a factor 50 to approximately represent the reduction caused by grain growth and settling in the protoplanet @xcite . however , in two of the runs the grain growth and settling are calculated in detail in the temperature range 1001800  k as described in @xcite .",
    "the grain size distributions and the opacities are recalculated in every layer at every time step in that temperature range .",
    "these opacities are important in regulating the rate at which the envelope can contract , and therefore the rate at which it accretes gas .",
    "however , once the envelope is well into the rapid gas accretion phase , at about 0.25  m@xmath1 , the gas accretion rate is limited by the physical properties of the protoplanetary disk near the planet , and the precise values of envelope opacity assume a less - important role .",
    "once the planet reaches its final mass , say 12  m@xmath1 , the grains are assumed to settle rapidly and to evaporate in the interior .",
    "for the final contraction / cooling phase at constant mass , the molecular opacities of @xcite are used , with solar composition , up to a temperature of 3500  k. at and above that temperature , with any reasonable opacity , the interior is convective .    at the outer surface of the envelope",
    ", the mass addition rate of gas , during the earlier phases of accretion , is determined by the requirement that the planet radius @xmath31 match the effective accretion radius , which is given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the sound speed in the disk , @xmath34 is the hill sphere radius , and @xmath35 is the total mass of the planet .",
    "the constant @xmath36 is determined by three - dimensional numerical simulations which calculate the accretion rate of gas from the protoplanetary disk onto the planet @xcite . as a result , in the limit where @xmath34 is small compared with the bondi accretion radius @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "additional boundary conditions at the surface depend on the evolutionary phase . during the early phases when @xmath39 , the density and temperature are set to constant values appropriate for the protoplanetary disk , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the density @xmath40 is determined from the assumed value of @xmath16 using a standard gas - to - solid ratio of 70 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ( gaussian ) disk scale height and @xmath44 is the distance of the planet from the star .",
    "however at some point during the rapid gas accretion phase , the mass addition rate required by condition ( [ eq : reff ] ) exceeds the rate at which matter can be supplied by the disk .",
    "the disk - limited rates , based on three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations , are described in the next section . during that phase ,",
    "the boundary conditions at the actual surface of the planet , whose radius falls well below @xmath45 , are determined through the properties of the accretion shock at this surface , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption is that practically all of the gravitational energy released by the infalling gas is radiated away at the shock ; this energy escapes through the infalling envelope ahead of the shock .",
    "this assumption defines the ` cold start ' for planetary evolution .    during the final phase of cooling at constant mass",
    ", the planet becomes isolated from the disk and the surface boundary conditions change again , to those of a blackbody in hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath48 is the surface temperature , @xmath49 is the total luminosity , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are , respectively , the photospheric values of rosseland mean opacity , pressure , and acceleration of gravity .",
    "insolation from the star is not included .",
    "significant deuterium burning in the mass range considered begins near the end of the phase of rapid gas accretion .",
    "the burning occurs via the reaction @xmath53 with an energy release @xmath54 mev per reaction .",
    "the initial deuterium abundance by mass fraction is set to @xmath55 , consistent with the value derived from the local interstellar medium @xcite .",

    "this rate is then multiplied by the screening factor , which takes into account ion - ion and ion - electron screening in partially degenerate dense plasmas @xcite .",
    "the energy generation @xmath63 , per gram per second , is then obtained , zone by zone , from the rate multiplied by @xmath64 in the appropriate units . to get the change in the deuterium abundance during one time step",
    ", it is assumed that the planet interior is fully convective and therefore fully mixed .",
    "this assumption is valid for the planets considered during the phase of contraction and cooling , even if no deuterium is burned .",
    "the convective velocities of order 10 - 100  @xmath65 , calculated according to the mixing - length approximation , give a mixing time scale far shorter than the d - burning time scale .",
    "the reaction rate multiplied by zone mass is integrated over the entire envelope and used to calculate the abundance change .",
    "given the central stellar mass @xmath66 , the solid surface density @xmath16 , and the distance of the planet from the star @xmath67 , the isolation mass for the solid material is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of hill - sphere radii on each side of the planetary core from which it is able to capture planetesimals ; @xmath70 in our simulations .",
    "once the core mass approaches @xmath71 , the @xmath72 slows down drastically , and beyond that point , gas accretion continues and surpasses the core accretion rate .",
    "the core mass increases to a value of about @xmath73 at crossover , when @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this phase of relatively slow accretion rates onto both core and envelope is known as ` phase 2 ' .",
    "the epoch of rapid gas accretion in the core - nucleated accretion model generally begins soon after the envelope mass , @xmath75 , exceeds the core mass , @xmath76 , as can also be shown by means of simple thermodynamical arguments @xcite . in a proto - solar nebula at @xmath77 ,",
    "this condition typically occurs when the planet mass @xmath78 is between @xmath79 to a few tens of earth masses .",
    "after this point , the planet s envelope tends to contract very rapidly , limited only by the rate of energy escape at the surface , and a high rate of gas accretion is required to maintain the condition @xmath80 . at or about 0.25  m@xmath1 this condition",
    "can no longer be met , the rate is set by the ability of the protoplanetary disk to deliver gas to the planet , and @xmath31 contracts well within @xmath81 .",
    "there are various regimes of disk - limited gas accretion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "for the purpose of this study , we are mainly interested in the high - mass limit @xmath82 , where @xmath83{m_{p}/\\left(3m_{\\star}\\right)}$ ] is the hill radius of the planet and @xmath84 is the disk thickness at the planet s orbital radius , @xmath67 . in this regime , disk - limited accretion rates can be affected by disk - planet gravitational interactions if tidal torques overcome viscous torques .",
    "assume that the turbulent ( kinematic ) viscosity of the disk at the orbital distance of the planet is given by @xmath85 , where @xmath17 is the local keplerian rotation frequency of the disk and @xmath86 is the viscosity parameter .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "when the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : tor - con ] ) is much greater than the right - hand side , a gap forms in the disk surface density along the planet s orbital radius .",
    "we estimated disk - limited accretion rates , @xmath90 , using high resolution 3d hydrodynamical simulations of a planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "we used an approach along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we considered a disk with a constant aspect ratio of @xmath91 and with the parameter @xmath92 ranging from @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "the unperturbed surface density of the disk is taken to be a power - law of the distance from the star with exponent @xmath95 .",
    "the planet is kept on a fixed circular orbit and the continuity and navier - stokes equations ( written in terms of linear and angular momenta ) for the gas are solved in a reference frame co - rotating with the planet .    the disk is assumed to be vertically isothermal and , radially , the temperature drops as the inverse of the distance from the star . at the radial distance @xmath67 ,",
    "the temperature is @xmath96 , which is equal to @xmath97 at @xmath98 from a solar - mass star ( @xmath99 indicates the mean molecular weight of the disk s gas ) . the relatively simple equation of state adopted here ( the pressure @xmath100 , where @xmath59 is the mass density and the temperature @xmath101 is a given function of the orbital distance ) allows us to write the fluid equations in a non - dimensional form so that the gas accretion rates can be expressed in terms of @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the unperturbed gas surface density of the disk at the planet location ( i.e. , that the disk would have in the absence of the planet ) .",
    "furthermore , the planet s mass enters the calculations only via its ratio to the mass of the star .",
    "we considered values of the ratio @xmath104 up to @xmath105 .",
    "the planet s gas accretion rate starts to decline for planet masses greater than the value for which the inequality in equation  ( [ eq : tor - con ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this critical mass is larger within more viscous disks .",

    ", the disk domain extends in radius as close to the star as @xmath114 ( and @xmath115 , in some calculations ) and as far as @xmath116 .",
    "more vigorous perturbations exercised by larger mass planets cause the inner / outer disk radius to decrease / increase with increasing planet - to - star mass ratio .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma ] shows the surface density , averaged in azimuth , for a case in which @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "notice that the low densities in the disk inside the orbit of the planet are a consequence of tidal torques and planet accretion ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the analysis of @xcite , where applicable , suggests that the effects of the finite inner grid radius are small .    high resolution in and around the planet s hill sphere is achieved by means of multiple nested grids @xcite centered on the planet s position .",

    "the gas that orbits the planet deep within its gravitational potential is eventually accreted .",
    "we assume that gas can be accreted within a spherical region of radius @xmath123 ( or @xmath124 in some models ) , centered on the planet .",
    "the amount of accreted gas is proportional to the amount of gas available in the region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in these calculations ,",
    "accreted gas is removed from the computational domain but not added to the mass of the planet in order to achieve a stationary accretion flow ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we determined an interpolation procedure for the disk - limited gas accretion rates obtained from calculations , by performing piece - wise parabolic fits ( in a logarithmic plane ) to each @xmath125 data set , relative to a given value of the turbulent viscosity .",

    "the peak involves only a factor 2 increase in luminosity . in the peaks ,",
    "the total energy @xmath152 is found to agree closely with the total energy available from d - burning , given by the quantity @xmath153 , where @xmath64 , the energy production per reaction is expressed in ergs , @xmath154 is the mass of a deuterium atom , @xmath35 is the planet mass , @xmath155 is the initial mass fraction of deuterium , and @xmath156 is the fraction of the initial d that burned .",
    "the total energy is about @xmath157 ergs for the 12.5  m@xmath1 case .",
    "results for two runs whose final masses closely bracket @xmath2 are shown in table  [ table:2 ] .",
    "the main result of this case is that @xmath158  m@xmath1 with a heavy - element core mass of 16.8  m@xmath0 . by way of comparison , a cold start model with a core , calculated by @xcite with about the same basic parameters ( 1  m@xmath11 , @xmath133 , @xmath159 au ) , with a similar helium mass fraction of 28% , but with some differences in assumptions and computational procedure , gives @xmath160  m@xmath1 .",
    "the maximum @xmath142 at the core / envelope interface for @xmath2 in this case is close to @xmath143  k , a very sensitive function of mass .",
    "whether significant d - burning occurs depends sensitively on this temperature .",

    "if it reaches @xmath162  k , practically all ( 98% ) of the d is burned for the corresponding mass of 12.5  m@xmath1 .",
    "once the threshold is reached , energy deposition from burning increases the temperature , which increases the reaction rate , as it is proportional to @xmath163 .",
    "the resulting expansion leads to a near thermal equilibrium , with the energy produced from d - burning matched closely by the total radiated luminosity .",
    "run 1b differs from 1a only with respect to the calculation of the opacity resulting from grains in the protoplanetary envelope during the formation phase . as mentioned above , in run 1a this opacity is obtained through detailed consideration of grain settling and coagulation @xcite . in 1b",
    "a table of interstellar grain opacities is used , reduced by a factor of about 50 .",
    "the characteristics of this run , up to a mass of about 1  m@xmath1 , are very similar to those listed for run 1sg in @xcite .",
    "the crossover mass is 16.16  m@xmath0 , the crossover time is 2.31 myr , and the onset of disk - limited rapid gas accretion occurs at a core mass of 16.8  m@xmath0 and a time of 2.41 myr .",
    "note that the evolution time up to this point is 2.4 times longer than in run 1a .",
    "note also that the core mass is the same as in run 1a ; the substantial difference in opacity , which can be up to two orders of magnitude in certain ( @xmath164 ) regions , has practically no effect on the core mass .",

    "the luminosity as a function of time up to the end of accretion is shown in figure  [ fig : lum ] .",
    "the results for d - burning after that time show that @xmath165  m@xmath1 , not significantly different from the results of run 1a . as table",
    "[ table:2 ] shows , @xmath130 in run 1b , at the same final mass , is slightly higher than that in run 1a , just after formation .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath131 is slightly lower .",
    "these small differences indicate a slightly higher entropy for 1b after formation , as indicated by the slightly higher luminosity at this point .",
    "the increased envelope opacity in 1b as compared with 1a results in slower heat loss and tends to keep internal temperatures higher .",
    "however this effect is almost compensated by the fact that the formation time is more than twice as long in 1b .",
    "even the slight increase in @xmath130 in 1b as compared with 1a allows @xmath2 to be pushed to a slightly lower mass .",
    "run 1c differs from run 1a in that @xmath16 is reduced to @xmath166 , a value only slightly greater than that in a minimum - mass solar nebula @xcite .",
    "grain settling and coagulation are included in the opacity calculation .",
    "the earlier portions of this run , up to the onset of disk - limited gas accretion , are described in @xcite , their run @xmath167 .",
    "the time to reach this point , 3.5 myr , is considerably longer than in run 1a , first , because the core accretion rate is considerably lower , and second , because the lower isolation mass results in reduced luminosity and reduced gas accretion rate during phase 2 @xcite .",
    "the crossover mass is 4.09  m@xmath0 , and the core mass at the time of onset of disk - limited accretion is 4.74  m@xmath0 .",
    "the calculations were continued up to the point where gas accretion terminated , at which point the core mass was 4.8  m@xmath0 . the total time to reach 12",
    "m@xmath1 was about 4.1  myr , and to 14  m@xmath1 , about 4.5 myr .",
    "the peak disk - limited accretion rate was @xmath168  m@xmath0 yr@xmath137 at 0.3  m@xmath1 , a factor of 2.5 lower than in run 1a because of the reduction in @xmath103 by the same factor . by the time",
    "the total mass was 5  m@xmath1 the rate was down to @xmath169  m@xmath0  yr@xmath137 , and at 10  m@xmath1 it had further declined to @xmath170  m@xmath0  yr@xmath137 . much of the time during the disk - limited accretion phase was spent in accreting the last 12  m@xmath1 to reach the d - burning point .",
    "the luminosity as a function of time for this run , up to the end of accretion , is shown in figure  [ fig : lum ] .",
    "the luminosity versus time plots for run 1c during the d - burning phase look similar to those for 1a , except in this case m@xmath171 noticeably increases to 13.55  m@xmath1 .",
    "the reduced core mass in 1c ( 4.8  m@xmath0 ) as compared to that in 1a ( 16.8  m@xmath0 ) is clearly associated with the difference , in agreement with the results of @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "the core equation of state gives a core radius of @xmath172  cm for the run 1c core of mass 4.8  m@xmath0 when the total mass is 12 m@xmath1 .",
    "for the core of 16.8  m@xmath0 in run 1a , at the same total mass , the radius is @xmath173  cm .",
    "thus , at the core boundary , the gravitational potential is more negative , and the gravity is about 40% greater in 1a than in 1c .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath130 are @xmath174  k and @xmath175  k in runs 1a and 1c , respectively .",
    "it follows from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite that in a convective envelope the adiabatic temperature gradient at the interface should be proportional to the core gravity , so a higher gravity most probably gives a higher temperature . however , this statement is inconclusive .",
    "we calculated static models for a planet of 12  m@xmath1 , all with the envelope entropy of run 1c , with core masses ranging from 0 to 15  m@xmath0 .",
    "we found practically no difference in @xmath142 as a function of @xmath176 , with @xmath142 _ decreasing _ by less than 1% when the core mass increases from 0 to 15 @xmath177 .",
    "the real source of the difference in @xmath130 between runs 1a and 1c is the entropy in the envelope .",
    "the lower @xmath130 and higher @xmath131 for 1c as compared with 1a indicate a lower entropy , which is consistent with the fact that the luminosity just after formation is lower by more than a factor 2 in 1c ( table  [ table:2 ] ) .",
    "the values of entropy just after formation for a planet of 12  m@xmath1 in runs 1a and 1c are , respectively , 8.02 and 7.52 @xmath178 per baryon .",
    "the entropy is determined through the physical processes that occur during the entire formation phase ; for example , the formation time for run 1c is almost 4 times longer than that for 1a , and the same opacities were used , which suggests a lower entropy .",
    "thus there exists a qualitative understanding of the relation between core mass and @xmath130 , but a quantitative theory , apart from the numerical simulations , is quite difficult .    in run 1c ,",
    "@xmath179  k is the maximum reached for a final mass of 12  m@xmath1 , and it is insufficient for d - burning . in the case of run 1a",
    ", the corresponding @xmath130 is much closer to the threshold required for burning .",
    "thus the planet with the higher @xmath176 is able to produce significant d - burning at a lower total mass .",
    "as table  [ table:2 ] shows , in the mass range for run 1c where d - burning begins , just above 13.5  m@xmath1 , @xmath130 is somewhat less ( @xmath180  k ) than in the corresponding mass range for run 1a .",
    "however , to compensate , @xmath131 is higher , about @xmath181 , and the screening factor at the center has increased to 160 .",
    "again , the lower entropy at formation for 1c , as compared with 1a , a result of various processes associated with the accretion of core and envelope , leads to a higher @xmath2 .",
    "the formation phases of runs 2a and 2c , for a central star of 2  m@xmath11 , are illustrated in figure [ fig : lum ] , which gives the luminosity as a function of time , and figure  [ fig : mass ] , which gives the core mass , envelope mass , and total mass as a function of time .",
    "run 2a differs from 1a in that the planet is placed 9.5 au away from a star of 2  m@xmath11 , in a disk with @xmath182 . in a minimum mass solar nebula ,",
    "scaled to the mass of this star , the corresponding value would be @xmath183 .    the isolation mass , however is quite similar to that in 1a , 12.6 rather than 11.6  m@xmath0 .",
    "the opacity during the formation phase of 2a is taken from a table of interstellar grain opacities , reduced by a factor of 50 , as in run 1b .",
    "however , the comparison between 1a and 1b showed that these opacities have little effect on @xmath2 .",
    "the formation time is longer in 2a than in 1a because of the longer dynamical time at the larger distance , the reduced solid surface density , and the somewhat higher envelope opacity .",
    "however , these effects are partially compensated for by the smaller planetesimal size ( 50 km in 2a ; 100 km in 1a ) , which increases the capture cross section @xmath184 , and by the increased gravitational focussing factor @xmath18 at the larger distance .",
    "the first luminosity peak for run 2a ( figure  [ fig : lum ] ) occurs at @xmath185 yr , with log @xmath49/l@xmath186 , with @xmath187  m@xmath0 , with @xmath188  m@xmath0 , and with @xmath189  m@xmath11 yr@xmath137 .",
    "this peak corresponds to the maximum in the accretion rate of solids onto the core .",
    "the crossover mass ( figure  [ fig : mass ] ) of 17.6  m@xmath0 is reached in @xmath190 years .",
    "the second , much higher luminosity peak at @xmath191 yr corresponds to the phase of rapid gas accretion up to a final mass of 15  m@xmath1 . at that time the maximum gas accretion rate is @xmath192  m@xmath0  yr@xmath137 and @xmath193  m@xmath1 .",
    "formation is complete , up to 15  m@xmath1 , in @xmath194  yr .",
    "the final @xmath195  m@xmath0 is slightly higher than in run 1a .",
    "the luminosity as a function of time during the later deuterium - burning phase is shown for five different final masses in run 2a in figure  [ fig:4 ] . in the cases of 16 and 15  m@xmath1 ,",
    "practically all ( @xmath196% ) of the deuterium is burned ; in the case of 13.5  m@xmath1 , about 92% is burned ; for 13.0  m@xmath1 , 75% is burned , and for 12.0  m@xmath1 , just over 50% is burned .",
    "thus the value for m@xmath197  m@xmath1 is very close to the values obtained for runs 1a/1b despite substantial differences in assumptions and initial conditions . as discussed in the comparison between runs 1a and 1c , the somewhat larger @xmath176 in 2a as compared to 1a is the main reason for the slightly lower @xmath2 in 2a .",
    "after formation , 2a has a slightly higher @xmath130 than 1a and slightly lower @xmath131 , leading to a slightly higher entropy .    comparing the luminosity curves for a mass of 16  m@xmath1 in figures [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ]",
    ", they look very different but in fact they are consistent . in run 2a ( figure  [ fig:4 ] ) the higher @xmath130 ( because of the somewhat higher @xmath176 ) allows d - burning to start earlier than in run 1a , and the value of @xmath49 at the starting point is a factor of 4 higher .",
    "in fact the full widths of the two curves are quite similar , the peak values agree to better than a factor 2 , and the integrated luminosities over time of the two curves agree to within 10% .",
    "run 2b has exactly the same parameters as 2a except that @xmath86 is reduced by a factor 2.5 , which affects the gas accretion rates during the disk - limited phase .",
    "thus the formation time in 2b turns out to be a factor of 1.5 longer at @xmath198 years , but still within the range of observed disk lifetimes .",
    "table  [ table:2 ] shows that for final mass 12  m@xmath1 the fractions of deuterium burned are in agreement for runs 2a and 2b , within the uncertainties of the calculations .",
    "thus @xmath86 has practically no effect on @xmath2 in this case .",
    "run 2b has a slightly lower entropy than 2a at 12  m@xmath1 , 8.2 @xmath178 per baryon versus 8.25 , and therefore a slightly higher @xmath2 .",
    "thus it appears that the longer time during disk - limited accretion in run 2b has only a weak effect on both @xmath2 and the entropy , at the same @xmath176 .",
    "run 2c has the same parameters as 2a except that the solid surface density @xmath16 is increased by a factor 1.5 to @xmath199 .",
    "the first luminosity peak ( figure  [ fig : lum ] ) occurs at @xmath200 years with log @xmath49/l@xmath201 at @xmath202  m@xmath0 .",
    "the crossover mass ( figure  [ fig : mass ] ) is reached at @xmath203 yr with a value of 30.7  m@xmath0 .",
    "the maximum luminosity in the second peak is above log @xmath49/l@xmath204 , at @xmath205 years and a total mass of 0.62  m@xmath1 .",
    "the higher @xmath16 with respect to run 2a results in a markedly higher @xmath206  m@xmath0 and a markedly shorter formation time ( @xmath207 yr at @xmath2 ) . despite these relatively large differences ,",
    "the value for @xmath2 in 2c is only 2.5% smaller than in 2a . at the end of the formation phase ,",
    "central temperatures are higher and central densities are lower in 2c as compared with 2a . also , the screening factor is only 14 in 2c compared with 41 for 2a .",
    "the entropy at formation , for a final mass of 12  m@xmath1 , is higher in 2c , 9.08 @xmath178/baryon as compared with 8.25 , corresponding to a higher luminosity at that point .",
    "the slope in the ( @xmath208 ) diagram between @xmath176= 18.7 and 31  m@xmath0 is -0.024 , a result which differs somewhat from that of @xcite .",
    "they obtain a slope ( in the same units ) of -0.01 , although for a different core mass range , 30 to 100  m@xmath0 .",
    "plots of luminosity versus time are shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] for several different masses in run 2c .",
    "as in figure  [ fig:4 ] the higher masses give higher peak luminosity at earlier times than the lower masses , and at @xmath2 there is only a very small peak .",
    "the @xmath209 curve for 15  m@xmath1 starts at a higher value and reaches a maximum sooner than for the same mass in run 2a , because of the higher internal temperature , but the value of log @xmath49 at the peak is about the same . at 13.7 and 15",
    "m@xmath1 practically all of the initial d is burned . at 12  m@xmath1 ,",
    "72% is burned , while at 11.7  m@xmath1 , which is very close to @xmath2 , 61% is burned .",
    "plots of @xmath142 versus time , during the deuterium - burning phases , are shown for masses 12 and 15  m@xmath1 in figure  [ fig : tem ] , where they are compared with the results from run 2a .",
    "the plot shows the effect of varying the core mass at fixed total mass , and of varying the total mass at fixed core mass .",
    "for example , for run 2a at 15  m@xmath1 the maximum @xmath142 is @xmath210  k , while for 12  m@xmath1 it is only @xmath211  k and is reached at a much later time .",
    "the vertical portions of these curves show the effect of rapid gas accretion from about 1  m@xmath1 to the final mass of either 12 or 15  m@xmath1 .",
    "the two nearly horizontal curves are for a total mass of 12  m@xmath1 and core masses of 18.7 ( lower ; run 2a ) and 31  m@xmath0 ( upper ; run 2c ) .",
    "the higher core mass results in a higher temperature by a factor of about 1.3 . in the case of the 31  m@xmath0 core , about 75% of the deuterium is burned ; in the 18.7  m@xmath0 core , a little over 50% .",
    "note that the d - burning occurs late in the evolution , where small peaks in the temperature are seen .",
    "the remaining two curves correspond to a total mass of 15  m@xmath1 , with the same two core masses just mentioned .",
    "the d - burning occurs earlier than in the case of the lower total mass , and the higher core mass again gives a higher maximum @xmath142 . in both cases for 15  m@xmath1",
    "practically all the d is burned , and the residual mass fraction is smaller ( @xmath212 ) for the higher core mass as compared to the lower ( @xmath213 ) .    in run 2c with 15  m@xmath1 , @xmath142 goes up to about @xmath214  k and there are actually two minor peaks . figure  [ fig : llrt ] illustrates in more detail how various quantities vary during this phase . in this case , with a high @xmath130 , nuclear burning starts very early . during most of the phase ,",
    "the object is not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the first maximum in @xmath142 occurs when about 25% of the d has burned , close to the time of the maximum in the nuclear burning luminosity @xmath215 . here",
    "@xmath215 is well above the radiated luminosity @xmath49 , and the extra power goes into expansion , resulting in slight cooling of the interior . when half the deuterium has burned ( @xmath216 yr ) , there is a maximum in luminosity and radius , corresponding to the slight minimum in @xmath142",
    ". then contraction along with a slow decrease in nuclear burning leads to slight heating , and the second maximum occurs when 98% of the d has burned .",
    "this maximum corresponds to the time when @xmath215 starts to drop rapidly and to fall well below @xmath49 . beyond that point , even though contraction is occurring , there is insufficient burning to maintain the high temperature , and the object enters its final cooling phase . in contrast , in the case of 12  m@xmath1 , the main d - burning in run 2c takes place at practically constant @xmath142 , radius , and @xmath49 , with a slight maximum in @xmath142 of @xmath217  k at about @xmath144  yr . in this case the configuration is close to thermal equilibrium through most of the d - burning phase .",
    "the cross in figure  [ fig:5 ] gives the approximate location of the directly imaged companion @xcite to the well - known star beta pictoris .",

    "beta pic b s position in the ( log @xmath49 , @xmath220 ) diagram is plotted in @xcite where it is shown to fall on a theoretical track with mass 10  m@xmath1 as calculated from a ` hot start ' by @xcite . in http://exoplanet.eu that mass is given as 8 ( @xmath221,@xmath222 )  m@xmath1 .",
    "the surface temperature @xmath9 has been estimated from observed near infrared colors @xcite at 1700  k , with considerable uncertainty ( @xmath223  k ) .",
    "further infrared and astrometric observations @xcite are essentially in agreement , giving log ( @xmath49/l@xmath224 , @xmath225  k , @xmath226  au , and ` hot - start ' masses in the range 713  m@xmath1",
    ". the bolometric luminosity found by @xcite is in agreement with the above value , and they find ` hot - start ' masses in the range 712  m@xmath1 .    in our ` cold - start ' calculations",
    "the track for run 2c , 13.7  m@xmath1 , passes close to the object in the ( log @xmath49 , @xmath220 ) diagram , and the calculations give @xmath227  k at an age of 12  myr .",
    "our mass 10  m@xmath1 can not possibly provide a fit .",
    "the ` hot - start ' models thus would show that the object is a planet , as defined by an object with mass not high enough to burn deuterium .",
    "however this particular ` cold - start ' model indicates that beta pictoris b is presently burning deuterium , which , according to the same definition , would classify it as a brown dwarf .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sect : intro ] , this definition is not universally agreed upon ; an alternative definition , based on the minimum in the mass distribution of low - mass companions , observed within several au of sunlike stars , places the limit at @xmath228  m@xmath1 . in this case beta pic b would still be a planet .",
    "note that in the ` cold - start ' calculations , the fit at 13.7  m@xmath1 with an assumed @xmath229 is not unique ; the companion could also be fit at @xmath182 at a slightly higher mass , about 15.6  m@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , these masses are uncertain and will probably change when the calculations are redone in the future with more detailed model atmospheres .",
    "nevertheless , as such they are marginally consistent with the upper limits to the mass of beta pic b derived from radial velocity measurements @xcite . for a planet at 9 au the limit is 12  m@xmath1 ; at 10 au it is 15.4  m@xmath1 .",
    "we note also that the luminosity curve for 11.7  m@xmath1 in figure  [ fig:5 ] agrees well with the observed luminosity of the directly imaged planet hr 8799 c at the stellar age ( @xmath230 years ) . the observed value is given by @xcite as log @xmath49/l@xmath231 .",
    "the agreement of course requires a core mass of @xmath232  m@xmath0 . a hot - start model of about 10  m@xmath1 without a core also agrees .",
    "however we do not make a detailed comparison with hr 8799 c , because the metallicity of the star is low ( [ fe / h ] @xmath233 ) and the planet orbits at 43 au , making it highly debatable whether it could have formed by core - nucleated accretion .",
    "we investigate the boundary between brown dwarfs and giant planets , according to the definition that brown dwarfs can burn the deuterium that is present when they form , and giant planets can not .",
    "the main parameters and the results for @xmath2 , the boundary mass at which half of the original deuterium is burned after 4 gyr , are summarized in table  [ table:3 ] .",
    "the columns give , respectively , the run identification , the stellar mass in m@xmath11 , @xmath44 , the initial disk solid surface density @xmath16 at @xmath44 , the resulting @xmath176 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the main cases considered involve a planet / brown dwarf at 5.2 au around a solar - mass star , and a planet / brown dwarf at 9.5 au around a star of 2  m@xmath11 .",
    "the table shows that there is only a small variation in the values of @xmath2 , which , however , correlate with the core mass in the sense that the smaller the core mass , the higher the value of @xmath2 .",
    "the calculations , taken as a whole , indicate that the envelope entropy , which is a function of initial conditions and which is closely related to the core mass through the accretion processes during the formation phase , is an important factor in determining @xmath2 .",
    "however , certain physical processes during formation are shown to have only a small effect .",
    "run 1b has the same parameters as run 1a except that the dust opacity during the formation phase is higher by a factor that ranges from 2 to 100 , depending on the depth in the envelope .",
    "this difference has a negligible effect on @xmath2 .",
    "run 2b has the same parameters as 2a except that the disk viscosity during the phase of disk - limited gas accretion is lower by a factor 2.5 .",
    "this difference also has a negligible effect on @xmath2 .",
    "however the disk viscosity is important in another respect .",
    "if it is significantly lower than the range presented here ( @xmath234 ) , then there will not be time to accrete a planet with mass necessary to burn deuterium during the lifetime of the disk .",
    "the gas accretion rate onto a planet of 4  m@xmath1 around a star of 2  m@xmath11 , in a disk with @xmath235 , is reduced by a factor 400 compared with a disk with @xmath236 @xcite , corresponding to less than a jupiter mass in a million years for the initial conditions of run 2b ( formation time about 3 myr ) .",
    "of course the minimum viscosity required to build a planet up to about 12  m@xmath1 will depend on parameters such as @xmath16 and @xmath44 .",
    "this question is discussed in more detail in appendix  [ sec : acc - rates - fit ] .",
    "core accretion models , in the cold - start case , are known to have low entropy compared with hot - start models . in @xcite the entropy just after formation for 10  m@xmath1 was found to be 8.2 @xmath178 per baryon for @xmath237  m@xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity at ages of @xmath238 to @xmath144 years was about @xmath239 l@xmath11 , certainly fainter than observed values for directly imaged planets . in this mass range , for the given core mass , the entropy is very insensitive to the planet s total mass , as shown in that paper and confirmed by the present results .",
    "however our calculations show that the entropy is quite sensitive to the core mass , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : e ] ( a similar effect has been found independently by @xcite for @xmath240  m@xmath0 ) .",
    "the points shown are all calculated with the same total mass and the same disk viscosity . all",
    "used the reduced interstellar grain opacity , except for the point at @xmath241m@xmath0 , for which the grain - settling opacities were used ( if the interstellar opacities had been used , the formation time would have been considerably longer ) . however the comparison between runs 1a and 1b , which looked at the effect of changing the opacities , showed that the difference in entropy was less than 0.1 @xmath178 per baryon at the same total mass . the effect on the entropy of changing the viscosity ( runs 2a and 2b ) was even smaller .",
    "physical effects that do affect the entropy include the planetesimal accretion rate and the rate of contraction of the envelope , both of which affect the internal heating of the envelope .",
    "thus the luminosities of newly formed massive planets , depending on formation conditions , can vary by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "information on the runs whose entropies are plotted in the figure is given in table  [ table:4 ] .",
    "the table is in the same format as table  [ table:2 ] and gives the runs in order of decreasing entropy .",
    "clearly , for this set of models , a lower entropy is associated with a longer formation time .",
    "the luminosity plots for these four cases in figure  [ fig : lum ] illustrate the same effect .",
    "the combination of @xmath66 , @xmath44 , and @xmath16 determines the isolation mass , and thereby the ultimate core mass , which turns out to be a key factor in determining the entropy of the planet at formation .",
    "higher entropy , in particular the higher temperature , favors more rapid nuclear burning , so the higher entropy runs result in lower values of @xmath2 . nevertheless , the range of initial conditions explored here , which is considerable , produces only a small range in @xmath2 , about 11.613.6  m@xmath1 , in agreement with previous independent calculations .",
    "we can further conclude , that for cold - start core - accretion models that do burn deuterium , the tracks in the luminosity versus time diagram can potentially provide agreement with the properties of directly - imaged low - mass stellar companions .",
