    "pion production is the first and probably the simplest of the inelastic processes in nucleon - nucleon collisions and its understanding may provide us with valuable information about low and medium energy strong interaction physics .",
    "motivated by this , over the last decade there has been a series of detailed studies of the @xmath4 reaction from near the production threshold up to a proton beam energy of 425mev .",
    "these have been carried out at several laboratories , _ _",
    "viz.__iucf  @xcite , tsl  @xcite , and cosy - tof  @xcite .",
    "initial theoretical calculations  @xcite for @xmath5-production estimated a total cross section that was five times smaller than experiment  @xcite .",
    "this indicated clearly that some essential mechanism was missing from the theory of @xmath2-wave pion production leading to the @xmath6-state of the final protons .",
    "lee and riska  @xcite suggested that this might be connected with short - range effects between nucleons , and quantitative support for this was found in a model with the exchange of a heavy meson coupled to the antinucleon - nucleon pair  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it has been claimed that @xmath2-wave pion rescattering is not small  @xcite and that one can reproduce the cross section data without invoking short - range effects  @xcite .",
    "studies based on chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7pt )  @xcite show that the contribution of pion rescattering is indeed sizable , but that the sign of this term is opposite to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , and this leads to an even more severe discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "the convergence of the chiral expansion can be seriously questioned for @xmath2-wave pion production because of the large momentum transfer between nucleons , whereas the expansion seems to show convergence in the case of @xmath3-wave pion  @xcite .",
    "an ordering scheme has since been discussed @xcite .",
    "thus the origin of @xmath2-wave pion production is still not clear even as to whether the production mechanism is or is not dominated by short - range effects .",
    "differential cross sections and polarization observables have been measured at several bombarding energies  @xcite and theoretical estimates of these observable have been made by groups at jlich  @xcite and osaka  @xcite .",
    "both approaches include higher partial - waves and provide good fits to the total cross section close to threshold .",
    "however the differential and polarization observables are not well reproduced by either group . in order to try to identify the origin of the problem",
    "more clearly it may be useful to attempt a partial - wave decomposition . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the angular dependences of the different polarization observables were developed using a general formalism consisting of a complete set of functions , with coefficients extracted by fitting data , and this has been extended in later work  @xcite . however , due to the limited accuracy of polarization data existing at the time , the analysis was done by assuming that only a small number of partial - wave contributed and that the momentum dependence of these amplitude stemmed purely from the centrifugal barrier .",
    "this latter assumption is very doubtful since , for the @xmath8-state of final protons , it does not lead to a good description of the differential cross section  @xcite .",
    "more precise data on the angular and momentum dependence of the polarization observables , as well as of the differential cross section , are highly desirable",
    ". the accumulation of such data may allow one to perform a fuller partial - wave analysis of the @xmath4 reaction , which would provide greater insight for the theoretical models .",
    "we report here a measurement of the @xmath1 reaction at a beam energy of 390mev , where the beam polarization is perpendicular to the plane containing the detectors .",
    "the differential cross section and analyzing power , @xmath0 , are obtained as functions of the pion emission angle , @xmath9 , in the center - of - mass system and the relative momentum , @xmath3 , of the final protons .",
    "the use of a high intensity polarized beam in conjunction with a liquid hydrogen target makes it possible to extract the angular dependence of @xmath0 for different ranges in @xmath3 . such data , which have not been available previously , might offer serious constraints on theoretical models .    if only a few partial - waves are important , the angular dependence of the @xmath0 @xmath10 spin - averaged cross section is composed of terms proportional to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the strength of the @xmath11 term is governed by the interference of amplitudes corresponding to the production of @xmath13 and @xmath14 final states . here , using the standard notation , the final states are labeled by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the angular momenta of the proton pair and the pion , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath12 strength is determined by @xmath6- and higher states .",
    "the variation with the momentum @xmath3 , obtained after integration over angles , is sensitive to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 production amplitudes .",
    "this is studied in a model where it is assumed that the momentum dependence of the proton - proton wave functions in the final state is the main influence for the @xmath8-state amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , in a very simplistic approach , the wave functions are evaluated at a _ fixed _ proton - proton separation distance .    the experimental facility , and in particular the detectors , polarized beam , and target ,",

    "the experiment was carried out using a 390 mev polarized proton beam extracted from the cyclotron complex at the research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) , osaka .",
    "the polarized beam was produced by an atomic - beam - type polarized ion source with an electron cyclotron resonance ( ecr ) ionizer  @xcite , where the polarization state ( ` up ' or ` down ' ) of the primary beam was reversed with a frequency of 1hz .",
    "the protons were first accelerated in the injector avf cyclotron before being further accelerated up to 390 mev in the main cyclotron ring .",
    "after extraction , the vertically polarized beam was transported to the scattering chamber in the experimental hall .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] shows the top view of the scattering chamber as well as of our detection system .",
    "the scattering chamber containing a liquid hydrogen target consisted of an evacuated vertical cylinder .",
    "the window made of a aramid foil had a horizontal opening angle from 15@xmath18 to 110@xmath18 on either side of the the beam direction .",
    "after the target the primary beam was transported to the beam dump where a faraday cup monitored the beam intensity for the two polarization states .",
    "the beam current was limited to around 1na in order to minimize the dead - time of the data acquisition system . under these conditions",
    "the system , the details of which are described in ref .",
    "@xcite , had an efficiency of between 75% and 87% .",
    "the detector system was symmetric with respect to the plane containing the beam axis and the direction of the beam polarization .",
    "the two outgoing protons from the @xmath4 reaction were detected simultaneously in an array of plastic scintillators .",
    "the measurement of two pairs of polar and azimuthal angles and two kinetic energies is sufficient to identify the @xmath4 reaction and determine the five independent kinematic variables .",
    "the system covered laboratory polar angles @xmath19 .",
    "the maximum angle of protons from the @xmath4 reaction at 390mev ( @xmath20 ) is well inside the angular acceptance .",
    "the minimum angle was limited for both protons such that only proton pairs with relative momenta from 150mev/@xmath21 up to the kinematic limit of 220mev/@xmath21 could be registered with this system .",
    "the detector was therefore well suited for the investigation of the high relative momentum region , where the pion - production amplitudes leading to @xmath8-state proton pairs should have their maximum strength .",
    "however , it is important to note that the c.m .",
    "polar angle of the relative momentum vector for final protons was confined to @xmath22 with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the energy of a scattered proton was deduced from the amplitude signal in one of the @xmath23-counters .",
    "such a counter consists of a set of five plastic scintillators in which each element has a trapezoidal shape , with front and back faces of area @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the 350 mm length is sufficient to stop protons with energies up to 250mev so that all protons from the @xmath4 reaction at 390mev were stopped .",
    "the front face of each counter was positioned at 500 mm from the target .",
    "the scintillator hodoscopes in front of the counters were used to determine the directions of outgoing particles ; a single 3 mm thick element of area @xmath26 covered @xmath2717mrad horizontally and @xmath2730mrad vertically .",
    "two elements were placed in front of each of four @xmath23-counters with a 1 mm overlap , though only one element was used for the counter at the largest angle .",
    "there was thus a total of nine elements on each side of the beam .",
    "the angle of the detected particle was defined by the center of each element .    the anticoincidence counter ( marked ` anticounter ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) was used to eliminate accidental events coming from elastic proton - proton scattering .",
    "this covered the angular range @xmath28 , where recoil protons from the elastic scattering hit the counter in combination with the scintillator hodoscopes .",
    "the information from the counter was used in the offline analysis and about 90% of the accidentals could be suppressed in this way .",
    "one hodoscope element and a scintillation counter placed at 60@xmath291@xmath30 ( denoted as the ` polarimeter ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) were used to monitor the beam polarization .",

    ", the @xmath31 analyzing power at this energy and angle is @xmath32 , where the error bar has been obtained by looking at typical data in this region .",
    "the average values of the beam polarizations deduced on this basis were @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the arrows indicate the spin states of proton beam and the errors are statistical .",
    "the polarizations were quite stable during the experiment and all values lay within about @xmath35 of the averages .      the liquid hydrogen ( lh@xmath36 ) target was 8.5 mm thick , with windows made of 25@xmath37 m thick aramid foil  @xcite . its temperature was controlled in the range of 14k to 20k and kept stable at @xmath38k during experimental runs .",
    "the _ empty target _ runs , which were carried out with hydrogen gas at temperatures between 22k and 27k , were used to estimate the background from other construction materials as well as from the residual gas frozen on the windows .",
    "a signal was registered when a charged particle hit both of the scintillator hodoscopes and the corresponding @xmath23-counter . for the measurement of the @xmath4 reaction ,",
    "the trigger conditions were set so that both right- and left - side counters were required to give signals in coincidence . in addition , measurements without the coincidence requirement were also performed in order to detect single protons from elastic proton - proton scattering .",
    "such measurements were also performed using an unpolarized proton beam in order to check the determination of the luminosity as well as of the beam polarization .",

    "although the dependence of the cross section on the pion angle shows a larger anisotropy than in the case of data obtained with almost full acceptance  @xcite , this is in large part the result of our coplanar geometry . after taking this into account by using the iucf parameters  @xcite",
