    "molecules such as co or hcn have been commonly used as tracers of molecular gas in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "however , recent observations with the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite have shown strong spectroscopic signatures from other light hydrides , such as water , h@xmath3o@xmath4 , or hf , in nearby active galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these lines are blocked by the earth s atmosphere , but can be observed , redshifted , in distant galaxies using the current millimeter and submillimeter facilities .",
    "for example , @xcite have recently reported a detection of water in j090302 - 014127b ( sdp.17b ) at @xmath5 .",
    "one of the exciting recent results from hifi @xcite is the detection of widespread absorption in the fundamental @xmath2 rotational transition of hydrogen fluoride toward galactic sources @xcite .",
    "fluorine is the only atom that reacts exothermically with  @xcite .",
    "the product of this reaction , hf , is thus easily formed in regions where  is present and its very strong chemical bond makes this molecule relatively insensitive to uv photodissociation . as a result , hf is the main reservoir of fluorine in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , with a fractional abundance of @xmath6 relative to  typically measured in diffuse molecular clouds within the galaxy @xcite .",
    "interstellar hf was first detected by @xcite with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .",
    "the @xmath7 rotational transition was observed in absorption toward sagittarius  b2 , at a low spectral resolution using the long - wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) .",
    "the hifi instrument allows for the first time observations of the fundamental rotational transition of hf at 1.232476  thz to be carried out , at high spectral resolution .",
    "given the very large einstein a coefficient ( @xmath8  ps . ;",
    "critical density @xmath9  ) , this transition is generally observed in absorption against dust continuum background . only extremely dense regions with strong ir radiation field",
    "could possibly generate enough collisional or radiative excitation to yield an hf feature with a positive frequency - integrated flux .",
    "the hifi observations corroborate the theoretical prediction that hf will be the dominant reservoir of interstellar fluorine under a wide range of interstellar conditions .",
    "the hf @xmath2 transition promises to be a excellent probe of the kinematics of , and depletion within , absorbing material along the line of sight toward bright continuum sources , and one that is uncomplicated by the collisionally - excited line emission that is usually present in the spectra of other gas tracers . as suggested by @xcite , redshifted hf @xmath2 absorption may thus prove to be an excellent tracer of the interstellar medium in the high - redshift universe , although only the gas reservoir in front of a bright continuum background can be studied by means of the hf absorption spectroscopy .",
    "water is another interstellar molecule of key importance in astrophysical environments , being strongly depleted on dust grains in cold gas , but abundant in warm regions influenced by energetic process associated with star formation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the excited @xmath0 transition of p- , with a lower level energy of 137  k , has a frequency of 1.228788  thz and can be observed simultaneously with the @xmath2 transition of hf in high - redshift systems .",
    "consequently , we have searched for the hf @xmath2 and  @xmath0 transitions , redshifted down to 251  ghz , in apm  082791 + 5255 using the iram plateau de bure interferometer .    the broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar apm  082791 + 5255 at _ _",

    "iram pdbi high spatial resolution observations of the co @xmath13 and @xmath14 lines , and of the 1.4  mm dust continuum have been presented by @xcite .",
    "the line fluxes in the co ladder and the dust continuum fluxes are well fit by a two - component model that invokes a `` cold '' component at 65  k with a high density of @xmath15(h@xmath3 ) = @xmath16  @xmath17 , and a `` warm '' , @xmath18  k , component with a density of @xmath19  @xmath20 .",
    "wei  et al .",
    "argue that the molecular lines and the dust continuum emission arise from a very compact ( @xmath21  pc ) , highly gravitationally magnified ( @xmath22 ) region surrounding the central agn .",
    "part of the difference relative to other high-_z _ qsos may therefore be due to the configuration of the gravitational lens , which gives us a high - magnification zoom right into the central 200-pc radius of apm  08279 + 5255 where ir pumping plays a significant role for the excitation of the molecular lines .    high - angular resolution ( @xmath23 ) vla observations of the co @xmath2 emission in apm  08297 + 5255 @xcite reveal that the molecular emission originates in two compact peaks separated by 04 and is virtually co - spatial with the optical / near infrared continuum emission of the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "this morphological similarity again indicates that the molecular gas is located in a compact region , close to the agn . @xcite",
    "present a revised gravitational lens model of apm  08297 + 5255 , which indicates a magnification by only a factor of 4 , in contrast to much higher magnification factors of 100 suggested in earlier studies .",
    "their model suggests that the co emission originates from a 550  pc radius circumnuclear disk viewed at an inclination angle of 25 , or nearly face - on .",
    "the total molecular mass is then @xmath24  m.    @xcite first pointed out the importance of infrared pumping for the excitation of hcn in apm  08279 + 5255 .",
    "subsequent observations of @xcite reveal surprisingly strong @xmath25 emission of hcn , hnc , and  in the host galaxy , providing additional evidence that these transitions are not collisionally excited .",
    "@xcite argue that the high rotational lines of hcn can be explained by infrared pumping at moderate opacities in a 220  k warm gas and dust component .",
    "these findings are consistent with the overall picture in which the bulk of the gas and dust is situated in a compact , nuclear starburst , where both the agn and star formation contribute to the heating .    prior to the observations reported here",

    "some excess emission above the continuum level is seen near the frequency of the hcn  @xmath30 line , however , the result does not constitute a detection at the sensitivity limit of the present observations .",
    "in modeling the water line flux observed from apm  08279 + 5255 , we have computed the co and h@xmath3o line luminosities expected for an isothermal , constant density medium .",
    "we solved the equations of statistical equilibrium for the h@xmath3o and co level populations , making the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation and treating the effects of radiative trapping with an escape probability method .",
    "we adopted the rate coefficients of @xcite and @xcite , respectively , for the excitation of co and h@xmath3o in collisions with h@xmath3 , and we assumed an ortho - to - para ratio ( opr ) of 3 for both h@xmath3 and h@xmath3o .",
    "following @xcite , we neglect any effects of dust extinction upon the emergent co and  line fluxes ; although the dust optical depths at thz frequencies raise the possibility that such effects could be significant , their importance depends strongly on the geometry of the source and the spatial relationship between the warm dust and the molecular emission region . in galactic hot cores with  column densities comparable to that in apm  08279 + 5255",
    ", the para-  @xmath0 line can be seen with net - emission flux ( orion kl , ngc6334i ) , or in absorption ( sagittarius  b2 ) , depending on the specific source geometry .",
    "a mixture of such regions may contribute to the observed spectrum of apm  08279 + 5525 , leading to partial cancellation of the emergent line flux . using the relative strengths of the multiple co transitions observed by @xcite to constrain the gas temperature , density , and velocity gradient",
    ", we thereby obtained as best fit parameters the values @xmath41  k , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "these parameters are very close to those obtained previously by @xcite in their single component model for the co emission detected from this source .",
    "adopting the same parameters for the water emitting region , we have computed the para - h@xmath3o  @xmath44/co  @xmath45 line flux ratio as a function of the assumed @xmath46 abundance ratio . in the case of h@xmath3o , the pumping of rotational transitions by far - infrared continuum radiation can strongly affect the predicted line fluxes .",
    "the importance of radiative pumping in this source has been discussed previously by @xcite for the case of hcn , although , in that case , pumping takes place through a low - lying _ vibrational _ band .",
    "pumping through pure _ rotational _ transitions is relatively much more important for an asymmetric top molecule like water , because such molecules possess a more complex energy level structure than the simple ladder shown by spinless linear or diatomic molecules ( such as hcn and co ) ; furthermore , the lowest vibrational band of water lies at a considerably shorter wavelength ( @xmath47 ) than that of hcn ( @xmath48 ) , where the continuum radiation is considerably weaker .",
    "the dominance of radiative pumping in rotational transitions of water vapor was also discussed by @xcite , in their recent analysis of the water line emission observed by _",
    "herschel _ toward the starburst galaxy mrk  231 . under conditions where radiative pumping is dominant , the water line fluxes are almost independent of the gas temperature and density .",
    "following @xcite , we define @xmath49 as the sky covering factor of the infrared continuum source at the location of the molecular emission region ; the mean intensity is then given by modified blackbody of the form @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the planck function and @xmath52 . in figure",
    "[ fig : model ] ( upper left panel ) , we present the predicted para - h@xmath3o @xmath44 / co @xmath53 line flux ratio , as a function of @xmath46 and for several different values of @xmath49 : 0 ( red ) , 0.1 ( magenta ) , 0.25 ( blue ) , 0.5 ( black ) , and 1.0 ( green ) .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ fig : model ] clearly indicate the dominant role of radiative pumping ; a detailed analysis indicates the importance of the @xmath54 ( rest frame 2.97  thz ) transition in directly pumping the @xmath55 state of para - water , along with the @xmath56 ( rest frame 6.45  thz ) transition , which pumps the @xmath57 state ; the latter can decay subsequently to @xmath55 . dotted horizontal lines indicate the para - h@xmath3o @xmath44 / co @xmath53 ratio measured in apm08279 + 5255 and its uncertainty .",
    "the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : model ] shows entirely analogous results for the @xmath28 transition of ortho - water , with the horizontal dotted line indicating the 3 @xmath32 upper limit obtained by @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the results shown in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : model ] indicates that a limited range of parameters is permitted by the measured value of the @xmath58 line flux and the upper limit on @xmath59 . for the h@xmath3o opr of 3 assumed here ,",
    "acceptable fits are obtained for @xmath60 and @xmath46 in the range @xmath61 , although the range of acceptable parameters would obviously broaden if opr values smaller than 3 were permitted . in the regime of interest , the expected @xmath0 line fluxes depend only weakly upon the h@xmath3o abundance , the most important pumping transitions being optically - thick ; thus , the exact range of acceptable values for @xmath46 depends strongly upon our estimate of the likely error in the measured line flux .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath46 ratio inferred for an assumed opr of 3 is apparently smaller than that typically measured ( @xmath62 ) in hot core regions within our galaxy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "observations of additional transitions will be needed to constrain the water opr and abundance better .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig : model ] present results for several other transitions that are potentially detectable from ground - based observatories , some of which are more strongly dependent upon the water abundance .",
    "the results shown in these panels were all obtained for @xmath63 and opr=3 , and the labels indicate the rest frequencies and  in parentheses  redshifted frequencies in ghz .",
    "our results for transitions of para- and ortho - water appear , respectively , in the left and right panels .",
    "we note that our lvg solution for the  emission in apm  08279 + 5525 not only matches that of @xcite , using independent data , but the deduced velocity gradient @xmath64 for the  emitting region is close to the expected virial value , as defined for example by eq .",
    "( 5 ) of @xcite , @xmath65 ( i.e. the dense gas emitting in the  line emission is near virial equillibrium ) .",
    "the absence of detectable hf  @xmath2 absorption in apm  08279 + 5255 is unexpected , given the low column density of hf required to produce measurable absorption .",
    "an important caveat in this analysis is the assumption of a galactic hf/  ratio that , in turn , is related to the elemental abundance of fluorine .",
    "fluorine nucleosynthesis  and thus the evolution of the fluorine abundance in cosmic time ",
    "remains poorly understood , with production in agb stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , in wolf - rayet stars @xcite and neutrino - induced nucleosynthesis in type ii supernovae @xcite all proposed as possible mechanisms .",
    "while the face - on geometry of apm  08279 + 5255 is not favorable for absorption studies , the lack of hf absorption is still puzzling and may be indicative of a lower fluorine abundance in this source compared with the galactic ism .",

    "the para-@xmath44 line intensity in apm  8279 + 5525 is sensitive to the details of the excitation model .",
