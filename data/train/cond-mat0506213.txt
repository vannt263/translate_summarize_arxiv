    "it is one of currently important issues in the research field of condensed matter physics to unveil exotic magnetic properties of strongly correlated electron materials with active orbital degree of freedom . among those materials , in @xmath7-electron systems such as transition metal oxides , origin of complex magnetic structure has been vigorously discussed based on the concept of orbital ordering.@xcite also in @xmath0-electron materials including rare - earth and actinide elements , various kinds of magnetic and orbital ordering have been found.@xcite it is now widely recognized that orbital degree of freedom plays a crucial role for the emergence of novel magnetism in @xmath7- and @xmath0-electron systems .    here",
    "we should note that in @xmath0-electron systems , spin and orbital are not independent degrees of freedom , since they are tightly coupled with each other due to the strong spin - orbit interaction .",
    "then , in order to describe such a complicated spin - orbital coupled system , we usually represent the @xmath0-electron state in terms of `` multipole '' degree of freedom , rather than using spin and orbital degrees of freedom as in @xmath7-electron systems . among multipole moments ,",
    "there have been intensive and extensive studies on dipole and/or quadrupole ordering in @xmath0-electron systems . in usual cases ,",
    "magnetic ordering indicates dipole one , which can be detected by neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "ordinary orbital ordering means quadrupole one , which can also be detected experimentally , since it induces lattice distortions due to the spatial anisotropy in charge distribution .",
    "in addition to dipole and quadrupole ordering , in recent years , possibility of higher - order multipole ordering , i.e. , magnetic octupole ordering , has been also discussed for ce@xmath8la@xmath9b@xmath10 @xcite and npo@xmath11 , @xcite to reconcile experimental observations which seem to contradict one another at first glance .",
    "very recently , a possibility of octupole ordering has been proposed also for smru@xmath12p@xmath13 .  @xcite it is noted that in these materials , crystalline electric field ( cef ) ground states are @xmath14 quartets with large degeneracy even under a cef potential .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath14 ground - state multiplet , octupoles exist as independent moments besides dipole and quadrupole moments.@xcite then , phenomenological theories have been developed under the assumption that octupole ordering occurs .",
    "note that direct detection of octupole ordering is very difficult , since the octupole moment directly couples to neither a magnetic field nor lattice distortions .",
    "however , those phenomenological theories have been successful in explaining several experimental facts consistently , e.g. , induced quadrupole moments in octupole ordered states in ce@xmath8la@xmath9b@xmath10  @xcite and npo@xmath11.@xcite    as mentioned above , thus far , the study on multipole ordering in @xmath0-electron systems has been almost limited in the phenomenological level , mainly due to the complexity in the treatment of multipole degree of freedom . it might be possible to consider a heisenberg - like model for multipole moments , but the interactions among multipole moments were determined just phenomenologically .",
    "it is highly required to proceed to microscopic theory , in order to understand the origin of multipole ordering in @xmath0-electron systems .",
    "however , it is very hard and practically impossible to study multipole ordering in the model retaining all the @xmath0-electron states .",
    "then , it is necessary to consider a tractable model which keeps correct @xmath0-electron symmetry .",
    "one way for such model construction is to use an @xmath15 coupling scheme .",
    "for instance , the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interactions were estimated in dyzn ,  @xcite and in ceb@xmath10 and ceb@xmath11c@xmath11  @xcite from microscopic models using the @xmath15 coupling scheme . however , the method based on the @xmath15 coupling scheme is complicated and seems still hard to be extended .",
    "one reason for the difficulty is that we can not apply standard quantum - field theoretical techniques in the @xmath15 coupling scheme , since wick s theorem does not hold . from this viewpoint , it is recommended to use a @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme.@xcite since individual @xmath0-electron states are first defined , we can include many - body effects in systematic ways using theoretical techniques developed for the research of @xmath7-electron systems .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , in order to investigate how multipole ordering appears in @xmath0-electron systems from a microscopic viewpoint , we exploit the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .",
    "we construct tight - binding models on three kinds of lattices , simple cubic ( sc ) , bcc , and fcc , by including coulomb interactions among @xmath14 states . in order to discuss multipole ordering in these models ,",
    "we derive an effective multipole interaction model in the strong - coupling limit for each lattice structure by using the second - order perturbation theory with respect to @xmath0-@xmath0 hopping integrals , as to estimate the superexchange interaction in @xmath7-electron systems .",
    "then , within a mean - field approximation , we clarify what kind of multipole ordering occurs in the effective model : for the sc lattice , a @xmath3 antiferro - quadrupole transition occurs , while for the bcc lattice , @xmath4 antiferro - octupole ordering appears . for the fcc lattice with geometrical frustration , we find longitudinal triple-@xmath5 @xmath6 octupole ordering .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a tight - binding model based on the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme including only the @xmath14 states . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the general prescription to derive an effective hamiltonian from the @xmath14 model . in sec .",
    "iv , we show the mean - field results of the effective models on sc , bcc , and fcc lattices . finally , in sec .",
    "v , the paper is summarized .",
    "when we study theoretically the @xmath0-electron properties , the @xmath15 coupling scheme has been frequently used to include the effect of coulomb interactions , spin - orbit coupling , and cef potential . however , as mentioned above , it is not possible to apply standard quantum - field theoretical technique in the @xmath15 coupling scheme , since wick s theorem does not hold . in order to overcome such a difficulty ,",
    "it has been proposed to construct a microscopic model for @xmath0-electron systems by exploiting the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme,@xcite where we include first the spin - orbit coupling so as to define the state labeled by the total angular momentum @xmath2 . for @xmath0 orbitals with angular momentum @xmath16=3",
    ", we immediately obtain an octet with @xmath2=7/2(=3 + 1/2 ) and a sextet with @xmath2=5/2(=3@xmath171/2 ) , which are well separated by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "since the spin - orbital coupling is , at least , in the order of 0.1 ev for @xmath0 electrons , it is enough to take into account the @xmath2=5/2 sextet , when we investigate low - temperature properties of @xmath0-electron compounds in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .    in order to construct the many - body state",
    ", we accommodate @xmath0 electrons in the @xmath2=5/2 sextet by following the hund s rule interactions and cef potential , as we have done for @xmath7-electron systems .",
    "it has been found that the many - electron state obtained in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme is continuously changed to the corresponding state in the @xmath15 coupling scheme , as long as those states in both schemes belong to the same symmetry group.@xcite namely , if we based on the spirit of adiabatic continuation , there is no serious difference between the states of the @xmath15 and @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling schemes .",
    "depending on the problem , we can use one of the schemes for @xmath0-electron systems .",
    "for instance , if we attempt to explain phenomenologically the experimental results of @xmath0-electron insulators , it is highly recommended to use the @xmath15 coupling scheme . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme is rather appropriate to develop a microscopic theory for novel magnetism and unconventional superconductivity of @xmath0-electron systems . in the present paper ,",
    "our purpose is to construct a microscopic theory for multipole ordering from the viewpoint of spin - orbital complex .",
    "thus , we exploit the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme throughout this paper .    as described above , we consider only the states with @xmath2=5/2 .",
    "the @xmath2=5/2 states are further split into @xmath18 doublet and @xmath14 quartet due to a cubic cef . in order to consider multipole phenomena such as octupole ordering in @xmath0-electron systems from a microscopic viewpoint , in this paper we consider only @xmath14 states by assuming large cef splitting energy between @xmath18 and @xmath14 levels .",
    "this simplification is motivated by the fact that the possibility of exotic octupole ordering has been actively discussed in ce@xmath8la@xmath9b@xmath10 and npo@xmath11 with @xmath14 ground state .    here",
    "readers may be doubtful of the reality of our assumption , since the coulomb interaction among @xmath0 electrons is naively thought to be larger than the cef level splitting in any case .",
    "however , it should be noted that we are now considering the @xmath0-electron state in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme , not in the original @xmath0-electron state with angular momentum @xmath16=3 . as pointed out in ref .  , the hund s rule interaction in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme is effectively reduced to be 1/49 of the original hund s rule coupling .",
    "namely , even if the original hund s rule coupling among @xmath0 electrons is 1  ev , it is reduced to 200  k in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .",
    "we note that the cef level splitting in actinide dioxides is considered to be larger than 1000  k.  @xcite we also recall that the cef level splitting in ceb@xmath10 is as large as 500  k.  @xcite thus , we safely conclude that our present assumption is correctly related to the realistic situation .",
    "of course , in order to achieve quantitative agreement with experimental results , it is necessary to include also @xmath18 level , since the magnitude of the cef splitting is always finite , even if it is large compared with the effective hund s rule interaction .",
    "however , we strongly believe that it is possible to grasp microscopic origin of multipole ordering in @xmath0-electron systems on the basis of the @xmath14 model , since this model is considered to be connected adiabatically from the realistic situation . we postpone further effort to develop more general theory to include all the @xmath2=5/2 sextet in future .",
    "concerning the @xmath0-electron number , in this paper we treat only the case with one @xmath0 electron in the @xmath14 multiplet per site .",
    "however , this restriction does @xmath19 simply indicate that we consider only the ce - based compound . in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme , in order to consider @xmath20-electron systems , where @xmath21 indicates local @xmath0 electron number per site , we accommodate @xmath0 electrons in the one - electron cef levels due to the balance between coulomb interactions and cef level splitting energy , just as in the case of @xmath7-electron systems .",
    "thus , the situation with one @xmath0 electron in the @xmath14 multiplet per site expresses both cases with @xmath21=1 in the @xmath14-@xmath18 [ fig .",
    "[ figure : level_schemes](a ) ] and @xmath21=3 in the @xmath18-@xmath14 [ fig .",
    "[ figure : level_schemes](b ) ] systems , where @xmath22-@xmath23 symbolically denotes the situation with @xmath22 ground and @xmath23 excited states .",
    "furthermore , we should note that due to the electron - hole symmetry in the @xmath14 subspace , the effective model with one @xmath0 electron in the @xmath14 state is the same for that in the case with three electrons in the @xmath14 multiplet .",
    "namely , the present model also indicates both cases with @xmath21=3 in the @xmath14-@xmath18 [ fig .",
    "[ figure : level_schemes](c ) ] and @xmath21=5 in the @xmath18-@xmath14 [ fig .",

    "( b ) one electron in the @xmath14 for @xmath21=3 .",
    "( c ) one hole in the @xmath14 for @xmath21=3 .",
    "( d ) one hole in the @xmath14 for @xmath21=5 . ]    before proceeding to the exhibition of the hamiltonian , it is necessary to define @xmath0-electron operators in @xmath14 states .",
    "since the @xmath14 quartet consists of two kramers doublets , we introduce orbital index @xmath24 ( = @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) to distinguish the two kramers doublets , while spin index @xmath27 ( = @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) is defined to distinguish the two states in each kramers doublet . in the second - quantized form , annihilation operators for @xmath14",
    "electrons are defined as    @xmath30    for @xmath25-orbital electrons , and    @xmath31    for @xmath26-orbital electrons , where @xmath32 is the annihilation operator for an electron with the @xmath33-component @xmath34 of the total angular momentum at site @xmath35 .",
    "now we show the hamiltonian of @xmath14 electrons . for the purpose to consider the effective model later , it is convenient to express the hamiltonian in the form of @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the kinetic term of @xmath0 electrons and @xmath38 indicates the local interaction part for @xmath14 electrons . in this paper ,",
    "the kinetic term of @xmath14 electrons is given by exploiting the tight - binding approximation .",
    "then , @xmath39 is expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a vector connecting nearest - neighbor sites and @xmath42 is the hopping integral of an electron with @xmath43 at site @xmath35+@xmath41 to the @xmath44 state at @xmath35 .",
    "we note that the hopping integral @xmath42 depends on orbital , spin , and direction @xmath41 , due to @xmath0-electron symmetry .",
    "then , the form of the hopping integral is characteristic of lattice structure .",
    "the explicit form of the hopping matrix will be shown later for each lattice structure .",
    "note also the relation @xmath45 = @xmath42 .    as for the local @xmath0-electron term @xmath46 ,",
    "since we assume the large cef splitting energy between @xmath18 and @xmath14 levels , it is enough to consider the coulomb interaction terms among @xmath14 electrons . as easily understood from the introduction of ` spin ' and ` orbital ' in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme , the local @xmath0-electron term in the @xmath14 quartet",
    "becomes the same as that of the two - orbital systems for @xmath7 electrons .",
    "in fact , after lengthy algebraic calculations for racah parameters in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme,@xcite @xmath46 is given as @xmath47 where @xmath48 = @xmath49 and @xmath50=@xmath51 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 denote the intra - orbital coulomb , inter - orbital coulomb , exchange , and pair - hopping interactions , respectively .",
    "these are expressed in terms of racah parameters , and we obtain the relation @xmath52=@xmath56+@xmath54+@xmath57 , which can be understood from the rotational invariance in orbital space.@xcite note that for @xmath7-electron systems , one also has the relation @xmath54=@xmath57 . when the electronic wave - function is real , this relation is easily demonstrated from the definition of the coulomb integral .",
    "however , in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme the wave - function is complex , and @xmath54 is not equal to @xmath57 in general .",
    "in this section , we describe a method to derive an effective hamiltonian by using the second - order perturbation theory with respect to hopping integrals . here",
    "we emphasize that the procedure is essentially the same as to estimate superexchange interactions for @xmath7-electron systems , although the calculations are tedious due to the existence of orbital degree of freedom .",
    "after that , we will apply the standard mean - field theory to the effective model to depict the phase diagram including multipole ordered states .",
    "we believe that it is meaningful to understand the complicated @xmath0-electron multipole problem by using a simple @xmath7-electron - like procedure and approximations , both from conceptual and practical viewpoints .    when the hamiltonian is written in the form of eq .  , first we solve the local problem @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the @xmath21-th eigenenergy and @xmath60 is the corresponding eigenstate with a label @xmath61 to distinguish the degenerate states .",
    "since we accommodate one electron per site , the ground state @xmath62 is expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the vacuum state of @xmath0 electrons , @xmath61 denotes the electron configuration in the ground state with one electron per site , and @xmath65 takes 0 or 1 depending on the configuration @xmath61 .",
    "here we consider the formal perturbation expansion in terms of @xmath66 in order to construct the effective model . within the second order , @xmath67",
    "is generally written as @xmath68 where @xmath61 and @xmath69 are labels to distinguish the ground states , while @xmath70 is the label for the degenerate excited states .",
    "since we consider the situation with one electron per site , the intermediate state due to one - electron hopping has a vacant and a double occupied site .",
    "the double occupied site has six possible states , composed of @xmath71 triplet with energy @xmath56@xmath17@xmath54 , @xmath72 doublet with energy @xmath56+@xmath54(=@xmath52@xmath17@xmath57 ) , and @xmath73 singlet with energy @xmath52+@xmath57 . for the mathematical completion ,",
    "it is necessary to include all possible excited states in the intermediate process , but the calculation becomes complicated .",
    "then , in this paper , in order to grasp the essential point of the @xmath14 model by avoiding tedious calculations , we include only the lowest - energy @xmath71 triplet among the intermediate @xmath74 states .",
    "this restriction to the intermediate states is validated , when @xmath54 is much larger than the hopping energy of @xmath0 electron . since the @xmath0-electron hopping amplitude is considered to be small compared with @xmath54 , even if we also include the hybridization with conduction electrons , this approximation is acceptable in @xmath0-electron systems .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as already mentioned in ref .  , it is necessary to analyze the effective model carefully for the fcc lattice , since the model includes geometrical frustration .",
    "it is risky to apply directly the mean - field approximation to the effective model .",
    "first we evaluate the correlation function in the ground state using an unbiased method such as exact diagonalization on the @xmath75-site lattice . here",

    "[ figure : correlation_function ] ( b ) , we show results for the correlation functions .",
    "the interaction between @xmath4 moments ( @xmath78 ) is large , but the correlation function of the @xmath4 moment is not enhanced , indicating that the frustration effect is significant for an ising - like moment such as @xmath4 .",
    "we find large values of correlation functions for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 moments at @xmath82=@xmath83 . however , there is no term in the effective model which stabilizes @xmath81 quadrupole order at @xmath82=@xmath83 .",
    "we note that either of @xmath84 and @xmath6 ordered states can accompany @xmath85 quadrupole moments .",
    "thus , the enhancement of @xmath81 correlation function indicates an induced quadrupole moment in @xmath84 or @xmath6 moment ordered states .",

    "next we study the ordered state by applying mean - field theory to the simplified model including only @xmath86 and @xmath87 . since the coupling constant @xmath87 is slightly larger than @xmath86 , @xmath6 ordered state should has lower energy than @xmath84 ordered state .",
    "the interaction @xmath87 stabilizes longitudinal ordering of the @xmath6 moments , i.e. , @xmath90 .",

    "then , it has been found that the structure in the multipole interactions of the effective model derived from the @xmath0-@xmath121 model is qualitatively the same as those obtained in the @xmath14 model on the fcc lattice .",
    "in fact , we have found a finite parameter region of @xmath6 antiferro - octupole phase .",
    "namely , the @xmath0-@xmath121 model on the fcc lattice has a tendency toward @xmath6 antiferro - octupole ordering , which has been already captured in the simple @xmath1 model .",
    "this result suggests that the structure in multipole interactions is determined mainly by the symmetry of @xmath0-electron state .",
    "most of the effect of hybridization can be included by changing effectively @xmath1 in the multipole interactions shown in the present paper .",
    "however , if the itinerant nature of @xmath0 electrons is increased due to the large hybridization and metallicity of the ground state becomes significant , the present approximation inevitably loses the validity and the effect of the conduction band should be important . in such a case , it is necessary to develop a theory on the basis of the orbital - degenerate periodic anderson model in order to include the multipole fluctuations .",
    "it is one of future tasks .",
