    "the strong coupling constant and the quark masses are the basic input parameters for the theory of strong interaction .",
    "quark masses are an essential input for the evaluation of weak decay rates of heavy mesons and for quarkonium spectroscopy .",
    "the prediction of these masses is an important task for all variants of grand unified theories . to obtain the values in a consistent way from different experimental investigations is thus a must for current phenomenology .    during the past years",
    "new and more precise data for @xmath0 have become available in the low energy region between 2 and 10  gev . at the same time",
    "increasingly precise calculations have been performed in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , both for the cross section as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath8 , including quark mass effects , and for its moments which allow for a precise determination of the quark mass .",
    "a fresh look at the determination of the strong coupling and the quark masses based on these new developments is thus appropriate .    for the determination of @xmath1 we shall use energy regions sufficiently far away from the threshold where pqcd plus local duality is expected to give reliable predictions . for the determination of the quark masses we will use sum rules where the input depends heavily on the threshold region with its rapidly varying cross section .",
    "sum rules as tool to determine the charm quark mass have been suggested by the itep group long ago  @xcite .",
    "subsequently these methods have been developed further  @xcite and frequently applied to the bottom quark .",
    "most of these later analyses concentrated on using relatively high moments which are less sensitive to the continuum contribution and exhibit a very strong quark mass dependence .",
    "however , this approach requires the proper treatment of the threshold , in part the resummation of the higher order terms of the coulombic binding and a definition of the quark mass adopted to this situation like the potential- or @xmath9-mass  @xcite .",
    "recently improved experimental results in the charm threshold region have become available  @xcite , and at the same time the moments have been evaluated up to order @xmath10",
    "@xcite . a fresh look at the evaluation of the charm quark",
    "mass with the help of sum rules is thus an obvious task .",
    "we will concentrate on low moments , say up to the fourth one and present the results for the fifth to the eighth moment just for illustration .",
    "this is a natural route to determine directly a short distance mass , say @xmath11 or even @xmath12 in the @xmath2 scheme as advocated in the original papers  @xcite . in the present work we concentrate on the mass in the @xmath2 scheme , @xmath13 , and adopt @xmath14  gev as our default value , a scale characteristic for the present problem and sufficiently high to ensure convergence of the perturbative series . as already discussed in  @xcite",
    ", fixed order pqcd is adequate , if only low moments are used in the analysis .",
    "recently the determination of the charm quark mass got quite some attention . in  @xcite the pole mass @xmath15",
    "has been determined from the comparison of the direct determination of the hadronic contribution to @xmath16 with the determination using analytical continuation .",
    "this leads to the range @xmath17  gev  @xcite .",
    "the pole mass has also been determined in  @xcite using qcd sum rules in combination with nonrelativistic qcd .",
    "their result reads @xmath18  gev and is significantly higher than the one of ref .",
    "the @xmath2 mass given in  @xcite reads @xmath19  gev . on the basis of so - called chauchy sum rules , recent experimental data and analytical results for the three - loop photon polarization function",
    "the @xmath2 charm quark mass has been determined in  @xcite with the result @xmath20  gev . in  @xcite pseudo - scalar sum rules",
    "have been used to determine simultaneously the decay constant @xmath21 and the charm quark mass . for the latter the value @xmath22  gev",
    "is given in the abstract of  @xcite which is significantly lower than the other evaluations .",
    "we also want to mention that there is a recent lattice evaluation of the charm quark mass  @xcite with the result @xmath23  gev .",
    "the first error corresponds to the statistical and the second one to the systematical uncertainty . note that this result is derived in quenched qcd and the corresponding uncertainty is not included .    in the remaining part of the introduction we would like to fix the notation and define the quantities we are dealing with in the remainder of the paper .",
    "it is convenient to normalize the radiatively corrected hadronic cross section and to define the ratio @xmath24 where @xmath25 . as an inclusive quantity @xmath26",
    "is conveniently obtained via the optical theorem from the imaginary part of the polarization function of two vector currents via @xmath27    \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is defined through @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the electromagnetic current .",
    "the perturbative expansion of @xmath26 can be written as @xmath31 where the summation is performed over all active quark flavours @xmath32 .",
    "( we ignore the small singlet contribution at order @xmath33 . ) for a comprehensive compilation of the individual pieces we refer to  @xcite where also explicit results are given .",
    "we want to stress that the full quark mass dependence is available up to order @xmath10  @xcite . in the case of @xmath34 the first three terms in the high - energy expansion",
    "are known  @xcite .",
    "our theoretical predictions are based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) where the up , down and strange quark masses are taken to be massless and for the charm and bottom quark the respective pole masses are chosen as input . if not stated otherwise we will use the following input values for the evaluation of @xmath26 @xmath35 which cover the full range of all currently accepted results .    at several places of our analysis the renormalization group functions and the matching conditions for the masses and the strong coupling are needed in order to get relations between different energy scales .",
    "the corresponding calculations are performed using the package rundec  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : r ] we compare the experimental data of @xmath26 with the theoretical prediction and determine @xmath1 from the continuum data below @xmath36  gev and above @xmath37  gev .",
    "the measurement in the charm threshold region is used for the determination of the charm quark mass in section  [ sec : charm ] .",
    "similar considerations are used in section  [ sec : bottom ] in order to obtain the bottom quark mass .",
    "section  [ sec : con ] contains our conclusions .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we distinguish two energy regions : first , the continuum region where pqcd and local duality are expected to give reliable predictions for the hadronic cross section and , second , the charm threshold region starting from the @xmath38 meson threshold at @xmath39  gev up to approximately @xmath40  gev , where the cross section exhibits rapid variations , plus the @xmath41 and @xmath42 resonances .",
    "the former will be mainly sensitive to the value of @xmath1 .",
    "the latter will be used to evaluate moments and to determine the charm quark mass . for the present analysis the continuum region covers the bes data points from @xmath43  gev up to @xmath39  gev and the data from bes  @xcite , md-1  @xcite and cleo  @xcite between @xmath44  gev and @xmath45  gev% , @xmath46% and @xmath43% , respectively .",
    "older measurements , in particular those from spear and doris , are consistent with the new results . however , with their significantly larger errors they do not provide additional information . ] . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] pqcd with @xmath47 provides an excellent description of all recent results .",
    "c    below @xmath39  gev only @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 quarks are produced and the @xmath51 approximation for massless quarks is adequate for a description of @xmath52 .",
    "the effective number of flavours is chosen to be @xmath53 and virtual charm quark effects are taken into account ( for a compilation of the relevant formulae see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . above charm",
    "threshold @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 quark production is calculated as before , however , with @xmath54 . up to @xmath55",
    "the prediction for the charm quark production incorporates the full @xmath15 dependence .",
    "starting from order @xmath10 also the @xmath15 dependence of `` secondary '' charm production has to be taken into account .",
    "this includes diagrams of the type in fig .",
    "[ fig : gacc](a ) as well as those from fig .",
    "[ fig : gacc](b ) .",
    "in addition we include @xmath51 terms from the expansion in @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "last not least contributions from virtual @xmath58 quarks ( @xmath59  gev ) and @xmath60 quarks ( @xmath61  gev ) have been calculated which are suppressed @xmath62 and decouple for @xmath63 .",
    "these are included in the fifth column of tab .",
    "[ tab : r ] .",
    "pure qed final state radiation is tiny and taken into account for completeness .",
    "( for a related analysis at @xmath64  gev see  @xcite . )    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "recent experimental data for the total cross section @xmath0 have been compared with the up - to - date theoretical prediction of perturbative qcd for those energies where perturbation theory is reliable .",
    "the excellent agreement justifies the determination of the strong coupling @xmath1 from the measurements in the energy region between 2 and 3.73  gev below the charm threshold and the region between 4.8 and 10.52  gev above charm and below the bottom threshold .",
    "our result @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath66 and serves as a useful cross check in the intermediate energy region but is less precise than those from @xmath67- or @xmath68-boson decays .",
    "the direct determination of the short distance @xmath2 charm quark mass is performed with the help of the precise data from the charm threshold region and the three loop evaluation of moments in pqcd .",
    "using low moments the approach is insensitive to the coulombic behaviour of the cross section close to threshold and to nonperturbative condensates .",
    "the results based on different moments are quite consistent and the moment with @xmath69 exhibits the least sensitivity towards the parametric dependence on @xmath1 and the renormalization scale . as our final result",
    "we obtain @xmath5  gev .",
    "the same approach when applied to the bottom quark gives @xmath6  gev .",
    "these values are compatable with but more precise than other recent analyses .",
