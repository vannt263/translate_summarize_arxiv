    "quantum generalisations of classical heat cycles have now been studied for some years . when the working medium is a few - level quantum system , new lines of enquiry open up due to additional features like discreteness of states , quantum correlations , quantum coherence and so on @xcite .",
    "many models have served to investigate the validity of second law of thermodynamics in the quantum regime@xcite .",
    "the possibility of small scale devices and information processing machines @xcite has generated further interest into the fundamental limits imposed on the heat generation , cooling power and thermal efficiencies achievable with these models @xcite .",
    "quantum analogues of carnot cycles , otto cycles and other brownian machines have been analysed @xcite .",
    "further , both infinite @xcite and finite - time @xcite thermodynamic cycles have attracted attention .",
    "the quantum otto cycle which occupies our interest here consists of a working substance with hamiltonian @xmath0 and initial density matrix @xmath1 being manipulated between two heat reservoirs ( the reservoir temperatures satisfy @xmath2 ) under two adiabatic and two isochoric branches . on the adiabatic branches ,",
    "the system is assumed to follow quantum adiabatic theorem and thermodynamic work is defined in terms of the change in energy levels at given occupation probabilities .",
    "if the hamiltonian is changed from @xmath3 to @xmath4 by controlling an external parameter then the work performed is defined as @xmath5 $ ] . on the other hand , while traversing the isochoric branches , heat is exchanged with the reservoirs .",
    "thus if the density matrix of the system changes from @xmath6 to @xmath7 for a given hamiltonian @xmath0 , then heat exchanged is @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "as an example , for an effectively two - level system whose energy splitting can be varied from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , the otto efficiency has been found to be @xmath11 , which is bounded from above by carnot value due to the condition @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "recently , some authors have studied the role of different quantum interactions using spin-1/2 particles in a quantum otto cycle @xcite .",
    "in particular , the role of quantum entanglement has been conjectured using measure like concurence and the second law has been shown to hold in such models . in this paper , we also investigate a coupled otto engine using a 1-d heisenberg model with isotropic exchange interactions between two spin-1/2 particles ( see eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) below ) . in @xcite",
    "the same model was analysed , where during the adiabatic steps , the exchange constant @xmath13 was altered between two chosen values ( @xmath14 ) , while keeping the external magnetic field at a fixed value . from an experimental point of view , it is also interesting to investigate a cycle where the exchange constant is fixed and only the magnetic field is varied during the adiabatic steps .",
    "further , the uncoupled model cycles considered earlier in literature can be taken as a benchmark with which to compare the engine performance of the coupled model .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the quantum model of our working medium , enumerating the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues . in iia ,",
    "the various stages of the heat cycle are described and expressions for heat exchanged with reservoirs and work delivered are calculated .",
    "it is instructive to develop the engine operation based on local description .",
    "it is shown that all the work is done locally by each spin . in subsections iiia and iiib",
    "we develop two cases i ) @xmath15 and ii ) @xmath16 .",
    "the latter case is possible only in the presence of interactions .",
    "it is observed for this case that second law of thermodynamics can be violated at the local scale .",
    "general conditions are derived when the efficiency is higher than the noninteracting model .",
    "we also present an upper bound for efficiency which is lower than the carnot bound .",
    "the proof is sketched in the appendix . in iiic , we interpret some nontrivial features of the engine operation in terms of local spin temperatures . the final section iv summarises our findings .",
    "the working medium for our qhe consists of two spin-1/2 particles within the 1d isotropic heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the pauli matrices , @xmath19 is the exchange constant and @xmath20 is the magnetic field along @xmath21-axis .",
    "cases @xmath22 and @xmath23 correspond to antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we consider antiferromagnetic case only .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of @xmath24 are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the state of the spin along and opposite to the direction of the magnetic field respectively , then in the natural basis @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , we can write the density matrix as @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the maximally entangled bell states . the occupation probabilities of the system in the thermal state at temperature @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 where , @xmath39 is the normalisation constant .",
    "the four stages invloved in our quantum otto cycle are described below : + _ stage 1 _ : the system with the external magnetic field at @xmath40 attains thermal equilibrium with a bath of temperature @xmath41 .",
    "let occupation probabilities be @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 as tabulated above with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "_ stage 2 _ : the system is isolated from the hot bath and the magnetic field is changed from @xmath40 to @xmath48 by an adiabatic process . according to quantum adiabatic theorem , the process should be slow enough to maintain the individual occupation probability of each energy level .",
    "_ stage 3 _ : the system is brought in thermal contact with a cold bath at temperature @xmath49 . upon attaining equilibrium with the bath ,",
    "the occupation probabilities become @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 corresponding to the thermal state with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . on the average ,",
    "the system gives off heat to the bath .",
    "_ stage 4 _ : the system is removed from the cold bath and undergoes another quantum adiabatic process which changes the magnetic field from @xmath48 to @xmath40 but keeps the probabilities @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 unaffected . finally , the system is brought back to touch the hot bath . on the average , heat is absorbed from the bath and the system returns to its initial state .",
    "the heat transfered in _ stage 1 _ and in _ stage 3 _ of the cycle respectively is @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the above , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) are the energy eigenvalues of the system in _ stage 1 _ and _ stage 3 _ respectively . @xmath65 and @xmath66 corresponds to absorption of heat from hot bath and release of heat to cold bath respectively .",
    "comparing the equations for heat transfer between the system and the reservoirs , eqs .",
    "( [ q1 ] ) and ( [ q2 ] ) , the quantity of heat @xmath67 appears in both the equations .",
    "obviously , this term is absent in the uncoupled case for which @xmath68 . as will be shown below",
    ", the sign ( @xmath69 ) of this term determines whether the efficiency in the coupled case will be higher or lower than the uncoupled case .",
    "the work is done in _ stage 2 _ and _ stage 4 _ when the energy levels are changed at fixed occupation probabilities .",
    "the net work done by the qhe is @xmath70 note that @xmath71 corresponds to work performed by the system .",
    "in this section , we discuss how the individual spins in the system undergo the cycle . again , let @xmath72 and @xmath73 represent the thermal states in the natural basis when the system is in equilibrium in _ stage 1 _ and _ stage 3 _ respectively . explicitly , the density matrices are @xmath74 @xmath75 let @xmath76 and @xmath77 be the reduced density matrices in _ stage 1 _ for the first and the second spin , respectively . then from the normalization constraints , @xmath78 , we get @xmath79 similarly in _ stage 3 _ , the reduced density matrices for the first and second spin are @xmath80 since the applied magnetic field is the same for each spin , their local hamiltonian is also same .",
    "let @xmath81 and @xmath82 be the local hamiltonians for individual spins with eigenvalues @xmath83 and @xmath84 in _ stage 1 _ and _ stage 3 _ respectively .",
    "the heat transferred locally between _ one _ spin and a reservoir is given by @xmath85 for the hot and the cold reservoir , respectively .",
    "so we get the net work done by an individual spin as @xmath86 from eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) @xmath87 thus the total work performed is the sum of work obtained from the two spins locally .",
    "further , the total heat absorbed by the system can be written as @xmath88 and similarly for the heat released to the cold bath is @xmath89 now it can be seen that because the work is done only due to change in local hamiltonians , so only the part of the heat which is absorbed locally by a spin can be converted into heat . the part @xmath67 can not potentially be converted into work due to the nature of the adiabtic process involved and is transferred directly between the reservoirs .",
    "but it may not be transfered only from the hot to the cold bath , in which case it may be regarded like a heat leakage term .",
    "in fact , the flow of this heat can be in the opposite direction which is directly related to the enhancement of efficiency due to coupling , as shown below .    in the following , we consider two cases whereby magnetic field may be decreased or alternately , increased in stage 2 .",
    "it will be seen that the second case is feasible only in the presence of interactions , @xmath90 . in the first case",
    "when @xmath91 , the above equations go back to those for kieu s model with two uncoupled spins where an engine operation is obtained given @xmath92 and @xmath15 with the additional condition @xmath93 .      from eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , the condition that the work performed be positive ( @xmath71 ) is given by @xmath95 secondly , for the heat to be absorbed from the hot bath ( @xmath96 ) , from eq .",
    "( [ q1 ] ) we have one of the following two possibilities : ( i ) @xmath97 or ( ii ) @xmath98 .",
    "alongwith the possibility ( ii ) , we must also have @xmath99 .",
    "now we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ q1 ] ) as @xmath100 or @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the efficiency of the coupled engine and @xmath103 is the efficiency of the uncoupled i.e. @xmath68 case .",
    "thus for @xmath104 , if @xmath97 , then @xmath105 , or the presence of coupling between the spins decreases the efficiency from its value @xmath106 .",
    "the global efficiency is equal to the local efficiency in two situations , when @xmath68 or @xmath107 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath98 , then it is possible that the efficiency of the coupled engine can be higher than the uncoupled case . using the latter condition with eq .",
    "( [ pow ] ) , we have @xmath108 from the explicit expressions for the probabilities , the above inequality can be simplified to give @xmath109 thus we see that the above condition which is necessary to extract work in the @xmath68 model is _ also _ the condition for the coupled case to obtain an efficiency higher than @xmath106 .",
    "but additionally , for a set of given values of @xmath41 , @xmath49 , @xmath40 and @xmath48 , there is a maximum value of @xmath13 beyond which the efficiency drops below the @xmath106 value .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    , for @xmath15 case , for values @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the uncoupled case corresponds to @xmath114 .",
    "the upper curve denotes the bound for efficiency from eq .",
    "( [ etabound ] ) . beyond the maximum shown value of @xmath13 , the efficiency drops monotonically .",
    "the carnot limit is 0.5.,width=302 ]    the reason for the lowering of efficiency when @xmath115 , is that the term @xmath67 is positive and it acts like heat leakage term which reduces the efficiency . on the other hand , when @xmath116 , this term is negative which means that although each spin locally absorbs heat equal to @xmath117 from the hot bath , due to interaction the effective total heat absorbed by the two - spin system is less than @xmath118 , which raises the efficiency for a given quantity of the work performed .",
    "it is interesting to know how much maximum gain in efficiency is possible for a given set of parameters .",
    "we have proved an upper bound for the global efficiency , given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the carnot bound .",
    "also for @xmath121 , we have the condition @xmath122 .",
    "this implies that the ordering of energy levels which gives an enhancement of efficiency ( over the uncoupled model ) is : @xmath123 and which after the first quantum adiabatic process , becomes @xmath124 the proof of eq .",
    "( [ etabound ] ) is given in the appendix .",
    "in this case , during the first quantum adiabatic process , the magnetic field is _ increased _ from its value @xmath40 to @xmath48 .",
    "if there is no interaction between the spins , the system can not work as an engine in this case because the condition @xmath71 will not be satisfied @xcite .",
    "the conditions @xmath125 and @xmath126 directly lead to @xmath127 further , the positive work condition implies @xmath128 , which alongwith ( [ p4 ] ) gives @xmath129 the normalisation of probabilities and the above three conditions eqs .",
    "( [ p4 ] ) , ( [ p3 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) together give @xmath130 these are the necessary conditions for the system to work as an engine given that @xmath2 and @xmath16 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , the local work should be positive .",
    "this yields @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "this means locally the heat is absorbed from the cold bath and given to the hot bath .",
    "also the local efficiency is @xmath133 thus locally , the spins operate counter to the global temperature gradient present due to @xmath2 . but globally we do have @xmath96 and @xmath134 . thus the function of the two - spin engine is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics , although locally we seem to have a violation of the same . this apparent contradiction is resolved below using the concept of local effective temperatures .",
    "now each spin in the 2-spin system can be assigned a local effective temperature , corresponding to its local thermal state or the reduced density matrix @xcite .",
    "this is true regardless of the state of the total system . particularly , in stages 1 and 3 of the cycle , from eqs .",
    "( [ rho]-[rho_prime ] ) alongwith local hamiltonian , we get the local temperatures as @xmath135}}\\right)^{-1 } ,   \\label{t}\\ ] ] @xmath136}}\\right)^{-1}. \\label{t1}\\ ] ] the important fact is that in the presence of interactions , the local temperatures are different from the corresponding bath temperatures .",
    "thus @xmath137 and @xmath138 if @xmath139 .",
    "further , since the work in our heat cycle is done only locally , the total work by the system can be regarded as equal to the work by two independent spins operating between their effective temperatures .",
    "\\(i ) engine working in @xmath140 : the positive work condition for a single spin is given by @xmath141 since @xmath140 , we get @xmath142 at @xmath68 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 and we have the result of kieu s model @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) engine working in @xmath126 : in this model , the positive work condition is satisfied only when @xmath145 thus in this case @xmath146 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown from the definitions ( [ t ] ) and ( [ t1 ] ) that for both the cases , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "finally , based on local temperatures , the counter - intuitive mechanism which leads in case ( ii ) to @xmath149 and @xmath150 can be justified as follows . for @xmath126 , due to the first adiabatic process , the local temperature _ increases _ from @xmath151 to @xmath152 .",
    "after contact with the cold bath , the local temperature becomes @xmath153 , which due to condition ( [ b ] ) is more than @xmath152 .",
    "thus heat should flow from the cold bath to the spin or @xmath150 .",
    "similar considerations lead to rejection of heat by the spin at the hot bath or @xmath149 .",
    "a model of coupled spins is used as working medium to realise a quantum otto engine .",
    "the conditions for the efficiency to be higher than the non - interacting case are found .",
    "the antiferromagnetic interaction between the spins allows a fraction of the total heat to flow from cold bath to hot bath provided the total heat should flow in in a direction suggested by global temperature gradient .",
    "this mechanism increases the efficiency of the system compared to non - interacting spins case . a tighter upper bound for the efficiency",
    "is found which is lower than the carnot value .",
    "the system can also work as a heat engine even if it undergoes an adiabatic compression ( @xmath126 ) in the second stage of the cycle .",
    "here we have observed an interesting mode of operation using the reduced density matrix whereby each spin absorbs heat from the cold bath and rejects some heat to the hot bath while performing a net work .",
    "this feature is also confirmed from the analysis of local effective temperatures of the spins .",
    "g.t . gratefully acknowledges financial support from indian institute of science education and research mohali .",
    "we consider the case of the engine working in the range @xmath140 . the condition to get a _",
    "higher _ efficiency as compared to uncoupled model is the case ( ii ) discussed in section iiia and is given by @xmath154 from the condition @xmath155 ( eq . ( [ bt ] ) ) , we get @xmath156 then normalisation of the probabilities gives @xmath157 from eqs .",
    "( [ p11 ] ) and ( [ p22 ] ) , we have @xmath158 which simplifies to @xmath159 fig . [ a1 ]",
    "shows three possible ways of arranging the energy levels @xmath160 and @xmath161 relative to the level @xmath162 resulting from the first quantum adiabatic process .",
    "equivalently , eq . ( [ levels1 ] ) is of the form @xmath163 , which may be satisfied in one of the following three ways :            so the only possibility is case ( a ) representing the fact that the energy levels @xmath160 and @xmath162 lie below the level @xmath161 when the coupled engine gives a _ higher _ efficiency than the uncoupled case .",
    "when the inequality ( [ levels1 ] ) holds , we can write @xmath176 since @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath125 , we get @xmath177 where @xmath178 . now the global efficiency defined as @xmath102 , can be written as @xmath179 from the inequalities between the probabilities ( eqs .",
    "( [ p11]),([p44 ] ) and ( [ p22 ] ) ) , it follows that @xmath180 .",
    "therefore , we finally obtain that when the efficiency is higher than the uncoupled case ( or the lower bound is @xmath106 ) , then an upper bound for efficiency is given by @xmath181 when @xmath68 , we have @xmath182 .",
    "a similar kind of proof can be constructed for the case @xmath126 .",
    "interestingly , the same bound as eq .",
    "( [ boundeta ] ) is obtained .",
