    "<S> three ways of fitting the @xmath0 mass spectrum in @xmath1 decays are studied . </S>",

    "<S> . a better fit may be obtained with the decay sequence @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a @xmath7 @xmath8 state peaking at 4.0 gev with a width @xmath9 mev . a third possibility , involving a triangle diagram due to @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 fails to fit the data . </S>",

    "<S> bugg + queen mary , university of london , london e14ns , uk    2.5 mm    there has been considerable interest in the @xmath1 discovered by babar [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it has been confirmed by cleo [ 2 ] , by further observations by babar [ 3,4 ] and cleo [ 5 ] and most recently by belle [ 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> its clear observation in decays to @xmath15 has led to suggestions that it may be related to the @xmath16 hybrids predicted in this general mass range [ 7 - 10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed in the radiative return process , where it is produced through @xmath17 ; it therefore has @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> cleo observe @xmath19 [ 2 ] with a rate consistent with half that of @xmath20 , albeit with just 8 clean events . </S>",
    "<S> this result strongly supports @xmath21 for @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the latest belle data [ 6 ] reveal a curious @xmath2 mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the objective here is to examine ways of fitting this spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> three classes of decay scheme for @xmath1 are investigated .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest hypothesis is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 stands for the s - wave as observed in elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the full curve of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) compares data points with the spectrum predicted from the latest parametrisation [ 11 ] ; a brief subroutine for this parametrisation is available from the author . in making this prediction , </S>",
    "<S> the line - shape of @xmath1 has been folded with the phase space for @xmath24 using the breit - wigner parameters determined by belle .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htp ]    -4.0 cm -4 mm    the predicted peak at @xmath25 mev is too wide , fails to reproduce the low point at 750 mev and does not account for the low mass peak . </S>",
    "<S> a minor detail is that none of the fits reported here reproduce accurately the highest mass point at @xmath26 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this mass is outside the range accessible for belle s central @xmath27 mass , 4295 mev ; it is possible that events in this bin arise from spreading of the high mass @xmath2 peak due to mass resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this bin is therefore omitted from all fits , and the curve is normalised to the 113 events in the remaining 9 bins . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fit has @xmath28 for 9 bins and 8 degrees of freedom .    in elastic scattering , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 amplitude is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is close to linear in @xmath31 , with a zero at the adler point @xmath32 . [ </S>",
    "<S> the convention adopted here is that the @xmath33 is taken as particle 3 , hence @xmath34 is the invariant mass of @xmath2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 phase shift goes through @xmath36 at @xmath37 mev and the intensity of @xmath2 elastic scattering peaks there . </S>",
    "<S> however , the pole in the amplitude lies much lower , at @xmath38 mev , because of the strong @xmath31-dependence of the width . in some production processes , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. @xmath39 [ 12 ] and @xmath40 [ 13 ] , the production amplitude is instead well fitted by the same breit - wigner denominator @xmath41 as eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , but with a constant numerator @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic amplitude seems to give a good fit to processes involving low momentum transfers , e.g. decays @xmath43 [ 14]and @xmath44 [ 11 ] </S>",
    "<S> . the production processes of refs . </S>",
    "<S> [ 12 ] and [ 13 ] involve larger momentum transfers , hence more distant singularities . </S>",
    "<S> the decay @xmath45 is closer to the former case .    </S>",
    "<S> an adequate fit may be obtained using destructive interference between eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) and the @xmath46 pole by altering the numerator @xmath42 to @xmath47 with the same breit - wigner denominator @xmath41 as in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fit is shown by the dashed curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 for 9 bins ( 7 fitted parameters ) . this fit seems somewhat artificial , since the numerator has no obvious explanation ; however , it can not presently be ruled out . making @xmath50 complex does not improve the fit significantly .    </S>",
    "<S> it seems unlikely that @xmath51 is responsible for the peak at 950 mev in fig . 1 , because the @xmath52 is too narrow . </S>",
    "<S> the latest bes data on @xmath53 and @xmath54 [ 15 ] determine the full - width at half maximum of @xmath55 to be @xmath56 mev . </S>",
    "<S> belle do not quote their @xmath2 mass resolution , but do quote the width of @xmath1 as @xmath57 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the mass resolution in both cases should be comparable . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath58 mass distribution can not be fitted by @xmath51 and the @xmath3 pole : the contribution from the @xmath3 pole is too broad if it interferes with only the very narrow @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> cleo observe 2 events for the decay to @xmath59 [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these could arise from the known amplitude for @xmath60 or from a small @xmath61 contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) compares the same fits with the 37 events of cleo [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> although statistics are lower , the peak in data again looks narrower than the full curve ; there is also some tentative indication of a rise at low @xmath2 mass . </S>",
    "<S> cleo correct for background from sidebins around the @xmath33 , but do not correct for possible background under the @xmath1 from other @xmath62 states . </S>",
    "<S> judging from the mass range 4.0 to 4.2 gev , this background could be @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> babar [ 1 ] show a @xmath2 mass spectrum which does not show any rise at low @xmath2 mass . </S>",
    "<S> it has been obtained by summing the @xmath1 signal over the whole mass range and then making a background subtraction . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting signal / background ratio is @xmath64 . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> belle s strategy of selecting events in the mass range 4.2 to 4.4 gev , i.e. 1.5 times the full width , gives a better signal / background ratio for the purpose of viewing the @xmath2 mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> some such weighting of data points near the peak of @xmath1 is desirable .    </S>",
    "<S> let us turn to a second hypothesis : sequential decays of the form @xmath4 , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath27 has @xmath21 , as cleo data suggest , the @xmath6 has @xmath65 and could be a 4-quark state . </S>",
    "<S> two cases need consideration . when the orbital angular momentum @xmath66 in both steps of the sequence is zero , @xmath6 has @xmath67 . if @xmath68 , @xmath6 has @xmath18 , @xmath69 or @xmath70 .    with @xmath71 in both steps , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted @xmath2 mass spectrum is close to the full curve of fig . 1 and hence fails to fit the data . </S>",
    "<S> however , with @xmath72 , a good fit emerges naturally , as shown on fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result depends on simple kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> consider the case @xmath73 , @xmath74 , where numbers label the particles . if @xmath72 in the second step , there is a factor @xmath75 in the amplitude ; here @xmath76 is the angle of @xmath77 in the @xmath78 rest frame with respect to the recoil direction of particle 1 . </S>",
    "<S> for fixed @xmath79 , @xmath34 varies linearly with @xmath80 from one side of the dalitz plot to the other , leading to a zero halfway between left- and right - hand edges of the plot . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of @xmath6 determines the value of @xmath81 at which the zero occurs , via the boundaries of the dalitz plot . </S>",
    "<S> the width of @xmath6 controls the sharpness of the dip in the mass spectrum near 750 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> [ t ]    -40 mm -5 mm    fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) shows the upper half of the dalitz plot for this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> the zero due to the factor @xmath80 is clearly visible . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) shows the fit to cleo data . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted mass and width are almost linearly correlated because of the @xmath82 centrifugal barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the optimum fit has a mass of 4.08 gev with @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 for 2 fitted parameters , seven degrees of freedom . fits poorer in @xmath85 by 1 </S>",
    "<S> are obtained with @xmath86 gev , @xmath87 gev or @xmath88 gev , @xmath89 gev . because of the centrifugal barrier for production , the peak intensity is just below 4 gev for all solutions . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath27 mass at the lower end of the range is most plausible , in order to give a reasonable separation in masses of @xmath27 and @xmath6 .    in detail , the amplitude for production of @xmath90 alone is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the breit - wigner amplitude of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath93 , @xmath94 is the breit - wigner amplitude for @xmath6 , @xmath95 is the @xmath82 centrifugal barrier factor as a function of the momentum of @xmath96 in the rest frame of @xmath27 , and @xmath97 is the centrifugal barrier factor as a function of the momentum of @xmath98 in the rest frame of @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the centrifugal barrier is taken as @xmath99 where @xmath100 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> the centrigual barrier cuts off the intensity near the top of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) needs to be symmetrised between particles 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the usual weighting according to phase space @xmath101 is also applied .    </S>",
    "<S> none of the experimental groups has presented data as a function of @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> even with the current low statistics , structure like that of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) should be clearly visible . </S>",
    "<S> it gives rise to a strong peaking at two corners of the dalitz plot and a peak in the @xmath13 spectrum near 4.0 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the situation could however be confused by interferences between amplitudes of the two forms considered so far . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , interference between @xmath1 and underlying background from @xmath103 and @xmath104 is possible . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , van beveren and rupp have argued against the existence of @xmath1 as a separate resonance [ 16 ] ; they interpret the structure in this mass range as arising from thresholds and interferences in the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath105 and @xmath103 amplitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htp ]    -43 mm -28 mm    a third hypothesis will now be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 lies close to the threshold for @xmath106 , particularly for the resonance mass quoted by belle , 4295 mev . a possible mechanism for production of the @xmath15 system is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . in this so - called triangle diagram , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath107 decays ( via a d - wave ) to @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> this long - lived resonance can de - excite from the spectator @xmath109 producing @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> a simulation of this process gives the dotted curve of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , and fails to fit the belle data . </S>",
    "<S> even if interference with the @xmath111 amplitude is included with a fitted complex coupling constant , nothing resembling the belle mass spectrum can be reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> the essential feature of the process in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 is that the @xmath109 and @xmath107 are produced almost at rest in the @xmath27 rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> the pion from @xmath112 decay has a momentum close to 360 mev / c in the @xmath109 rest frame and hence in the @xmath27 rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> this makes a clear signature for this process .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath2 mass spectrum observed by belle in @xmath1 decays is inconsistent with that expected for a final state @xmath111 unless the numerator of the amplitude gives rise to destructive interference . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest , but speculative , hypothesis is the sequential decay to @xmath33 via an intermediate @xmath18 4-quark state . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility fits the data unaided ; on the other hand , there is no obvious reason why the @xmath1 alone should prefer decays to @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be simple to verify or reject this hypothesis in its simplest form , although interferences with the first mechanism could complicate the situation . </S>"
