    "the doping of a mott insulator is a fundamental problem of condensed matter physics , which has attracted considerable attention in view of its relevance to the physics of cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite in the simplest brinkman - rice  @xcite description , the doped metallic state is a fermi liquid in which quasiparticles are formed with a heavy mass @xmath0 and a reduced weight @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the doping level ) .",
    "this physical picture can indeed be rationalized using the modern theoretical framework of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "@xcite dmft , in its single - site version , is applicable when spatial correlations are weak , which is favored by high dimensionality and strong competing ( e.g. orbital ) fluctuations .    in cuprates",
    "however , which are two - dimensional materials with low orbital degeneracy , it was pointed out long ago by anderson in a seminal paper  @xcite that the antiferromagnetic superexchange ( @xmath3 ) plays a key role , leading to strong short - range correlations associated with singlet formation ( valence bonds ) between nearest - neighbor lattice sites .",
    "slave boson mean - field theories  @xcite as well as projected variational wave - functions ,  @xcite provide simple theoretical frameworks to incorporate this effect , modifying the brinkman - rice picture at small doping @xmath4 and leading in particular to a finite effective mass of quasiparticles @xmath5 .",
    "this is indeed consistent with observations in cuprates , in which only a moderate enhancement of the effective mass is observed .    however , both single - site dmft and simple variational or slave - boson mean - field theories share a common feature , namely that the characteristic energy ( or temperature ) scale below which coherent quasiparticles are formed is uniform along the fermi surface , and of order @xmath6 at small doping levels .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with experimental observations in underdoped cuprates .",
    "indeed , these materials are characterized by a strong differentiation of quasiparticle properties in momentum space , a phenomenon which is key to their unusual normal - state properties . in underdoped cuprates ,",
    "coherent quasiparticle excitations are suppressed in the antinodal regions , around momenta ( @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath8 ) of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , and a pseudogap appears below a characteristic temperature scale ( which decreases as the doping level is increased ) .",
    "instead , reasonably coherent quasiparticles are preserved in the nodal regions around ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the signature of this phenomenon in angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is the formation of fermi ` arcs ' in the underdoped regime , defined as the regions of momentum space where the spectral function is intense at low excitation energy ( see e.g. ref .   for a review ) .",
    "suppression of quasiparticle coherence in the antinodal regions is also apparent from other spectroscopies , such as electronic raman scattering  @xcite ( with the b@xmath10 and b@xmath11 channels associated with antinodes and nodes , respectively ) or quasiparticle interference patterns obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy .",
    "@xcite    momentum - space differentiation and the nodal / antinodal dichotomy is therefore an outstanding challenge for theories of strongly - correlated electrons .",
    "various lines of attack to this problem have been taken . at intermediate and strong coupling , and apart from the extremely low - doping region , correlation lengths are expected to be short ( as also supported by experimental observations ) .",
    "hence , it is appropriate in this regime to take into account short - range correlations within cluster extensions of the dmft framework .",
    "such investigations have been quite successful ( for reviews , see e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "most studies have considered clusters of at least four sites ( a plaquette )  @xcite and numerical efforts have been devoted to increasing the cluster size in order to improve momentum - resolution and to advance toward an understanding of the two - dimensional case .",
    "@xcite    in this article , we follow a different route , looking for a description based on the _ minimal cluster _",
    "able to successfully describe momentum - space differentiation together with mott physics .",
    "@xcite we find that a two - site cluster is sufficient to achieve this goal on a qualitative level , and to a large extent on a quantitative level , when compared to larger cluster calculations .",
    "our approach is based on a division of the bz into two patches , one containing in particular the @xmath12 momentum and the other one in particular the @xmath13 and @xmath14 momenta . a mapping onto a two - impurity anderson model with self - consistent hybridization functions",
    "is made , following a generalization of the dynamical cluster - approximation construction ( very similar results are actually obtained within a cellular - dmft self - consistency condition ) .",
    "the self - energies associated with the ` nodal ' and ` antinodal ' patches are shown to correspond to the bonding ( even ) and antibonding ( odd ) orbitals of the self - consistent impurity model , respectively .",
    "this allows us to construct a ` valence - bond dynamical mean - field theory ' ( vb - dmft )  @xcite of nodal / antinodal differentiation , in which this phenomenon is associated with the distinct properties of the orbitals associated with different regions of momentum space .",
    "one of our central results is that , below a critical value of the doping level @xmath15 , the ` nodal ' ( bonding ) orbital remains metallic while the ` antinodal ' ( antibonding ) orbital displays a pseudogap .",
    "correspondingly , the scattering rate associated with the nodal orbital is suppressed in the pseudogap state , while the antinodal orbital scattering rate increases as the doping level is reduced .",
    "hence , nodal / antinodal differentiation corresponds in this minimal description to an orbital differentiation , a _ momentum - space analogue",
    "_  @xcite of the orbital - selective mott transition which has been extensively discussed recently in the different context of transition - metal oxides with several active orbitals .",
    "@xcite the suppressed coherence of antinodal quasiparticles clearly originates , in our description , from mott physics affecting antinodal regions in a dramatic manner while nodal regions remain comparatively protected .",
    "a definite advantage and important motivation for building a minimal description based on the smallest possible cluster is to advance our qualitative understanding .",
    "since the theory is based on a two - site anderson model , results can be interpreted in terms of valence - bond singlet formation and linked to the well - documented competition between singlet - formation and individual kondo screening .",
    "@xcite the two - impurity kondo ( or anderson ) model is the simplest model which captures this competition .",
    "however our findings show that , in contrast to the two - impurity model with a fixed hybridization to the conduction - electron bath , the additional self - consistency of the bath which is central to dynamical mean - field constructions brings in novel aspects . indeed , the critical point encountered at a finite doping @xmath16 is found only in the lattice model involving self - consistent baths , while it is replaced by a crossover in the non self - consistent two - impurity anderson model .",

    "some technical aspects of our work are discussed more in detail in appendices .",
    "we study the hubbard model on a square lattice , with hopping between nearest - neighbor @xmath17 and next - nearest - neighbor sites @xmath18 .",

    "we restrict ourselves to paramagnetic normal phases .    in this paper , we focus on a two - site dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) .",
    "@xcite for completeness , we recall the dca construction in appendix  [ appendix - dca ] .",
    "the principle of the dca approximation is to cut the brillouin zone into patches and approximate the self - energy as a piecewise constant function on the patches .",
    "the many - body problem can then be solved using an effective self - consistent multiple quantum impurity model . a priori",

    "this self - energy is then identified with the fourier transform of the cluster self - energy of a two - site cluster of anderson impurities embedded in a self - consistent bath .",

    "it has been known for a while that in the high - temperature and high - enough doping regime , single - site dmft is very accurate and cluster corrections are quantitatively small . on the other hand , the validity of cluster extensions of dmft in the underdoped regime , where momentum - space differentiation is strong , is not as universally accepted .",
    "consistency of the results between 2-site calculations and calculations with larger clusters provides support to the validity of cluster approaches .",

    "in this appendix , we review for completeness the basic formalism of dca ,  @xcite and discuss in particular its extension to brillouin - zone patches with equal volume and arbitrary shape .",
    "dca can be seen as an approximation to the luttinger - ward ( lw ) functional of a lattice theory . in the lw functional the conservation of momentum at the vertex of diagrams",
    "is accounted for by the function @xmath262 in single - site dmft momentum conservation at the internal vertices of the diagrams is ignored and @xmath263 .",
    "dca attempts at partially restoring momentum conservation by partitioning the brillouin zone into @xmath264 patches @xmath265 centered around a subgroup of @xmath264 momenta @xmath266 and approximating the momentum conservation with @xmath267 where @xmath268 is the representative vector of the patch containing @xmath269 .",
    "this corresponds to taking into account momentum conservation among the patches and discarding momentum conservation inside the single patch .",
    "the dca lw functional contains the same diagrams as the original lattice functional with all the internal green s functions replaced by the coarse - grained green s functions @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the number of momenta contained in the patch @xmath265 ( the volume of the patch ) . to see this we can consider the simplest graph contributing to the lw functional .",
    "the contribution of this graph to the lattice functional is given by @xmath272 replacing the original momentum conservation with the dca approximation we obtain @xmath273 it is then clear that if the number of @xmath274- points ( the bz volume ) is the same for every patch , the prefactor can be simplified , yielding @xmath275    this functional corresponds to the functional of a problem with @xmath264 momenta and hence can be obtained by the solution of a cluster impurity problem .",
    "the crucial observation is that , as long as the volume is the same for all the patches , the dca functional is the functional of a cluster problem which , once expressed in real space coordinates , retains purely local interactions , precisely identical to those of the original hubbard model .",
    "this ensures that this procedure does not generate additional interactions in the cluster .",
    "however , the _ shape _ of the patches is not constrained in this procedure . a possible route to exploit this freedom is to notice that dca can also be interpreted as an approximation to the lattice self - energy ( see sec .  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "indeed dca corresponds to approximating the self - energy by a constant value in each patch @xmath276 hence using physical intuition patches can be shaped in such a way to enclose regions with definite properties , such as nodal and antinodal regions for example .",
