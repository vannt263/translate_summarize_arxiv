    "genetics is concerned with the physical characteristics of organisms that are passed on from one organism to another through the use of deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) , consisting of a sequence of nucleotides .",
    "the nucleotides are the chemical bases adenosine , thymine , cytosine and guanine that are denoted using the alphabet @xmath0 .",
    "those on one strand are paired in a complementary fashion with those on the other strand , where adenosine matches with thymine , and guanine with cytosine .",
    "groups of three bases are called codons , and these encode the twenty amino acids that combine to form proteins , the building blocks of life . in a nutshell , the central dogma of molecular biology states that `` dna makes rna makes protein '' .",
    "this is encapsulated in figure  [ dogmafigure ] .",
    "the dna is transcribed into complementary messenger ribonucleic acid ( mrna ) . in rnas ,",
    "the alphabet is @xmath1 where uracil plays the same role that thymine does in dna , as it pairs with guanine .",
    "sections of the mrna that do not code for proteins are removed , and a `` poly - a tail''a sequence composed entirely of adenosine bases  is added to ( chemically ) stabilise the sequence .",
    "the mrna then acts as a template for protein synthesis .",
    "transfer rnas ( trnas ) bind to an amino acid on one end , and a complimentary set of three bases on the mrna template . a 1d sequence of amino acids forms and",
    "is then detached from the trnas and folds into a 3d structure .",
    "this sometimes occurs by itself and sometimes with the aid of other proteins , either immediately or at a later date in the life of the cell .",
    "there are several key areas in which mathematical principles underlie , influence , and can provide information about genetic structures .",
    "the key questions that these principles can help answer are    * why do we have four bases , a triplet coding and twenty amino acids ? *",
    "why do we observe the particular assignment of triplets to amino acids that we do ?",
    "* how do new gene sequences arise , and how do they spread in a population ? * how can we analyse the sequences that arise ?    some mathematically - based answers are discussed in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the following is a summary of the work of soto and toh  @xcite , who took a mathematical approach to the question of why four bases , a triplet coding , and 20 amino acids are used , based on the assumption that nature will , over evolutionary time , find a solution to the problem that minimises the amount of cell machinery .",
    "it also assumes that the machinery is not unlike that used by computer memory chips to decode  @xcite .",
    "this is not a bad assumption , but leaves out chemical tricks that that the trnas can use .",
    "i also use the fact that optimal solutions , since they have an advantage in evolutionary terms , spread in a population as i explore later .",
    "the main argument of soto and toh is as follows :    firstly , they define the maximum number of amino acids as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of possible bases ( symbols of length 1 ) and @xmath4 the number of positions . for example",
    ", the amino acid codings used in all living things has @xmath5 bases and @xmath6 positions , a triplet code .",
    "this gives a total of @xmath7 possible amino acids .",
    "for the assumptions above , it turns out the amount of `` hardware '' , or cell machinery , is proportional to the number of bases times the number of positions , which can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are as defined above .",
    "it also turns out that to minimise the amount of hardware , one can write this number of amino acids as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the base of the natural logarithm , and describes many growth and decay processes that occur in the natural world , and @xmath11 is the number of positions .",
    "so we need to have the number of bases close to @xmath12 , thus optimising the number of positions for a given @xmath13 by setting @xmath14 then we can find a semi - optimal @xmath13 by , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the actual number of positions used , resulting in a degeneracy , @xmath17 where @xmath3 is the number of actual bases used and @xmath18 is the minimum ( integer ) possible .",
    "then the actual amount of hardware used is @xmath19 and we write the difference between this amount of hardware , and the optimal , @xmath20 , as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the difference in `` hardware '' between the actual and optimal solution , and this is always greater than zero as we can approach but never achieve the minimal amount of `` hardware '' ( since this would require a non - integral number of bases .",
    "if we set the derivative , or rate of change of @xmath22 , @xmath23 to zero , this allows us to find the optimal solution for the number of amino acids for fixed number of base positions .",
    "a graph of @xmath22 is shown in figure  [ fig : delta ] , showing the minima for one , two and three positions occurring at three , seven , and 20 .",
    "this assumes four bases are used the actual minima , and for the best possible choice of number of bases , are shown in table  [ table : minima ] , again , indicating 20 amino acids is the optimal number .",
    ".this table shows the optimal number of amino acids for 1 - 4 base positions , and the corresponding ( minimal ) difference between the actual coding and the theoretical minimum @xmath20 . [",

    "in this section i will first introduce the topic of entropy , and then discuss how it applies to the introns , the parts of genes that are cut out of the transcribed mrna sequence template before the protein is made .",
    "entropy is also discussed later on , as it can also be used to analyse the mathematical properties of existing sequences .",
    "entropy is a measure of the amount of order or disorder in a sequence , which can be thought of as the information ( ignoring context ) .",
    "the mathematical formula is @xmath24 where @xmath11 denotes different symbols from the set of symbols in a sequence , @xmath25 , and the @xmath26 is the probability of finding a symbol , or simply the number of times it occurs divided by the total number of symbols in the sequence .",
    "for example , the sequence @xmath27 has @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and thus has entropy @xmath30 bits ( the same bits that computers use ) of information .",
    "a related topic to the shannon entropy is chaitin - kolmogorov entropy .",
    "this is the `` algorithmic '' entropy , that is defined in terms of the shortest computer program that could reproduce a given sequence .",
    "this is related to the shannon entropy ( ideally it should approach , or get close to , the measure of the shannon entropy ) .",
    "we can consider the chaitin - kolmogorov entropy as being like a self - extracting zip ( computer ) file : the data is compressed , and a short program is attached which can then decompress the compressed data when the self - extracting file is run .",
    "i show below that this is similar to what occurs in introns      entropy can enlighten us on two key things : evolutionary advantages for introns , and also on patterns found in specific existing genes .",
    "the former is discussed here , and the latter is discussed in the following section .    if we write consider each protein as composed of distinct functional modules ( true for many , but not all proteins ) then we often find other proteins containing the same modules .",
    "if we can write these alternative proteins as a single gene , with alternative splices , then we can increase the shannon entropy , since there is less redundancy ( and thus the probabilities of finding various bases are more even ) .",
    "this also increasess the chaitin - kolomogorov entropy , if we can use this alternative splicing a lot , in comparison to the extra genes we need to encode for this alternative splicing machinery  an `` algorithm '' to unpack the alternative splices from a single gene . in general ,",
    "if the entropy of a system increases , the complexity increases ( not always true since a true random signal has a very low complexity ) , and this leads to increased adaptability ( but trades off reliability ) .    the need to have minimal machinery here again guides us as to the evolutionary solution found .",
    "if we have some systematic way of marking where these modules , or exons , start and stop in genes , then we can use the same set of cellular machinery repeatedly .",
    "this then allows a greater degree of freedom in terms of the instructions that can be coded for , since we can include non-(protein-)coding instructions in these introns . as a very simple example of this",
    ", it has been showing that increasing the intron length can decrease the probability ( or in other words , the final amount of protein ) of containing the exon immediately after that intron .",
    "mathematics not only underpins genetic structures but it can also be used to analyse genetic structures in existing organisms .",
    "the following is an excerpt from my paper on using mutual information to analyse dna sequences .",
    "mutual information is like shannon information above , except for two sequences .",
    "basically it describes the total information covered by two sequences , say @xmath25 and @xmath31 , making sure to not double count the information they have in common .",
    "the mathematical formula is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the shannon entropy defined above in eq .",
    "[ eqn : shannonentropy ]    a mathematical for showing the existence of long - range correlations in dna is to use the mutual information function , as given in eq .",
    "[ mutualinfo ] below .",
    "this approach has been shown to distinguish between coding and non - coding regions  @xcite .",
    "we explore the use of the the mutual information function given in eq .",
    "[ mutualinfo ] : @xmath34 for symbols @xmath35 ( in the case of dna , @xmath36 ) .",
    "@xmath37 is the probability that symbols @xmath38 and @xmath39 are found a distance @xmath40 apart .",
    "this is related to the correlation function in eq .",
    "[ correlation ]  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are numerical representations of symbols @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "as discussed by li  @xcite , the fact that we are working with a finite sequence means that this @xmath44 overestimates the true @xmath45 by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of symbols ( for dna this is always 4 ) and @xmath13 is the sequence length .",
    "an example of applying this method to a real sequence of ( mouse ) dna is shown in figure  [ miplots : real ] , clearly showing the existence of long - range correlations .",
    "it is not altogether clear why these correlations exist across proteins , it may be due to variants of functional modules , stringed together to make a protein , or it may be due to interesting structures in introns .     in eq .",
    "[ mutualinfo ] against base distance @xmath40 for the sequence of the map kinase - activated protein kinase 2 gene from _ mus musculus _ ( in plain english : a mouse protein ) , shown in a darker line style , compared with the set of 100 randomized sequences of the same base distribution , the lighter band .",
    "the graph of mutual information in the map kinase gene mostly sits about the `` noise floor '' of the randomized sequences , in which the correlations have been destroyed , width=453 ]",
    "mathematics presents us with powerful tools , such as entropy , and game theory , that enlighten us as to what sort of genetic structures exist , how they evolve , and how we can analyse them .",
    "in particular , i have shown mathematical arguments for :    * why four bases , a triplet code , and 20 amino acids are use , * why the triplets code for the 20 amino acids ( and start and stop codons ) in the way they do , * why introns are expected to evolve , and how they can be used to give increased flexibility , * how optimal solutions to evolutionary problems spread in a population , and * how to analyse genetic structures .",
