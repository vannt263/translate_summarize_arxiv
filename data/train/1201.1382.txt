    "the gravitational aggregates of ( a few to hundreds of ) galaxy clusters are often called _ the superclusters _ which are marginally bound systems , sources of soft x - ray and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see ) , and have conspicuously filamentary shapes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "although quite rare in the local universe , the superclusters are believed to be quite common phenomena on the scales larger than @xmath0 mpc .",
    "the nearby virgo cluster as well as the local group where our milky way resides also belongs to the local superclusters that contains more than @xmath0 member clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references there in ) .    in a @xmath1cdm ( @xmath1+cold dark matter ) universe",
    ", the formation of the superclusters at the present epoch represents the grand finale of the hierarchical merging events .",
    "no bound objects could form on mass scales larger than that of the present rich superclusters in the future due to the anti - gravitational effect of the cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "that is , the rich superclusters observed at present epoch will end up as isolated massive clusters in the future when the @xmath1 becomes progressively more dominant ( e.g.,see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the dark energy were not @xmath1 or if the large - scale gravity deviates from the general relativity ( gr ) , the superclusters could meet a different fate .",
    "for example , in qcdm ( quintessence+cdm ) models , more massive objects than the rich superclusters would form through the large scale clustering of the quintessence scalar field ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in some modified gravity scenarios where the universe has no anti - gravitational dark energy @xcite",
    ", nothing would prevent the superclusters from assembling into larger scale objects .",
    "henceforth , the number counts of the rich superclusters might be a powerful indicator of any modification to gravity and the true nature of dark energy .",
    "there are two advantages that the number counts of the rich superclusters have as a cosmological probe over that of the clusters .",
    "first of all , the rich superclusters are larger and rarer on average than the clusters , and thus their abundance should be more sensitive to the growth rate and clustering of the large - scale structure .",
    "second , since the superclusters are still in the quasi - linear regime , their mass function may be fully analytically tractable with the lagrangian perturbation theory alone .",
    "it goes without saying that a robust analytic model derived from the first principles is much more desirable than the empirical fitting formula .",
    "it was @xcite who for the first time attempted to analytically derive the supercluster mass function ( i.e. , the number density of the superclusters per unit volume as a function of mass ) , in the framework of the standard press - schechter mass function theory @xcite .",
    "pioneering as it was , their work was based on a few unjustified assumptions , which led their model to fail in matching the n - body results ( m. oguri in private communication ) .",
    "@xcite determined numerically the mass function of the supercluster - like filaments using the data from large n - body simulations and showed that the standard excursion set theory is incapable of reproducing the numerical results .",
    "although they claimed that that when the peak - exclusion effect is incorporated , the excursion set mass function of the superclusters shows a qualitative agreement with the numerical results , their model still fails in making robust quantitative success .",
    "the main difficulty in modeling the supercluster mass function lies in the fact that the superclusters are not relaxed systems but in the middle of triaxial collapsing process . instead of just assuming naively that the superclusters correspond to those less overdense sites in the linear density field than the clusters",
    ", the dynamical state of the on - going triaxial collapse process has to be taken into account for the evaluation of the supercluster mass function .",
    "here our aim is to develop a robust analytical model for the supercluster mass function that would match the results from the largest - scale n - body simulations . to accomplish this aim ,",
    "the modification of the excursion set mass function formalism is made in the direction of incorporating the triaxial clustering conditions for the formation of the superclusters with the help of the first order lagrangian theory .",
    "this paper is organized into four sections whose contents are summarized as follows : in  [ sec : analytic ] we present an analytic model for the supercluster mass function through modifying the excursion set formalism . in  [ sec : numerical ] we test the analytic model against the numerical results obtained utilizing the publicly available data from various n - body simulations . in  [ sec : rich ] we explore the possibility of using the relative abundance of the rich superclusters as a cosmological test of gravity . in  [ sec : con ] the prospects of our work are discussed and the bottom line is stated .",
    "the standard excursion set mass function theory has two key concepts : the random - walks and the absorbing barrier @xcite .",
    "the growth of the linearly extrapolated density contrast , @xmath2 , in a given lagrangian region , @xmath3 , is described as diffusive random walking process as a function of the _",
    "time_-like variable , @xmath4 , that monotonically increases as the random walking proceeds . here",
    ", @xmath5 is a smoothed density field , @xmath6 is a mean mass density of the universe , and @xmath4 is the rms fluctuation of the linear density , defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the power spectrum of @xmath9 that depends on the key cosmological parameters , and @xmath10 is the filter ( in fourier space ) with which @xmath9 is smoothed on the mass scale of @xmath11 . throughout this paper",
    ", we choose the top - hat spherical window function for @xmath10 and utilize the publicly available camb code @xcite to compute @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "when a random walk hits a prescribed absorbing barrier with height of @xmath12 at @xmath4 , it corresponds to the occurrence of the gravitational collapse to form a bound object of mass @xmath11 . by saying an _ absorbing barrier _",
    ", it means that the barrier represents the lower limit of @xmath13 : once the value of @xmath13 exceeds the lower limit , @xmath14 , the barrier absorbs the density growth , bringing its random walking to a halt .",
    "the barrier height ( i.e. , the density threshold ) , @xmath12 , is determined by the underlying dynamics of the gravitational collapse .",
    "it has a constant value of @xmath15 in the spherical collapse model @xcite , while it depends on @xmath4 in the ellipsoidal collapse models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "implicitly _ the random walking process of @xmath13 . for mathematical convenience , we prefer using jedamzik s formalism , i.e. , the implicit version of the diffusion equation , for the evaluation of @xmath16 .",
    "the excursion set mass function derived as a solution to equation ( [ eqn : jedam1 ] ) automatically satisfies the normalization condition of @xmath26 , properly taking into account the occurrences of the clouds - in - clouds ( underdense regions embedded in overdense regions ) , which in fact is reflected by the conditional probability , @xmath23 .",
    "the functional form of @xmath23 depends on which window function is used : it has a constant value for the case of the sharp-@xmath27 space filter , while it varies with the mass scale for the cases of more realistic top - hat spherical and gaussian filters @xcite .    very recently , @xcite have generalized the standard excursion set formalism by incorporating both of the non - markovian nature of the random walks and the stochastic nature of the absorbing barrier to account for the complexities associated with the actual formation and practical identification of the bound objects . here",
    ", the non - markovian random walking process corresponds to the case in which all the random steps in the trajectory are mutually correlated . technically speaking",
    ", the non - markovian random walking process depicts the growth of the density field smoothed with either the top - hat spherical or the gaussian filter @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the growth of the density field smoothed by the sharp-@xmath27 space filter ( i.e. , the top - hat filter in the fourier space ) corresponds to a markovian random walking process where only the adjacent walks are mutually correlated .",
    "this generalized excursion set mass function formalism proposed by @xcite was greatly successful not only in reproducing the n - body results but also in explaining physically the scale dependence of the barrier heights in the ellipsoidal collapse models ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . unfortunately , however , this generalized formalism with the stochastic barrier is not directly applicable to the supercluster mass function for the following reasons .",
    "first of all , this generalized excursion set formalism resorts to the numerically derived probability density distributions of @xmath12 from the n - body simulations of @xcite to specify the stochastic scatter of the absorbing barrier .",
    "the results of the numerical work of @xcite , however , is valid only for the cases of _ bound _ objects like clusters but not for the case of marginally bound systems like superclusters .",
    "furthermore the stochastic absorbing barrier model is incapable of capturing the essential feature of the anisotropic formation of the real superclusters . in this generalized formalism @xcite",
    ", it is assumed that the more massive an object is , the more closely its collapse process follows the spherical dynamics ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in consequence , the stochastic barrier height @xmath12 has the smallest standard deviation around the spherical average value of @xmath28 in the high - mass limit",
    "however , the superclusters observed in the real universe have quite non - spherical elongated shapes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , recent high - resolution n - body simulations have revealed that the merging of the clusters into the superclusters occur preferentially along the cosmic filaments in an anisotropic way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in other words",
    ", the marginally bound superclusters do not follow the spherical collapse dynamics unlike the bound massive clusters .    in the following subsections , introducing a new concept of _ multi - dimensional clustering _",
    "barrier to account for the anisotropic formation of the superclusters , we modify the excursion set formalism to evaluate the supercluster mass function in a fully analytical manner",
    ".      the zeldovich approximation @xcite , as the first order lagrangian perturbation theory , relates the evolved mass density @xmath29 at a given eulerian region , @xmath3 , to the initial shear eigenvalues , @xmath30 ( in a decreasing order ) , as @xmath31 = \\bar{\\rho}\\pi_{i=1}^{3 } [ 1-\\lambda_{i}({\\bf q})]^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 are the three eigenvalues of the the initial tidal shear ( i.e.,linear deformation ) tensor defined as the second derivative of the perturbation potential smoothed on a given mass scale at the corresponding lagrangian region , @xmath32 .",

    "this zeldovich model provides the simplest and the most intuitive explanation for the formation of the cosmic web in the universe .",

    "the gravitational collapse occurs along the directions of the eigenvectors ( i.e. , the principal axes of the linear deformation tensors ) corresponding to the positive eigenvalues .",
    "the densest lagrangian regions with three positive eigenvalues ( @xmath38 ) would condense out clumpy objects like clusters in the knobs of the cosmic web after collapsing along the three principal axes .",
    "the zeldovich approximation can not be used to model the formation of the bound clusters due to its notorious failure after the first shell - crossing corresponding to the moment of @xmath39 @xcite , but it may be still adequately valid to depict the formation of the marginally bound superclusters .",
    "we assume that a supercluster of mass @xmath11 forms in a lagrangian region @xmath40 where the following three conditions are satisfied : + i. the three shear eigenvalues are all positive : @xmath41 .",
    "the largest shear eigenvalue does not exceed unity : @xmath42 .",
    "the second to the largest shear eigenvalue exceeds one - half : @xmath43 .",
    "+ the first condition guarantees that a supercluster is not some section of a sheet or of a filament but a three dimensional marginally bound object that are still under triaxial collapsing process .",
    "the second condition assures that the gravitational collapse along the major principal axis ( the eigenvector corresponding to the second to the largest eigenvalue ) has yet to be completed and thus the formation of a supercluster corresponds to an on - going merging event before the occurrence of the first shell - crossing .",
    "the third condition is derived not from the dynamical consideration of the superclusters but from the consideration of their geometrical shapes . @xcite",
    "have shown that the prolateness , @xmath44 , of a proto - halo region defined as @xmath45 is most likely to have zero value on average .",
    "since the superclusters correspond to proto - halo regions , expected to end up as bound halos in the future , their prolateness should be most likely to be zero , too . given that when the formation of a supercluster occurs when @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the mostly likely zero value of the prolateness implies @xmath48 .",
    "now , let us translate the above three conditions for the supercluster formation into the excursion set jargons .",
    "the growth of the three shear eigenvalues is now described as multi - dimensional random walking process as a function of the monotonically increasing variable of @xmath4 .",
    "a supercluster of mass @xmath11 forms when the multi - dimensional random walk enters _ a clustering zone _ surrounded by two flat absorbing barriers ( @xmath48 and @xmath47 ) and one flat reflecting barrier ( @xmath46 ) . here",

    "the mass - limited cluster sample from the mice simulation contains less number of the low - mass clusters ( i.e. , the group - size clusters ) than those from the other two simulations and thus it has a larger value of the mean cluster separation , @xmath82 .",

    "as mentioned in  [ sec : intro ] , given that the abundance of the rich superclusters in the universe reflects how fast the structures grow and how frequently the clusters merge on the largest scale of the universe , it may be possible in principle to use the relative abundance of the rich superclusters as a cosmological test of dark energy and gravity . to explore this possibility",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this toy mg model is distinguishable from the fiducial model ( gr+@xmath1cdm ) only in the value of @xmath123 since the former has @xmath124 while in the latter it is approximately @xmath125 . assuming that our analytic model for the supercluster mass function also works in this toy mg model",
    ", we evaluate @xmath108 , which is plotted in figure [ fig : rsc_g ] ( dashed line ) . the fiducial ( gr+@xmath1cdm with wmap7 parameters ) case",
    "is also plotted with the jackknife errors for comparison ( solid lines ) at @xmath126 and @xmath116 in the left and right panel , respectively .",
    "the jackknife errors @xmath126 and @xmath116 are obtained from the codecs and mice simulations , respectively .",
    "the difference in @xmath108 between the two models at @xmath121 reaches up to @xmath127 and @xmath128 at @xmath126 and @xmath129 , respectively , which proves clearly that the relative abundance of the rich superclusters at a given epoch is useful in principle as a cosmological test of gravity .",
    "we have developed a fully analytic model for the supercluster mass function by extending the excursion set formalism to the case of marginally bound systems under triaxial collapsing process .",
    "the analytically derived supercluster mass function has been found to agree impressively well with three different n - body results at various redshifts , revealing its robustness . using our model ,",
    "we have shown that the relative abundance of the rich superclusters at a given epoch is sensitive to modification of gravity as well as to dark energy equation of state .",
    "we expect a wide application of the supercluster mass function in various fields",
    ". the abundance of the rich superclusters may be useful in constraining primordial non - gaussianity parameter as well as neutrino mass due to its sensitivity to the initial cosmological conditions . as mentioned in @xcite",
    ", we also expect it to be useful in estimating the statistical significance of the amount of the warm hot intergalactic media in the superclusters which are the sources of soft x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite .",
    "our analytic model may also allow us to analytically evaluate the late - time integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect of superclusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    before applying our analytic model to the real universe , however",
    ", we will have to undertake a couple of follow - up tasks .",
    "the first task is to investigate whether or not our model is valid for non - standard cosmologies . given that our model is fully analytically derived from first principles , we have expected naturally it to work in qcdm or in models with modified gravity . however",
    ", this assumption has to be verified quantitatively using n - body tests .",
    "for instance , the zeldovich approximation in non - standard cosmologies might be different from equation ( [ eqn : zel ] ) , which could lead to different conditions for the formation of the superclusters .",
    "the second task is to account for the projection effect along the directions of the line - of - sight on the mass measurement of the superclusters .",
    "since most of the superclusters have elongated shapes along the cosmic filaments , it would be harder to find the member clusters due to the projection effect if a supercluster happens to be elongated along the direction of the line - of - sight .",
    "we plan to conduct these two follow - up works and to report the results elsewhere in the future .",
    "we acknowledge the use of data from the millennium , codecs and mice simulations that are publicly available at http://www.millennium.com , + http://www.marcobaldi.it/web/codecs.html , and http://www.ice.cat/mice , respectively . the millennium simulation analyzed in this paper",
    "was carried out by the virgo supercomputing consortium at the computing center of the max - planck society in garching , germany .",
    "we also acknowledges the financial support from the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) grant funded by the korea government ( mest , no.2011 - 0007819 ) and from the national research foundation of korea to the center for galaxy evolution research .",
