    "x - ray novae ( xn ) are compact binary systems in which a roche - lobe - overflowing main sequence or subgiant star , typically @xmath3 , transfers matter onto a black hole ( bh ) or neutron star ( ns ) primary ( for a review , see van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ; tanaka & lewin 1995 ; tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",
    "xn are highly variable and undergo rare but dramatic x - ray and optical outbursts . for most of the time , xn are in a quiescent state and are very faint . during quiescence",
    ", the mass accretion rate from the disk to the compact object may be very small , producing a low level ( perhaps no ) x - ray emission .",
    "x - ray observations of quiescent xn have been hindered due to the limited sensitivity of previous x - ray telescopes .",
    "nonetheless , several of the brightest black hole x - ray novae ( bhxn ) have been detected with _",
    "rosat _ , _ asca _  and _",
    "bepposax_. this quiescent x - ray ( and associated non - stellar optical ) emission is difficult to explain using standard accretion disk models .",
    "narayan , mcclintock , & yi ( 1996 ) , narayan , barret , & mcclintock ( 1997a ) and narayan , garcia , & mcclintock ( 2001 ) showed that the observations can be explained by an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model .",
    "an adaf is an accretion flow in which most of the energy is stored in the accreting gas rather than being radiated away promptly , as in a thin accretion disk .",
    "this thermal energy is advected with the flow to the center  hence the name adaf .",
    "if the accretor is a bh , the gas with all its thermal energy will be lost from view as it falls through the event horizon .",
    "however , in the case of a ns , the accretion energy will eventually be radiated from the star s surface .",
    "this difference can explain the fact that quiescent bhs are much fainter than quiescent nss .",
    "using pre-_chandra _  data , narayan , garcia , & mcclintock ( 1997b ) showed that bhs display a large variation of luminosity between their bright and their faint states , while nss have a much smaller variation .",
    "menou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) subsequently pointed out that in comparing the luminosities of bh and ns systems , it is important to compare systems with comparable orbital periods .",
    "more recently , garcia et al . ( 2001 ; hereafter g01 ) presented a comprehensive study of a series of _ chandra _  observations of bhxn in quiescence ; they confirmed that the quiescent x - ray luminosities of bhxn are @xmath4 lower than those of neutron star x - ray novae ( nsxn ) .",
    "such findings provide strong evidence that bhs have event horizons .",
    "recently , bildsten & rutledge ( 2000 ) suggested that the rapidly rotating secondaries of bhxn may generate stellar coronae with sufficient x - ray luminosity to account for the observed quiescent luminosities of many of these systems .",
    "based on an analogy to the ` saturated ' coronae in the most luminous rs  cvn stars , the coronae in quiescent bhxn are predicted to have maximum luminosities of 0.1% of the stellar bolometric luminosity , and x - ray spectra that are typical of moderately hot ( @xmath5 1  kev ) , optically thin thermal plasmas . while the x - ray luminosity of v404cyg is too high to be produced by a stellar corona ,",
    "previous observations with modest sensitivity have indicated that the luminosities of other bhxn are consistent with a saturated corona ( bildsten & rutledge 2000 ) . for these systems ,",
    "the high s / n x - ray spectra attainable with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ can provide a critical test of the possible coronal origin of the quiescent x - ray luminosity ( bildsten & rutledge 2000 ; lasota 2001 ) .    in this paper , we report the detailed analysis of _ chandra _ spectra of the brightest three quiescent bhxn observed under an ao-1 gto program ( v404cyg , a062000  and groj165540 ) .",
    "we also reanalyzed the spectrum of a fourth bhxn ( xtej1550564 ) observed under a ddt proposal .",
    "we note that three other bhxn ( groj0422 + 32 , gs2000 + 25 and 4u154347 ) observed under our ao-1 gto and go programs provided insufficient counts for spectral analysis .",

    "we chose to bin the data in order to achieve enough counts per bin to employ the @xmath29 statistic .",
    "however , binning the data heavily can result in a loss of spectral information .",
    "one can also apply the gehrels approximation ( gehrels 1986 ) to permit the use of fewer counts ( @xmath45 ) per bin , but this approach over - estimates the errors .",

    "we find herein that the x - ray spectra of v404 cyg , a0620 - 00 , gro j165540 and xtej1550564  are harder ( equivalently hotter ) than typical spectra of stellar coronae .",
    "the average temperature for these sources as determined from the @xmath35 free ( fixed ) fits to raymond - smith models is 7.4  kev ( 10.1  kev ) .",

    "thus the combination of spectral and luminosity information argue against a coronal source for the quiescent luminosity in 5 out of the 6 cases for which the coronal mechanism is potentially relevant ( i.e. excluding 4u  1543 - 47 ) . only in the case of gs  2000 + 25",
    ", where we are unable to determine a spectrum due to the very low number of counts , is it possible that coronal emission from the secondary dominates the quiescent luminosity .    during strong flares , stellar coronae",
    "are occasionally seen at temperatures higher than the 1.4  kev average value quoted above .",
    "for example , a `` super - hot giant flare '' from algol was seen to have a peak temperature of 12.37  kev ( favata & schmitt 1999 ) . in this regard , it is important to note that both a0620 - 00 and groj165540  were observed with _",

    "therefore it is unlikely that these two systems were in a flaring state during our observations .",
    "either the secondaries in bhxn have coronae unlike those seen before , or the source of the quiescent luminosity is not coronal .",
    "this is not to say that these secondaries do not have x - ray emitting corona , but merely that the luminosity from such a corona is swamped by the accretion luminosity even during quiescence .",
    "an obvious point to note is the following .",
    "emission from a stellar corona will contribute at some level to the quiescent x - ray luminosity .",
    "if in a few cases this level is significant , then the accretion luminosities of the black holes must be even lower than our estimates and the argument for event horizons would be further strengthened .",
    "it is worth noting that the five bhxn for which coronal emission is ruled out cover the full range of orbital period and stellar bolometric flux .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that there is some particular region of parameter space where the coronal model applies . in comparison ,",
    "the adaf model is consistent with all the observations , covering the full parameter space ( narayan et al .",
    "1996 , 1997a , 2001 ; lasota 2000 ) .",
    "results of this paper further constrain the required adaf model .",
    "quataert & narayan ( 1999 ) proposed that significant mass can be lost to an outflow / wind in adaf models .",
    "they also predicted the spectral shape for adaf models with and without winds for v404cyg .",
    "our observations indicate that the power - law photon indices of v404cyg , a062000 , groj165540  and xtej1550564  are consistent with @xmath111 . therefore ,",
    "models in which comptonization dominates are favored ( narayan et al .",
    "1997a ) ; strong - wind models become unlikely unless @xmath112 ( the fraction of the turbulent energy which heats the electrons ) is large enough ( quataert & narayan 1999 ) .",
    "adaf models also predict line emission in x - ray spectra ( e.g. narayan & raymond 1999 ) .",
    "we set an upper limit on the equivalent width of any line feature between 6.47 kev for v404cyg  and it is much higher than the theoretical prediction even for model with winds",
    ". a larger collecting area instrument like _ xmm - newton _  is needed to study this kind of feature .",
    "recent _ rxte _ and _ chandra _  observations of xtej1550564  also suggest that the adaf model can explain the quiescent x - ray emission , although it does not explain all the behavior observed at other wavelengths ( tomsick et al .",
    "the similarity of the quiescent spectra of v404cyg , xtej1550564 , groj165540 , and a0620 - 00 found herein suggests that they may all be described by a similar adaf model .",
    "detailed broadband spectral modeling of these systems should be considered in order to further constrain the models .",
    "the sources discussed in this paper have a wide range of luminosities .",
    "v404cyg  is the brightest quiescent bhxn in our sample , with a 0.37 kev luminosity of @xmath113 . in our _ chandra",
    "_  observations the source was somewhat more luminous than in previous quiescent observations in which the luminosity was about @xmath114  ( see table 1 ) .",
    "wagner et al . (",
    "1994 ) reported that v404cyg  exhibited a decrease in intensity by a factor of 10 in @xmath11 0.5 day , while our _ chandra _  observations showed a factor of 2 variability in a few ksec .",
    "wagner et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also found that there may have been a factor @xmath42 2 variability on timescales of @xmath13 minutes in the highest intensity bins for the _ rosat _  observations .",
    "thus v404cygin quiescence shows variability in x - rays on both short - term ( a few ksec ) and long - term ( years ) timescales .",
    "significant x - ray variability in quiescence was also seen in 4u163047 ( parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) , a062000  ( asai et al . 1998 ; menou et al .",
    "1999 ; also table 1 ) and gx3394 ( kong et al . 2000 ) .",
    "v404cyg  and gx339 - 4 are similar in some respects : for example , their quiescent x - ray luminosities are comparable ( kong et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) and gx3394 has also been observed to undergo x - ray variability by a factor of 3 during its quiescent or ` off ' state ( kong et al .",
    "thus , variability in the quiescent state is common , which suggests that bhxn in quiescence are not totally turned off .",
    "we note that xtej1550564 also varied in luminosity by factor of @xmath12 during the two _ chandra _  observations in quiescence ( tomsick et al .",
    "2001 ) ; only v404cyg  and gx3394 have a quiescent luminosity higher than xtej1550564 .    in figure 6",
    ", we plot the eddington - scaled luminosities ( based on the best - fit power - law model ) as a function of orbital period @xmath115 ; this is an update of the same plot from g01 . for the mass of xtej1550564 we assumed @xmath116 ( orosz et al .",
    "2001 ) ; the distance to xtej1550564is estimated to be 2.56.3 kpc ( e.g. s@xmath67nchez - fern@xmath67ndez et al . 1999 ; orosz et al . 2001 ) and we have adopted an average distance of 4 kpc .",
    "we note that for the three long orbital period systems ( v404cyg : 6.47 d , groj165540 : 2.6 d and xtej1550564 : 1.55 d ) , the quiescent luminosity is higher than for the other systems ( figure 6 ) .",
    "this implies that the accretion rate in these systems is higher than for the others according to the adaf model ( narayan et al .",
    "1997a ; menou et al .",
    "it is not clear if there is a positive correlation between the luminosities and orbital periods ( see figure 6 ) ; a larger sample of long orbital period systems is required to study this correlation .    in summary",
    ", we note that our results confirm the prediction of lasota ( 2000 ) , who previously pointed out that x - ray emission from a quiescent bhxn is unlikely to come from a stellar coronae ; instead he argues that the emission is due to an adaf .",
    "based on this model , lasota ( 2000 ) predicted fluxes similar to those reported herein .",
    "moreover , he pointed out that detection of groj0422 + 32 by _",
    "chandra_would rule out the coronal model , and such a detection has been made ( g01 ) .",
    "however , our _ chandra _  spectra are able to rule out only a few of the simple , one - component spectral models we fit to the data . with its larger collection area , observations with _ xmm - newton",
    "_  should be able to do a significantly better job of constraining the source spectra .",
    "additionally , we note that v404  cyg is variable on a few ksec timescale , so simultaneous optical and x - ray observations may shed substantial light on the quiescent accretion processes in this source .",
