    "in recent two decades the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method has been becoming a powerful tool for simulating complex systems @xcite . unlike traditional computational fluid dynamics methods , the fundamental idea of lb method is to construct simplified kinetic models that incorporate the essential physics of microscopic or mesoscopic processes . in the continuum limit",
    "the lb results should obey the macroscopic equation such as euler equation and navier - stokes equation .",
    "because of its intrinsic kinetic nature , the lb model can be used to investigate many physical phenomenon at microscopic or mesoscopic level which are generally difficult for traditional methods .",
    "it has been successfully used to study various complex fluids such as magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , flows of suspensions @xcite , flows through porous media @xcite , compressible fluid dynamics @xcite , multiphase flows @xcite , etc .",
    "it should be pointed out that most of these studies are focused on isothermal and incompressible systems . given the importance of shock wave and detonation in science and engineering ,",
    "lb simulation of high speed compressible fluids were attempted from the early days of lb research .",
    "but most of current lb models for compressible flows are still subject to the constraint of low mach number .",
    "recently , high speed compressible lb model is constructed from the following few aspects @xcite .",
    "( i ) consider appropriate additional viscosity for the situation where the system is far from equilibrium , for example , for systems with shocks @xcite .",
    "( ii ) construct multiple - relaxation - time ( mrt ) lb model @xcite .",
    "( iii ) establish entropic lb model @xcite .",
    "( iv ) introduce the fix - up @xcite and/or flux - limiter schemes @xcite . in this work our lb model for high speed compressible flows belongs to the first category .",
    "detonation @xcite is the supersonic combustion that usually propagates through shock wave .",
    "it is different from deflagration which is the subsonic combustion usually propagating via thermal conductivity .",
    "the detonation phenomena are highly concerned issues in science and engineering .",
    "they are widely used in the acceleration of various projectiles , mining technologies , depositing of coating to a surface or cleaning of equipment , etc . however ,",
    "unintentional detonation phenomenon , when deflagration is desired , is a problem in some devices .",
    "the detonation phenomenon was first recognized by berthelot et al @xcite and mallard et al @xcite during experiments of flame propagation .",
    "the chapmann - jouguet ( cj ) theory @xcite at alternation of the 20 century considers that the detonation front can be treated as a strong discontinuity plane with chemical reaction and that the chemical reaction immediately completes within the infinite thin region .",
    "the zeldovich - von neumann - doering ( znd ) model @xcite presented in 1940s treats detonation front as a shock wave in which no chemical reaction occurs . in this model",
    "the chemical reaction is triggered by shock wave and proceeds at a finite rate to completion thereafter .",
    "numerical simulations for combustion and detonation have been significantly improved in recent 30 years along with the development in both computational methods and available computer facilities@xcite .",
    "there are still two main challenges in simulating such processes .",
    "the first is how to describe wave front .",
    "traditional methods include the eulerian cell scheme @xcite , arbitrary - lagrangian - eulerian(ale ) algorithm @xcite , level set method @xcite , volume of fluid(vof ) method @xcite , front tracking method @xcite , etc .",
    "though the traditional methods can treat contact discontinuity surface , they are not capable of describing the detonation wave faithfully .",
    "the second is how to simulate the chemical reaction and energy releasing processes which are coupled with the flow behavior .",
    "several chemical reaction models @xcite , such as the arrhenius kinetics , cochran s rate function , forest fire burn , two - step model , lee - tarver model , etc , have been introduced . during the energy releasing procedure",
    ", the state of system is generally far from equilibrium .",
    "however , the traditional description based on computational fluid dynamics considers only the cases where the systems can be described by the continuum euler or navier - stokes equations . as a special discretization of the basic equation of non - equilibrium statistical physics , the boltzmann equation ,",
    "the lb model is intrinsically suitable for handling the non - equilibrium effects of the problems mentioned above .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the earliest work of lb modeling combustion phenomena was finished by succi , et al @xcite .",
    "they simulated the methane - air laminar flame under the assumptions of fast chemistry and cold flames with weak heat release .",
    "in 2000 , filippova et al @xcite proposed a hybrid scheme where the flow field is solved by lb method , while the transport equation , energy equation and components equation are solved by the finite difference method .",
    "as a incomplete lb scheme , the hybrid scheme does not apply fully the advantage of lb method .",
    "later , yamamoto et al @xcite employed a pure lb scheme for combustion simulation .",
    "the scheme uses double distribution functions .",
    "one is employed to describe the density and velocity fields , the other describes temperature field .",
    "lee et al @xcite proposed a quasi - incompressible model for the laminar jet diffusion flame .",
    "all those lb models mentioned above are for nearly incompressible systems which are not appropriate for detonation phenomena .",
    "in addition to incompressibility , they assumed that the chemical reaction does not affect the flow fields , which is a lethal flaw for simulating detonation and most of combustion problems .    in this paper , a novel model for combustion and detonation is proposed .",
    "it couples the finite - difference ( fd ) lb model by gan , xu , zhang et al @xcite for fluid with the lee - tarver @xcite model for chemical reaction .",
    "the lee - tarver reaction rate function is composed of two terms , the first is generally referred to as the hot spot formation term and the second is generally referred to the reaction growth term .",
    "the former is used to investigate various spot formation processes and their subsequent growth .",
    "the latter describes the growth of the reaction .",
    "the lee - tarver reaction model is one of the most physically justifiable models which have produced satisfying simulations of the experimental results .",
    "the rest part of the paper is organized as below . in section",
    "ii we introduce the fdlb model for combustion and detonation . in section iii",
    "we validate the new model by simulating various detonation problems . in section iv , we define explicitly some quantities to measure the deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium from various aspects and use the new lb model to study the non - equilibrium effects in the steady detonation procedure . conclusions and discussions are given in section v.",
    "in this section we construct a hybrid lb model for simulating the combustion and detonation phenomena .",
    "such a model should be capable of describing the high speed compressible flow influenced by the chemical reaction .",
    "for the first step , it is assumed that there are only two species present , the reactant and the product , and the reactant is converted to the product by a one step irreversible chemical reaction governed chemical kinetics equation .",
    "the flow field is described by a fdlb model .      for modeling the flow behavior in the combustion and detonation process",
    ", we employ the lattice bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) model improved by gan , xu , zhang , et al @xcite for the density , momentum and energy .",
    "the model is composed of three components : the discrete velocity model , modified lax - wendroff finite difference scheme and additional viscosity term .",
    "the discrete velocity model has the following 33 discrete velocities    [ dvm ]    * v*_0=0 , + * v*_ki = v_k , ,  i=1,2  8    where subscript @xmath1 and @xmath2 indicate the @xmath1-th group , the @xmath2-th direction of the particle velocities , respectively . for the compressible fluid",

    ", the lax - wendroff scheme improves the numerical stability .",
    "the fourth line of equation is the additional viscosity which makes the scheme suitable for both the low and high speed fluid flows .",
    "the fdlb scheme gives consistent results with the naiver - stokes equations in the continuum limit .",
    "the traditional numerical simulation for combustion and detonation is to solve the governing equations which couple the hydrodynamic equations with the chemical kinetic equation . in most of traditional studies ,",
    "the effects of transportation due to viscosity and heat conduction are not explicitly taken into account , so what used are the simple euler equations .",
    "currently , the combustion and detonation behaviors with viscosity and heat conduction still need to be carefully investigated .",

    "in this section , we study several typical one- and two - dimensional detonation problems using the present model : the piston problem including effects of viscosity and heat conduction which is a typical test in studies on shock initiation of explosive ; collision between detonation and shock waves ; regular and mach reflection of plane detonation wave ; richtmyer - meshkov instability caused by detonation wave .      consider a detonation wave in rigid tube , followed by a piston controlled by external forces so that its velocity may be specified .",
    "three cases are considered : ( i ) @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the velocity of piston , @xmath56 is velocity of cj point .",
    "this case has a very simple solution : a uniform state between the front and the piston , since the flow is subsonic , a rarefaction generated at the piston will overtake the front and eventually produce the uniform steady solution corresponding to the new piston velocity ; ( ii ) @xmath57 . we still obtain a uniform state , the cj state . as the flow is sonic ,",
    "the rarefaction generated at the piston can not overtake the detonation wave front ; ( iii ) @xmath58 .",
    "the front can move no slower than velocity of detonation @xmath59 , so we still have the cj state at the front , but the rarefaction wave reduces the velocity behind the front gradually to that of the piston .",
