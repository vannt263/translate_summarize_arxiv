    "the remarkable conjectured ` holographic ' correspondence @xcite due originally to maldacena @xcite , between certain superstring theories in the bulk of anti de sitter space ( ads ) ( in suitable dimensions and times suitable - dimensional spheres and certain other compact spaces @xmath0[note : adscft]@xmath1 ) , entitled ` notes ' . ] and certain supersymmetric conformal field theories ( cft ) on the ads conformal boundary has inspired some authors to study simpler , but more general , types of correspondence between quantum theories defined on a ( fixed ) ads background and associated ( again , conformal ) quantum theories on the ads conformal boundary . in particular , in rehren s ` algebraic holography ' @xcite a geometrically natural bijection between bulk wedges and boundary double - cones is seen to induce a bijection between nets of local * -algebras in the bulk and corresponding nets of local * -algebras on the conformal boundary @xmath0[note : vnvscstar]@xmath1 which bijects between bulk sub*-algebras for wedges and boundary sub*-algebras for double cones , in such a way that the action of the ads isometry group on the bulk algebra goes over to the action of the conformal group on the boundary algebra .",
    "the nets of local * -algebras involved in this correspondence are of the sort introduced earlier @xcite by haag and others in order to give a general mathematical formulation of quantum field theory ( on a fixed background ) ; the main axioms being those of isotony ( i.e.  that the * -algebra for a subregion of a given region is a sub*-algebra of the * -algebra for the region ) and commutativity at spacelike separation . and , indeed",
    ", it is clear that the rehren correspondence amounts , at least in some known simple examples involving bulk ` ordinary ' linear field theories , to a correspondence between theories which , in both bulk and boundary , are quantum field theories . in particular , for a bulk theory consisting of the ( real ) covariant klein - gordon field of mass @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 on ads @xmath0[note : wrap]@xmath1 of any spacetime dimension 1+@xmath4 satisfying vanishing boundary conditions at the @xmath4-dimensional conformal boundary , kay and larkin @xcite have made use of a classical counterpart to holography , which they introduced and called ` pre - holography ' , to obtain by second quantization ( for integer or half - integer @xmath5 in equation ( [ delta ] ) below ) concrete examples of rehren s algebraic holography in which the bulk net of local * -algebras is the usual ( c@xmath6 ) algebra for the klein gordon theory and the boundary net of local * -algebras is a certain subalgebra @xmath0[note : thinloc]@xmath1 of the algebra of a real scalar conformal generalized free field theory @xcite on its conformal boundary with anomalous scaling dimension @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is related to the mass , @xmath2 , of the bulk field and the bulk spatial dimension ( @xmath7 boundary spacetime dimension ) @xmath4 , by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ads radius ( see equations ( [ e : a12 ] ) and ( [ e:104 ] ) ) .",
    "( i.e.  the algebra on the boundary is determined by having a commutator function equal to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is as in equation ( [ wanom ] ) below . )",
    "moreover , bertola et al .  have proven @xcite that a wightman theory ( as they define it ) on the bulk of ads , again in any spacetime dimension , @xmath12 , will have , as its boundary limit , a ( conformally invariant ) wightman theory on its ( @xmath4-dimensional ) conformal boundary @xmath0[note : wightman]@xmath1 provided the boundary limit of the theory s @xmath13-point functions is defined so as to correspond to a field mapping : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a suitable conformal factor @xmath0[note : confboundary]@xmath1 and @xmath16 an appropriate power .    in the case of the covariant klein gordon equation for mass @xmath2 in the bulk with vanishing boundary conditions",
    ", this boundary - limit holography links the bulk theory in the geometrically natural global ground state ( i.e.  the ground state with respect to ads global time ) on ads to the ( as made clear in @xcite ) same conformal generalized free field theory with anomalous scaling dimension @xmath5 which figures in rehren s algebraic holography correspondence and , in this case , the @xmath16 in equation ( [ delta ] ) above is the same as the @xmath5 in equation ( [ kg ] ) .",
    "we remark that , because the relevant quantum field theories in this case are free ( respectively generalized - free ) the latter boundary theory is fully determined by the boundary limit of the bulk two point function and , when we conformally map the boundary of a poincar chart to @xmath4-dimensional minkowski space , this takes the form , @xmath17^\\delta}\\ ] ] which , by the way , specifies exactly what we mean by ( the two point function of ) a real scalar conformally invariant generalized free field with anomalous scaling dimension @xmath5 .",
    "clearly there are important differences between the bertola et al .  and rehren versions of holography on the one hand ( below",
    ", we shall refer to either / both of these as _ fixed - background holography _ ) and the mainstream work on the maldacena conjecture ( which we shall refer to as _ maldacena holography _ ) .",
    "in particular , in maldacena holography , the bulk theory ( i.e.  a certain superstring theory ) involves a dynamical gravitational field rather than a fixed background .",
    "arnsdorf and smolin @xcite have pointed out a seeming paradox , resulting from this difference .",
    "their point is that , if the quantum field theory on the conformal boundary of ads@xmath18 in the maldacena work ( see note @xmath0[note : adscft]@xmath1 ) is both equivalent  via rehren s algebraic holography  with a bulk quantum theory formulable in terms of a net of local * -algebras on a fixed ads background and also equivalent  via maldacena - holography  with a bulk theory which incorporates quantum gravity , then , it would logically follow that the latter , quantum gravity , theory must be formulable in terms of a net of local * -algebras on a fixed ads background ( with a notion of commutativity at spacelike separation built into its axioms  see @xcite",
    "@xmath0[note : rehgeo]@xmath1 )  which would seem to be in contradiction with evidence ( based on the bending of light etc . )",
    "that einstein gravity is a background - independent theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "some of the objections which have been made to fixed - background holography @xmath0[note : blog]@xmath1 appear to be unfounded .",
    "these objections have to do with the very different - looking prescriptions for obtaining the bulk - boundary correspondence in maldacena holography and in fixed - background holography . in a quantum field",
    "theoretic version of maldacena holography , which is believed to capture much of the essence of the maldacena correspondence in suitable limiting cases , the bulk and boundary theories are thought of as being _ dual _ to one another according to the schematic prescription ( say in a euclidean formulation ) @xcite @xmath19)\\ ] ] where the integral on the right hand side is a path integral and @xmath20 represents the action of an appropriate supergravity theory for fields , schematically represented by @xmath21 , with boundary limit ( defined according to appropriate generalizations of ( [ blim ] ) above ) equal to @xmath22 , while , on the left hand side , @xmath23 is the ` dual ' field on the boundary of ads and is integrated over this boundary with @xmath22 . in a further limiting case which",
    "( see also the discussion in @xcite ) involves ( say , in the case of the ads@xmath24 version of the maldacena correspondence ) a classical supergravity theory in the bulk and a certain large @xmath25 limit of the corresponding cft on the conformal boundary , the above schematic formula gets replaced @xcite by @xmath26)\\ ] ] where @xmath27 $ ] now represents the ( euclidean ) classical action of supergravity for fields ( again , schematically represented by @xmath21 ) with boundary limits ( defined according to appropriate generalizations of ( [ blim ] ) ) equal to @xmath22 .",
    "although , following custom , the correspondences in ( [ dualstring ] ) and ( [ dual ] ) are referred to as _ dualities _ , we note , in passing , that , as emphasized e.g.  in @xcite , which refers to the relation ( [ dualstring ] ) as ` conformal induction ' , [ see also note @xmath0[note : unfortunate]@xmath1 ] the mapping defined by ( [ dualstring ] ) is one way : from bulk to boundary , and , at least not obviously , reversible .",
    "we shall return to this point in section [ sect : discuss ] .    in apparent contrast , in , say , the bertola et al .",
    "boundary limit holography @xcite , the relation between bulk and boundary theories is , as we saw above , that the boundary theory is the _ direct _ boundary limit , ( [ blim ] ) , of the bulk theory and this , at first sight , appears rather different from the ` duality ' in e.g.  the schema ( [ dual ] ) @xmath0[note : unfortunate]@xmath1 .",
    "however , as pointed out by rehren @xcite ( and as rehren notes there , as was also realized in some of the string - theory literature itself ) mainstream work on maldacena holography , based on the duality schema ( [ dual ] ) e.g.  by witten @xcite for a simple model with the bulk covariant klein gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) ( on a fixed bulk background ) leads to exactly the same conformal generalized free field theory ( specified by ( [ wanom ] ) ) with anomalous scaling dimension @xmath5 ( [ delta ] ) on the conformal boundary as that given by bertola et al.s boundary - limit prescription . and",
    "in fact duetsch and rehren @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have given general arguments , valid for an interacting bulk field theory , as to why the direct boundary limit prescription and the duality prescription based on ( [ dual ] ) will give the same boundary theory at least for certain field theories and to all finite orders in perturbation theory  the reasons being not at all trivial .",
    "so in spite of the differences , there would still seem to be at least a valid and interesting ` family resemblance ' between the two types of holography .",
    "as we have discussed , the situations considered in maldacena holography involve theories with very special properties ( involving superstrings in the bulk and very special supersymmetric cfts on the boundary ) and with deep features  in particular a bulk geometry which participates in the dynamics  which are not captured in the bertola et al .  framework and seemingly also not in the rehren framework .",
    "nevertheless , fixed - background holography does appear to capture _ some _ of the more basic features of maldacena holography while having the virtue of being simple enough to admit of fully mathematically controllable formulations .",
    "even if its study were to lead to the conclusion that a fully quantum field theoretic fixed - background holography must necessarily have certain bad properties , it could still be fruitful to try to understand how maldacena holography manages to circumvent these bad properties .",
    "in particular such a study could perhaps contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between full quantum gravity and quantum field theory in curved spacetime , and indicate how , in general ( i.e.  not just in ads / cft situations ) quantum gravity ( as realized by string theory ) manages to resolve some of the difficulties inherent in an approximate semi - classical treatment of quantum gravity based on quantum field theory on fixed backgrounds .",
    "in fact , rehren has already pointed out in @xcite that a fully quantum field theoretic ( fixed - background ) holography will , on his algebraic holography approach , indeed necessarily have ( for 1+@xmath4 dimensional ads when @xmath4 is greater than 1 ) _ potentially _ bad properties in the sense that , while the bulk and boundary theories can both be wightman theories , they can not both be wightman theories which satisfy the time - slice condition @xmath0[note : slice]@xmath1 . in the simple scalar field model discussed above , the bulk theory ( i.e.  the covariant klein gordon equation ) is a wightman theory satisfying the time - slice axiom but the boundary theory ( i.e.  the conformally invariant generalized free field with anomalous scaling dimension @xmath5 as in equation ( [ wanom ] ) ) does nt satisfy the time - slice axiom @xcite and is also known to certainly have bad properties . in particular , we know , thanks e.g.  to the general results of @xcite , that it will have anomalous thermodynamical properties . in general , however , it seems that failing to satisfy the time - slice axiom may not necessarily be bad and there seems to be evidence it could fail ( or at least a lack of evidence that it holds ) for certain physically realistic theories such as non - abelian gauge theories , cf .",
    "this is relevant to the discussion at the end of section [ sect : discuss ] .      in the present article",
    ", we wish to report on an investigation into the fixed - background version of holography due to bertola et al .",
    "( i.e.  _ direct - boundary - limit holography _ ) where , instead of a plain ads bulk spacetime , one considers an asymptotically ads black hole spacetime .",
    "in particular we shall consider the bertola et al .",
    "boundary limit holography @xmath0[note : bhalgholo]@xmath1 for the covariant klein gordon equation with ( for simplicity ) zero mass ( and again with vanishing boundary conditions on the conformal boundary ) on the ( zero angular momentum ) btz spacetime @xcite which , as is well known , can be regarded as a black hole solution to einstein s equations with negative cosmological constant in 1 + 2 dimensions .",
    "mathematically , btz is simpler than its counterparts in higher dimensions in that it is not only globally asymptotically ads but also locally exactly ads  arising in fact from ads by a certain quotient construction @xcite and this construction can be exploited to obtain @xcite the bulk two - point function for the btz - analogue of the hartle - hawking - israel state ( see below ) by the use of an image sum method from the two - point function for the ads global ground state @xcite ( for the case of vanishing boundary conditions on the conformal boundary ) .    here",
    ", we recall that the hartle - hawking - israel state ( hhi state ) @xcite is the unique @xcite quantum state for the covariant klein gordon equation on the kruskal spacetime which is invariant with respect to its one - parameter group of schwarzschild isometries and for which the two - point function has the hadamard form @xcite required to have an everywhere finite renormalized stress - energy tensor . restricted to the exterior schwarzschild spacetime ( i.e.  say , the right wedge of kruskal ) and regarded as a stationary state with respect to schwarzschild time - evolution , it is a thermal equilibrium ( i.e.  kms  see section [ sect : prelim ] ) state at the hawking temperature .",
    "the btz analogue of the hhi state obtained by the image sum mentioned above will have appropriately analogous properties , being , again , a hadamard state and stationary and thermal on the ( say ) right btz wedge at the appropriate hawking temperature with respect to the ( right - btz - wedge preserving ) btz time translations .",
    "from now on , we shall also call this an hhi state , relying on the context to make it clear when we are referring to the btz analogue .",
    "( similarly we shall refer to the hhi state on schwarzschild ads in higher dimensions . )",
    "we shall also consider a simple 1 + 1 dimensional analogue to this bulk theory in which ( cf . again @xcite ) what takes the place ( see figure [ fig : ads2 ] ) of the 1 + 2 dimensional btz spacetime is a certain four - wedge region of the 1 + 1 dimensional ads spacetime ; here the hhi state is just the restriction to the four - wedge region of the ads ground state .",
    "but of course the one - parameter group of ads - isometries which gets identified , under the analogy , with ` btz time - evolution ' in ( say ) the right wedge differs from ( global ) ` ads - time ' .",
    "in fact , it stands in relation to global ads - time in much the same way as rindler time stands in relation to minkowski time  and thus the thermal property can be understood as analogous to the unruh effect @xcite .    for ease of exposition , we shall actually treat this latter , simpler , 1 + 1 dimensional model first and in detail ( in section [ sect:1 + 1 ] ) postponing a concise treatment of the 1 + 2 dimensional case to section [ sect:1 + 2 ] .",
    "our main purpose will be to compare and contrast what happens in this quantum - field - theory - in - curved - spacetime model with what happens in maldacena holography when one considers appropriate superstring / supergravity theories on a schwarzschild - ads bulk .",
    "in particular we shall compare and contrast the different understandings , suggested by each version of holography , of how and why the bulk theory goes over to a thermal theory on the conformal boundary , and we shall compare and contrast the different understandings of the origin of black hole entropy suggested by each version .    as is well - known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) such a bulk geometry will",
    ", when maximally extended , have a conformal boundary which consists of two cylinders ( see figure [ fig : btzcylinders ] )  each cylinder being the conformal boundary of one of the two spacelike exterior - schwarzschild - like ` wedges ' of the maximal extension .",
    "one of the notable results @xcite of the lorentzian signature version of maldacena holography is that the state of the relevant cft on this disconnected boundary is believed to have a restriction to each single cylinder which is a thermal state at the appropriate hawking temperature  the pair of restricted states being mutually entangled in just such a way that the total state on the pair of cylinders is pure . on observing that ( using a euclidean approach and then wick - rotating ) the appropriate replacement for ( [ dualstring ] )",
    "formally implies that the bulk and boundary partition functions coincide , and assuming that this remains true in full string - theoretic maldacena holography , one expects the entropy of the thermal state on each single cylinder to equal the entropy of the bulk which , in turn , one expects ( in a suitable limit of weak string coupling and a large ratio @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the string length scale and for temperatures above the witten phase transition @xcite  see note @xmath0[note : adscft]@xmath1 ) to equal the hawking value ( one quarter of the area of the event horizon @xmath0[note : onequarter]@xmath1 ) of the bekenstein - hawking entropy for the bulk asymptotically ads black hole .",
    "most remarkably , this is indeed the value of the entropy obtained for the thermal state of the cft on a single cylinder .",
    "( in the case of ads@xmath24 with a 1 + 3 dimensional conformal boundary , this agreement can not be checked exactly because one can only calcuate the boundary entropy in a different regime ",
    "see note @xmath0[note : adscft]@xmath1 and the references we cite there .",
    "but the agreement is exact in the ads@xmath31 versions with a btz bulk and a 1 + 1 dimensional conformal boundary  see @xcite and refs . therein . )",
    "one might summarize the situation by saying :    _ in maldacena holography , the ( bulk ) entropy of the black hole ( which equals one quarter of the area of its event horizon ) is equal to the entropy of the dual field on ( say ) the right boundary cylinder . in the bulk entropy calculation in maldacena holography ,",
    "the entropy is regarded ( as it is in euclidean quantum gravity ) as an attribute mainly of the ( dynamical ) quantum gravitational field .",
    "_    we remark , concerning the last sentence of this statement and in preparation for our later discussion ( about the mukohyama - israel ` complementarity ' hypothesis  see below ) that , in the case of asymptotically flat black holes , the hawking value for the entropy ( i.e.  one quarter of the area of the event horizon ) is deriveable directly from the bulk partition function if one calculates this within the framework of euclidean quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "this defines it @xcite as the path integral of the exponential of minus the appropriate euclidean quantum gravity action for einstein gravity with appropriate matter fields and with a suitable boundary geometry periodic in imaginary time with period @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , gibbons and hawking @xcite approximate this by the classical action which they point out is entirely the gravitational action of the relevant classical euclidean black hole solution and they show that this leads to the hawking value for the entropy .",
    "thus , on the assumption ( which gibbons and hawking make ) that the one and higher - loop terms also contributing to the total action ( which represent physically the [ gravity and matter ] ` thermal atmosphere ' of the black hole ) are small , one re - obtains ( approximately ) the hawking value for the entropy .",
    "all these developments were shown by hawking and page to generalize to asymptotically ads black holes in @xcite and indeed , as these authors point out , this case is more satisfactory in that there are stable equilibria involving a black hole surrounded by its thermal atmosphere whereas for schwarzschild black holes , there is the well - known difficulty of negative specific heat @xcite .",
    "we want to draw particular attention to the importance , in this explanation of the origin of the hawking value for the entropy , of the assumption that the entropy of the thermal atmosphere is small ( or perhaps , alternatively , for some other reason , neglectable ) . in @xcite hawking argues for its smallness by proposing that this term will be well - approximated by the entropy of an equal metrical volume of thermal radiation in flat spacetime and points out that , in relevant situations , this will indeed be small compared to the hawking value of the black hole entropy . in the work in @xcite on the thermodynamics of schwarzschild ads , it appears to be tacitly assumed that the entropy of the corresponding thermal atmosphere can similarly be neglected , and/or estimated as the ( again , small ) entropy of thermal radiation at the same temperature in plain ads for the same cosmological constant ( but without a black hole ) .",
    "as we shall discuss further below , this raises a puzzle ( related to the mukohyama - israel ` complementarity ' principle which we discuss below ) because , as we shall see , the ( lorentzian ) brick wall approach ( which we advocate ) leads us to conclude that , in addition to the small ` volume ' piece , the thermal atmosphere entropy also has a piece proportional to the area of the event horizon which is comparable in size to the hawking value of the black hole entropy .",
    "in fact , as we shall see in section [ sect : brick ] , for our scalar klein gordon equation on the ( 1 + 2 dimensional ) btz background , the brick wall approach entails that the area piece is substantial while ( with the approximation we use ) the volume piece vanishes !    turning next from maldacena holography back to fixed - background holography , if we assume our bulk theory ( i.e.  the covariant klein gordon equation on the maximally extended btz spacetime with vanishing boundary conditions on the conformal boundary ) to be in the hhi state , then , one of us ( lo ) @xcite has obtained , by taking a direct boundary limit as in ( [ blim ] ) , a similar result involving two mutually entangled thermal states ( i.e.  for the conformal generalized free field with anomalous scaling dimension @xmath5 ( [ delta ] ) ) on the same pair of boundary cylinders  again at the relevant hawking temperature @xmath0[note : bhalgholo]@xmath1 .",
    "this result had previously been obtained , with reference to the duality schema ( [ dual ] ) , for the same covariant klein gordon model , by keski - vakkuri @xcite ( and quoted in the paper by maldacena @xcite to which we referred above ) .",
    "however , the method by which they are obtained in @xcite , summarized here in sections [ sect:1 + 1 ] and [ sect:1 + 2 ] , may be of interest as an alternative derivation , closer in spirit to the boundary - limit holography work of @xcite .",
    "one can , in fact , argue on general grounds ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , using the algebraic approach to quantum field theory ( see section [ sect : prelim ] ) that the direct boundary limit on the pair of cylinders of a bulk theory defined on btz would be expected @xmath0[note : expect]@xmath1 to inherit the entanglement and thermal properties of the bulk theory in this way . to argue this ,",
    "we note first that we would expect that the quantum dynamical system @xmath33 consisting of the * -algebra for the btz double wedge ( i.e.  in the 1 + 1 dimensional analogue , the union of the triangles acf and ced in figure [ fig : ads2 ] ) together with the one - parameter group of automorphisms induced by the one - parameter group of wedge - preserving btz isometries to be equivalent to the quantum dynamical system @xmath34 consisting of the * -algebra for the appropriate boundary theory on the ` double cylinder ' ",
    "i.e.  the union of the right and left boundary cylinders  together with the one - parameter group of automorphisms which time - translates towards the future on the right cylinder and toward the past on the left cylinder ( this arising from the one - parameter group of conformal isometries  actually isometries  on the boundary inherited from the one - parameter group of wedge - preserving isometries in the bulk ) .",
    "thus , to every bulk state ( i.e.  positive normalized linear functional on @xmath35  see section [ sect : prelim ] )  with given entanglement properties and given thermal properties with respect to @xmath36 , one expects an equivalent boundary state with equivalent entanglement properties and equivalent thermal properties with respect to @xmath37 @xmath0[note : equiv]@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we expect that suitably smeared boundary limits ( in the sense of ( [ blim ] ) ) of bulk fields will be identifiable with elements of the * -algebra for the appropriate boundary theory on the union of the right and left boundary cylinders in such a way that the action of bulk time - translations goes over to the action of the above - mentioned cylinder time - translations .",
    "( further , we expect all these expectations to generalize from btz to schwarzschild ads in other dimenions . )",
    "however , a formal calculation now results in an _ infinite _",
    "value for the entropy of each of these ( bulk and boundary ) thermal states .",
    "this infinite entropy should not have been a surprise for two rather different reasons which we point out below .",
    "first , we remark that the bulk and boundary entropies are expected , on general grounds , necessarily to be equal and thus , if one is infinite , then so must the other be .",
    "in fact , @xmath0[note : ham]@xmath1 , we expect the hamiltonian generating the btz - analogue of schwarzschild time - evolution in the btz - analogue of the boulware vacuum representation @xcite for the field * -algebra in the right btz wedge to be unitarily equivalent to the hamiltonian generating time - evolution in the ground - state representation for the field algebra on the right cylinder .",
    "thus , since the entropy of a thermal state ( at any inverse temperature , @xmath38 ) is given by the standard formulae @xmath39 where @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and since the trace is a unitary invariant , if the hamiltonians are unitarily equivalent , then the entropies must necessarily be equal .",
    "the first reason why we expect this entropy to be infinite , is , thinking of the entropy as the boundary entropy , because of the ` bad thermodynamics ' of the conformal generalized free field theory with anomalous scaling dimension @xmath5 ( see ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ wanom ] ) ) on the conformal boundary which we mentioned above .",
    "the second reason why we expect this entropy to be infinite , now thinking of the entropy as bulk entropy , is because we expect the bulk hamiltonian ( and thus also , by the unitary equivalence , the boundary hamiltonian ) to have continuous spectrum whereupon , of course , the trace in the definitions of @xmath42 and @xmath43 above will be infinite .",
    "we next turn to discuss the reason why we expect the bulk hamiltonian to have continuous spectrum and explain the relevance of the brick wall model .",
    "the reason for the continuous spectrum is essentially the same as the reason that the spectrum of the ` boulware hamiltonian ' @xcite on the right schwarzschild wedge of the kruskal spacetime ( i.e.  the hamiltonian generating schwarzschild time - evolution in the ground - state representation of the * -algebra for the right schwarzschild wedge ) is continuous , even when one encloses the field in a box at some large schwarzschild radius ( the @xmath44 of equation ( [ sapprox ] ) ) and imposes ( say ) vanishing boundary conditions at the wall of this box .",
    "this continuous spectrum , in turn , is what is responsbile for the fact that the entropy of the hhi state for the same system is infinite even when enclosed in a large box .",
    "this sort of infinity is in fact well - known in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime ; it also occurs , e.g. for the minkowski vacuum state restricted to a rindler wedge ( again , even when enclosed in a box at large rindler spatial coordinate ) in minkowski space .",
    "its origin may regarded as due to the fact that ( in the kruskal example ) as far as schwarzschild wave - modes of our covariant klein - gordon equation are concerned , the relevant radial coordinate is not the metrical distance from the horizon @xmath0[note : metrical]@xmath1 but rather the appropriate regge - wheeler or ` tortoise ' coordinate @xmath45 , related to the schwarzschild @xmath46 by @xmath47 which , if taken as a sort of ` distance ' measure places the horizon infinitely far away from any exterior point .",
    "( in minkowski space it is the rindler coordinate , @xmath48 , related , at minkowski time @xmath49 , to minkowski @xmath50 coordinate by @xmath51  see e.g.  @xcite . ) alternatively , it may be regarded as due to the fact that the local temperature ( relative to schwarzschild time or rindler time  see section [ sect : prelim ] ) tends to infinity as one approaches the horizon  like inverse metrical distance .",
    "following t hooft @xcite and subsequent authors ( see especially the important correction and clarification to the brick wall approach due to mukohyama and israel @xcite ) it is well known  for say the schwarzschild metric  that , for any linear model field theory , one will obtain a hamiltonian with discrete spectrum if one encloses the system in a large box and also separates it from the horizon by another wall ( called a ` brick wall ' in @xcite ) just outside the horizon where , say , vanishing boundary conditions are again imposed . if one does this , and takes the system between the brick wall and the box wall to be at the appropriate hawking temperature , the entropy of the resulting system turns out to be finite .",
    "it turns out ( in the case of the massless klein gordon field ) to consist of the sum of a ` volume ' piece which is close in magnitude to the entropy of the same klein gordon field in an equal metrical volume of flat space and an ` area piece ' which is proportional to the area of the event horizon .    also following t hooft and mukohyama and israel",
    ", we shall assume that the fields which actually exist in nature can be modelled , for thermodynamic purposes , by a number , @xmath52 @xmath0[note : micorrection]@xmath1 , of ` effective ( real massless ) klein gordon fields ' in the sense that their combined entropy will be @xmath52 times the entropy of a single ( real massless ) klein gordon field .    by adjusting , ` by hand ' , the metrical distance , @xmath53 , from the brick wall to the horizon to be ( approximately ) the planck length ( i.e.  by taking @xmath54 in natural units ) one then finds that the area piece of the entropy is significantly large",
    "in fact , following the treatment of @xcite , one obtains the hawking value for the proportionality constant , i.e.  one quarter , provided one takes @xmath55 to be of the order of ( only ) 300 or so .",
    "( in fact , for the area piece to take the hawking value , one requires @xmath56 to have the value @xmath57 .",
    "see note @xmath0[note:300]@xmath1 for details . )",
    "this of course does not prove that it is physically correct to take @xmath54 and @xmath58 and , in particular , it does not prove that all the entropy of a black hole arises in this way .",
    "but it does suggest that at least a substantial part of it does . and it is then tempting to argue , as t hooft and mukohyama and israel do , that the entire entropy of a black hole can be seen as arising in this way and that this way of arriving at the entropy should be thought of as a _",
    "complementary description _ of black hole entropy to the description of it as arising from the gibbons - hawking euclidean classical gravitational action @xmath0[note : complementarity]@xmath1 which we discussed above .",
    "thus with mukohyama and israel s proposed complementarity principle , it seems that such a brick - wall modification of a quantum field theory near a horizon is able to mimic what we believe ( see note @xmath0[note : onequarter]@xmath1 ) would be an exact and correct result for the entropy of a black hole in a full quantum gravitational treatment .",
    "moreover , by the way , if one accepts their argument , then the number 300 may be regarded ( see note @xmath0[note:300]@xmath1 ) as an order of magnitude prediction for the effective number of matter fields needed in any consistent quantum theory of gravity describing physics in 1 + 3 dimensions .",
    "the mukohyama and israel complementarity principle actually embodies , what is , for us , a second puzzle ( our first being that of arnsdorf and smolin ) .",
    "after all , as we just remarked , the ` volume ' piece of the entropy can be estimated as the entropy of thermal radiation at the hawking temperature in flat space in a box of the same metrical volume .",
    "thus it may , presumably , be identified with the ` small ' volume piece which hawking proposed for the entropy of the thermal atmosphere in the euclidean quantum gravity approach to black hole entropy which we discussed earlier . however , as we anticipated in that discussion , and as we have just seen , with the brick wall approach , the main part of the entropy of the thermal atmosphere is expected to be the piece proportional to the area of the event horizon which , following mukohyama and israel @xcite can , as we just saw , plausibly already account for the full hawking entropy of the black hole .",
    "thus it seems one is forced to conclude , with mukohyama and israel , that , for reasons we perhaps do not yet understand , the thermal atmosphere ( perhaps both the [ small ] volume and the [ large ] area pieces ) should not be added to the gravitational entropy of a black hole ( which already accounts for the full hawking value for its entropy ) but rather should be regarded as an alternative calculation ( or ` complementary description ' ) of the same physical quantity .",
    "( see section [ sect : discuss ] for further discussion . )",
    "returning to the case of interest here of schwarzschild - ads black holes , a similar brick - wall scenario is applicable ( see e.g.   @xcite  but see note @xmath0[note : complementarity]@xmath1 ) and we note that , in this case , a large box is no longer needed and gets replaced by imposing vanishing boundary conditions on our quantum field(s ) on the conformal boundary ( i.e.  at spacelike infinity ) .",
    "again one expects the entropy to consist of the sum of a ` volume ' piece and a piece proportional to horizon area ( i.e.  circumference in the case of btz ) .",
    "as we have already remarked above , it turns out @xcite that in the case of 1 + 2 dimensional btz ( at least to a good approximation ) the entire entropy ( see equation ( [ 1plus2bricksecondresult ] ) in section [ sect : brick ] ) is proportional to the circumference of the horizon ( i.e.  the appropriate notion of ` horizon area ' in 1 + 2 dimensions ) and , strikingly , the ` volume piece ' vanishes .",
    "( again in line with the mukohyama - israel complementarity principle / puzzle , this is in sharp contrast to the assumptions of hawking and page in their work @xcite on the thermodynamics of schwarzschild ads , where it is assumed that the only term which goes like horizon area is the term arising from the zero - loop gravitational action . )",
    "we shall re - derive this result here , by applying the method and ideas of mukohyama and israel @xcite in section [ sect : brick ] .",
    "we find , by the way , that , for a brick wall of metrical distance 1 natural unit from the horizon , the entropy will equal the usual hawking value ( one quarter of the circumference ) provided the matter fields behave as an effective number of around 34 klein gordon fields .",
    "( in fact , by the results of section [ sect : brick ] , the entropy will take the hawking value if @xmath59 .",
    "the discussion of the 1 + 3 dimensional schwarzschild case above , where the corresponding quantity , @xmath60 , needed to take a value around 300 . )",
    "( as far as we are aware this has not been pointed out before . )    at a computational level , our main new development in the present paper is that we show , in section [ sect : brick ] , in our 1 + 1 and 1 + 2 dimensional btz models with a single real massless klein gordon field @xmath0[note : mass]@xmath1 , that the introduction of a suitable brick wall into the bulk alters the state induced from the appropriate bulk thermal state by the direct boundary limit ( [ blim ] ) on our ( say ) right cylinder boundary ( in the case of 1 + 1 dimensional btz , right boundary line ) in such a way that the altered boundary state remains a thermal state at the hawking temperature , but in such a way that the boundary hamiltonian has a discrete spectrum and the state induced on the boundary has a finite entropy .",
    "in fact , in both 1 + 1 and 1 + 2 dimensional cases , the finite boundary entropy is equal to the finite brick - wall - modified bulk entropy .",
    "we may summarize much of what we have said above with the statement :    _ we assume we can mimic a matter atmosphere realistically enough by considering a multiplet of @xmath52 ( massless ) klein gordon fields on btz . by introducing a suitable brick wall ,",
    "the entropy of this model thermal atmosphere becomes finite and is equal to the entropy of the cft on the conformal boundary obtained from the brick - wall modified bulk theory with fixed - background ( specifically direct - boundary - limit ) holography .",
    "moreover , by adjusting the metrical distance , @xmath53 , from the brick wall to the horizon to be around 1 in natural units ( i.e.  around the ` planck length '  see section [ sect : prelim ] ) , the entropy can be made to equal the hawking value of one quarter of the area ( i.e.  circumference ) of the event horizon by taking @xmath61 to be around 34 . in the bulk entropy calcuation in the brick wall approach",
    ", the entropy is regarded as an attribute of a collection of ( mainly ) matter fields propagating on a fixed gravitational background . _",
    "a comparison of our two italicized displayed statements above seems to suggest a new and interesting connection between , on the one hand , the puzzling contrast between maldacena holography and fixed - background holography  as highlighted e.g.  by arnsdorf and smolin s paradox  and , on the other hand , the puzzle embodied in the mukohyama - israel complementarity principle , according to which the ( entire ) entropy of a black hole should describable either as the entropy derived from the zero - loop quantum gravitational partition function , or , in a complementary description , as the entropy of its thermal ( mostly matter ) atmosphere .",
    "in fact our first italicized statements above indicates that maldacena holography goes together with the first description and our second italicized sentence indicates that fixed - background holography goes together with the second description .",
    "thus , we have pointed out an apparently interesting and new connection between the two puzzles .      after a section ( section [ sect : prelim ] )",
    "entitled preliminaries , we recall the relevant facts about direct boundary - limit holography for btz , treating the 1 + 1 dimensional case in section [ sect:1 + 1 ] and the 1 + 2 dimensional case in section [ sect:1 + 2 ] . for each case , we construct the hhi state for a single massless klein gordon field and show that its direct boundary limit on ( say ) the right boundary cylinder (= boundary line in the 1 + 1 case ) is a thermal state at the relevant hawking temperature .",
    "then , in section [ sect : brick ] we introduce the brick wall and show that the brick - wall modified hhi state for a collection of @xmath52 massless klein gordon fields remains a thermal state on the right boundary cylinder ( /line ) at the hawking temperature , but now has a finite entropy given by equation ( [ 1plus2bricksecondresult ] ) and that this is equal to the entropy of the state induced on the boundary from the brick - wall modified hhi state .",
    "in the first part of our discussion section  subsection [ subsect : summary ] of section [ sect : discuss ]  we summarize our main results . in the second part (",
    "subsections [ subsect : working ] to [ subsect : dual ] ) we discuss further our two puzzles , i.e.  those of arnsdorf and smolin and of mukohyama and israel , in the light of our results and with reference to the ads@xmath18 version of maldacena holography  and we discuss what conclusions can be drawn , in the light of our results , regarding these puzzles .",
    "we shall work on the assumption that our main results and , in particular , the equality of bulk and boundary entropies ( in the presence of suitable brick walls ) will hold for bulk qft other than the klein gordon theory and for schwarzschild ads in dimensions other than 1 + 2 .",
    "we shall also recall the proposed resolution to the mukohyama - israel puzzle due to one of us ( bsk ) based on the ` matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis ' of references @xcite .",
    "the main tentative conclusions we arrive at , and our arguments for them , may be very briefly summarized as follows : first we shall argue from this latter hypothesis that , in maldacena ads / cft , the algebra of the boundary cft is isomorphic only to a proper subalgebra of the bulk algebra , albeit ( at non - zero temperature ) the ( gns ) hilbert spaces of bulk and boundary theories are still the ` same '  the total bulk state being pure , while the boundary state is mixed ( thermal ) .",
    "secondly , we shall argue from the finiteness of its boundary ( and hence , on our assumptions , also bulk ) entropy at finite temperature , that the rehren dual of the maldacena boundary cft can not itself be a qft and must , instead , presumably be something like a string theory .",
    "as we say again , at the end of section [ sect : discuss ] , while these tentative conclusions still do not resolve the arndorf - smolin puzzle , they seem to go at least some of the way towards a possible resolution .",
    "we adopt signature ( + , -,-,- ) . concerning units : in the main part of the paper , we omit all factors of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ( boltzmann s constant ) from our formulae and so regard all physical quantities as pure numbers . in 1 + 3 dimensions , where theory can be compared with experiment ,",
    "this of course amounts to using planck units in which lengths are multiples of the planck length ( @xmath66 cm ) , times are multiples of the planck time ( @xmath67 sec ) and masses are multiples of the planck mass ( @xmath68 g ) .",
    "( in note @xmath0[note : adscft]@xmath1 and section [ sect : discuss ] we shall restore @xmath64 . )",
    "we use the symbol ` @xmath69 ' to denote ` of the order of ' and ` @xmath70 ' to denote approximate equality .",
    "the appropriate mathematical framework for quantum theory in curved spacetime is the algebraic approach to quantum field theory ",
    "see @xcite for the general framework and @xcite and @xcite for the specific application to linear quantum field theories in curved spacetime such as that of our klein gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) .",
    "we briefly recall some of the salient points although many of the details will only be needed in the notes section ( section [ sect : notes ] ) .",
    "observables are regarded as self - adjoint elements of a * -algebra , for which we shall typically use the symbol @xmath71 , and a state , @xmath72 , on @xmath71 is a positive normalized linear functional and , in the case of a quantum field theory , is specified in practice by listing all of its ( smeared ) @xmath13-point functions .",
    "the gns representation of a * -algebra , @xmath71 , for a choice of state , @xmath72 , is a representation , @xmath43 , of @xmath71 as operators on a hilbert space @xmath73 , together with a vector , @xmath74 such that @xmath75 is _ cyclic _ for @xmath43 ( meaning the set @xmath76 is dense in @xmath73 ) and satisfies @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , if we have an algebraic quantum dynamical system @xmath78 consisting of a * -algebra , @xmath79 , together with a one - parameter group , @xmath80 , of ` time - translation ' automorphisms , @xmath80 , then there will be a one - parameter unitary group @xmath81 ( which we shall assume to be strongly continuous and which will , hence , arise in the form @xmath82 ) for a self - adjoint ` hamiltonian generator ' , @xmath83 , on the gns hilbert space @xmath73 which _ implements _ @xmath80 in the sense that @xmath84 .",
    "it is well - known and easy to show that @xmath81 is fixed uniquely if we demand @xmath85 ( i.e.  @xmath86 ) for all @xmath87 .",
    "when such a condition holds for each of two equivalent quantum dynamical systems @xmath88 and @xmath89 , then one easily sees that the hamiltonian generators , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , say , must then be equivalent in the sense that there exists an isomorphim @xmath92 such that @xmath93    whenever we refer to a ` ground state ' or to a ` thermal state ' at some given ` inverse temperature ' , there is always , at least implicitly , a notion of ` time ' being assumed and so these notions are defined formally relative to a given quantum dynamical system @xmath78 .",
    "a state , @xmath72 on the @xmath71 of such a dynamical system is said to be a ground state if its hamiltonian generator , defined , and made unique as in the above paragraph , is a positive operator .",
    "ground states are characterised by having two - point functions which are translationally invariant and , regarded as functions of @xmath94 , say , are the boundary limits of holomorphic functions in the lower half @xmath95 plane ( and an appropriate statement for other @xmath13-point functions ) .",
    "the two - point function of a thermal state , at inverse temperature , @xmath38 , will satisfy the kms condition ( see again @xcite for the general theory and especially @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for the case of linear field theories in curved spacetimes and see also @xcite ) which means that it is , again , translationally invariant in time and extends to a function , @xmath64 of @xmath94 which is holomorphic in the strip , @xmath96 such that the boundary value , @xmath97 equals the boundary value @xmath98 .",
    "we note that , if @xmath83 is a hamiltonian on a hilbert space @xmath73 and if @xmath99 is finite , then the state , @xmath100 , defined on operators , @xmath101 , on @xmath73 by @xmath102 will be a kms state at inverse temperature @xmath38 and its gns hilbert space will , in a certain sense explained in @xcite ( cf . also the ` thermo - field dynamics ' of takahashi and umezawa @xcite ) be larger than @xmath103 ( in fact @xmath104 ) and may be thought of as carrying a representation of a pure state ( the ` purification ' of @xmath100 ) on a larger system whose reduced density operator on @xmath73 is equal to @xmath105 .",

    "finally , we note that , for metrics of the above spherically symmetric form , if a horizon is located at @xmath115 , indicated by the vanishing of @xmath116 , then its surface gravity , @xmath117 is equal to @xmath118 .",

    "one of us ( lo , see @xcite ) has shown that if one quantizes the klein gordon equation , ( [ kg ] ) , for an arbitrary mass on ads with vanishing boundary conditions on the conformal boundary , then the boundary limit of the two point function in either the global ground state or the poincar ground state @xmath0[note : poincareglobalequiv]@xmath1 is , when expressed in poincar coordinates , given by    @xmath237    where @xmath5 is given by ( [ delta ] ) with @xmath238 .    from ( [ e:107 ] ) and ( [ e:112 ] ) we find that ,",

    "now , as discussed in the introduction , we expect the hhi state on btz to be the natural state induced on btz by the ads ground state on ads when one quotients by the equivalence relation @xmath236 .",

    "in fact , as already discussed by maldacena in @xcite , the boundary limit of the hhi state on the union of the left cylinder and the right cylinder is expected to be , what in our language ( see note @xmath0[note : equiv]@xmath1 and @xcite ) we would call a double - kms state ",
    "i.e.  kms with respect to the appropriate @xmath95 ( going to the future on the right cylinder and the past on the left cylinder ) when restricted to either of the cylinders but entangled in just such a way as to be pure .",
    "( see @xcite for the two point function with one point in the right cylinder and one in the left and cf .",
    "similar formulae in @xcite and @xcite ) ( a similar remark could of course have been made about @xmath247 . )",
    "in sections [ sect:1 + 1 ] and [ sect:1 + 2 ] we have seen that , in 1 + 1 dimensional and 1 + 2 dimensional btz , the appropriate hhi state ",
    "i.e.  the global ( @xmath7 poincar ) ads ground state in the 1 + 1 dimensional case and the state ( with two point function defined by the appropriate image sum ) inherited from the global ads ground state ( see note @xmath0[note : poincareglobalequiv]@xmath1 ) under the btz quotient construction in the 1 + 2 dimensional case  goes over to a state on the ( say , right ) boundary line ( in 1 + 1 ) or cylinder ( in 1 + 2 ) which is a kms state at the appropriate hawking temperature .",
    "moreover , although we have not derived this explicitly here , it is straightforward to check that each of these bulk hhi states is a kms state at the hawking temperature with respect to btz time translations in , say , the right btz wedge ( and is a ` double kms state ' on the bulk double wedge  cf . e.g.  the discussion after ( [ ttrelation ] ) and note @xmath0[note : equiv]@xmath1 ) .",
    "so it is fair to say that , in boundary - limit holography for btz , the thermal nature of the hhi state in the bulk is faithfully reflected by the thermal nature of its boundary limit on the ( say ) right conformal boundary .",
    "however , in line with our discussion in the introduction , in both cases , both bulk and boundary state have infinite entropy  corresponding to the fact that , if we attempt , formally , to express these states as gibbs states , with , say , in the case of 1 + 1 dimensional bulk btz , two - point function defined by @xmath249 etc . , where the fields are represented in the appropriate ground - state ( or ` boulware ' ) representation , @xmath41 , @xmath250 , and @xmath83 is the appropriate hamiltonian",
    ", then @xmath83 will have continuous spectrum and so the trace in the standard formula @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( as well as the trace in the definition , @xmath41 , of @xmath42 itself ) will not really exist  or be ` infinite ' .",
    "( and similarly on the boundary and similarly for bulk and boundary in the 1 + 2 dimensional case ) .    to remedy this , we will adopt the brick - wall approach of t hooft @xcite and of mukohyama and israel @xcite and others , as discussed in the introduction , and introduce a suitable ` brick wall ' in the bulk so as to make the bulk entropy finite .",
    "we shall then take the boundary limit of the brick - wall modified thermal two - point function at the hawking temperature and , in the case of our 1 + 1 dimensional btz with our zero - mass klein gordon equation , find the explicit form of the boundary - limit two - point function and show that this is both thermal at the hawking temperature ( for an appropriately , brick - wall modified boundary hamiltonian ) and also has the same finite entropy as the bulk brick - wall modified state .",
    "we shall calculate the bulk entropy in the 1 + 1 dimensional brick wall model by the mukohyama - israel approximation method @xcite and show that , for this case , this method reproduces the exact result .    in the 1 + 2 dimensional btz case ,",
    "we shall re - obtain , by the same mukohyama - israel approximation method , the result of kim et al .",
    "@xcite which is that ( at least to a good approximation ) the brick - wall modified bulk entropy is proportional to the ` area ' ( i.e circumference ) of the event horizon .",
    "we shall also obtain in - principle exact sums ( albeit difficult to perform explicitly ) for the bulk brick - wall modified two - point function and its boundary limit and show , without summing explicitly , that the bulk and boundary entropies must be exactly equal .",
    "we locate our brick wall , in btz coordinates , at @xmath251 where @xmath252 is suitably small .",
    "this is a natural choice since it respects btz time - translational invariance . in figure",
    "[ fig : ads2 ] , the brick wall is a smooth curve joining d to e and passing just to the right of the piecewise - linear curve dce . our aim is to quantize our field to the right of this brick wall , with vanishing boundary conditions on the brick wall as well as on the conformal boundary .",
    "the hamiltonian will , as expected , turn out to have discrete spectrum .",
    "so we will be able to construct a thermal state ( with inverse hawking temperature , @xmath250 ) as a gibbs state in the ground - state representation .    to do all this , it is convenient to work in @xmath253 coordinates , where the tortoise - like coordinate ( cf .",
    "( [ schwtortoise ] ) ) @xmath254 , is related to the btz @xmath255 coordinate of ( [ e : bb3 ] ) and ( [ e:16 ] ) by @xmath256 with solution @xmath257    the metric is then given by @xmath258    on the full exterior btz region , @xmath254 ranges from @xmath259 at the btz horizon to @xmath189 at the ads boundary ( where @xmath260 ) .",
    "however , the brick wall will lie at the finite value @xmath261 , where @xmath262 .",
    "so , the classical theory which we wish to quantize is the massless covariant klein - gordon equation , which , in @xmath253 coordinates , becomes @xmath263 with the boundary conditions @xmath264 by essentially the same arguments which we gave for the form of @xmath155 in equation ( [ 2dmasslessg ] ) , the two - point function for the ground state for this theory then takes the form @xmath265 @xmath266 where @xmath267 stands for @xmath268 , @xmath269 . in other words",
    ", it is the same as the two - point function of a ( real ) massless klein gordon field in a strip , @xmath270 of 1 + 1 dimensional minkowski space with vanishing boundary conditions at its edges .",
    "in fact , as may readily be checked , ( [ e:148b ] ) may be derived by the usual creation and annihilation operator method , for mode functions adapted to these boundary conditions .    to get a suitable boundary limit of @xmath271 , we expect , in accordance with ( [ blim ] ) , that the right thing to do will be to multiply ( [ e:148b ] ) by @xmath272 and then to take the limit as @xmath273 and @xmath274 both tend to zero . to this end , we notice first that @xmath275 .",
    "also , recalling that @xmath276 is given by equation ( [ btztortoise ] ) one easily sees that the inverse function , @xmath276 is @xmath277 from which we see that when @xmath255 is large ( i.e.  @xmath254 is close to @xmath189 ) we have @xmath278 ( we can actually also see this directly from ( [ btztortoise ] ) ) and hence @xmath279 . in fact , one easily sees , with these considerations , that the above ` right thing to do ' amounts to taking the limit as @xmath273 and @xmath274 tend to zero of @xmath280 times @xmath281 which is easily seen to be @xmath282    as one can see from the discreteness of the sum in ( [ e:148b ] ) ( or from the discreteness of the modes in its derivation with creation and annihilation operators ) the ` one - particle hamiltonian ' , @xmath283 , whose second quantization @xmath284 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) generates bulk btz time - evolution in the region to the right of our brick wall , has discrete spectrum , with , in fact , eigenvalues @xmath285 , @xmath286 ( and multiplicity 1 ) .",
    "thus @xmath287 will have discrete spectrum too . and , from ( [ e:149b ] )",
    ", we may conclude that , also , the one - particle hamiltonian generating time - evolution on the btz boundary for the ( conformal , generalized - free , with scaling dimension @xmath170 ) ) boundary restriction of this bulk theory has the same spectrum , as will also _ its _ second quantization .",
    "in fact it will clearly be unitarily equivalent to @xmath283 , so we will also call it @xmath283 and its second quantization @xmath287 .    because the spectra are discrete  more precisely , because @xmath288 is finite  we may thus compute the bulk and boundary thermal two - point functions @xmath289 and @xmath290 at the appropriate inverse hawking temperature @xmath250 .",
    "e.g.  by using creation and annihilation operator methods again , these are easily calculated to be @xmath291 and @xmath292 both of which are easily seen to satisfy the kms condition ( see section [ sect : prelim ] ) for this @xmath38 .",
    "we also notice that , just as we obtained @xmath293 ( [ e:149b ] ) from @xmath271 ( [ e:148b ] ) , we could have obtained @xmath294 ( [ e:152b ] ) as the limit as @xmath273 and @xmath274 tend to zero of @xmath280 times @xmath295 ( [ e:150b ] ) .    recalling that @xmath267 stands for @xmath268",
    ", we notice that ( [ e:152b ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath296 in the limit as the brick wall is removed , @xmath297 tends to infinity and we expect this to be well - approximated by replacing the sum over @xmath13 by an integral over , say , @xmath151 . after making the substitution @xmath298 we will thus have @xmath299 which @xmath0[note : gradshteyn]@xmath1 is equal to @xmath300 which , recalling that @xmath301 , agrees with ( [ e:100 ] ) .",
    "this confirms that the brick wall does what we anticipated in section [ sect : intro ] that it would do in this case :    _ the boundary limit of the thermal state at the hawking temperature built on the modification , due to the presence of the brick wall , to the boundary limit of the btz ground state ( i.e.  the ` boulware state ' ) tends , as the brick wall is removed , to the boundary limit of the btz hhi state .",
    "_    although we have not shown it expicitly here , the corresponding ( and more straightforward ) statement also holds for the bulk theory : the bulk thermal state at the hawking temperature built on the brick - wall modified btz ground state tends , as the brick wall is removed , to the btz hhi state ( restricted to the right btz wedge ) .    moreover , we saw above that ( again in line with what we anticipated in section [ sect : intro ] ",
    "see note @xmath0[note : ham]@xmath1 ) in the presence of the brick wall , the hamiltonians for the bulk and boundary theory are unitarily equivalent mathematical operators .",

    "we next calculate the value of this entropy .    in this simple massless 1 + 1 dimensional btz case , we can in fact calculate the entropy exactly : in fact , thinking of it as bulk entropy , in view of equations ( [ e:142b ] ) and ( [ e:143b ] ) etc . , for given @xmath303 , it is just the usual entropy for a special relativistic real free scalar field in a ` one - dimensional box ' ( i.e.  line ) of length @xmath297 in thermal equilibrium at temperature , @xmath110 , which is given ( to a very good approximation @xmath0[note : scalarentropy]@xmath1 ) by the ( standard ) formula : @xmath304 taking @xmath110 here to be the appropriate hawking temperature , which we take to be @xmath305 ( @xmath306 ) , this is @xmath307    it is also instructive to apply the approximation method of mukohyama and israel @xcite to this case . for any metric with the spherically symmetric ` schwarzschild - like ' form ( [ generalsphmetric ] ) of any spacetime dimension",

    "however we have not shown this explicitly and , to do so , one would need to have more mathematical control on the values of the @xmath329 .",
    "what is important for us is that it is clear from the above that ( even in the absence of any mathematical control on the values of the @xmath329 ) similarly to the 1 + 1 dimensional case , the one particle hamiltonians generating time evolution in both bulk and boundary in the ground - state representations corresponding to each of the brick - wall - modified two - point functions , @xmath350 ( [ e:160b ] ) and @xmath351 ( [ e:161b ] ) are both unitarily equivalent to one another ( both being the second quantizations , @xmath287 , of the one - particle hamiltonian , @xmath283 , with non - degenerate spectrum now consisting of the @xmath329 ( taken with appropriate multiplicity if / when any of these turn out to be degenerate ) .",
    "so , just as in the 1 + 1 dimensional case , we expect that , in the presence of the brick wall , both bulk and boundary will have finite @xmath0[note : omeganmcondition]@xmath1 ( and equal ! ) von neumann entropies , given by @xmath302 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath83 now meaning @xmath287 with @xmath283 ( with spectrum consisting of the @xmath329 ) as in the previous paragraph .",
    "it turns out to be difficult to compute this entropy exactly , because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient mathematical control over the @xmath329 although an attempt to do so was made by ichinose and satoh @xcite .",
    "instead , we have applied the approximation method of mukohyama and israel , which we also used above in the 1 + 1 dimensional case , to obtain equations ( [ 1plus2brickfirstresult ] ) and ( [ 1plus2bricksecondresult ] ) below .",

    "moreover , following the line of argument of mukohyama and israel @xcite , if the metrical distance , @xmath53 , from the brick wall to the horizon is taken to be @xmath69 1 in natural units ( see section [ sect : prelim ] ) then , for @xmath52 around @xmath370 , the total matter entropy will take the hawking value of @xmath371 .",
    "this suggests that a consistent theory of quantum gravity ( with cosmological constant ) in 1 + 2 dimensions will require a collection of matter fields equivalent to a number , @xmath52 , within an order of magnitude of 34 or so of ( massless , real ) effective klein gordon fields .",
    "we remark that , with a brick wall in the ( 1 + 3 dimensional ) schwarzschild metric , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and for finite @xmath44 in ( [ sapprox ] ) , the entropy arises as a sum of a ( large ) ` area piece ' , due to a small region near the brick wall and proportional to horizon area , and a ( typically smaller ) ` volume piece ' associated with the region far away from the horizon .",
    "in contrast , in the case of btz , even though @xmath44 is now taken to be @xmath172 , we see from equation ( [ 1plus2bricksecondresult ] ) that  at least in our ( @xmath7 kim et al.s @xcite ) approximation  our entire entropy consists of an ` area piece ' and the ` volume piece ' vanishes !",
    "we have provided general evidence that , at least for our simple massless klein gordon equation model , there seem to be well - defined versions of fixed - background holography , not only for plain ads , but also for certain asymptotically ads spacetimes , such as , in @xmath372 dimensions , the schwarzschild - ads black hole spacetime . in particular , specializing to 1 + 2 dimensions ( btz ) we have confirmed that the boundary theory is ( locally ) the same ( i.e.  that for the conformal generalized free field with anomalous dimension @xmath170 ) as that of plain 1 + 2 dimensional ads and also that , as expected , the btz counterpart to the hhi state has , as its boundary limit ( on , say , the right boundary cylinder ) a thermal state of that boundary theory , at the appropriate hawking temperature .",
    "moreover , and this was our main new result at a technical level , we have shown that , while these states of this theory have infinite entropy , in both bulk and boundary , if one imposes a suitable brick - wall cutoff in the bulk , labelled by the metrical distance , @xmath53 , from the brick wall to the horizon , then both bulk and boundary theories will have equal , finite , entropies , proportional to the ` area ' ( i.e.  circumference ) of the event horizon . moreover , by the way , we have pointed out , following t hooft and mukohyama and israel , that , if one assumes that a suitable number , @xmath52 , of our klein gordon fields will serve to model the thermodynamic behaviour of the basic ( matter and gravity ) fields which make up a consistent theory of quantum gravity ( in 1 + 2 dimensions , with cosmological constant ) then , in order for the entropy of both bulk and boundary to equal the , presumed physically correct , hawking value of one quarter of the ` area ' of the event horizon ( i.e.  @xmath373 ) , @xmath374 needs to be taken to be approximately 34 .",

    "some ( but not all ) of our tentative conclusions assume this hypothesis and this resolution to be correct .",
    "in particular , we point out that this resolution seems to suggest a radically different from usual understanding of the nature of maldacena holography ( namely as a one - way map from bulk to boundary rather than a bijection ) . in the sequel",
    ", we shall find it convenient ( despite our earlier terminological conventions in section [ sect : intro ] and note @xmath0[note : unfortunate]@xmath1 ) to adopt arnsdorf and smolin s terminology ` rehren dual ' to denote the bulk theory which corresponds to a given boundary cft according to rehren s algebraic holography .",
    "one of our tentative conclusions which does nt depend on our ` matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis ' ( although which survives in an interestingly modified form with it ) concerns the nature of the rehren dual of the boundary cft which arise in maldacena s ads / cft correspondence .",
    "finally , we shall also comment further on the arnsdorf - smolin puzzle in the light of our tentative conclusions @xmath0[note : smolinprovisos]@xmath1 .",
    "we begin , in the next subsection , by gathering together some , we think reasonable , extrapolations from what we have shown :      we adopt a number of working assumptions throughout the sequel : first : that the result which we found in the 1 + 2 dimensional case holds for schwarzschild ads ( with arbitrary mass @xmath129 and radius @xmath9 ) in arbitrary dimension 1+@xmath4 and for other quantum theories ( not just the klein - gordon field ) defined in terms of nets of local * -algebras on the fixed schwarzschild - ads background . in particular , we shall assume that , for such quantum theories on such bulk spacetimes , the boundary theory , defined by a suitable generalization of ( [ blim ] ) on the appropriate 1+(@xmath4 - 1 ) dimensional ( say right ) boundary cylinder will be locally the same boundary conformal quantum theory that one obtains on the boundary for the same bulk quantum theory on ads .",
    "moreover , we shall assume that the hhi state will go over to a thermal state at the appropriate hawking temperature on the boundary theory .",
    "we shall assume further that , if necessary with a suitable brick wall in the bulk to make it finite , the entropy of the induced state on the boundary will always equal the bulk entropy .",
    "turning to consider the reverse direction of boundary to bulk : second : it also seems reasonable to expect ( see @xmath0[note : expect]@xmath1 ) that , given our conformal generalized free field with anomalous dimension given by ( [ delta ] ) for some choice of @xmath4 and @xmath2 , defined on a 1+(@xmath4 - 1 ) dimensional cylinder of radius @xmath9 , then the bulk quantum theory corresponding to the covariant klein gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) for mass @xmath129 on the right schwarzschild wedge of the 1+@xmath4 dimensional schwarzschild - ads spacetime of mass @xmath129 and radius @xmath9 will be related to it by boundary limit holography .",
    "( for the prospects for it also being related according to a suitable extension of rehren s algebraic holography see note @xmath0[note : bhalgholo]@xmath1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we would expect a thermal state for any temperature , @xmath110 , on the former cft to go over to a thermal state at the same temperature on each of the latter , bulk right schwarzschild wedges ( as well , of course , as on all of plain ads ) .",
    "however , in view of the uniqueness results in @xcite and @xcite , for given @xmath129 and @xmath9 , we would only expect one of these bulk states to extend in a non - singular way from the right schwarzschild wedge to the full * -algebra for the full ( maximally extended ) schwarzschild - ads bulk  namely the one for which @xmath110 coincides with the hawking temperature .",
    "( and when it does extend , the extended state will be the hhi state . )",
    "we shall also assume that this second working assumption generalizes to an arbitrary boundary cft .",
    "i.e.  we shall assume that , given an arbitrary cft whose rehren dual is a given quantum theory in the bulk of plain ads , then , if defined on a 1 + ( @xmath4 - 1 ) dimensional cylinder of radius @xmath9 , it will be related by boundary limit holography to the _ same _ @xmath0[note : same]@xmath1 bulk theory defined on the right schwarzschild wedge of the 1+@xmath4 dimensional schwarzschild ads spacetime of arbitrary mass , @xmath129 , and radius @xmath9 .",
    "a thermal state at temperature , @xmath110 , of the cft on the boundary cylinder could then be seen as arising from the boundary limit of a thermal state at the same temperature of the same bulk theory .",
    "but we would only expect such a state to arise from a non - singular state on the * -algebra when the same theory is defined on the maximally extended schwarzschild ads with mass , @xmath129 , such that @xmath110 is the hawking temperature for that particular @xmath129 and @xmath9 .",
    "( and when it does extend , the extended state would again be the hhi state . )    with these working assumptions , we next remark that , in fixed background holography , the very fact that the same boundary theory ( say our conformal generalized free field with anomalous dimension @xmath5 on a 1+(@xmath4 - 1 ) dimensional cylinder of radius @xmath9 ) is related to more than one bulk theory ( i.e.  the klein gordon equation on 1+@xmath4 dimensional plain ads and also on the right schwarzschild wedge of schwarzschild ads for each value of @xmath129 ) is a feature that is not shared with ( presumably background independent ! ) mainstream maldacena ads / cft . in the latter theory",
    ", we expect , of course , that the different bulk geometries themselves arise from classical approximations to different states of the same bulk theory ( in particular a ground state and a thermal state at the relevant hawking temperature @xmath375 for each @xmath129 ) .",
    "this contrast is well - illustrated by the maldacena scenario involving an ads@xmath376 bulk , where @xcite at low temperatures , a thermal state on a cylinder of the boundary cft is believed to correspond to a state of the bulk theory @xmath0[note : double]@xmath1 which , in the large @xmath25/weak coupling limit consists of the relevant ( kaluza klein reduced ) supergravity theory on a bulk spacetime which is locally plain ads@xmath18 , while at high temperatures ( i.e.  above the relevant phase transition @xcite ) and in the same limit , it consists of the same supergravity theory , but now on a five dimensional schwarzschild - ads background with an appropriate mass , @xmath129 ; whereas , on the other hand , one can , presumably , ask about the fixed - background holography counterpart to thermal states of the boundary cft on the given radius-@xmath9 boundary cylinder at any temperature for bulk schwarzschild - ads backgrounds of any radius @xmath9 and any mass @xmath129 ( or for plain ads )  and these will constitue a one - parameter family ( i.e.  parametrized by @xmath129 ) of _ different _ fixed - background holographic relationships .      for definiteness , and also to make closer contact with @xcite ,",
    "let us take as our examplar of a quantum gravity theory the bulk ( string ) theory involved in the maldacena ads@xmath18 correspondence ( see note @xmath0[note : adscft]@xmath1 ) .",
    "it is reasonable and usual to suppose that a state of this theory which physically represents a ( stable ) quantum black hole in equilibrium with its thermal atmosphere will have an approximate description in terms of a classical 5-dimensional schwarzschild ads spacetime together with a thermal atmosphere consisting of the fields which result from a kaluza klein reduction of the relevant supergravity theory on the 5 dimensional schwarzschild ads times @xmath377  defined on ( say ) the right schwarzschild wedge @xmath0[note : double]@xmath1 .",
    "we recall from section [ sect : intro ] that the mukohyama - israel puzzle is the puzzle as to how it comes about that the entropy of this state can be calculated ",
    "see again note @xmath0[note : adscft]@xmath1  in two seemingly quite different ways : on the one hand , it can be calculated as the gravitational entropy , i.e.  one quarter of the area of the event horizon ( divided by the appropriate string theory formula for newton s constant ) of the classical black hole background , while , on the other hand , it can presumably also be calculated as the entropy of the thermal atmosphere  the latter calculation presumably requiring a suitable brick wall cutoff in order to compensate for a presumed flaw in the description of the thermal atmosphere in terms of quantum fields on a fixed curved spacetime ( which will , again presumably , get repaired in a more correct quantum gravitational description  [ but ] see subsection [ subsect : dual ] below ) .",
    "the connection with the arnsdorf - smolin puzzle ( see @xcite and section [ sect : intro ] ) is that there are now two seemingly quite different ways of arguing that the entropy of the quantum black hole state is equal to the entropy of the boundary cft which arises in the ads@xmath18 version of ads / cft .",
    "firstly , thinking of the entropy of the state as given by the former gravitational entropy calculation , we can argue that this must be equal to the entropy of the boundary cft using maldacena holography . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume that the ( brick wall modified ) thermal atmosphere is related to the same boundary cft by fixed background holography , then , with our working assumptions , thinking of the entropy of our state as the entropy of this thermal atmosphere , we can argue that this must be equal to the entropy of the boundary cft but , this time , the argument for the equality is based on fixed background holography .    admittedly , the above remarks , as they stand , amount to just an interesting connection between our two puzzles rather than a resolution of either of them .",
    "however , this connection would seem to suggest one interesting conclusion : namely , that the bulk theory which is related to our boundary cft by boundary limit holography must at least be ` something like ' our thermal atmosphere ",
    "i.e.  the ( kaluza klein reduction of ) our supergravity theory on the right schwarzschild wedge .",
    "and , with our ( generalization of our ) second working assumption , this then implies that , in _ plain _ ads , the rehren dual to our boundary cft must be ` something like ' the same supergravity theory . this would seem to support one of the tentative possible resolutions of their paradox raised by arnsdorf and smolin themselves ( see the paragraph labelled ` m1 ' on page 7 of @xcite where they write that , `` in the [ large @xmath25 and ] @xmath378 limit , maldacena holography and the rehren duality could coincide '' ) .",
    "see however subsection [ subsect : dual ] below where we will offer a clarification of this and , in particular , argue for a certain clarification of the phrase ` something like ' here .      in a series of articles @xcite dating back to 1998 (",
    "see especially end notes ( i)-(v ) , in @xcite ) one of us ( bsk ) proposed a physical interpretation of quantum gravity which , while seemingly consistent with conservative principles ",
    "it assumes quantum gravity is a conventional quantum theory with a unitary time evolution  entails a radically different from usual picture of quantum black holes .",
    "the main idea is to posit that any closed quantum gravitational system ( be it one that contains a black hole or otherwise ) is described by an ( ever pure and unitarily evolving ) pure state ( here , we take ` pure state ' to be synonymous with ` vector state ' ) , @xmath379 on a total hilbert space , @xmath380 which is a tensor product of a gravity hilbert space , @xmath381 , and a matter hilbert space @xmath382 .",
    "however , rather than identifying its physical entropy with the von neumann entropy of the total state ( which would of course be ever zero for a total pure state ) it is proposed to identify it with the total state s matter - gravity entanglement entropy .",
    "this can perfectly well be non - zero , and increasing with time , even though the total state is assumed to be pure and to evolve unitarily .",
    "it thereby seems to offer a simple and attractive solution to the information loss puzzle @xcite .    as explained in end notes ( i ) and",
    "( iii ) in @xcite this ` matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis ' also seems to offer a natural resolution to , what we have called in the present paper , the mukohyama - israel puzzle . for , in a vector state , the entanglement entropy of a bipartite system must , by an easy theorem , be both the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator on the first system and equally the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator on the second system .",
    "but , applying this theorem to our pure entangled state of matter - gravity , our physical entropy must be the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator of the gravitational field , which is plausibly the same thing as the gravitational entropy ( i.e.  one quarter of the area of the event horizon ) ; but it must also be the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator of the matter field which is plausibly ( close to  see below ) the same thing as the state of the ( perhaps brick wall modified ) thermal atmosphere in a quantum field theory in curved spacetime description .    as far as the operators of the quantum gravity theory are concerned , these presumably are described by a total * -algebra which is a tensor product of a gravity * -algebra , @xmath383 , and a matter * -algebra , @xmath384 ( the full tensor product being represented on @xmath380 ) . combining all this with the conclusions of the previous subsection , we seem to be led to the following view as to the nature of maldacena holography in which , rather than being a bijection between the total bulk theory and the boundary cft :    _ maldacena holography ( say in its ads@xmath18 version ) is a one - way mapping from bulk to boundary in which the boundary cft is identified with ( and arises as a suitable boundary limit of ) bulk operators of form @xmath385 ( @xmath386 here denoting the identity operator on the gravity hilbert space ) . _    _ moreover , the proper understanding of the well - established ( see section [ sect : intro ] and note @xmath0[note : adscft]@xmath1 ) equality between the bulk gravitational entropy and the boundary cft entropy in the case of a thermal state on the 1 + 3 dimensional boundary cylinder ( at a temperature above the witten phase transition temperature ) is that the total bulk state ( as usual , approximately described by the relevant classical schwarzschild - ads background with the relevant kaluza klein - reduced supergravity fields / strings propagating on it ) is a _ pure _ total state , @xmath379 , of matter - gravity , entangled in just such a way that the reduced density operators ( i.e.  of @xmath387 ) on each of @xmath382 and @xmath381 are each separately ( approximately ) thermal at the relevant hawking temperature . when we say that the entropies of bulk and boundary are equal , what is really happening is that the von neumann entropy of the ( mixed ) boundary thermal density operator ( equals the von - neumann entropy of the reduced density operator on @xmath382 which ) equals the matter - gravity entanglement entropy of the ( pure ! ) bulk state . _",
    "these italicised statements seem quite heretical although we are unaware of any decisive evidence against them .",
    "we note , in this regard , that arnsdorf and smolin have argued in @xcite that it may well be consistent with what is known ( was known as of mid 2001 ) about maldacena holography that it might just be a one - way map from bulk to boundary , rather than a bijection ( see also a similar point by giddings , reiterated in his recent paper @xcite ) ; and such a result , would , as they themselves point out , go at least part of the way towards resolving their paradox . in any case , even if there may turn out to be evidence against it , such evidence should , we feel , be weighed against the virtue of the above view that it would seem to fit better with the hope that string theory can be part of the solution to the information loss puzzle than the conventional view about the interpretation of string theory ( where one adopts the conventional picture of black hole equilibrium states as non - pure states  a picture which seems to be at odds with any such resolution ) .",
    "of course , for these italicized statements to be less than vague , we would need to specify what might be meant by the ` matter - gravity split ' in a string - theory context .",
    "we have to admit that we presently do not have a clear answer to this but would make the following remarks : first ( cf . especially note ( ii ) in @xcite ) the splitting between matter and gravity is only expected to be an approximate notion which only makes sense ( well ) below the planck energy . secondly , in a more physically realistic string theory ( where , say there are compact ` extra ' dimensions which are small ) then we can , of course , identify , at low energies , in a field - theoretic approximation involving a kaluza - klein reduced supergravity theory etc .",
    ", what are photons , electrons etc .",
    "( i.e.  matter ) and what are gravitons ( gravity ) etc .",
    "thirdly , as susskind @xcite has argued , we expect a black hole to correspond in the weak string - coupling limit to states of very long strings so it seems plausible that such states of very long strings should get lumped together as part of the gravitational field .",
    "finally , it is tempting to wonder if one can , naively , make the identification : _ open strings _ @xmath388 _ matter _ ; _ closed strings _ @xmath388 _ gravity_.",
    "but it is then not clear how this would fit with our above remark about long strings .",
    "we should also remark that there may be more than one way of realizing a splitting between closed and open strings in the bulk .",
    "in fact , quite aside from the fact that such a splitting can of course anyway only make sense in an approximate way at weak string coupling , there may also possibly be alternative dual ( now really in the sense of equivalent ! ) descriptions of the bulk theory in which the parts of the theory which are identified as closed - string and open - string sectors are different .",
    "for example , iy park @xcite has argued for a dual ( i.e. equivalent ) description of the bulk theory in which , rather than a type iib theory , it is a theory with open strings ( some with fully neumann boundary condistions ) as well as closed strings and d - branes .    as a final remark on this issue : it may be that what we need to do is turn things around and simply _ define _ @xmath384 to be the rehren dual ( see subsection [ subsect : dual ] ) of the * -algebra of the maldacena boundary cft .",
    "we next make a couple of further comments on the scenario proposed in our italicised statements above .",
    "first , another way of expressing things is that the pure vector state , @xmath379 , in the total hilbert space @xmath380 which describes the bulk matter - gravity equilibrium _ purifies _ the thermal density operator on @xmath382 ( cf .",
    "secondly , on our scenario , an arbitrary element of @xmath380 will be approximated as closely as one likes by acting on @xmath379 with operators of the form @xmath385  which is identified with the * -algebra of operators of the boundary cft .",
    "so in this sense , it would still be correct to say ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that _ the bulk ( string theory ) hilbert space is the same as the boundary cft hilbert space_. cf .",
    "the analogy with the ` right - wedge reeh schlieder property ' which we point out in note @xmath0[note : double]@xmath1 .",
    "another way of saying this is that the total hilbert space can be equated with the gns hilbert space ( see section [ sect : prelim ] ) for the ( algebraic ) state @xmath389 on @xmath384 .",
    "in other terminology , it is the hilbert space in the sense of thermofield dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , at zero temperature ( i.e.  for the ground state on the boundary cft  now on minkowski space ) when the bulk is plain ads this will no longer be the case .",
    "in fact , in line with our ` matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis ' and the expectations above , we would expect the total ground state to be ( approximately ) a tensor product ( i.e.  an unentangled state ) of a gravity ground state and a matter ground state and therefore its entropy ( as we define it ) will be zero  which is of course in line with the conventional expectation .",
    "lastly , in the paper @xcite by giddings which we cited in a parenthetical remark above , it is speculated that the bulk - to - boundary mapping may be such that the boundary theory only captures an `` appropriately coarse - grained '' description of bulk physics .",
    "we remark that our proposal in our italicized statement above might perhaps be regarded as a concrete implementation of this idea .",
    "after all , the process of taking a partial trace ( in our proposal , over gravity so as to obtain the reduced density operator of matter in the bulk which will then be equivalent to the thermal state of the boundary cft ) can be regarded as a particular sort of quantum counterpart to classical coarse - graining  a sort which in our context ( in particular , because we suppose the bulk to be in a pure state ) is , as we indicated above , consistent with the resolution to the information loss puzzle proposed in @xcite .      finally , we return to our tentative conclusion , in subsection [ subsect : mi / asconnection ] , that the rehren dual of the maldacena boundary cft must at least be ` something like ' our thermal atmosphere ",
    "i.e.  our ( kaluza klein reduction of ) our supergravity theory on our right schwarzschild wedge .",
    "first of all , we recall that rehren pointed out in @xcite that the large @xmath25 limit of the maldacena cft is not itself a quantum field theory  and it is of course strictly only this large @xmath25 limit which ( at fixed t hooft coupling ) is believed to correspond to classical supergravity .",
    "so the question we ask ourselves is : what is the rehren dual of the maldacena cft at large but finite @xmath25 ?",
    "what we would seem to learn from our results ( with the extrapolations and working assumptions we made in subsection [ subsect : working ] ) is that _ this can not be an ordinary quantum field theory _ !",
    "after all , if it were an ordinary quantum field theory , it would presumably have a formally infinite entropy requiring a brick wall to be made finite .",
    "and yet the maldacena cft ( unlike e.g.  the conformal generalized free field whose rehren dual is the klein gordon equation ) _ is _ presumably an ordinary quantum field theory and therefore is expected to have a finite entropy density and hence a finite total entropy when defined on a cylinder , _ without _ the need for any brick wall in the bulk ! as to what its rehren dual could be , it would seem reasonable to suggest that the phrase ` something like our thermal atmosphere ' should , in the light of this , be ( partially ) clarified in the following way :    _ whatever the rehren dual of the maldacena cft ( i.e.  of @xmath390 supersymmetric yang mills theory ) may be , for fixed @xmath25 and at finite yang - mills coupling constant @xmath391 , in the limit @xmath392 , it is something like the ( kaluza klein reduction of ) the bulk string theory of ads@xmath393 in the limit of zero string coupling @xmath394 ( but at finite string length @xmath30 ) . _    part of our rationale for saying this is that , at zero @xmath391 ( which corresponds  see note @xmath0[note : adscft]@xmath1  to zero @xmath395 ) the string theory will be a theory which makes sense on a fixed background .",
    "another part is that we suppose that ( such a limit of ) a string theory will have a better chance than a quantum field theory of not needing a brick wall in order to have a finite entropy .",
    "this ( still partly vague ) conclusion did not depend on the ` matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis ' of @xcite .",
    "however , on that hypothesis , it would be natural to add the further clarification that it is in fact ` something like the _ matter sector _ of the ( kaluza klein reduction of ) the bulk string theory ' .",
    "( if / when that can be given a clear meaning . )    in support of either of these tentative conclusions ( i.e.  with or without the above further clarification ) we recall first that rehren himself has suggested ( in @xcite ) that the rehren dual of the maldacena cft may well involve strings . also there is work ( e.g.  by dimock @xcite ) suggesting that it will be possible to incorporate ( at least free , open ) string field theory into the framework of nets of local * -algebras .",
    "all these tentative conclusions are , of course , more or less speculative .",
    "but , assuming they are on the right track , they would seem to go at least some of the way towards a possible resolution of the arnsdorf - smolin puzzle .",
    "the puzzle will probably only be fully resolved when we have a satisfactory background - independent formulation of string theory , and if and when we have a clearer understanding of the nature of the rehren dual of the maldacena boundary cft .",
    "such a clearer understanding of the rehren dual would , on our matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis , as we remarked above , also presumably clarify how the matter - gravity split should be defined in the bulk string theory .",

    "but , already in euclidean quantum gravity ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , it seems not to be meaningful , for a given cylinder , to regard it as a ` right cylinder ' and to assume the existence of a left wedge and a left cylinder .",
    "( note that this point is unrelated to the ` single exterior black holes ' considered by louko and marolf @xcite and by maldacena @xcite . ) with our ` matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis ' ( discussed in subsection [ subsect : matgrav ] ) one might say , indeed , that the role which would be played by the left wedge is , in a sense , taken over by the quantum gravitational field . in particular , our expectation ( see subsection [ subsect : matgrav ] ) that the vector state , @xmath379 in @xmath380 which represents the equilibrium involving our ads black hole and its thermal atmosphere ` purifies ' our thermal density operator on @xmath382 is analogous to the way in which the double - wedge hilbert space purifies the thermal density operator for the right wedge in a quantum field theory in curved spacetime context .",
    "similarly our expectation , in subsection [ subsect : matgrav ] , that an arbitrary vector in @xmath380 can be arbitrarily closely approximated by vectors obtained by acting with elements of @xmath524 on @xmath379 is analogous to the ` reeh schlieder property ' of the right wedge algebra in the fixed background context .",

    "<S> we discuss the relationship between the bulk - boundary correspondence in rehren s algebraic holography ( and in other ` fixed - background ' , qft - based , approaches to holography ) and in mainstream string - theoretic ` maldacena ads / cft ' . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we contrast the understanding of black - hole entropy from the point of view of qft in curved spacetime  in the framework of t hooft s ` brick wall ' model  with the understanding based on maldacena ads / cft . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the brick - wall modification of a klein gordon field in the hartle - hawking - israel state on 1 + 2 dimensional schwarzschild ads ( btz ) has a well - defined boundary limit with the same temperature and entropy as the brick - wall - modified bulk theory . </S>",
    "<S> one of our main purposes is to point out a close connection , for general ads / cft situations , between the puzzle raised by arnsdorf and smolin regarding the relationship between rehren s algebraic holography and mainstream ads / cft and the puzzle embodied in the ` correspondence principle ' proposed by mukohyama and israel in their work on the brick - wall approach to black hole entropy . </S>",
    "<S> working on the assumption that similar results will hold for bulk qft other than the klein gordon field and for schwarzschild ads in other dimensions , and recalling the first author s proposed resolution to the mukohyama - israel puzzle based on his ` matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis ' , we argue that , in maldacena ads / cft , the algebra of the boundary cft is isomorphic only to a proper subalgebra of the bulk algebra , albeit ( at non - zero temperature ) the ( gns ) hilbert spaces of bulk and boundary theories are still the ` same '  the total bulk state being pure , while the boundary state is mixed ( thermal ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue from the finiteness of its boundary ( and hence , on our assumptions , also bulk ) entropy at finite temperature , that the rehren dual of the maldacena boundary cft can not itself be a qft and must , instead , presumably be something like a string theory . </S>"
