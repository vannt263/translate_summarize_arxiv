    "recently , exotic light nuclear systems involving a @xmath18 ( @xmath11 and @xmath19 ) as a constituent have been predicted based on phenomenologically constructed @xmath9 interactions @xcite .",
    "the predicted bound states in @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath11@xmath22be with large binding energies lie below the @xmath23 emission threshold , and thus are expected to have relatively narrow decay widths . because of the strong @xmath9 attraction they acquire enormously high nucleon densities , @xmath24 @xmath25 , about 3 times the normal nuclear density @xmath26 @xmath25 .",
    "such compact nuclear systems , which can be called ",
    "@xmath18 nuclear clusters \" ( _ knc _ ) , are often those formed with non - existing nuclei . the basic ingredient for this new family of nuclear states is the @xmath27 state , which is identified to the known @xmath28 resonance ( hereafter , expressed as @xmath12 ) in the @xmath29 channel with a binding energy of @xmath30 = 27 mev and a width of @xmath31 = 40 mev @xcite . since the @xmath28 resonance is largely populated in the @xmath32 channel @xcite .",
    "it is very likely to be the @xmath33 state .",
    "this is also supported by the large formation of @xmath12 in the @xmath11 absorption at rest on @xmath34he @xcite and also in nuclear emulsion @xcite ,    the lightest system following this  @xmath1 ansatz \" is @xmath4 ( and its isospin partner @xmath35 ) , which was predicted to exist with @xmath5 mev/@xmath6 , @xmath30 = 48 mev and @xmath31 = 61 mev @xcite .",
    "this species , which can be called _ kaonic dibaryon _ or _ nuclear kaonic hydrogen molecule _ , results from a fusion of @xmath12 and @xmath16 , namely , @xmath12 as a bound state of @xmath36  dissolves \" into a @xmath18 bound state , @xmath0 , as @xmath37 where @xmath12 may or may not keep its original structure .",
    "the situation resembles the diatomic molecule case , where the hydrogen atom ( h = @xmath38 ) can not exists as it is when it merges with a proton into a @xmath16-@xmath39-@xmath16 ( h@xmath40 ) molecule .",
    "the hydrogen atom , when implanted into a solid , becomes  hydrogen in solids \" , where the hydrogen takes various forms , such as deep / shallow donors and ionized states .",
    "it is extremely interesting to ask to what extent the @xmath12 keeps its identity in nuclear systems .",
    "this question is related to the proposal that the @xmath12 plays a role as a doorway to form @xmath18 bound states @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we first study the @xmath0 composite as a very unique three - body system in which an exotic particle ( @xmath11 ) plays an unusually peculiar role in the three - body dynamics through the very strong attractive interaction in @xmath36 .",
    "the study was carried out by solving this three - body system exactly in a variational method , called  amalgamation of two - body correlations into multiple scattering process ( atms ) \" @xcite , which is a method to construct a realistic wave function of few - body system with correlation functions of each constituent pairs on the basis of watson s multiple scattering theory @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions are variationally determined from a given hamiltonian by using euler - lagrange s equation .",
    "we used the elementary @xmath9 and @xmath10 interactions deduced semi - empirically to obtain not only the binding energy and width but also the spatial and momentum distributions of the individual particles .",
    "we justify our three - body calculations by showing that the @xmath9 complex potential , which is transformed from coupled - channel interactions , has very little energy dependence .",
    "furthermore , we show that the result remains unchanged , even when we allow the @xmath41 and @xmath10 interactions to vary in a wide range , as long as they reproduce the energy and width of @xmath1 .",
    "thus we are led to a robust consequence that the predicted @xmath0 is a compact nuclear system with a binding energy around 50 mev and a rms @xmath42 distance of 1.9 fm . through this study",
    "we have found that the @xmath3 unit ( quasi-@xmath12 ) behaves like an atomic unit in a  molecule \" of @xmath0 , similar to the mechanism of the heitler - london scheme @xcite .",
    "namely , a super strong nuclear force is caused by a migrating real @xmath18 meson , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this will be the central subject of section [ sec : structure ] .",
    "the decay property of @xmath4 has been studied theoretically in @xcite , which showed that , in addition to the dominant decay process to @xmath43 , the partial decay rate to @xmath44 is around 20 mev .",
    "recently , faddeev calculations have been carried out to obtain the pole of @xmath4 by shevchenko _",
    "_ @xcite and by ikeda and sato @xcite .",
    "their pole values are close to our original result .    some indications for @xmath4",
    "were reported in the invariant - mass spectrum of @xmath45 .",
    "an old propane bubble chamber experiment with several gev proton and neutron beams showed a peak at @xmath46 mev/@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a more recent experiment of finuda at daphne on stopped-@xmath11 reactions on light nuclei revealed a peak at @xmath47 mev/@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this result was interpreted by the experimental group as indicating a bound @xmath4 state with @xmath48 mev , whereas two different theoretical arguments have been published @xcite .",
    "this issue has to wait for further confirmation by future experiments .",
    "it is important to produce various @xmath18 clusters by different nuclear reactions and thereby to examine their structure , formation and decay properties .",
    "a method to determine the sizes of the @xmath18 clusters via the momentum correlation of decay particles has been proposed @xcite .    in the second part of the present paper we study the possibility to make use of the elementary process , @xmath49[eq : pp ]",
    "in which @xmath12 and @xmath16 proceed to @xmath0 . since the momentum transfer in this associated production of @xmath12 is very large ( @xmath50 1.6 gev/@xmath15 )",
    ", one would expect that the formation cross section of @xmath0 must be very small .",
    "this process resembles the hypernuclear production process , @xmath51(p , k^+)^{a+1}_{\\lambda}[z]$ ] , on a nuclear target , the cross section of which was evaluated by shinmura _",
    "@xcite to be @xmath52 of the elementary @xmath53 production cross section , even when a short - range correlation is taken into account . on the other hand , with a naive coalescence mechanism one obtains a sticking probability of the order of 0.1 - 1.0 % because the internal momentum of the @xmath18 clusters is very large @xcite .",
    "still , most of primarily produced @xmath12 are expected to escape , and the quasi - free process dominates .",
    "we have studied this proton - induced associated production process more realistically , and found a surprisingly large production cross section by a unique mechanism , as described in section [ sec : pp - reaction ] .",
    "its preliminary description is seen in @xcite in connection with an experiment proposal at gsi using the fopi detector @xcite .",
    "short communications of the present results are also seen in ref .",
    "we start from the ansatz that the @xmath1 resonance state is the @xmath54 1s bound state of @xmath41 .",
    "through the main part of this paper we employ the  classical \" experimental values for the binding energy and width @xcite , @xmath55[eq : lambda * ] later , in subsection [ subsec : beyond ] , we will make a fine tuning , considering recent values , @xmath56 mev and @xmath57 mev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 data , [ eq : lambda * ] , combined with the kaonic hydrogen shift @xcite ( yielding @xmath58 ) and martin s @xmath41 scattering lengths ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) @xcite , @xmath61 were used in a coupled - channel calculation to deduce the @xmath41 interactions of the following forms @xcite @xmath62 , \\\\ v_{\\bar{k } n , \\pi \\sigma } ^i & = & v_{c_1 } \\ , { \\rm exp}[-(r / b)^2 ] , \\\\ v_{\\bar{k } n , \\pi \\lambda } ^i & = & v_{c_2 } \\ , { \\rm exp}[-(r / b)^2 ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 mev , @xmath65 mev , @xmath66 = none , @xmath67 mev , @xmath68 mev , @xmath69 mev .",
    "the two interactions , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , are taken to be vanishing to simply reduce the number of parameters .",
    "this is justified because they are almost irrelevant in describing the @xmath18  bound states .",
    "the above coupled - channel interactions were used to derive equivalent single - channel @xmath41 potentials with imaginary parts in energy - independent forms , which is an appropriate way to obtain the _ decaying state _ of kapur - peierls @xcite as discussed below .",

    "now , let us discuss the energy dependence of the single - channel complex @xmath41 potential .",

    "a virtual state sometimes appears on the @xmath87 unphysical sheet , which gives a serious energy dependence of @xmath102 , when used to obtain the `` pole state '' of @xmath4 in three - body faddeev calculations @xcite .",
    "however , one should notice that experimental observation is done _ not for the `` pole state '' but for the `` decaying state '' _ , as understood from the open - channel asymptotic behavior of green s function of morimatsu - yazaki @xcite describing the process of @xmath4 production reactions .",
