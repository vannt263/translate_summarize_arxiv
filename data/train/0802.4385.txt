    "flexibility plays a key role in determining the physical properties of framework materials . in many oxide - containing frameworks , for example , the underconstraint of linear cation  oxygen  cation ( m  o  m ) linkages",
    "means that the m  o  m angle is especially sensitive to changes in temperature , pressure and composition . a direct consequence of this underconstraint is the rich series of polyhedral - tilting transitions known to pervade the broad and technologically - important families of perovskite materials @xcite and silicate frameworks @xcite .",
    "a similar example is the well - known negative thermal expansion ( nte ) material zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 , where the same local flexibility of m  o  m linkages is implicated in a number of unusual physical properties : nte itself @xcite , elastic constant softening under pressure @xcite , and pressure - induced amorphisation @xcite .",
    "it is becoming increasingly evident that the two - atom metal  cyanide  metal ( m  cn ",
    "m ) linkages found in many transition metal cyanides @xcite can produce a similar , and often more extreme , array of unusual physical behaviour . because the cyanide molecule is able to translate as an independent unit , not only is the linkage especially flexible but much of the correlation between displacement patterns around neighbouring m centres is lost @xcite .",
    "what this means is that properties such as nte appear to be inherently more common amongst cyanides than amongst oxide - containing frameworks , and also the magnitude of these effects can be much larger @xcite .",
    "for example , isotropic nte behaviour in the zn@xmath5cd@xmath6(cn)@xmath3 family is more than twice as strong , and in the case of single - network cd(cn)@xmath3 more than three times as strong , as that in zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the concept of increasing framework flexibility  and hence the likelihood and extent of unusual physical behaviour  by employing linear structural motifs of increasing length has led us recently to discover colossal positive and negative thermal expansion in ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the covalent framework structure of this material , discussed in more detail below , is assembled from co ",
    "ag  nc  co linkages , so that the transition metal centres are now connected by linear chains containing five atoms .",
    "the framework lattice produced is so flexible that it can adopt a wide variety of geometries with essentially no difference in lattice enthalpy .",
    "this serves to amplify the thermodynamic role of low - energy bonding interactions , in this case the dispersion - like `` argentophilic '' interactions between neighbouring ag@xmath2ag pairs .",
    "the net effect is that the lattice expands in some directions at a rate typical of those observed in van - der - waals solids ( _ e.g. _  xe @xcite ) and this expansion is coupled via flexing of the framework lattice to an equally strong nte effect along a perpendicular direction : the coefficients of thermal expansion , @xmath7 , were found to be roughly linear and equal to @xmath8mk@xmath9 ( 1mk@xmath10k@xmath9 ) over much of the temperature range 16500k .",
    "it is an interesting and , as yet , unresolved issue as to how these large changes in framework geometry are accommodated at the atomic scale .",
    "the separations between some neighbouring pairs of atoms must be affected just as strongly by temperature as the overall lattice dimensions , and the important question is how these changes can be correlated throughout the crystal lattice with such a low energy penalty .",
    "this is essentially a _ local structure _ problem , and as such one needs to employ experimental techniques capable of probing local correlations in order to address these issues . in previous studies of flexible materials , nte phases and other disordered systems ,",
    "we have seen that neutron total scattering can be an invaluable tool when studying local structure and dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed the technique is ideally suited to thermal expansion studies because it probes at once both average and local structure , and so can be used to produce atomic - level descriptions of the crystal structure that are entirely consistent with the known changes in average structure .    in this paper",
    ", we use a combination of neutron total scattering and reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) analysis @xcite to study local structure in ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 over the temperature range 10300k .",
    "our interest is in understanding how the local arrangements of atoms in the material and their correlated behaviour vary as a function of temperature , with particular emphasis on : ( i ) thermal changes in the geometry of the co  cn  ag ",
    "co linkages , ( ii ) the extent to which transverse vibrational motion of these linkages helps moderate expansion along the @xmath11 crystal axes , ( iii ) the rigidity ( or otherwise ) of [ coc@xmath1 coordination octahedra , and hence whether so - called rigid unit modes ( rums @xcite ) play an important role in the lattice dynamics , and ( iv ) evidence for the anharmonicity of ag@xmath2ag interactions .",
    "our paper begins with a review of the crystal structure of ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 and its thermal expansion behaviour .",
    "we also include a brief discussion regarding bonding in the material , based largely on a parallel density functional theory ( dft ) investigation by one of our groups @xcite .",
    "section [ methods ] then describes the various experimental and computational methods used in our study , including our methods of overcoming the severe anisotropic peak broadening effects observed in low - temperature diffraction patterns .",
    "our experimental results and discussion are given in section [ results ] , where we report the bond length and bond angle distributions extracted from our total scattering data , together with the results of both real- and reciprocal - space analyses of correlated behaviour in our rmc configurations .",
    "the implications of these experimental and computational results are discussed with particular reference to our previous study of colossal thermal expansion behaviour in ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the first crystallographic study of ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 was reported in 1967 by ludi and co - workers @xcite , but the validity of the structural model proposed in this paper was questioned in a subsequent re - evaluation by pauling and pauling @xcite .",
    "the paulings alternative solution , which was confirmed shortly afterwards @xcite and appears consistent with modern x - ray and neutron diffraction data @xcite , describes a three - dimensional framework assembled from co ",
    "ag  nc  co linkages .",
    "each co@xmath12 centre is connected to six other co atoms via these linkages , forming an extended covalent framework with a cubic network topology analogous to that of the prussian blues .",
    "the `` cube edges '' of the framework  namely the co  cn  ag  nc  co linkages  are so long ( @xmath13 ) that two additional , identical framework lattices can be accommodated within the open cavities of the first , producing the triply - interpenetrating motif illustrated in fig .",

    "( c ) elongation of the cubic nets along the trigonal axis produces a layered structure in which triangular arrays of hexacyanocobaltate anions ( filled polyhedra ) alternate with ag - containing kagome nets . ]",
    "threefold interpenetration of this type distinguishes one of the cube body diagonals from the remaining three , removing all but one of the original threefold axes of the cubic network .",
    "consequently the highest compatible crystal symmetry is not a cubic space group , but rather the experimentally - observed trigonal group @xmath14 , with the @xmath15 axis oriented parallel to the unique cube body diagonal .",
    "consequently there is no symmetry constraint to prevent distortion of the cubic networks along the trigonal axis , and indeed at room temperature one observes a co@xmath2co@xmath2co `` cube '' angle of 74.98@xmath16 @xcite .",

    "the negative charge of the transition - metal - cyanide framework is counterbalanced by the inclusion of alkali earth cations within the framework cavities ( the inclusion being responsible for the lower symmetry ) .    amongst all these structurally - related materials , ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 is unique in terms of the orientation of the cyanide ions : the @xmath22 centres are coordinated by the n atoms of the cyanide groups .",

    "the different arrangement seen here may be forced by the coordinatively - inert [ co(cn)@xmath1@xmath18 salt from which the material is prepared @xcite . perhaps a synthetic route involving co@xmath12 and [ ag(cn)@xmath3]@xmath23 ions would yield the `` expected '' co[ag(cn)@xmath3]@xmath0 isomer ; however , dft calculations suggest that the co  cn ",
    "ag bonding arrangement is in fact thermodynamically favoured @xcite .",
    "a second point of interest , and one that is discussed in more detail below , is the relatively short nearest - neighbour ag@xmath2ag distances : the separation at room temperature is approximately 3.5 , which is only marginally greater than the van der waals limit ( 3.4  @xcite ) , despite the coulombic repulsion .",
    "this close approach between @xmath22 centres is indicative of @xmath24 `` metallophilic '' interactions @xcite .",
    "our previous neutron scattering analysis @xcite showed that anharmonicity of these interactions is implicated in the unusual thermal expansion behaviour of the material .",
    "similarly , our separate dft study @xcite showed the interactions also help `` soften '' the material by flattening the potential energy surface , facilitating the large changes in cell dimensions observed experimentally .",
    "the crystal symmetry imposes a number of constraints on the framework geometry that restrict how it can respond to changes in temerapture .",
    "these can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the co atoms ( which are all equivalent ) have @xmath25 point symmetry , so that each [ coc@xmath1 coordination octahedron may distort along the trigonal axis , but all co ",
    "c bonds are equivalent and there are only three internal c  co  c angles : @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   the ag atoms ( which also are equivalent ) are coplanar ; with a single nearest - neighbour ag distance and all nearest - neighbour ag  ag ",
    "ag angles equal to @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath28 .",
    "the ag site has @xmath31 point symmetry ; consequently , all atoms within a given co ",
    "co linkage are coplanar , the n  ag ",
    "n angle is equal to 180@xmath16 and all cyanide groups are equivalent .",
    "our primary interest in ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 has been its highly unusual thermal expansion behaviour .",
    "when heated , the crystal lattice responds by expanding remarkably quickly along the @xmath32 and @xmath33 crystal axes , while contracting equally strongly along the @xmath34 ( trigonal ) axis . in absolute terms ,",
    "x - ray diffraction data show the unit cell parameters to vary between extremes of @xmath35  at 16k and @xmath36  at 496k @xcite . over much of this temperature range ,",
    "the coefficients of thermal expansion are found to be essentially constant and equal to @xmath37mk@xmath9 and @xmath38mk@xmath9 ; these values correspond to a volume coefficient of thermal expansion of @xmath39mk@xmath9 and an equivalent isotropic expansion of @xmath40mk@xmath9 .    for the vast majority of useable materials , uniaxial thermal expansivities lie in the range @xmath41mk@xmath9 @xcite , and",
    "so the behaviour exhibited by ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 is really rather exceptional . indeed",
    "the positive thermal expansion ( pte ) effect is similar in magnitude to that of the most weakly bound solids ( _ e.g. _  xe @xcite ) , while the nte effect along @xmath34 is unprecedented for a crystalline material .",
    "the unusual behaviour of ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 appears to be intimately related to the flexibility of its framework lattice . in particular",
    ", the coupling between expansion along @xmath32 and contraction along @xmath34 means the overall behaviour can be interpreted as a variation of the co@xmath2co@xmath2co `` cube '' angle [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] . because any such variation does not significantly affect the strongest bonding interactions  namely those along the co ",
    "cn  ag  nc ",
    "co linkages  this process can occur with minimal cost in lattice enthalpy .",
    "what this means is that the absolute value of the co@xmath2co@xmath2co angle at any given temperature ( and hence the absolute unit cell dimensions ) is essentially determined only by the weak ag@xmath2ag interactions that occur _ between _ interpenetrated networks ( see below ) .",
    "as for all bridging transition - metal cyanides , one expects some degree of covalency in the co@xmath42(cn)@xmath23 and ag@xmath43(nc)@xmath23 interactions .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the results of dft calculations @xcite , which give mulliken bond orders ( overlap populations ) of 0.25 ( co  c ) , 1.80 ( c  n ) and 0.34 ( ag  n ) @xcite .",
    "the difference in co  c and ag ",
    "n bond orders reflects the low electron density near the co centre : the co atom has a relatively high nominal charge , and at the same time the cyanide ligand is polarised such that the c atom is more electron - poor than the n atom .",
    "the same dft calculations give mulliken charges of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which suggest there exists a substantial degree of charge transfer from the cyanide ligands to the cobalt atoms .",
    "the covalency reflected in these dft results is responsible for strengthening the bonding along the cube `` edges '' of the framework  the co ",
    "co linkages  and hence the coupling between thermal expansion behaviour along the @xmath32 and @xmath34 axes .",
    "it will also mean that deformation of the transition metal coordination geometries will carry a higher energy penalty than would otherwise be the case . in terms of the lattice dynamics",
    ", this would see phonon modes that preserve these coordination geometries ( namely the rums ) emerge as some of the lowest - energy lattice vibrations .",
    "our recent structural investigation suggested that the only significant bonding interactions _ between _ interpenetrated frameworks are dispersion - like forces between neighbouring ag atoms @xcite . rather than involving shared electrons , these `` argentophilic '' bonds arise from multipolar interactions between excited electronic states of the @xmath22 centres .",
    "as such , the interactions are not explicitly taken into account at the dft level ; indeed dft gives the anticipated ag@xmath2ag bond order of 0.0 ( reflecting the absence of any covalency ) , together with a separation closer to that expected in the absence of any attractive terms @xcite .",
    "in fact the large difference between dft and experimental cell parameters is actually strong evidence for the existence and dispersion - like nature of these interactions @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the strength of these ag@xmath2ag interactions based on the dft results alone ; a comprehensive _ ab initio _ study of [ cl  ag ",
    "ph@xmath0]@xmath3 dimers suggests a bond energy of approximately 15kjmol@xmath9 @xcite , but larger values can also be found elsewhere in the literature @xcite . in either case",
    ", what is clear is that the energies involved are at least an order of magnitude lower than typical values for covalent or ionic bonds , and this results in a heightened sensitivity to the effects of _",
    "e.g. _  temperature and pressure .    even without any explicit consideration of the dispersion - like ag@xmath2ag interactions , dft calculations",
    "show that the framework can adopt a wide variety of different geometries with essentially equivalent lattice enthalpies @xcite . for each geometry , the covalent co  c , c  n and ag ",
    "n interactions are unchanged ( and the ag@xmath2ag overlap populations remain equal to zero ) , but the ag atoms show considerable tolerance to a range of ag@xmath2ag distances . to some extent this will reflect the relatively high polarisability of the ag@xmath17 cation @xcite , which translates to a `` fluffiness '' of its valence electron cloud .",
    "this `` fluffiness '' may well contribute to the superionic behaviour of some ag@xmath17 salts @xcite , where cation polarisability can play a key role in diffusion mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the relevance here is that this polarisability will facilitate flexibility within the ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 framework by allowing relatively large displacements of the ag atoms as the material is heated .",
    "the neutron time - of - flight diffractometer gem  @xcite at the isis pulsed spallation source was used to collect total scattering patterns from a polycrystalline ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 sample , prepared as in @xcite .",
    "data were collected over a large range of scattering vectors of magnitudes @xmath49@xmath9 , giving a real - space resolution of order @xmath50 . for the experiment ,",
    "approximately 3 g of sample was placed within a cylindrical thin - walled vanadium can of 8.3 mm diameter and 5.8 cm height , which was in turn mounted within a top - loading ccr .",
    "data suitable for subsequent rmc analysis were collected at temperatures of 10 , 50 , 150 and 300k .",
    "following their collection , the total scattering data were corrected using standard methods , taking into account the effects of background scattering , absorption , multiple scattering within the sample , beam intensity variations , and the placzek inelasticity correction @xcite .",

    "the experimental bragg diffraction profiles were fitted with the gsas rietveld refinement program @xcite using the published structural model @xcite . as we found in our previous crystallographic study @xcite , the room temperature diffraction pattern could be fitted well using a standard peak shape function , while data collected at lower temperatures required special treatment [ fig .  [ fig2 ] ] .",

    "experimental data are given as points , the fitted profile is shown as a solid line , and the difference ( fit@xmath62data ) is shown beneath each curve . ]    in order to refine those data collected at lower temperatures , and their increased variation in peak widths , we considered that the polycrystalline sample contained a distribution of lattice parameters @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we employed a multi - phase model in our structural refinements in which the ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 powder sample is treated as a mixture of phases with different unit cell parameters but with common relative atomic positions and atomic displacement parameters ( at a given temperature ) .",
    "there is an implicit assumption here that the same set of atomic coordinates can be used for a distribution of cell parameters at a given temperature . while this will translate to some additional uncertainty in _",

    ", the contribution of each phase ( calculated using the room temperature peak - shape parameters ) is added to produce a composite diffraction profile that is capable of assuming anisotropic peak shapes .",
    "the gsas refinement process then involved variation not only of the atomic positions and displacement parameters , but also of the relative populations of each phase .",
    "as such , we avoided refining a single set of lattice parameters , obtaining instead a distribution profile across a range of unit cell dimensions .",

    "the fact that the experimental distribution functions do not change significantly across our different rmc refinements strongly indicates a relatively constrained [ coc@xmath1 coordination geometry that is not easily affected by temperature .",
    "rmc bond angle distributions : intra - octahedral c  co  c angles and co  c  n , c ",
    "n  ag and n  ag  n angles .",
    "successive data sets are shifted vertically by multiples of 6 units . in all cases ,",
    "the broader distributions correspond to higher temperatures . ]",
    "we find much greater variation in bond angles along the co ",
    "ag  nc  co linkages .",
    "there are three symmetry - independent angles to consider  namely , co ",
    "n  and the corresponding distributions are also shown in fig .  [ fig9 ] .",
    "again , the lowest - temperature distributions will be artificially broadened , and keeping this in mind we see that all three angles reflect a significant flexibility along the entire linkage .",
    "the strongest changes are observed for the c ",
    "n  ag angles .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the conclusions drawn from average structure analysis , where we expected the large changes in framework geometry to be accommodated primarily via hingeing of the linear linkages at the n atom [ fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ] . as anticipated for a linear coordination geometry , the distribution in n ",
    "n angles shows a much stronger thermal variation than the intra - polyhedral [ coc@xmath1 angles .    that the c  co  c angle distributions are essentially temperature - independent despite the large c atom displacements seen in the average structure analysis is a clear indication that the atomic displacements in our rmc configurations are strongly correlated .",
    "however , it is difficult to obtain a quantitative handle on these correlations from a consideration of pair and triplet distribution functions alone .",
    "instead we turn to geometric algebra , which permits a more sophisticated real - space analysis .      by comparing the orientations of [ coc@xmath1 octahedra within an ensemble of rmc configurations ,",
    "it is possible to quantify two aspects of their dynamical behaviour : first , we obtain a measure of the magnitude of octahedral tilts for each octahedron ; second , we can determine the extent to which each octahedron distorts via stretching of the co  c bonds and/or bending of the c  co  c angles .",
    "we carry out these calculations using a method based on geometric algebra @xcite , as implemented in the program gasp @xcite . for each octahedron",
    ", the program first computes an associated `` rotor '' , an algebraic quantity whose components represent , to first order , the degree of rotation about the three cartesian axes .",
    "these rotor components are then used by the program to determine the magnitudes of octahedral translations , rotations and distortions ( due both to bending and to stretching of bonds ) . by analysing how these values are affected by temperature",
    ", we can determine whether the dominant lattice vibrations involve octahedral deformation modes , or alternatively whether the co coordination geometries are reasonably well preserved .",
    "the individual rotor components also indicate whether any particular rotation directions are preferred .    the rotational , translational and distortive ( c  co  c bending and co ",
    "c stretching ) components of the octahedral motion calculated from our rmc configurations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . in this figure ,",
    "the various components are compared with the values calculated from reference configurations , which share the same set of atomic displacements given by rmc but where these have now been distributed randomly throughout the configuration .",
    "both rmc and `` reference '' configurations share the same average structure , but higher - order correlations will be constrained in the former via refinement against the experimental @xmath52 function .",
    "this comparison then helps illustrate the way in which @xmath52 data provide information about local correlations . in this specific case",
    ", it is apparent that the extent to which [ coc@xmath1 octahedra are distorted by bond stretching and bond bending displacements is substantially smaller in our rmc configurations than is required by the average structure information . instead , the atomic displacements appear to be correlated more strongly in the form of octahedral rotations , which occur with a significantly greater probability than the average structure demands .",
    "this is strong evidence of the rum - type vibrations discussed above .",
    "it is straightforward to show that one expects the same degree of polyhedral translation in both cases ( since this depends essentially on the root - mean - squared co displacement , which is preserved ) , and that this is indeed the case is a good internal check on our analysis .",
    "[ coc@xmath1 octahedral displacement components calculated using gasp for our rmc configurations ( filled circles , solid lines ) and for `` reference '' configurations ( open squares , dashed lines ) : ( a ) rotations , ( b ) translations , ( c ) bond - bending deformations , and ( d ) bond - stretching deformations . ]    as explained above our rmc configurations are known to contain a certain degree of random `` noise '' , responsible for adding a baseline level of atomic motion that is particularly noticeable at low temperatures . together with the baseline contribution due to zero point motion",
    ", these effects explain why our geometric algebra analysis shows non - zero levels of polyhedral motion and deformation even at low temperatures . by subtracting the projected 0k values ,",
    "we arrive at the baseline - corrected plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) .",
    "this representation of our gasp analysis shows that on heating ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 , one populates vibrational modes that involve translations and rotations of [ coc@xmath1 in preference to c  co ",
    "c bending modes and co ",
    "c stretching modes .",
    "this is all very intuitive , and certainly consistent with the expectations of a rum analysis @xcite .",
    "( a ) thermal variation in [ coc@xmath1 octahedral displacement patterns , after correction for the 0k rmc background : translations ( open circles ) , rotations ( filled circles ) , bond - bending deformations ( crosses ) and bond - stretching deformations ( filled squares ) .",
    "the right - hand panels show the distributions of [ coc@xmath1 rotation angles around ( b ) axes perpendicular to @xmath34 and ( c ) an axis parallel to @xmath34 . in panels ( b ) and",
    "( c ) , the broader distributions correspond to higher temperatures . ]",
    "as discussed above , it is possible to determine the extent to which [ coc@xmath1 octahedra rotate in different directions . by virtue of the @xmath25 site symmetry at the co position , there are two key axes to consider : these correspond to rotations around @xmath32 and others around @xmath34 . panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .  [ fig11 ] give plots of the distribution of rotation angles around both of these axes .",
    "this figure shows that the distribution around @xmath34 is broader at each temperature point than that around @xmath32 , and hence the root - mean - squared deviation is larger , but that these axial rotations may have saturated by 150k .",
    "we note that with only one temperature point above 150k it is impossible for us to determine whether this saturation is indeed a real effect .      with 16 atoms in the primitive unit cell ,",
    "the lattice dynamics of ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 is characterised by a set of 48 phonon modes . as such ,",
    "this is a substantially more complex system than either mgo or srtio@xmath0 ( 6 and 15 modes , respectively ) , for which a phonons - from - total - scattering ( pfts ) approach has been applied previously @xcite .",
    "the overall range in phonon frequencies is similar in all cases , and so an increase in the number of phonon modes corresponds to a finer separation between mode frequencies across the phonon spectrum . in terms of our phonon calculations",
    "this makes meaningful analysis of the three - dimensional rmc phonon dispersion curves particularly difficult , precisely because the confidence in mode frequency values approaches the separation between successive modes .",
    "consequently , our pfts analysis focusses on the phonon density of states , which helps condense the quantity of vibrational information into a more manageable form .",
    "considering first the overall structure of the phonon density of states , we obtain the most accurate picture from the ensemble of rmc configurations that corresponds to a temperature of 300k , where the effects of anisotropic peak broadening are negligible .",
    "the overall density of states reveals three main features : ( i ) a sharp peak at approximately 3thz ; ( ii ) a broader distribution of modes , peaking at approximately 10thz and with an upper limit of _ ca _ 25thz ; and ( iii ) a very high frequency component , composed of a peak at 35thz together with a broader distribution centred around the same value [ fig .",
    "[ fig12](a ) ] .",
    "random `` noise '' in the configuration has the effect of adding an exponential decay function to the pfts density of states , and this is why the form of the d.o.s .",
    "function appears perhaps slightly unfamiliar .",
    "what we are really interested in is the deviation from this exponential background , which reflects the energies of correlated atomic displacements .",
    "( a ) powder - averaged phonon density of states calculated from an ensemble of 1000 separate 300k rmc configurations .",
    "the three energy regimes referred to in the text are labelled .",
    "( b ) scaled partial phonon densities of states , shifted vertically by multiples of 25 units .",
    "each scaled partial density of states ( thick line ) is superposed on the overall density of states ( thin line ) for comparison . for the rum curve , the component due to rotations around @xmath34 , which oscillates more strongly than the overall rmc curve , is also shown . ]    in order to determine the types of atomic displacements characterised by the different frequency regimes of this density of states , we calculated a series of partial phonon densities of states for different types of displacement .",
    "we calculated these partial densities of states by weighting each mode by the projection of its eigenvector onto a relevant set of displacement patterns .",
    "so , for example , a mode whose eigenvector could be represented as a linear combination of the rums would project strongly onto the set of rum eigenvectors , and so its contribution to the rum partial density of states would be large .",
    "the corresponding functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12](b ) for co atoms , ag atoms , cn groups and also for rum - type rotations of [ coc@xmath1 octahedra ( essentially a subset of the cn group displacements ) .",
    "naturally each of these types of displacements contribute to modes at many different wave - vectors , but some overall features do emerge .",
    "what we are comparing at each stage is the likelihood of observing particular displacement patterns at a given energy value relative to the overall density of phonon modes at that energy .",
    "our analysis shows that the peak at lowest frequencies projects most strongly onto the rum displacements , and especially those corresponding to rotations around @xmath34 .",
    "this reflects some of the results of the gasp analysis above : the population of rums at low temperatures , and also the broader distributions for rotations around @xmath34 than around @xmath32 .",
    "the mid - frequency region contains components of all types of displacements , but the contribution of rums falls to zero most quickly on moving to higher energies .",
    "the highest - frequency regime corresponds exclusively to stretching modes of the cn groups .",
    "the energy calculated for these modes comes directly from the width of the cn peak at 1.15  in the experimental @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this peak width is especially sensitive to the effects of truncation ripples in the fourier transform from @xmath51 , and so we expect the corresponding phonon frequencies to be substantially lower than experimental values .",
    "here we obtain a mean value of approximately 35thz , which underestimates the literature values by around 10thz @xcite .",
    "this difference corresponds to a broadening of the cn peak of less than 30% , which is not at all unreasonable .",
    "one of the key results in our previous thermal expansion study was the decrease in ag displacement frequencies with increasing temperatures , which provided a dynamical mechanism for overcoming the small changes in lattice enthalpies associated with thermal expansion of the lattice @xcite .",
    "here we can observe this softening directly by considering the ag partial phonon density of states calculated for each temperature point in our rmc analysis ; the corresponding plots are given in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "again the form of these partial density of states contains an exponential background contribution due to `` noise '' in the rmc configurations .",
    "not withstanding this effect , there is certainly an overall decrease in energy scale ( the weighted mean frequencies corresponding precisely to those given in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the lowest - frequency modes actually increase in energy with increasing temperature , despite the overall decrease in energy for ag displacements .",
    "this indicates that there are modes with negative grneisen parameters that involve ag translations ( remembering that the material as a whole shows pte ) , and also that these modes occur at low energies . a natural candidate for these phonon modes",
    "is the collection of transverse vibrations of co ",
    "co linkages , which may also couple with rums of the [ coc@xmath1 octahedra .",
    "energy - corrected ag partial phonon densities of states calculated from our rmc configurations .",
    "successive curves have been raised by 2.5 units in each case to aid visibility .",
    "dashed lines are guides to the eye that connect equivalent modes in each set of data . ]",
    "it is also interesting to note that the magnitude of the shifts in phonon frequencies can be moderately large : one can estimate from fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] that values of some mode grneisen parameters @xmath87 are of the order of at least @xmath88 .",
    "consequently the magnitude of the overall thermal expansion behaviour ( @xmath89 of the order of 0.5 , subject to the difficulty in obtaining a measure of the true compressibility @xcite ) reflects a difference between competing thermal expansion effects of quite different types of lattice vibrations .",
    "this result contrasts sharply the behaviour of other nte systems such as zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 and zn(cn)@xmath3 , where the overall behaviour is dominated by contributions from sets of phonon modes with similar grneisen parameters @xcite .",
    "this means that the extent of thermal expansion in ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 may be very sensitive to changes in composition , because subtle variations in the magnitudes of individual grneisen parameters will have a much greater relative impact on their differences than on their sum .",
    "we conclude this section by commenting that the similarity in structure of the ag partial phonon density of states at each temperature point is encouraging in terms of the robustness of the pfts approach in this case .",
    "uncorrelated atomic motion produces a density of states that is an exponential decay function , with none of the reproducible structure seen in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] . the level of detail of the phonon spectrum could certainly be improved if we were to extend our analysis to larger rmc configurations and/or larger configurational ensembles ( while suffering the associated cost in additional computation time ) .",
    "however , the reproducibility we see at the level of analysis given here lends us some confidence that our results in terms of the key dynamical features and their general temperature dependencies are sufficiently robust for the purposes of this investigation .",
    "this study has shown that the thermal expansion behaviour of ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 actually represents a somewhat complex synthesis of various different local effects .",
    "for example , it was always suspected that covalent bonding interactions would constrain thermal expansion along the co ",
    "ag  nc  co linkages , but we see here that actually the expansion of individual bonds is quite large , and that this pte effect is counteracted by the effects of transverse vibrational motion ( _ cf_.  the local structure behaviour in zn(cn)@xmath3 @xcite ) . similarly , the decrease in energy at higher temperatures seen for the ag partial phonon density of states occurs as the ( perhaps fortuitous ) balance between vibrational modes with moderately - large negative _ and _ positive grneisen parameters .",
    "our analysis has also illustrated the complementary roles played by what one might term `` structural '' and `` dynamical '' flexibility of the co ",
    "ag  nc  co linkages . by `` structural flexibility '' what we mean is that the average geometry of these linkages is able to vary in order to preserve the [ coc@xmath1 coordination geometries as the lattice parameters change with temperature .",
    "this was seen in particular in terms of thermal variation of the ag ",
    "n  c bond angles . alternatively , by `` dynamical flexibility '' we mean the ability to support low - energy transverse vibrational modes , which help constrain thermal expansion of the co@xmath2co vector .",
    "we showed in particular the importance of rums , where transverse vibrational motion is correlated around individual metal centres in the form of polyhedral rotations and translations .",
    "our results strongly suggest that similarly atypical behaviour may be found in many other extended framework materials with flexible structures .",
    "indeed in our parallel dft study it emerged that the au - containing analogue ag@xmath0[co(cn)@xmath1 is a very likely a colossal thermal expansion material @xcite .",
    "the same principles may yet prove relevant to other quite different materials , such as the increasingly diverse and widely - studied family of metal - organic frameworks ( mofs ) @xcite .",
    "10                                                                                                                  there are two effects responsible for this broadening .",
    "the first is that fourier truncation in @xmath90-space broadens the low-@xmath82 peaks in the @xmath52 data ; the second is that , by not taking into account the effects of instrument resolution on different detector banks ( a limitation we are working towards overcoming ) , there is a similar dampening of the @xmath52 function that will serve to broaden the rmc distributions . because these broadening effects are independent of temperature , the _ relative _ difference between `` ideal '' and experimental peak widths is greatest at low temperatures , where the peaks in the @xmath52 function should be much sharper than is observed",
    "accordingly , the low - temperature partial pair distributions are fitted most satisfactorily during the rmc refinement process by increasing atomic motion to what may be a slightly unphysical level . at later stages in our analysis",
    ", we will see that this gives rise to broadening of the pair and triplet correlation functions at low temperatures , a higher - than - expected degree of polyhedral motion and deformation , and also a decrease in the calculated phonon frequencies .",
    "these effects are really only noticeable because we are attempting to extract very detailed and subtle information from our total scattering data .            moreover , because the energy of the cn stretch is so much higher than thermal energy at all of the temperatures considered here , actually the phonon mode frequency calculated from the cn peak width is independent of temperature .",
    "we do not observe any significant change at all in the cn peak widths between 10 and 300k , and indeed the cn stretching frequencies consistently emerged in the region 3540thz for each of our temperature points ."
