    "mergers have great impacts on cluster evolution .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations @xcite show that mergers cause shocks and turbulence in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "while a large part of the dissipated energy in the shocks and turbulence is transformed into the thermal icm , some are most likely transported into a non - thermal form such as cosmic - rays and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "in fact , some merging clusters have diffuse non - thermal synchrotron radio emissions , which is direct evidence of the existence of the cosmic - ray electrons whose energy is @xmath9 gev and the magnetic fields of @xmath10 g in the icm . such diffuse non - thermal radio sources are classified into two types owing to their morphology and location .",
    "radio halos have similar morphology as the icm x - ray emission and are located in the central part of the cluster @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , radio relics usually have an arc - like shape and are located in the periphery of the cluster @xcite . the recent status of this field is extensively reviewed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because of their morphology and locations , it has been believed that radio relics trace outgoing shocks seen in the later phases of major mergers .",
    "recently , in fact , discontinuities of the icm physical quantities such as temperature and density are found in the outer edge of some radio relics , which is direct evidence of the association of relics with shocks .",
    "mach numbers of shocks related to the relics can be observationally estimated in two independent ways . from the synchrotron radio spectral index , we are able to obtain the cosmic - ray electron energy spectral index @xcite , which can be related with the shock mach numbers assuming a simple diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "x - ray observations of the icm are able to determine directly the mach number through the detection of discontinuities of the icm physical quantities such as temperature and density with ranking - hugoniot jump conditions @xcite .",
    "if the simple diffusive shock acceleration model is valid , both methods have to give us consistent results .",

    "therefore , it is important to observe more relics in both radio and x - rays in order to reveal their origin .",

    "comparison between synchrotron and inverse compton fluxes provides us with the magnetic field strength .",
    "even if only the upper limit of the inverse compton flux is obtained , we are able to get the lower limit of the field strength . although a lot of efforts have been made to search for such non - thermal x - rays from cluster radio halos and relics @xcite , this is still challenging and any firm detections have not been reported unfortunately .",

    "@xcite proposed a triple merger scenario , where interaction of multiple shocks generate a linear shape shock front like `` toothbrush '' relic .    in a re - acceleration scenario @xcite , where the electrons in the relic have already accelerated once somewhere , the spectrum has a memory of the past acceleration history . in other words ,",

    "a non - linear acceleration model @xcite , where the shock structures are modified by the interactions between the thermal icm and accelerated non - thermal particles , is another possibility to explain this kind of discrepancy .",

    "fixing the normalization in the radio observation range , therefore , increase ( or decrease ) of the absolute value of the radio spectral index causes increase ( or decrease ) of synchrotron flux corresponding to the inverse compton component , which results in increase ( or decrease ) of the lower limit on the magnetic field strength .",

    "the electron number density of the thermal icm in the relic region is estimated to be @xmath130 @xmath122 . with this value and the temperature of this region ( @xmath131 kev ) ,",
    "the energy density of the thermal icm is @xmath132 erg @xmath122 , assuming that the mean molecular weight is 0.6 . with the lower limit of the magnetic field strength ( @xmath125 ) ,",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field is @xmath133 erg @xmath122 . as a result , @xmath134 , which means that the magnetic energy could be more than a few % of the thermal one and that the icm evolution and structures could be somewhat affected by the magnetic field . from the upper limit of the inverse compton component ,",
    "the energy density of the relativistic electrons corresponding to 0.3 - 10 kev x - ray band ( or , @xmath128 ) becomes @xmath135 erg @xmath4 .",

    "we observed the field around the `` toothbrush '' radio relic in the galaxy cluster 1rxs j0603.3 + 4214 with suzaku . from the xis analysis",
    ", we found that the mach number at the outer edge of the relic derived from the temperature difference is significantly lower than the value derived from the radio spectral index assuming a simple dsa theory @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a simple dsa theory does not hold at least for this object .",
    "the re - acceleration scenario could explain this discrepancy .",
    "alternatively , interactions of multiple shocks owing to complicated dynamical history would resolve both this problem and the peculiar linear shape of the relic .",
    "we also confirmed that the mach number of the possible shock , which is elongated towards the west of the relic , is consistent with the value obtained from xmm - newton data @xcite in an independent way .",
    "we searched for the non - thermal inverse compton component in the relic region and set an upper limit on the flux of @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 . comparing the synchrotron radio flux with this upper limit , we obtained a lower limit on the magnetic field strength of @xmath137 , which means that the magnetic energy could be more than a few % of the thermal energy .",

    "<S> we present the results of suzaku observations of the galaxy cluster 1rxs j0603.3 + 4214 with `` toothbrush '' radio relic . </S>",
