    "there are multiple proposed explanations for agesm33 - 31 .",
    "the first is that it is part of the magellanic stream .",
    "it has been suggested that wright s cloud is part of the stream and , as agesm33 - 31 has a similar velocity , it could simply be a further extension .",
    "however , the magellanic stream at this point of the sky is extremely sparse and made up largely of very small clouds so agesm33 - 31 appears incongruent .",
    "secondly , agesm33 - 31 could be the remnants of a dark galaxy that has been disrupted through an event such as an interaction .",
    "* thilker , braun & walterbos 2002 ) describe m33chvc as a ` dark companion ' to m33 .",
    "its size , velocity width , and dispersion are comparable to that of a face on galaxy . however , these scenarios do not account for the hole in agesm33 - 31 .",
    "we have investigated the possibility that this hole may have been formed by a supernova , but found it to be around an order of magnitude too large for this to be a satisfactory explanation .",
    "agesm33 - 31 remains an interesting and intriguing object , we would need additional observations to allow us to make further comment on its nature .",
