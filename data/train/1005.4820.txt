    "in the absence of nonlinearity ( or many - body interactions in quantum systems ) all eigenstates in one - dimensional random lattices with disorder are spatially localized .",
    "this is anderson localization @xcite , which has been discovered fifty years ago in disordered crystals as a localization of electronic wavefunction .",
    "it can be interpreted as an interference effect between multiple scatterings of the electron on random defects of the potential .",
    "recent experiments on the observation of anderson localization were performed with light propagation in spatially random optical media @xcite , with noninteracting bose - einstein condensates expanding in random optical potentials @xcite , and with wave localization in a microwave cavity filled with randomly distributed scatterers @xcite .    in many situations nonlinear terms in the wave equations ( respectively , many body interaction terms in quantum systems ) have to be included .",
    "thus , a fundamental question which has attracted the attention of many researchers is what happens to an initial excitation of arbitrary shape in a nonlinear disordered lattice .",
    "nonlinearity renormalizes excitation frequencies , thereby inducing interaction between nms .",
    "numerical studies show that wave packets spread subdiffusively and anderson localization is destroyed @xcite . in the regime of strong nonlinearity , far from where it can be treated perturbatively , new localization effects of selftrapping occur @xcite .",
    "a theoretical explanation of the subdiffusive spreading was offered in refs .",
    "it is based on the fact that the considered models are in general nonintegrable .",
    "therefore deterministic chaos will lead to an incoherent spreading .",
    "estimates of the excitation transfer rate across the packet tail are obtained by calculating probabilities of mode - mode resonances inside the packet .",
    "some predictions of this approach include the effect of different degrees of nonlinearity and were successfully tested in @xcite .    in this work we study the statistical properties of mode - mode interactions .",
    "we focus on i ) the localization volume of a mode which defines the number of interacting partner modes , ii ) the overlap integrals which determine the interaction strength , iii ) the average spacing between eigenvalues of interacting modes which sets a scale for the nonlinearity strength , and iv ) resonance probabilities of interacting modes .",
    "we discuss the results in the light of recent studies @xcite on spreading of wave packets in disordered nonlinear systems , and relate our findings to the quantum two interacting particle problem in a random chain .     versus normalized eigenvalue for w=0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 ( from top to bottom ) .",

    "a widely used quantity is the participation number @xmath45 .",

    "another quantity is the effective distance between the exponential tails of the eigenvector , which is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the second moment of the norm density distribution .",
    "both quantities yield the exact width of a flat and compactly distributed norm density distribution . however when fluctuations are included , @xmath48 will be reduced and underestimates the correct volume , while the effective distance does not .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath49 as a measure of the localization volume .    we calculate numerically the average localization volume @xmath50 and participation number @xmath51 of nms as a function of @xmath6 ( see fig .  [ fig_l ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we fix the strength of disorder @xmath6 and take a chain which is much longer than @xmath52 .",
    "we calculate @xmath40 and @xmath53 , taking into account only those modes whose eigenvalues are located near the bandwidth center and which are not close to the boundaries of a lattice",
    ". then , we take another realization and repeat the procedure . finally , we perform the averaging with respect to different disorder realizations .",
    "we find that the localization volume @xmath40 scales on average as @xmath54 for weak disorder ( see the dashed lines on fig .  [ fig_l ] ) , and tends to @xmath55 in the limit of strong disorder .",
    "we also note that the participation number is almost identical to the localization length for weak disorder , and therefore misses the localization volume by a factor of three .",
    "our numerical results indicate that multi - humped nms are rare and do not affect the statistical results on v. these multi - humped nms are localized over a number of lattice sites which can be at far distance from each other in real space ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if they were statistically relevant , the second moments would be overestimated .",
    "however , we find that in the limit of strong disorder @xmath56 the localization volume @xmath57 , therefore multi - humped states do not significantly contribute ( although we admit that there might be a measurable contribution in this limit of strong disorder ) . in the limit of weak disorder",
    "we observe that @xmath58 scale in the same way with the disorder strength , therefore we can exclude any significant statistical relevance of multi - humped nms in this regime .",
    "we study statistical properties of the _ absolute values _ of the overlap integrals ( [ overlap ] ) perturbatively for weak disorder , and numerically using two different methods .",
    "in particular we aim at estimating the average absolute value of these overlap integrals for nms which are interacting with each other within the range of one localization volume , in order to exclude statistically irrelevant exponentially weak interactions of distant nms .",
    "note , that in following notations , the absolute value is omitted for the sake of simplicity . in order to avoid multiple repetitions in ( [ overlap ] ) we use @xmath59 .    _ perturbative calculations .",

    "it is straightforward to obtain that the disorder induced correction will be of the same order as ( [ oi9 - 2 ] ) , which is still smaller than the unperturbed value .",
    "thus the average value of @xmath100 up to the first order of perturbation in @xmath6 is given by ( remember that @xmath101 ) @xmath102 where @xmath103 is some constant independent on the system s parameters .",
