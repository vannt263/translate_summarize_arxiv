    "the study of quantum light - matter interactions near metals can be used to explore fundamental quantum optical regimes such as modified spontaneous emission  @xcite and the strong coupling regime  @xcite , with applications ranging from single - photon transistors  @xcite to plasmon lasing and spacing  @xcite .",
    "metal structures enable surface plasmon polaritons which give rise to pronounced resonances in a similar way to high - q ( quality factor ) cavity structures .",
    "however , metals are significantly more complicated to model because of material losses , and , e.g. , standard mode expansion techniques that are well used in quantum optics theory typically fail .",
    "this motivates the need for quantum optics models that can be applied to metallic environments , and can expect to access new excitation regimes that are unique to plasmonic systems .",
    "recently , there has been interest in the coherent excitation of a single atom or quantum dot ( qd ) near a metal surface .",
    "as is well known from atomic optics , a resonantly driven atom ( or qd ) can yield a `` mollow triplet '' for the incoherent spectrum if the coherent rabi oscillations have a frequency that is larger than the decay rates in the system  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite modelled qd metal - nanoparticle ( mnp ) interactions through a master equation ( me ) approach by assuming a single lorentzian response for the metal and estimated the dot - metal coupling parameters from electromagnetic simulations ; such an approach is useful but restricted since it essentially ignores the higher - order plasmon modes and can not be used if the dot is too close to the metal surface  typically restricted to separation distances greater than a radius of the particle  @xcite or else coupling to higher - order plasmons becomes important .",
    "gonzalez - tudela _ et al . _",
    "@xcite employed a time - convolutionless ( i.e. , time local ) me approach and explored the coupling for a driven qd near a metal planar surface ; this latter method allows one to incorporate the full non - lorentzian lineshape of the metal reservoir for qds that are close to the surface , however the effects of internal coupling  @xcite and spectral reshaping due to qd / mnp - to - detector propagation were neglected .",
    "internal coupling refers to coupling to the photon reservoir at the dressed - state resonances , since in general the scattering rates and radiative coupling depend on the driving field  @xcite . for a suitable mnp environment",
    ", the range of energy shifts of the dressed states can be substantial compared to the range of energies over which the ldos varies .",
    "the distance from the mnp to the detector is varied in the results presented below . ]    in this work , we introduce a powerful me technique that allows one to model the quantum light - matter interactions for any general photonic reservoir function , including lossy inhomogeneous structures .",
    "the only restriction we use is the second - order born approximation , which is valid for the weak qd - plasmon coupling regime that we consider .",
    "we apply this approach to study the incoherent spectrum that is detected when a qd is driven resonantly near an 8-nm mnp .",
    "a schematic of this excitation scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in the strong - field excitation regime , we compute the fluorescence spectrum at a detector remotely located from the driven qd - mnp system , fully taking into account the effects of light propagation and optical quenching .",
    "we demonstrate that , as the field strength of the drive is increased , the ensuing mollow triplets becomes highly asymmetric .",
    "the mollow triplets gives direct access to the regime of quantum nanoplamonics and contains signatures of the mnp s photon bath function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we introduce the theory and me technique for modelling a coherently driven qd in the vicinity of a mnp .",
    "we also present an expression for the incoherent spectrum in terms of the medium green functions which are computed exactly . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we present calculations of the green functions and incoherent spectra for various pump intensities and pump laser detunings .",
    "the ensuing mollow spectrum is seen to be highly asymmetric and we show the importance of including internal coupling effects .",
    "we also study the effect of the qd - mnp separation and observe squeezing and anti - squeezing of the spectral resonances .",
    "theoretical expressions for the linewidths in terms of the ldos help to explain the physics .",
    "conclusions are offered in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we also include an appendix that presents the optical bloch equations for this system and discuss useful analytical limits of the incoherent spectrum .",
    "we first introduce the classical photonic green function of the mnp , where the nanoparticle is assumed to be in air . defining the mnp complex permittivity as @xmath0 ,",
    "then the photon green function satisfies the follow equation ( @xmath1 is implicit ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the unit dyadic .",
    "we use a drude model for a silver mnp , where @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , @xmath8=7.9  ev and @xmath9mev . for a spherical mnp ,",
    "the green function is computed exactly @xcite .",
    "the mnp green function can be understood in terms of having contributions from the fundamental dipole - like plasmon mode and a reservoir of higher - order plasmon modes .",
    "the dipole mode propagates to the far field , but the higher - order modes only couple in the near field .",
    "we consider an 8-nm radius mnp , where a qd center is at some distance @xmath10 above the mnp surface .",
    "we assume there is a detector , at position @xmath11 , that is 10  @xmath12 m from the surface ( i.e. , in the far field ) .     at the point where the @xmath13 located around a 8-nm silver mnp .",

    "then a qd exciton can be strongly coupled to the mnp resulting in vacuum rabi splitting  @xcite ; this strong coupling regime becomes accessible by coupling to the higher - order plasmon peaks rather than at the weaker dipole mode peak of the ldos ; one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) that the corresponding ldos ( red solid , upper ) at high order plasmon modes is several times larger than at the dipole mode peak . for larger spatial separations between the qd and mnp surface ,",
