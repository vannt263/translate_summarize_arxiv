    "the cosmos field @xcite is the largest contiguous multi - wavelength probe of the high - redshift galaxy distribution , and a major task for the survey will be to extract improved measurements of galaxy clustering at these early times . in this initial paper , we will be concerned with the simplest of these measures : the angular two - point correlation function , @xmath0 . demonstrating a robust measurement of this quantity is a minimum requirement for verifying that the survey completeness is understood , as a basis for future more elaborate analysis .",
    "the main aim of this paper is therefore to present measurements of the two - point galaxy clustering statistic on the cosmos field using three independently generated catalogs , and to compare the results with existing data .",
    "we also compare the amplitudes we measure to those found in a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation .",
    "the key feature of the cosmos field is that it is completely covered by the largest existing mosaic of image tiles from the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the hubble space telescope @xcite . with respect to ground - based surveys , in addition to the exceptional image quality",
    ", the great advantage of this dataset is the superior photometric accuracy and stability over the entire field of view of the survey , which in turn makes it possible to measure the clustering of galaxies on large scales and at faint magnitudes where the amplitude of the galaxy correlation function @xmath0 is very small .",
    "we use this rich dataset to investigate the clustering properties of the field galaxy population on degree scales . in future papers",
    ", we will present a more detailed study of galaxy clustering using photometric redshifts .",
    "our objective here is simply to present the global properties of the field in terms of simple two - point statistics for catalogs selected by apparent magnitude .",
    "the cosmos field has been imaged by many ground - based facilities , amongst them the subaru telescope @xcite , and we compare the cosmos acs catalog ( described in @xcite ) with two ground - based catalogs : the subaru optical catalog described by @xcite and the cfhtls - t03 catalog used by mccracken et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "each of these have significantly different masks , especially with regard to ghosting around bright stars . as will be demonstrated , the results of these independent determinations are in good agreement , and display a consistently higher amplitude at faint magnitudes than has been suggested in previous work .",
    "all of the three catalogs were prepared independently . for full details of the acs catalog ,",
    "see @xcite ; the subaru catalogs are described in @xcite .",
    "a full description of the cfhtls catalogs , based on the images corresponding to the release cfhtls - t03 , can be found in mccracken et al 2007 .",
    "the acs data are constructed from a mosaic of 575 image tiles taken over 588 orbits of the hst .",
    "the 50% completeness limit of the catalog is 26.6 f814w magnitudes .",
    "suprimecam consists of 10 lincoln - labs 8k @xmath6 4k ccds with a plate scale of @xmath7 per pixel .",
    "however , a plate scale of @xmath8 per pixel was used for the final image to ensure that the images with good seeing were not undersampled .",
    "a special dither pattern including camera rotations ( subaru is an alt - azimuth telescope ) was used to ensure every portion of the field was imaged by at least four different ccds .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the subaru catalog was based on a mosaic of 115 subaru images taken with the suprime camera on the subaru 8 m telescope .",
    "the image has a median seeing of @xmath9 and a @xmath10 completeness of @xmath11 .",
    "the cfhtls catalog is derived from the terapix cfhtls - t03 release .",
    "the cfhtls stacks were taken using the megacam camera on the 3.6 m cfht telescope .",
    "megacam covers 1 deg@xmath12 with @xmath13 pixels using 36 separate @xmath14 rockwell ccds . note",
    "that , unlike the subaru and acs data , the cfhtls - t03 image consists of a single megacam pointing .",
    "the cfhtls - t03 d2-i dataset comprises 153 images and has a median seeing of @xmath15 .",
    "the 50% completeness of this dataset is @xmath16 magnitudes .    in all three catalogs ,",
    "the star - galaxy separation is carried out using a morphological classifier .",
    "we emphasize that the classifiers were determined independently for each catalog ; we did not , for example , use the acs morphologies to perform star - galaxy separation on the cfhtls or subaru images , or use the subaru images as detection images for the acs data .",
    "the subaru images cover the full 2  deg@xmath12 of the cosmos field while the acs tiling covers a total of 1.7  deg@xmath12 ; the cfhtls - t03 images cover just the central 1  deg@xmath12 of the field .    in each catalog , regions around bright stars and near the edges of the field were masked . for the acs catalogs",
    ", we use the same set of masks that were used for weak lensing measurements @xcite .",
    "these masks also remove many blended objects .",
    "we selected galaxies in progressively fainter slices of apparent @xmath17 magnitude . for the purposes of the paper we assume that the instrumental ab total magnitudes measured in each catalog are equivalent ; this is approximately true .",
    "@xcite present a detailed comparison of galaxy photometry between the three catalogs described here . figure 8 of their paper demonstrates that total instrumental magnitudes in each catalog agree well , to within 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "we used a sorted linked list in order to reduce computing time given the very large number of objects in each slice .",
    "these results are compared in figure  [ fig : wtheta - comp ] .",
    "the solid line shows measurements from the acs ; the triangles and stars correspond to measurements from subaru and cfht . at each angular bin for each survey , the error bars plotted are simple bootstrap errors .",
    "although these are not in general a perfect substitute for a full estimate of cosmic variance ( e.g. using an ensemble of simulations ) , they should give the correct magnitude of the uncertainty @xcite .",
    "for each of the four slices in apparent magnitude , the amplitude of @xmath0 measured in the subaru data agrees well with the measurements in the acs . at very small angular separations the acs data are higher than the ground - based results .",
    "for the two faintest bins ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) the agreement between the acs measurements and the subaru measurements is excellent .",
    "we now examine more closely the galaxy correlation function measured from the acs catalogs .",
    "as we have already seen , thanks to the excellent resolution of the acs images , we are able to measure clustering amplitudes to small separations , on the order of @xmath20 .",
    "conversely , as a consequence of the large areal coverage of the acs cosmos field , we can also measure amplitudes to large angular separations . in figure",
    "[ fig : wtheta - acs ] we show the angular correlation function @xmath0 as a function of angular separation for bright and faint samples with @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "in the previous sections we established that measurements between the different datasets are consistent . in this section ,",
    "we compare our measurements to those made on catalogs produced by @xcite .",
    "these catalogs were created using a semianalytic model to simulate galaxy formation within the evolving halo population of the extremely large millennium simulation .",
    "these simulated universes were then ` observed ' to produce light - cones , which can be then used to produce observations of identical geometry to those of real catalogs .",
    "each cosmos light - cone covers 2  deg@xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig : wtheta - millennium ] shows , as before , the amplitude of @xmath0 as a function of angular separation in four magnitude slices .",
    "points with error bars show measurements from the acs data .",
    "the solid line shows the average of measurements made from twenty light - cones extracted from the millennium simulation ; the dotted lines show the amplitude of the @xmath23 error bars .    for the two brighter slices , @xmath21 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the agreement between the simulations and observations at intermediate and small scales is remarkably good . at fainter magnitudes , and at larger scales , the amplitudes measured in the cosmos catalogs are consistently higher than the prediction of the simulations .",
    "since the simulations allow us to assess the amplitude of cosmic variance directly , we can easily conclude that this discrepancy can not plausibly be attributed to the cosmos field having above - average clustering .",
    "it therefore appears that the model predictions for @xmath0 at @xmath25 are too low ; we discuss this further below .",
    "from our measurements it is clear that the form of @xmath0 in the cosmos field does not correspond to a simple power law with a slope that is independent of median magnitude of the sample . in the past",
    ", determinations of galaxy clustering amplitude were usually given at a fixed angular scale over a small range of angular separations . from our data , it is clear that fitting @xmath0 only at small angular separations will result in different fitted amplitudes as compared to a fit over the entire range .",
    "therefore , in order to compare with results presented in the literature , we choose to carry out fits over .    in figure  [ fig : wtheta - comparisons ] we show the fitted amplitudes of @xmath0 as a function of the median magnitude of each slice . in comparing with literature measurements",
    ", we see that at bright magnitudes @xmath26 our measurements are approximately in agreement with the values presented in the literature .",
    "however , by @xmath27 , the cosmos field measurements are significantly higher than , for example the cfdf measurements of .",
    "this is true at all angles and for all measurements , whether they are from the ground based or space - based catalogs .",
    "photometric redshifts are available for all objects in the cosmos field @xcite .",
    "the slice with @xmath24 has a median redshift of @xmath28 ; the next faintest slice is at @xmath29 .",
    "if we examine figure 2 of @xcite we can see there is a significant over - density in the redshift range @xmath30 .",
    "it is possible that this structure could contribute to the enhanced signal on large scales seen in our data in these slices .",
    "some independent evidence exists that this structure raises the cosmos clustering amplitude above the ensemble average . in figure",
    "[ fig : wtheta - comparisons ] we have plotted the average amplitude of @xmath31 as a function of apparent median magnitude for the four independent deep fields of the canada - france legacy survey ( one of which is the d2 field described above ) , totalling an effective area of 3.2 deg@xmath12 .",
    "error bars correspond to the variance over all four fields .",
    "interestingly , at bright magnitudes , the cfhtls magnitudes agree with the cosmos measurements , and other literature values ; at intermediate magnitudes ( @xmath24 ) they are between the cosmos values and those from other surveys , whereas at fainter magnitudes they agree perfectly with the cosmos measurements , presumably because the median redshift probed by both surveys at these magnitude limits is beyond that of the rich structure in the cosmos field .",
    "the size of the cosmic variance error bars on the cfhtls measurements are also largest at intermediate magnitudes .",
    "these measurements are discussed in greater detail in a forthcoming paper ( mccracken et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this paper has presented measurements of the angular two - point correlation function in the cosmos field , @xmath0 , and how it depends on @xmath17-band magnitude depth .",
    "we have shown that consistent results are obtained using three independent datasets : hst acs ; subaru suprimecam ; and cfht megacam .",
    "the results agree well at bright magnitudes ( @xmath32 ) with previous measurements and with the predictions of semi - analytic mock catalogs constructed from the millennium simulation ( ms ) .",
    "the only slight caveat here is that the results at @xmath2 arcmin are at the high end of the ms predictions , which may reflect a single rich @xmath3 structure in the field .    at fainter magnitudes",
    ", however , a different picture emerges . by the time we reach the @xmath22 bin ,",
    "the cosmos measurements are consistently a factor 2 higher than the ms predictions at all angles . moreover , the cosmos measurements are consistent with the four - field average of measurements from the cfhtls survey .",
    "this discrepancy is well beyond the compass of cosmic variance from limited numbers of rich structures , as measured via the ensemble of simulations .",
    "thus , barring some undetected systematic that is consistent between all the datasets we have used , the conclusion must be that the ms predictions are too low at these magnitude levels .",
    "this could arise in a number of ways : the predicted degree of bias at high redshifts might be too low ; the luminosity function might be incorrect , resulting in too high a predicted mean redshift at these depths ; or alternatively the ms may miss foreground pairs of intrinsically faint galaxies because of the resolution limit of the simulation .",
    "the first possibility is particularly interesting given the current debate over the normalization of the primordial power spectrum , @xmath33 .",
    "the ms used @xmath34 , whereas wmap favors a smaller result  perhaps as low as @xmath35 ( spergel et al .",
    "since high - redshift galaxies are strongly biased already , a reduced @xmath33 will in fact boost the predicted galaxy clustering ( for a given galaxy mass ) .",
    "these issues will be explored further in future papers , where we make direct use of the photometric redshift data in the cosmos field .",
    "the hst cosmos treasury program was supported through nasa grant hst - go-09822 .",
