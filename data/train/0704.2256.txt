    "transport properties of nanosystems , e.g. , nanowires or single molecules , have recently been receiving significant attention mainly due to their possible application in future electronic devices . @xcite these properties strongly differ from those of macroscopic conductors .",
    "the most important obstacle in theoretical investigations of the transport phenomena originates from the coupling between nanosystem and macroscopic leads . because of this coupling , analysis of the electron correlations is more difficult than in the equilibrium case .    in nanosystems",
    "the charge carriers are usually distributed inhomogeneously . there",
    "exist several reasons for such an inhomogeneity :    _ ( i ) _ first , it may originate from a spatial confinement .",
    "@xcite in analogy to the case of a quantum well , one may expect that due to a small size of nanosystems , electrons are inhomogeneously distributed .",
    "in particular , recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy has shown the presence of the electronic standing waves at the end of a single  wall carbon nanotube.@xcite    _ ( ii ) _ additionally , in the transport phenomena it may originate from the applied voltage .",
    "@xcite in this case the system properties are determined by the chemical potentials of the left and right electrodes .",
    "different values of these potentials may lead to an inhomogeneous distribution as well .    _",
    "( iii ) _ similarly to the macroscopic case , inhomogeneous charge distribution in nanosystems should occur in the presence of impurities.@xcite    _ ( iv ) _ nanowires or molecular wires represent quasi ",
    "one  dimensional conductors .",
    "therefore , phenomena typical for low dimensional systems , e.g. , charge density waves may occur as well .",
    "@xcite recently it has been shown that the charge density waves are strongly modified by the bias voltage .",
    "@xcite apart from the low  voltage regime , they are incommensurate and the corresponding wave vector decreases discontinuously with the increase of the bias voltage .",
    "in this paper we focus on the impurity  induced inhomogeneities .",
    "it is known that an impurity in the electron gas produces local changes of the carrier concentration , known as the friedel oscillations @xcite that asymptotically decay with the distance from the impurity .",
    "the most of recent theoretical investigations of the friedel oscillations concerned the influence of the electronic correlations , that is of crucial importance in one ",
    "dimensional systems.@xcite it has been shown that correlations suppress the decay of the density oscillations.@xcite it is interesting that these oscillations give information about the impurities@xcite as well as the electron  electron interaction in luttinger liquid systems.@xcite in macroscopic systems , the friedel oscillations are closely related to the singularity in the response function for wave  vectors close to 2@xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the fermi wave  vector .",
    "if the nanosystem is isolated ( or more generally , is in equilibrium ) , @xmath0 is a well defined quantity .",
    "however , in the transport experiments the nanosystem is coupled to two macroscopic leads with different fermi levels and the difference between these fermi energies increases with the bias voltage .",
    "therefore , the meaning of @xmath0 is ambiguous .",
    "since the properties of a nanosystem are determined by the chemical potentials of the left and right electrodes , one may expect that the friedel oscillations should depend on the voltage as well . in this paper",
    "we analyze this dependence using the formalism of the nonequilibrium keldysh green functions .",
    "in particular , we derive an explicit formula for the voltage dependence of the wave  length of the friedel oscillations .",

    "the coupling between the nanowire and the leads is given by : @xmath20 in the following , we assume that the matrix elements @xmath21 are nonzero only for the edge atoms of the nanowire .    the electron distribution has been determined with the help of the nonequilibrium keldysh green functions . here , we follow the procedure used by kostyrko and buka in ref . .",
    "in particular , the local carrier density is expressed by the lesser green function , @xmath22 this quantity , in turn , is determined by the retarded and advanced green functions in the following way : @xmath23 where @xmath24_{ij}= 2 \\pi \\sum_{{\\bf k } } g^{*}_{{\\bf k},i,\\alpha } g_{{\\bf k},j,\\alpha } \\delta(\\omega-\\varepsilon_{{\\bf k},\\alpha}),\\ ] ] and @xmath25 stands for the fermi distribution function of the electrode @xmath13 .",
