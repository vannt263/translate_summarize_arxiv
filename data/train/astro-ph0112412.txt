    "various observations have revealed that clusters of galaxies are pervaded by the strong magnetic field of microgauss strength ( e.g. , see @xcite ; @xcite for reviews and references therein ) .",
    "the multi - frequency faraday - rotation measurements of polarized radio sources inside or behind a cluster have been used to estimate the magnetic field strength , combined with the x - ray data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , clarke , kronberg , & bhringer ( 2001 ) have drawn a firm conclusion that an intracluster hot plasma is universally magnetized by @xmath8 g fields under the assumption of @xmath9kpc field coherent scales , using @xmath10 normal low-@xmath11 _ rosat _ cluster sample selected to be free of unusual strong radio halos , widespread cooling flow and recent merger activity . however , except for a few cases such as some background rotation measures per square degree in the coma cluster ( @xcite ) , it is generally difficult to measure the angular profile of the magnetic field strength inside a cluster because of the lack of the number of radio sources available per cluster .",
    "the observations of cluster - wide diffuse radio halos have also led to the evidence of the microgauss field , which is believed to be synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons accelerated in the shock wave . moreover , in this case hard x - ray emission could be produced by the same relativistic electron population through the inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "the combined observation of hard x - ray emission and radio halos is therefore very attractive in the sense that it allows us to directly estimate the magnetic field strength without further restrictive assumptions for the coherent length and the electron distribution .",
    "the recent detections of hard x - ray emission have led to an independent estimation of @xmath12 g fields even in the outer ( @xmath13 ) envelopes of clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the origin of the intracluster magnetic fields still rests a mystery in cosmology .",
    "the following two scenarios have been usually investigated in the literature .",
    "one is based on the idea that the cluster field is related to the fields generated by dynamo mechanism in individual galaxies and subsequent wind - like activity transports and redistributes the magnetic fields in the intracluster medium ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the general prediction of galactic dynamo mechanism is that the galactic magnetic field could arise from an exponential amplification of a small _ seed _ field during a galactic lifetime and energy of the mean magnetic field",
    "could grow up to equipartition level with the turbulent energy of fluid ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is not still clear , however , that the galactic dynamo theory can explain the detection of microgauss magnetic fields in high-@xmath11 damped ly@xmath14 absorption systems , which are supposed to be protogalactic clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "an alternative scenario is that the intracluster magnetic fields may grow via adiabatic compression of a primordial field frozen with motions of cosmic plasma , where the primordial field is assumed to be produced somehow during the initial stages of cosmic evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; and also see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "recently , using the cosmological , magneto - hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters , dolag , bartelmann , & lesch ( 1999 ) have quantitatively shown that , if starting with the initial magnetic field of @xmath15 g strength , the final intracluster field can be amplified by the gravitationally induced collapsing motions to the observed strength of @xmath16 g irrespective of uniform or chaotic initial field configurations motivated by scenarios of the primordial or galactic - wind induced initial seed fields on mpc scales , respectively . it is undoubtedly clear that the knowledge of the intracluster magnetic field will lead to a more complete understanding of the physical conditions of the intracluster medium and of the possible dynamical role of magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field should play an essential role to the nonthermal processes such as the synchrotron and high energy radiations and possibly the cosmic ray production ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it is strongly desirable to perform further theoretical and observational investigations on these issues in more detail .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how the faraday rotation effect due to the intracluster magnetic field causes a secondary effect on the cmb polarization fields . while thomson scattering of temperature anisotropies on the last scattering surface generates linearly polarized radiation at the decoupling epoch ( @xcite ; @xcite , b ; @xcite ; @xcite , b ) , the plane of linear polarization should be rotated to some extent when the cmb radiation propagates through the magnetized intracluster medium at a low redshift .",
    "the great advantage is that , since the cmb polarization field is a continuously varying field on the sky , we can measure an angular profile of the rotation measure in a cluster in principle , which can not be achieved by any other means .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the frequency dependence of the faraday rotation , one will be able to separate this effect from the primary signal and other secondary signals such as that induced by the gravitational lensing effect due to the large - scale structure ( @xcite ) . in this paper , based on the press - schechter theory for the cluster abundance under the cold dark matter ( cdm ) structure formation scenario and a plausible isothermal @xmath0-model of the intracluster gas distribution ,",
    "we compute angular power spectra of the cmb polarization fields including the faraday rotation mixing effect caused by clusters at low redshifts . as for the unknown field configuration ,",
    "we assume the uniform field of @xmath17 strength across a cluster that is consistent with the recent faraday rotation measurements ( clarke et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this model allows us to estimate the impact of this effect in the simplest way .",
    "our study thus proposes a new empirical opportunity to measure or constrain the intracluster magnetic field in the average sense that properties of the magnetic field could be extracted through changes of the statistical quantities , cmb angular power spectra .",
    "so far previous works have focused mainly on investigations of effects of the primordial magnetic fields on the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and see also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "both the amplitudes of the cosmological primordial magnetic field and the mean baryonic density rapidly increase with redshift scaled as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . the dominant contribution to the faraday rotation effect",
    "is therefore imprinted before decoupling ( @xmath20 ) , unless the structure formation at low redshifts causes a significant amplification of the magnetic field .",
    "kosowsky , & loeb ( 1996 ) found that , if the current value of the primordial field is of the order of @xmath21 g on mpc scales corresponding to the microgauss galactic field under the adiabatic compression , the effect on the cmb polarization is potentially measurable by satellite missions _ map _ and _ planck surveyor _ ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also shown that such a stochastic magnetic field in the early universe affects the temperature fluctuations through the induced metric vector perturbations and thus current measurements can put an upper limit of @xmath22 g on the current field amplitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ rm",
    "] we first construct a model to describe the magnetized hot plasma in a cluster by assuming the uniform magnetic field configuration for simplicity .",
    "we then derive the angular power spectrum of the faraday rotation angle based on the press - schechter description of the cluster formation and the @xmath0-model of the gas distribution . in section [ formalism ] , we present a formalism for calculating the angular power spectra of the cmb polarization fields including the faraday rotation mixing effect .",
    "section [ results ] presents the results for the currently favored cdm models . in section [ disc ]",
    "we briefly present the discussions and summary . unless stated explicitly , we assume the favored @xmath5cdm cosmological model with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 as supported from observations of cmb anisotropies and large - scale structure ( e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the present - day density parameters of non - relativistic matter , baryon and the cosmological constant , respectively",
    ", @xmath31 is the hubble parameter and @xmath32 denotes the rms mass fluctuations of a sphere of @xmath33mpc radius .",
    "we also use the @xmath34 unit for the speed of light .",
    "if monochromatic radiation of frequency @xmath35 is passing through a plasma in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath36 along the propagation direction @xmath37 , its linear polarization vector will be rotated through the angle @xmath38 ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the charge and mass of electron , respectively , @xmath42 is the number density field of electron along the line of sight , and @xmath43 is the observed wavelength . note that the factor @xmath44 comes from the relation of @xmath45 and the sign of @xmath38 could be negative depending on the orientation of the magnetic field and the reversal scale of magnetic field .",
    "the equation above clearly shows that the magnitude of the rotation measure depends on the electron number density , the magnetic field strength and the characteristic scale length of the field , and is larger for longer observed wavelengths because of the dependence @xmath46 .",
    "thus , as a possible source of the faraday rotation , in this paper we consider the magnetized hot plasma in clusters of galaxies , motivated by the fact that the deep gravitational potential well of dark matter makes the intracluster gas dense and highly ionized and many observations have revealed the existence of the strong magnetic field with @xmath47 strength(e.g .",
    ", clarke et al . 2001 ) .      to calculate the faraday rotation measure for the magnetized intracluster hot plasma",
    ", we have to assume how the magnetic field is distributed in a cluster along the line of sight .",
    "there are two possibilities considered ; the uniform field configuration and , more realistically , the tangled field , where the former field has constant strength and direction through the entire cluster while the latter field has reversal scales along the line of sight . for the coma cluster , kim et al .",
    "( 1990 ) suggested @xmath48 for the field reversal scale from the observed rotation measures of some sources close in angular position to the cluster , and feretti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) discovered the magnetic field structure with smaller scales down to @xmath49 from the rotation measures of radio halo in the coma , leading to the stronger field of @xmath50 on the scale . on the other hand",
    ", there is observational evidence of coherence of the rotation measures across large radio sources , which indicates that there is at least a field component smoothly distributed across cluster scales of @xmath51 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the magnetic field structure is still unknown because of the lack of the number of sources available per cluster for measuring the magnetic field .",
    "the angular profile of the rotation measure compiled from all sample of radio sources for 16 different normal clusters ( clarke et al .",
    "2001 ) yields the field strengths between @xmath52 and @xmath53 for a uniform field model , while @xmath54 for a simple tangled - cell model with a constant coherence length @xmath55 . in this paper",
    ", we consider a uniform magnetic field model for the sake of revealing the impact of the faraday rotation effect on the cmb polarization in the simplest way .",
    "we then assume that the amplitude of magnetic field at the cluster formation epoch is universally constant , namely it does not depend on redshift ; @xmath56 .",
    "next let us consider a model to describe the gas distribution in a cluster .",
    "motivated by the x - ray observations , we adopt the spherical isothermal @xmath0-model as for the gas density profile of each cluster expressed by @xmath57^{-3\\beta/2 } , \\label{eqn : beta}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the central gas mass density and @xmath59 is the core radius .",
    "the observed values of @xmath0 , obtained from x - ray surface brightness profiles , range from @xmath60 to @xmath61 ( e.g. see @xcite ) . in the following discussion we assume @xmath62 for simplicity . note that makino , sasaki and suto ( 1997 ) showed that the universal density profile of dark matter halo ( @xcite ) can reproduce the @xmath0-model for massive clusters under assumptions of the hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermality . in the spherical collapse model , the virial radius @xmath63 for the halo with mass @xmath64",
    "is obtained from @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the overdensity of collapse and the fitting formula is given by bryan & norman ( 1998 ) , and @xmath67 is the critical matter density at redshift @xmath11 defined by @xmath68 .",
    "once the uniform magnetic field and the gas density profile are given , we can easily calculate the angular profile of the faraday rotation angle for a cluster projected on the sky similarly as the procedure to calculate the profile of the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "using the gas density profile ( [ eqn : beta ] ) and equation ( [ eqn : rm ] ) , the angular profile can be calculated as @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the relative angle between the direction of the magnetic field and the line of sight , @xmath72 is the central number density of electron , and @xmath73 is the angular separation between the line of sight and the cluster center .",
    "the angular core size @xmath74 is related to @xmath59 via @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the angular diameter distance to the cluster at redshift @xmath11 . note that @xmath77 , given as the ratio between the viral and the core radius , is not a parameter but a function of mass @xmath64 and redshift @xmath11 in a general case .",
    "we also have to relate the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath79 to the total mass @xmath64 and redshift @xmath11 . assuming the full ionization for intracluster gas , the central electron number density is given by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the helium mass fraction and we fix @xmath82 in this paper .",
    "it is known that the formation of cluster core regions contains large uncertainties .",
    "we here employ the _ entropy driven _ model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to describe the core radius , motivated by the fact that this model can explain observations such as the x - ray luminosity function better than the simplest self - similar model ( @xcite ) does . in this model",
    "the core is supposed to be in a minimum entropy phase @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the central electron temperature , @xmath85 is the specific heat capacity of the gas at constant volume , and @xmath86 is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume .",
    "if using @xmath87 for @xmath88 , we can obtain @xmath89^{1/2}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\propto & \\frac{t_{e0}^{1/[2(\\gamma-1)]}(m , z)}{\\delta_c^{1/2}(z ) } ( 1+z)^{-3/2 } , \\label{eqn : rcore}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the gas mass fraction for a cluster and we assume that @xmath90 is equal to the cosmological mean ; @xmath91 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the adiabatic index is fixed at @xmath92 throughout this paper .",
    "moreover , we assume the isothermality and that the central electron temperature @xmath84 is equal to the virial temperature @xmath93 given by @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "the quantity @xmath96 is a fudge factor of order unity that should be determined by the efficiency of the shock heating of the gas ( @xcite ) , and we fix @xmath97 . if the proportional constant to calculate @xmath78 in equation ( [ eqn : rcore ] ) is determined by assuming @xmath98 , we can obtain the core radius for an arbitrary cluster with mass @xmath64 and at redshift @xmath11 .",
    "this cluster model then yields @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for @xmath102 at @xmath103 in the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "using these typical values of physical quantities for a cluster with @xmath104 , equation ( [ eqn : angrm ] ) tells us the magnitude of the rotation measure at the cluster center as @xmath105 thus , if the line - of - sight component of the uniform magnetic field has a strength of @xmath106 and we can observe at low frequencies such as @xmath107 , the magnitude of the rotation measure angle could be of the order of @xmath108 for such a massive cluster .",
    "the observed scatter of the normalized rotation measure ( @xmath109 $ ] ) is @xmath110 at the radius in the range of @xmath111 from the cluster center ( kim et al .",
    "1991 ; clarke et al .",
    "the value estimated in equation ( [ eqn : orderest ] ) corresponds to @xmath112 at the cluster center for the typical case of @xmath113 .",
    "our model thus seems consistent with the observations .",
    "this can be more quantitatively verified as follows .",
    "using our model of the rotation measure angle ( [ eqn : angrm ] ) and the press - schechter mass function @xmath114 ( @xcite ) ( see equation ( [ eqn : ps ] ) ) , we can compute the variance of the rotation measure for present - day clusters against the radius from the cluster center : @xmath115 ^ 2\\right/ \\int^{m_{\\rm max}}_{m_{\\rm min}}\\!\\!dm\\frac{dn}{dm}. \\label{eqn : averm}\\ ] ] in the calculation of the equation above , we use @xmath116 for the ensemble average of angle @xmath71 between the magnetic field direction and the line of sight , since the field orientation is considered to be random for each cluster . the solid line in figure [ fig : averm ]",
    "shows the average profile @xmath117 for @xmath118 in the mass range of @xmath119 .",
    "note that this mass range corresponds to @xmath120 for the @xmath121-ray luminosity in the rosat @xmath122 band , where only the thermal bremsstrahlung emission is considered .",
    "thus , this @xmath121-ray luminosity range is roughly consistent with the rosat sample of the faraday rotation measurements used by clarke et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . for comparison ,",
    "square symbols represent the observational data from clarke et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with @xmath123 errors arising from the faraday contributions due to our galaxy .",
    "it is clear that our model with @xmath118 can roughly reproduce the observed magnitude and dispersion of the rotation measures as a function of the radius . in this sense",
    ", it is likely that we can at least estimate a correct magnitude of the faraday rotation effect on the angular power spectra of cmb polarization fields , even though the uniform magnetic field is an unrealistic model , because the contribution to the angular power spectra comes from the second moments of the rotation measure angle by definition ( see equation ( [ eqn : rmclb ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore , there could be an uncertain selection effect in the observational data .",
    "for example , one cluster sample with the large rm value of @xmath124 at the radius of @xmath125 has the @xmath121-ray luminosity of @xmath126 or the mass of @xmath127 , which is smaller than the lowest mass of @xmath128 used for the theoretical prediction shown by the solid line . to illustrate the sensitivity of the lowest mass to the theoretical prediction",
    ", the dashed line in figure [ fig : averm ] shows the result of equation ( [ eqn : averm ] ) for @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) and @xmath131 , and it clearly underestimates the observational result . for the similar reason ,",
    "it is thought that clarke et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derived a higher value of @xmath132 for the uniform magnetic field model from their observational data .",
    "in addition to these facts , there is possible contamination of line emissions from the intracluster metal to the observed @xmath121-ray luminosity .",
    "therefore , our model of @xmath133 often used in the following discussion could lead to the minimum magnitude of the faraday rotation effect on the cmb polarization power spectra for a realistic effect .    as will be shown in detail ,",
    "the faraday rotation effect generates secondary patterns of the cmb polarizations expressed as @xmath134 and @xmath135 in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are those parameters of the primary polarization generated via thomson scattering at the decoupling ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "hence , equation ( [ eqn : orderest ] ) implies that , if we observe the cmb polarization through a cluster at longer wavelengths such as @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , the secondary signals could be comparable to the primary signals for massive clusters with @xmath143 . in this case , we could directly measure the faraday rotation effect in an individual cluster like the sz effect on the cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "this would be also true for particular clusters that have an unusual stronger magnetic field such as @xmath144 .",
    "moreover , since the primary cmb polarization field has very smooth structure on angular scales of @xmath145 because of the silk damping ( @xcite ; and also see @xcite in more detail ) , the angular profile of the rotation measure could be directly reconstructed in principle from the secondary signals generated on small scales even for a single observed frequency .",
    "these interesting possibilities are now being investigated in detail , and the results will be presented elsewhere ( ohno et al .",
    "2001 in preparation ) .",
    "we are interested in the secondary effect on the angular power spectra of the cmb polarization due to the faraday rotation effect caused by clusters .",
    "we thus need to compute the angular power spectrum of the rotation measure angle @xmath146 , which gives the strength of @xmath38 in the average sense for the all - sky survey at two - point statistics level .",
    "the angular fourier transformation of the rotation measure ( [ eqn : angrm ] ) is given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 , @xmath149 is the zero - th order bessel function , and we have used the small - angle approximation ( bond & efstathiou 1987 ) .",
    "since clusters are discrete sources , contributions to the power spectrum of the rotation measure are divided into the poissonian contribution , @xmath150 , and the contribution from the spatial correlation between clusters , @xmath151 ( peebles 1980 ) . from equation ( [ eqn : angrm ] )",
    "the correlation contribution @xmath151 depends on the ensemble average @xmath152 , where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the relative angles between the magnetic fields and the line of sights for those two clusters , respectively , while @xmath150 depends on @xmath155 , leading to the non - vanishing contribution for any distribution of @xmath71 .",
    "if the origin of the magnetic field is primordial , the correlation between two intracluster magnetic fields could be non - vanishing even on separation scales between clusters like that between the density fluctuation fields , and in this case we have some contribution from @xmath151 because @xmath156 .",
    "however , it is known that the poissonian contribution always dominates the correlation one because clusters are rare objects ( @xcite ) . for this reason ,",
    "we here assume @xmath157 and consider only the poisson contribution @xmath150 for simplicity . following the method developed by cole & kaiser ( 1988 ) and limber s equation , we can obtain an integral expression of @xmath151 ; @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the comoving volume and the comoving distance , respectively , and @xmath161 is the comoving number density for halos with mass in the range of @xmath64 and @xmath162 at redshift @xmath11 .",
    "we compute @xmath114 using the press - schechter model ( @xcite ) , and in this case we have @xmath163 where @xmath164 denotes the threshold , @xmath165 is the present - day rms mass fluctuation within the top - hat filter corresponding to the mass scale of @xmath64 , @xmath166 is the threshold overdensity of the spherical collapse model , and @xmath167 is the linear growth factor of density fluctuations .",
    "figure [ fig : clrm ] shows the angular power spectra of the rotation measure through clusters for @xmath168 ( solid line ) and @xmath6 ( dashed ) assuming the observed frequency of @xmath169 in the @xmath5cdm model . note that we have again used @xmath116 .",
    "we have confirmed that dominant contribution to the power spectrum comes from the massive clusters with mass larger than @xmath170 at low redshifts such as @xmath171 , similarly as the results of sz effect due to clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we develop a formalism for calculating the secondary faraday rotation effect induced by magnetized intracluster hot plasma on the cmb polarization fields and their angular power spectra .",
    "the properties of cmb polarization fields can be described in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( @xcite ; @xcite , b ; @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider quasi - monochromatic waves propagating in the z - direction , in which the electric and magnetic fields vibrate on the @xmath172-@xmath173 plane .",
    "we can then express the electric field @xmath174 in terms of the complex orthogonal unit vectors of circularly polarized waves as @xmath175 , where @xmath176 and @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the unit vectors of right - hand and left - hand polarized waves , respectively . using those quantities , the stokes parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 measured in the fixed @xmath179-coordinates",

    "equation ( [ eqn : boltz ] ) clearly shows that the faraday rotation causes the mixing between @xmath136- and @xmath137-type polarizations . more importantly , even if the primary cmb anisotropies generate only the @xmath136-type polarization in the statistical sense ( @xcite ) , the faraday rotation mixing induces the @xmath137-type polarization on the observed sky from the primary @xmath136 mode .",
    "since we are interested in the secondary effect on the cmb polarizations , the solutions of equation ( [ eqn : boltz ] ) for @xmath136 and @xmath137 along the line of sight with direction of @xmath186 can be approximately solved up to the first order of @xmath184 as @xmath187 where @xmath139 and @xmath138 denote the primary @xmath137- and @xmath136-polarization fluctuations generated at the decoupling epoch ( @xmath140 ) , respectively , and we have neglected other secondary polarization fields generated at low redshifts that have insignificant power compared to the primary signal on relevant angular scales for a realistic reionization history ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the cosmic time at the decoupling and the present time , respectively . in",
    "what follows quantities with tilde symbol denote quantities at @xmath188 .    the stokes parameters @xmath136 and",
    "@xmath137 depend on the choice of coordinates and are not invariant under the coordinate rotation .",
    "for this reason , it is useful to introduce the new bases of rotationally invariant polarization fields , called the parity - even electric mode ( @xmath2 ) and the parity - odd magnetic mode ( @xmath1 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite , b ; @xcite , b ) .",
    "any polarization pattern on the sky can be decomposed into these modes .",
    "since the secondary effect due to clusters of galaxies on the cmb polarization is important only on small angular scales such as @xmath190 , we can safely employ the small - angle approximation ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on these considerations , @xmath136 and @xmath137 fields can be expressed using the two - dimensional fourier transformation in terms of the electric and magnetic modes as @xmath191e^{i{\\mbox{\\boldmath$l$}}\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}},\\nonumber\\\\ u({\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}})&=&\\int\\!\\!\\frac{d^2{\\mbox{\\boldmath$l$}}}{(2\\pi)^2 } \\left[e_{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$l$}}}\\sin2\\phi_{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$l$}}}+b_{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$l$}}}\\cos2\\phi_{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$l$}}}\\right]e^{i{\\mbox{\\boldmath$l$ } } \\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath192 is defined by @xmath193 , and @xmath194 and @xmath195 are the two - dimensional fourier coefficients for the @xmath2- and @xmath1-modes , respectively .",

    "we ignore the primary @xmath1-mode power spectrum for simplicity ; @xmath202 .    from equation ( [ eqn : magpol ] )",
    "the two - point correlation functions of @xmath136 and @xmath137 fields including the faraday rotation mixing effect can be computed as @xmath203 with @xmath204 where we have employed a reasonable assumption that the primary fields ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) on the last scattering surface and the rotation measure field @xmath184 induced by low-@xmath11 clusters are statistically uncorrelated .",

    "figure [ fig : window ] shows the window functions of @xmath1- and @xmath2-modes per logarithmic interval in @xmath55 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 , for a given mode @xmath218 as derived by equation ( [ eqn : window ] ) .",
    "we consider the magnetic field strength @xmath168 and the observed frequency @xmath107 in the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "one can see that the window functions for the mixing between @xmath2 and @xmath1 modes are well localized in @xmath55 space .    in figure",
    "[ fig : clpol ] we show the angular power spectra of @xmath2- and @xmath1-mode polarizations on the observed sky including the faraday rotation mixing effect due to clusters for the observed frequency of @xmath219 .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the @xmath1-mode spectrum for @xmath220 that corresponds to the value estimated from the observational data for a model of uniform intracluster magnetic field ( clarke et al .",
    "2001 ) , while the dotted line shows the result of @xmath118 . for comparison , the @xmath2-mode power spectra with and without the secondary effect of @xmath118",
    "are also shown by solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "one can readily see that the generated @xmath1-mode power spectrum has a peak with magnitude of @xmath221 at @xmath4 . on smaller scales of @xmath222 ,",
    "the spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath1 modes coincide , and this is similar as the secondary effects caused by the peculiar velocity field of the ionized medium in the reionized universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these results imply that , if the uniform magnetic field has a strength of @xmath223 and we can observe at lower frequencies such as @xmath7 , the magnitude of @xmath1-mode could be comparable with the primary polarization amplitude of @xmath224 .",
    "the detectability of the induced @xmath1 mode polarization by the sensitive satellite mission planck can be estimated following the method developed by zaldarriaga & seljak ( 1998 ) .",
    "the relative error on the overall amplitude of the induced @xmath1 component @xmath0 can be estimated as @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the fraction of observed sky and we here fix @xmath227 . as for the detector noise and the beam width ,",
    "we assume @xmath228 and @xmath229 for the @xmath230ghz channel on planck , where @xmath231 is the full - width at half - maximum angle .",
    "note that the @xmath230ghz channel we here consider is the lowest frequency channel on planck . from the dependence @xmath232 of the rotation measure , the magnitude of the @xmath1-mode angular power spectrum at @xmath230ghz becomes smaller by @xmath233 than the results estimated in figure [ fig : clpol ] .",
    "accordingly , for the magnetic field of @xmath168 , we have @xmath234 .",
    "this means that this effect can not be detected by the planck mission for @xmath118 .",
    "conversely , to get @xmath235 at the @xmath230ghz channel , the uniform magnetic field component must have @xmath236 strength , and this seems an unrealistic value . however , we stress that even a null detection of this effect can set a new constraint on the magnetic field strength .",
    "it is also worth noting that this signal would be detected more effectively by a ground based experiments at lower frequency bands such as @xmath237 observing a small patch of the sky for a sufficiently long integration time to reduce the noise per pixel .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the secondary effect on the cmb polarization fields induced by the faraday rotation effect of the magnetic field in an intracluster hot plasma at a low redshift . to illustrate the impact of this effect in the simplest way , we employed the simple model that the magnetic field has a uniform field strength such as @xmath238 across a cluster universally when the cluster formed , which is consistent with observations of the rotation measures in clusters ( clarke et al .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : averm ] , our model can roughly reproduce the observed scatter of the rotation measures as a function of the distance from the cluster center ( kim et al .",
    "1991 ; clarke et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this sense , since the faraday rotation effect on the angular power spectra of cmb polarizations comes from the second moments of the rotation measure angle ( see equation ( [ eqn : rmclb ] ) ) , it is likely that our model can at least estimate a correct magnitude of the effect , even though detailed shapes of those spectra could be different for a realistic intracluster magnetic field as discussed below .",
    "we showed that the parity - odd @xmath1-mode angular power spectrum is generated on the observed sky by the faraday rotation mixing effect as a new qualitative feature , when if the primary cmb anisotropies includes the parity - even @xmath2-mode only such as predicted by the standard inflation - motivated scenarios with pure primordial scalar perturbations .",
    "we estimated that the generated @xmath1-mode power spectrum has a peak with amplitude of @xmath239 at @xmath4 under the plausible scenario of the cluster formation in the currently favored @xmath5cdm model .",
    "it was also shown that the lowest frequency @xmath240 channel of planck can be used to set an upper limit of @xmath241 for a uniform component of the intracluster magnetic field .",
    "detection or even null detection of the predicted @xmath1-type polarization will therefore be a new empirical tool to provide a calibration of an uncertain magnetic field in a cluster , combined with measurements of the gas distribution from the x - ray or sz datasince .",
    "it is known that there are other secondary sources on the cmb polarization fields caused in the low redshift universe , and these nonlinear effects generally induce the @xmath1-type polarization pattern from the coupling with the primary @xmath2-mode .",
    "the main source is the gravitational lensing effect of the large - scale structure , leading to the @xmath1-type polarization that has a peak of @xmath242 at @xmath4 and then a power of @xmath243 at @xmath244 for the simliar @xmath5cdm model as considered in this paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of authors ( n.s . )",
    "has quantitatvely shown that the secondary effect due to the peculiar motion of ionized medium in the large - scale structure also generates the @xmath1-mode polarization with @xmath245 at @xmath246 for a realistic patchy reionization model of the universe ( @xcite ) . from these results , if the uniform magnetic field has a larger strength of @xmath247 as a common feature of clusters and we observe at lower frequencies such as @xmath7 , the generated @xmath1-mode amplitude due to the faraday rotation effect would be comparable with the primary polarization amplitude and larger than the other secondary signals at @xmath248 , although observations at such low frequencies would suffer from large foreground contamination of the syncrhrotron radiation from our galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "even if the uniform magnetic field is not as strong as @xmath6 , the sensitive multi low - frequency measurements will allow one to separate this signal from primary and those other secondary signals in principle thanks to the frequency dependence of @xmath249 on @xmath209 , which is analogous to measurements of secondary temperature fluctuations by the sz effect .",
    "there are possible contributions to affect our results that we have ignored in this paper .",
    "the intracluster tangled magnetic fields , as implied by the rotation measures of some sources inside the coma cluster ( @xcite ) , would provide contributions to our results in addition to the contribution due to the uniform field . however , the coherent scale of tangled fields in a cluster is still unknown .",
    "the recent complete measurements of the rotation measures ( clarke et al . 2001 ) imply the @xmath250 strength of the tangled field under the assumption of the coherent scale of @xmath251 .",
    "it is also known that the strong radio halos embedded within a ( cooling flow ) cluster are pervaded by stronger magnetic fields on smaller scales such as @xmath252 for hydra a ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the simplest tangled - cell model with a constant coherence length @xmath55 has often been considered in the literature , the possible important mechanism to affect our results is the deporlarization effect ( @xcite ) , leading to the cancellations to some extent between the faraday rotations in independent cells with random orientations of the magnetic fields within a cluster .",
    "the finite beam size will also lead to the artificial cancellations between the faraday rotations of cells covered within one beam . from these considerations , the depolarization effect may lead to an intuitive result that a feature of the @xmath1-mode spectrum can be sensitive to the characteristic angular scale , @xmath253 , originating from the coherent length .",
    "this investigation is now in progress , and will be presented elsewhere ( ohno et al .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that outflow or jet acitivities of quasars or black holes leave behind an expanding magnetized bubble in the itergalactic medium ( igm ) resulting in the possibility that the igm is filled by magnetic fields to some extent ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "even thgouh the igm field has a smaller strength than @xmath254 on @xmath255 scales , a large volume coverage of the ionized plasma might lead to non - negligible contribution connected to the reionization history of the universe .    finally , we comment on implications of our results to the nonthermal processes in a cluster",
    ". the observations of diffuse synchrotron halos and nonthermal hard x - ray emission have implied the existence of nonthermal relativistic electrons in a cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these electrons are produced by the shock acceleration in an intracluster medium , and it will allow us to derive additional information on the physical conditions of the intracluster medium environment , which can not be obtained from the thermal plasma emission only .",
    "the intracluster magnetic field should then play an important role to these nonthermal processes .",
    "in particular , it is being recognized that the nonthermal process can be a unique probe of measuring the dynamically forming clusters before thermalization of the intracluster gas .",
    "recently , waxman & loeb ( 2000 ) pointed out that the synchrotron radiation from those forming clusters could be foreground sources of the cmb temperature fluctuations at low frequency observations such as @xmath256",
    ". those clusters could also produce the high energy gamma ray emission through the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by relativistic electrons and thus be identified as _ gamma ray clusters _ by the future sensitive telescope _ glast _",
    ", which are difficult to detect by x - ray or optical surveys because of their extended angular size of about @xmath257 ( @xcite ) . based on these ideas , it will be very interesting to investigate cross - correlations between the synchrotron radiation or the gamma ray sources and the faraday rotation signal in cmb polarization map .",
