    "two of these six fermi points , referred to as @xmath6and @xmath7 points , are inequivalent and the quasiparticle excitations about them obey linear dirac - like energy dispersion @xcite .",
    "the presence of such dirac - like quasiparticles leads to a number of unusual electronic properties in graphene including relativistic quantum hall effect with unusual structure of hall plateaus @xcite , which has been verified in experiments @xcite .",

    "another interesting consequences of the existence dirac - like quasiparticles can be understood by studying superconductivity in graphene .",
    "it has been suggested that superconductivity can be induced in a graphene layer in the presence of a superconducting electrode near it via proximity effect @xcite or by intercalating it with metallic atoms @xcite .",

    "we find that in this limit , the oscillatory behavior of josephson current can be understood as a consequence of transmission resonance phenomenon of dirac - bogoliubov - de gennes ( dbdg ) quasiparticles in graphene .",
