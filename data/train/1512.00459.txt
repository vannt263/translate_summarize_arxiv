    "the metallicity of a galaxy correlates with stellar mass over a range from 10@xmath1 to 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 , recognized as the mass - metallicity relation ( @xmath4 relation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while star formation is responsible for the build - up of metals in a galaxy , measured abundances account for significantly fewer metals in galaxies than expected based on quantified star formation histories ( sfhs ) and nucleosynthesis yields , particularly at lower masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the paucity of metals is generally attributed to three different mechanisms : ( i ) variations and uncertainties in nucleosynthesis yields , ( ii ) the dilution of the gas - phase metallicity due to the infall of pristine gas from the outer disk or local extragalactic environment , and/or ( iii ) the removal of metals through supernova - driven galactic winds .",
    "the latter process is the favored explanation of the low - metallicity measurements in dwarf galaxies as the efficiency of the process is predicted to increase with decreasing galaxy mass .",
    "there have been numerous models quantifying the mass - loss process due to stellar feedback in low - mass systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the prescriptions and details of the models vary , but the premises and overall results are the same : the mechanical luminosity of supernovae , particularly if the supernovae are somewhat spatially and temporally co - located , can evacuate metals from a galaxy while retaining ambient gas .",
    "generally , the metals produced both by the supernovae progenitors and by the supernova process itself are accelerated through the lower - density shocked gas cavity surrounding the supernova .",
    "the metals maintain velocities high enough to be pushed out of the host galaxy .",
    "in contrast , the ambient gas is denser and cooler , requiring more energy to be accelerated to escape speeds and , thus , remains bound .",
    "two of the seminal works on this process @xcite modeled galaxies with gas masses between @xmath5 m@xmath3@xmath6 m@xmath3  and found that in this mass range , supernovae were highly efficient in expelling enriched material from a galaxy - either in blow - outs where the bulk of the gas is still bound and may eventually return to the galaxy , or in blow - aways where the bulk of the gas is unbound .",
    "these simulations predict that systems massive enough to retain a gaseous disk above a `` threshold '' gas mass of @xmath5 m@xmath3  will also have a massive enough dark matter halo to retain a minimum amount of metals , which places a predicted lower limit on the oxygen abundance to be @xmath7 . in the context of chemical evolution ,",
    "the simulations simplify the analysis as they are able to study a theoretical , isolated , low - mass system without considering environmental effects such as tidal interactions , ram pressure stripping , or gas in - fall .    testing",
    "the prediction of how many metals may be expelled due to stellar feedback in this low - mass regime has proven difficult . despite the expectation that low - mass , low - luminosity dwarfs should be the most numerous type of galaxy",
    ", there is a bias against detecting such faint systems . compounding the problem ,",
    "gas - rich star - forming galaxies are preferentially located outside of group environments , making detection even more challenging at the larger implied distances . within the local group , two star - forming galaxies with a gas mass below the `` threshold '' mass of @xmath5 m@xmath3",
    "have been cataloged ( lgs  3 and leo  t , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , while spectroscopic measurements of leo  t s stars have been obtained @xcite , neither lgs  3 nor leo  t host an hii  region .",
    "thus , the gas - phase metallicity in both galaxies is unknown and it is not possible to measure the amount of oxygen retained in the interstellar medium in either system .",
    "@xcite have studied gas - poor milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) in this context .",
    "detailed spectroscopic stellar abundance measurements and star formation history studies of these systems show that the metallicity distribution functions are consistent with the removal of 96% @xmath899% of the metals . @xcite attributed the nearly complete loss of metals to stellar feedback . yet , given the observational evidence for a morphology - density relation , environmental processes may play a role in the removal of gas and its associated metals .",
    "through the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an isolated , gas - rich , very low mass galaxy , leo  p ( @xmath9 m@xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , was discovered @xcite just outside the zero velocity boundary of the local group @xcite .",
    "the galaxy has on - going star formation , an hii  region @xcite , and one of the lowest gas - phase oxygen abundances ever measured ( @xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the oxygen abundance is comparable to that of ddo  68 and i  zw  18 , unlike these other galaxies , leo  p shows no signs of interaction or gas infall @xcite that could dilute the metallicity",
    "instead , leo  p lies on an extension of the @xmath4 relation to very low luminosities @xcite .",
    "all indications suggest that the evolution of leo  p is dominated by internal processes , not external events . the serendipitous combination of isolation , relative proximity , gas content , star - forming properties , and the single hii  region , makes leo  p an ideal system in which to test predictions as to whether or not supernovae can expel nearly all the metals from a galaxy in this very low - mass regime .",
    "we present an oxygen budget for leo  p , comparing the amount of oxygen produced by star formation over the lifetime of the galaxy with the mass of oxygen currently contained in the gas and stars .",
    "we discuss the deficit in oxygen in leo  p based on this accounting and the implications for metal - loss in low - mass galaxies due to star formation feedback versus other mechanisms .",
    ".properties of leo  p [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]      the oxygen locked in the stars can be estimated using the sfr(t ) and metallicity evolution derived from the cmd fitting results ( see figure  [ fig : sfh_metals ] ) . in the absence of stellar spectroscopic measurements , this technique provides an alternative independent approach to estimating the oxygen content in the stars . assuming an solar oxygen abundance of @xmath11log(o / h ) @xmath12 @xcite",
    ", we multiply the oxygen enrichment as a function of time by the mass of stars formed over each time period , and assume an oxygen recycling fraction ( r ) of 30% :    @xmath13    where : @xmath14    assuming x and y to be 75% and 25% respectively and the chemical evolution history from figure  [ fig : sfh_metals ] , this yields an estimate of the total mass of oxygen locked in stars to be @xmath15 m@xmath3 . accounting for the distribution of mass between the gas and the stars ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath16 to @xmath17 is @xmath18 . in other words , there are twice as many o atoms in the gas per unit mass than in the stars .",
    "the total oxygen produced by star formation is significantly greater than the combined mass of oxygen in the gas and stars .",
    "the deficit in oxygen can be found by the simple calculation :    @xmath19    which is @xmath20 m@xmath3 .",
    "systematic uncertainties were measured via monte carlo simulations by varying the observed cmd in both luminosity and temperature , and re - solving for the amount of o lost . including these uncertainties",
    ", we find @xmath21% of the oxygen has been expelled from the galaxy .",
    "the final numbers are listed in table  [ tab : o_balance ] . the same calculations performed using the padova and basti models both yield values of 95@xmath22% for the fractional loss of o , consistent with our adopted value from the parsec models .",
    "based on the sfh , chemical evolution history , and gas - phase oxygen abundance measurements , we have estimated that leo  p has lost 95% of its oxygen .",
    "the retention of 5% is still consistent with the almost total lack of chemical enrichment implied from the three sfh solutions . comparing the relative amounts of oxygen in the stellar and gas phases to that produced by star formation implies that one quarter of the oxygen retained is locked in the stars , while three quarters is retained in the gas .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of performing an inventory of oxygen in this low - mass regime in a galaxy that has not had its gas content removed .",
    "figure  [ fig : percent_lost ] presents a comparison of the percentage of o lost in leo  p compared with the percentages of four other metal species lost from similarly low mass dsphs ( ursa minor , canes venetici  i , sextans ; * ? ? ?",
    "as seen in the figure , leo  p has retained a larger fraction of metals than these dsphs . presumably due to its isolation ,",
    "leo  p has retained a significant amount of gas and , thus , retained a larger fraction of metals . indeed ,",
    "three quarters of the o content in leo  p is in the gas .",
    "note that considering only the oxygen locked up in stars in leo  p yields a loss fraction of @xmath23% , consistent with the results for the dsphs . if the dsphs lost a significant amount of their gas due to tidal and/or ram pressure stripping , including the metals present in the gas at the time of removal , then the estimates from @xcite represent upper limits to the metals lost due to stellar feedback .",
    "that is , calculations which do not take into consideration the retention of metals in the gas phase will underestimate the ability of dwarf galaxies to retain metals .    also note in figure  [ fig : percent_lost ] that the percentage of mg lost is different from the other alpha elements , si and ca ; for a constant imf , these elements are produced at a constant ratio , and presumably would be evacuated from the galaxies by the same processes ( i.e. , galactic outflows and stripping mechanisms ) .",
    "while we highlight only three dwarf satellites that are of similar stellar mass to leo  p , we note that this trend is seen in the larger sample of galaxies in @xcite .",
    "it is not clear why mg has a different retention fraction .",
    "the models of @xcite and @xcite predict that below @xmath24 m@xmath3 , the metal ejection efficiency reaches 100% across the entire range probed of mechanical luminosities due to stellar feedback .",
    "however , as noted in these studies , the simulations were designed with extreme conditions . the energy from supernovae",
    "is assumed to be injected _ instantaneously _ into the interstellar medium in the central 100 pc of a galaxy .",
    "stellar feedback occurring on such a short timescale and confined to such a small spatial region would be more effective at driving outflows in a low - mass galaxy than in more realistic conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in leo  p ,",
    "the star formation occurs over extended periods of time and is distributed across the galaxy .",
    "the oxygen retained in leo  p is what may be expected without the a priori temporal and spatial star formation assumptions .",
    "leo  p allows a direct measure of the role supernovae play in determining the metallicity of a galaxy below the gas mass threshold of @xmath5 m@xmath3 .",
    "the low oxygen abundance in the present day ism of leo p can be explained by a range of different chemical evolution histories , including ones that include dilution by gas accretion at early times .",
    "however , because we account for the total mass of oxygen produced versus the amount in the gas and stars , the missing 95% of oxygen atoms can not be explained by dilution .",
    "this supports the results from @xcite who concluded that the low metallicity was likely not due to the infall of pristine gas based on the relatively ordered hi  kinematics .",
    "note also that @xcite estimate that the ratio of total mass to baryonic mass in leo  p is @xmath25 15:1 .",
    "since this is only twice the universal dark matter to baryonic matter ratio , this means that leo  p has lost , at most , only half of its baryons to processes like supernova feedback .",
    "the 5% of oxygen retained in leo  p is considerably lower than estimates of @xmath0% of metals retained in more massive galaxies ( @xmath26 m@xmath3@xmath27 m@xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the expected result that the retention fraction of metals decreases with decreasing mass for lower mass galaxies .",
    "while stellar feedback is likely responsible for the paucity of metals in leo  p , it is still speculative whether the missing oxygen atoms have escaped the potential well of the galaxy completely or if they reside in a halo of hot coronal gas .",
    "as more measurements become available , we will be able to better quantify the fraction of metals and gas lost due to star formation as a function of galaxy mass .",
