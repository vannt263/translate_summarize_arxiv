    "let @xmath0 be a locally finite affine building with a cocompact automorphism group , and @xmath5 be a lattice .",
    "the goal of this work is to address the following question : when does @xmath3 admit a faithful finite - dimensional linear representations over a field , or more generally over a commutative ring with unity ?",
    "a group admitting such a representation is called * linear*.    let us review some known facts concerning that question .",
    "the most important locally finite affine buildings are the so - called * bruhat  tits buildings*. such a building @xmath0 is associated with a semi - simple algebraic group @xmath6 over a local field @xmath7 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath0 coincides with the @xmath7-rank of @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath6 is @xmath7-simple , the building @xmath0 is irreducible . in that case , if we assume moreover that @xmath8 , celebrated theorems by margulis and venkatarmana ensure that lattices in @xmath9 are all arithmetic .",
    "it is tempting to deduce that lattices in bruhat  tits buildings of dimension  @xmath1 are classified , but this is actually not the case . indeed , the full automorphism group of the bruhat ",
    "tits building @xmath0 of @xmath9 is isomorphic to @xmath10 ( assuming that the @xmath7-rank of @xmath6 is  @xmath1 ) , which is an extension of the group @xmath11 of algebraic automorphisms over @xmath7 by a subgroup @xmath12 ( see @xcite and proposition  [ prop : aut ] below ) .",
    "as long as @xmath12 is infinite  which happens if and only if the local field @xmath7 is of positive characteristic  a lattice in @xmath13 can potentially have infinite image in @xmath12 and , hence , fail to satisfy the hypotheses of the arithmeticity theorem . a lattice in @xmath13 with infinite image in @xmath12 will be called a * galois lattice*. galois lattices exist in rank one ( see proposition  [ prop : rankonegaloislattice ] below ) , while their existence in higher rank is an open question at the time of writing .    by the seminal work of tits ( see the last corollary in @xcite ) , irreducible locally finite affine building of dimension  @xmath14 are all bruhat  tits buildings of simple algebraic groups over local fields .",
    "this is not the case in low dimension .    if @xmath15 , namely if @xmath0 is a tree with vertex degrees  @xmath1 , any uniform lattice in @xmath13 is linear , indeed virtually free .",
    "however , a non - uniform lattice can be non - linear .    if @xmath16 and @xmath0 is reducible , then @xmath0 is the product of two trees . in that case burger and",
    "mozes @xcite constructed celebrated examples of uniform lattices @xmath5 that are simple groups , and can thus not be linear since they fail to be residually finite .",
    "it is still unknown whether an irreducible lattice in a product of more than two topologically simple groups , each acting cocompactly on a tree , can be non - linear .    if @xmath16 and @xmath0 is irreducible , but not bruhat  tits , then we say that @xmath0 is * exotic*. some of the known constructions of exotic affine buildings and lattices acting on them are referenced in ",
    "[ sec : reviewexotic ] below .",
    "the simplest case of exotic affine buildings , which has been the most studied so far and will be of core interest in this paper , is that of buildings of type @xmath17 .",
    "let us recall that ( locally finite ) @xmath17-buildings may be characterized among simply connected @xmath18-dimensional simplicial complexes by the property that the link of every vertex is the incidence graph of a ( finite ) projective plane ; this follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.3 ) . from the classification",
    ", it follows that the locally finite bruhat ",
    "tits buildings of type @xmath17 are precisely those associated with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a finite dimensional division algebra over a local field @xmath7 .",
    "thus a locally finite @xmath4-building is exotic if and only if it is not isomorphic to the bruhat",
    " tits building of such a group @xmath19 .    our first main result , whose proof occupies the major part of this paper , is the following .",

    "assume that @xmath0 is not isomorphic to the building associated to @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a finite dimensional division algebra over a local field .",
    "then , for any commutative ring @xmath21 with unity and any @xmath22 , any homomorphism @xmath23 has a finite image .    in appendix  [ app : galois ] , we shall also establish a similar result for galois lattices in arbitrary bruhat  tits buildings of dimension  @xmath1 .",
    "[ thm : nonlineargalois ] let @xmath6 be a @xmath7-simple algebraic group defined over a local field @xmath7 , of @xmath7-rank  @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a lattice in @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath3 has infinite image in @xmath24 , then for any commutative unital ring @xmath21 and any any @xmath25 , any homomorphism @xmath23 has a finite image .",
    "combining these two results with the aforementioned arithmeticity theorem , we draw the following consequence .",
    "[ cor : equiv ] let @xmath0 be a locally finite @xmath4-building and @xmath26 be a discrete group acting cocompactly .",
    "then @xmath3 admits a representation with infinite image of dimension  @xmath25 over a commutative unital ring if and only if @xmath0 is bruhat  tits and @xmath3 is arithmetic .",
    "we mention that by an unpublished work of yehuda shalom and tim steger we know that every proper normal subgroup of a lattice in an @xmath17-building is of finite index . clearly",
    "if the lattice is linear then finite index normal subgroups are in abundance .",
    "the question of finding finite quotients of lattices in possibly exotic affine buildings was already asked by w. kantor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem  c.6.2 ) .",
    "some computer experiments we held indicate that some non - linear lattices might have no normal subgroups at all .",
    "we suggest the following .",
    "[ conj : simplicity ]",
    "let @xmath0 be an affine building of type @xmath4 .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is not isomorphic to the building associated to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a finite dimensional division algebra over a local field .",
    "let @xmath3 be a lattice in @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath3 is virtually simple .",
    "it should be emphasized that , while there are several known constructions of locally finite @xmath4-buildings with lattices , it is generally a delicate problem to determine whether or not a given such building arising from one of those constructions is bruhat  tits . actually , until now , the only examples that could be proved to be exotic are buildings of thickness  @xmath27 , and in most cases the proof of exoticity relied on computer calculations . as an application of theorem  [ nonlinear ] , presented in appendix  [ app : exoticlargeorder ]",
    ", we will establish an exoticity criterion for a large concrete family of @xmath4-lattices which was first defined by ronan  @xcite and kantor  @xcite and more recently investigated by essert @xcite . in particular , we obtain the first infinite family of @xmath4-lattices in exotic buildings of arbitrarily large thickness ( see corollary  [ cor : existenceexotic ] ) , and provide a partial answer to a question of w.  kantor , who wrote in the remarks following corollary  c.3.2 in @xcite : `` _ _ it would be very interesting to know which , if any , of these buildings are `` classical '' ones obtained from @xmath28 for complete local ( skew ) fields @xmath29__. ''      the proofs of both theorems  [ nonlinear ] and  [ thm : nonlineargalois ] establish the contrapositive assertion , and thus start by assuming that the lattice @xmath3 has a linear representation with infinite image over a ring .    the first step of the proof is a reduction showing that the given representation can be assumed to range in a @xmath7-simple algebraic group @xmath6 over a local field @xmath7 , with an unbounded and zariski dense image .",
    "that step is actually a consequence of an abstract statement of independent interest , valid at a high level of generality , and presented in appendix  [ app : ringlinear ] .    at that stage ,",
    "the proof of theorem  [ nonlinear ] reduces to that of the following .",
    "[ thm : nonlinear - local ] let @xmath0 be a locally finite @xmath4-building and @xmath5 a discrete group acting cocompactly .",
    "assume that there exist a local field @xmath7 , a connected adjoint @xmath7-simple @xmath7-algebraic group @xmath30 and a group homomorphism @xmath31 with an unbounded and zariski dense image .",
    "then @xmath0 is a bruhat  tits building .    our strategy to approach theorem  [ thm : nonlinear - local ]",
    "is inspired by the recent proof of the margulis superrigidity theorem by the first author and a.  furman , developed in @xcite .",
    "the tools developed in that work are designed to study a representation @xmath32 of an arbitrary countable group @xmath3 to @xmath7-simple algebraic group over a local field @xmath7 , with zariski dense image .",
    "a key notion from @xcite is that of a * gate * ( see  [ sub : bf ] below for more details ) .",
    "this gate is an algebraic variety canonically associated with any standard borel space @xmath33 equipped with a measure - class preserving ergodic action of @xmath3 .",
    "the gate moreover provides a natural representation from @xmath34 to a subquotient of the algebraic group @xmath35 , which is non - trivial under suitable assumptions on @xmath3 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , in order to prove theorem  [ thm : nonlinear - local ] , we need to provide an ergodic @xmath3-space @xmath33 such that @xmath36 does not admit any non - trivial representation .",
    "the space @xmath33 we shall construct will be called the * singular cartan flow*. in order to give a better understanding of its construction , let us first explain what this space is in the ` classical ' case when @xmath3 is a lattice in @xmath37 , where @xmath7 is a local field .",
    "let @xmath38 be the subgroup of @xmath39 consisting of diagonal matrices , and @xmath40 the singular torus @xmath41 then we consider the @xmath3-spaces @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( or the actions of @xmath38 and @xmath40 on @xmath44 ) .",
    "ergodicity is then provided by the howe ",
    "moore theorem .",
    "the gate of the space @xmath45 gives a representation of @xmath46 .",
    "now let us go back to the setting of theorem  [ thm : nonlinear - local ] , where @xmath3 is a lattice of an @xmath4-building @xmath0 that can a priori be exotic . in particular the whole group @xmath13 could be discrete , and the @xmath3-spaces we need to construct can thus hardly be homogeneous spaces of a non - discrete locally compact envelope of @xmath3 .",
    "the spaces we shall construct are of geometric nature ; the measures will be constructed explicitly by hand , and a crucial step in our proof will be to establish their ergodicity .    in order to define a geometric analogue of the space @xmath42 in the classical case mentioned above , we consider the set @xmath47 consisting of all simplicial embeddings of the coxeter complex @xmath48 of type @xmath4 to @xmath0 .",
    "the group @xmath49 acts on the set @xmath47 via its action on @xmath48 , while @xmath3 acts on @xmath47 via its action on @xmath0 .",
    "in particular these two actions commute , and we get a @xmath49-action on the compact space @xmath50 .",
    "the latter action is called the * cartan flow*. a measure on @xmath47 is constructed in  [ subsec : d2 ] .",
    "a geometric analogue of the space @xmath43 from the classical picture is more technical to realize .",
    "it is a kind of geodesic flow in the singular direction : the group @xmath51 acts by translating singular geodesic .",
    "the space we consider however is larger than this : we consider all the geodesics which are parallel to a given one , and translate them at once .",
    "this gives an action of @xmath51 on a space @xmath52 , which we call the * singular cartan flow*. we again define a natural measure on this space @xmath52 ( see  [ subsec : dpm ] for more details ) .    a fundamental step in our proof of theorem  [ thm : nonlinear - local ] is the following ( see theorem [ cartanflow ] and theorem [ ergodic ] for more precise statements ) .    the cartan flow and the singular cartan flow are ergodic .    as mentioned above",
    ", those flows are a priori not homogeneous spaces of some locally compact groups ; in particular the ergodicity can not be deduced from the howe ",
    "moore theorem as it is done in the classical picture .",
    "the relevant tool happens to be one originally used in the study of the geodesic flow on manifolds with variable negative curvature , namely hopf s argument @xcite ( see also @xcite for a nice introduction ) . in appendix  [ app - hopf ]",
    "we give an abstract version of the hopf argument which is suited for our purpose .",
    "the cartan flow is not needed for the end of the proof , but it is an intermediate step in the proof of the ergodicity of the singular cartan flow .    if @xmath33 denotes the singular cartan flow , the gate theory provides us with a linear representation of @xmath36 ( the latter groups is @xmath53 in the classical case ) .",
    "it appears that the group @xmath36 naturally contains a group that has been studied in the axiomatic theory of projective geometry : it is the so - called * projectivity group * of the projective plane at infinity of @xmath0 .",
    "this projectivity group has a lot more structure than @xmath3 : it acts on a locally finite tree @xmath54 ( a so - called _ panel - tree _ of @xmath0 ) with a 3-transitive action on its boundary .",
    "the final step in the proof of theorem  [ thm : nonlinear - local ] will be deduced from the following result of independent interest ( see theorem  [ thm : charbt ] ) :    [ thm : projintro ] let @xmath0 be a locally finite @xmath4-building and @xmath55 be the closure of the projectivity group in the locally compact group @xmath56 . if an open subgroup of @xmath55 admits a faithful continuous representation @xmath57 , where @xmath7 is a local field , then @xmath0 is a bruhat ",
    "tits building .",
    "it should be underlined that , while all the other steps of the proof generalize with only small modifications to euclidean buildings of other types than @xmath4 , we do not know how to extend theorem  [ thm : projintro ] to @xmath58 or @xmath59 buildings . indeed",
    "the proof of the latter relies on a result on projective planes due to a.  schleiermarcher ( theorem  [ thm : schleiermacher ] ) , whose analogue for generalized quadrangles and generalized hexagons is still unknown .",
    "let us now briefly discuss the proof of theorem  [ thm : nonlineargalois ] , which is presented in appendix  [ app : galois ] .",
    "it also relies on the bader ",
    "furman machinery from @xcite .",
    "the starting point of that proof is the observation that the argument for theorem  [ nonlinear ] sketched above also provides relevant information when @xmath0 is the bruhat ",
    "tits building of @xmath60 . indeed , while in that case the projectivity group is isomorphic to @xmath61 , and is thus linear by hypothesis , it turns out that the group @xmath34 of automorphisms of the cartan flow commuting with @xmath3 considered above can be strictly larger than the projectivity group . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath3 is a galois lattice , then @xmath3 has an infinite ( hence non - virtually abelian by property ( t ) ) image in the quotient @xmath62 , which is virtually the group of field automorphisms of @xmath0 .",
    "it then turns out that @xmath63 is also a non - abelian group of field automorphisms of @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "the gate theory provides us with a continuous faithful representation of the locally compact group @xmath34 , and by the general structure theory of linear locally compact groups from @xcite , this implies that @xmath63 must in fact be virtually abelian .",
    "this shows that if @xmath3 is linear , then it can not be a galois lattice .",
    "this part of the argument does not require @xmath0 to be of type @xmath4 , and is actually valid for arbitrary irreducible bruhat ",
    "tits buildings of dimension  @xmath1 .",
    "indeed the relevant @xmath3-spaces are indeed homogeneous spaces of the non - discrete group @xmath13 , and their ergodicity can be established by a suitable application of the howe  moore theorem .",
    "the aforementioned classification of irreducible affine buildings of dimension  @xmath14 was completed in the early days of the 1980 s .",
    "the existence of exotic @xmath18-dimensional affine buildings came soon after .",
    "some of them have no non - trivial automorphism whatsoever ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; this is in particular the case of _ generic _ @xmath4-buildings ( in a suitably defined baire categorical sense ) , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th .  5 ) .",
    "some have a cocompact automorphism group , with a global fixed vertex at infinity , see @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a fixed point prevents that group from being unimodular ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "m ) ) , and hence can not contain any lattice . the known exotic @xmath4-buildings relevant to theorem  [ nonlinear ] are those endowed with a proper cocompact action of a discrete group .",
    "they are constructed as universal covers of finite complexes having finite projective planes as residues , or of suitably defined finite complexes of groups .",
    "the constructions that we are aware of are the following ( the * order * of a locally finite @xmath4-building is the common order of its * residue planes * , i.e. the finite projective planes appearing as its rank  @xmath18 residues ) .    * in @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.5 ) , tits and ronan construct four @xmath4-buildings of order  @xmath18 with cocompact lattices .",
    "the lattices act regularly on the set of chambers of their building .",
    "it is shown in @xcite and @xcite that two of those are bruhat  tits buildings with arithmetic lattices , while the other two are exotic ( see also @xcite ) . * in @xcite and @xcite , tits constructs 45 @xmath4-buildings of order @xmath64 with cocompact lattices acting regularly on the set of chambers of their building .",
    "it is asserted that 43 of them are exotic .",
    "* in @xcite and @xcite , ronan and kantor describe a framework providing in particular cocompact lattices of @xmath4-buildings acting sharply transitively on the panels of each given type .",
    "such lattices are called * panel - regular*. * in @xcite , cartwright  mantero  steger ",
    "zappa construct @xmath65 exotic @xmath4-buildings of order @xmath66 with cocompact lattices . in those examples , the lattices act regularly on the set of vertices of their building ; in particular the types of vertices are permuted cyclically . * in @xcite ,",
    "barr construct an exotic @xmath4-building of order @xmath18 with a cocompact lattice .",
    "the full automorphism group of that building is discrete , and has exactly two orbits of vertices . * in @xcite",
    ", essert provides presentations of arbitrary panel - regular lattices in @xmath4-buildings .",
    "when the building is of order @xmath18 , there are exactly two inequivalent presentations of such groups .",
    "one of them gives rise to an arithmetic group , the other is exotic ( see remark  [ rem : residually-2 ] and lemma  [ lem : g_0 ] below ) .",
    "the @xmath4-buildings of order  @xmath66 and @xmath67 admitting a panel - regular lattice have recently been classified by s.  witzel ( see @xcite ) , who determined which are exotic and described their full automorphism group .",
    "we show in appendix  [ app : exoticlargeorder ] how to use theorem  [ nonlinear ] to construct , from a given panel - regular lattice in an exotic @xmath4 of order @xmath68 , an infinite family of panel - regular lattice in an exotic @xmath4 of order @xmath69 .",
    "in particular we obtain cocompact lattices in exotic @xmath4-buildings of arbitrarily large order .",
    "* in all of the previous examples , the residue planes are always desarguesian .",
    "recently , n.  radu @xcite constructed an example of an exotic @xmath4-building of order  @xmath70 , with a vertex - transitive discrete automorphism group and with non - desarguesian residues ( isomorphic to the hughes plane of order  @xmath70 ) .",
    "remark that in all those examples , the lattices are cocompact : no exotic example with a non - uniform lattice is known .",
    "exotic buildings of type @xmath71 and @xmath59 have been less investigated , but some constructions are known , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , the most fascinating example of an exotic @xmath18-dimensional affine building with a cocompact lattice is probably the building of type @xmath59 constructed by kantor @xcite as the universal cover of a simplicial complex associated with the finite sporadic simple group of lyons ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding building is exotic ( an assertion attributed to tits , without proof , in @xcite ) .",

    "the main result of this section is theorem  [ thm : charbt ] which roughly states that the projectivity group of a building admits a linear representation if and only if the building is bruhat  tits .",

    "standard references to the subject are @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us start by recalling the definition of a building of type @xmath4 ( or @xmath4-building for short ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 a * model apartment * : it is the triangular complex obtained by tessellation of the euclidean plane @xmath72 by equilateral triangle .",
    "a * wall * in @xmath48 is a line in @xmath48 which is a union of edges .",
    "we fix a vertex @xmath73 .",
    "a * building * of type @xmath4 is a triangular complex satisfying the two following conditions , in which we call * apartment * a subcomplex of @xmath0 isomorphic to @xmath48 :    * any two simplices of @xmath0 are contained in an apartment , * if @xmath74 and @xmath75 are two apartments , there exists a simplicial isomorphism @xmath76 which fixes pointwise @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath18-dimensional simplices of an @xmath4-building are called * chambers*. the space @xmath0 is endowed with a natural metric , defined as follows : the distance between two points @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the distance between @xmath78 and @xmath79 calculated in any apartment containing @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this is well - defined , and furthermore gives a cat(0 ) metric on @xmath0 .",
    "apartments are also called * flats * , because in the cat(@xmath80)-metric on @xmath0 , the apartments are maximal subspaces isometric to a euclidean space .",
    "an @xmath4-building @xmath0 is equipped with a coloring @xmath81 of its vertex set such that each chamber has exactly one vertex of each color .",
    "the color of a vertex is called its * type*.    we assume throughout that the building @xmath0 is * thick * , i.e. there is more than two chambers adjacent to each edge .",
    "it is worth noting that the local geometry is forced by the geometry of the building . for a start ,",
    "the building is * regular * : the cardinality of the set of chambers adjacent to an edge is constant ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) ) . when that number is finite , we define the * order * of the @xmath4-building @xmath0 as the number @xmath82 such that the number of chambers adjacent to each edge equals @xmath83 .",
    "since we assumed @xmath0 to be thick we have @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , the link at a vertex is always a ( finite ) projective plane , as is the boundary of the building , as we explain below . for the convenience of the reader , we recall the definition :    [ def : projectiveplane ] a *",
    "projective plane * is a bipartite graph , with two types of vertices ( called * points * and * lines * ) , such that    * any two lines are adjacent to a unique point , * any two points are adjacent to a unique line .",
    "* there exist four points , no three of which are adjacent to a common line .",
    "projective planes are also known as generalized triangles , or buildings of type @xmath85 .",
    "another striking feature of @xmath4 ( or more general affine ) buildings is the following fact :    [ aptfull ] let @xmath86 be a subset of @xmath0 which is either convex or of non - empty interior .",
    "if @xmath86 is isometric to a subset of @xmath72 , then there exists an apartment @xmath74 such that @xmath87 .    an important class of subsets of @xmath0 to which we will apply this theorem is the following :    a * sector * based at @xmath80 in @xmath48 is a connected component of the complement in @xmath48 of the union of the walls passing through @xmath80 .",
    "a sector of @xmath0 is a subset of @xmath0 which is isometric to a sector in @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a building of type @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath0 is a cat(@xmath80 ) space , its ideal boundary @xmath88 is naturally endowed with the structure of a cat(@xmath89 ) space .",
