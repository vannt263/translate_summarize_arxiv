    "numerous experiments using unstable nuclear beams have succeeded to reveal exotic properties of @xmath15-unstable nuclei , including a neutron halo structure@xcite .",
    "especially , the shift of the closed - shell structure is a characteristic behavior of systems with weakly bound neutrons .",
    "recently , the contributions of the @xmath16 shell have been analyzed in @xmath17 nuclei based on the shell model .",
    "a calculation has shown that the slow @xmath15-decay of @xmath8be to @xmath8b can be explained by an admixture of the @xmath16 shell in @xmath8be ( @xmath17 ) in which the closed @xmath11-shell component must be less than 30@xmath18@xcite .",
    "this shows that the concept of magic numbers is vague in @xmath8be .    on the other hand , an @xmath2-@xmath2 structure",
    "is well established in the be and b region . typically in @xmath19be",
    ", a microscopic @xmath2+@xmath2+@xmath3 model has reproduced the properties of low - lying states including the level inversion of @xmath20 in the @xmath11-shell and @xmath13 in the @xmath16 shell@xcite .",
    "also in @xmath1be , the microscopic @xmath2-cluster models have been applied @xcite , and we have quantitively shown the mechanism for the lowering of the @xmath16 orbits related with the clustering of the core@xcite .    according to our previous results for @xmath1be ,",
    "the main properties of this nucleus have been well described by the @xmath2+@xmath2+n+n model , where the orbits for the two valence neutrons are classified based on the molecular - orbit ( mo ) model .",
    "the dominant configuration of the two valence neutrons for the second @xmath0 state is @xmath4 , and the level inversion between @xmath20 and @xmath13 in @xmath19be also holds in @xmath1be . here , the two valence neutrons stay along the @xmath2-@xmath2 axis , and reduce the kinetic energy by enhancing the @xmath2-@xmath2 distance ( up to around 4 fm ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath13 orbit in this case is not a spherical @xmath21-wave , but a polarized orbit with the @xmath22-wave component .",
    "this feature of @xmath16 mixing in the @xmath13 orbit can be qualitatively interpreted in terms of deformed models ( [ 220 ] expression in the nilsson diagram ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show the mechanism for the appearance of this @xmath4 configuration in low - lying energy in detail . in our previous work",
    ", the calculated excitation energy of the second @xmath0 state has been higher by @xmath75 mev without the spin - orbit interaction than the experimental one@xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction has been found to decrease the excitation energy by 3 mev by adding a single optimal wave function with @xmath23 .",
    "hence , it is necessary to analyze the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction more precisely to clarify the lowering mechanism of the second @xmath0 state .",
    "the other reduction mechanism of the kinetic energy by more accurate description of the neutron - tail should also be taken into account .",
    "firstly , the spin - orbit interaction is able to contribute to the second @xmath0 state , when spin - triplet states for the valence neutrons are included among the basis states .",
    "if the @xmath13 state consists of the pure s - orbit , naturally there is no contribution of the spin - orbit interaction . in",
    "be isotopes , the state contains the @xmath22-orbit component .",
    "however , the spin - orbit interaction again vanishes , when the two valence neutrons occupy along the @xmath2-@xmath2 axis , since two neutrons with the same spatial distribution construct only the spin - singlet state .",
    "this has been the situation in traditional mo models@xcite .",
    "it will be shown that when one of the valence neutrons deviates from the @xmath2-@xmath2 axis , the spin - triplet state can be constructed , and the spin - orbit interaction strongly acts between this state and the original @xmath4 configuration with the spin - singlet .",
    "the extension of the model space also enables us to improve the description of the neutron - tail .",
    "we estimate the reduction of the kinetic energy due to the improvement of the neutron - tail .",
    "these improvements will be shown to largely decrease the excitation energy of the second @xmath0 state , and that the calculated energy just corresponds to the experimental value .    using the present extended mo model , negative - parity states in @xmath1be are also investigated .",
    "the mixing of different spin structure @xmath24 is found to also be important in the negative - parity states .",
    "the @xmath25-mixing effect strongly acts on the @xmath6 state , and the calculated small - level spacing between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7300 kev ) agrees with the experimental value .    also , in @xmath8be these two important mechanism for lowering the @xmath4 configuration are examined . in @xmath8be , the configuration for four valence neutrons around the @xmath2-@xmath2 core",
    "is considered to correspond to the two pair configurations , @xmath26 and @xmath4 .",
    "these two pair configurations appear in the ground @xmath0 state and the second @xmath0 state of @xmath1be , respectively .",
    "the energy surface for the ground state of @xmath8be will be shown , in which the spin - orbit interaction is seen to make the binding for the @xmath10 configuration properly stronger in comparison with the @xmath12 configuration .",
    "this is related to the breaking of the @xmath17 ( closed @xmath11-shell ) neutron - magic number .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize a description of the single - particle orbits around the two @xmath2 clusters based on the mo model . in sec .",
    "iii , the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction to the @xmath4 configuration and the reduction of the kinetic energy due to an improvement of the neutron - tail are considered .",
    "these effects are discussed in detail for the second @xmath0 state of @xmath1be ( * a * ) , for the negative parity states of @xmath1be ( * b * ) , and for @xmath8be ( * c * ) .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",

    "the details of the framework are given in ref.@xcite ; here , the essential part is presented .",
    "the hamiltonian is the same as in ref.@xcite , and consists of a kinetic - energy term , a central two - body interaction term , a two - body spin - orbit interaction term , and a coulomb interaction term : @xmath28 the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction is volkov no.2@xcite for the central part and the g3rs spin - orbit term@xcite for the spin - orbit part , as follows : @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a projection operator onto the triplet odd state .",

    "this is much larger than the experimental excitation energy of the second @xmath0 state ( 6.26 mev@xcite ) by 5 mev .",
    "there are two reasons for this lack of binding energy by 5 mev in the second @xmath0 state .",
    "one is that the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction is not taken into account ; the other is that the tail of the valence neutron is not correctly described . as for the spin - orbit interaction , in the traditional mo model ,",
    "the spin - orbit interaction has not contributed to the @xmath0 state with this configuration .",
    "this is because , the two valence neutrons occupy the same spatial configurations with opposite spin direction , and construct a spin - singlet state .",

    "although the energy of such a spin - triplet state , itself , is much higher than that of @xmath110 by about 20 mev , the large coupling between the spin - singlet and spin - triplet states enables the spin - orbit interaction to attractively act . as a result ,",

    "4 as a function of the parameter @xmath119 .    -",
    "+ fig . 4 + - +    the point on the @xmath121-@xmath52 plain in fig .",
    "4 shows the gaussian - center @xmath119 in the spin - triplet state .",
    "the contour map shows the energy calculated by taking into account this coupling with the spin - triplet state .",
    "this @xmath2-@xmath2 distance is 3 fm , and this optimal distance is smaller than that for the second @xmath0 state of @xmath1be by about 1 fm , since two of the four valence neutrons occupy the @xmath26 configuration and increase the binding energy of the system . because of this effect , the coupling effect of the spin - triplet states is more important than in the case of the second @xmath0 state of @xmath1be .",
    "the minimal point of the surface shows that the energy gain due to the couplings is about 4 mev in @xmath8be .    the solid line in fig .",
    "3 shows the @xmath0 energy calculated by taking into account the coupling effect between the @xmath10 configuration and the @xmath155 basis states for the last two valence neutrons . due to the spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the energy is almost the same as that of @xmath12 corresponding to the closed @xmath11-shell configuration .",
    "furthermore , the energy of @xmath10 is suggested to become even lower than @xmath12 when the pairing effect between @xmath26 and @xmath102 is taken into account .",
    "these effects plays crucial roles in accounting for breaking of the @xmath156 magic number .",
    "the second @xmath0 state of @xmath1be has been shown to be characterized by the @xmath61-orbit of the two valence neutrons in terms of the molecular orbit ( mo ) model .",
    "the two valence neutrons stay along the @xmath2-@xmath2 axis ( the @xmath13 orbit ) and reduce the kinetic energy by enlarging the @xmath2-@xmath2 distance .",
    "this simple description for the second @xmath0 state gives a higher excitation energy by 5 mev compared to the experimental one . to improve the description , spin - triplet basis states which have not been included in the traditional mo models",
    "are prepared by allowing a deviation of the neutron orbit from one just along the @xmath2-@xmath2 axis .",
    "thus , the spin - orbit interaction can be taken into account , and the calculated second @xmath0 state becomes lower by 3.5 mev .",
    "the precise description of the neutron - tail also decreases the excitation energy by 1.5 mev .",
    "the discrepancy between the experimental excitation energy and the calculated one is compensated by these two effects .",
    "the spin - mixing effects were studied for the negative parity state of @xmath1be .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the @xmath128 basis state , this energy splitting between the @xmath5 state and @xmath6 state is about 1 mev , which is much larger than the experimental value of 303 kev . as a result of adding basis states with @xmath116 , where the spin directions of the two valence neutrons are the same",
    ", the @xmath25-mixing occurs especially for the @xmath6 state .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath116 state is larger for the @xmath6 state .",
    "the resultant energy splitting becomes comparable to the experimental one .",
    "therefore , the experimental small level splitting between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is considered to be a result of the spin vibration induced by the spin - orbit interaction in the @xmath6 state .",
    "the coupling with the spin - triplet basis states is also important in the case of @xmath8be . without the spin - triplet basis state ,",
    "the energy of the configuration @xmath157 is much higher than that of the closed @xmath11-shall configuration ( @xmath158 ) by 4 mev .",
    "however , the energy of @xmath157 is drastically decreased by coupling with the spin - triplet states .",
    "this is because the effect becomes stronger as the @xmath2-@xmath2 distance becomes shorter , and @xmath8be has an optimal @xmath2-@xmath2 distance around 3 fm , which is smaller than the second @xmath0 state of @xmath1be by 1 fm .",
    "the study shows that an energy of @xmath157 is almost the same as @xmath158 , or even lower .",
    "this effect is suggested to play a crucial role in accounting for the dissipation of the @xmath17 magic number in @xmath8be .",
    "it is an interesting subject to analyze the binding mechanism and properties of the ground state by taking into account the pairing mixing among states with configurations of @xmath158 , @xmath157 , and @xmath159 .",
    "a detail analysis is going to be performed not only for this state , but also for excited states where new states with cluster structure have been recently observed .",
