    "nonlinear resonant interaction of internal waves is one of the key processes leading to small - scale mixing in the ocean .",
    "in particular the parametric subharmonic instability ( psi ) allows the transport of energy from large to smaller scales by giving birth to two secondary subharmonic waves ( with wave vector modulus @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) from an initial primary wave ( with wave vector modulus @xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "thanks to a new experimental and analysis tool , @xcite have recently shown how the psi theory developed for plane waves is in good agreement with the experimental observations of the instability of a quasi - monochromatic wave beam . as stressed by  @xcite",
    ", one challenge is now to determine the range of validity of the theory and in particular the role of the width of the wave beam on the occurrence of the instability . in other words , is the instability affected by the width of the beam ?",
    "this question is particularly important in the oceanic context where internal waves are known to develop preferentially in the form of finite size beams , for instance waves emitted by the interaction of tide with topography  @xcite .",
    "moreover , energy transfer between scales , as well as wave turbulence in oceans , are open questions and a study of the role of the beam width on secondary waves selection in psi might bring new understanding to these issues .",
    "this is the aim of the present work , combining experimental , numerical and theoretical approaches . starting with the observation that finite - width beams can inhibit the instability , we continue by studying the effect of the beam width on the selection rules .",

    "note that to avoid spurious emission of internal waves on the extremities of the moving region , the amplitude of the plates is constant over @xmath8 wavelengths in the central region , while one half - wavelength with a smooth decrease of the amplitude is added on each side .",

    "to understand this observation , it is crucial to realize that the theory of psi is derived for infinitely extended plane waves , as described in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we thus propose to take into account the _ width _ of the primary wave beam , the guiding idea being that the two secondary plane waves can exit the spatial extent of the primary wave beam  @xcite .",
    "once they have left this region , they can not interact any more with the primary plane wave and the energy transfer is broken .    to perform an energy balance ,",
    "let us define a control area within the primary wave beam as presented by the tilted rectangle in figure  [ figmodele ] . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the spatial attenuation of the waves in this area , i.e. the surface energy densities @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the different waves are considered uniform .",
    "consequently , the temporal variation of the primary plane wave energy in the domain is due to :    \\i ) nonlinear interactions that transfer energy from the primary wave to both secondary ones ( denoted @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the two other waves of the triad ) ;    \\ii ) viscosity ;    \\iii ) incoming and outgoing flux of the primary wave . + for the domain @xmath38 , this can be summarized as    @xmath39    with @xmath40 the surface energy injected by the generator and @xmath41 .    assuming that psi occurs everywhere in the beam",
    ", the outgoing energy flux of the secondary waves through the cross beam faces with width w is compensated by the incoming one . in contrast , since they do not propagate parallel to the primary beam , they exit the control area also from the lateral boundaries without compensation . for the temporal variation of the secondary waves energy in the domain , this leads to @xmath42    with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the modulus of the group velocity @xmath45 .",
    "the first term represents the interaction with the other plane waves of the triadic resonance while the third one accounts for the energy exiting the control area . as @xmath46 , using the infinite width expression  @xcite for the interaction terms , one gets @xmath47 with @xmath48 the interaction term defined as follows @xmath49 \\label{eq : i}\\ ] ] with @xmath50 and @xmath51 a forcing term , corresponding to the difference between the incoming energy and the outgoing one for the primary wave .",
    "the solution for @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be easily obtained with the hypothesis @xmath21 constant .",
    "one finds exponentially growing solutions with growth rate @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the inverse of an advection time since it characterizes the transport of the secondary waves energy out of the interaction region .",
    "the viscous part of the expression of @xmath57 is similar to the expression obtained in  @xcite in the limit of large prandtl number .",
    "cases with large @xmath58 values will present a very strong finite - width effect .",
    "three parameters impact the value of the growth rate :    1 .   the width @xmath27 of the beam .",
    "the term @xmath58 varies like the inverse of @xmath27 , thus the growth rate is decreased when the beam is narrow . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath27 goes to infinity , @xmath58 vanishes and the growth rate of the original theory @xcite is recovered .",
    "2 .   the amplitude of the group velocities of the secondary waves .",
    "when the modulus of the secondary wave vector @xmath59 is small , the group velocity increases and the secondary waves exit the primary wave beam more rapidly .",
    "so there is less time for them to grow in amplitude . besides",
    ", @xmath58 is weaker for low stratification  @xmath6 ( small group velocity ) at @xmath60 and @xmath61 fixed , which implies a stronger instability in the oceans where @xmath6 is weak compared with laboratory conditions .",
    "the direction of the group velocity of each waves of the triad .",
    "when the secondary waves are almost perpendicular to the primary plane wave , they leave the interaction area quickly , which does not favor the instability . to summarize , this finite - width effect is stronger when the group velocity of the secondary wave is aligned with @xmath62 .    for configurations i and ii presented in figure  [ drhot ] ,",
    "the above model predicts that the growth rate is an increasing function of  @xmath27 . for an infinitely wide wave beam ,",
    "the instability occurs for any value of the amplitude ( see appendix ) .",
    "in contrast , for finite width beams , a non vanishing threshold appears .",
    "for example , for @xmath63 , the maximum growth rate becomes negative for @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , during the finite duration of the experiment , even if the instability occurs , the amplitude of the two secondary waves might be too small to be detected .",
    "for example , we can define a detection criterion by requiring that for the secondary waves to be detected , the duration of the experiment must exceed 3 times the inverse of the growth rate . with this criterion , in the case of an infinitely wide wave beam ,",
    "the instability can only be observed during the experiment if @xmath65 whereas for @xmath63 , the threshold is five times higher , @xmath66 .",
    "interestingly , this value of amplitude threshold has the same order of magnitude as the imposed amplitude in configurations i and ii , notwithstanding the simplifying hypothesis made by neglecting spatial attenuation in the longitudinal ( viscous decay ) and transversal ( imposed wave beam shape ) direction of the primary wave .",
    "therefore , the above model gives an explanation why the instability occurs in these two configurations only for @xmath27 larger than @xmath67 .",
    "this new analysis reveals a dramatic effect on the development of the triad instability which has been totally overlooked before . when the beam gets narrower , the psi cut - off , initially due only to viscosity , is displaced towards a larger forcing amplitude so that at a given amplitude , the instability can be completely suppressed by decreasing the beam width .",

    "the two vectors represent the direction of the group velocity for one of the two secondary plane waves .",
    "[ figcompa],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we will now show that the finite - width effect can also result in a specific triad selection . to do that , we focus on the results for another set of parameters ( configurations iii - v , see table  [ table_parameters ] ) , this case is therefore different from the previous one .",
    "experimental and numerical wave fields ( respectively configurations iii and iv ) presented in figures  [ figcompa](a ) and [ figcompa](b ) are in good agreement . as underlined by  @xcite , the theoretical prediction for an infinite primary plane wave is that for this set of parameters ( configurations iii - iv ) , the wavelength of one of the secondary waves generated by the instability is larger than the primary wavelength , while the other one is smaller ( see table  [ table_secondary_waves ] ) . in this case , the energetic transfer will occur towards larger and smaller scales simultaneously .",
    "however , this prediction was not verified and a different type of triad was observed experimentally in  @xcite , with transfer to smaller scales only .",
    "this difference between the prediction and the observations can again be traced back to the finite width of the wave beam . to demonstrate that , we rely on numerical results since the experimental set - up can not generate plane waves with a beam size larger than @xmath73 . note that we have performed numerical simulations for @xmath74 ( yielding similar results as for @xmath67 ) , and @xmath75 ( yielding similar results as for @xmath76 ) .",

    "figure  [ figcompa](c ) shows the results of configuration v , i.e. for the same parameters but for a significantly wider beam ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the primary wave beam is still unstable , but the secondary waves look quite different compared to the results for @xmath71 . to quantify the differences , a temporal hilbert transform  @xcite and a spatial fourier transform",

    "the transition between the external and central triad configurations is obtained around @xmath84 ( vertical line).[figtheo],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ] +    these observations can be explained by the finite - width theoretical approach presented previously : the predicted evolution of the maximum value of the growth rate as a function of @xmath27 is shown in figure  [ figtheo](c ) .",
    "the growth rates were computed separately for the external ( @xmath85 symbols ) and central ( @xmath86 symbols ) cases . a transition between the two possible triads",
    "is predicted around @xmath87 . for @xmath88 ,",
    "the most unstable triad is on the external branch .",
    "the corresponding predicted location of the tip of wave vector  @xmath77 is displayed as a rectangle in figure  [ figtheo](a ) , showing a very good agreement with the numerical observation .",
    "for this narrow beam , this agreement extends as well to the experimental data . on the contrary , for wide enough beams , i.e. above the threshold  @xmath89 , in spite of the fact that @xmath81 is almost perpendicular to @xmath90 ( a condition enhancing the value of @xmath58 ) , the secondary waves have time to grow before leaving the interaction area .",
    "consequently , the central triad becomes dominant when increasing the beam width . in the time evolution of the numerical experiment ,",
    "this triad appears first , the result derived for infinitely wide beams is thus recovered . at a later time",
    ", it is followed by the second triad .",
    "our numerical results confirm that the width of the beam changes the selection of the triad .",
    "this new effect explains why energy transfer is mainly towards smaller scales for narrow beams .",
    "this new finite - width theory is therefore of importance when consideringinternal wave beams from in - situ observations of the ocean  @xcite . in the ocean , since the wavelengths are larger by several orders of magnitude , the reynolds number is much larger than in the experiments and consequently viscous effects can be safely neglected .",
    "consequently , the beam width is the dominating control parameter for the growth rate .",
    "we will focus on equatorial regions , for which the background rotation has no effect .",
    "for example , we consider a primary beam with the following typical parameters :    1 .",
    "@xmath91 rad@xmath92s@xmath69 , which corresponds to the diurnal m2 tide period .",
    "@xmath93 m , which corresponds to field measurements in kaena ridge , hawaii @xcite .",

    "this value of the buoyancy frequency allows a propagation angle of @xmath95  which is close to oceanic observations .",
    "the froude number @xmath96 @xcite which allows us to estimate @xmath21 .",
    "the vertical component of the coriolis force is ignored and the coriolis parameter @xmath97 is set to zero .",
    "figure [ casoceanique](a ) shows the evolution of the growth rate as a function of the width of the beam . with the chosen parameters ,",
    "the transition between the external and central triad configurations is obtained around @xmath98 .",
    "figure [ casoceanique](b ) presents the evolution of the modulus of the secondary wave vectors for the external case ( black lines ) and the central case ( gray lines ) as a function of the width of the primary beam .",
    "for example for a narrow beam @xmath99 , the maximum of growth rate is obtained on the external branch ( [ casoceanique](a ) ) and psi enables a transfer to smaller scales : @xmath100 ( figure [ casoceanique](b ) ) .",
    "this behavior corresponds to simulations  @xcite and to oceanic observations  @xcite .",
    "moreover the value of the growth rate predicted by the model ( @xmath101 day@xmath69 ) gives a value which has the right order of magnitude when compared to numerical values : 0.5 day@xmath69 @xcite , or 0.66 day@xmath69 @xcite and to oceanic measurements : from 0.2 to 0.5 day@xmath69 @xcite . on the contrary for a larger beam",
    ", the instability enables transfer to both larger and smaller scales ( @xmath102 ) which corresponds to the infinitely wide theory prediction .",
    "this transition depends on the amplitude of the stream function @xmath21 .",
    "for example , for @xmath21 three times larger , the transition is obtained for @xmath103 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath21 three times smaller , the transition is obtained for @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the transition between the two behaviors appears for @xmath27 close to the typical width of an oceanic beam .",

    "we have shown theoretically , numerically and experimentally that the width of the internal wave beam is a key element in parametric subharmonic instability .",
    "this feature had been totally overlooked previously , despite its dramatic consequences on the triad selection mechanism .",
    "the subharmonic plane waves that are theoretically unstable can only extract energy from the primary wave if they do not leave the primary beam too quickly .",
    "this finite - width mechanism has two opposite consequences on the wave energy dissipation : it introduces a psi threshold ( reducing transfer and therefore dissipation ) , but when psi is present it enhances the transfer towards small wavelengths , more affected by dissipation .",
    "a complete theoretical study of the impact of the envelope on the psi will be a timely achievement .",
    "we are aware of a recent work about the weakly nonlinear asymptotic analysis of the problem by  @xcite .",
    "it has not escaped our notice that the coriolis force will significantly modify the prediction .",
    "indeed , the group velocity for inertia - gravity waves , which is proportional to @xmath111 , decreases with the coriolis parameter @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "the rotation reducing the ability of subharmonic waves to escape , it seriously reinforces the instability . at the critical latitude , the group velocity vanishing",
    ", one should even recover the theoretical prediction for plane waves .",
    "finally , from a more fundamental point of view , such a mechanism modifies significantly the transfer of energy between scales and must be taken into account in all analysis  @xcite of wave turbulence , in which infinitely wide plane waves are until now the common theoretical objects , but not appropriate for careful predictions .",

    "this expression has already been reported in  @xcite and  @xcite with minor typos in the latter case .",
