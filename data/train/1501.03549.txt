    "the next proposition shows that this is actually the case .",
    "the argument amounts to showing that they have no non - trivial periodic stress .",
    "[ nostress ] a periodic pseudo - triangulation can not have nontrivial periodic stresses .",

    "however , with an angle exceeding @xmath120 on some face around each vertex , neither a maximum nor a minimum is possible .",
    "thus , the edge length conditions are infinitesimally independent and the implicit function theorem gives a local deformation space which is smooth and of dimension one .",
    "we present now a proof of a most remarkable property of periodic pseudo - triangulations .    *",
    "( periodic pointed pseudo - triangulations have expansive 1dof flexes)*[thm : expansive ] let @xmath1 be a planar periodic pseudo - triangulation .",
    "then the framework has a one - parameter periodic deformation , which is expansive for as long as it remains a pseudo - triangulation",
    ".    * proof outline .",
    "* we compare the infinitesimal variation of the distance between two pairs of vertices ( which do not belong to rigid subcomponents ) and show that one can not increase while the other decreases .",
    "an argument already used by maxwell in @xcite shows that it is enough to reason with two pairs of vertices which do not create self - crossing when inserted as edges ( and replicated by periodicity ) .",
    "after one edge insertion , the framework becomes infinitesimally rigid and after the second edge insertion it becomes periodically stressed , with a one dimensional periodic stress space .",
    "since either pointedness or non - crossing of edges is violated only by the newly inserted edges , and since a pointed vertex can not be a local extremum for the height function , we infer that the associated periodic lifting must have its global maximum and global minimum at two of the vertices in the two added edges .",
    "considerations of stress sign and of the related mountain / valley type of the lifted edges , as summarized in prop .",
    "[ prop : signstress ] ) show that the new edge orbits have stress factors of opposite signs .",
    "this in turn implies ( by linear programming duality ) that the infinitesimal variation of the distance between the two pairs of vertices is of the same kind : expansion or contraction .",
    "* proof details . *",
    "we develop our arguments in a sequence of lemmas .",
    "first , we consider what happens after one edge is inserted in a non - crossing manner .",
    "[ edge1 ] the periodic framework obtained by inserting a new @xmath124-orbit of non - crossing edges in a periodic pointed pseudo - triangulation is minimally rigid , that is , infinitesimally rigid with @xmath294 edge orbits .",
    "relation ( [ eq : psf ] ) for the extended framework implies that the dimension of the space of periodic flexes equals the dimension of the space of periodic stresses , i.e. @xmath295 .",
    "we argue now that no nontrivial periodic stress exists , i.e. @xmath296 . indeed , a nontrivial periodic stress would give a nontrivial periodic lifting .",
    "the latter must have a global maximum vertex and a global minimum vertex . since pointed vertices can not be either maxima or minima , the two extrema must occur at the endpoints of the new edge .",
    "however , a maximum vertex requires at least three non - pointed ` mountain ' edges and a minimum vertex requires at least three non - pointed ` valley ' edges .",
    "the new edge would have to be a ` mountain ' because of the maximum at one end and would have to be a ` valley ' because of the minimum at the other end .",
    "this contradiction proves the lemma .",
    "we analyze now what happens after a non - crossing second edge orbit insertion . by inserting this new edge and its @xmath124-orbit in the minimally rigid framework",
    "obtained above , we must have a one - dimensional space of periodic stresses since the space of infinitesimal flexes remains null .",
    "[ edge2 ] if we add two new edge orbits to a periodic pseudo - triangulation , then we can not have the same sign for the stress factors on the two new edge orbits inserted in the pseudo - triangulation .",
    "we argue first for the case of no common vertex mod @xmath124 for the two new edges .",
    "then , as shown above in lemma  [ edge1 ] , we can not have the maximum and the minimum at the two ends of the same new edge .",
    "thus the edge reaching to the maximum is a ` mountain ' and the other one , reaching to the minimum , is a ` valley ' .    in case the two new edges share a vertex",
    ", we note that at least one extremum must be at some unshared vertex .",
    "but then the other extremum can not be at the shared vertex and must be at the other unshared vertex .",
    "thus , as above , the two edges must be a ` mountain ' and a ` valley ' .    with opposite signs confirmed for the stress factors on the two new edges , we look now at the infinitesimal displacement induced by the infinitesimal deformation of the pseudo - triangulation on these same edges .",
    "for the framework with two new edge orbits , the non - zero stress vector must be orthogonal on the image of the corresponding rigidity matrix .",
    "in particular , it must be orthogonal on the image vector obtained by evaluating the rigidity matrix on the infinitesimal displacement induced by the pseudo - triangulation .",
    "but all entries corresponding to ` old ' edge orbits , that is , edge orbits in the pseudo - triangulation , will be zero . with opposite stress signs for the two new edges",
    ", orthogonality requires the _ same _ sign for the two non - zero entries .",
    "this means : simultaneous infinitesimal expansion or simultaneous infinitesimal contraction .    by now , the following result has been established .",
    "[ edge12 ] let @xmath1 be a planar pseudo - triangulation .",
    "let two pairs of vertices be such that both corresponding distances vary infinitesimally under the infinitesimal deformation of the pseudo - triangulation .",
    "assume that inserting the corresponding two edges ( and their @xmath124 orbits ) does not produce self - crossing .",
    "then , the two edges vary infinitesimally in the same way : both expand or both contract .",
    "l0.6     [ fig : bowmethod ]    as a final step to complete the proof of theorem [ thm : expansive ] , we want to remove the assumption that the two new edges maintain the non - crossing nature of the periodic framework , and thus to prove the full expansive character of the pseudo - triangulation mechanism .",
    "in fact , because we are comparing the stresses and infinitesimal flexes of pairs of edges , it suffices to assume that the first one is not crossing the rest , hence we only need to remove the non - crossing assumption for the second inserted edge .",
    "figure  [ fig : bowmethod ] illustrates the ( descending ) inductive step whereby stress considerations in a situation where an edge intersects several other edges can be reduced to an equivalent situation without self - crossing . in @xcite",
    "the procedure is called bow s method .",
    "we briefly review the nature of the argument by explaining the stress correspondence for the step shown in figure  [ fig : bowmethod ] .",
    "a new vertex has been inserted at the last crossing of the marked edge vectors . with obvious notations",
    "( by which an edge @xmath297 is split into two edges @xmath298 and @xmath299 , and similarly for the edge @xmath201 ) , we have , for the corresponding edge vectors : @xmath300    geometric stress conditions at the new vertex require @xmath301    and the correspondence of stresses ( valid for periodic stresses as well ) is expressed through the formulae :    @xmath302    with all other stress factors ( on edges different from @xmath297 and @xmath201 ) remaining the same .",
    "relations ( [ bow ] ) show that in this isomorphic correspondence of stresses , the sign of the stress factors along the fragmented edges is the same as in the initial framework , hence the argument given in lemma  [ edge2 ] carries over .",
    "thus , whether crossing or not crossing other edges , the insertion of a second new orbit of edges in a periodic pseudo - triangulation produces a stressed framework with opposite signs for the stress factors on the two added edge orbits .",
    "as shown , this implies the same type of infinitesimal variation of the two corresponding vertex distances when deforming the periodic pseudo - triangulation .",
    "the limit case , when the inserted edge passes through one or several vertices of the framework is treated similarly .",
    "in fact , the step for crossing through a vertex is simpler and only requires the splitting of the inserted edge into two edges .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem  [ thm : expansive ] .",

    "we retain from this section the conspicuous property of periodic pseudo - triangulations of maintaining the same deformation space under arbitrary relaxations of periodicity of finite index . we make use of this property in the final section , where we uncover the ultrarigidity of a family of frameworks obtained from pseudo - triangulations .",
    "we conclude the paper with two applications motivated by questions arising in materials science .",
    "periodic pseudo - triangulations determine a large , yet distinctive class of planar periodic frameworks .",
    "we have presented above some of their remarkable properties : their local deformation space is smooth and one - dimensional and this deformation path is _ expansive _ as long as the framework remains a pseudo - triangulation , that is , for the proper sense of variation of the parameter , all distances between pairs of vertices increase or stay the same .",
    "moreover , a relaxation of periodicity to a subgroup of finite index does not change these characteristics .    in this section",
    "we emphasize , from a _ purely geometric perspective _ , the relevance of periodic pseudo - triangulations and their expansive paths for what has been termed _ auxetic behavior _ in materials science .",
    "in materials science , the term _ auxetic _ , suggestive of increase or growth , refers to solids with a negative poisson s ratio @xcite . quoting from @xcite : _  a negative poisson s ratio in a solid defines the counter - intuitive lateral widening upon application of a longitudinal tensile strain . \" _ for anisotropic solids , such as single crystals , ",
    "the variation of elastic moduli with direction is also relevant \" ( _ ibid . _",
    "thus , auxetic behavior is primarily defined in terms of physical characteristics of the material under consideration . however , in many instances with pronounced geometric structural underpinnings , geometrical explanations have been proposed @xcite .    in our context , which is that of periodic frameworks and their deformations , we must rely on a comprehensive but strictly geometrical concept of auxetic path .",
    "this concept is introduced in our companion paper @xcite and will be briefly reviewed here .",
    "the geometric approach to auxetics presented in @xcite is formulated in arbitrary dimension @xmath303 and addresses one - parameter deformations of a given periodic framework in @xmath15 .",
    "two aspects may be emphasized from the start : ( i ) that when present , the auxetic property refers to the deformation path under consideration and not the framework itself , which oftentimes allows other deformation paths which need not be auxetic and",
    "( ii ) the auxetic character is an expression of a particular type of variation of the periodicity lattice along the deformation path .",
    "mathematically , we rely on the notion of _ contraction operator _ in a hilbert space , which we recall below . for our purposes , @xmath15 with the standard norm @xmath304 , will sufffice .",
    "let @xmath305 be a linear operator .",

    "it follows that contraction operators are characterized by the property of taking the unit ball to a subset of itself . for a _ strict contraction _ one requires @xmath310 .",

    "we prove the equivalence of this _ geometric criterion for auxetic paths _ with the following characterization involving the evolution of the gram matrix of a generating basis for the period lattice of the framework . with conventions already used in previous sections , after choosing an independent set of generators for @xmath124 , the image @xmath316 is completely described via the @xmath317 matrix @xmath318 with column vectors given by the images of the generators under @xmath319 .",

    "however , auxetic paths need not be expansive .",
    "as emphasized earlier , the auxetic property depends only on the curve @xmath321 and it will be enough to use the expansive property on one orbit of vertices . we have to verify that the operator @xmath314 which takes the period lattice basis @xmath329 to the period lattice basis @xmath330 is a contraction for @xmath331    let us observe that in the unit ball of @xmath15 , the vectors with rational coordinates relative to the basis @xmath329 give a dense subset . since some integer multiple of such a point is a period at moment @xmath332 , and this period , as a distance between two vertices in a vertex orbit , can only decrease or preserve its norm when mapped by @xmath314 to the corresponding period at moment @xmath333 , we see that a dense subset of points in the unit ball must be mapped to the unit ball .",
    "this is enough to conclude that @xmath308 .",
    "the fact that small auxetic deformations need not be expansive is to be expected from the fact that the relative motion of different vertex orbits is not sufficiently constrained by the auxetic property .",
    "a simple example is offered by the kagome framework in dimension two .",
    "the kagome framework is a familiar planar example and has been explored from various points of view @xcite .",
