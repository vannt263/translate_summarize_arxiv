    "the purpose of this paper is to compare energy loss and @xmath0-broadening for relativistic heavy quarks passing through a hot perturbative qcd plasma with that of the trailing string description@xcite for a hot sym plasma .",
    "we shall see that for energy loss in infinite extent matter the formulas for perturbative qcd and for a strongly coupled @xmath1 sym theory are parametrically identical when expressed in terms of the relevant saturation momentum , @xmath2",
    ". for @xmath0-broadening the sym result is parametrically identical to a ( subdominant ) perturbative qcd term which in the strong coupling limit of sym theory becomes the leading term .",
    "this comparison in infinite matter is then extended to finite extent matter where the trailing string picture has not yet been developed .",
    "we find results identical with infinite matter when expressed in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "we have not attempted comparison with a competitive theory of energy loss @xcite based on a wilson loop calculation because that approach is essentially perturbative with the sym theory only being used to give an evaluation of the transport coefficient , @xmath3 .    in this introduction",
    "we motivate and summarize our results . in sec .",
    "[ compare ] , these results are described in more detail with additional details and supporting evidence for our picture given in sec .",
    "[ distribution ] , [ exact ] and [ tensor ] .",
    "we begin by recalling the picture of energy loss for a relativistic heavy quark@xcite traveling through an infinite extent hot perturbative qcd plasma .",
    "we suppose the heavy quark to have rapidity @xmath4 at the time over which we focus .",
    "the heavy quark has a cloud of gluons , labeled by energy @xmath5 and transverse momentum @xmath6 .",
    "energy loss is dominated by the maximum energy gluons which are freed , or radiated , in the plasma@xcite .",
    "gluons are freed if their transverse momentum is less than the saturation momentum corresponding to the gluon coherence time , @xmath7 .",
    "this immediately gives @xmath8 where we have used @xmath9 as the relevant coherence time .",
    "the condition @xmath10 as well as @xmath11 converts eq .",
    "( [ heavy ] ) to a more standard form .",
    "the @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ heavy ] ) is just the probability of having a gluon , in the kinematic regime in question , in the heavy quark wavefunction .",
    "we now note that eq .",
    "( [ heavy ] ) is also true for a strong coupling @xmath1 sym plasma if the replacement @xmath13 is made , where @xmath14 , and if the saturation momentum is now taken as @xmath15 as found in ref .",
    "( the stronger dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath17 in sym theory , as compared to perturbative qcd , comes about because high energy scattering in sym theory is dominated by a @xmath18 singularity rather than the @xmath19 singularity in perturbative qcd . ) at first sight",
    "it may seem strange that a perturbative picture , giving eq .",
    "( [ heavy ] ) , could also lead to a correct result for a strongly coupled @xmath1 sym theory .",
    "however , we know that for a static heavy quark in the vacuum the distribution of energy in the fields surrounding the center of the heavy quark is the same for strong coupling sym theory and for qcd , or even qed@xcite . as we show in sec .",
    "[ distribution ] , this leads to an energy distribution in momentum space for a high energy heavy quark in sym theory exactly as in qcd when one replaces @xmath12 by @xmath20 .",
    "the saturation momentum then determines the scale at which quanta in the heavy quark wavefunction are freed in the plasma , and this is the only dynamics necessary to get the parametric form eq .",
    "( [ heavy ] ) .",
    "further evidence for this picture comes from @xmath0-broadening of a heavy quark in infinite extent matter . in qcd",
    "this broadening occurs mainly by direct multiple scattering of the heavy quark by thermal quanta@xcite .",
    "there is a subdominant effect , down by @xmath12 , where the heavy quark gets increased transverse momentum by radiation of gluons .",
    "however , in strong coupling sym theory @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath20 and now radiation becomes dominant .",
    "thus by simply allowing the emissions which give the energy loss to have a random transverse momentum , whose size is fixed to be that of the saturation momentum , one arrives at a dominant form for @xmath0-broadening in @xmath1 sym theory ( see eq .",
    "( [ ptb5 ] ) ) which is the same as that for radiative broadening in qcd and which agrees with calculations done using the trailing string picture .",
    "calculations of small oscillations on the trailing string@xcite lead one to identifying a point on the string which corresponds to a horizon on the metric induced on the worldsheet of the trailing string as it moves through the qcd plasma .",
    "this horizon corresponds to a @xmath21value ( see the metric eq .",
    "( [ metric1 ] ) ) equal to @xmath22 which is the same as the value of the saturation momentum for the heavy quark in the plasma . in our picture",
    "all quanta in the heavy quark having transverse momenta less than @xmath23 are freed while those having transverse momenta greater than @xmath2 remain part of the heavy quark . in sec .",
    "[ tensor ] , we verify that the part of the trailing string having @xmath24 corresponds to energy which spatially lies very close to the center of the heavy quark while the @xmath25 part of the trailing string corresponds to energy lagging too far behind the heavy quark center to be considered part of it .",
    "this part of the trailing string corresponds to waves in the plasma , and this matches our interpretation in terms of quanta which have been freed from the wavefunction of the heavy quark .",
    "we also note that @xmath26 is the same point as that identified in ref .  @xcite as separating branching in the vacuum , @xmath24 , from branching in the medium , @xmath25 . in the trailing string picture",
    "this agrees with our interpretation of the @xmath24 part of the string as being the same as that of a heavy quark in the vacuum while the @xmath25 part of the string is interpreted as quanta separate from the heavy quark .",
    "energy loss in finite matter is more subtle in both qcd and in @xmath1 sym theory .",
    "the first issue that arises is whether a heavy quark going through a finite extent of matter is `` bare '' or `` dressed''@xcite .",
    "if the heavy quark does not have too large a rapidity , @xmath27 in a sym plasma , then the matter is effectively infinite extent and we are back to our earlier discussion .",
    "however , if @xmath28 is large there is a strong distinction between bare and dressed heavy quarks .",
    "a dressed heavy quark is one that has its gluon cloud completely developed as it enters the medium . in the trailing string picture",
    "a vertical string going from @xmath29 to @xmath30 entering the medium traveling at rapidity @xmath4 corresponds to a dressed quark entering the medium . for",
    "a dressed heavy quark energy loss simply corresponds to freeing those quanta having transverse momentum less than @xmath2 , with the length determining @xmath2 being given by the length @xmath31 of the matter . in the case of the trailing string it , parametrically , corresponds to freeing all the string lying below @xmath32 .",
    "the result , eq .  ( [ eloss6 ] ) , takes the same form for a qcd plasma and for a sym plasma .    for bare quarks",
    "we are faced with a more serious challenge . in qcd",
    "one can simply produce a heavy quark - antiquark pair in a hard collision and then allow , say , the heavy quark to go through the medium .",
    "in sym theory consider a heavy quark - antiquark pair initially at rest and very close together .",
    "we then rapidly accelerate the quark and antiquark in opposite directions using an external electric field .",
    "when the quark has reached the desired rapidity we turn off the electric field and let the quark continue to pass through the medium .",
    "we have found an exact solution for the motion of the string during the period of acceleration , and this solution is described in sec .  [ exact ] and in ref .",
    "one can see from this solution , and the discussion in sec .",
    "[ compare ] , that now the heavy quark is missing much of its cloud of quanta as it passes through the medium .",
    "the key to determining medium induced energy loss is an understanding of the time at which components of the final dressed heavy quark are formed . in qcd",
    "this is well understood . in sec .",
    "[ compare ] we motivate , but ultimately conjecture that the formation times are the same for strong coupling sym theory and perturbative qcd .",
    "this leads to an energy loss formula as in eq .",
    "( [ heavy ] ) for qcd and the same , with @xmath13 , for sym theory but where now @xmath33 in perturbative qcd and @xmath34 for hot sym matter .",
    "we note in passing that the induced energy loss for hot sym matter goes as the cube of the length of the material in contrast to a quadratic law in qcd@xcite while the total @xmath35 picked up traversing the medium goes like @xmath36 for hot sym matter instead of the linear dependence on @xmath31 in hot perturbative qcd@xcite .",
    "in this section we give a detailed comparison of results on energy loss and @xmath37-broadening for a heavy quark in qcd with corresponding results in @xmath1 sym theory .",
    "although the results for the strong coupling sym theory have been derived ( in some cases the derivations will be given for the first time in later section of this paper . ) using the ads / cft correspondence@xcite with the sym theory , we here emphasize the comparison of qcd directly with the sym theory .",
    "we rely on explicit calculations on the string theory side of the correspondence to give confirmation of the basic validity of our picture .",
    "we start with energy loss in infinite hot matter where both the qcd and sym theory results are well known .",
    "what we are here noting is that when expressed in terms of the relevant saturation momentum , the results for qcd and sym are essentially identical for energy loss , however , the physical picture for @xmath0-broadening differs in these two theories .      consider a heavy quark of mass @xmath38 passing through hot matter of temperature @xmath39 .",
    "we suppose @xmath40 .",
    "suppose at some time the heavy quark is moving at rapidity @xmath4 so that its energy is @xmath41 .",
    "we also assume , for reasons to be explained below , that @xmath42 with the @xmath3 the transport coefficient of the plasma .",
    "the dominant cause of energy loss of the heavy quark is gluon radiation@xcite induced by the medium , at least when @xmath43 which is the region with which we shall be concerned .",
    "induced gluon radiation is caused by gluons in the wavefunction of the heavy quark being freed by interaction with the medium .",
    "suppose a gluon in the quark s wavefunction has energy @xmath5 and transverse momentum @xmath6 .",
    "such a gluon will be radiated if @xmath44 with @xmath2 the saturation momentum of the medium corresponding to a length given by the coherence time , @xmath7 , of the gluon .",
    "the energy loss will be dominated by gluons having @xmath6 , and @xmath45 , as large as possible .",
    "thus , setting @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 and using @xmath48 gives @xmath49 gluons having @xmath50 are strongly suppressed in the heavy quark wavefunction@xcite",
    ". taking @xmath51 will give the maximum energy and , combined with eq .",
    "( [ qhat ] ) , gives @xmath52 as the relevant saturation momentum .",
    "now we see why it is necessary to keep @xmath53 , because this is the condition that @xmath54 , which condition is the essential requirement separating heavy quark from light quark radiation dynamics .",
    "now it is a straightforward task to give a parametric form of the rate of energy loss of a heavy quark passing through a plasma as @xmath55 the @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eloss1 ] ) corresponds to the number of gluons , in the relevant kinematic domain , in the quark wavefunction while @xmath17 corresponds to the time over which the gluon energy , @xmath5 , is emitted . using eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) gives @xmath57 where , @xmath2 should be evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ qs ] ) .",
    "the difference between heavy and light quarks lies not in changing eq .",

    "( [ qs ] ) which for light quarks energy loss becomes @xmath58 with @xmath59 the energy of the light quark .",
    "the problem of energy loss for heavy quarks in a @xmath1 sym plasma has been well studied@xcite .",
    "using the ads / cft correspondence allows one to evaluate the energy loss in terms of the energy flowing toward the horizon through a string which goes from a @xmath60 brane , whose position is given by the heavy quark mass , toward the horizon of the metric .",

    "the @xmath60 brane is located at a position @xmath65 which is related to the heavy quark s mass by @xmath66 corresponding to a string at rest in the vacuum having length @xmath65 , as it falls straight down from @xmath65 to @xmath29 in the fifth dimension .",
    "the energy density of the string is @xmath67 in eqs .",
    "( [ mass ] ) and ( [ e - d ] ) , @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 .",
    "in the energy loss problem one keeps the string moving at a constant rapidity @xmath4 where one imagines an external constant `` electric '' field acting on the end of the string on the @xmath60 brane and furnishing the force necessary to keep the string moving at constant velocity @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "the resulting rate of energy loss , that is the rate of work done by the external electric field , is@xcite @xmath72 where we have only consider the case @xmath43 .",
    "we are now going to show that eq .",
    "( [ eloss3 ] ) agrees with eq .",
    "( eloss2 ) if one uses the saturation momentum appropriate to the @xmath1 sym plasma instead of eq .",
    "( [ qs ] ) . to get the replacement of eq .",
    "( [ qs ] ) for the sym plasma , we recall that the saturation momentum corresponding to a length @xmath31 of such a plasma is@xcite @xmath73 using @xmath17 in eq .",

    "( [ eloss3 ] ) , one arrives at @xmath76 except for the replacement of @xmath12 by @xmath77 eq .",
    "( [ eloss2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eloss4 ] ) are the same . the replacement of @xmath78 by @xmath77 is to be expected and already occurs in comparing the static energy density , the electric field squared , of a heavy quark in qcd with that of a heavy quark in @xmath1 sym theory . as we show in sec .",
    "[ distribution ] , this naturally leads a gluon distribution in a heavy quark to be the same in qcd and in @xmath1 sym theory except for the replacement of @xmath79 by @xmath77 .",
    "our picture of energy loss of a heavy quark in an infinite plasma is thus essentially identical in qcd and in @xmath1 sym .",
    "we do note , however , that we do not have control of constant factors in our description of energy loss in a @xmath1 sym plasma .",
    "the picture of transverse momentum broadening of a high energy quark in qcd is very simple and is the same for light quarks as for heavy quarks@xcite . as the quark passes through the plasma , it interacts with quanta of the plasma through multiple single gluon exchange , each exchange giving a random transverse momentum to the quark , and two gluon exchanges , necessary to keep probability conservation .",
    "the formula @xmath80 gives the rate of increase in the typical @xmath81 that the quark picks up in passing through the medium in terms of the transport coefficient of medium .",
    "one can also write this relation as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the saturation momentum of a length , @xmath84 , of the medium where we do not distinguish between time and length intervals for our relativistic heavy quark .",
    "the result given in eq .",
    "( [ ptb1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ptb2 ] ) comes completely from random multiple scattering of the quark in the medium .",
    "there is also a contribution from emission of gluons stimulated by the medium .",
    "the same gluon emissions which give the energy loss indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eloss2 ] ) naturally give a @xmath0-broadening @xmath85 eq .",
    "( [ ptb3 ] ) is perhaps obvious once one writes eq .",
    "( [ eloss2 ] ) in the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is given by eq .",
    "( [ qhat ] ) with the @xmath84 -dependence of @xmath23 given by eq .",
    "( [ tqs ] ) , identifying @xmath17 with @xmath84 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ ptb3 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eloss5 ] ) directly give the energy loss and transverse momentum broadening due to gluon radiation stimulated by the medium .",
    "the contribution of eq .",
    "( [ ptb3 ] ) is usually neglected because it is parametrically smaller than the contribution given in eq .",
    "( [ ptb2 ] ) from multiple scattering .",
    "however , as we shall see below in a sym plasma , transverse momentum broadening of a heavy quark is dominated by gluon radiation because @xmath12 will be replaced by the large parameter , @xmath88 .",
    "the calculation of transverse momentum broadening in a sym plasma is done in terms of fluctuations on the corresponding string on the gravity side of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the result is@xcite @xmath89 if we identify the saturation momentum @xmath23 as in eq .",
    "( [ qseta ] ) , then one can write @xmath90 or , alternatively , as @xmath91 where , again , we identify @xmath84 with @xmath17 the coherence time of the gluons whose emission dominates both the energy loss and transverse momentum broadening of the heavy quark .",
    "( [ ptb6 ] ) is identical , after @xmath92 , with eq .",
    "( [ ptb3 ] ) adding confirmation to our picture of energy loss and @xmath0-broadening as due to gluon emission in the sym plasma .",
    "once one writes formulas in terms of the relevant saturation momentum , the sym and qcd pictures become identical . of course , in the case of @xmath0-broadening what is a subdominant effect in qcd , gluon emission , becomes dominant in the sym plasma .",
    "our picture of infinite extent plasmas has been that a heavy quark loses energy and gets transverse momentum broadening by the emission of gluons having transverse momentum equal to the saturation momentum of the medium corresponding to a medium length given by the coherence length of the emitted gluons which carry the same rapidity as the parent heavy quark .",
    "now we are going to identify this picture more closely with the trailing string picture .    in the trailing string picture , a heavy quark moving at constant rapidity through a sym plasma correponds to a string moving at the same rapidity in the background metric , eq .  ( [ metric1 ] ) on the ads side of the correspondence .",
    "the shape of the string is@xcite @xmath93    \\label{shape}\\]]where @xmath94with @xmath38 the mass of the heavy quark . in our picture , the parts of the string having @xmath95 correspond to gluons actually in the heavy quark while those parts of the string having @xmath96 correspond to freed matter which is no longer part of the heavy quark .",
    "the flow of energy past the point @xmath97 with @xmath2 given as in eq .",
    "( [ qseta ] ) , corresponds to the freeing of gluons from the heavy quark and into qcd plasma .",
    "let us now see that @xmath98 is a natural point on the string for separating the heavy quark from waves in the plasma .",
    "let @xmath99 be the distance between a point on the trailing string and a corresponding point on a string , having the same motion at @xmath100 , moving in the vacuum .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ shape ] ) for @xmath101 large , one easily finds @xmath102 now we expect that the range of z - values allowed in a heavy quark moving at velocity @xmath70 in the vacuum is given by @xmath103 where the first factor on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dz2 ] ) is the infrared - ultraviolet correspondence while the second factor is due to lorentz contraction .",
    "those region of @xmath101 having @xmath104 can naturally be part of the heavy quark while those region of @xmath101 having @xmath105 lag too far behind the core of the heavy quark to be part of it .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ dz1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ dz2 ] ) , we see that the separation point , up to constant factor of order one , is given by eq .",
    "( [ qs2 ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ tensor ] , we give a more complete discussion of this issue where , instead of relying on eq .",
    "( [ dz2 ] ) , we compare the four - dimensional energy - momentum tensor for a trailing string with that of the string corresponding to a heavy quark moving in the vacuum and reach the same conclusion as above .",
    "another argument for eq .",
    "( [ qs2 ] ) as the natural separation point between what belongs to the heavy quark and what has been freed into the medium comes from the calculation of transverse momentum broadening from small fluctuation on the trailing string . in the differential equation governing",
    "the small fluctuations @xmath32 is a regular singular point which corresponds to a horizon of the metric on the worldsheet of the string@xcite .",
    "waves on the worldsheet of the string going from large @xmath101 can disappear into the horizon but one requires that waves not come out of the horizon toward large values of @xmath101.@xcite      in dealing with hot matter of finite length in qcd , the energy loss problem is very different for dressed and bare quarks . for heavy ion collisions where high transverse momentum quarks are produced in the collision as bare quarks , without the accompanying gluon cloud which characterize a dressed quark , the dressed quark energy loss problem is of little interest .",
    "nevertheless we begin with this problem in our discussion of finite matter because it is relatively straightforward .",
    "the situation is as follows : a high energy heavy quark prepared at early times impinges on a target of hot matter , say a cube , of length @xmath31 .",
    "we wish to determine how much energy is lost and how much transverse momentum broadening occurs as the heavy quark passes through the medium . if the rapidity of the heavy quark is such that @xmath27(for qcd the condition is @xmath107 ) , then the coherence time of all the gluons in the heavy quark is much less than @xmath31 and the matter is effectively of infinite extent .",
    "thus , we consider here only the opposite case where @xmath108 . we also suppose @xmath109 so that a small fraction of the heavy quark s energy is lost as it passes through the matter .",
    "when @xmath108 , the picture is essentially the same in qcd and for a sym plasma .",
    "gluons in the heavy quark wavefunction having @xmath110 will be freed in passing through the matter while those having @xmath111 are not freed . since the gluons which dominate the energy loss have @xmath112",
    ", the energy loss will be @xmath113 with @xmath12 referring to qcd and @xmath77 to the sym case . for sym the result eq .",
    "( [ eloss6 ] ) agrees with eq .",

    "( [ qsl ] ) is used for @xmath2 . for qcd the result eq .",
    "( [ eloss6 ] ) differs from the case of infinite matter , and we remark that we have not subtracted the `` factorization term''@xcite .",
    "we emphasize , however , that when written in terms of the saturation momentum the qcd and sym results are of the same form once one makes the @xmath114 identification in passing between theories .    for transverse momentum broadening the formulas",
    "are @xmath115 where again the upper value is for qcd while the lower value is for a sym plasma .",
    "the qcd result is the same as eq .",
    "( [ ptb1 ] ) for infinite matter while the sym result takes the same form as infinite matter , as given in eq .",

    "( [ qsl ] ) for @xmath16 . the argumentation leading to eq .",
    "( [ ptb7 ] ) is identical to that giving eq .",
    "( [ eloss6 ] ) and , again , here in the sym plasma transverse momentum broadening is radiation dominated .",
    "the quarks , whether light or heavy , that are produced in hard collisions in a relativistic heavy ion collision are initially bare , that is they have been produced without the gluon cloud that accompanies a quark which is part of a high energy hadron . while the energy loss of bare quarks has been widely discussed in the qcd literature@xcite ,",
    "it has so far not been treated in the literature on the sym plasma . on the string theory side of the ads / cft correspondence , in order to create a heavy quark which is initially bare it is necessary to consider a heavy quark - antiquark pair initially with little or no separation and then rapidly accelerate the quark and the antiquark in opposite direction by , say , an electric field @xmath116 which is constant in space and time and points along the @xmath117-axis . after a rapid acceleration over a time @xmath118 , the electric field can be turned off and one has a quark - antiquark pair with large relative energy in a situation similar to that occurring in a hard collision@xcite .",
    "we have found an exact solution which satisfies the equations coming from the nambu - goto action for the quark - antiquark pair accelerating in the vacuum .",

    "we will show that , for a relativistic heavy particle , the classical result for the energy density in momentum space agrees with the quantum perturbative calculation to lowest order .",
