    "majorana fermion is a real fermion that is its own antiparticle@xcite . because of its exotic properties and the possible exotic statistics@xcite , in condensed matter physics ,",
    "the search for majorana fermions ( mfs ) has attracted increasing interests . a variety of schemes to realize mfs ( more accurately , majorana bound states ) have been proposed .",
    "a possible approach is to create a quantized vortex ( @xmath1-flux ) in the @xmath0-wave topological superconductors ( sc ) that traps mfs in vortex - core@xcite .",
    "then , it is known that the quantized vortex in two dimensional ( 2d ) topological sc with nonzero chern number hosts a mf with exact zero energy .",
    "another different approach to realize mfs is to consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) electronic nano - structures proximity - coupled to a bulk superconductor@xcite , of which the unpaired majorana fermions appear as the end - states .",
    "then , based on this idea , several schemes are proposed to realize mfs that appear as the end - states of line - defects in 2d non - topological scs@xcite .    to describe the majorana zero mode , a real fermion field called majorana fermion @xmath2 $ ] ( @xmath3 ) is introduced .",
    "we consider a 2d gapped sc with a pair of majorana modes with nearly zero energies , of which the corresponding mfs are denoted by @xmath4 @xmath5 . to describe the subspace of the system with two nearly degenerate states , the fermion - parity operator @xmath6 is introduced . since @xmath7 , @xmath8 has two eigenvalues @xmath9 called even and odd fermion - parities , respectively .",
    "generally , there exists the coupling between two mfs and the effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the coupling constant .",
    "the quantum systems with multi - mfs ( we call this lattice model to be _ majorana lattice model _ ) show nontrivial topological properties , including a nonvanishing chern number , chiral majorana edge state@xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the majorana lattice model is really an induced `` topological superconductor '' on the parent tsc .",
    "a question arises , `` _ _",
    "do mfs in different topological superconductors belong to the same class ? _ _ '' without no detectable degree of freedoms ( mfs have zero energy , zero charge , zero spin ) , it is believed that mfs have `` _ _ no hair _ _ '' .",
    "therefore , it was believed that all mfs in different models are same and belong to the same class . in this paper",
    "we point out that in 2d topological systems , mfs do have `` hair '' , that is the number of quantized vortex , a topological degree of freedom . as a result , there exist _ two _ universal classes of mfs : mfs binding a @xmath1-flux and those with no flux - binding .",
    "we then introduce a topological value to characterize the two classes of mfs and propose an ( indirect ) numerical approach to identify the class of mfs in topological systems .",
    "our basis is the fact that multi - mfs with @xmath1-flux may be topologically different from those with no flux - binding in the fermion - parity of the ground states and the order of quantum phase transitions . by calculating a dimensionless parameter , the gap ratio ( see discussion below )",
    ", the quantum number of the mfs becomes an _",
    "`` quantity '' .",
    "we begin by giving the definitions of two classes of mfs in 2d topological systems .",
    "one class contains the usual mfs without flux - binding ( we call this class _ normal mfs _ ) ; the other class contains composite objects of an mf together with a @xmath1-flux ( we call this class _ topological mfs _ ) . see the illustrations of the two classes of mfs in fig.[fig1].(a ) and fig.[fig3].(a ) .",
    "we consider a system with coupled mfs .",
    "the coupling strength is just the energy splitting from the intervortex quantum tunneling .",
    "we call this effective description as the majorana lattice model , of which the tight - binding hamiltonian can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hopping amplitude from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , and satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is a majorana operator ( @xmath18 ) obeying anti - commutate relation @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is a gauge factor .",
    "thus , the total number of majorana modes @xmath21 must be even and then we can divide the majorana lattice into two sublattices .",
    "the pair @xmath22 denotes the summation that runs over all the nearest neighbor ( nn ) pairs ( with hopping amplitude @xmath11 ) and all the next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) pairs ( with hopping amplitude @xmath23 ) .",
    "each triangular plaquette possesses @xmath24 quantum flux effectively .",
    "this hamiltonian allows different @xmath25 gauge choices ( sign rules ) @xmath26 . from the theory of projective symmetry group ,",
    "there are two possible gauge choices ( sign rules ) that correspond to two different classes of mfs : topological mfs obey a _",
    "topological polygon sign rule ; _ normal mfs obey a _",
    "normal polygon sign rule_. according to topological polygon sign rule for topological mfs , there exists an extra phase related to a closed path that forms a polygon , given by half the sum of the interior angles of the polygon@xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) topological mfs on a ring , there exists @xmath29 ( @xmath24 ) flux inside the ring ; for @xmath30 topological mfs on a ring , there is no flux inside the ring . on the contrary , according to normal polygon sign rule for normal mfs , there also exists an extra phase related to a closed path that forms a polygon .",
    "however , for @xmath28 normal mfs on a ring , there exists @xmath24 flux inside the ring and for @xmath27 or @xmath30 normal mfs on a ring , there is no flux inside the ring .",

    "a numerical approach was proposed to identify the polygon sign rule of the mfs by looking for the signature of a first order tqpt of multi - mfs . applying the approach to study several 2d topological systems",
    ", we found that vortex - induced mfs in 2d strong topological scs ( a @xmath0 topological superconductor in sec.vi.a and an s - wave topological superconductor with rashba spin - orbital coupling in sec.vi.b ) obey topological polygon sign rule and line - defect - induced mfs in 2d weak topological scs ( nanowire - sc hybridization system in sec.vi.c , p - wave superconductor on honeycomb lattice in sec.vi.d ) obey normal polygon sign rule ."
