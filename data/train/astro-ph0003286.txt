    "shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) predicted that the inner portions of accretion disks that extend into relativistically - deep gravitational potentials should be radiation pressure - dominated when the accretion rate is greater than a modest fraction of the eddington rate . in that regime",
    ", they found that disks could achieve hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction if the local dissipation rate were proportional to the local mass density .",
    "given that assumption , upward radiation flux could support the disk matter against gravity if the density were essentially constant as a function of height ( falling sharply to zero at the top surface ) and the radiation pressure fell gradually from the disk midplane to the surface .    soon",
    "after this equilibrium was discovered , it was found to suffer from several sorts of instabilities .",
    "lightman & eardley ( 1974 ) pointed out that if the viscous stress is proportional to the total pressure ( in this case , dominated by radiation ) , perturbations with radial wavelengths long compared to the vertical thickness @xmath0 , but short compared to a radius @xmath1 , grow on the ( comparatively long ) viscous inflow timescale .",
    "shakura & sunyaev ( 1976 ) then observed that in these conditions perturbations in the same range of wavelengths would also grow on the ( shorter ) thermal timescale .",
    "bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov ( 1977 ) noticed that if the radiation is locked to the gas even on short lengthscales ( i.e. , if , for the purpose of dynamics , the optical depth is treated as effectively infinite ) , such disks should be convectively unstable , for the specific entropy decreases outward ; the linear growth rate for convective  bubbles \" was worked out by lominadze & chagelishvili ( 1984 ) .",
    "more recently , gammie ( 1998 ) has demonstrated that a magnetic field in radiation - supported disks can catalyze a short - wavelength ( @xmath2 ) overstable wave mode . in view of these instabilities , it has long been a puzzle just what sort of equilibrium would actually be found in nature when the accretion rate is high enough that radiation pressure - domination might be expected ( see , e.g. shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ; liang 1977 ; coroniti 1981 ; svensson & zdziarski 1994 ; szuszkiewicz & miller 1997 ; krolik 1998 ) .    in this paper , we take a closer look at the nature of the short wavelength modes in radiation - supported disks without magnetic fields . our goal ( motivated by a companion work on radiation - hydrodynamics simulations of such disks : agol & krolik 2000b ) is to examine more closely which modes can be expected to grow most quickly , what happens when finite optical depth permits some photon diffusion , and what role , if any , is played by associated perturbations in the local dissipation rate .",
    "we begin by writing down the equations of non - relativistic radiation hydrodynamics so that we may first describe the equilibrium in this language , and then discuss linear perturbations to this equilibrium . because we are interested in accretion disks",
    ", it is convenient to write them in a rotating frame .",
    "the first is the usual equation of mass conservation : @xmath3 our notation is the usual one , in which @xmath4 is the mass density and @xmath5 is the fluid velocity .",
    "next is the the fluid force equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gas pressure , @xmath8 is the local gravity , @xmath9 is the opacity per unit mass , @xmath10 is the radiation flux , and @xmath11 is the rotation rate of the fluid .",
    "although all the fluid quantities are defined in the rotating frame , the radiation quantities ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) are defined in the frame of the local fluid motion , i.e. including any departures from corotation ( mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) .",
    "note that we have omitted magnetic forces .",
    "for the two equations describing radiation energy density and momentum density , we follow buchler ( 1979 ) , but write the lagrangian time derivatives explicitly , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 . the evolution of radiation energy density @xmath13 is described by : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the radiation pressure tensor and @xmath16 is the net local emissivity .",
    "finally , there is the equation describing the time - dependence of the radiation momentum density @xmath17 : @xmath18 in this equation , @xmath19 is the identity matrix and @xmath20 is the net rate per unit volume at which photon momentum is created by radiation ( usually negative in the fluid frame because photon momentum is lost due to opacity , while newly - created photons are usually isotropic in the fluid frame ) .    in the equilibrium , @xmath21 . to isolate the effect of radiation support",
    ", we also take the extreme limit of @xmath22 .",
    "if we regard the rotation of the disk matter as cancelling the radial component of gravity , the only non - trivial remark to make about the equilibrium is that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the local vertical component of gravitational acceleration [ in a thin disk , @xmath25 for central mass @xmath26 .",
    "now consider perturbed versions of equations ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) . in order to write these perturbations in fourier - transform form",
    "( i.e. , for any quantity @xmath27 , the perturbation is @xmath28 ) , we will suppose that the wavevectors obey three conditions : that @xmath29 ; that @xmath30 ; and that @xmath31 .",
    "the first limit means that the diffusion approximation applies , i.e. @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 .",
    "the second is the wkb approximation , as applied to variations in both the radial and vertical directions .",
    "note that we further restrict our attention to axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "the condition @xmath34 also means that we can ignore any gradients in the gravity or equilibrium radiation flux .",
    "in addition , assuming @xmath35 allows us to neglect the terms in vector divergences arising from cylindrical geometry .",
    "for example , after fourier - transforming , @xmath36 becomes @xmath37 .",
    "we then find : @xmath38 the second and third equations in this set are the two components of the fluid force equation , with the vertical component reduced by the fact that the radiation flux exactly balances gravity in the equilibrium .",
    "the last three equations are the three components of the radiation flux equation .",
    "these equations may be further simplified by the assumption ( verifiable _ post hoc _ ) that @xmath39 ; that is , the wave frequency is very small compared to the mean time between photon scattering events . with the further approximation that @xmath40 , equations ( 5 )  ( 12 ) may be manipulated to yield a dispersion relation .",
    "this relation is most conveniently displayed in terms of dimensionless quantities , so that @xmath41 and @xmath42 . to satisfy the wkb approximation , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the dispersion relation is then seen to depend on six dimensionless combinations of parameters : @xmath45 note that here @xmath46 is @xmath47 , the _ local _ value of the vertical gravity . in any thin disk ,",
    "the quantity @xmath48 , for it is of order the free - fall speed from the top of the disk to the midplane in units of @xmath49 .",
    "the relative importance of rotational effects is given by @xmath50 , which is simply @xmath51 for keplerian rotation .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is also a function of height above the midplane . in an optically thick disk , @xmath53/(z / h)$ ] .",
    "thus , the two parameters @xmath52 and @xmath50 could be replaced by the single parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the last two dimensionless parameters describe the sensitivity of the dissipation to the radiation pressure and the density , respectively .",
    "if one could extrapolate the ",
    "@xmath55 \" prescription to local fluctuations , one might expect that @xmath56 .",
    "in terms of these dimensionless quantities , the dispersion relation is : @xmath57\\omega_{*}^4}\\\\ & - & \\left(4k_{*}^2 p + 3\\omega_{*}^2 + ik_{*z}^3/\\tau^2 - ik_{*z } g { \\cal q}_p /\\tau\\right)\\omega_{*}^3 \\\\ & + & \\left[4k_{*z}^3pg/\\tau - ik_{*}^2 \\omega_{*}^2/(g\\tau ) + i{\\cal q}_p ( -ik_{*z }",

    "the other four are given by : @xmath62/ k_{*}^2 \\cr}\\ ] ] the first pair of roots are the familiar radiation - supported sound waves .",
    "the second pair describe buoyancy behavior ( cf .",
    "balbus 1999 ) . if @xmath63 , there are two neutrally stable gravity ( epicyclic ) waves ; on the other hand , if @xmath64 , one mode is damped , but the other grows exponentially with essentially no oscillation .",
    "it is this last mode that corresponds to convection .",
    "although rotation tends to have a stabilizing effect , when @xmath65 one can always find a mode with @xmath66 large enough to satisfy this criterion . as a consequence , when radiation pressure dominates gas pressure in a very optically thick disk , the standard equilibrium is always unstable to convection .",
    "however , relatively strong rotational effects ( i.e. , @xmath67 relatively large , or location near the midplane ) do diminish the range of wavevector directions that is unstable .      as already remarked , both @xmath52 and @xmath68 are determined by @xmath54 , and both should be , except very near the midplane , @xmath69 .",
    "because the growth rate of the fastest growing mode in the optically thick limit is @xmath70 , and @xmath52 decreases upward , convective instability should develop most rapidly near the top of the disk .",
    "this expectation is borne out when the full equations are solved : as predicted by equation 20 , when @xmath71 , the growth rate is nearly independent of @xmath72 and is @xmath73 greater at @xmath74 than at @xmath75 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath76 in a radiation pressure - dominated shakura - sunyaev disk is @xmath77 where @xmath55 is the usual dimensionless stress parameter , @xmath78 is the accretion rate in eddington units for unit efficiency , @xmath79 is the radius in units of @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the opacity relative to pure thomson opacity , and @xmath82 are the relativistic corrections to the dissipation rate , torque , and vertical gravity ( page & thorne 1974 ; abramowicz , lanza & percival 1997 ; see also agol & krolik 2000a ) .",
    "because we expect @xmath83 , but @xmath79 must be @xmath84 , these disks should be optically thick .",
    "however , in the inner part of the disk , @xmath76 might be as little as @xmath85 .",
    "fig .  1 shows how the growth rate and phase velocity of the unstable convective modes depend on wavenumber and @xmath86 when there is no perturbation to the dissipation rate and the optical depth is very large ( @xmath87 ) . to illustrate the dependence on optical depth ,",
    "the same curves are shown in fig .  2 for a case with the smallest optical depth one might expect , @xmath88 .",
    "in both cases , the range of meaningful wavenumbers ( and hence the range of wavenumbers displayed in the figures ) is limited by two criteria . on the one hand ,",
    "the wkb approximation demands that @xmath34 ; on the other , the diffusion approximation is only consistent with @xmath89 .",
    "we present results extending out to @xmath90 ; at the highest wavenumbers shown , the diffusion approximation has only marginal validity .    for fixed optical depth , the growth rate depends on @xmath86 ; when @xmath91 , the unstable convective mode disappears . for smaller @xmath86 ( @xmath92 ) ,",
    "the growth rate is independent of @xmath86 . decreasing the optical depth reduces the extent of the `` flat '' portion of the growth rate curve for a given @xmath86 .",
    "however , the largest value of the dimensionless growth rate , @xmath93 , in the wavenumber range of physical interest is almost independent of @xmath76 over this range .    figs .",
    "1 and 2 also show the phase velocity of the unstable convective mode , normalized to the free fall speed in the disk . for large optical depths ,",
    "the real frequency of convective modes is so close to zero that they can be considered as non - oscillatory ; decreasing the optical depth towards the smallest value ( @xmath94 ) expected for radiation pressure dominated disks leads to an increase in the real frequency of the mode , endowing it with a non - negligible phase velocity and , as a consequence , it becomes oscillatory .    in the absence of perturbations to the dissipation rate ,",
    "finite ( although large ) optical depth primarily affects the radiation sound waves ( cf . agol & krolik 1998 ) .",
    "not surprisingly , as the opacity falls , short wavelength sound waves become damped .",
    "less intuitively , convective modes remain unstable even when the diffusion rate ( @xmath95 ) is larger than the characteristic frequency @xmath96 , i.e. when @xmath97 . in this regime ,",
    "epicyclic motions cause convective modes to acquire an oscillatory character .",
    "convection remains unstable even in the face of strong radiative diffusion because the equilibrium gas density is constant . a parcel that begins to fall because its specific entropy is too small",
    "is squeezed as it encounters higher pressure .",
    "its radiation pressure rises , but because diffusion is so effective , only up to the ambient level .",
    "meanwhile , however , the increased gas density means that the parcel s density exceeds that of its neighbors , and it continues to fall .",
    "such impunity to the effects of radiation diffusion does not persist all the way to zero opacity , however . when @xmath98 , the diffusion approximation is no longer a valid description of radiation transfer . for wavelengths that short ( or opacity that small ) , the radiation streams freely , entirely independent of gas motions . in that limit ,",
    "if there is nothing to alter the distribution of dissipation , there is no perturbation to the flux as a function of position , and therefore , no perturbation to the force .",
    "the result , of course , is that convection disappears .    again applying the shakura - sunyaev disk solution",
    ", we expect @xmath99 to be small , for it is given by @xmath100 @xmath99 becomes irrelevant over most of the wavenumber interval of interest when @xmath58 , as every factor in which it appears in the dispersion relation is divided by @xmath76 ; the value of @xmath99 can still have some influence even at large @xmath76 only for very large wavenumbers , @xmath101 , since some of those same terms of the dispersion relation actually are @xmath102 or even @xmath103 . however , even when @xmath76 is as large as @xmath104 , some dependence on @xmath99 begins to appear across the range of interesting wavenumbers .",
    "when the optical depth is no larger than this , diminishing @xmath99 tends to enhance instability , particularly at short wavelengths .",
    "when @xmath105 , the growth rate of the very short wavelength convective modes increases by factors of several when @xmath99 falls from @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "when @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , a second mode , in addition to the convective mode , becomes unstable at short wavelengths .",
    "this mode is weakly oscillatory , and its very low phase velocity ( @xmath110  @xmath111 the free fall velocity ) behaves similarly to that of damped radiation sound waves at the same wavelengths .",
    "analysis of the corresponding amplitudes of the various physical quantitities perturbations shows that this mode has magnitude and especially phase relationships between perturbations in pressure , density and velocity components that are intermediate between those of convective modes and those characteristic of radiation sound waves .",
    "it is important to note , however , that if the canonical disk solution applies , the product @xmath112 in other words , the product @xmath113 should be very nearly independent of radius ( if @xmath55 is ) .",
    "even where the relativistic corrections are substantial , @xmath113 hardly changes because @xmath114 and @xmath115 are very nearly proportional , and @xmath116 has a total range of at most a factor of two ( krolik 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the criterion for which scaled wavelengths should be substantially affected by photon diffusion ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) is almost independent of radius , but does depend somewhat on @xmath54 .    given our estimate of @xmath99 ( equation 22 ) , we can also verify our expectation that @xmath117 .",
    "rewritten in terms of our dimensionless parameters , this ratio is @xmath118 .",
    "as we have just estimated , @xmath48 and @xmath119 in radiation pressure - supported @xmath55-disks . consequently , unless @xmath120 is extremely large , @xmath117 is a very safe assumption .    as already pointed out , @xmath121 is much like a local version of the vertically - averaged quantity @xmath55 , the ratio of the @xmath1@xmath122 stress to the total pressure . on this basis",
    "we expect @xmath121 to be somewhat less than unity .",
    "the ( dimensional ) dissipation perturbation coefficient @xmath123 , on the other hand , is most closely related to the ratio of the flux to the surface density . in a shakura - sunyaev disk , this quantity ( reduced to a dimensionless number according to equation 18 ) , is @xmath124 although we do nt know for certain that @xmath125 , it is a likely estimator .",
    "on this basis , we expect @xmath126 , and should be particularly small at larger radius or in disks with relatively low accretion rate .    like @xmath76 , varying @xmath121 or @xmath127 affects the radiation sound waves much more than the convective modes .",
    "the growth rate of the near - zero real frequency convective mode is almost independent of @xmath121 and @xmath127 over a large range in these parameters , but the longer - wavelength radiation sound waves become unstable when these parameters are positive . for example , when @xmath128 , and @xmath119 , the growth rates for positive @xmath121 and null @xmath129 are @xmath130 , and , similarly , those for positive @xmath129 and null @xmath121 turn out to be @xmath131 .    unlike the convective mode , for radiation sound waves , growth persists to @xmath132 . although the maximum growth rate does not depend on the value of this ratio , the range of wavelengths for which growth occurs shrinks and moves towards larger wavelengths as the ratio @xmath66 decreases .",
    "smaller optical depth can also counteract the instability created by positive @xmath121 or @xmath127 ( see also agol & krolik 1998 for a discussion of radiation diffusion damping of mhd waves ) . in the very large @xmath76 limit , the maximum growth rate for radiation sound waves is almost independent of the value of the optical depth , but for @xmath133 it decreases with decreasing @xmath76 .",
    "the radiation sound waves are all damped for @xmath134 or so ; at larger optical depth , the shorter wavelength modes remain damped ( because , of course , diffusion is most effective acting on them ) , but growth appears for longer wavelengths , with the range of growing wavelengths stretching as @xmath76 increases . fig .",
    "3 shows the behaviour of the imaginary part of the frequency and the normalised phase velocity for radiation sound waves with @xmath135 and @xmath136 as functions of wavenumber for a variety of optical depths .    summarizing this discussion",
    ", we conclude that there are two sorts of instabilities of importance in radiation pressure - supported disks : convective instabilities , which grow on roughly the dynamical timescale , should be very nearly ubiquitous unless the disk becomes almost optically thin ; and radiation sound waves , which can be driven unstable ( at a slower rate ) if @xmath121 or @xmath127 is positive .      in standard treatments of convection in rotating fluids ( e.g. ,",
    "chandrasekhar 1961 ) , it is shown that convection begins when the  rayleigh number \" @xmath137 exceeds a critical value ( generally @xmath138 ) which depends on the  taylor number \" @xmath139 writing @xmath140 for the temperature , we define @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 is the thermal conductivity , and @xmath144 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "this analysis applies partially , but not entirely , to the circumstances of radiation - dominated accretion disks .",
    "the fact that , rather than entering the fluid solely at the bottom , heat is actually generated throughout the fluid probably alters the quantitative criteria for convective instability but should not change anything at a qualitative level . on the other hand ,",
    "certain contrasts are of greater importance .",
    "one that requires mention is that the pressure in these circumstances , unlike in classical fluids , depends only on the radiation , and is therefore independent of density .",
    "consequently , thermal diffusion can alter the pressure with no change in density . in the classical analog",
    ", thermal diffusion can quench convective instability by adding heat to falling low - entropy fluid elements , thereby forcing them to expand until their density no longer exceeds the surrounding density .",
    "this occurs when @xmath143 is large enough that @xmath145 falls below the critical value .",
    "by contrast , in the radiation - dominated case , the density remains unchanged in the face of thermal diffusion .",
    "this is why convection persists even when @xmath97 ; i.e. , the radiation analog of the rayleigh number does not accurately predict the effect of thermal diffusion on the instability .",
    "perhaps the most important contrast with classical fluids is that there is no easy definition of the kinematic viscosity .",
    "bulk orbital shear leads to angular momentum transfer via magnetic forces ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) ; these are , of course , entirely absent in our treatment .",
    "however , stresses arising from other shears may be quite different , whether they are caused by magnetic forces or other mechanisms ( for example , photon diffusion : agol & krolik 1998 ) .",
    "for this reason , it is unclear whether the conventional equation of the @xmath146 shear stress with a nominal viscosity ( as in the shakura - sunyaev @xmath55 formalism ) is appropriate here . in any event ,",
    "none of these possible viscosity mechanisms is present in our equations ; not even radiation viscosity is considered , for no radiation shear stress exists in the pure diffusion approximation .",
    "thus , in a formal sense , neither @xmath145 nor @xmath147 exists in our treatment of this problem .    nonetheless , having expressed these _ caveats _ , it is still of some interest to estimate what @xmath147 and @xmath145 may be in radiation - dominated accretion disks in order to make some contact with the classical theory .",
    "to do so we make the suspect identification discussed in the preceding paragraph : we suppose that the shear viscosity in all directions is given by the shakura - sunayev @xmath55 . if so , @xmath148 , independent of radius ( or anything else ) . within the radiation - dominated regime ,",
    "the rayleigh number is similarly constant : @xmath149 .",
    "interestingly , the critical @xmath145 for @xmath150 is @xmath151  @xmath152 ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) .",
    "thus , if the most appropriate analog to ordinary fluid viscosity is correctly estimated by this means , the strong convective instability we find might be quenched ; however , as we have stressed , it is by no means clear that this analogy applies .",
    "we have shown that if an accretion disk is placed in the shakura - sunyaev radiation - dominated equilibrium , the growth rate of the convective instability is hardly affected by large changes in parameters such as the opacity or the way in which the local dissipation might be perturbed .",
    "this behavior is , perhaps , not surprising , when one considers that the convective instability is essentially dynamical , whereas the opacity and dissipation rates pertain to the ( rather more slowly accomplished ) thermal balance .    given that the shakura - sunyaev equilibrium is unstable to convection for all reasonable parameters , we can hardly expect that it describes the actual state of radiation pressure - dominated disks .",
    "one s first guess might be that what happens instead is that entropy is redistributed so as to make the disks at most marginally unstable to convection ( bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ) . if the entropy distribution is at most weakly unstable to convection , then departures from hydrostatic equilbrium should be small , and the equilibrium could be determined by applying these two conditions ( i.e. isentropy and hydrostatic balance ) .",
    "however , marginal stability to convection also suggests that the amount of heat carried by convection is small , so that radiative diffusion dominates energy exchange .",
    "unfortunately , this condition is inconsistent with the first two .",
    "any two of these three conditions suffice to determine the equilibrium ; the solution is over - determined if all three are applied",
    ". the result must be , then , that in real disks none of them is satisfied exactly , but all three are approximately correct .",
    "the quantitative character of this balancing act can be determined only by detailed calculations that carry convection into the nonlinear regime ( e.g. agol & krolik 2000b ) .",
    "deviation from constant specific entropy can certainly be expected near the disk surface .",
    "there , radiation diffusion should be able to consistently dominate convection as a heat - loss mechanism because the diffusion time is much shorter than in the body of the disk .",
    "consequently , the specific entropy distribution near the surface must be clearly stable , i.e. rise with increasing altitude .",
    "the sense of heat redistribution by convection is to raise the specific entropy near the top and diminish it below .",
    "for the same reason that radiative diffusion must dominate near the top , this redistribution can have the side effect of changing the overall rate at which heat is able to leave the disk .",
    "the mean specific entropy in equilibrium is therefore not necessarily the same as the value predicted by the original shakura - sunyaev equilibrium .",
    "these remarks do not bear on whether the thermal and viscous instabilities continue to plague radiation - dominated disks .",
    "it is possible that convection might be able to remove extra heat generated in the course of the thermal instability , and might consequently be able to quench it .",
    "whether that is so can only be determined by detailed calculation of heat transport by convection in the nonlinear regime ( agol & krolik 2000b ) .",
    "whether the viscous instability acts under these conditions depends on the character of dynamical coupling ( see , e.g. , agol & krolik 1998 ) between the radiation and the mhd turbulence that most likely accounts for angular momentum transport in disks ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "we have also shown that radiation sound waves may be driven unstable if the emission of radiation is proportional to either the gas density or the local radiation pressure ( the latter possibility is suggested by a straight - forward extrapolation of the ",
    "@xmath55-model ) .",
    "although phenomenological guesses of this variety are plausible , we do not yet know enough about the physical mechanisms of dissipation in accretion disks to say whether this is what should actually happen .",
    "however , if it does occur , growth of radiation sound waves ( and , presumably , magnetosonic waves ) could provide an additional source of turbulence in disks , supplementing magneto - rotational instability and convection . indeed ,",
    "if dissipation leads to renewed stirring , there might be interesting twists to the character of the mhd turbulent cascade ."
