    "the angle @xmath5 of the unitarity triangle has been determined to @xmath6 @xcite from time - dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath7 transitions .",
    "if sub - leading decay amplitudes can be neglected as argued in @xcite , time - dependent cp asymmetries in penguin - dominated @xmath0 transitions should also take the value @xmath8 .",
    "there now exist various measurements @xcite , which _ on average _ point to the significantly smaller value @xmath9 .",
    "it is not inconceivable that flavour - specific new flavour - violating interactions cause anomalous effects in @xmath10 transitions without resulting in inconsistencies with other measurements .",
    "this would be a rather spectacular resolution of the apparent discrepancy .",
    "but before this conclusion can be drawn , a thorough study of the sub - leading decay amplitudes is necessary to ascertain the standard model expectation .",
    "this is undertaken here in the framework of qcd factorization @xcite .",
    "the analysis is based on the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) factorization calculations performed in @xcite , where numerical values of the time - dependent cp asymmetries for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 final states have already been given . in this letter",
    "i include a larger set of final states ( see also the recent work @xcite ) , and consider a more detailed error estimation that includes a scan of the theoretical parameter space @xcite .",
    "i also discuss constraints on the sub - leading decay amplitudes that do not rely on factorization but are inspired by it .",
    "another method to constrain the differences of time - dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath7 and @xmath13 transitions based on systematic approximations to the strong interactions relies on the assumption of su(3 ) flavour symmetry .",
    "this results in bounds on the magnitude of this difference , but the sign can not be determined @xcite .",
    "an estimate in a model of ( long - distance ? ) final state interactions is given in @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent cp asymmetry in decays to cp eigenstates is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 the @xmath16 mass difference .",
    "the @xmath17 decay amplitude involves two weak couplings @xmath18 and two strong interaction amplitudes @xmath19 .",
    "i write @xmath20 where @xmath21 a standard calculation now gives @xmath22 @xmath23 here @xmath24 denotes the cp eigenvalue of @xmath25 .",
    "( all final states discussed below have @xmath26 . )",
    "the quantity @xmath27 is the central object of this letter .",
    "one notes that ( a ) @xmath28 is suppressed by a small ratio of ckm elements , @xmath29 , leading to the expectation that @xmath30 ( see above ) ; ( b ) if @xmath28 is small as expected , then to first order in @xmath28 the two asymmetries @xmath31 and @xmath32 involve _ independent _ hadronic parameters , namely the dispersive and absorptive part of @xmath33 .",
    "the hadronic amplitudes @xmath19 , @xmath34 are sums of `` topological '' amplitudes , referring to tree ( @xmath35 ) , qcd penguin ( @xmath36 ) , singlet penguin ( @xmath37 ) , electroweak penguin ( @xmath38 ) and annihilation contributions . the relation to the `` flavour '' amplitudes used in qcd factorization @xcite is @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 with the difference that the @xmath44 exclude form factors , decay constants and the ckm factors , while the topological amplitudes exclude only the ckm factor .",
    "in addition , a penguin amplitude such as @xmath45 may be a sum of several @xmath46 terms depending on the flavour flow to the final state .",
    "the expressions for all relevant decay amplitudes in terms of flavour amplitudes are collected in appendix  a of  @xcite .",
    "schematically , for the strangeness - changing decays @xmath47 , the hadronic amplitude ratio is given by @xmath48 where the dominant amplitudes have been indicated .",
    "note that the amplitudes @xmath49 depend on the final state @xmath25 .    in the qcd factorization framework",

    "the underbraces indicate the order in perturbation theory to which the various short - distance kernels are computed at nlo .",
    "the numerical implementation of ( [ factform ] ) also includes some @xmath53 power corrections from scalar penguin operators , and from an estimate of annihilation topologies .",
    "the accuracy of the treatment is generically limited by @xmath54 at the amplitude level .",
    "the actual uncertainties affect different observables to a different degree and must be estimated on a case - by - case basis .",
    "the `` colour - allowed '' amplitudes @xmath55 are rather certain , while the `` colour - suppressed '' amplitudes @xmath56 receive contributions from spectator scattering ( the second line of ( [ factform ] ) ) enhanced by large wilson coefficients , and are inflicted by larger uncertainties .",
    "the qcd penguin amplitudes include uncertain annihilation contributions , although the ratio @xmath57 is less affected .",
    "finally , the singlet amplitude @xmath37 involves several specific decay mechanisms @xcite , which are difficult to compute quantitatively , though none of them seems to be of particular importance for the cp asymmetries .",
    "( [ schematic ] ) indicates that @xmath27 involves some of the less certain amplitudes .",
    "the numerical analysis below takes into account all flavour amplitudes following @xcite , but it suffices to focus on a few dominant terms to understand the qualitative features of the result .",
    "then , for the various final states , the relevant hadronic amplitude ratio is given by @xmath58+[c]}{[-p^c ] } } &   \\phantom{sp}\\phantom{spa } & \\rho^0 k_s   \\phantom{spa } &   \\hat d_f\\sim { \\displaystyle \\frac{[p^u]-[c]}{[p^c ] } } \\\\[0.6 cm ] \\eta^\\prime k_s &   \\hat d_f\\sim { \\displaystyle \\frac{[-p^u]-[c]}{[-p^c ] } } &   \\phantom{sp } & \\phi k_s &   \\hat d_f\\sim { \\displaystyle \\frac{[-p^u]}{[-p^c ] } }   \\\\[0.6 cm ] \\eta k_s &   \\hat d_f\\sim { \\displaystyle \\frac{[p^u]+[c]}{[p^c ] } } &   \\phantom{sp } & \\omega k_s &   \\hat d_f\\sim { \\displaystyle \\frac{[p^u]+[c]}{[p^c ] } }   \\end{array}\\ ] ] the convention here is that quantities in square brackets have positive real part .",
    "( recall from ( [ dss ] ) that @xmath27 mainly requires the real part of @xmath59 . ) in factorization @xmath60 $ ] is near unity , roughly independent of the particular final state , hence @xmath27 receives a nearly universal , small and _ positive _ contribution of about @xmath61 . on the contrary the magnitudes and signs of the penguin amplitudes real parts",
    "can be very different .",
    "ignoring uncertainties , i find @xmath62|$ ] in the proportions @xmath63 hence the influence of the colour - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath64 determines the difference in @xmath27 between the different modes .",
    "for @xmath65 the effect of @xmath64 is constructive , but for @xmath66 it is destructive .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath67 $ ] is much larger for @xmath68 than for @xmath69 , hence @xmath70 remains small and positive for the former final state , but becomes negative for the latter .",

    "( [ second ] ) implies that even when an enhancement of the amplitudes @xmath72 by a factor of several to order @xmath73 is allowed , they do not appear in the ratio of cp - averaged branching fractions at first order in @xmath73 .",
    "thus , with an accuracy of a few percent , @xmath74 hence @xmath75 can be determined from data , if @xmath76 is sufficiently different from 1 ( to justify the neglect of the order @xmath77 terms ) , but @xmath78 .",
    "the colour - allowed tree amplitude @xmath79 is believed to be well - predicted in factorization , and has a small absorptive part . assuming this , an accurate measurement of @xmath76 for @xmath80 provides an estimate of @xmath81 , of which the sign should be reliable . making the same assumption for @xmath64",
    "constrains the contribution from @xmath82 to @xmath27 , but in this case the assumption is already questionable .",
    "the contribution from @xmath83 is not constrained as long as it is of order @xmath73 .",
    "however , one may argue that _ if _ @xmath83 is enhanced to order @xmath73 by whatever mechanism , then  _ probably _  the absorptive part @xmath84 , and hence the direct cp asymmetry , will also be of order @xmath73 .",
    "similar arguments can be applied to the @xmath85 and @xmath86 system ( [ first ] ) . to linear order in @xmath73 , @xmath87",
    "the electroweak penguin amplitudes are now important .",
    "for @xmath86 the corresponding prefactor reduces the branching fraction ratio by a factor of three .",
    "in fact , the contribution is so large that the linear approximation becomes inapplicable to the @xmath86 final state . for @xmath85 , the complete set of three branching fraction ratios",
    "can be used in principle to determine the real parts of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 simultaneously with a relative uncertainty of order @xmath73 in the linear approximation .",
    "however , the current experimental @xmath85 data does not lead to useful results .",
    "i conclude from this discussion that it is very difficult to constrain @xmath27 independent of theoretical assumptions using only experimental data ( other than the measurement of @xmath27 itself ) . with some plausible dynamical assumptions bounds",
    "can be derived using su(3 ) , or the real parts and signs of amplitudes related to the quantities of interest can be determined and compared to the factorization calculations , thus providing cross - checks .",
    "qcd factorization calculations of the time - dependent cp asymmetry in hadronic @xmath10 transitions yield only small corrections to the expectation @xmath91 . with the exception of the @xmath92 final state",
    "the correction @xmath27 is positive , slightly strengthening the discrepancy with the current average experimental data .",
    "the effect and theoretical uncertainty is particularly small for the two final states @xmath11 and @xmath12 already analyzed in @xcite ; the calculation of @xmath27 for the final states @xmath92 and @xmath93 , however , is more susceptible to errors because of amplitude cancellations .",
    "the final - state dependence of @xmath27 is ascribed to the colour - suppressed tree amplitude .",
    "it appears difficult to constrain @xmath27 theory - independently by other observables . in particular ,",
    "the direct cp asymmetries or the charged decays corresponding to @xmath94 probe hadronic quantities other than those relevant to @xmath27 , if these observables take values in the expected range .",
    "large deviations from expectations such as large direct cp asymmetries would clearly indicate a defect in our understanding of hadronic physics , but even then the quantitative implications for @xmath31 would be unclear .",
    "a hadronic interpretation of large @xmath27 would probably involve an unknown long - distance effect that discriminates strongly between the up- and charm - penguin amplitude resulting in an enhancement of the up - penguin amplitude .",
    "no model is known to me that could plausibly produce such an effect .",
