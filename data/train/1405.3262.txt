    "the origin of cosmic rays  ( crs ) , in particular above the knee energy @xmath4 and at ultra - high energies  ( uhes ; @xmath5 ) , is still uncertain , but the discovery of sub - pev neutrinos by icecube  @xcite may provide clues to this origin . given that the distribution of the arrival directions is consistent with isotropy , most events are likely to come from extragalactic pev accelerators  ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , although a fraction of them may be attributed to galactic sources  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "importantly , the above injection rate is comparable to that required for the uhecr sources @xmath10 , or equivalently , the observed flux of the inb is consistent with the waxman - bahcall limit  @xcite with @xmath11 .",
    "this may indicate that uhecrs also originate in the same type of sources  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note , however , that if indeed the parent cr spectrum of the inb is as hard as @xmath1 and the maximum energy is in the uhe range , @xmath9 may have to become low at @xmath12 in order for the by - product neutrinos to be consistent with the non - detection of super - pev neutrinos by icecube  @xcite .    in summary",
    ", a significant fraction of the inb , the igb , and possibly also the uhecrs , can be consistently attributed to a single type of source based on a @xmath6 scenario if    * the sources have the right local cr injection rate of @xmath13 , * the sources accelerate crs up to uhes with a hard spectral index of @xmath7 , and * the crs with @xmath14 lose a fraction of their energy via hadronuclear reactions , i.e. , @xmath15 ,    ( hereafter , we use @xmath16 ) .",
    "individual local source identifications using e.g. , hawc  @xcite and cta  @xcite are the keys to testing the scenarios . here , we investigate galaxy merger shocks  ( gmss ) as such a possibility . in the concordance cosmology , a good fraction of the massive galaxies experience a major merger and several minor mergers in a cosmological timescale . during the direct encounters between two galaxies ,",
    "their cold - gas components are shocked with sufficiently large mach numbers to enable an efficient cr acceleration .",
    "below , we show that gmss can meet the conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) , and the anticipated cr injection rate can be a good fraction of that required by condition ( i ) for a cr acceleration efficiency of @xmath17 .",
    "first , let us estimate the intrinsic energy budget of a galaxy merger .",
    "hereafter , we mainly consider major mergers between massive galaxies with a stellar mass of @xmath18 , which likely dominate the total energy budget .",
    "the energy dissipated by a gms can be estimated as @xmath19 , or @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the shocked gas mass and @xmath22 is the shock velocity . at least up to @xmath23 , the galaxy gas mass is typically @xmath2 of the stellar mass at the high - mass end with @xmath24  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the shock velocity is essentially the relative velocity between the merging galaxies , which can range up from @xmath25 at a pericenter distance of @xmath26 in the point particle approximation .",
    "the shock dissipation occurs with a dynamical timescale , @xmath27 and the energy dissipation rate per merger is @xmath28    the local major merger rate of massive galaxies has been estimated as @xmath29  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "equivalently , an @xmath30 of massive galaxies experience major mergers in a cosmological time given that the mean density is @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the possible cr injection rate by gmss can be estimated as @xmath32 , or @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the cr acceleration efficiency .",
    "next , we consider the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanism  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at gmss . for this ,",
    "we consider first the characteristics of gms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . the mach number of gmss can be estimated as @xmath35 , which is much larger than unity for the cold gas component with @xmath36 . here",
    ", we use @xmath37 for ionized gas ( see below ) . on the other hand , the temperature downstream of the shock can be estimated as @xmath38 .",
    "such a high downstream temperature plays an important role in characterizing gmss , first of all because the radiative cooling becomes relevant in this region . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the main cooling channel is provided by metal line emissions and free - free emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using an approximate form of the cooling function for a solar metallicity interstellar medium  ( ism ) , the cooling timescale can be estimated as @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the preshock gas density . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : t_dyn ] ) and ( [ eq : t_rad ] ) , one can see that for a shock velocity @xmath42 , the downstream plasma cools within a dynamical timescale , i.e. , the gms shocks are radiative . in this case , a larger compression ratio than the @xmath43 ratio of strong adiabatic shocks is realized beyond the radiative region , which is @xmath44 from the shock surface .",
    "such highly compressed regions are plausible sites for violent star formation during the galaxy merger  @xcite .",
    "second , the uv photons from the radiative zone can significantly ionize the upstream ism .",
    "@xcite showed that this occurs for shock velocities @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", one can naturally expect alfv@xmath46n - wave turbulence behind the gms , which is crucial for the dsa mechanism .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields in interacting galaxies are observed to be @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "one can also expect an amplification of the magnetic fields at least locally around the shocks as @xmath48 , or @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the amplification factor .    in the dsa mechanism , the resultant cr spectral index , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , is characterized by the compression ratio as @xmath53 in the test - particle approximation .",
    "as discussed above , the compression ratio can be much larger than unity , @xmath54 , comparing the upstream and the far downstream beyond the radiative zone .",
    "on the other hand , the size of the acceleration region in the downstream can be estimated as @xmath55 here , @xmath56 is the diffusion coefficient in the bohm limit , @xmath57 is the larmor radius , and @xmath58 is the electric charge of the crs . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : l_rad ] ) and ( [ eq : l_acc ] ) , the crs in the gms acceleration reside in the region where @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and thus , the cr spectral index can be @xmath1 .    the maximum energy possible for crs is given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the acceleration timescale .",
    "this gives @xmath63 , or @xmath64 here , @xmath65 depends on the effective compression ratio and the magnetic field configuration , etc . for an @xmath66 parallel shock in the bohm limit , @xmath67 .",
    "thus , one can expect @xmath68 for proton crs ( @xmath69 ) at gmss .",
    "if highly efficient magnetic - field amplification , @xmath70 , is the case at gmss , the maximum energy could be further boosted up to uhes for , e.g. , iron crs ( @xmath71 ) , which may be consistent with the possible transition in the auger uhecr composition reported by @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that such uhecr fluxes can be suppressed by dissociation of the nucleus during the acceleration  @xcite .",
    "also , even proton crs can be accelerated up to uhes with larger gms velocities as possible in galaxy collisions , @xmath72 , where the shocks are adiabatic . however , the size of the acceleration region of proton crs with @xmath73 can be larger than the width of the merging galaxy @xmath74 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : l_acc ] ) .",
    "then , a fraction of such crs escape from the acceleration region , which also suppresses the uhecr flux .",
    "next , let us discuss the energy loss of the crs , which we have so far neglected , focusing on proton crs in this section .",
    "when a gms completes sweeping the galaxies , the high - pressure radiative region begins to cool down almost adiabatically , and so do the crs trapped in this region .",
    "this occurs on a dynamical timescale , @xmath75 ( eq.([eq : t_dyn ] ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy loss timescale due to @xmath6 interactions can be estimated as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 , and the cross section evolves only logarithmically with cr energy .",
    "the effective hadronuclear optical depth can be estimated as @xmath80 , or @xmath81 thus , crs predominately lose their energy via @xmath6 interactions .",
    "note that other energy loss processes , such as synchrotron , are irrelevant at least up to @xmath82 .    in @xmath6 interactions ,",
    "the charged and neutral pions are produced with a ratio of @xmath83 .",
    "the charged pions finally decay into three neutrinos and one positron with roughly the same energy , and the neutral pions decay into two gamma rays .",
    "the flavor is totally mixed via neutrino oscillation for extragalactic sources .",
    "the spectral index of both the neutrinos and gamma rays is approximately the same as that of the parent protons , i.e. , @xmath84 in our case .",
    "the high energy cutoff is @xmath85 for neutrinos , and twice larger for gamma rays , although gamma rays above @xmath86 from @xmath87 are attenuated by the extragalactic background light .",
    "first , let us estimate the neutrino flux per flavor from a local gms , that is , @xmath88 ( \\xi_{cr}l_{gms}/{\\cal c } ) ( 1/4 \\pi d_l{}^2)$ ] , or @xmath89 here , @xmath90 is the luminosity distance to the source , and @xmath91 ( or @xmath92 for @xmath93 ) is the bolometric collection factor .",
    "we take @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the estimate . with the above parameter",
    "set , one can only expect a small muon event rate , @xmath96 , using icecube .",
    "thus , individual local gms source identifications through high - energy neutrinos will be difficult in the coming years .",
    "on the other hand , the gamma - ray flux from a local gms can be estimated as @xmath97 , or @xmath98 detecting such a flux is marginally difficult for _ fermi _ and current air cherenkov telescopes , but can be detectable by cta up to @xmath99 with a sufficiently long observation time .",
    "candidate sources are discussed in the next section .",
    "finally , let us estimate the diffuse flux from cosmological gmss .",
    "generally , the inb flux can be estimated as  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "note that the observed local value , @xmath109 still has a factor of a few uncertainty , and the merger rate can evolve with redshift as @xmath110 with @xmath111  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such uncertainties in galaxy evolution can be absorbed in the @xmath112 factor .",
    "a possible pev cutoff is consistent with the conservative estimate of the maximum cr energy , but the maximum neutrino energy can be larger if the uhecr acceleration is typically the case at gmss .",
    "our arguments regarding the cr acceleration and the @xmath6 energy loss can be also applied to gmss in minor mergers .",
    "although the energy dissipation in a minor merger is a factor of a few smaller , the event rate is a factor of a few larger than that of a major merger . given this ( or a higher cr acceleration efficiency , @xmath113 ) ,",
    "the observed inb could be totally attributed to cosmological gmss .",
    "the igb flux can again be tightly connected to the inb flux as @xmath114 . following the same reasoning as in @xcite , we see here that a fraction @xmath30 of the observed igb at @xmath115 can be attributed to gmss , for a slope of @xmath84",
    ".     corresponds to a case with @xmath70 and @xmath116 ( see eq .",

    "the solid and dashed lines represent the inb and the atmospheric background flux observed by icecube , respectively.,width=340 ]",
    "as we showed above , given the concordance cosmology and a cr acceleration efficiency of @xmath117 , gmss can provide at least @xmath3 of the observed inb .",
    "this scenario can be indirectly tested by detecting gamma rays from the local merging galaxies using cta . within the cta detection horizon , @xmath99",
    ", one can expect @xmath118 such systems .",
    "two of the interesting candidates are the  taffy \" colliding galaxy pairs ugc 12914/5 and ugc 813/6  @xcite , located at @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively . in both cases , gas components of @xmath121 collided with a velocity of @xmath122 a few @xmath123 ago .",
    "the bridge region between the galaxy pairs filled with shocked gases , and shows strong synchrotron emission which may come from non - thermal electrons accelerated by the gms  @xcite .",
    "another interesting candidate is vv 114  @xcite , which is a gas - rich merging galaxy pair with a core separation of @xmath124 , located at @xmath125 from the earth   @xcite .",
    "the galaxy interaction may have already triggered the starburst and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity in this system  @xcite .",
    "if the acceleration in gmss is efficient , we can again expect @xmath126 local sources within the gzk radius @xmath127 , which might form hotspots in the uhecr sky   is not likely in our scenario .",
    "here we use the gzk radius as a benchmark distance . ] .",
    "the number density of gmss is smaller than the estimated number of sources required inside the gzk radius @xmath128  @xcite , but the flux from the merging galaxies could be @xmath17 of the observed one .",
    "such uhecrs from local gmss can arrive at the earth on overlapping time windows with neutrinos and gamma rays for an intergalactic field of @xmath129  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we should note that the gms scenario is competitive with , but not easy to separate from , other scenarios .",
