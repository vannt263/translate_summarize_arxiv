    "quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for many quantum information processing tasks , e.g. super - dense coding , quantum cryptography and quantum error correction [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "entangled states can be used in constructing number of protocols , e.g. teleportation [ 5 ] , key distribution and quantum computation [ 6 ] . during recent past ,",
    "entanglement sudden death ( esd ) has been investigated by different authors for bipartite and multipartite states [ 7 - 10 ] .",
    "yu and eberly [ 11 , 12 ] have shown that entanglement loss occurs in a finite time under the action of pure vacuum noise in a bipartite qubit system .",
    "a geometric interpretation of the phenomenon of esd has been given in ref .",
    "furthermore , experimental evidences of esd have been reported for optical setups [ 14 , 15 ] and atomic ensembles [ 16 ] .",
    "peres - horodecki [ 17 , 18 ] have studied entanglement of qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit states and established separability criterion . according to this criterion , the partial transpose of a separable density matrix must have non - negative eigenvalues . for non - separable states ,",
    "the sum of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose matrix gives the degree of entanglement of a density matrix also termed as negativity .",
    "ann et al .",
    "[ 19 ] have studied a qubit - qutrit system where they have shown the existence of esd under the influence of dephasing noise .",
    "bipartite entangled states are divided into free - entangled states and bound - entangled states [ 20 , 21 ] .",
    "free - entangled states can be distilled under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) whereas bound - entangled states can not be distilled to pure - state entanglement irrespective of the number of copies of the initial state available .",
    "wang et al . proposed that free - entangled states may be converted into bound - entangled states under multi - local [ 22 ] and collective dephasing processes [ 23 ] .",
    "they have shown that certain free - entangled states of qutrit - qutrit systems become non - distillable in a finite time under the influence of classical noise . for a qutrit - qutrit system",
    "there are many bound entangled states and no single criterion can fully describe all of them [ 24 ] .",
    "however , the realignment criterion can be used to detect certain bound entangled states [ 25 ] .    since , it is  not possible to completely isolate a quantum system from its environment .",
    "therefore , one needs to investigate the behavior of entanglement in the presence of environmental effects .",
    "a major problem of quantum communication is to faithfully transmit unknown quantum states through a noisy quantum channel .",
    "when quantum information is sent through a channel , the carriers of the information interact with the channel and get entangled with its many degrees of freedom . in order to quantify entanglement ,",
    "two measures are the negativity [ 26 ] , a measure of a state having negative partial transpose and the realignment criterion [ 25 ] .",
    "the negativity is equal to the absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues of partial transpose of a state .",
    "when the negativity becomes zero , we need to study the time evolution of realignment criterion to determine the existence of bound - entangled states .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that realignment criterion could not detect all entangled states .    in this paper ,",
    "the effect of flipping noise on the entanglement dynamics of a qutrit - qutrit system under the influence of global , local and multilocal decoherence is investigated by considering phase flip , trit flip and trit phase flip channels .",
    "it is shown that the entanglement sudden death can be avoided in the presence of phase flip , trit flip and trit phase flip environments .",
    "it is also shown that particular local operations can not avoid the non - distillability of the distillable states .",
    "further more , no esd and dsd is seen for trit flip channel in the presence of global noise .",
    "let us consider that the initial state is interacting with the noisy environment both collectively and individually .",
    "local and multi - local couplings describe the situation when both the qutrits are independently influenced by their individual noisy environments . whereas , the global decoherence corresponds to the situation when it is influenced by both local and multilocal noises at the same time .",
    "the state shared by the two parties is an entangled qutrit - qutrit state of the form@xmath0where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is a maximally entangled bipartite qutrit state and @xmath3 are separable states given as @xmath4 , @xmath5    the above density matrix is separable for @xmath6 , bound entangled for @xmath7 and free entangled for @xmath8 [ 27 ] .",
    "the interaction between the system and its environment introduces the decoherence to the system , which is a process of the undesired correlation between the system and the environment .",
    "the dynamics of the composite system in the presence of flipping noise can be described in kraus operators formalism [ 29 ]    @xmath9    where the kraus operators @xmath10 satisfy the following completeness relation    @xmath11    the single qutrit kraus operators for phase flip channel can be written as    @xmath12    and the single qutrit kraus operators for the trit flip channel are given as    @xmath13    whereas , the single qutrit kraus operators for the trit phase flip channel are given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 represents the quantum noise parameter usually termed as decoherence parameter . here",
    "the bounds [ 0 , 1 ] of @xmath16 correspond to @xmath17 , @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the evolution of the initial density matrix of the composite system when it is influenced by local and multi - local environments is given in kraus operator form as @xmath19and the evolution of the system when it is influenced by global environment is given in kraus operator representation as @xmath20where @xmath21 @xmath22 are the kraus operators of the multilocal couplings of the individual qutrits and @xmath23 are the kraus operators of the collective coupling of the qutrit system . using equations ( 2 - 5 ) along with the initial density matrix of as given in equation ( 1 ) and taking the partial transpose over the second qutrit , the eigenvalues of the final density matrix can be easily found .",
    "let the decoherence parameters for local and global noise be @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath16 respectively .",
