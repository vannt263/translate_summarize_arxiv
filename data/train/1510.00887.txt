    "the study of physics of the black holes takes an important place in the theory of quantum gravity .",

    "that enables us to come to a significant conclusion related to the early stages of the creation of the universe by studying the characteristics of these objects . in both cases , the dynamics of the matter and space - time at the planck scale demands quantum approach . in the absence of a complete theory of quantum gravity , it is important to analyse particular classical cosmological models and their quantum versions within the approach that is using canonical quantization or path integral quantization",
    ". both of these approaches demand the determination of the wave function ( of the universe ) for a quantum cosmological model . by doing so in the first case ( canonical qantization ) the wave function",
    "is acquired through solving wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite , in the second case ( path integral quantization ) it can be done by feynman minisuperspace propagator with appropriate boundary condition ( the best known are the hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal @xcite and the vilenkin tunneling proposal @xcite ) .    this paper presents the schwarzschild black hole interior as a homogeneous and anisotropic kantowski - sachs minisuperspace cosmological model without a matter field and the cosmological constant.this approach is based on a diffeomorphism between the schwarzschild solution of the einstein field equation and the corresponding solution of this cosmological model .",

    "the prediction , of the space - time discreetness structure around planck distances ( @xmath2 cm ) , is common to both of these approaches ( @xmath0-adic and noncommutative ) . in @xmath0-adic case",
    "this discreetness is implicitly present , in noncommutative case it is explicitly present through commutation relations of noncommutative coordinates and/or their conjugate momenta .",
    "noncommutative coordinates are used for the first time by wigner and snyder .",
    "this idea , used by connes and woronowicz in noncommutative geometry , enabled the development of the new formulation of quantum gravity through noncommutative differential calculus .    after determination and decoupling of langrangian for the classical anisotropic kantowski - sachs model of the schwarzschild black hole interior , for @xmath0-adic form of the model",
    ", we will determine the propagator and the conditions of the vacuum states existence .",
    "in the noncommutative case , classical action for the two types of the euler - lagrange equation solutions , will be determined from noncommutative lagrangian .",
    "after that , we will write wheeler - dewitt equation and determine its general solution i.e. the wave function which corresponds to the interior of a non - rotating and non - charged ( schwarzschild ) black hole , according to hamiltonian formalism for the quantum form of the model in commutative case . then",

    "this other singularity is  apparent  or coordinate singularity and can be removed by a suitable coordinate transformation ( for example kruskal - szekeres transformation ) .    on the other hand",

    "this suggests that space and time change roles in a way , once the event horizon is passed .",
    "namely , the time coordinate , for an observer outside the event horizon , becomes spatial - like for another observer inside the schwarzschild sphere . in this sense , for both observers , there is one possible direction of movement , for an outside observer in time and for an inside observer in space ( right to singularity ) . in regard to what was previously said",

    "especially , for the @xmath0-adic model , the conditions for existence of the vacuum @xmath0-adic states are determined . in the noncommutative case",
    "classical actions for two types of solutions for euler - lagrange equations are calculated .",
    "then , within standard commutative cosmology , wheeler - dewitt equation of the model is written and its solution , i.e. the wave function of the model , is determined and by means of that , quantum dynamics of the interior of the schwarzschild black hole is described . within the adelic approach ,",
    "the adelic wave function is written as a product of real and @xmath0-adic wave functions of the model .",
    "finally , in the part which is related to the schwarzschild black hole thermodynamics , by applying the feynman - hibbs procedure , hawking temperature is determined as well as entropy with corresponding quantum corrections .",
    "the important question for of this further research is the question of the classical limit i.e. prediction of classical state of the model from its wave function . in that sense",
    "it is of the great interest to consider classical - quantum correspondence through classical trajectory in configuration space of variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( which we obtain from ( 19 ) by eliminating @xmath196 ) and maximum of square modulus of the wave function from ( 54 ) .",
