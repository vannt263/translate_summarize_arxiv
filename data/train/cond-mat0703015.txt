    "much effort has been devoted to understanding the effects of competing interactions on quasi - one - dimensional systems .",
    "recent advances in loading ultracold bosonic atoms into an optical lattice lead to the realization of one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice boson systems , and inspire the investigation on many - body quantum phenomena therein .",
    "@xcite besides the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath0 and the tunable on - site interaction @xmath1 , a sizable nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 is now within experimental reach by using the dipolar interaction among atoms .",
    "@xcite these experiments raise the interest in creating and detecting exotic quantum phases in 1d interacting lattice boson systems .    for 1d lattice bosons at integer filling , the phase diagram obtained by the mean - field calculation includes three different phases .",
    "they are the mott insulator ( mi ) for large @xmath1 , a charge density wave ( cdw ) for large @xmath2 , and a superfluid ( sf ) for large @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite however , by using the density matrix renormalization group method , it is found recently that , at filling of @xmath3 , there exists a novel insulating phase lying between the cdw and mi phases in the weak coupling region .",
    "@xcite the phase transition between this new phase and the conventional insulating phases ( i.e. , the cdw and mi phases ) is found to be of second order .",
    "similar to the haldane phase of quantum spin - one chains ,  @xcite this new insulating phase can be identified by a highly nonlocal string order parameter , and thus called as the haldane insulator ( hi ) phase .",
    "@xcite another investigation employing quantum monte carlo simulations shows that , when @xmath4 , there exists a supersolid ( ss ) phase lying between the @xmath3 cdw and the @xmath5 cdw phases .",
    "@xcite the cdw - ss transition is found to be of second order with dynamic critical exponent @xmath6 .",
    "recently , due to the possibility of a fault tolerant quantum computation based on non - abelian anyons ,  @xcite people begin to search for models containing non - abelian anyons ,  @xcite as well as for techniques for their detection and manipulation .",
    "@xcite it is pointed out that bosonic atoms in a 1d lattice with infinite repulsive three - body on - site interactions around @xmath3 have a ground state very close to a gapless pfaffian - like state ,  @xcite which may serve as the basis to create non - abelian anyons in 1d systems .    with an eye on these new developments , it is desirable to have a unified understanding to the rich phases and the quantum phase transitions among them through a suitable low - energy effective theory . a common way of deriving low - energy effective theory for 1d bosonic systems is to use haldane s density - phase representation ( also known as  phenomenological bosonization \" ) .",
    "@xcite such an approach has been successfully used to address the low - energy physics of sf and the related mott transitions at commensurate fillings .",
    "@xcite however , this effective theory contains _ only one _ set of collective variables which describe long - wavelength phase and density fluctuations , and can show only one phase transition between two phases .",
    "that is , it fails to show two phase transitions found in ref .  .",
    "moreover , in this simplest one - component hydrodynamic effective action , the cdw and the sf order parameters compete ( or , are dual to ) each other .",
    "therefore , from such an effective theory , it is hard to understand the origin of the ss phase reported in ref .  , where the cdw and the sf orders coexist .",
    "in the present work , a low - energy effective theory with _ two _ sets of bosonic phase fields is proposed . within the present framework ,",
    "not only the nature of the phase transitions and the corresponding critical modes can be explicitly identified , the phase diagrams reported in refs .   and can also be easily understood .",
    "moreover , we find that the ss phase in 1d has at most an _ algebraic _ long - range cdw order and has an algebraic _ boson - paired superfluid _ order instead of the ordinary one .",
    "furthermore , the general condition for the appearance of the gapless pfaffian - like state can be realized within the present approach .",
    "this observation will be of help for searching gapless pfaffian - like state in more realistic systems .",
    "we believe that the effective theory shown below provides a general description of the low - energy physics for 1d interacting lattice bosons near integer filling , and it serves as a starting point for further investigations on the static and dynamical properties of these systems .",
    "the lattice bosons with a nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath0 , an on - site interaction @xmath1 , and a nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 can be described by the extended bose - hubbard model ( ebhm ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the bosonic creation operator at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the number operator , and @xmath11 measures deviations of the particle number from a mean filling @xmath12 . since our main concern is in discussing the phase transition among various insulating phases , where the local particle number fluctuations should not be strong , near an integer filling @xmath13 ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) , one can truncate the bosonic fock space to only three local states with particle numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "the bosonized forms of the original lattice boson operators are @xmath29 with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the lattice constant and plays the role of a short - distance cutoff . in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ bosonform ] ) , some irrelevant ( or less relevant ) terms have been dropped . as a result , the charge and",

    "we note that , while the method of phenomenological bosonization can give identical form of the charge part in eq .",
    "( [ bosonform ] ) ,  @xcite the neutral mode is missed in that approach . that is the reason why the conventional theory fails to account for the complete phase diagram of the interacting lattice bosons near the integer fillings . as shown in refs .   and , assuming the couplings in the two coupled spin-1/2 chains being weak , the values of the parameters in eq .",

    "since the present effective hamiltonian is reached under several approximations , the values of the above parameters should not be treated very seriously . here",
    "we would like to consider eq .",
    "( [ bosonform ] ) as a phenomenological theory .",
    "it provides a universal low - energy physics of the 1d interacting lattice boson models near integer fillings , such that the nature of the phase transitions and the long - distance behaviors of the major correlation functions at each phase can be predicted .",
    "as shown below , this effective hamiltonian does explain the results reported recently .",
    "@xcite it reinforces our belief in the validity of the present framework .",

    "( [ bosonform ] ) , the phase diagram can be obtained as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , which looks similar to that reported in ref .   in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "according to the work in ref .",
    ", better agreement can be reached if one keeps more local states ( say , with particle numbers @xmath39 , @xmath16 , and @xmath40 ) and maps the interacting lattice boson model to a spin chain with higher integer spin .",
    "@xcite however , we must emphasize that one of the most important feature of the bosonization analysis in ref .",
    "is that the properties of the corresponding spin model do not dramatically depend on the value of the spin quantum number @xmath41 , but only on whether @xmath41 is integer or half - odd integer .",
    "this suggests that the main results obtained below from our analysis of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ bosonform ] ) should remain unchanged even when the local particle number fluctuations become stronger .",
    "the phase boundary separating the sf and the mi phases is determined by @xmath42 .",
    "this comes from the relevance of the @xmath43 term in the charge sector of eq .",
    "( [ bosonform ] ) , and thus gives a type of kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "@xcite the mi - hi phase transition is given by @xmath44 .",
    "it is a gaussian transition , which separates two gapped phases .",
    "the hi - cdw transition occurs when @xmath45 .",
    "it is due to the competition of the two relevant terms ( i.e. , the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 terms ) in the neutral sector of eq .",
    "( [ bosonform ] ) , and thus is a ising - type transition .",
    "@xcite by using the bosonized forms of the original lattice boson operators in eq .",
    "( [ boson - operator ] ) , the correlation functions at long distance can be calculated . in the sf phase , because the charge mode is gapless while the neutral field @xmath48 is pinned , the density fluctuation is gapless and the single - particle correlation function shows an algebraic long range order ( lro ) with an enhanced superfluid correlation : @xmath49 .",
    "true lro can develop when @xmath50 . in the cdw phase ,",
    "both of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are pinned . in this case , while the single - particle correlation functions decay exponentially , the staggered part of the density - density correlation shows lro : @xmath53 .",
    "this justifies the identification of the cdw phase . in the mi and the hi phases ,",
    "both @xmath51 and @xmath48 are pinned , and both the single - particle and density correlation functions decay exponentially at long distance .",
    "both in these two gapped phases , the lattice translation symmetry does not break .",
    "the only difference is that the @xmath51 field is pinned at @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the mi and the hi phases , respectively . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", one can distinct the hi phase from the mi one via a nonlocal string order parameter defined by @xmath56 . within the present bosonization approach",
    ", such a string order parameter can be expressed as @xmath57 ,  @xcite which is completely independent of the neutral mode .",
    "thus it is indeed nonzero in the hi phase with @xmath51 being pinned at @xmath58 , consistent with the findings in ref .  .",
    "@xcite to make the relations between the relevant couplings and the pinned fields in each phase more explicit , we summarize the above discussions in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".the luttinger parameters and the roles of various couplings in different phases at integer fillings .",
    "the values of the fields @xmath59 and @xmath48 indicated in this table are the values at which these fields were pinned in each phase . notice that throughout our discussions , we take the coupling @xmath60 ( following ref .  ) , and it is irrelevant only in the cdw phase above . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    "the solid lines denote the commensurate - incommensurate transition with @xmath6 .",
    ", width=230 ]    up to now , our discussion has focused on systems exactly at integer fillings . the deviation from integer",
    "filling can be studied by turning on a nonzero chemical potential @xmath61 and adding a term @xmath62 in the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bhh ] ) .",
    "( @xmath61 is measured from the middle of the lobe . ) in the bosonized representation , this term takes the form @xmath63 , which affects the charge mode only .",
    "@xcite the @xmath64 term tends to create a finite number of kinks in the @xmath51 configuration , and it will compete with the sine - gordon term @xmath65 which tends to pin down @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath61 is comparable to the magnitude of the charge gap of the insulating phases , such a term will trigger a well - known commensurate - incommensurate transition .",
    "@xcite as long as @xmath66 is not too small such that the breather mass gap is larger than the sine - gordon kink mass gap , the universal features of this transition is well captured by the luther - emergy limit of the charge mode , where the bosonized effective hamiltonian can be further mapped to a free massive dirac fermion theory with a chemical potential term .",
    "@xcite at the tranistion point @xmath67 such that the charge gap closes , the gapless charge mode excitation density obeys the scaling relation @xmath68 , and the dynamic critical exponent of this transition becomes @xmath6 . after the transition , the charge mode is described by a gaussian model with nonzero stiffness , which accounts for the sf behavior in 1d .",
    "therefore , starting from either the mi or the hi phase , nonzero @xmath61 can induce a transition to the sf phase . on the other hand , after the transition from the cdw phase , even though the gapless charge mode shows the sf behavior , the cdw - like behavior can remain , and thus the ss phase is obtained .",
    "it is because the neutral sector is unaffected and the @xmath52 field is still pinned in this case even after the transition . according to this analysis , it is tempted to interpret the ss phase near integer fillings as the descendant of the cdw phase at integer fillings .",
    "thus our effective theory does explain the occurrence of a @xmath6 second - order cdw - ss phase transition found in ref .  .",
    "it is noted that , since the the charge mode is gapless in the ss phase , a power - law behavior in the density - density correlation function @xmath69 is expected .",
    "that is , the ss phase has at most an _ algebraic _ long - range cdw order . because @xmath70 in the ss phase , such a power - law decay may not be examined easily by finite - size numerical calculations .",
    "another interesting feature of the ss phase is that , while the superfluid stiffness is nonzero , the single - particle correlation @xmath71 decays _ exponentially _ due to pinning of the @xmath52 field ( or the @xmath48 field being disorder ) .",
    "however , the boson - pair correlation @xmath72 indeed shows an algebraic long range order . thus the system behaves somewhat like a  boson - paired superfluid \" .",
    "this issue deserves further examinations by other approaches .",
    "the above discussions are summarized by the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "besides the application to the 1d ebhm , a recently proposed gapless pfaffian - like state  @xcite as the ground state of three - body - hard - core bosons in 1d lattice can also be understood within the present framework . due to the infinite three - body on - site repulsion , only three local states with occupation numbers",
    "@xmath73 , 1 , 2 are necessary . similar to the previous discussion , the interacting lattice boson model in ref .",
    "can again be mapped to a spin - one chain in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : spinhamiltonian ] ) with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "that is , the lattice boson model studied in ref .",
    "is just a special case of the lattice spin - one hamiltonian studied in the present paper .",
    "therefore , the proposed gapless pfaffian - like state should correspond to one of the _ gapless _ ground states described by the present continuum effective field theory . when @xmath74 and @xmath76 , ignoring the @xmath22-dependent terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : spinhamiltonian ] ) as we did before , the low - energy effective hamiltonian becomes that in eq .",
    "( [ bosonform ] ) with the luttinger parameters @xmath42 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus it indicates that the gapless pfaffian - like state should be identified as the ground state laying on the sf - mi phase boundary , where the charge sector is gapless and the @xmath48 field is pinned . as a nontrivial crosscheck of this observation",
    ", we show that the correlation functions calculated by the phaffian - like wave function under a completely different approach can indeed be reproduced within the present framework . by using the bosonized forms eq .",
    "( [ boson - operator ] ) of the original lattice boson operators , for the ground state laying on the sf - mi phase boundary , the single - particle and boson - pair correlation functions behave at long distance @xmath78 with @xmath42 .",
    "notice that , on the sf - mi phase boundary , the exponent of the single - particle correlation function is always _ four times larger _ than that of the boson - pair correlation function .",
    "these results agree with those in ref .  .",
    "it supports our observation that the ground state laying on the sf - mi phase boundary is nothing but the pfaffian - like state . since a direct strong three - body interaction among atoms",
    "are rare in nature ,  @xcite the authors in ref .   suggested to use a feschbach - resonant system away from the resonance to generate an effective three - body interaction among atoms , thus realizing this novel state .",
    "according to the present discussion , we find that strong three - body on - site repulsion is not essential for the appearance of the pfaffian - like state . instead , 1d interacting lattice boson models can have a gapless pfaffian - like ground state , as long as they are tuned toward the critical points of the sf - mi phase transition .",
    "thus it is plausible to realize such 1d pfaffian - like states in an ordinary boson hubbard model without borrowing the mechanism of feshbach resonance .",
    "to summarize , a low - energy description , which successfully capture the rich phases of the 1d lattice boson model near integer fillings , is constructed .",
    "we believe that the present effective theory provides general applications to related problems .",
    "for example , parallel approaches can be used to study models of coupled 1d hard - core lattice bosons , where similar effective theories can be constructed .",
    "@xcite when local density fluctuations become stronger , more local states with different particle numbers should be kept . following the above reasoning , an effective theory with more bosonic phase fields",
    "should be reached .",
    "it is interesting to see if more novel phases can be found in this case .",
