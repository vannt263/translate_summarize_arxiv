    "for most problems of practical interest , the schrdinger equation describing the evolution of a quantum system is too complicated to be solved exactly .",
    "numerical simulations are therefore commonly employed for this purpose . however , simulating quantum systems on a classical computer is a hard problem .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space of the system increases exponentially with the size of the system  ( e.g. , the number of particles in the system ) . on a quantum computer , on the other hand , the number of qubits required to simulate the system increases linearly with the size of the system . as a result ,",
    "the simulation of quantum systems is more efficient on a quantum computer  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) than on a classical computer .",
    "in general , quantum systems are never perfectly isolated from their environments , and in some cases they must be treated as open systems . understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems is therefore important for studying various quantum phenomena  @xcite . however , the simulation of open quantum systems on a classical computer is also a hard task .",
    "in addition to the exponential increase in the size of the hilbert space of the open system , one also has to consider the effect of the environment , which adds even more degrees of freedom to the problem .",
    "the hamiltonian for an open quantum system coupled to an environment can be expressed as @xmath0where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the hamiltonians of the open system , the environment and the interaction between the open system and the environment , respectively .",

    "however , one is usually only interested in the evolution of the open system , and not the environment .",
    "it turns out that for environments that have short correlation times  ( i.e. , no memory effects ) and induce slow decoherence in the system , the microscopic details of the environment are not important . for purposes of analyzing the dynamics of the system ,",
    "one only needs to know a quantity called the spectral density of the environment .",
    "the spectral density characterizes the frequency distribution of the noise from the environment on the open system .",
    "it combines the density of the environment modes and the strength of the coupling between the environment modes and the system . for",
    "a small set of discrete modes , the spectral density would consist of a sequence of peaks .",
    "however , the frequencies of the environment modes are usually so dense that the spectral density is a smooth function of frequency  @xcite .    then , the task for the study of the dynamics of open systems can be formulated as follows : given the hamiltonian of the open system , the operators through which the open system interacts with the environment , the spectral density of the environment and the temperature , how can we obtain the dynamics of the open system ? and how can we obtain the evolution of the various physical properties of the open system ?    in the case where the environment has no memory effects  ( also referred to as markovian dynamics ) , the evolution of the system can be obtained by solving the so - called master equation , which in the interaction picture has the form  @xcite    @xmath8\\!+\\!\\gamma_{ij}(\\omega ) \\biggl\\{a_{j}(\\omega ) \\rho_{s}(t)a_{i}^{\\dag } ( \\omega ) \\!-\\!\\frac{1}{2}\\left[a_{i}^{\\dag } ( \\omega ) a_{j}(\\omega ) , \\rho _ { s}(t)\\right]_{+}\\biggr\\}\\biggr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 represents the density matrix of the open system , and @xmath10 is the decomposition of the operator @xmath11 into eigen - projectors of the hamiltonian @xmath1 .",

    "the dynamics of the open system becomes too complicated to be exactly solvable , and sometimes it is even practically impossible to derive the master equation .",
    "one natural possibility for tackling such problems is therefore to use quantum simulation .",
    "there has been some work on the quantum simulation of open systems in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors suggested an approach for simulating the markovian dynamics of an open quantum system on a quantum computer .",
    "they showed that the simulation of the markovian dynamics can be reduced to building generators for a markovian semigroup .",

    "res , we estimate the resource requirements for the algorithm . in sec .",
    "eg , we provide an example for the algorithm .",
    "we close with a conclusion section .",
    "in general , there are three steps in simulating the dynamics of an open system on a quantum computer : first , preparing the initial state  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) of the open system and the environment ; second , implementing the dynamics on the open system and finally reading out the state of the open system .",
    "we will focus on the step of implementing the dynamics of the open system , and briefly describe the other two steps of the algorithm in subsection ii.c since they have been discussed in the literature .      in general , the details related to the environment in eq .",
    "( @xmath7 ) are unknown . however , as mentioned above , one does not need to know all these details in order to obtain the system dynamics .",
    "one therefore has a good amount of freedom in constructing a model hamiltonian for the environment .",
    "one could therefore say that under the born - markov approximation the spectral density is the only piece of information that one needs to know about the environment  ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "as long as the spectral density of the model environment matches that of the real environment , the effect on the system will be the same .    in theoretical studies",
    "it is common to model the environment by a bath of harmonic oscillators . for an open system in such an environment ,",
    "the environment hamiltonian takes the form @xmath20and the interaction hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22  ( @xmath23 ) are the creation  ( annihilation ) operators of the environment modes ; @xmath24 are the frequencies of the environment modes and @xmath25 are the coupling coefficients between the open system and the environment modes ; @xmath26 are operators that act in the state space of the open system and depend on the coupling mechanism between the open system and the environment . for a set of discrete modes , the spectral density is usually written as  @xcite @xmath27where @xmath28 is the mass of the @xmath29-th oscillator .",
    "the @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( @xmath31 ) is not restricted to infinitely - sharp @xmath30-functions , but to @xmath30-function approximants .    for purposes of simulating the dynamics of an open quantum system on a digital quantum computer  ( which is based on two - state qubits ) ,",
    "it is probably more natural to model the environment as a bath of two - level systems or spin-@xmath32 particles .",
    "such models are also sometimes used in theoretical studies  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . for an open system in a spin bath , the environment hamiltonian and the interaction hamiltonian",
    "can be expressed in the form @xmath33and @xmath34respectively , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the pauli operators , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are coefficients that describe the relative size of the transverse coupling and the longitudinal coupling to the open system .",
    "the transverse component induces relaxation , whereas the longitudinal component induces pure dephasing . as will be explained in sec .",
    "ii.d , there is a simple alternative method for simulating pure dephasing .",
    "we therefore take @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the spectral density can then be expressed as  @xcite @xmath41the difference between eq .",
    "( @xmath31 ) and eq .",
    "( @xmath42 ) is mostly a matter of convention .",
    "the environment mode frequencies @xmath24 and the coupling coefficients @xmath25 can be determined as follows : we discretize the frequency spectrum of the environment modes in the full frequency range from @xmath43 to @xmath44 into @xmath45 elements where each element has a width @xmath46 : @xmath47correspondingly , the spectral density of the environment , @xmath48 , is discretized and has the value @xmath49 for the @xmath29-th element , where @xmath24 is the frequency of the @xmath29-th element that represents the @xmath29-th environment mode . for a given @xmath50 , by making the following approximation @xmath51the corresponding coupling coefficient @xmath25 between the @xmath29-th element and the open system can be obtained .",
    "then the model hamiltonian is constructed based on the given information of the global system and will be used in the implementation of the algorithm .",
    "the dynamics of the open system is described by the evolution of the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out the environment degrees of freedom from the density matrix of the global system : @xmath52,\\]]where @xmath9 and @xmath53 are the density matrices of the open system and the global system , respectively .",
    "the density matrix @xmath53 undergoes unitary evolution @xmath54where @xmath55 .\\ ] ]    ideally , the dynamics of the open system can be obtained by coupling the open system to an environment that has a large number of particles , letting it evolve and reading out the state of the open system . in practice , on a digital quantum computer that has a limited number of qubits , it is impossible to represent all the particles of a typical environment .",
    "therefore we have to use an alternative technique to simulate the dynamics of the open system in a large environment .",
    "the large size of the environment plays a crucial role in justifying the markovian approximation . under this approximation ,",
    "the typical time during which the internal correlations of the environment related to the effects of the open system exist , @xmath56 , is much shorter than the characteristic relaxation time of the open system , @xmath57 ; as a result , the influence of the open system on the environment is small and can be ignored .",
    "therefore , the state of the global system at any time @xmath58 can be approximately described by the tensor product  @xcite @xmath59where @xmath60 is the thermal equilibrium state of the environment and can be written as @xmath61with @xmath62and @xmath63  ( @xmath64 ) are the eigenvectors  ( eigenvalues ) of the environment hamiltonian @xmath2 , @xmath65 is the partition function @xmath66where @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath69 is the temperature .",
    "note that in the absence of interactions between the environment qubits , the eigenstates @xmath63 can be written as a tensor product of the states of the environment qubits @xmath70as a result , the thermal - equilibrium state of the environment is a tensor product of the thermal - equilibrium states of the individual qubits:@xmath71where @xmath72denotes the thermal equilibrium state of the @xmath29-th environment qubit and@xmath73    an alternative method that can be used to obtain the markovian approximation for a relatively small environment is to frequently force it back into its thermal - equilibrium state .",
    "this process can be implemented relatively easily on a quantum computer , where one has full access to all the qubits .",
    "the procedure for simulating the markovian dynamics of the open system is therefore as follows : set the environment to its thermal equilibrium state , couple the open system to the environment modes and let the global system evolve for some time , then reset the state of the environment to its thermal equilibrium state .",
    "repeat this process many times and then read out the state of the open system .",
    "mathematically , the evolution of the open system in one step is expressed as @xmath74 = \\text{tr}_{b}\\left [ u(\\tau ) \\rho ^{j}(j\\tau ) u^{\\dag } ( \\tau ) \\right ] , j=0,1,2,\\dots\\]]where @xmath75 .",

    "one is interested in the value of some physical properties of the open system in the thermal - equilibrium state , such as various correlation functions , the partition function , etc .",
    "the thermal equilibrium state of the open system can be obtained by repeating the steps @xmath90 until the open system reaches its thermal equilibrium state  @xcite .",
    "note that the steps followed in implementing the algorithm explained above are the same as those used in the algorithm of ref .",
    "the goal of that work , however , is different from the goal of our work .",
    "our algorithm simulates the dynamics whereas the algorithm of ref .",
    "@xcite aims to prepare the thermal equilibrium state of the system .",
    "this difference in the purpose of the algorithm leads to a number of further differences .",
    "for example , in our case , we have to design the interaction hamiltonian and the parameters of the environment such that we accurately reproduce the spectral density of the environment . in ref .",
    "@xcite , one only requires that certain inequalities are satisfied in order for the environment register to act as a good environment .",
    "in other words , the exact speed of reaching thermal equilibrium is not a crucial issue in that work , as long as the thermal - equilibrium state is reached in polynomial time .",
    "in contrast , if for example there is some symmetry in the simulated system that prevents it from reaching the thermal - equilibrium state , then our algorithm would still be considered to work successfully if it produces the correct dynamics , even though the thermal - equilibrium state is never reached .      at this point",
    "we should make a few comments regarding the time scales involved in applying the algorithm .",
    "the time interval @xmath91 should be very short compared with @xmath57  ( so that the state of the open system changes slightly during @xmath91 ) .",
    "the time @xmath91 can be considered the memory time of the environment since the environment is reset to its thermal equilibrium state at every time interval @xmath91 .",
    "since the timescale for dynamics involving the system and a resonant mode of the environment is given by the inverse of @xmath92 times a matrix element between energy eigenstates of the system , the markovian condition would require that @xmath91 must be small compared to this timescale , such that that the change in the system s density matrix is small during the time @xmath91 .",
    "when constructing the model hamiltonian , the frequency spectrum of the environment is discretized into many elements where each element has a width @xmath93 .",
    "this width @xmath94 must be at most on the order of @xmath95 to make sure that the different @xmath30-peaks have large overlap and produce a smooth spectral density since the width of the @xmath30-peaks is on the order of @xmath95 .",
    "note that our algorithm can be straightforwardly generalized to simulate the markovian dynamics of an open system coupled to a time - dependent environment  [ see fig .",
    "@xmath96 . in each iteration ,",
    "the state of the environment register is reset to the time - dependent thermal equilibrium state of the time - dependent environment .",
    "the algorithm can also be generalized for the case of an open system that is simultaneously coupled to two or more different environments with different temperatures .      in the above procedure for simulating the dynamics of an open quantum system",
    ", we have assumed that each mode in the environment is represented by one qubit . in the quantum circuit shown in fig .",
    "@xmath97 , the environment quantum register @xmath78 is prepared in the thermal equilibrium state of all the environment qubits with all the different frequencies .",
    "the operator @xmath98 acts in the state space of the system qubits and all the environment qubits .    in this subsection , we show that one can reduce the number of qubits required to represent the environment by having each qubit represent multiple environment modes . in this approach",
    "each evolve - resetstep in the algorithm above is split into multiple evolve - reset steps , and in each one of those steps a qubit represents one environment mode . however , the qubit is reset to different frequencies in the different steps such that it produces the effect of multiple environment modes on the system . under certain conditions",
    "even a single qubit can be used to represent the entire environment : the parameters of this qubit are sequentially alternated between several different settings such that the sequence covers all the dissipation channels of the environment .    in the master equation shown in eq .",

    "an alternative approach for simulating the dynamics of an open system goes as follows : we divide the environment modes into a few sets and let the different sets interact with the open system sequentially .",
    "in this way , we effectively simulate the interaction between the open system and all the different modes in the environment .",

    "one point that requires a little bit extra care here is that each mode in the environment is coupled to the system in only one step out of @xmath109 steps , whereas the system hamiltonian @xmath1 is applied in all of the steps .",
    "one therefore needs to be careful how to calculate the elapsed time in the simulated system . if the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( @xmath110 ) is applied with a given value of @xmath91 , then after covering all the @xmath109 sets of environment modes the system hamiltonian would have induced a change corresponding to a time @xmath111 , while each environment mode would have induced a change corresponding to a time @xmath91 . in order to avoid any problems arising from this inconsistency , one can note that decoherence rates are proportional to the spectral density  ( and therefore proportional to @xmath112 ) from the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "one can then use a rescaled hamiltonian @xmath113if this hamiltonian is now applied for a time @xmath91 , then after covering all the different environment modes both the system hamiltonian and the coupling to the environment would have induced changes that correspond to a time @xmath111 , removing the inconsistency in the elapsed time .",

    "the noise spectrum of a noise signal is defined as  @xcite@xmath162 in order to generate the telegraph - noise signal  @xcite , we assume that the environment contains a number of fluctuators .",
    "each fluctuator switches between two possible configurations with switching rate @xmath163 , and couples to the system with a coupling strength @xmath164 .",
    "the corresponding contribution of a fluctuator to the noise spectrum is a lorentzian  @xcite , @xmath165 the  ( low - frequency ) noise spectrum of the entire environment is the sum of the noise spectra of all the fluctuators @xmath166 by adjusting the parameters @xmath163 and @xmath164 , one can produce a variety of noise spectra .",
    "a typical example in practical situations is @xmath167 noise .",
    "if the number and density of fluctuators is sufficiently large , and the distribution of the switching rates of the fluctuators @xmath168 , and is independent of the distribution of the coupling strengths between the fluctuators and the open system , the sum over the fluctuators produces the @xmath167 noise spectrum  @xcite @xmath169where @xmath170 is a constant .      the quantum algorithm presented above for simulating the markovian dynamics of an open system can also be used for simulating a class of non - markovian dynamics of open systems . a common situation where non - markovian dynamics occurs is the case where a small number of degrees of freedom in the environment are coherent enough that they have non - negligible memory effects in their interaction with the open system  @xcite .",
    "examples of this situation include the relaxation dynamics of an atom through a cavity that has a high quality factor  ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the relaxation dynamics of a superconducting qubit close to resonance with a coherent two - level defect  ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "when a small number of degrees of freedom in the environment are responsible for the non - markovian dynamics , and assuming that one has sufficient understanding of these degrees of freedom  ( i.e. their intrinsic hamiltonian , their coupling to the system and their decoherence mechanisms and rates ) , it becomes relatively straightforward to include them in the algorithm .",
    "one now adds the appropriate number of ancilla qubits needed to describe these degrees of freedom .",
    "when implementing the evolve - reset part of the algorithm , one treats the additional degrees of freedom as part of the system , i.e. they are not reset to their initial state .",
    "when the measurement is performed at the end of the algorithm , however , only the system qubits are used and the additional degrees of freedom are ignored .",
    "this step corresponds to taking the trace over the state of these degrees of freedom .",
    "the introduction of the additional degrees of freedom increases the resource requirements  ( which will be the subject of sec .",
    "iii ) as follows : the number of qubits used in implementing the unitary operation @xmath98 is increased by @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the number of degrees of freedom in the environment that are responsible for the non - markovian dynamics .",
    "since the interactions in the expanded system should still be local , the scaling of resources will still be polynomial in system+ancilla size and therefore efficient .",
    "our algorithm simulates the effect of the environment using a set of ancilla qubits that each represents one spin in a bath of independent spins  pro .",
    "this type of environment is rather straightforward to implement , since the properties and manipulation of the environment are done by considering the ancilla qubits one at a time . for a variety of purposes ,",
    "this spin bath is sufficient for the implementation of the desired quantum simulation .",
    "however , the spin bath has certain limitations .",
    "for example , the two - level nature of the environment elements  ( i.e. , spins ) means that increasing the temperature will reduce the number of spins that are in their ground states , thus reducing the relaxation rate induced by this environment  @xcite .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the case of a bath of harmonic oscillators , where both relaxation and excitation rates increase with increasing temperature .",
    "therefore , if one is interested in the temperature dependence of the dynamics , one needs to be careful about the differences between different types of environments .    one possible technique to use a spin bath in order to simulate an oscillator bath and obtain the correct temperature dependence is to calculate a modified  ( temperature - dependent ) spectral density for the spin bath and use this spectral density in the simulation . alternatively",
    ", different types of environments can be simulated by modifying the algorithm such that each element in the environment is encoded into multiple qubits that are treated as a single physical object .",
    "for example , one could use @xmath173 environment qubits to represent the lowest @xmath174 energy levels of a harmonic oscillator and then design a hamiltonian where this harmonic oscillator represents one mode in the environment .",
    "thus , one can simulate the dynamics of an open quantum system interacting with a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "note that the state preparation and the form of the hamiltonian become more complicated in this case than in the case of a spin bath .",
    "in this section , we discuss the resources including the number of qubits and the operations needed for implementing the algorithm .    as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath97 , the number of qubits required for simulating the markovian dynamics of the open system is @xmath175  ( here @xmath176 provides the smallest integer larger than @xmath177 , or equal to @xmath177 if @xmath177 is an integer ) , where @xmath178 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the open system and @xmath45 is the total number of qubits representing the environment . in the quantum estimator for the readout of the state of the open system , @xmath179",

    "one can see that in the region around @xmath190 , the numerical results are now in good agreement with the exact results .",

    "one can see that they are in good agreement with the exact results and that the different simulations give essentially the same results .",
    "we do not perform any numerical calculations for the simulation of pure dephasing using telegraph noise here , because such calculations would follow closely similar calculations that have been performed in the literature in theoretical studies of telegraph - noise - induced dephasing  ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an algorithm for simulating the markovian dynamics of an open quantum system .",
    "the algorithm takes as an input the hamiltonian of the open system , the operators through which the open system interacts with the environment , the spectral density of the environment and temperature .",
    "one therefore does not explicitly deal with the master equation describing the dynamics . in the simulation , the environment",
    "is represented by a set of ancilla qubits that are designed to have the same effect on the open system as the simulated environment .",
    "we have also shown that different dissipation channels can be implemented sequentially , thus reducing the number of qubits needed to represent the environment .",
    "pure dephasing also allows a reduction in the number of needed qubits , since it can be induced by a properly designed classical noise signal .",
    "the algorithm can also be used to simulate non - markovian dynamics .    in the present algorithm ,",
    "the ancilla qubits play a rather passive role in the sense that they only facilitate the dissipative dynamics of the system .",
    "these ancilla qubits could be used in a more active role as probes or actuators for the open quantum system . by monitoring the response of these ancilla qubits",
    "as they interact with the open system , one could obtain the energy spectrum of the system .",
