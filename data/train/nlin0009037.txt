    "the steady accumulation of data on all aspects of the very diverse ecosystems that exist on earth has revealed a number of generic features  @xcite .",
    "examples include ( i ) in species - rich ecosystems , the number of species , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 individuals following a power - law , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is close to one  @xcite , ( ii ) a relation between the number of species in the ecosystem , @xmath4 , and the connectance , @xmath5  defined as the number of predator - prey links between pairs of species divided by the total possible number of links  which has the hyperbolic form @xmath6 , with @xmath7 $ ]  @xcite , and ( iii ) other power - law distributions concerning the extinction of species , for instance , where the lifetime of species , @xmath8 , appears to be well - described by the distribution @xmath9 , with @xmath10 between 1.1 and 1.6  @xcite .",
    "there is an urgent need for models of ecosystems to be developed which will allow the underlying mechanisms which lead to these regularities to be understood .",
    "these models need to be defined for an arbitrary number of species , have a set of rules specifying the interaction between pairs of species which is reasonably simple and based on general features such as the competition between species , and have a stochastic element to reflect the randomness of events which are inherent in real systems . in ref @xcite a model of this type was introduced in order to investigate the generic features outlined above .",
    "an analysis of the model was begun in that paper , where both numerical and analytical work showed predictions of the model to be in agreement with field data .",
    "here we present a more detailed analysis of the model , using a variety of techniques , and compare the results of this analysis with that from real ecosystems .",
    "we begin by defining the model .",
    "the ecosystem under study is taken to have @xmath11 individuals and @xmath4 possible species .",
    "it is modeled as a directed graph with the nodes labelled by @xmath12 representing the species , and the links representing the ( predator - prey ) interaction between the species at the two nodes being joined .",
    "this interaction is assumed to be given by a single real number , denoted by @xmath13 for the link to @xmath14 from @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the interaction between the species in the ecosystem is completely specified by the @xmath16 real matrix @xmath17 .",
    "links from a node to itself are not allowed and therefore this matrix has zero entries on the diagonal .",
    "the antisymmetric matrix @xmath18 has a more direct interpretation as the  score \" of species @xmath15 against species @xmath14 :    * if @xmath19 , then @xmath14 acts as a resource for @xmath15 . *",
    "if @xmath20 , there is no interaction between @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "* if @xmath21 , then @xmath15 acts as a resource for @xmath14 .",
    "modelling multispecies ecosystems involving species - species interactions or connections of this type , has a long history  @xcite .",
    "originally , population dynamics equations , such as the lotka - volterra equations , were written down for two species and then for many species .",
    "if one imagines studying the equations near to any fixed point that might exist , it is permissable to linearize about the fixed points , and the entire model is then specified by a single @xmath16 matrix  the stability matrix .",
    "whereas , for systems involving two species it might be useful to calculate this matrix in terms of the original parameters of the model , for systems of many species there are simply too many parameters and so the emphasis changed to trying to investigate general properties that such matrices might have .",
    "an obvious , but crude , assumption that the entries were random , was first investigated by may  @xcite who found that the connectivity of the matrix was important in determining its stability properties . since then",
    ", this has remained a central issue in ecology  @xcite , as has the study of the abstract theory of species connected by a complex network of interactions  @xcite .",
    "having described the basic idea we will use in our approach , we now need to specify the interaction matrix @xmath17 .",
    "since , the connectivity seems to emerge as an important quantity in both theoretical and experimental studies we will assign a fixed conductivity @xmath22 to @xmath23 , so that we may study how properties of the system change as @xmath22 is varied . other than this , and the fact that the diagonal entries are zero , we will not impose any other restrictions on @xmath17 .",
    "we now have to define the dynamics .",
    "the goal is to define a set of rules which is simple , but which builds up a complex model ecosystem , after a sufficiently long time , showing the non - trivial emergent behavior mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "we do this by assigning the ( off - diagonal ) entries of @xmath17 , in a purely random way at @xmath24 , and updating the system at discrete time steps as follows . at each time step :    * with probability @xmath25 , pick two individuals at random .",
    "suppose they belong to species @xmath15 and @xmath14 and that @xmath26 .",
    "replace the individual belonging to the species which has a negative score against the other species by a new individual of the more successful species .",
    "so , for example , if @xmath19 , the total number of individuals belonging to species @xmath15 goes up by one , and the total belonging to species @xmath14 goes down by one . if @xmath20 , no action is taken . * with probability @xmath27 ,",
    "pick an individual at random .",
    "replace it by another individual of _ any _ of the @xmath4 species .",
    "these rules have an obvious interpretation .",
    "the first simply ensures that the most successful species , in the sense of the ones having the highest scores , grow at the expense of the less successful ones .",
    "however , if the dynamics consisted only of this rule , then eventually all species but one would go extinct . therefore",
    ", a second rule has to be introduced in order to obtain a diverse ecosystem .",
    "the simplest choice is to violate the first rule occasionally , by giving even unsuccessful species an opportunity through purely random events .",
    "this is best not thought of as a mutation or speciation , but as an immigration event from an area outside the ecosystem under study .",
    "we have not specified the initial distribution of the entries in @xmath17 and there is a certain amount of freedom regarding this choice . in our simulations",
    "we have chosen the @xmath28 randomly from a uniform distribution on @xmath29 $ ] , but any other choice is equally valid , since only the sign of @xmath30 is important . since the probability that @xmath31 is vanishingly small , it is almost certain that if the condition @xmath20 mentioned in rule 1 holds , then both @xmath13 and @xmath32 are zero , and species @xmath15 and @xmath14 are not connected by a predator - prey relationship .",
    "since the probability of any matrix element being zero is @xmath33 , the probability that both @xmath13 and @xmath32 are zero is @xmath34 , and from what has been said above , the probability that @xmath30 is non - zero is @xmath35 .    for those simulations that start with no species in the system , a generalized @xmath36 real matrix @xmath37 with an extra row and column denoted by 0 needs to be introduced .",
    "then , if @xmath38 , empty space acts as a resource for @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath39 , then species @xmath15 fails to invade empty space .",
    "so , on average , the expected number of species that can actually invade empty space is @xmath40 and the number of species in the pool that can never interact with empty space is @xmath41 .",
    "what has been described above is a strongly interacting , stochastic multispecies model and as such is extremely difficult to study analytically .",
    "it is , however , relatively easy to simulate , given the straightforward nature of the algorithm described above , and we will discuss the results of extensive numerical studies in later sections of this paper .",
    "it would still be very useful to have some approximate treatment available which would , at the very least , help to suggest forms which could be use to fit the data and simulations .",
    "fortunately , we can do much better than this . a mean field theory of the above model yields a master equation which can be analysed using a number of standard techniques .",
    "much of the paper will be concerned with the derivation of these results and their subsequent interpretation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the master equation within the mean field approximation and in section iii we investigate the nature of the stationary state .",
    "the time - dependent properties are the subject of the next two sections : within a gaussian approximation in section iv and a more general study in section v. we conclude with a summary of the work presented in the paper in section vi .",
    "there are two appendices : appendix a and appendix b contain technical details which are used to derive some of the results in sections iii and v respectively .",
    "in this section we will derive a master equation which approximately describes the complex dynamics introduced in section i. the key simplification is the use of a type of mean field theory .",
    "we focus on one of the @xmath4 species , which we shall call species @xmath42 .",
    "the other @xmath43 species are no longer distinguished as separate species and are simply lumped together and denoted as species @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath44 species will be regarded as some kind of average species  a kind of effective background population  with which species @xmath42 interacts .",
    "there are various assumptions inherent in this approach .",
    "for instance , that the rate of reproduction is the same for all species , so that a typical species ( @xmath42 ) can be picked out as representative .",
    "it does however , reduce the model to one in which just two species are interacting , namely @xmath42 and non-@xmath45 .",
    "it is now relatively straightforward to derive a master equation which describes the dynamics of this process .    to derive this equation",
    ", first suppose that @xmath46 for simplicity .",
    "then only rule 1 is in operation . in picking two individuals from a set of @xmath11 individuals of the @xmath4 species ,",
    "the following situations arise : ( a ) both individuals belong to species @xmath42 , ( b ) one belongs to @xmath42 and the other to @xmath44 and ( c ) both individuals belong to species @xmath44 . in cases ( a ) and ( c ) there is no action taken under rule 1 . the probability of case ( b ) occurring is the sum of the probability that first an @xmath42 is selected and then a @xmath44 and the probability that a @xmath44 is selected and then an @xmath42 : @xmath47 where @xmath1 is the number of individuals of species @xmath42 in the ecosystem .",
    "we now have to focus on the quantity @xmath48 in order to implement the rule .",
    "the probability that it is non - zero is @xmath5 and we would expect that , on average , half of the events the individual from species @xmath42 will have a higher score than the individual from species @xmath44 i.e. @xmath49 and the other half of the events to have @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the probability that at each time step the number of species @xmath42 increases by one is @xmath50 and the probability that at each time step the number of species @xmath42 decreases by one is @xmath51 we will show shortly that this process leads to a stationary probability distribution which is non - zero only if @xmath52 or @xmath53 , that is , only if either species @xmath42 dies out completely or dominates completely .",
    "the second rule ensures that some diversity is retained .",
    "so suppose that we now include the second rule .",
    "the transition probabilities above have now to be multiplied by @xmath54 and those involving the second rule will involve a factor @xmath27 .",
    "specifically , the probability that the individual picked , when implementing the second rule , is replaced by an individual of a _ given _ species is @xmath55 . if we ask that this given species is @xmath42 , then since the probability that the individual picked belongs to species @xmath44 is @xmath56 , the additional probability due to rule 2 that at each time step the number of species @xmath42 is increased by one is @xmath57 similarly , the probability that an individual is replaced by an individual of a different species is @xmath58 .",
    "since the probability that the individual picked belongs to species @xmath42 is @xmath59 , the additional probability that at each time step the number of species @xmath42 is decreased by one is @xmath60 putting the two rules together , gives the one - step transition probabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 as @xmath63 and @xmath64 we can now write down a master equation describing this one - step stochastic process  @xcite",
    ". if @xmath65 is the probability of species @xmath42 having @xmath1 individuals at time @xmath66 , the master equation takes the form @xmath67 equation ( [ master ] ) is only valid for values of @xmath1 not on the boundary ( i.e. for @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) ; for these values special equations have to be written reflecting the fact that no transitions out of the region @xmath70 $ ] are allowed .",
    "however , from ( [ gn ] ) and ( [ rn ] ) we see that @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and if additionally we define @xmath73 and @xmath74 , then ( [ master ] ) holds for all @xmath75 . to completely specify the system we also need to give an initial condition , which will typically have the form @xmath76 for some non - negative integer @xmath77 .",
    "we will end this section by determining the stationary probability distribution , @xmath78 . setting @xmath79 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath80 this is true for all @xmath1 , which implies that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a constant .",
    "applying the boundary condition at @xmath52 , we find that @xmath83 and therefore @xmath84 if @xmath85 , then @xmath86 for all @xmath1 such that @xmath87 , and therefore @xmath88 the constant @xmath89 can be determined from the normalization condition @xmath90 @xmath91 at this point it is convenient to introduce a set of combinations of the constants of the model which will appear frequently in the analysis .",
    "these are : @xmath92\\ \\ , \\ \\",
    "\\lambda^*=\\mu^*(n-1)\\ ] ] @xmath93 the transition probabilities ( [ gn ] ) and ( [ rn ] ) may now be written in the more compact form @xmath94 substituting ( [ gnrn ] ) into ( [ invps(0 ) ] ) gives @xmath95 this sum takes the form of a jacobi polynomial @xmath96",
    "@xcite , with @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which can itself be expressed in terms of gamma functions for this value of @xmath100 .",
    "so using ( [ ps ] ) we find @xmath101 in various intermediate expressions we have assumed that @xmath102 is not an integer , but this final result is well defined for all meaningful ranges of the parameters , since from ( [ newconsts ] ) we can see that @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "moreover @xmath105 for all @xmath75 and @xmath106 by construction . by introducing the beta function @xmath107 , the stationary ,",
    "normalized solution can be written in the more compact form @xmath108 finally , if @xmath46 , @xmath109 , so ( [ ps ] ) no longer holds for @xmath53 . using the result that @xmath110 in this case",
    ", one finds that @xmath111 for @xmath112 . by normalization",
    "we can write @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a constant .",
    "so , as mentioned earlier , either species @xmath42 is the only surviving species or it goes extinct . in other words , in the stationary state only one species survives . since all species are assumed identical , it follows that when @xmath46 @xmath116 although we have obtained the exact solution for the stationary distribution ( [ ps(n)_gamma ] ) in terms of nothing more complicated than gamma functions , we still need to simplify it if we are to compare the result with data . in the next section",
    ", we will derive simpler forms for the stationary probability distribution which are valid in different regions of the parameter space of the model , and compare these with simulations .",
    "we have so far been discussing the stationary state from the point of view of a time - independent solution of the master equation .",
    "but let us now ask the question in a biological context : are ecological communities in stable equilibria ? although is obvious that environmental variability and chance have a great impact on ecosystems , some well - defined , time - independent , patterns arise when natural ecosystems are observed .",
    "the model we have introduced reaches a well - established dynamic stationary state which allows us to study some of these patterns .",
    "a particular example of interest is the way that individuals are distributed among species . in any island where colonization from the mainland and local extinction take place",
    ", a dynamical equilibrium between these two processes is reached  @xcite . in these situations",
    "our model applies and can help to understand the patterns observed .",
    "highly diverse ecological communities are formed when a large number of different species are present .",
    "the estimation and characterization of such biological diversity is not only a central issue in theoretical ecology , but also a question of practical concern for nature reserve design and conservation biology in general . in any ecological community species vary considerably in the number of individuals that belong to that species .",
    "some species are very difficult to find because they are very rare .",
    "some of them are extremely common .",
    "how are individuals distributed among species ?",
    "what factors affect this distribution ?",
    "the classic way of studying this topic is by means of species abundance relations  the  relations between abundance and the number of species possessing that abundance \"  @xcite .",
    "different types of species abundance relations have been used to fit to real species abundance data .",
    "some of them have been justified on theoretical grounds ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "one of the most widely used species abundance distribution was first discussed by fisher , corbet and williams in 1943  @xcite .",
    "the distribution is defined by two parameters @xmath100 and @xmath117 : @xmath118 where @xmath0 is the number of species having @xmath1 individuals .",
    "since ( [ log - series_0 ] ) summed over @xmath1 gives a logarithm , this is known as the logseries distribution .",
    "it is very common as a sampling distribution in the ecological literature , although it has also been derived on theoretical grounds  @xcite .",
    "the abundance distribution that has received more attention from ecologists , however , was introduced by preston in one of the most influential papers on ecological theory  @xcite . as may remarks  theory and observation points to its ubiquity once @xmath119 , when relative abundances must be governed by the conjunction of a variety of independent factors \"  @xcite .",
    "the distribution is the lognormal distribution , so called because the logarithm of species abundances is normally distributed : @xmath120 where , following preston s definitions , @xmath121 is a logarithmic measure of the abundance in relation to @xmath122  the abundance value where the distribution has its maximum .",
    "so , @xmath123 is the number of species having their logarithmic relative abundance between @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "notice that both equations ( [ log - series_0 ] ) and ( [ log - normal_0 ] ) must be divided by the total number of species to be properly understood as estimations of the probability distribution function .    in this section",
    "we want to compare the exact result for @xmath126 with these two distributions  the most widely used abundance distributions in the ecological arena .",
    "we will derive simpler forms for the stationary probability distribution which are valid in different regions of the parameter space of the model , and compare these with simulations of the original model ( that is , without making the mean - field approximation ) .",
    "lognormal and logseries distributions will naturally emerge for different well - defined immigration regimes . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will analyse a large quantity of species abundance data from different ecological communities in detail .",
    "we begin by discussing one situation in which the logseries distribution occurs .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to rewrite the result ( [ ps(n)_gamma ] ) for @xmath78 by breaking it down into three separate parts : @xmath127 where @xmath128 + \\lambda^{*})}{\\gamma(\\nu^ { * } - n ) } \\ \\",

    "\\label{defeffs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will now give a simpler form for each of these expressions , being careful to state the range of validity of our approximations in each case .",
    "details of the derivation of these results is given in appendix a. the non - trivial behavior occurs for relatively small values of @xmath1 , so in what follows we will only be interested in values of @xmath1 up to @xmath129 , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we will also suppose that there are many possible species : @xmath132 .    from eqns .",
    "( [ simple_f1 ] ) and ( [ simple_f3 ] ) we have that @xmath133 and @xmath134 therefore ( [ effs])-([f3 ] ) give @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "this is the logseries ( [ log - series_0 ] ) with @xmath137 and expressed as the fraction of species represented by @xmath1 individuals in the steady state .",
    "note that ( [ log - series_0 ] ) , by contrast , gives the absolute number of species with a given abundance @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath138 , the condition @xmath139 is redundant when the stronger condition @xmath140 is imposed .",
    "therefore , ( [ logseries ] ) holds when @xmath141 to find an approximate form for @xmath142 , we use ( [ simple_f2 ] ) which gives an approximate form for @xmath143 . under the very reasonable conditions that @xmath144 is much less than @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath4 , but with @xmath147 , we find @xmath148 fig [ ibm1 ] shows the results of different simulations which have been performed for increasing values of the immigration parameter . in order to calculate the species relative abundance distribution an ensemble average has been performed . for each plot",
    "a collection of 2000 replicas has been simulated . for each replica the probability distribution @xmath65 has been calculated after 500000 simulation time steps . in fig [ ibm1 ] , the @xmath144 values increase from @xmath149 when @xmath150 to @xmath151 when @xmath152 .",
    "the last three plots do not show such a good match with the logseries approximation as the first three .",
    "even in the upper three plots , where there appears to be a good fit with the logseries , we would only expect a complete match for @xmath153 . from ( [ conditions ] ) , we should bear in mind that this is only expected to be true as long as @xmath154 . for instance , @xmath155 for @xmath156 ( for the parameter set @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) and @xmath160 is @xmath161 when @xmath162 .    in fig [ ibm ] two simulation results",
    "are displayed .",
    "the stationary solution is also shown in both cases for comparison purposes .",
    "the stationary solution is calculated numerically either by direct application of equation ( [ ps(n)_gamma ] ) , as has been done in fig [ ibm1 ] , or by means of an algorithm that can find the stationary probability distribution of any one - step stochastic process if it exists , as in fig [ ibm ] .",
    "this algorithm is based on the subroutine tridag  @xcite . to describe it ,",
    "we first write the master equation ( [ master ] ) in the more general form : @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "if we now introduce @xmath166 and the vector @xmath167 , ( [ master_gen ] ) may be written in the matrix form @xmath168 finding the stationary stationary distribution @xmath126  the vector @xmath169  is then equivalent to solving a system of @xmath170 linear equations @xmath171 in @xmath170 unknowns : @xmath172 . in any one - step stochastic process",
    "the matrix @xmath173 is tridiagonal .",
    "our algorithm takes advantage of this feature to solve the system .",
    "another quantity which is useful in comparing model predictions to data is the average number of species in the stationary state , which we denote by @xmath174 .",
    "let @xmath175 be the probability that there are @xmath1 individuals of species @xmath15 in the ecosystem .",
    "therefore the probability that there is at least one individual of species @xmath15 is @xmath176 and so the average number of species is @xmath177 . within the mean field approximation @xmath178",
    "is the same for all species @xmath15 : @xmath179 ( the subscript @xmath180 denotes  stationary \" , as before ) , so that @xmath181 under the conditions @xmath147 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , we show in appendix a that ( see eq .",
    "( [ simple_s ] ) ) @xmath184 where @xmath185 ( see fig [ conn_0 ] ) . inverting this relationship",
    "gives @xmath186 with @xmath187 .",
    "the condition @xmath147 is essentially equivalent to @xmath188 ( for a connectance that is not too small ) . for systems of interest",
    "@xmath11 is very large , and hence @xmath27 must typically be very small if the hyperbolic relation ( [ cs ] ) is to hold .",
    "such a tiny value of @xmath27 means that @xmath189 and hence @xmath190 , will be close to zero .",
    "the form of the relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath174 when the immigration parameter has a larger value will be discussed elsewhere .    in fig [ conn ]",
    "the species - connectivity relationship calculated from the individual modelling approach is shown . after carrying out 600000 simulation steps ,",
    "a 1000 ensemble average was calculated for each connectivity value .",
    "the initial condition is the empty system .",
    "although our mean field approximation captures the essentials of the hyperbolic - like behavior of the species - connectivity relationship , there is a systematic deviation from the mean field prediction in the simulated curves .    to sum up",
    ", the exact solution given in ( [ ps(n)_beta ] ) admits a logseries representation for low immigration regimes .",
    "for these low immigration values a hyperbolic - like relation is also observed between the mean number of species in the stationary state and the connectivity level given by the _ trophic _",
    "relationships pre - defined in the community matrix , @xmath17 .",
    "we will now argue that the exact stationary distribution probability is also very well approximated by a lognormal distribution for intermediate to high immigration regimes as shown in figs [ fig_3 ] and [ ibm ] .",
    "the idea behind the analysis we will present , is to find at which values of @xmath1 , if any , @xmath126 has a maximum .",
    "we then expand @xmath126 about this maximum to see to what extent this function can be analytically described by a lognormal distribution .",
    "first of all , from fig [ fig_3 ] , we can see that @xmath126 may admit a gaussian representation for some parameter values .",
    "so let us look at this case first , before discussing the lognormal .",
    "to investigate for what parameter values this may occur , we first find the position of the maximum of @xmath78 .",
    "it is more convenient to consider @xmath191 rather than @xmath126 . from ( [ ps(n)_gamma ] ) , we get : @xmath192 where @xmath193 setting ( [ d_gamma ] ) equal to zero gives the maximum value of @xmath126 at @xmath194 .",
    "if all arguments of the psi - functions can be considered to be large enough , which is true if @xmath195 but reasonably large ( e.g. @xmath196 ) , these functions can be approximated using @xmath197  @xcite .",
    "so , @xmath198 from which one finds that the maximum is given by : @xmath199 from ( [ maximum ] ) we can see that if @xmath200 ( very low immigration regimes ) , the numerator and denominator are both negative and a maximum exists .",
    "however it is inadmissible , since it violates the condition @xmath201 .",
    "therefore , a necessary condition for the existence of a maximum , @xmath202 , is that @xmath203 .",
    "now , we perform a taylor expansion of ( [ ps(n)_gamma ] ) about @xmath202 to quadratic order . if @xmath204 , then for @xmath205 small : @xmath206 since @xmath202 is a maximum , @xmath207 , and so we set this equal to @xmath208 .",
    "then ignoring the @xmath209 terms and exponentiating gives @xmath210 under this approximation ( @xmath195 , but reasonably large ) it is not very difficult to derive an analytical expression for the variance : @xmath211    since the gaussian distribution is completely specified by its first two cumulants , fixing @xmath202 and @xmath212 given by ( [ maximum ] ) and ( [ normal_variance ] ) respectively , determines the entire curve .",
    "the dotted lines in fig [ fig_3 ] show this curve i.e. ( [ normal ] ) with the two parameters fixed by ( [ maximum ] ) and ( [ normal_variance ] ) .",
    "the upper two plots show very good agreement with the exact mean field approximation ; in the lower two plots the agreement is not so good .    to approximate the exact stationary solution as a lognormal distribution ( [ log - normal_0 ] )",

    "the figure shows that the lognormal approximation matches the exact solution well for intermediate to high immigration regimes .",
    "we also note that , in general , the lognormal is a better fit to the exact solution than the gaussian .",
    "lognormal and logseries distributions have been used by ecologists to fit real abundance data for years  @xcite .",
    "our results show that it is possible for both distributions to stem from the same general ecological process under different immigration regimes . if , for instance , we counted species abundances in a small area within a wood , the lognormal distribution would probably arise since that area is no doubt weakly isolated from the rest of the wood by external immigration .",
    "the same experiment performed in a rather isolated area might be expected to give rise to an empirical relative abundance distribution well fitted by a logseries function .",
    "finally , in this section we calculate the diversity , @xmath234 , of the ecosystem ( also called the shannon entropy ) for our model in the stationary state .",
    "it is defined by @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the probability that an individual selected at random from the system belongs to species @xmath15  @xcite . clearly , @xmath237 , where @xmath238 is the number of individuals of species @xmath15 in the stationary state . on the other hand , within our mean field approach",
    ", the quantity which we can calculate is @xmath126  the probability that a typical species will have @xmath1 individuals in the system when it is in the stationary state .",

    "it can be seen that for relatively low immigration rates the system tends to be saturated admitting as many species as possible . as immigration increases , the shannon entropy grows steeper than the number of species does , meaning that immigration tends to equalize the number of individuals of different species first , rather than increase the actual number of species in the system .    in figs [ conn ] and [ entropy ]",
    "it can be seen that ensemble average curves for the expected number of species in the stationary state deviate systematically from the mean field approximation that we have implemented through the master equation ( [ master ] ) , even though they show the same qualitative behaviour .",
    "the explanation for this slight disagreement comes from the way we are estimating the probability of an effective interaction within the system . when transition probabilities are discussed ( eqns .",
    "( [ gn ] ) and ( [ rn ] ) ) , the probability of interaction is split into a product of the probability of picking two potential interacting individuals multiplied by the probability of having an actual link between the species they belong to .",
    "however , these two events are not independent .",
    "the assumption of independence is just an approximation that allows us to simplify the system and get some insight into the dynamical processes that take place during simulations . in particular , for any parameter choice , the individual based model has more interactions than expected and can not maintain the same number of species as predicted by our mean field approximation .",
    "what can our model say about the assembly of an ecological community ? whenever species colonize a new island or any empty space , a new community builds up from scratch .",
    "the process that takes place is called succession by ecologists .",
    "the assembly of an ecological community has been studied both from the theoretical and empirical point of view .",
    "many patterns have been found during the process of ecological succession ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "for instance , the number of species grows in a particular way that depends on the immigration from a biogeographical species pool .",
    "if our model is to make any prediction about succession , simulation time must have a direct meaning in terms of physical time . in our model",
    "the only connection to physical time comes from the immigration parameter , but the model has in fact two time scales .",
    "the external one is defined by the flux of individuals from the biogeographical pool and the internal one is defined by the flux of individuals ( birth - death process ) as a consequence of the internal dynamics ( pairwise random encounters ) within the system .",
    "our immigration parameter captures the relative importance of these two different temporal processes .",
    "therefore , having investigated the properties of the stationary state in the last section , we now move on to the study of the time evolution of the system within the mean - field approximation .",
    "the master equation ( [ master ] ) has transition probabilities @xmath244 and @xmath245 which are non - linear in @xmath1 , so that an exact solution for the time - dependent behavior is not possible .",
    "however , since in the problem of interest @xmath11 is very large , the possibility of performing a large-@xmath11 analysis suggests itself . in this section",
    "we will describe the application of such an analysis  specifically van kampen s large-@xmath11 method  @xcite  to our model .",
    "this method has a number of attractive features , for instance , the macroscopic ( i.e. deterministic ) equation emerges naturally from the stochastic equation as a leading order effect in @xmath11 , with the next to leading order giving the gaussian broadening of @xmath65 about this average motion .",
    "the method is clearly presented in  @xcite , so we will only give a brief outline of the general idea and stress the application to the model of interest in this paper .    if we take the initial condition on ( [ master ] ) to be @xmath76 , we would expect , at early times at least , @xmath65 to have a sharp peak at some value of @xmath1 ( of order @xmath11 ) , with a width of order @xmath246 . it is therefore , natural to transform from the stochastic variable @xmath1 to the stochastic variable @xmath247 by writing @xmath248 where @xmath249 is some unknown macroscopic function which will have to be chosen to follow the peak in time",
    ". a new probability distribution @xmath250 is defined by @xmath251 , which implies that @xmath252 the master equation ( [ master ] ) may be written @xmath253 where @xmath254 ( @xmath255 ) is an operator which changes @xmath1 into @xmath256 ( @xmath257 ) , e.g. if @xmath258 is an arbitrary function of @xmath1 , then @xmath259 . in terms of @xmath247 : @xmath260 using ( [ ntoxi])-([operators ] ) the original master equation for @xmath65 can be rewritten as an equation for @xmath261 . by rescaling the time according to @xmath262 , a hierarchy of equations can be derived by identifying terms order by order in powers of @xmath263 .",
    "the first two of these are : @xmath264 and @xmath265 where @xmath266 the first equation ( [ macroscopic ] ) is the macroscopic equation for @xmath267 .",
    "it is easily solved to give @xmath268 initially we ask that @xmath269 , which means that @xmath270 .",
    "going back to the @xmath66 variable gives @xmath271 the second equation ( [ fp ] ) is a linear fokker - planck equation whose coefficients depend on time through @xmath272 given by ( [ phi_t ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the solution to this equation is a gaussian and so it is only necessary to determine @xmath273 and @xmath274 to completely characterize @xmath261 . by multiplying ( [ fp ] ) by @xmath247 and @xmath275 and using integration by parts ,",
    "one finds  @xcite @xmath276 in our case @xmath277 and so @xmath278 since we have already assumed that @xmath279 .",

    "the gaussian behavior is lost for large times . in figure [ gaussian2 ] the gaussian behavior",
    "is maintained longer due to a higher immigration rate ; as the immigration rates increase still further , the gaussian form persists for even larger times .    in order to compare the time behavior of the mean field approach introduced in this work through the master equation ( [ master ] ) with the time behavior of the individual based model ( ibm ) defined by the rules presented in section i",
    ", one should carefully define what is meant by time .",
    "individual based simulations are performed by the iteration of an algorithm from the first step up to a given number of updating steps . in section 1",
    ", such an updating step has been defined as a time unit .",
    "let us call it the simulation time unit . in  @xcite",
    "a different operational choice was made .",
    "whatever the convention is , a clear distinction must be made between the simulation time and the physical time needed to compare simulation results with either the numerical integration of the master equation ( [ master ] ) or the large-@xmath11 solution derived in this section .",
    "the question then arises : how is physical time to be tracked in any stochastic realization of the ibm ? to analyze this point we will follow an argument given by renshaw  @xcite . at any time @xmath66 , the probability of an event occurring in the system can be estimated .",
    "such a probability depends on the system configuration , i.e , the abundance of all present species , and on the relative immigration rate @xmath27 in relation to the internal dynamics rate @xmath285 .",
    "both rates have dimensions of @xmath286 . obviously , it depends also on the other parameters of the model ( @xmath11 , @xmath4 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "although the method described in ref @xcite estimates every transition probability rate for all possible events in the system , there is no need to estimate the probability of this rather high number of possible events .",
    "there are only two relevant temporal processes : immigration and internal dynamics .",
    "so , it is enough to consider these two different possibilities :    1 .",
    "an immigration event @xmath287 occurs if any species from the pool happens to enter the system .",
    "the probability of a pool species entering the system in any small @xmath288 is : @xmath289 where the immigration rate is @xmath290 2 .",
    "an internal dynamics event @xmath291 occurs when the interaction between a pair of individuals from two potentially interacting species gives rise to a change in their abundances .",
    "the probability of such an event occurring in any small @xmath288 can be written as : @xmath292 where the internal dynamics rate is @xmath293 and where @xmath294 must be understood as the set of species  different from @xmath15  that are connected to @xmath15 through the pre - defined interaction matrix @xmath17 .",
    "since the two events defined are independent from each other , the probability of occurrence of any one of them in any small @xmath288 is : @xmath295 when an event occurs there is a change in the actual configuration of the system either by immigration or by internal dynamics and the rates must be calculated again .",
    "so , approximately , on average the number of such effective events in any time interval of length @xmath66 would be @xmath296 , and would be distributed as a poisson random variable with that mean .",
    "the important point is that now the probability of having no events in any time interval of length @xmath66 , i.e , for any time between @xmath297 and @xmath66 , can be written as : @xmath298 according to ( [ exp ] ) , the probability of having at least one event is @xmath299  the cumulative probability distribution for an exponentially distributed random variable .",
    "therefore , the time to the next event is an exponentially distributed random variable with expectation @xmath300 .",
    "then , we should sample that distribution in order to predict when the next effective event will take place . accumulating these inter - event times during simulations we are able to track the physical time , which have the same units as @xmath301^{-1}$ ] , so the same time units which arise in the master equation ( [ master ] ) .    in figure [ time_evo ] ,",
    "the time evolution of the number of species in the system is shown .",
    "different stochastic realizations of the ibm are presented .",
    "the numerical integration of the master equation allows the estimation of the expected number of species at any time in the system @xmath302 through ( [ defavs ] ) .",
    "the average behavior of the different stochastic simulations is well captured by the prediction given by ( [ defavs ] ) where @xmath303 is computed at each numerical integration time step .    in fig [ tempo ]",
    "the probability of having a species represented by @xmath1 individuals at particular early times , @xmath65 , has been plotted .",
    "it has been computed by performing a numerical integration of the master equation ( [ master ] ) ( dotted line ) and by means an ensemble average for the individual - based model after 5000 simulation time steps .",
    "two extremely different initial conditions have been used . in the first one , there are no species in the system at time @xmath297 .",
    "species enter the system and either establish themselves in it or not , performing what could be called a stochastic community assembly . in the second initial state ,",
    "all species are represented in approximately equal numbers .",
    "obviously , the one - humped distributions are obtained when the initial condition is a random mixture of species , which is represented by @xmath304 if @xmath305 and @xmath306 if @xmath307 in the master equation approach .",
    "the purely decreasing distributions are obtained when the initial state is a completely empty system .",
    "the agreement between the mean field approach represented by the master equation and the simulations is seen to be reasonable .    as it has been shown in figs [ gaussian1 ] and [ gaussian2 ] ,",
    "eventually , the probability distribution deviates from a gaussian .",
    "while it is true that one could in principle calculate these non - gaussian effects using van kampen s approach ( by taking higher order terms in @xmath263 into account ) , the method gets increasingly cumbersome . therefore , in the next section",
    ", we adopt a totally different approach to the calculation of time - dependence , which is able to give information about @xmath65 at late times .",
    "the technique we will use to probe the time - dependence of @xmath65 in this section is based on the solution of the differential equation satisfied by the generating function @xmath308 for our model in the mean - field approximation .",
    "starting from ( [ master ] ) the derivation of this equation proceeds along standard lines  @xcite to yield @xmath309 where we have introduced a new time @xmath310 and where the constants @xmath117 , @xmath311 and @xmath3 are defined by @xmath312 @xmath313 the conditions on @xmath314 are @xmath315 and follow from the normalization condition @xmath316 and the initial condition @xmath76 respectively .",

    "we therefore have @xmath336 linear conditions for the @xmath336 constants @xmath337 ( @xmath338 ) , and so can determine them uniquely .",
    "thus , ( [ final_form ] ) together with ( [ finding_wk ] ) provide a complete solution to the partial differential equation ( [ pde ] ) .    although the solution is not in closed form , it is possible to obtain the @xmath337 for small values of @xmath339 rather easily . for @xmath340 , ( [ finding_wk ] )",

    "these results are very useful because , as is clear from ( [ final_form ] ) , the large - time behavior of the system is governed by small values of @xmath339 . in this case , as we will now show , an explicit form for @xmath65 can be found .    to find @xmath65 we have the identify the coefficient of @xmath345 in ( [ final_form ] ) . in appendix",
    "b it is shown that this leads to @xmath346 where @xmath347 this result appears to be rather complicated , but fortunately it simplifies in many cases of interest .",
    "for instance , suppose we wish to find @xmath303 : the time - evolution of the probability that there are no individuals of the species present in the system .",
    "since @xmath348 has only one term in the sum ( @xmath349 ) , @xmath350 which describes the approach to the stationary state at large times . in fig [ fig19 ] the temporal evolution of the expected number of species , estimated as @xmath351 is shown .",
    "the temporal solution provided by this method is exact as long as the total number of coefficients can be computed without numerical error . in fig",
    "[ fig19 ] a truncated , approximated solution is compared with the straightforward numerical integration of the master equation .",
    "complete agreement is observed at large times .",
    "if @xmath68 , the large time behavior of @xmath65 still has a relatively simple form : @xmath352 where @xmath353 has only two terms , @xmath354 and @xmath355 ( only one if @xmath356 or @xmath53 ) and @xmath357 has only three terms , @xmath358 and @xmath1 ( fewer if @xmath359 or @xmath11 ) .    in fig [ fig20 ] , the computation of @xmath65 for @xmath360 is shown .",
    "the solution is approximate because again just the first 20 @xmath361 have been considered , although ( [ final_result ] ) would be an exact solution as long as all of the terms from @xmath362 to @xmath363 could be summed without numerical error . for practical reasons this is obviously not possible . in particular , at early times , the truncation of ( [ final_result ] ) introduces errors in @xmath65 .",
    "the same is true when @xmath1 is too large , because the sums in ( [ finding_wk ] ) and ( [ full_chi ] ) are too long to be computed without errors and some numerical instabilities arise .",
    "in this paper we have analysed a model which has a structure which is rich enough to show many of the underlying patterns seen in real ecosystems , but is still sufficiently simple for a variant of the mean field approximation to be applied to obtain analytical results . the most straightforward question that can be asked concerns the nature of the stationary state . within the mean field approximation an exact form for this stationary distribution",
    "may be derived .",
    "we found that this exact result reduced to the logseries distribution in the regime of low immigration and to the lognormal distribution in the regime of moderate to high immigration .",
    "these two distributions have been discussed by ecologists for decades as possible forms for the species abundance distributions .",
    "our approach gives a clear interpretation to the parameters on which they depend .",
    "this fact has practical consequences for conservation biology in order to determine the potential richness ( @xmath4 ) , the global size ( @xmath11 ) and the degree of isolation ( @xmath364 ) of a community .",
    "we have therefore shown how logseries and lognormal distributions can arise as two different limits of a single distribution , a distribution which is , moreover , the stationary distribution of a well - motivated ecological model .",
    "we also found evidence for the hyperbolic relation between the connectivity and the average number of species  the so - called @xmath365 relation . while we were able to derive this result in the low immigration regime",
    ", there was a small systematic derivation from the mean - field result and the simulation curves .",
    "while the stationary distribution is of considerable interest , the strength of the approach that we have adopted here is that predictions of the time evolution of the system are also possible .",
    "an approximation based on the number of individuals in the system being large led to the picture of @xmath65 as an approximately gaussian distribution broadening and moving with time .",
    "this behavior may persist for quite a long time , especially when the immigration rate is high , but eventually the gaussian form is lost at large times . to explore the approach to the stationary distribution",

    "this solution @xmath65 is given as a series expansion around the stationary state .",
    "in particular , such a solution allows one to predict quite well how the number of species in the system increases with time during the stochastic assembly process .    in summary , we believe that this simple model has illuminated the general mechanisms at work in ecosystems and has allowed us to understand the broad features of some of the universal phenomena seen in these systems . we hope that the results presented here will motivate further work both in the increasingly sophisticated stochastic modelling of ecosystems and in the interpretation of ecological data within a theoretical framework .",

    "so define @xmath409 and @xmath410 . then from ( [ abc ] ) , @xmath411 - \\sqrt{\\left [ 1 - \\lambda^{*}s \\right]^{2 } + 4\\lambda}}{2}\\nonumber \\\\ \\tilde{b } & = & \\frac{\\left [ 1 - \\lambda^{*}s \\right ] + \\sqrt{\\left [ 1 - \\lambda^{*}s \\right]^{2 } + 4\\lambda}}{2}\\ , , \\label{tildes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath412 .",
    "since the constants @xmath375 and @xmath413 appear in the differential equation ( [ hyper ] ) symmetrically , we have made a choice as to which has the positive and which has the negative square root . from the general theory of the master equation  @xcite , the eigenvalues @xmath319 are real and non - negative , and so @xmath414 and @xmath415 are real . moreover , if @xmath416 , they are of different signs , since their product is negative . with the choice ( [ tildes ] ) , @xmath417 and @xmath418 . from these results",
    "we deduce that @xmath419 diverges and @xmath420 as @xmath408 .",
    "we must therefore take @xmath421 for all @xmath422 . when @xmath423 , @xmath424 , which may be negative , and so we also take @xmath425 . finally , @xmath426 when @xmath423 and so this term is the only one which is not zero or does not diverge as @xmath408 .",
    "since the @xmath423 solution is the stationary solution , the condition @xmath405 is automatically satisfied as long as the stationary solution is normalized .",
    "therefore , the application of this condition has reduced ( [ gensoln ] ) to @xmath427 where @xmath428 .    before proceeding any further ,",
    "we need to investigate the sum over @xmath319 more carefully .",
    "we know that this sum should be over a set of discrete integers : @xmath429 .",
    "an analysis of the structure of the hypergeometric function in ( [ lessgensoln ] ) for large @xmath376 shows that this will only be so if @xmath413 is equal to an integer which is zero or negative : @xmath430",
    ". we can understand this condition by recalling  @xcite that the function @xmath431 is a polynomial of degree @xmath432 ( where @xmath432 is a non - negative integer ) in @xmath100 if @xmath433 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath434 , then @xmath314 in ( [ lessgensoln ] ) must be a polynomial of degree @xmath432 in @xmath435 , i.e. @xmath436 must be a polynomial of degree @xmath437 in @xmath435 , as required .    from ( [ tildes ] ) , @xmath438 $ ] , so if @xmath439 , then @xmath440 $ ] . similarly , @xmath441 = \\sqrt{[1 - \\lambda^{*}s]^{2 }",
    "+ 4\\lambda}$ ] .",
    "a short calculation then gives @xmath442 , where @xmath443 .",
    "since we require @xmath422 in the sum in ( [ lessgensoln ] ) , then @xmath444 .",
    "so , in summary , @xmath445 where @xmath446 rather than @xmath432 , it is preferable to use @xmath447 to label the time - dependent solutions .",
    "then ( [ lessgensoln ] ) becomes @xmath448 where we have written @xmath449 as @xmath361 for convenience .",
    "we note that if there were a @xmath362 term in the sum , it would equal @xmath450 which in turn equals  @xcite @xmath451 @xmath452 which equals @xmath453 , using ( [ ps(n)_gamma ] ) . therefore ( [ discreteform1 ] ) may be written in the alternative form @xmath454 where @xmath455 .",
    "it is also possible to write the function @xmath314 in ( [ discreteform2 ] ) as a jacobi polynomial of order @xmath456  @xcite .",
    "the final step is to apply the initial condition given in ( [ conds_f ] ) to ( [ discreteform2 ] ) in order to determine the sets of constants @xmath333 .",
    "this leads to @xmath457 to solve ( [ initialcond ] ) , let us write the hypergeometric function as @xmath458 where the symbol @xmath459 means @xmath460 .",
    "then rearranging the double sum gives @xmath461 where @xmath462 .",
    "however , it is straightforward to determine the @xmath463 : by expanding @xmath464)^{m}$ ] in powers of @xmath435 we find that @xmath465 vanishes for @xmath466 and is proportional to a binomial coefficient for @xmath467 . using this result and writing out @xmath468 fully yields @xmath469    we now turn to the problem of finding @xmath65 , which involves identifying the the coefficient of @xmath345 in ( [ discreteform2 ] ) .",
    "let us begin by considering @xmath470 . by following exactly the same steps that lead to ( [ kequalszero ] ) in the @xmath362 case , but this time for general @xmath339 , we find that this function equals @xmath471 @xmath472 therefore , we may write the solution for @xmath473 , eqn .",
    "( [ discreteform2 ] ) , as @xmath474 where @xmath475 to identify powers of @xmath376 in ( [ double_sum ] )",
    "we break it down further : @xmath476 writing @xmath477 we have from ( [ triple_sum ] ) @xmath478 so to find @xmath65 we have to determine @xmath479 , which is the coefficient of @xmath345 in ( [ def_chi ] ) . if we denote @xmath480 by @xmath481 and @xmath482 by @xmath483 , this is like asking : what is the coefficient of @xmath345 in @xmath484 \\left [ b_{0 } + b_{1}z + \\ldots + b_{n - k}z^{n - k } \\right]\\ , ? \\ ] ] the answer is : @xmath485 going back to the variables relevant to the problem under consideration , @xmath486 the complicated limits on the sum can be relaxed with a suitable interpretation of the binomial coefficient @xmath487 .",
    "for instance , @xmath488)}{(n - r)\\,!\\ ,   \\gamma(-k)}\\ , .\\ ] ] if @xmath489 , both the numerator and the denominator on the right - hand - side diverge in such a way that the ratio is finite and non - zero and is commonly written as the left - hand - side . if @xmath490 , then only the denominator diverges and the right - hand - side is zero . with this understanding , the lower condition on the sum in ( [ chi ] ) can simply be replaced by @xmath491 , since there is no contribution if @xmath490 , that is , if @xmath492 .",
    "a similar interpretation of the binomial coefficient in @xmath482 can be used to remove the upper condition on the sum .",
    "the result ( [ chi ] ) , together with the definition of @xmath482 , determine the @xmath65 given by ( [ ftop ] ) .",
