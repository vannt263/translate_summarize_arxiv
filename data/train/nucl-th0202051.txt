    "as one of the very interesting first results , rhic experiments have established a significant suppression of moderately high @xmath1 hadrons produced in central a+a collisions compared to rescaled peripheral collisions or rescaled ( and extrapolated ) p+p collisions @xcite .",
    "the results are a clear hint for nuclear medium effect(s ) at work .",
    "the most popular explanation is the onset of the occurrence of so called ` jet quenching ' @xcite .",
    "it is the idea that a high energetic parton moving through a color dense ( and then deconfined ) medium will lose considerable energy most dominantly by gluon radiation , and so its final fragmentation will give rise to a leading hadron with considerable lower energy .",
    "a recent and much involved calculation based on the glv formalism for a finite number of colored collisions ( and including the cronin effect as well as a slight modification of the gluon distribution due to shadowing ) provide a good agreement with the data . still , though , a phenomenological opacity parameter has to be adjusted @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that simple incoherent scattering in the further partonic evolution of the fireball should be of relevance @xcite .",
    "contrary , also the proposal was made that the observed spectra for central collisions show a significant @xmath3 scaling being a manifestation of a direct remnant of the initial gluons which were liberated from gluon saturated nuclear distribution functions @xcite . here ,",
    "any possible final state interactions which might or should alter the distributions are completly discarded .",
    "a major concern , and which lead to the present study , is that it is typically assumed in all these descriptions that the partons somehow exits the collision region before finally fragmenting into a ` jet ' of hadrons .",
    "the potential magnitude of the hadronization time ( or , to be more precise , the time to build up the hadronic wavefunction ) is based on a relativistic and simple quantum mechanical estimate for ( a ) light or ( b ) heavy quarks @xcite @xmath4 taking ( a ) with the average radius of the pion @xmath5 fm or ( b ) substituting @xmath6 by @xmath7 for a @xmath8-meson and taking @xmath9 fm , one has for the formation time a crude understanding given as @xmath10 hence , for leading hadrons with moderately high @xmath11 original point - like jet - partons have established already a complete nonperturbative , transversal wavefunction after traveling a distance in length of smaller or equal than 10 fm . accordingly , the jets should , to a large fraction , materialize into hadrons still inside the expanding fireball , which has a transversal size of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the local proper time of the expanding system .",
    "the state becoming the leading hadron will interact as a ( pre-)meson with the surrounding low momentum mesons with a cross section of roughly @xmath14 as long as it is not completely being build up @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the total cross section of two mesons .",
    "the density of hadrons in the late fireball changes from about @xmath16 @xmath17 to @xmath18 @xmath17 .",
    "the mean free path of the fast hadron is then estimated to be @xmath19 fm , meaning a few collisions @xmath20 .",
    "the system is potentially rather opaque !    looking at the available energy for an individual collision ( compare fig .  1 )",
    ", even for a value of @xmath21 , one gets a @xmath22 , if the target is a pion at rest , and only with a @xmath8 as target , one has an invariant mass of above 2.5 for particles with a transverse momentum larger than 3 .     +    hence , for the considered transverse momentum region , one has either elastic scattering , resonance scattering or also inelastic scattering resulting in a few final hadrons . in the following",
    "we treat the collision with the fritiof monte - carlo scheme with a @xmath8-meson as characteristic target hadron being at rest . to also stress some model dependence",
    ", we later compare with elastic scattering on either a @xmath8 or a @xmath23 as target particles , where the scattering is taken simply as isotropic @xcite .",
    "the energy loss for one single interaction of a leading hadron _",
    "i _ with momentum @xmath24 on a low transverse momentum target ( taken as @xmath25 , and both hadrons being located at the same space - time rapidity and momentum rapidity in a bjorken - type picture ) , going into a hadron _",
    "j _ with ( lower ) momentum @xmath2 can be written as @xmath26 while @xmath27 is the initial distribution , @xmath28 is a folding matrix and @xmath29 is the resulting distribution .",
    "stand for the particles @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the folding matrix @xmath40 depends on the model employed for the collision ( for further details we refer to @xcite ) .      for the initial distribution @xmath41 of individual hadrons @xmath42 at moderately high @xmath1",
    "when entering the final hadronic stage we have no direct information . all various ideas ,",
    "as mentioned at the beginning , might contribute and already steepen the spectrum . in order to see the possible effect of the late hadronic interactions , we use individual distributions generated by pythia v6.2 @xcite .",
    "the parameters were first adjusted to ua1-results of @xmath43-collisions .",
    "isospin averaged n - n - collision were then calculated ( for details we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "with the appropriate scaling of binary collisions ( @xmath44 for 80  92% , 12.6 for 60  80% and 945 for 0  5% centrality ) , the calculations are in perfect agreement with the preliminary phenix data for charged hadrons and for neutral pions in the case of peripheral collisions , as can be seen from figs  2 and 3 .",
    "moreover , one can see a dramatic effect when employing on average one single final inelastic collision modelled via the fritiof scheme . in case of the charged hadrons ,",
    "one single collision already would slightly overestimate the suppression . on the other hand",
    "one collision is just right to perfectly explain quantitatively the modification of the momentum distribution of the @xmath45 !",
    "( we have only shown the modifications for @xmath46 gev , as the spectrum below should be dominated by soft physics and hydrodynamical expansion . )      hence , any potential energy loss by final state hadronic reactions is in the same range as considered for the jets in deconfined matter . in fig .",
    "4 we show calculations for various number of collisions now at a @xmath47 gev up to @xmath48 gev .",
    "the three employed models ( for treating the collisions ) do give more or less similar predictions .",
    "the spectrum steepens considerably for a larger effective opacity @xmath49 . on the other hand at some stage the complete evolution of all hadronic particles has to be incorporated to see in full detail the dynamical interplay among ` soft ' and ` hard ' hadrons . the spectrum can not become more steepen than exponential as then the system has thermalized also in the high @xmath1 hadronic degrees of freedom .    in summary",
    ", we have motivated that ( pre-)hadrons stemming from a jet should still materialize in the dense system for momenta up to 10 gev .",
    "the late hadronic interactions have a clear and nonvanishing effect in suppressing the spectrum . on the average one single such interaction",
    "should already be enough to explain quantitatively the rhic results .",
    "our finding , however , signals a warning which has to be addressed in future studies very accurately . ` _ omnes viae romam ducunt _ ' : various different roads at present can account for the possible explanation of the modification in the spectra for central collisions .",
    "deductions for possible qcd effects of a deconfined qgp phase on the materializing jets have to disentangle from the here investigated final state interactions , before definite conclusions on the importance of a potential dense partonic phase , or any other effect , can quantitatively be drawn ."
