    "measurements of parton distributions for members of the baryon octet would give us complementary information to that obtained from the nucleon and could shed light on many phenomena involving non - perturbative qcd , such as @xmath4 symmetry breaking , the flavor asymmetry in the nucleon sea and so on .",

    "_ @xcite that the mechanism responsible for the splitting of the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath3 masses could lead to considerable @xmath4 symmetry breaking in the parton distributions among members of the baryon octet . here , we show explicitly that this is indeed the case by calculating the quark distribution of baryons in the mit bag model , where we include the hyperfine interaction which leads to the splitting of the baryon masses . the @xmath4 breaking which we find goes beyond the implicit breaking of @xmath4 by the strange quark mass , since it leads to deviations from @xmath4 expectations even among baryons with the same number of strange ( valence ) quarks . we also investigate the influence of the meson cloud on the shape of the `` bare '' quark distributions and calculate the flavor asymmetries in the sea arising from the meson - baryon fluctuations .",

    "since the hyperfine interaction responsible for the splitting of the @xmath0-@xmath1 masses also splits the masses of scalar and vector diquarks and whether the struck quark is accompanied by a scalar or vector diquark is flavor dependent , this splitting leads to flavor dependent distortions in the shape of the quark distributions compared to exact @xmath5 symmetry . in the case of the nucleons , the @xmath36-quark distribution peaks at larger @xmath34-values than the @xmath37-quark distribution .",

    "it is instructive to review the mass - splitting of the baryons here .",
    "the exact mechanism for this splitting is not essential for the calculation of the quark distribution since only the masses of the scalar and vector diquarks enter the calculation and different mechanisms / explanations lead to similar results .",

    "@xcite , the measured @xmath34-dependence of the fsv , especially that of the ratio @xmath306 ( not shown ) , requires a relatively large contribution from the @xmath307 component in the proton case , which cancels the contributions from the @xmath308 component at large @xmath34 values and leads to the required fast decrease of the asymmetry in this region . since , on the other hand , the magnitude of the @xmath308 and @xmath307 components are restricted by the requirement that their contributions to the total sea quark distributions can not larger than the experimentally measured value , an additional non - chiral component is needed at small @xmath34 .",
    "this non - chiral component may be attributed to the pauli exclusion principle , as suggested by field and feynman @xcite .",
    "because of the pauli exclusion principle , the presence of two valence @xmath36 quarks in the proton , as opposed to a single valence @xmath37 quark , makes it less probable to produce a @xmath309 pair compared to a @xmath310 pair giving an excess of @xmath205 over @xmath206 in the non - perturbative sea . based on bag model calculations @xcite , it is expected that this component should have a shape similar to the usual sea quark distributions , contributing to the asymmetry at lower @xmath34 values than the chiral component .",

    "since the pseudoscalar mesons do not contribute to the spin dependent quark distributions of the baryons , the meson - cloud corrections decrease the amount of the baryon spin carried by the spin of the quarks .",

    "@xmath325 in the @xmath7 comes from lower lying fluctuations and could be sizable .",

    "further , we see that , because of the transverse motion of the quarks , the fraction of the spin carried by the quarks in the bag model is smaller than one . in conclusion ,",

    "the predictions for @xmath328 and @xmath329 are similar , with @xmath328 peaking at slightly lower @xmath34-values than @xmath329 .",
    "this is because the @xmath36 quarks , which have a somewhat softer distribution in the @xmath7 than in the proton , dominate in @xmath245 .    in concluding this section",
    "we must issue a caution concerning the discussion of spin - dependent parton distributions here .",
    "it is by now well understood that the axial anomaly plays a vital role in the flavor singlet spin structure @xcite and the model which we have used has not incorporated such effects . as a result the integral of @xmath329 , for example",
    ", satisfies the ellis - jaffe sum rule  with the octet and isovector axial charges appropriate to the model , including meson corrections .",
    "it is therefore not too surprising that our curves for @xmath329 lie above the data .",
    "a reasonable polarized gluon distribution could bring the calculated values in table . 1 into better agreement with the experimental value of @xmath8 .",
    "we calculated the quark distribution functions of different hyperons in the mit bag model using the approach of the adelaide group which assures the correct support of the distribution functions .",
    "the hyperfine splitting responsible for the splitting of the masses of the @xmath1-@xmath0 , @xmath3-@xmath2 and @xmath8-@xmath180 results in quark distributions very different from @xmath5 expectations .",
    "this @xmath5 breaking goes beyond the explicit breaking through the strange quark mass and leads to different shapes of the quark distributions , even in hyperons with the same number of ( valence ) strange quarks . the strange to u ratio in the @xmath7 increases with @xmath125  a behaviour opposite to that predicted by @xmath4 .",
    "further , we predict polarized @xmath36 and @xmath37 quarks distributions in the @xmath3 as a function of @xmath34 , even though their net contributions to the total spin of the @xmath3 are zero . this prediction could be tested in semi - inclusive polarized dis since",
    "the coupling of the @xmath36 quarks to the electromagnetic current is four times larger than that of the strange quarks .",
    "we also calculated the modifications of the bare quark distributions through the meson - cloud required by chiral symmetry .",
    "although the meson - cloud corrections to the distributions in the @xmath7 are not as large as those to the corresponding distributions in the proton , because of the smaller coupling constants , the meson - cloud also leads to significant flavor symmetry violations in the sea quark distribution of the hyperons .",
    "we found that the @xmath205 in the @xmath7 is enhanced relative to the @xmath206 , contrary to @xmath4 expectations .",
    "the @xmath330 ratio is comparable to the corresponding ratio @xmath331 in the proton since , in the @xmath7 case , all of the lowest lying fluctuations enhance the @xmath205 relative to @xmath206 .",
