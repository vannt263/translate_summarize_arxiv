    "since the first observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in 1995 for alkali atomic vapors of @xmath0rb and @xmath1na atoms both theoretical and experimental research has accelerated to study this newly discovered macroscopic quantum phenomenon , where a fraction of these bosons occupies the same quantum mechanical ground state . achieving bec in experiment for alkali atoms was only possible due to the discovery of efficient cooling and trapping techniques which became available by the end of the twentieth century @xcite . with more cooling advances ,",
    "research interest has not only increased in the field of ultra - cold quantum gases with isotropic short - range contact interaction , which represents the effective interaction between atoms and is dominated by the s - wave scattering length . also the anisotropic long - range dipole - dipole interaction has been made accessible to detailed study by the formation of a bec in a dipolar quantum gas of @xmath2cr atoms @xcite .",
    "further atomic becs with magnetic dipole - dipole interaction followed soon with @xmath3dy @xcite and @xmath4er @xcite atoms .",
    "strong electric dipole - dipole interactions were realized by a stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) experiment , which allowed the creation of @xmath5k @xmath0rb molecules in the rovibrational ground state @xcite .",
    "the research field of ultra - cold quantum gases allows today to analyze many condensed matter problems in the spirit of feynman s quantum simulator @xcite , as all ingredients of the quantum many - body hamiltonian can be experimentally tuned with an unprecedented precision",
    ". the kinetic energy can be controlled with spin - orbit coupling @xcite , the potential energy can be harmonic @xcite box - like @xcite or even anharmonic @xcite and also the strength of contact as well as dipolar interaction are tunable @xcite .",
    "in addition , in order to make quantum gas simulators even more realistic , various experimental and theoretical methods for controlling the effect of disorder have been designed .",
    "using superfluid helium in vycor glass , which represents some kind of porous media , the random distribution of pores represents a random environment @xcite .",
    "laser speckles are produced by focusing the laser beam on a glass plate , where the resulting random interference pattern is reflected to a bec cell @xcite .",
    "wire traps represent magnetic traps on atomic chips where the roughness and the imperfection of the wire surface generates a disorder potential @xcite .",
    "another possibility to create a random potential is to trap one species of atoms randomly in a deep optical lattice , which serves as frozen scatterers for a second atomic species @xcite .",
    "in addition also , incommensurable lattices provide a useful random environment @xcite .    in order to study the properties of interacting bosons in such a random potential huang and meng proposed a bogoliubov theory , which was applied to the case of superfluid helium in porous media @xcite , and extended later by others @xcite . for a delta - correlated disorder",
    "it was found that both a condensate and a superfluid depletion occurs due to the localization of bosons in the respective minima of the external random potential which is present even at zero temperature . a generalization to the corresponding situation , where the disorder correlation function falls off with a characteristic correlation length as , for instance , a gauss function @xcite , laser speckles @xcite or a lorentzian @xcite is straightforward .    in this paper",
    "we extend the bogoliubov theory of huang and meng @xcite to a dipolar bose gas at finite temperature . with this",
    "we go beyond the zero - temperature mean - field approach where the gross - pitaevskii equation is solved perturbativly with respect to the random potential @xcite .",
    "this extension to the finite - temperature regime allows us to study in detail how the anisotropy of superfluidity can be tuned , a phenomenon which also occurs at zero - temperature @xcite , but turns out to be enhanced by the thermal fluctuations .",
    "we observe in addition that contact and dipolar interaction have different effects upon quantum , thermal , and disorder depletion of condensate and superfluid .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section .",
    "ii we revisit the bogoliubov theory of the homogeneous dirty boson problem . with this",
    ", we determine for a general two - particle interaction and a general disorder correlation for different observables the beyond mean - field corrections which stem from quantum , thermal , and disorder fluctuations . in section .",
    "iii we specialize our treatment for a dipolar bose gas and a delta - correlated disorder in the zero - temperature and the thermodynamic limit . in particular , we investigate the particle and condensate density as well as the inner energy . in section .",
    "iv we extend the bogoliubov theory in order to derive the superfluid depletion which turns out to be only due to the external random potential and the thermal excitation . in section .",
    "v we consider how finite - temperature effects on the condensate depletion as well as the normal fluid component depend on the respective strength of contact and dipolar interaction .",
    "a three - dimensional ultra - cold dipolar bose gas in a weak random potential is modeled by the grand - canonical hamiltonian @xmath6\\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x})\\label{eq:1}\\\\   & + \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^{3}\\mathbf{x}\\int d^{3}\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{x})\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{x^{\\prime}})v(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x^{\\prime}})\\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x^{\\prime}})\\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}),\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the usual field operators for bose particles of mass @xmath9 , which satisfy the following commutation relations    @xmath10= & \\delta(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x^{\\prime}}),\\nonumber \\\\ \\bigl[\\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}),\\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x^{\\prime}})\\bigr]= & \\bigl[\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{x}),\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{x^{\\prime}})\\bigr]=0.\\label{eq:10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath11 denotes the chemical potential and @xmath12 represents the random potential . irrespective of the physical origin of the disorder potential , we assume that the average over the random potential vanishes and that it has some kind of correlation i.e. @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the two - particle interaction potential for a dipolar bose gas consists of two different parts : @xmath15 . on the one hand",
    "the short - range isotropic contact interaction is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents its strength with the s - wave scattering length @xmath18 .",
    "from now on we assume a positive @xmath18 , i.e. a repulsive contact interaction , which depletes the particles from the ground state due to quantum and thermal fluctuations and also forbids them from being localized in the minima of the external random potential @xmath12 .",
    "thus , unlike the case of free fermions , where pauli blocking prevents the particles from localizing in a single orbital , bosons require a repulsive interaction to prevent them from collapsing into the respective minima of the external random potential . on the other hand",
    "the long - range anisotropic polarized dipolar part is written in real space for dipoles aligned along @xmath19-axis direction according to @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the dipolar interaction strength due to magnetic or electric dipole moments . in the first case we have @xmath22 , with the magnetic dipole moment @xmath23 and the magnetic permeability of vacuum @xmath24 , and in the latter case we have @xmath25 , with the electric dipole moment @xmath26 and the vacuum dielectric constant @xmath27 .",
    "note that , due to the anisotropic character of the dipolar interaction , many static and dynamic properties of a dipolar bose gas become tunable @xcite , consequences for a random environment have only recently be explored @xcite .    with the help of a fourier transformation we can rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) in momentum space according to @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the volume and the interaction potential in momentum space is given by @xcite    @xmath30    here @xmath31 denotes the angle between the polarization direction , which is here along the @xmath19-axis , and the wave vector @xmath32 .",
    "note that ( [ eq:92 ] ) is not continuous at @xmath33 , as the limit @xmath34 is direction dependent .",

    "by doing so , we perform the following two physical approximations . at first , we ignore terms which contain creation and annihilation operators of the excited states @xmath46 , which are of third and fourth order , as they represent higher - order interactions of the particles out of the condensate .",
    "such an approximation is justified in the case of weakly interacting systems .",
    "secondly , we assume for weak enough disorder that disorder fluctuations decouple in lowest order .",
    "therefore , we ignore the terms @xmath47 with both @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",
    "note that these two physical approximations imply that the excited states are only rarely occupied , i.e. @xmath49 . with this",
    "we get the simplified hamiltonian    @xmath50    here the prime over the summation symbol indicates that the ground state @xmath44 is excluded .",
    "the appearance of off - diagonal terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath46 in equation ( [ eq:62 - 1 ] ) indicates that the state @xmath44 is no longer the ground state of the interacting system . in order to determine this new mean - field ground state we have to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ eq:62 - 1 ] ) . to this end",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and use the inhomogeneous bogoliubov transformation    @xmath53    note that the bogoliubov amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be chosen to be real without loss of generality .",
