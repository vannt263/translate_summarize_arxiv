    "the interest of quantum many - body theory in inhomogeneous superfluid @xmath0he has been active for many years and continuously enriched by the achievement of new experimental realizations of confining geometries .",
    "@xcite the most classical , and consequently best known , correspond to @xmath0he films adsorbed on different substrates  @xcite and to @xmath0he clusters produced by free jet expansions through very thin nozzles .",
    "@xcite more recently , and still with some open questions , interest has been devoted to @xmath0he in porous media such as vycor or aerogel  @xcite and @xmath0he adsorbed in carbon nanotube bundles  @xcite forming quasi - one dimensional structures . in common with other fluids currently under study ,",
    "the effects of a confined geometry upon its microscopic properties are most interesting .",
    "additionally , liquid @xmath0he poses an unavoidable quantum behavior which manifests in its own existence as a liquid even at zero temperature , with a superfluid phase and a partially occupied bose - einstein state .",
    "moreover , its extreme purity allows for a much cleaner extraction of data which is usually impossible with other liquids .",
    "one of the fundamental features raised by the inhomogeneous situations described above is the emergence of the free surface of superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "@xcite for a long time , the main concern has been to understand how distinctive properties of this quantum liquid , like its superfluid density and condensate fraction , behave when the density goes to zero through a free surface .",
    "@xcite also the surface tension , the form of its density profile , the value of the surface width , and the role of the surface excitations in its dynamics have been theoretically and experimentally studied .",
    "@xcite the most direct information on the density profile and interfacial width has been obtained by x - ray reflectivity  @xcite and ellipsometric  @xcite measurements .",
    "the latter was carried out by osborne ,  @xcite who assuming a fermi function for the profile , extracted a 10 - 90 % width of 9.4   at 1.8 k. the most recent data correspond to the x - ray measurement of penanen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite who reported a value 6.5   at 0.45 k , a lower temperature than the first measure performed by lurio _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite at 1.13 k who reported a wider surface of 9.1  .",
    "the relative spread of the experimental results on the microscopic characteristics of the density profile points out the difficulties which experimental setups face to carry out a clean extraction of the data and its reduction to the ground state , i.e. , to zero temperature .",
    "the difficulty of the experimental work on the study of the @xmath0he free surface is also reflected in the long - time effort to measure accurately the surface tension . since the first work by urk _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in 1925 , the number of groups and different techniques used for this measure is unusually large .",
    "recent data starts with iino _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who measured the surface tension using the surface - wave resonance method obtaining an estimation at zero temperature of @xmath1 k@xmath2 .",
    "later on , roche _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained a slightly larger value @xmath3 k@xmath2 from the frequencies of capillary waves with wavelength in the micron range . in this second work ,",
    "the difference in the values obtained for @xmath4 is imputed to a possible inaccuracy in the work of iino _ et al . _",
    "@xcite related to the treatment of the meniscus at the edge of the box . however , this argument was refuted posteriorly by nakanishi and suzuki  @xcite who confirmed the result obtained in ref . .",
    "recently , vicente _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a new measure of the surface tension using the vibration modes of levitated @xmath0he drops , and the result was in perfect agreement with the larger value obtained by roche _",
    "et al._.  @xcite    the surface tension , surface width , and density profile of the free @xmath0he surface have been calculated using both density functional  @xcite and microscopic theory .",
    "@xcite density functional theory relies on functional forms of the energy which depend on the one - body density and some parameters which are adjusted to reproduce selected experimental data .",
    "these functionals have been progressively improved by the inclusion of non - local contributions and specific terms to reproduce the experimental static response function .",
    "@xcite contrarily to the first models , in which the surface tension was considered an input to fix parameters , the most modern ones are able to give predictions for @xmath4 .",
    "the results for the surface tension are in an overall agreement with the experimental data from ref . ,",
    "and the surface width is @xmath5  .",
    "the methodology of microscopic approaches is different since the starting point in all of them is the hamiltonian of the liquid containing realistic interparticle interactions . in this respect ,",
    "the variational method has been specially useful due to the hard - core of the he - he interaction . in fact , the most extensive work in the field of inhomogeneous @xmath0he has been carried out in the variational framework of the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) and correlated basis function ( cbf ) theories . of special relevance in this field",
    "is the continued work by krotscheck and co - workers ,  @xcite who have carried out a nearly exhaustive study of @xmath0he in reduced geometries both for the ground and the excited states .",
    "quantum monte carlo methods  @xcite have also been applied to the study of the free surface of liquid @xmath0he . using a slab geometry , valls and schmidt",
    "@xcite calculated the ground - state properties of the surface by means of the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method with a trial wave function containing two- and three - body correlations .",
    "they extracted a surface tension @xmath6 k@xmath2 ( again very close to data from ref . ) from an analytical fit to the dependence of the energy with the inverse of the surface density .",
    "galli and reatto  @xcite studied a @xmath0he slab using a shadow wavefunction and the vmc method ; they obtained @xmath7 k@xmath2 and a surface thickness @xmath8  .",
    "the variational constraints can be removed by applying the essentially exact diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) methods . at present",
    ", the only application of these methods to a slab corresponds to a gfmc calculation by valls and schmidt  @xcite who estimated a surface tension of 0.265 k@xmath2 and a small value for the width ( @xmath9  ) probably due to the small number of particles used in the simulation .",
    "recently , draeger and ceperley  @xcite carried out a similar study but at finite temperature using the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) method .",
    "this work does not contain results for @xmath4 and surface width since its main motivation was the study of the enhancement of the bose - einstein condensate fraction at the surface .    in the last years",
    ", a renewed interest in the study of the @xmath0he surface has emerged since the first theoretical observation by lewart _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite of a large increase of the condensed fraction near the surface of @xmath0he drops .",
    "the relevance of this result in the long way for searching a bose - einstein condensed state was put forward by griffin and stringari  @xcite who studied the low density surface using a generalized gross - pitaevskii equation . a subsequent work by galli and reatto ,",
    "@xcite using the vmc method with a trial wave function based on the shadow model , pointed out that the introduction of fluctuations on the surface , mainly the zero point motion of ripplons , can reduce significantly the enhancement of @xmath10 .",
    "their results show an increase of @xmath10 up to a maximum value @xmath11 and a decrease to zero when the density @xmath12 approaches zero . in order to shed light on these two different predictions , draeger and ceperley  @xcite calculated @xmath10 in a @xmath0he slab using pimc .",
    "their results show also a clear enhancement of the condensate fraction up to values larger than @xmath13 and a small decrease when approaching the outer part of the surface .",
    "therefore , fluctuations can arise and reduce @xmath10 but their effects could be significantly smaller than in the vmc calculation of ref . .",
    "a conclusive statement would require from a direct experimental measure which , for example , in the bulk has not yet been possible .",
    "nevertheless , at present there are two experiments that seem to confirm the increase of @xmath10 .",
    "the first one was derived from a quantum evaporation experiment ,  @xcite and the second and more recent , form deep - inelastic neutron - scattering on thick layers of @xmath0he on an mgo substrate .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , we present a dmc calculation of the ground - state properties of a free @xmath0he surface at zero temperature .",
    "to some extent , our work represents an update of the gfmc calculation of valls and schmidt  @xcite in the sense of considering a more accurate interatomic potential and a larger number of particles in the simulation to achieve thicker slabs and therefore a more realistic study of the surface .",
    "moreover , we have included in the present study topics like the density profile form , two - body distribution functions and structure factors , and mainly the study of the one - body density matrix which were not analyzed in ref . .",
    "the exact character of the dmc method , within the statistical noise , allows for an accurate study of all the surface properties without the bounds imposed by a variational treatment .",
    "the methodology used in the analysis is , regarding the main inputs , the same that we have used previously in the study of bulk liquid @xmath0he and @xmath14he , and that has shown an overall agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "@xcite    our paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the dmc method which works with a second - order approximation for the short - time green function .",
    "the specific details of the simulation for the slab geometry are also discussed , with special emphasis on the requirements for the trial wave function used for importance sampling .",
    "the results obtained , for both structure and energetics of the slab , are presented in section iii .",
    "finally , section iv comprises additional discussion on the results and the main conclusions .",
    "the dmc method is nowadays a well established tool for solving the many - body imaginary - time schrdinger equation , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a @xmath17-dimensional vector ( _ walker _ ) and @xmath18 is the imaginary time measured in units of @xmath19 .",
    "the time - dependent wave function of the system @xmath20 can be expanded in terms of a complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath21 of the hamiltonian , @xmath22\\ , \\phi_i({\\bf r})\\ , \\label{dmc.eq1b}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the eigenvalue associated to @xmath21 .",

    "an efficient solution of eq .",
    "( [ dmc.eq1 ] ) requires from the use of importance sampling .",
    "it is introduced by solving the schrdinger equation for the wave function @xmath28 @xmath29 being a time - independent trial wave function able to describe the system at a variational level . introducing the hamiltonian of the system @xmath30 eq .

    "( [ dmc.eq4 ] ) may be written as the action of three operators @xmath35 acting on the wave function @xmath36 , @xmath37 the first one , @xmath38 , corresponds to a free diffusion with a a diffusion coefficient @xmath39 ; @xmath40 acts as a driving force due to an external potential , and finally @xmath41 looks like a birth / death term .",
    "equation ( [ dmc.eq4p ] ) is transformed to the integral form @xmath42 by introducing the green function @xmath43 with @xmath44 .    in the dmc method ,",
    "( [ dmc.eq7 ] ) is iterated repeatedly until to reach the asymptotic regime @xmath45 , a limit in which one is effectively sampling the ground state . in our implementation of the method we use a second - order expansion ( quadratic dmc ) ,  @xcite @xmath46 which has proved to be a good compromise between algorithmic complexity and efficiency .    the study of the free surface is made by simulating a slab which grows symmetrically in the @xmath47 direction and with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath48 plane .",
    "the slab geometry is probably the best suited one to analyze the free surface since it does not present neither the substrate influence of films nor the curvature effects of drops .",
    "it is also true that the existence of two surfaces can introduce some residual influence between them .",
    "however , we have checked in our simulations that this effect , at least for the larger slabs , is completely negligible .",
    "the implementation of dmc requires of a model for the trial wave function @xmath29 with the basic physical features of the system under study . in the present case ,",
    "one _ a priori _ knows that @xmath29 becomes zero in two situations : when two atoms get closer than the core of its interaction , and when an atom tries to escape from the surface .",
    "notice that at zero temperature no vapor is present out of the liquid .",
    "having in mind these arguments , we consider @xmath49 with a jastrow correlation factor accounting for dynamical correlations @xmath50 and a confining term , factorized in the form @xmath51 the two - body correlation function is the same we used in the study of the bulk liquid .",

    "( [ trial5 ] ) .",
    "the properties of the free surface of liquid @xmath0he have been studied by performing dmc calculations with an increasing number of particles @xmath58=54 , 108 , 162 , 216 , 324 , and a fixed @xmath48 area of @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the interatomic potential is the hfd - b(he ) model proposed by aziz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that has proven its high accuracy in previous dmc calculations of the density dependence of the pressure and speed of sound in bulk @xmath0he and @xmath14he liquids .",
    "@xcite as a matter of comparison with the gfmc calculation of valls and schmidt ,  @xcite and in order to establish the influence of the potential in the surface properties , we have calculated the energy of the system and the surface tension using the hfdhe2 model , also proposed by aziz and collaborators .",
    "@xcite    in order to take into account size effects , due to the finite value of the simulation area @xmath61 and periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath48 plane , we have added to the energy tail corrections which are externally calculated assuming that the particles are uncorrelated for distances in this plane larger than half of the simulation square .",
    "the analytical expressions for the tails are reported in ref . .",
    "applying this analysis , we have verified that the energy per particle when doubling simultaneously @xmath61 and @xmath58 does not change within the current statistical noise .",
    "possible bias in the dmc calculations coming from the time step and the mean population of walkers are also under control working , in both cases , with values which are well in the asymptotic regime .    a final key point of a dmc simulation concerns the values of the parameters in the trial wave function ( [ trial4],[trial5 ] ) .",
