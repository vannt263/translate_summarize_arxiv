    "currently , 12 bright x - ray sources are known in 12 different globular clusters .",
    "presumably they are all low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) but orbital periods have so far been determined for only four of them ( ngc  6441 , ngc  6624 , ngc  6712 and ngc  7078 ) . these four periods range between 0.19  hr ( for ngc  6624 , stella et al .",
    "1987 ) and 17.10  hr ( for ngc  7078 , ilovaisky et al .",
    "an interesting characteristic of these is that a high percentage ( 11 out of 12 ) exhibit type - i x - ray bursts which are thought to originate on the surfaces of neutron stars . for the bright lmxbs in the galactic plane",
    "this is only @xmath330% .",
    "this paper deals with the sole bright x - ray source in a globular cluster that has so far not exhibited bursts , namely in terzan 6 .",
    "terzan 6 ( terzan 1968 ) is a metal - rich globular cluster at a distance of 7  kpc and highly reddened , with e(b - v)=2.24 ( barbuy et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the cluster has undergone core collapse , its core and tidal radii are 3.3  and 316 respectively ( trager et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the transient x - ray source  was first detected in early september , 1990 , both with the x - ray telescope art - p on _ granat _ ( pavlinsky et al .",
    "1994 ) and with rosat ( predehl et al .",
    "the art - p spectrum was compatible with 5.8  kev thermal bremsstrahlung and absorption by cold gas of cosmic abundances with @xmath4  @xmath5 .",

    "this is 0.9 core radii from the center of terzan 6 as published by barbuy et al .",
    "furthermore , this rosat measurement is compatible with the hard bremsstrahlung spectrum of 5.8  kev , but the absorption column is rather lower at @xmath12  @xmath5 ( verbunt et al .",
    "we have re - analyzed this spectrum , and find that a higher column , more in line with what was found from art - p data , is not acceptable .",

    "however , terzan 6 was not observed with either the sensitive x - ray instruments on _ einstein _ or exosat .",
    "rappaport et al . (",
    "1994 ) observed terzan 6 with the hri on rosat on march 16 - 17 , 1992 , and found no source within 10 core radii .",
    "thus , they confirmed that the source is a transient .",
    "their hri upper limit extrapolates to a pspc upper limit which is a factor of 150 lower than the pspc detection in september 1990 ( verbunt et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in this paper",
    "five new x - ray data sets are discussed which were obtained since 1996 .",
    "the nature of the data is twofold .",
    "monitoring observations were obtained with the wide field cameras ( wfcs ) on _ bepposax _ between august 1996 and april 1999 , and with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on _ rossixte _ since february 1999 .",
    "sensitive target - of - opportunity observations ( toos ) were carried out with the narrow - field instruments ( nfi ) on _ bepposax _ in september 1998 and with the pca in september 1998 and in june 1999 .",
    "we present an analysis of all these observations and speculate on the nature of the source .",
    "the wfcs ( jager et al . 1997 ) on the _ bepposax _ satellite ( boella et al .",
    "1997a ) carry out a long - term program of monitoring observations of the 40@xmath13 field around the galactic center .",
    "one of the goals is to detect x - ray transient activity from lmxbs whose galactic population exhibits a strong concentration in this field ( e.g. , heise 1998 and ubertini et al .",
    "with respect to the monitoring observations with the all - sky monitor on _ rossixte _ the wfc monitoring observations are not as much source confused so close to the galactic center and are five times as sensitive for 1-day time spans .",
    "the program consists of campaigns during the spring and fall of each year .",
    "each campaign lasts about two months and typically comprises weekly observations .",
    "up to mid 1999 , a total net exposure time of 2.6 million seconds was accumulated during 6 campaigns .",
    "terzan 6 is only 26 distant from the direction of the galactic center which is the pointing direction of the monitoring program .",
    "therefore , terzan 6 is observed near to the optimum sensitivity .",
    "[ figwfclc ] presents the light curve .",
    "at least three outbursts are recognized with first detections at mjd  50316 , 50697 and 51047 .",
    "the sampling is far from complete .",
    "there is a gap between mjd  50732 and mjd  50869 during which two dates the source was active .",
    "if the source returned to quiescence in this gap , which seems likely given the durations of other outbursts , we have detected four outbursts .",
    "the incomplete sampling makes it difficult as well to assess the peak flux of each outburst .",
    "the maximum intensity over all accurate detections is about 30 mcrab in the 2 to 26 kev band .",
    "this happens to be quite close to the flux measured with art - p in the 1990 outburst ( pavlinsky et al .",

    "since february 1999 , scanning observations are carried out with the pca on _ rossixte _ of a rectangular region surrounding the galactic center , of approximately 16@xmath1418  in size and on a semi - weekly basis .",
    "in addition to the known persistently bright x - ray sources , of which about 20 are detected , old and new transient sources are found .",
    "the sensitivity of these scan observations is about 1  mcrab over the whole region .",
    "this is one to two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the observations with the all - sky monitor on _",
    "rossixte_. thanks to the high frequency of the observations and the high duty cycle throughout the year ( @xmath15% ) , it is possible to uniformly sample outburst light curves of relatively faint transients .",
    "in contrast , the wfc observations have a lower duty cycle of @xmath16% and an observation frequency at least twice as low .",
    "terzan 6 is covered by all scan observations .",
    "it was found to go into outburst starting may 5 , 1999 , at mjd  51303.97 .",
    "the light curve is presented in fig .",
    "[ figpcalc ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "the observations appear to sample the light curve well , there is no strong variability from data point to data point . therefore , the peak flux can be confidently measured .",
    "the profile is a fast - rise exponential - decay function which is so typical of many other lmxb transients .",
    "the rise time was observed to be shorter than 1 week and could well have been much shorter .",
    "the peak intensity is 350.1@xmath06.5  cts  s@xmath17 per 5  proportional counter units and occurred on mjd  51308.9 , or 34.0@xmath01.1  mcrab ( this includes a systematic uncertainty of 0.9  mcrab for the quiescent level which may be contaminated by diffuse galactic emission ) .",
    "the outburst intensity dropped to below the detection limit somewhere between mjd  51338 and 51343 .",
    "the activity was seen for a 35 day period .",
    "the e - folding decay time is @xmath18  d , if one fits an exponential function to all data beyond and including the time of peak intensity . until mid 1999",
    "this is the only outburst of  seen in about 160 days of pca scan observations .",
    "the other outbursts ( i.e. , measured with wfc and art - p ) have not shown fluxes that are significantly higher than the peak flux measured in this outburst .",
    "the decay time of 18  d is reasonably consistent with the rate of decay of the latter two wfc - detected outbursts .",
    "the situation is unclear for the former two outbursts due to incomplete sampling .    the evolution of the 630 to 26 kev hardness ratio is also presented in fig .  [ figpcalc ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "this shows that the spectrum is significantly harder during the rise than during the decay , and that there is no measurable spectral change during the decay ( there is only a hint of a slight hardening during decay ) .",
    "the nfi include 2 imaging instruments that are sensitive at photon energies below 10  kev : the low - energy and the medium - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs and mecs , see parmar et al . 1997 and boella et al .",
    "1997b , respectively ) .",
    "they have circular fields of view with diameters of 37  and 56  and effective bandpasses of 0.1 - 10.5 and 1.6 - 10.5  kev , respectively .",
    "the other two , non - imaging , nfi instruments are the phoswich detector system ( pds ) which covers @xmath19 to 300 kev ( frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) and the high - pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hp - gspc ) which covers 4 to 120 kev ( manzo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a target - of - opportunity observation ( too ) was performed with the nfi on september 6.26 - 6.79 , 1998 .",
    "the net exposure times are 11.8  ks for lecs , 22.9  ks for mecs , 10.5  ks for hp - gspc and 10.4  ks for pds .",
    "was strongly detected in all instruments .",
    "the lecs and mecs images show only one bright source ( fig .",
    "[ figplaat ] ) , the position as determined from the mecs image is consistent with that from wfc .",
    "we applied extraction radii of 8  and 4  for photons from lecs and mecs images , encircling at least @xmath20% of the power of the instrumental point spread function , to obtain light curves and spectra .",
    "long archival exposures on empty sky fields were used to define the background in the same extraction regions .",
    "these are standard data sets made available especially for the purpose of background determination .",
    "all spectra were rebinned so as to sample the spectral full - width at half - maximum resolution by three bins and to accumulate at least 20 photons per bin .",
    "the latter will ensure the applicability of @xmath21 fitting procedures .",
    "a systematic error of 1% was added to each channel of the rebinned lecs and mecs spectra , to account for residual systematic uncertainties in the detector calibrations ( e.g. , guainazzi et al .",
    "the bandpasses were limited to 0.84.0 kev ( lecs ) , 2.210.5  kev ( mecs ) , 4.025.0 kev ( hp - gspc ) and 15100 kev ( pds ) to avoid photon energies where either the spectral calibration of the instruments is not complete or no flux was measured above the statistical noise . in spectral modeling , an allowance was made to leave free the relative normalization of the spectra from lecs , pds and hp - gspc to that of the mecs spectrum , to accommodate cross - calibration uncertainties in this respect .",
    "publicly available instrument response functions and software were used ( version november 1998 ) .    for the non - imaging pds and hp - gspc , source confusion may be an issue , particularly in the densely populated galactic center field .",
    "we verified whether any other point sources were active inside the field of view ( 11 fwhm for the hp gspc and 13 fwhm for the pds ) .",
    "for these instruments 5 pointings are relevant : one on - source pointing and two off - source pointings per instrument . for our observation ,",
    "the off - source pointings were at + /35 and + /30 from the on - source pointings for the pds and hp gspc respectively ( i.e. , + / in the direction of the satellite positive and negative y - axis ) .",
    "we used near - to - simultaneous wfc images to provide information on what sources were active inside the field of view .",
    "for the on - source pointing , the nearest active point source turned out to be at a distance of 14 .",
    "this is outside the field of view of both instruments .",
    "for the two off - source pointings of the pds , we find that the nearest active source is at 26 .",
    "for the off - source pointings of the hp - gspc , the nearest active source is at 25 .",
    "we conclude that source confusion is no issue in our observation .",
    "[ fignfilc ] shows the light curve in various bandpasses from the four nfi . within the observation",
    ", the source shows a moderate intensity increase of about 10% from beginning to end , and one deep drop starting between 23.4 and 26.2  ks after the start of the observation .",
    "the drop lasts between 2.2 and 5.0  ks . a zoomed - in light curve ( fig .",
    "[ figlczoom ] , including all lecs and mecs data to increase the sensitivity ) shows that the emergence from the drop is not discrete but lasts about 35  s. for the remainder , the drop is flat for over 2200  s. this strongly suggests the drop to be caused by an eclipse by a companion star .",
    "the eclipse is not complete as evidenced by the mecs image accumulated during times of minimum intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ figplaat ] ) . to reliably establish that the faint source is the same as the bright one and to accurately determine the intensity of the faint source , we have carried out a maximum likelihood analysis of the 2.2 - 10.5  kev mecs photons inside and outside the eclipse . in this analysis ,",
    "point sources are searched for on top of a flat background .",
    "it renders quantitative information on the source flux and detection significance ( e.g. , kuiper et al .",
    "the image accumulation times are 26.200 to 28.415  ks after the start of the observation for the eclipse and 0.0 to 23.400 plus 32.380 to 46.780  ks for outside the eclipse . in both images we found evidence for only a single point source .",
    "[ fignfiml ] shows the location confidence contours of these sources .",
    "the best - fit positions are only 4  apart and consistent with each other .",
    "therefore , we reject the possibility that the source during the eclipse is other than outside the eclipse .",

    "this is consistent with what we found following the standard analysis ( i.e. , the rate then is @xmath23  c  s@xmath17 which is @xmath33% lower than the aforementioned value as may be expected to be lost in the wings of the point spread function beyond the 4  accumulation radius ) .",

    "terzan  6 was active during 0.55  ms .",
    "if compared to other lmxbs with relatively faint peak fluxes , the nfi spectrum appears rather soft though not exceptionally so . in terms of @xmath29",
    "as measured with the same nfi instrumentation , it is for instance softer than sax  j1748.9 - 2021 ( 15.5  kev , in t zand et al .",
    "1999a ) , 1e  1724 - 307 ( 27  kev , guainazzi et al . 1998 ) , gs  1826 - 238 ( 14.7  kev , in t zand et al .",
    "on the other hand , 4u  1820 - 30 has a softer spectrum with @xmath30  kev ( guainazzi 1999 ) .",
    "all these sources have periods during which they burst , though possibly not always during the times when nfi spectra was taken .",
    "one wonders why this bright globular cluster x - ray source remains , out of 12 cases , the only one without x - ray bursts .",
    "this relates to the question whether the compact object is a black hole candidate or a neutron star .",
    "if bursts would have been detected , that would have identified for certain a neutron star .",
    "we believe the lack of bursts is a matter of coincidence and does not help to make a statement about the compact object .",
    "to prove this point we tabulate in table  [ tabgcbursters ] the 12 globular clusters that are known to harbor bright x - ray sources , and the number of bursts that were detected from each one with the wfcs .",
    "it is remarkable that , despite the extensive nature of the monitoring campaign of the wfcs and the first - time detection of bursts from two of these , ngc  6652 ( in t zand et al . 1998 ) and ngc 6440 ( in t zand et al .",
    "1999a ) , no bursts were detected from 4 established globular - cluster bursters in the galactic center field and 3 outside that field .",
    "apparently , chances are still high that bursts are missed from established bursters .",
    "we argue that this may very well also apply to terzan 6 .",
    "the five likely outbursts reported in the present paper have wait times of 381 , 172 , 178 , and 256 days .",
    "these numbers are uncertain because , except for the last outburst , our data do not have enough coverage to accurately determine the time of the onsets and to bridge large data gaps due to visibility constraints for wfc observations .",
    "however , one can conclude that there is a hint of a quasi periodicity of 0.5 to 0.7 years .",
    "this is a value not unlike that seen in other lmxbs .",
    "future continued bulge scan observations with the pca will take away data gaps and enable a better measurement of recurrence time , peak flux and decay time and correlations between these .",
    "the shape of the light curve of the last outburst has a fast rise and exponential decay .",
    "this class of outburst profiles is quite ordinary among bright x - ray novae , accounting for about 30% of all cases ( see review by chen et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the decay time constant of 18  d is common as well .",
    "the only difference is the peak flux which is more than an order of magnitude below that of bright x - ray novae .",
    "the low peak flux does not seem to be chance coincidence ( i.e. , some bright recurrent x - ray novae have low - luminosity outbursts as well ) , its magnitude has been similar on five or six different occasions .",
    "the highest peak flux was measured with the pca .",
    "if one assumes that the nfi - measured spectrum applies then ( this is not unreasonable since the nfi observation was close to the peak flux in another outburst ) , the unabsorbed 0.1 - 200  kev peak luminosity is @xmath2  ( for a distance of 7  kpc ) .    despite the high inclination angle",
    ", we failed to detect dipping activity .",
    "however , the lack of dips could be due to the insufficient sensitivity and coverage of the data .",
    "we found  to be an eclipsing lmxb with an orbital period of 12.360@xmath31 hr .",
    "the eclipse duration is 0.72@xmath00.06  hr .",
    "this translates to a lower limit on the inclination angle of 74 , for a compact object mass of at least 1.4  m@xmath32 .",
    "furthermore ,  is a transient source with an unabsorbed 0.1 - 200  kev peak luminosity of @xmath2  and a relatively short recurrence time of half a year .",
    "the short recurrence time provides ample opportunity to study the source in the future .",
    "it is not yet clear what nature the compact object is .",
    "further longer observations are planned of this system in future outbursts to 1 ) search for x - ray bursts to be able to establish the compact object as a neutron star ( the bursts may be weak if only the scattered emission is visible to us ) ; 2 ) diagnose further the residual emission during the eclipse ; 3 ) accurately determine the orbital period through more detailed eclipse timing , which may also enable studies of the orbital period evolution ; 4 ) measure the spectral evolution during an entire outburst to find clues regarding to the faint nature of the source ; and 5 ) search for dips to constrain the inclination angle further .",
