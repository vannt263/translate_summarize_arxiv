    "an _ equilibrium measure _ for the potential @xmath28 is a measure @xmath29 which maximizes @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium measures depend upon the characteristics of the system and the potential .",

    "they represent the lowest energy states , and may reflect the characteristics of the system .",
    "the study of the behavior of the equilibrium measures as @xmath19 is also related to the ergodic optimization ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) : given a continuous dynamical system @xmath52 acting on a compact metric space @xmath53 , and a real - valued function @xmath54 on @xmath53 , one looks for @xmath52-invariant borel probability measures which maximize the integral of @xmath54 .",

    "although this map is similar to our @xmath20 at a first glance , its equilibrium measures converge as @xmath3 to a dirac measure which maximizes the unstable lyapunov exponent .",
    "he also proved the nonexistence of a measure which minimizes the unstable lyapunov exponent .    since there",
    "may exist multiple lyapunov minimizing measures of @xmath20 , it is important to give a criterion for which one is  selected \" in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the next theorem establishes a version of the  entropy criterion \" in @xcite for uniformly hyperbolic systems or the subshift of finite type with hlder continuous potentials .",
