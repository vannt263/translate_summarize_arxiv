    "after the first successful experiment generating photon pairs in the nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion in a nonlinear crystal and demonstration of its unusual temporal and spectral properties more than 30 years ago @xcite , properties of the emitted photon pairs have been addressed in detail in numerous investigations @xcite . the key tool in the theory of photon pairs has become a two - photon spectral amplitude @xcite that describes a photon pair in its full complexity . at the beginning",
    "the effort has been concentrated on two - photon entangled states with anti - correlated signal- and idler - field frequencies that occur in usual nonlinear crystals .",
    "new sources able to generate high photon fluxes have been discovered using , e.g. , periodically - poled nonlinear crystals @xcite , four - wave mixing in nonlinear structured fibers @xcite , nonlinear planar waveguides @xcite or nonlinearities in cavities @xcite",
    ". chirped periodically - poled crystals opened the door for the generation of signal and idler fields with extremely wide spectral bandwidths @xcite .",
    "photon pairs with wide spectral bandwidths can also be generated in specific non - collinear geometries @xcite .",
    "very sharp temporal features are typical for such states that can be successfully applied in metrology ( see @xcite for quantum optical coherence tomography ) . later ,",
    "even two - photon states with coincident frequencies have been revealed .",
    "they can be emitted provided that the extended phase matching conditions ( phase matching of the wave - vectors and group - velocity matching ) are fulfilled @xcite .",
    "also other suitable geometries for the generation of states with coincident frequencies have been found .",
    "nonlinear phase matching for different frequencies at different angles of propagation of the interacting fields can be conveniently used in this case @xcite . or wave - guiding structures with transverse pumping and counter - propagating signal and idler fields can be exploited @xcite .",
    "the last two approaches are quite flexible and allow the generation of states having two - photon amplitudes with an arbitrary orientation of main axes of their ( approximately ) gaussian shape .",
    "these approaches emphasize the role of a two - photon state at the boundary between the two mentioned cases .",
    "this state is , a bit surprisingly , unentangled in frequencies and , at the first sight , should not be very interesting .",
    "the opposed is true @xcite due to the fact that the signal and idler photons are completely indistinguishable and perfectly synchronized in time for pulsed pumping .",
    "non - collinear configurations of bulk crystals of a suitable length and pump beam with a suitable waist can also be used to generate such state @xcite .",
    "these states with completely indistinguishable photons are very useful in many quantum - information protocols ( e.g. , in linear quantum computing ) that rely on polarization entanglement .",
    "it has been shown that spectral entanglement affects polarization entanglement and causes the lowering of polarization - entanglement performance in quantum - information protocols .",
    "for example , the role of spectral entanglement in polarization quantum teleportation has been analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we note that this analysis is also appropriate for quantum repeaters , quantum relays or quantum repeaters . if two photons are identical and without any mutual entanglement , the polarization degrees of freedom are completely separated from the spectral ones and in principle the best possible performance of quantum information protocols is guaranteed . in practice ,",
    "mode mismatches both in spectral and spatial domains may occur and degrade the performance .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that gaussian distributed photons with large bandwidths represent states with the best tolerance against errors . under these conditions",
    "high visibilities of interference patterns created by a simultaneous detection of in principal many photons are expected .    as shown in this paper , nonlinear layered structures with randomly positioned boundaries",
    "are a natural source of unentangled photon pairs . if the down - converted photons are generated under identical conditions ( i.e. into the same transmission peaks ) they are indistinguishable and thus ideal for quantum - information processing with polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover their spectra are very narrow and temporal wave packets quite long and so their use in experimental setups is fault tolerant against unwanted temporal shifts @xcite .",
    "also because the down - converted photons are generated into localized states with high values of electric - field amplitudes higher photon - pair generation rates are expected .",
    "this is important for protocols exploiting several photon pairs",
    ". these states with very narrow spectra can also be useful in entangled two - photon spectroscopy .",
    "superposition of photon pairs generated under different emission angles is possible and two - photon states coincident in frequencies can be engineered this way .",
    "we note that the use of high electric - field amplitudes occurring in localized states in random structures for the enhancement of nonlinear processes has been studied in detail for second - harmonic generation in @xcite .",

    "we note that the same generation algorithm has been used in @xcite where second - harmonic generation in random structures has been addressed .",
    "the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion can be efficient in these structures provided that the signal and idler fields are generated into transmission peaks ( corresponding to spatially localized states ) and the structure is at least partially transparent for the pump field .",

    "widths of intensity transmission peaks have been determined as fwhm .",
    "simulations have revealed that peaks with very small intensity transmissions prevail , but there occur also peaks with intensity transmissions close to one .",
    "such peaks are useful for the generation of photon pairs because of the presence of high electric - field amplitudes inside the structure .",
    "photon pairs can be also generated under nonzero angles of emission .",
    "the greater the radial angle @xmath76 of signal - photon emission the narrower the transmission peaks as documented in fig .",
    "also the localization lengths ( projected into the direction perpendicular to the boundaries ) shorten with an increasing radial angle @xmath76 of signal - photon emission .",

    "a typical sample has several transmission peaks at different angles @xmath76 of emission for a given frequency of the signal field .",
    "if we assume that also the idler field is tuned into the same transmission peak the ( normally incident ) pump field has to have twice the frequency corresponding to this peak . in non - collinear geometry the transverse wave - vectors of the signal and idler fields have to have the same magnitudes and opposed signs in order to fulfill phase - matching conditions in the transverse plane .",
    "if the angle @xmath76 of signal - photon emission increases a given transmission peak survives increasing its central frequency @xmath81 .",
    "moreover the dependence of central frequency @xmath81 on radial emission angle @xmath82 can be considered to be linear in a certain interval of angles @xmath76 .",
    "this property leads to wide tunability in frequencies .",
    "we assume a normally incident pump beam forming a te wave and generation of the te - polarized signal and idler fields into the same transmission peak .",
    "thus both emitted photons have the same central frequencies and the central frequency of the pump field is twice this frequency , i.e. the conservation law of energy is fulfilled .",

    "[ fig2 ] showing the signal - field intensity spectrum @xmath87 .",
    "width of the spectrum @xmath88 coincides with the width of intensity transmission peak because the transmission peaks are very narrow and so all frequencies inside them have nearly the same conditions for the nonlinear process .",
    "this means that linear properties of the photonic - band - gap structure have a dominant role in the determination of spatial properties of the generated photon pairs .",
    "localization of the signal and idler fields inside the considered photonic - band - gap structure leads to the enhancement of photon - pair generation rate up to 5000 times ( in the middle of transmission peak ) as can be deduced from fig .",
    "this is in accordance with the finding that the process of second - harmonic generation can be enhanced by 3 or 4 orders of magnitude @xcite in these structures .",
    "this enhancement is at the expense of dramatic narrowing of the range of the allowed frequencies of emitted photons .",
    "we estimate from 10 to @xmath89 generated photon pairs into the whole emission cone per 100  mw of the pump power depending on the width of transmission peak .",

    "a typical shape of the two - photon spectral amplitude @xmath11 resembling a cross in its contour plot ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) reflects the fact that the signal and idler fields are nearly perfectly separable .",

    "its contour plot resembles a droplet @xcite that originates in the zig - zag movement of the emitted photons inside the structure that delays the occurrence time of photons at the output plane of the structure .",
    "both photons have the same wave - packets due to identical emission conditions as can be verified in hong - ou - mandel interferometer showing the visibility equal to one .    assuming the normally incident pump beam the signal - field intensity profile at a given frequency in the transverse plane is nonzero around a circle due to the rotational symmetry of the photonic - band - gap structure around the pump - beam propagation direction .",
    "this symmetry assumes an appropriate rotation of polarization base vectors .",
    "however , values of intensity change around the circle depending on fields polarizations ( defined by analyzers in front of detectors ) and properties of nonlinear tensor @xmath2 .    correlations between the signal and idler fields in the transverse plane are characterized by a correlation area that is defined by the probability of emitting an idler photon in a given direction [ defined by angular declinations @xmath95 ( radial direction ) and @xmath96 ( azimuthal direction ) from the ideal direction of emission ] provided that the direction of signal - photon emission is fixed .",
    "correlation area is in general an ellipse with typical lengths in radial ( @xmath97 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath98 ) directions .",
    "these angles are very small for plane - wave pumping , typically of the order of @xmath99  rad . however , focusing of the pump beam can increase their values considerably as shown in fig .",

    "spread of the correlation area in radial direction is smaller compared to that in azimuthal direction , because emission of a photon is more restricted in radial direction ( for geometry reasons ) by narrow bands of the photonic structure .",
    "release of strict phase - matching conditions in the transverse plane caused by a focused pump beam ( with a circular spot ) affects radial and azimuthal angles of emission in the same way .",
