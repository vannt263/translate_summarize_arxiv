    "the _ starving random walk _ represents an idealized description for the dynamics of a forager without any sensory awareness who randomly searches for food in an environment that is depleted by the foraging process itself  @xcite . in this model , the forager undergoes an unbiased nearest - neighbor random walk on a regular @xmath0-dimensional lattice , in which each lattice site initially contains one food unit .",
    "the walk has a metabolic capacity , or intrinsic starvation time @xmath1 , which is defined as the number of steps that the walk can travel without encountering food before starving to death .",
    "each time the walk lands on an empty site , it comes one time unit closer to starvation .",
    "however , if the walk lands on a site that contains food , the food is instantaneously and completely consumed , and the walk can again travel @xmath1 additional steps without encountering food before starving .",
    "our goal in this work is to quantitatively account for the phenomenon of starvation , in which an organism fails to find resources before it expends its own metabolic reserves and starves to death .",
    "this search for resources is an essential task of all living organisms  @xcite , in which the resource could be nourishment , an abode , or a particular individual .",
    "here we view the resource as food that is gradually depleted through consumption by foragers ; the ecologically relevant situation where the resource is replenished has also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "search for a resource has been extensively studied for an omniscient forager that has full knowledge of its environment ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this",
    "setting , the basic objective is to determine the criterion that optimizes the foraging process .",
    "our focus is on the complementary case where the forager has no environmental knowledge nor the ability to learn about its environment .",
    "because the resource is gradually depleted by the forager , the ultimate fate of the forager is to necessarily starve .",
    "an important aspect of the starving random walk is that it moves in the same manner , irrespective of its distance to food sources , as well as whether or not it has recently encountered food .",
    "this feature contrasts with the _ excited _ random walk  @xcite , in which the walk continues to move in the same direction when it encounters food and wanders randomly when it does not . while the excited random walk exhibits surprising properties , the starving random walk is also quite phenomenologically rich .",
    "the salient feature of the starving random walk is that its mortality is coupled to its gradually depleting environment . in this sense",
    "the starving random walk also differs from _ mortal _ random walk models  @xcite , in which a walk spontaneously dies at a fixed rate , independent of its trajectory .",
    "we will investigate two basic questions : ( i ) how long does a forager live ?",
    "( ii ) what is the spatial extent of the region explored by a forager before it starves",
    "? the behaviors of two quantities depend in an essential way on the metabolic capacity @xmath1 and the spatial dimension @xmath0 , as previously discussed in  @xcite . here , we provide details of the derivation of these results , as well as qualitative arguments to support our analytical and numerical results",

    ", the forager tends to carve out a compact depleted spatial region  which we define as the `` desert''because of the recurrence of the random walk  @xcite , and then starve before it can escape this desert . as a consequence",
    ", the forager lifetime grows slowly with @xmath1linearly in @xmath1 for @xmath3 and as @xmath4 with @xmath5 for for the ecologically relevant case of @xmath6 , as will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] .",
    "we also introduce a circular approximation to provide a lower bound for the lifetime and number of sites visited at the instant of starvation in @xmath6 .    as the spatial dimension increases ,",
    "the transience of the random walk implies the forager is less likely to return to previously depleted sites .",
    "consequently , the lifetime of the forager should be an increasing function of the dimension for a fixed metabolic capacity @xmath7 .",
    "thus a starving random walk is long - lived for @xmath8 ; simulations suggest that the average survival time grows as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 in @xmath11 and with @xmath12 a gradually increasing function of the spatial dimension  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : infd ] , we present a mean - field approximation in which successive visits to food - containing sites are uncorrelated ; this description corresponds to the starving random walk model in the limit of @xmath13 . here",
    ", we solve for the first - passage probability for the walk to starve , from which we find that the average forager lifetime grows exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "we close with some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "calculational details for the distribution of visited sites and the average lifetime in one and two dimensions are presented in the appendices .",
    "the evolution of the system in one dimension is schematically illustrated in fig .  [ interval ] . as the walk moves ,",
    "a region of length @xmath14 that is devoid of food  the desert  is carved out .",
    "the survival of the walk is controlled by the interplay between its wandering and going hungry in the desert interior and reaching the edge of this desert to consume food .",
    "we are interested in the average of the lifetime of the walk and of the number of distinct sites visited by the walk , as well as the distribution of the latter at the moment of starvation . because of the simplicity of one dimension",
    ", these properties can all be calculated explicitly .",

    "we estimate the average walk lifetime by partitioning a typical trajectory into three stages :    1 .",
    "the walk first carves out a desert of a `` dangerous '' critical length @xmath16duration @xmath17 .",

    "duration @xmath20 .    during stage ( i ) , the walk successively reaches either edge of the desert and extends it by one lattice spacing as long as the average crossing time @xmath21 is less than the metabolic capacity @xmath1 .",
    "equation   applies for a walk that starts a distance @xmath15 from one edge of a desert of length @xmath22 and reaches the other side  @xcite .",
    "we define the critical desert length @xmath23 by the condition that the walk typically starves when it attempts to cross the desert .",
    "this gives @xmath24 , or @xmath25 in the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "when the length of the desert equals @xmath26 , the average time @xmath27 needed to reach _ either _ edge of the desert when starting a distance @xmath15 from one edge is  @xcite @xmath28 thus the duration @xmath17 of the first stage of a typical trajectory is the sum of these average return times @xmath27 until the desert reaches the critical length @xmath29 : @xmath30    during stage ( ii ) , the walk likely starves if it attempts to cross the desert .",
    "thus it continues to survive only if it makes repeated excursions to the same side of the desert .",
    "suppose that the walk is at the left edge at the end of stage ( i ) .",
    "the walk will typically return @xmath18 times to this edge before attempting to cross the desert , which results in its starvation .",
    "the probabilities that the walk _ eventually _ hits the left edge or the right edge of a desert of length @xmath22 when starting a distance @xmath15 from the left edge are , respectively ,  @xcite @xmath31 and the conditional first - passage time to the left edge is @xmath32 the probability @xmath33 that a random walk hits the left edge @xmath34 times before hitting the right edge , starting from a desert of length @xmath16 , therefore is @xmath35(l_c+ka)}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first @xmath36 terms in the product give the probabilities for the walk to successively hit the left edge ; after each such event the interval grows by @xmath15 . the last factor",
    "is the probability to hit the right edge when the interval has reached length @xmath37 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that this probability distribution is normalized , @xmath38 .",
    "because @xmath39 for large @xmath34 , the average number of same - side excursions until the right edge is reached , @xmath40 , is infinite .",
    "nevertheless , the _ typical _ number @xmath18 of same - side excursions is meaningful .",
    "this quantity can be defined as the median number of such excursions , so that @xmath41 .",
    "this gives @xmath42 thus for an interval of length @xmath16 , the right edge will typically be reached after @xmath43 consecutive same - side excursions to the left edge .",
    "this condition defines the end of the stage ( ii ) .",
    "its duration @xmath19 is the sum of the average conditional return times to the same edge of the desert when starting one lattice spacing away from this edge : @xmath44 finally , in stage ( iii ) , the walk fails to return to the left edge of the desert within @xmath1 steps .",
    "the duration @xmath20 of this terminal stage is exactly @xmath1 steps .",
    "we therefore estimate of the average lifetime @xmath45 of the starving random walk as @xmath46 compared to the exact asymptotic value of 3.27686  @xmath1 that will be derived in the next section ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are comparable when @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , the above heuristic approach gives the average number of distinct sites visited @xmath48 as @xmath49 compared to the exact asymptotic value of 2.9022 ",
    "@xmath50  @xcite that we will also derive in the next section .",
    "we now calculate the average number of distinct sites visited by the walk and its distribution at the instant when the walk starves , as well as its average lifetime .",
    "we then provide explicit results by an asymptotic analysis .",
    "for an unbiased @xmath51-step nearest - neighbor random walk in one dimension , the average number of distinct sites visited , which is also the span of the walk divided by the lattice spacing @xmath15 , asymptotically grows as @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "the new feature for starving random walks is that there can not exist excursions of more than @xmath1 consecutive steps in the previous history in which the walk does not encounter food .",
    "thus a long - lived starving random walk spends less time roaming within the interior of a desert than an unrestricted random walk . as a consequence , the number of distinct sites visited by starving random walks should be larger than that for unrestricted random walks at the same time .    to determine the number of distinct sites visited and its distribution at the instant of starvation , we define @xmath53 , the probability that a random walk has visited @xmath54 distinct sites when starvation occurs",
    ". we may express this probability as @xmath55 where @xmath56 with @xmath57 the first - passage probability to either edge of an interval of length @xmath26 when the walk starts a distance @xmath15 from one edge .",

    "the details of this derivation are given in [ p ] ; we make contact with the discrete nearest - neighbor random walk by setting the diffusion coefficient @xmath60 . from the asymptotic result given in eq .",
    ", the average number of visited sites at the starvation time is , in the large @xmath7 limit , @xmath61 where we take the continuum limit and express the distribution of visited sites in terms of the scaled variable @xmath62 , with @xmath63 . using the explicit form for the distribution @xmath64 in eq .   and",
    "computing this integral numerically gives @xmath65    we now turn to the average lifetime @xmath45 , which we write as @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the average return time for the random walk to hit either edge of the interval in the @xmath68 excursion , conditioned on the walk hitting either edge before it starves , while the term @xmath1 accounts for the final excursion in which the walk starves . by definition @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath67 and subsequently @xmath45 are presented in [ tau ] and the final result is @xmath71    thus the average lifetime of a starving random walk also scales linearly in @xmath1 . roughly speaking",
    ", the same amount of time is spent in carving out a desert to reach the critical length , then in enlarging it always via the same edge , before finally attempting ( and failing ) to cross this desert .",
    "the underlying distributions of visited sites and lifetimes are visually similar and are characterized by a well - defined peak near the average value and an exponential large - argument tail .",
    "two dimensions is the ecologically relevant situation because of the obvious connection to the movement of land foragers .",
    "this case is also theoretically interesting because @xmath6 is the critical dimension between recurrence and transience of random walks  @xcite .",
    "four sample trajectories of starving random walks at the instant of starvation are given in fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] for metabolic capacity @xmath72 to show the types of trajectories that arise .",
    "a walk survives if it never makes an excursion of more than @xmath1 steps anytime in its past history without encountering food .",
    "thus the effect of starvation is to progressively bias the ensemble of random walks as time increases . for fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "a short - lived trajectory is relatively compact so that a desert is quickly carved out within which the walk starves .",
    "conversely , a long - lived walk typically has a ramified trajectory to ensure that the walk remains close to food - containing sites and thus is unlikely to starve .",
    "the starvation constraint on the trajectories is highly non - trivial and we have been unable to solve the problem by exact methods .",
    "thus we turn to simulations and crude approximations to elucidate some basic properties of starving random walks in two dimensions .",
    "our simulations are typically based on @xmath73 realizations of nearest - neighbor random walks that wander until they starve , for metabolic capacities @xmath1 between 10 and 2000 . for each walk , we record the time at the instant of starvation , the position of the walk , and the number of distinct sites visited ( equal to the amount of food that the walk has eaten ) . from these data , we reconstruct the underlying distributions of these quantities .    a plot of the average number of distinct sites visited at starvation ( fig .",
    "[ s - av-2d ] ) is suggestive of the algebraic behavior @xmath74 . while a naive linear fit to the data on a double logarithmic scale gives @xmath75",
    ", there is a systematic upward curvature in the data of @xmath76 versus @xmath77 .",
    "we account for this curvature by defining two types of @xmath1-dependent exponents : ( a ) a local exponent that is obtained from the slopes of four adjacent data points in a window that is moved to progressively larger @xmath1 , and ( b ) a running exponent that is obtained by successively deleting the first point , the first two points , the first three points , etc .  in the data .",
    "these two @xmath1-dependent exponents both appear to extrapolate to the common value @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ s - av-2d](a ) inset ) .",
    "( for the average lifetime and the root - mean - square displacement , we use only the running exponent because it has smaller fluctuations . )   the closeness of this exponent to 2 and the fact that @xmath6 is the critical dimension of random walks may indicative that the true dependence of @xmath48 on @xmath1 is quadratic but modified by a logarithmic correction .",
    "perhaps the most surprising aspect of this data is that the distribution of distinct sites visited at the instant of starvation does not satisfy single - parameter scaling , as initially reported in  @xcite .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the cases of @xmath3 and @xmath11 , where this same distribution does obey single - parameter scaling .",
    "this lack of scaling indicates that two dimensions represents a unique situation .",
    "the dependence of the average walk lifetime @xmath45 on @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ t - av-2d ] .",
    "again , there is a small and systematic upward curvature of the data of @xmath45 versus @xmath1 on a double logarithmic scale .",
    "thus we employ the same analysis as that used for the number of distinct sites visited , to estimate that the asymptotic exponent for the lifetime extrapolates to a value near 1.9 ( inset to fig .",
    "[ t - av-2d](a ) ) the closeness of this exponent estimate to 2 is again suggestive that perhaps the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath1 may be modified by a logarithmic correction .",
    "the distribution of lifetimes for different values of @xmath1 collapse onto a single universal curve , with an exponential long - time decay , when each distribution is scaled by the average lifetime @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ t - av-2d](b ) ) .",
    "this contrasts with the lack of scaling displayed by the distribution of visited sites .",
    "finally , we study the root - mean - square displacement of a single cartesian coordinate @xmath79 and its distribution at the instant of starvation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ avr](a ) , it appears that @xmath80 , with @xmath81 close to 1 .",
    "this dependence accords with naive expectations based on the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath1 .",
    "namely , if @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and furthermore , the distribution of lifetimes is sharply peaked about its most probable value , then we should expect that @xmath84 , which is the same scaling of rms displacement versus time as an unrestricted random walk . finally , fig .",
    "[ avr](b ) shows the scaled distribution of the absolute value of a single coordinate at the instant of starvation .",
    "the distributions for different @xmath7 all collapse onto a universal curve that decays exponentially , in contrast to the gaussian decay of a pure random walk .",
    "this distinction stems from the difference between the ensemble of trajectories of a starving random walk and that of an unconstrained random walk .",
    "indeed , the long - lived trajectories for a starving random walk are more ramified and more spatially extended than for a pure random walk , as the walk needs to remain close to resources to survive .      because of the typically labyrinthine desert geometry in two dimensions , it does not seem feasible to determine the properties of two - dimensional starving random walks exactly .",
    "thus we develop an approximation that is based on the assumption that the desert remains circular at all times . while obviously crude ( compare with fig .  [ snapshots ] )",
    ", this approximation provides a lower bound for the average lifetime at starvation because a circular desert is the most unfavorable geometry for the walk to survive .",
    "we now adapt the heuristic argument given in  [ heuristic ] for one dimension to this circular approximation .",
    "each time the walk hits the edge of the desert , it eats one unit of food , which we take to be a small patch of area @xmath85 , with @xmath15 the lattice spacing .",
    "after each meal , the area of the desert increases by @xmath85 so that its radius after @xmath51 meals is @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , we assume that after reaching the desert boundary , the walk starts a distance @xmath15 from the enlarged boundary to begin another excursion ( fig .",

    "[ heuristic ] , we again decompose a typical trajectory into three phases :    1 .",
    "the walk carves out a circular desert of a `` dangerous '' radius @xmath87 .",
    "2 .   after @xmath87 is reached , the walk makes @xmath18 excursions into the desert without starving .",
    "the walk wanders too deeply into the desert and starves .",
    "the desert radius reaches a dangerous value @xmath87 when the average time to go from the edge to the center is roughly one - half of the metabolic capacity @xmath1 .",
    "this typically corresponds to the average conditional time to reach a small disk in the center of the desert without having touched its edge , at the radius @xmath87 , starting from a radius @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "this gives the criterion @xmath89 from which @xmath90 .",
    "we now estimate the time to reach this critical radius .",
    "when the desert is subcritical , a forager typically survives an excursion no matter where it exits the desert . for a walk that starts at radius @xmath91 , the time to reach the edge of the desert is @xmath92 .",
    "the number of meals @xmath93 that the forager must eat for the desert to reach the critical radius is determined from @xmath94 , or @xmath95 .",
    "thus the duration of phase ( i ) is the sum of the excursion times until the critical radius is reached : @xmath96    as we will show , the duration of phases ( ii ) and ( iii ) are negligible compared to phase ( i ) .",

    ", if we know the typical number @xmath18 of times that the walk returns to the edge of the desert of initial radius @xmath87 before starving , then its duration is given by @xmath97 while we are unable to determine @xmath18 , we can provide an upper bound that we write as @xmath98 .",
    "suppose that the desert radius remains fixed at @xmath87 each time the walk returns to the boundary .",
    "the number of returns @xmath98 in this case is strictly greater than @xmath18 . to estimate @xmath98 , we need the probability @xmath99 that the walk does not starve in this fixed - size desert between two consecutive returns to the edge of the desert .",
    "we estimate @xmath99 as the probability that the walk does not reach the core of the desert , which we take as a small disk of radius @xmath100 that is much less than @xmath87 .",

    "thus the walk eventually must starve .",
    "one can also readily verify that the average first - passage time given in is reproduced by @xmath151 because @xmath152 has a simple pole at @xmath153 to lowest order , the first - passage probability decays exponentially with time .",
    "the characteristic decay time of the first - passage probability is given by @xmath154 , which has the same scaling as the average first - passage time given in eq .  .",
    "finally , we determine the distribution of the number of sites visited by the walk on the lattice . the essential ingredient to determine",
    "this distribution is the return probability @xmath155 , namely , the probability for a walk that starts from site @xmath51 in starvation space to reach @xmath1 without first hitting 0 .",
    "each such return corresponds to the random walk visiting a new site on the physical lattice without starving .",
    "these return probabilities satisfy the recursion @xmath156 in the equation for @xmath155 , the first term accounts for the walk hitting a previously unvisited site , in which case the walk is at site @xmath1 in starvation space , while the second term accounts for the walk hitting an empty site , in which case the walk is at site @xmath134 in starvation space .    the solution to this recursion",
    "is simply @xmath157 . from these return probabilities ,",
    "we now infer the distribution of distinct sites visited at starvation . for a walk that starts at site @xmath1 in starvation space , the probability that @xmath54 distinct sites",
    "are visited on the lattice before the walk starves is simply given by @xmath158 this equation expresses the fact that to visit @xmath54 distinct sites on the lattice , the walk must visit a full site @xmath54 times , each within @xmath1 steps , before the walk staves . from this result ,",
    "the average number of distinct sites visited before the walk starves is @xmath159 as might be expected in this mean - field description , the average lifetime given in eq .   and the average number of distinct sites visited before starving are the same up to an overall constant factor of @xmath129 , and both grow exponentially with the metabolic capacity @xmath7 .",
    "these long - lived trajectories in large spatial dimension arise from the low probability to encounter a previously visited site .",
    "the starving random walk model represents a minimalist description for the consumption of a depleting resource by an unaware forager .",
    "while there is much literature on optimizing the search for resources by a rational forager that possesses complete knowledge of its environment ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the complementary starving random walk model in which the forager has no propensity to move toward food and no environmental knowledge seems mostly unexplored .",
    "the fundamental parameters for a starving random walk are its metabolic capacity @xmath1 , namely , the number of steps that the walk can wander in a row without food before starving to death , and secondarily the spatial dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the latter parameter enters because of the non - trivial dimension dependence of visits to distinct sites for random walks .",
    "we solved the starving random walk model in one dimension by probabilistic methods to give the average lifetime of the walk , the average number of distinct sites visited at the instant of starvation , and the distribution of the latter .",
    "qualitatively , a forager carves out a growing desert until the desert reaches a dangerous critical length of the order of @xmath160 .",
    "when this length is reached , the walk can still survive if it returns to the same side of the desert , but starves when it attempts to cross to the other side . from this picture , the average number of distinct sites visited at the instant of starvation , which is the same as the total amount of consumed food , scales as @xmath50 , while the average lifetime scales as @xmath1",
    ".    in the ecologically relevant case of two dimensions , a probabilistic solution for the lifetime and number of distinct sites visited remains an open challenge . by numerical simulations ,",
    "both the average number of distinct sites visited and the average lifetime appear to scale algebraically with @xmath1 , with an exponent close to 1.8 for the former quantity and exponent close to 1.9 for the latter . the spatial probability distribution of starving random walks is exponential rather than the gaussian for a pure random walk .",
    "this difference reflects the feature that a long - lived starving random walk remains close to the source of food , which means that it should explore a ramified and more spatially extended region than a pure random walk .",
    "we provided a ( weak ) lower bound for the average lifetime and number of distinct sites visited within a circular approximation .",
    "the two - dimensional case is particularly challenging , as the distribution of the distinct sites visited does not obey single - parameter scaling  @xcite and the relation between the geometry of the carved out desert and the lifetime of the walk is not yet resolved .    in greater than two dimensions , the transience of the random walk means that visits to new ( i.e. , food containing ) sites occur at a fixed rate . thus a starving random walk is much more long lived for @xmath8 than in @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , we previously found  @xcite that the average lifetime @xmath45 grows as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 in @xmath11 and with @xmath12 slowly growing with @xmath0 .",
    "simulation results up to 5 dimensions suggest that @xmath161 is a continuously growing function of dimension  @xcite and @xmath161 reaches the mean - field value of 1 only when @xmath127 .",
    "preliminary numerical simulations indicate that the distribution of times between visits to distinct sites has a slower than exponential decay for spatial dimensions @xmath8 and only gradually approaches an exponential decay for @xmath127  @xcite .",
    "these features suggest that the critical dimension of the starving random walk problem may be infinite .    thus starving random",
    "walks represent a new type of non - equilibrium process in which the dynamics is controlled by the times _ between visits to distinct sites _ in a random walk .",
    "while much is known about the average number of distinct sites visited and its underlying distribution for random walks  @xcite , little appears to be known about the times between visits to new sites , as well as the distribution of times between such visits .",
    "this aspect of the starving random walk model is very much worth exploring .",
