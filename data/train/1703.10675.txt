    "in general , traditional manifold learning algorithms can be roughly divided into two classes : one is to preserve the global geometric structure of manifold , such as isomap @xcite ; the other one is to preserve the local neighborhood geometric structure , such as lle @xcite , lep @xcite , lpp @xcite , ltsa @xcite , hessian eigenmap @xcite et al .",
    "isomap aimed to preserve the geodesic distance between any two high dimensional data points , which can be viewed as an extension of multidimensional scaling ( mds ) @xcite . local neighborhood preserving algorithms approximated manifolds with a union of locally linear patches . after the local patches",
    "are estimated with linear methods such as pca @xcite , the global representation is obtained by aligning the local patches together .",
    "traditional manifold learning algorithms often bear an assumption that the local patch of any point on embedded manifold is roughly equal to the tangent space at that point . despite the success of manifold learning in many applications",
    ", there are still several problems remaining .    * * locally short circuit problem : * if the embedded manifold is highly curved , the euclidean distance between any two points is obviously shorter than the intrinsic geodesic distance . *",
    "* * intrinsic dimension estimation problem:**since tangent spaces are simply taken as local patches , the intrinsic dimension of manifold can not be determined by the latter , in particular in case of strongly varying curvature . *",
    "* curvature sensitivity problem : * if the curvature of original manifold is especially high at some point , smaller patches are needed for representing the neighborhoods around this point .",
    "but one may not have as many data points as needed to produce enough small patches , especially when the data points are sparse .    among the above mentioned three problems ,",
    "the third one is critical .",
    "it is the background of the other two . to solve",
    "this problem is the main target of this paper .      in",
    "manifold learning one usually maps an irregularly curved manifold to a lower dimensional space directly .",
    "this is often unpractical since care is not taken of the varying geometric structure of the manifold at different points .",
    "ricci flow is a very useful tool for evolving an irregular manifold and making it converging to a regular one ( constant curvature manifold ) . in this paper",
    "we first analysis the intrinsic curvature of a manifold at each point and then use ricci flow to regularize the metric and curvature of the manifold before reducing its dimension . since ricci flow preserves local structure of manifold and the riemannian metric of the manifold after ricci flow is uniform ( see section 2 ) , the local relationships among data points in the whole process of algorithm are preserved . in the current presentation",
    "we only consider open riemannian manifolds with non - negative ricci curvature .",
    "manifold learning with negative ricci curvature will be discussed in our next paper .",
    "we call this style of algorithm dynamic manifold learning .",

    "@xmath30 the riemannian metric @xmath31 satisfies the metric equivalence condition @xmath32 @xcite , where @xmath33 .",
    "so the relative geodesic distance between arbitrary two neighborhood points on @xmath8 is consistent under the ricci flow . in @xcite researchers have worked out that the riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath34 can be transformed to a sphere under the spherical condition with the sectional curvature @xmath35 satisfied @xmath36 everywhere .",
    "in practice , it is difficult to analyze the global structure of a nonlinear manifold , especially when there is no observable explicit structure . in this paper",
    "we decompose the embedded manifold into a set of overlapping patches and apply ricci flow to these overlapping patches independently of each other to avoid singular points .",
    "the global structure of deformed manifold under ricci flow can be obtained from the deformed local patches with a suitable alignment .",

    "a smooth representation of local patch @xmath40 under the local coordinate system is described by : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a coordinate chart at @xmath40 .",
    "+ we use _ least square _ method to approximate the analytic functions @xmath65 . in order to guarantee the curvature operator on each patch",
