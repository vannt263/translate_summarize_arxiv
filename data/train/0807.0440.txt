    "post - starburst galaxies ( or psgs , or e+a galaxies , or k+a / a+k galaxies ) are characterized by their optical spectra , independent of any morphological or photometric considerations .",
    "psgs contain a sizable population of very young stars , producing very prominent balmer lines , but lack ongoing star formation , hence the absence of detectable emission lines .",
    "this suggests that psgs are indeed observed very shortly , within less than 1  gyr , after the end of a vigorous , abruptly truncated starburst @xcite .",
    "today , they constitute only a small fraction of the galaxy cluster population ( @xmath3% , @xcite ) ; at intermediate - redshifts , however , they constituted a substantial cluster population @xcite .",
    "although the trigger and the abrupt end of the starburst is still not fully understood , photometry of psgs shows evidence for disturbed morphologies , e.g. tidal tails , suggesting that in many cases the trigger is most likely associated to a galaxy - galaxy merger or interaction @xcite . using numerical simulations",
    ", @xcite has shown that psgs can be formed via a major merger of two gas - rich spiral galaxies . in these merger simulations",
    ", a starburst is triggered that consumes the available gas within a timespan of roughly 1  gyr , ending the starburst abruptly .",
    "recent  observations have uncovered large quantities of neutral hydrogen gas in a significant fraction of psgs @xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of investigating the hypothesized merger origin of many psgs .",
    "indeed , high - resolution interferometric radio observations of the neutral gas would provide valuable additional information .",
    "on the one hand ,  morphologies and velocity fields , if they are distorted , could corroborate the merger hypothesis , and , moreover , could reveal whether at least part of the neutral gas is still gravitationally bound and will remain available for future star formation .",
    "we selected the psg binary ea01a / b as an interesting target for our study .",
    "both galaxies have a psg - type optical spectrum and have the same recession velocity .",
    "ea01a is the bluest galaxy of the psg sample of @xcite , suggesting it is also the youngest sample member .",
    "hst / wfpc2 images in the f435w and f702w bands @xcite provide strong evidence that the couple is interacting .",
    "ea01a , positioned about 11@xmath4 east of ea01b , contains many stellar clusters that are very conspicuous compared with the overall rather low surface brightness of this galaxy .",
    "this diffuse appearance suggests it is on the verge of disintegrating due to the injected orbital energy .",
    "ea01b , on the other hand , is a bulge dominated early - type spiral galaxy ; it sports strongly asymmetric stellar arms .",
    "both galaxies appear to be connected by a stellar bridge .",
    "previous hi observations @xcite had already uncovered sizable quantities of neutral gas in or near these galaxies but they lacked the spatial resolution to locate the gas with any precision within this galactic binary system .    in section  [ obs ] ,",
    "we describe our data reduction and analysis of deep archival vla  observations of the ea01a / b galaxy binary .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section  [ discussion ] and summarized in section  [ conclusions ] .",

    "the observations were made with the b configuration during the nights of march 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 , 2001 . at a central frequency of @xmath11  mhz ( l - band ) and with a bandwidth of @xmath12  mhz divided over 63 channels , the  in ea01a / b was mapped with a velocity resolution of @xmath13  kms@xmath5 .",
    "alternating observations of the phase calibrator 1127 - 145 with a 4 minute exposure time and ea01a / b with an exposure time of 25 minutes were made , followed at the end of each night by a 2.5 minute exposure of the flux calibrator 3c286 . this resulted in a total on - source integration time of @xmath14h .",
    "standard flagging and calibration of the @xmath15 data was performed with the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) .",
    "the continuum was subtracted by making a linear fit to the visibilities over the line - free channels that were not affected by the edge effects of the band .",
    "we created the final datacube using natural weighting to optimize the sensitivity .",

    "the  flux integrated map of ea01a / b is presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "all maps are overplotted onto a hst / wfpc2 f702w image of the ea01a / b pair .",
    "it is clear from these maps that the  emission spatially coincides with the optical position of ea01a / b and is centered around the heliocentric velocity of the previous  detection and the optical recession velocity of the pair ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the  profile of ea01a / b , obtained by summing the flux within a box covering the radio emission of the galaxy is plotted in fig .",
    "[ specea1 ] .",
    "we fitted a gaussian to the  spectrum in order to derive the total 21  cm line flux .",
    "we generated a large library of mock  spectra using this gaussian model and added noise to produce synthetic data of the same quality as the original spectrum .",
    "we then fitted gaussian profiles to the mock data in order to estimate the 1@xmath7 uncertainties on all relevant parameters .",
    "we find a total integrated flux of @xmath24  jy  kms@xmath5 .",
    "this is equivalent to an  mass of m@xmath25  m@xmath2 , adopting a luminosity distance d@xmath26=330  mpc .",

    "the central velocity is @xmath31  kms@xmath5  and the fwhm is @xmath32  kms@xmath5 .",
    "this is in agreement with the high - resolution vla data presented here and with @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    a plausible interpretation of the  flux integrated map and the channel maps is that we are seeing one receding gaseous tidal arm emanating from ea01a and two tidal arms connected to ea01b , with the east arm approaching us and the west arm moving away from us .",
    "little of the detected gas appears to be directly connected with the galaxies themselves , which show up as minima in the  column density .",
    "this absence of dense gas may be related to the fact that these galaxies are in a post - starburst phase .",
    "the ea01a arm runs in a south - eastern direction and can be traced through 3 consecutive channel maps from 22372.3  km  s@xmath5 to 22394.5  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the west ea01b `` arm '' shows up as emission in 3 consecutive channel maps from 22372.3  km  s@xmath5 to 22394.5  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "following its position through adjacent channel maps with recession velocities below @xmath33  km  s@xmath5 , the east arm connected with ea01b appears to first shift in the direction of ea01a and then to return a position slightly north of ea01b before disappearing in the noise .",
    "at that point , the gas is moving towards us with a radial velocity of about 40  km  s@xmath5 , relative to the systemic velocity of ea01a / b .",
    "the curvature of the northern arm and the fact that it is approaching us agrees with the curvature of the stellar arms .",
    "since the data quality clearly does not allow for a detailed or quantitative modeling of the gas distribution and kinematics , we constructed a very simplified model for the  observations based on the interpretation outlined above .",
    "two gaseous arms were constructed to emanate from ea01b , following the position and curvature of the stellar arms .",
    "if the ellipticity @xmath34 of the outer isophotes of ea01b is indicative of its inclination , then this early - type disk is inclined by about 30@xmath35 from an edge - on view .",
    "we assumed both arms to lie in a disk with the same inclination .",
    "a third gas arm was connected with ea01a , curving in a south - eastern direction . the  flux density of these model tidal arms was assumed to decline exponentially with radius and they were given solid - body rotation velocity fields in such a way that the mock channel maps and the flux integrated map derived from this model provided an acceptable match to the observed maps , taking into account beam convolution and added noise . despite its simplicity",
    ", this model can give a fair account of the observations . the model flux map and channel maps",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ mom0 ] and can be compared with fig .",
    "[ channels ] .    with a 2@xmath7 density limit of @xmath36 @xmath9 beam@xmath5 , averaged over a @xmath17  kpc@xmath18  kpc beam",
    ", we can not expect to trace the tidal arms very far out . as a comparison , under these conditions it would be impossible to trace the southern arm emanating from the interacting pair ngc4038/4039 ( `` the antennae '' ) further out than @xmath37  kpc @xcite . at the distance of ea01a / b",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath38 , less than two beam diameters . at that distance",
    ", the velocity of the ngc4038/4039 tidal arm is less than @xmath39  km  s@xmath5 , in rough agreement with the largest velocities measured in the ea01a / b system .",
    "ea01a / b is a close pair of post - starburst ( e+a ) galaxies , surrounded by some @xmath40  m@xmath2 of neutral gas .",
    "most of this gas resides in what appear to be three tidal arms , two of which are connected with ea01b . together with optical hst / wfpc2 images , these observations show that ea01a and ea01b are actively interacting .",
    "the galaxies themselves show up as minima in the  column density .",
    "this lack of galaxy - bound dense neutral gas is most likely connected with the fact that these galaxies are in a post - starburst phase .",
