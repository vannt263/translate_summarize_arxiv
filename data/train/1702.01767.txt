    "<S> we revisit the puzzle of @xmath0 values obtained from the conventional implementation of hadronic-@xmath1-decay - based flavor - breaking finite - energy sum rules lying @xmath2 below the expectations of three - family unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> significant unphysical dependences of @xmath0 on the choice of weight , @xmath3 , and upper limit , @xmath4 , of the experimental spectral integrals entering the analysis are confirmed , and a breakdown of assumptions made in estimating higher dimension , @xmath5 , ope contributions is identified as the main source of these problems . a combination of continuum and lattice results is shown to suggest a new implementation of the flavor - breaking sum rule approach in which not only @xmath0 , but also @xmath5 effective condensates , are fit to data . </S>",
    "<S> lattice results are also used to clarify how to reliably treat the slowly converging @xmath6 ope series . </S>",
    "<S> the new sum rule implementation is shown to cure the problems of the unphysical @xmath3- and @xmath4-dependence of @xmath0 and to produce results @xmath7 higher than those of the conventional implementation . with b - factory input , including a new preliminary result for the exclusive @xmath8 branching fraction , we find @xmath9 , in excellent agreement with the result from @xmath10 , and compatible within errors with the expectations of three - family unitarity , thus resolving the long - standing inclusive @xmath1 @xmath0 puzzle . </S>"
