    "for example , the @xmath5 doubly stochastic matrices , @xmath6 form a 4-dimensional polytope with 6 vertices . shortly after proving this characterization , birkhoff ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 111 ) initiated the search for a infinite - dimensional generalization , thus stimulating a line of research which remains fruitful even today .",

    "the set of doubly stochastic measures forms a convex set we denote by @xmath9 ( which is weak-@xmath10 compact in the banach space dual to continuous functions",
    "@xmath11 ^ 2)$ ] normed by their suprema @xmath12 ) .",
    "a measure is said to be _ extremal _ in @xmath9 if it can not be decomposed as a convex combination @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , except trivially with @xmath16 . since the krein - milman theorem asserts that convex combinations of extreme points are dense ( in any compact convex subset of a topological vector space , figure [ fig.extreme ] ) , it is natural to want to characterize the extreme points of @xmath9 .",
    "another motivation for such a characterization is that every continuous linear functional on @xmath9 is minimized at an extreme point .",
    "whether or not this extremum is uniquely attained can be an interesting question : in figure [ fig.extreme ] the horizontal coordinate is minimized at a single point but maximized at two extreme points ( and along the segment joining them ) .",
    "motivated by applications like the optimization problem just mentioned , we prefer to formulate the question in slightly greater generality , by replacing the two copies of @xmath17,\\lambda)$ ] with probability spaces @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are each subsets of a complete separable metric space , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are borel probability measures on @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "this widens applicability of the answer to this question without increasing its difficulty . letting @xmath24 denote the borel probability measures on @xmath25 having @xmath22 and @xmath23 for marginals",
    ", we wish to characterize the extreme points of the convex set @xmath24 . ideally , as in the finite - dimensional case",
    ", this characterization would be given in terms of some geometrical property of the support of the measure @xmath0 in @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are finite , our problem reduces to characterizing the extreme points of the convex set @xmath28 of @xmath29 matrices with prescribed column and row sums : @xmath30 a matrix @xmath31 is well - known to be extremal in @xmath28 if and only if it is _ acyclic _ , meaning for every sequence @xmath32 of non - zero entries occupying @xmath33 distinct columns and @xmath34 distinct rows , the product @xmath35 must vanish  see figure [ fig.acyclic ] or denny @xcite , where the terminology _ aperiodic _ is used . similarly",
    ", a set @xmath36 is acyclic if for every @xmath33 distinct points @xmath37 and @xmath38 , at least one of the pairs @xmath39 lies outside of @xmath40 .    a functional analytic characterization of extremality was supplied by douglas @xcite and by lindenstrauss @xcite : it asserts that @xmath0 is extremal in @xmath24 if and only if @xmath41 is dense in @xmath42 .",
    "although this result is a useful starting point , it is not quite the characterization we desire for applications , since it is not easily expressed in terms of the geometry of the support of @xmath0 .",
    "significant further progress was made by bene and tpn , who showed every extremal doubly stochastic measure vanishes outside some acyclic subset @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "hestir and williams refined this condition , showing that it becomes sufficient under an additional borel measurability hypothesis which , unfortunately , is not always satisfied @xcite .",
    "some of the subtleties of the problem were indicated already by losert s counterexamples losert82 .",
    "the difficulty of the problem resides partly in the fact that any geometrical characterization of optimality must be invariant under arbitrary measure - preserving transformations applied independently to the horizontal ( abscissa ) and vertical ( ordinate ) variables .    in this manuscript",
    "we review this line of research , clarifying the nature of the gap separating necessity from sufficiency and pointing out that it can be narrowed slightly by replacing the borel @xmath43-algebra with suitably adapted measure - completions .",
    "we conclude by describing an application to the question of uniqueness in optimal transportation , which is one of the original and most important examples of an infinite - dimensional program @xcite , and appears naturally in applications @xcite @xcite .",
    "it arises when one wants to use a continuum of sources to supply a continuum of sinks ( modeled by @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively ) as efficiently as possible .",
    "the question addressed is to identify cost functions @xmath44 on the product space @xmath25 whose minimum expected value against measures in @xmath24 is uniquely attained .",
    "when @xmath20 and @xmath21 are differentiable manifolds and @xmath45 , to guarantee uniqueness it turns out to be sufficient that @xmath46 imply @xmath47 has no critical points , except perhaps for a single global maximum and a single global minimum .",
    "this generalizes to some compact manifolds @xmath20 a criterion of gangbo @xcite , carlier @xcite , levin @xcite and ma , trudinger and wang @xcite , which asserts that the absence of critical points implies uniqueness ; ( their condition further implies that almost every source supplies a single sink , thus solving another transportation problem first posed by monge @xcite , which our condition does not do ) .",
    "when satisfied , our criterion implies that the manifold @xmath20 , if compact , has the topology of the sphere .",
    "uniqueness , however , remains an interesting open question for compact manifolds which are not topological spheres .",
    "this surprising application was first developed in an economic context by chiappori , mccann , and nesheim @xcite .",
    "before recalling the characterization of interest , let us develop a bit of notation in a simpler setting , and a key argument that we shall require .",

    "<S> this article connects the theory of extremal doubly stochastic measures to the geometry and topology of optimal transportation .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by reviewing an old question ( # 111 ) of birkhoff in probability and statistics @xcite , which is to give a necessary and sufficient condition on the support of a joint probability to guarantee extremality among all measures which share its marginals . </S>",
    "<S> following work of douglas , lindenstrauss , and bene and tpn , hestir and williams  @xcite found a necessary condition which is nearly sufficient ; we relax their subtle measurability hypotheses separating necessity from sufficiency slightly , yet demonstrate by example that to be sufficient certainly requires some measurability . </S>",
    "<S> their condition amounts to the vanishing of @xmath0 outside a countable alternating sequence of graphs and antigraphs in which no two graphs ( or two antigraphs ) have domains that overlap , and where the domain of each graph / antigraph in the sequence contains the range of the succeeding antigraph ( respectively , graph ) . </S>",
    "<S> such sequences are called _ numbered limb systems_. surprisingly , this characterization can be used to resolve the uniqueness question for optimal transportation on manifolds with the topology of the sphere . </S>"
