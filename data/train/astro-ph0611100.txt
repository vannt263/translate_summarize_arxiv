    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are a small group of isolated , young neutron stars with spin periods falling in a narrow range ( 512  s ) , very soft x - ray spectra in the 0.510 kev range , and with x - ray burst activity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they were considered `` anomalous '' because their x - ray luminosities greatly exceed the power available from the rotational kinetic energy of the pulsars . along with soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) ,",
    "these objects are believed to be neutron stars having extremely strong ( @xmath5 g ) surface magnetic fields ( `` magnetars '' ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to studies at x - ray energies , effort has been made to observe axps at optical and infrared ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "since the discovery of the optical / near - ir counterpart to axp 4u 0142@xmath661 @xcite , four other axps , 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  @xcite , 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  @xcite , xte  j1810@xmath0197  @xcite , and 1e 2259@xmath6586 @xcite , were also identified in the near - ir . the observed near - ir emission , which greatly exceeds the extrapolated spectrum of the x - ray blackbody component of axps , is likely related to the x - ray emission ",
    "axps show very similar @xmath7-band to x - ray flux ratios ( 1.73.7 @xmath8 ; @xcite ) and correlated near - ir and x - ray flux variations were found for 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite and xte  j1810@xmath0197   @xcite during their x - ray outbursts .    in the magnetar model , optical /",
    "ir emission is probably due to non - thermal radiation by particles in the magnetosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , using the _ spitzer space telescope _ , @xcite recently identified 4u  0142@xmath661 at the mid - ir wavelengths 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m .",
    "the emission in the mid - ir was brighter than that in the near - ir , and can be interpreted as dust emission from an x - ray heated passive disk around the young pulsar . given the similar near - ir fluxes of axps , this suggests that axps could all be bright at mid - ir wavelengths , due to non - thermal emission from their magnetospheres or the existence of surrounding disks .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the _ spitzer _  observations of the axps 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , and xte  j1810@xmath0197 .",
    "the general properties of these three axps are summarized in table  [ tab : axp ] .",
    "we present mid - ir observations in   [ sec : obs ] and our results in   [ sec : res ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of our observations in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "the fields of three axps were observed with _ spitzer _ using the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) and multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; @xcite ) , as part of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) instrument team guaranteed time program .",
    "a summary of the _ spitzer _",
    "observations is given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "irac is an imaging camera operating in four channels at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m .",
    "two adjacent fields are simultaneously imaged in pairs ( 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath1 m ; 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "we observed our targets in the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m channels , with bandwidths of 1.0 and 2.9 @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "the detectors at the short and long wavelengths are insb and si : as devices , respectively , with 256@xmath3256 pixels and a plate scale of 12 , giving a field of view ( fov ) of 52@xmath352 .",
    "the frame time was 100 s , with 96.8 s effective exposure time per frame for the 4.5 @xmath1 m data and 93.6 s effective exposure time for the 8.0 @xmath1 m data .",
    "the total exposures of each target s field are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the data were processed through the data reduction pipelines ( version s14.0.0 ; irac data handbook , version 3.0 , 2006 ) at the _ spitzer _ science center . in the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) pipeline ,",
    "the individual flux - calibrated frames were produced from the raw images .",
    "the bcd frames were then combined into the post - bcd ( pbcd ) mosaics .",
    "the pointing of the irac frames is typically accurate to 05 . because the fields of the axps are crowded , we further astrometrically calibrated the pbcd images to achieve the best positional accuracy and avoid source confusion . for the 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , and xte  j1810@xmath0197   images , 261 , 230 , and 100 two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) stars , detected by each of the 4.5 @xmath1 m images ,",
    "were used for the calibrations , respectively .",
    "the nominal uncertainties of the calibrated images are dominated by the 2mass systematic uncertainty ( @xmath9015 , with respect to the international celestial reference system ) .",
    "mips contains three separate detector arrays which provide capabilities for imaging and photometry in broad bands at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath1 m .",
    "the 24 @xmath1 m camera ( having 4.7 @xmath1 m bandwidth ) was operated under the photometry and super resolution ( ph / sr ) mode for the observations .",
    "the detector is a 128@xmath3128 pixel si : as array , with a pixel size of 255 and a 54@xmath354 fov .",
    "the frame time used was 10-s , with 9.96-s effective exposure time per frame .",
    "the total exposure of each source , controlled by the frame time , number of frames per cycle , and number of cycles , is given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the data were processed through the mips data reduction pipelines ( version s13.2.0 ; mips data handbook , version 3.2.1 , 2006 ) at the _ spitzer _ science center .",
    "similarly to the irac data processing , a pbcd image of each target field was produced by the post - bcd pipeline from the bcd images ( see mips data handbook for details ) .",
    "in figures 13 , we show the mid - ir images of the 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , and xte  j1810@xmath0197   fields , respectively . for the first axp ,",
    "the source position is from the near - ir observation @xcite , while for the latter two , their _ chandra _   x - ray positions @xcite were used . combining the positional uncertainties on the _ spitzer _  images and the sources , the 90% confidence radii of the error circles for the axps are at 0507 . in each figure , the source position",
    "is indicated by a cross ( the error circles are too small to be resolved on the images ) .",
    "no objects were found within the error circle of each source position on the _ spitzer _   images .",
    "there is one faint object near the position of 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , but it is 18 ( or more than 4@xmath10 ) away from the _ chandra _   position .",
    "the sensitivity of the irac observations is dominated by background sky emission and confusion noise when a field is crowded .",
    "the sky brightnesses measured by irac and mips at our target positions are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "as can be seen , 1e  1048.1@xmath05937   has a background between medium to high ( e.g. , at 8 @xmath1 m , the sky brightness is between 7.718.3 mjy / sr ) .",
    "the backgrounds of the other two axps are much higher than the high background defined by _ spitzer _ , presumably because of their crowded fields .",
    "we derived the 3@xmath10 flux upper limits from the standard deviation of the background sky at the source positions .",
    "the upper limits are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "in addition , we note that for the two objects within the error circle of 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 which were both proposed as the possible near - ir counterpart @xcite , our irac observations would have detected the object @xmath11 , if we assume that this axp has the same mid - ir to near - ir flux ratio as that of 4u 0142 + 61 .",
    "therefore , the non - detection of 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910   in our irac images is also in favor of object b being the near - ir counterpart @xcite .",
    "as indicated by the similar @xmath7-band  to  x - ray flux ratios and the cases of correlated near - ir / x - ray flux variations ( although only seen during outbursts ) , ir emission from axps is likely connected to their x - ray emission , either via the magnetosphere or via reprocessing of x - rays by a surrounding dust disk . in the first case , as starquakes shear the external magnetic field , a plasma corona forms in the twisted magnetosphere of a magnetar @xcite . the observed blackbody component ( @xmath12 kev )",
    "arises from the atmosphere of this magnetar , which would be partly heated by particles from the corona .",
    "the 210 kev power - law component is produced by multiple cyclotron scattering of the kev tail of the blackbody by coronal particles .",
    "the observed optical / ir emission is probably related to the x - rays , as it may be due to cyclotron or curvature radiation by the particles in the corona @xcite",
    ". however , currently there is no detailed theoretical model to explain the similar near - ir / x - ray flux ratios in the magnetosphere picture .",
    "alternatively , the ir and x - ray emission may be connected by a dust disk @xcite .",
    "the putative disks would have formed from fallback of supernova material @xcite .",
    "similar to an accretion disk in x - ray binaries , the dust disk is heated by the strong x - rays from the central neutron star , but since it is farther away from the central source and cooler than an accretion disk ( e.g. , see @xcite for the accretion disk model that was previously considered for the optical emission from 4u 0142@xmath661 ) , it emits mainly in the ir @xcite . using _",
    "spitzer_/irac observations similar to those discussed here , the unabsorbed ir  to  x - ray flux ratio of 4u 0142 + 61 was found to have a maximum value of @xmath133.4@xmath8 at 4.5 @xmath1 m ( here @xmath14 is phase - averaged in the 210 kev range , @xmath15 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath16 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this ratio , as it depends largely on the geometry of the disk and not on the peculiarities of the central object , might be typical for all dust disks around young neutron stars .",
    "thus , as a first - order hypothesis for either case , it is not unreasonable to assume that the ratio is constant from source to source , and see whether the data support this hypothesis .    in figure  [ fig : lim ] , we show the upper limits on the mid - ir 4.5 @xmath1 m to x - ray unabsorbed flux ratios of the three target axps and compare them to the same ratio for 4u 0142 + 61 .",
    "the unabsorbed x - ray fluxes we use are given in table  [ tab : axp ] .",
    "depending on the models used in spectral fitting , the resulting flux in the soft 0.52 kev range of the axps can be different by a factor of 23 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore use the 210 kev unabsorbed flux , which does not change significantly for different fitting models , for comparison . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "all the upper limits are above the ratio of 4u 0142 + 61 .",
    "( this is also true when the 0.510 kev x - ray fluxes are used for the comparison . )",
    "the non - detection of the sources in the mid - ir , partly because of the relatively low sensitivity limits of the _ spitzer _   observations ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) , could be due to their relatively low x - ray fluxes .",
    "our mid - ir upper limits on xte  j1810@xmath0197   set a constraint on its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "its radio spectrum was found to be harder ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) than that of most pulsars ( @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : j18 ] , we show our dereddened upper limits with the reported fluxes from radio to x - ray energies .",
    "we used @xmath21 , derived from its @xmath22 @xmath16 @xcite by using @xmath23 @xmath24 @xcite , to deredden the irac data and mips datum ( according to the reddening laws of @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "as can be seen , the rising radio spectrum of the source ( @xmath25 , estimated from the radio fluxes measured nearly simultaneously ) is constrained by the 4.5 @xmath1 m upper limit : a spectral break is thus expected to be between 4.2@xmath310@xmath26 and 6@xmath3@xmath27 hz . in addition , more recently , a flux density of 1.2 mjy at 144 ghz ( corresponding to 1.7@xmath310@xmath28 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath17 ) from the source was reported ( camilo et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this measurement further narrows the spectral break range , and may suggest a harder spectrum ( e.g. , @xmath29 ) .",
    "however , since the axp is highly variable in every spectral window where it has been observed and the measurements at the different frequency ranges in figure  [ fig : j18 ] were not simultaneously obtained , the overall shape of the sed may still be highly uncertain .",
    "it is not clear whether or not the radio emission is closely related to the observed near - ir emission ( see figure  [ fig : j18 ] ) . even in the magnetar model , the optical / ir emission would arise from the corona of the magnetar , which is located at the closed magnetosphere region .",
    "based on the rising radio energy spectrum , deeper observations at @xmath3024  @xmath1 m wavelengths , with a sensitivity comparable to the upper limit at 4.5 @xmath1 m , are required to probe whether there is radio - related ir emission from this source . a non - detection , on the other hand ,",
    "would further constrain the frequency range for the spectral break .",
    "we thank david kaplan and wynn ho for useful discussions .",
