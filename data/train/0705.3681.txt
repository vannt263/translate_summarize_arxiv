    "the study of the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies in clusters is important to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies . for example , a testable prediction of standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) hierarchical clustering models is a steep mass function resulting from the presence of a large number of faint dwarf galaxies , a fossil record of small dark matter halo formation in the early universe ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the lf is defined as the number density of galaxies per unit luminosity , and can be used to directly measure the abundances of various galaxy populations in different environments ( e.g. @xcite ) . in clusters",
    ", it can generally be described by a schechter function @xcite , with the bright end ( m@xmath12 -18 ) dominated by giant elliptical galaxies , and the faint end ( m@xmath13 -18 ) dominated by red dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of nearby clusters allow us to probe the faint end of the lf in detail , and there is now substantial evidence that clusters contain significantly higher numbers of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies than are found in the field ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although it seems that the most massive galaxies in clusters formed at early times ( @xmath14 ) , it is not known whether dwarf galaxies also formed early - on within the cluster or whether they were accreted from the field at lower redshifts ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "there is , however , growing evidence from infrared ( ir ) lf studies in support of the latter scenario ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is further supported by studies of the spatial distribution and radial velocities of des in the virgo cluster @xcite , where it was found that the cluster dwarf population probably originated as field spiral galaxies that were accreted and transformed into des by the process of ` galaxy harassment ' @xcite .",
    "we may therefore expect to see measurable differences between the dwarf populations in outer regions of clusters ( where field galaxies are accreted ) and the denser central regions , where destructive environmental factors also come into play ( see   [ sec : environ ] ) .",
    "faint populations attached to infalling galaxy groups may also increase dwarf galaxy densities in clusters , although they would be more susceptible to tidal stripping than brighter group galaxies and may therefore be expected to be located preferentially away from the core of the cluster @xcite .",
    "it is possible to directly search for such environmental differences by observing different regions within a cluster and constructing region - specific lfs in a consistent fashion .    at a redshift of @xmath16 , coma ( abell  1656 )",
    "is one of the most extensively studied clusters ( see @xcite for a historical review ) , and its richness and proximity make it an ideal target for the study of the faint - end lf .",
    "it is approximately spherically symmetric , and has two central dominant elliptical galaxies ( ngc  4874 & ngc  4889 ) .",
    "although once thought to be fully relaxed , several sub - structures have been found at optical and x - ray wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one is centered on the central galaxy ngc  4874 , another on a sub - group of galaxies around the giant elliptical ngc  4839 , located 40  south - west of the center .",
    "recent x - ray observations with _ xmm - newton _ have shown the ngc  4839 sub - group to be falling into the cluster core @xcite .",
    "an accurate determination of the faint - end slope of the lf of the coma cluster is an essential step towards constraining the mass function of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "numerous studies , mainly at optical wavelengths , have measured steep faint - end slopes ( @xmath17 to @xmath18 , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while others see a fairly flat distribution ( e.g. @xmath19 , @xcite ) .",
    "these discrepancies are likely , however , to be due to both the different photometric limits of the surveys and the different methods of subtracting the background galaxy component ( see   [ sec : compare_other ] ) .",
    "in this paper we aim to improve the determination of the dwarf galaxy population of coma by measuring its near - ir ( 3.6@xmath2 m ) lf in two regions of different densities with the infrared array camera ( irac , @xcite ) on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "observations in the near - ir provide us with a different perspective on the cluster lf to that at shorter wavelengths , as we observe emission from old stellar populations as opposed to the younger populations detected in the optical .",
    "the near - ir is therefore less sensitive to star - formation in galaxies and provides a more direct measure of the underlying galaxy mass function of the cluster . also , near - ir measurements are relatively free of biases due to dust obscuration , which means we have the potential to detect low - luminosity dusty galaxies that could be missed in optical surveys . in the past ,",
    "the small field - of - view ( fov ) of ground - based near - ir detectors has made extensive surveys of nearby clusters difficult .",
    "however , irac efficiently mosaics large areas of the sky , and has both sufficient spatial resolution ( @xmath20 ) _ and _ sensitivity to perform such a survey . in the shortest wavelength irac band ( 3.6@xmath2 m ) , the ir zodiacal light is at a minimum of @xmath123.5 mag arcsec@xmath21 @xcite , a factor of 10,000 lower than ground - based @xmath22-band imaging ( @xmath113.5 mag arcsec@xmath21 , @xcite ) .",
    "the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the irac 3.6@xmath2 m observations , together with a redshift - based statistical background source subtraction , foreground star subtraction based on galaxy star counts , and conservative optical color filters to guard against background galaxies , will allow us to make a better determination of the size of the dwarf galaxy population of coma . a well established 3.6@xmath2 m lf at @xmath23",
    "can then be compared with rest - frame 3.6@xmath2 m lfs at higher redshifts derived from other irac channels .",
    "for example , 8@xmath2 m irac observations sample 3.6@xmath2 m emission at @xmath24 , which means we could study the equivalent near - ir lf ( i.e. the mass function of galaxies ) at this redshift to see how massive clusters evolve .",
    "in   [ sec : obs ] we describe the _ spitzer _ irac observations and data reduction procedures . in   [ sec : sources ] we describe our source detection and photometry , and methods used to separate stars from galaxies . in ",
    "[ sec : optical_survey ] we outline the optical photometric / spectroscopic surveys we use to identify coma member galaxies , and in   [ sec : members ] we determine what fraction of irac detected galaxies are members of coma . in   [ sec : lf ] we construct irac lfs for both the core and off - center fields .",
    "the results are discussed in   [ sec : disc ] and compared with those found at other wavelengths .",
    "conclusions are given in ",

    "we use a distance modulus ( dm ) of @xmath25 mag , corresponding to a distance to coma of 100mpc for @xmath26=70 km s@xmath27 mpc@xmath27 .",
    "the coma cluster is approximately spherically symmetric , with a virial radius of 100  ( 2.9mpc ) and total mass , estimated from dynamical modeling , of 1.4@xmath28m@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to characterize the near - ir dwarf galaxy population of coma , and to investigate whether the lf changes , due to e.g. accretion of field dwarf galaxies / environmental factors , between regions of different cluster - centric radius and density .",
    "we select two regions of coma to overlap with the spectroscopic survey performed by @xcite ; these are shown in figure  [ fig : dss ] .",
    "the optical fields are each @xmath30508 ; one is located at the core ( coma 1 , centered at 12@xmath3159@xmath32237 , + 2801125 ) , and the second south - west of the core ( coma 3 , centered at 12@xmath3157@xmath32075 , + 2711130 ) .",
    "these two fields were chosen firstly because of their large density contrasts ( the local density of coma 3 is somewhere between coma 1 and the field ) , and secondly because the coma 3 field covers the x - ray secondary peak ( the giant elliptical galaxy ngc  4839 ) .",
    "we refer to coma 1 and coma 3 as the ` core ' and ` off - center ' fields respectively .",
    "the center of the coma 3 field is located @xmath157  ( 1.7mpc ) from the established central galaxy ngc  4874 @xcite , i.e. @xmath10.6 times the virial radius .      the coma 3 off - center field was observed by _",
    "spitzer _ on june 13 , 2005 ( program i d 3521 ) .",
    "the observation consists of two pointings designed to cover as much of the coma 3 field as possible .",
    "aor 11067904 ( top ) is centered on 12@xmath3157@xmath32250 , + 2722130 , while aor 11067648 ( bottom ) is centered on 12@xmath3157@xmath32250 , + 2658130 , the two fields overlapping in the middle .",
    "each pointing is made up of an 8@xmath339 grid of 72s per pixel exposures , dithered over 6 positions with a medium scale cycling pattern to fully sample the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "since there are a few moderately bright sources in the field , the high dynamic range full array mode was used , which includes some very short exposures ( 0.6s ) to aid photometry and psf fitting of saturated sources . note that these short exposures are not used when combining the images ( see   [ sec : irac_images ] ) , as this would result in higher background noise and decreased sensitivity .",
    "to study the coma 1 core field , we use archival data taken on the core of the coma cluster .",
    "these data , gathered by the irac instrument team in july 2004 ( program i d 25 , p.i .",
    "fazio ) , are centered on 12@xmath3159@xmath32487 , + 2758500 and are slightly deeper than the coma 3 off - center data ( 90s per pixel ) .",
    "this observation is comprised of two 12@xmath336 grids ( aors 3859712 & 3859968 ) taken in standard full array mode , dithered over 3 positions with a small cycling pattern .",
    "the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) were supplied by the _ spitzer science center _ ( ssc ) , consisting of individual calibrated frames .",
    "the pipeline processing steps performed to produce these data were dark subtraction , flat fielding and flux calibration ( see the irac data handbook for further details ) .",
    "we performed post - bcd processing on the go and archival data in the following manner .",
    "the individual images were mosaiced together using the ssc s data processing package , mopex , specifying a standard pixel size of 1.22 . in order to exactly align the images of the 4 irac bands , fiducial image frames ( fifs ) were created for each observation using all bcd images in that observation and applied to the mosaicing of each individual band image .",
    "a full mosaic of the two fields is shown in figure  [ fig : irac_mosaic ] .",
    "the images are flux calibrated in the ssc pipeline in surface brightness units ( mjy  sr@xmath27 ) . for the purposes of determining individual source fluxes ( see   [ sec : sourcedetect ] ) , the images were converted to flux density units by multiplying by a conversion factor of 1mjy  sr@xmath27 = 34.98@xmath2jy per pixel .",
    "this is a combination of the conversion given in the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "observers manual ( 1mjy  sr@xmath27 = 23.50443 @xmath2jy arcsec@xmath21 ) , and the pixel solid angle ( 1.22 arcsec@xmath0 , since the flux density of an object is the integral of the surface brightness over its solid angle ) .",
    "source detection was carried out with the sextractor ( se ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the se detection threshold was set to 3@xmath34 , with the seeing_fwhm parameter fixed to 1.7  to match the irac 3.6@xmath2 m psf full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm , see table  3 , @xcite ) . only sources within the areas observed in all four irac bands were included , to be able to calculate irac colors for every source .",
    "we used the ` double - image ' mode in se , detecting objects in the image with the highest signal - to - noise ( 3.6@xmath2 m ) .",
    "this provides photometry on 4 irac bands , and allows a consistent measure of irac colors .",
    "the total areas analyzed in each field were 0.733 deg@xmath0 ( coma 1 ) and 0.555 deg@xmath0 ( coma 3 ) .",
    "we measured ` total ' fluxes using flexible elliptical apertures ( i.e. flux_auto in se ) , whose elongation and position angle are defined by the object s light distribution , and therefore proportional to the size of each galaxy in the image @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "swire team has found that this is the best approach for measuring the flux from small ( a few arcsecond size ) extended sources ( see section 5.8 in the irac data handbook v.3 ) .",
    "the auto elliptical apertures were set to 2.5 times the characteristic ` kron ' radius of each source , so that they contain @xmath35 95% of source flux @xcite .",
    "since the coma field is dense , the local background was subtracted using a 5 pixel radius annulus around each source to mitigate contamination from nearby sources .",
    "the measured flux densities were then converted to apparent magnitudes using the flux density zero points ( relative to vega ) quoted in @xcite ; these are 280.9jy ( 3.6@xmath2 m ) , 179.7jy ( 4.5@xmath2 m ) , 115.0jy ( 5.8@xmath2 m ) and 64.13jy ( 8@xmath2 m ) .",
    "finally , the images and source detections were visually inspected .",
    "spurious sources ( e.g. those in the trails of very bright stars ) were removed .",
    "the irac catalog , which will be published separately , contains four - band data for a total of 29,208 sources , 17,872 in coma 1 and 11,336 in coma 3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sensitivity ] shows the flux density distribution of the sources detected in both fields .",
    "these turn over due to the onset of incompleteness at @xmath36jy ( m@xmath118.2 ) in the coma 1 core field and @xmath37jy ( m@xmath117.8 ) in the coma 3 off - center field at 3.6@xmath2 m ( shown with vertical lines ) .",
    "however , to guard against any minor effects of incompleteness at brighter magnitudes , we adopt more conservative completeness limits of m@xmath38 and 16.5 ( corresponding to m@xmath39 -18 and -18.5 ) for coma 1 and 3 respectively for our lf calculations ( see   [ sec : lf ] ) .    to give an insight into the different galaxy populations in coma , figure  [ fig : irac_colors ] shows an irac color - color diagram ( 5.8/3.6@xmath2 m vs 8.0/4.5@xmath2 m ) for the spectroscopically confirmed bright ( m@xmath40 ) and faint ( @xmath41 m@xmath42 ) members in the two fields ( see   [ sec : members ] for member identification ) .",
    "this combination of colors is a good indicator of star - formation activity in galaxies ( i.e. ratios of pah features to stellar light ) .",
    "the four areas denote the expected colors for pah - dominated ( star - forming ) , stellar - dominated ( passive ) and continuum - dominated ( active ; agn ) galaxies in the four irac bands at zero redshift , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "this shows that the majority of the coma members have colors consistent with those of passive stellar galaxies , as expected for such a massive cluster .",
    "another population have colors consistent with agn , which can be confirmed by follow - up x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. note that the bright members are skewed towards the passive galaxy colors , while the faint members randomly populate the color - color space .      according to the irac source number counts of @xcite , a substantial fraction of sources in the irac bands , particularly at bright magnitudes , are foreground galactic stars . in order to reliably measure the number of galaxies in the data ,",
    "it is important to filter these out . at the brightest magnitudes in our catalog ( m@xmath43 )",
    ", we can use the spatial extent of galaxies at 3.6@xmath2 m to morphologically separate them from stars .",
    "here we use the method described in @xcite and @xcite , which uses the difference between small 3  diameter circular aperture and ` auto ' aperture flux measurements in se as a ` concentration parameter ' . in this scheme , which is reliable down to m@xmath4414.5 @xcite",
    ", point sources will have approximately the same magnitude using both ` auto ' and circular ( corrected ) apertures , whereas galaxies will show an excess in the corrected circular aperture because their emission does not match the irac psf profile .",
    "figure  [ fig : starconc ] illustrates the concentration parameter , showing the boundaries defined by @xcite to separate stars from galaxies .",
    "sources with values of the se parameter class_star @xmath45 0.95 are also shown ( where values close to 1 represent point sources ) , demonstrating that these sources do indeed fall inside the designated ranges .",
    "an aperture correction of -0.69 mag was derived from the data to correct the 3  aperture magnitudes out to the irac total magnitude calibration diameter of 24.4  ( 20 pixels ) .",
    "this is defined , in terms of flux , as the average ratio ( 1.90 ) of the 24.4  to 3  aperture measurements from se on 56 unsaturated stars ( 9 @xmath46 m@xmath47 12 ) using a 5 pixel - wide background annulus ( this magnitude range excludes the few brightest stars that are obviously saturated ) . note that this small aperture size does not provide a reliable measurement of the total fluxes of galaxies , but it is useful for the purpose of star - galaxy separation .",
    "all sources satisfying the criterion -0.25",
    "@xmath46 m@xmath48 ( 3 ) ",
    "m@xmath48 ( auto ) @xmath46 0.2 and brighter than 14.5 mag were flagged as possible stars .",
    "these were all inspected visually , and 7 were re - classified as galaxies based on their irac morphology . as an additional check ,",
    "the positions of the sources classified as stars were cross - matched with the optical photometric catalog of @xcite ( which has also had the stars removed by a similar method ) using a 3@xmath34 matching radius of 4.24  ( see   [ sec : members ] ) , and only 4 sources were reclassified as galaxies based on these matches .",
    "the 4 brightest stars in these fields were also classified as galaxies by their concentration parameter due to the bright wings of their psfs , and these were subsequently re - classified as stars after visual inspection of the data . in total ,",
    "476 bright sources ( m@xmath43 ) were classified as stars over the two fields , and removed from the lf calculations .",
    "we also removed 2100 sources with m@xmath48 ( 3 ) ",
    "m@xmath48 ( auto ) @xmath46 - 0.25 fainter than 14.5 mag as these are almost certainly cosmic rays @xcite .    at fainter magnitudes ( m@xmath49 14.5 )",
    ", it is difficult to distinguish stars from galaxies morphologically , so we must subtract the stellar contribution using statistical methods .",
    "here we use the  dirbe ( diffuse infrared background experiment ) faint source model \" for galactic stars , which is an implementation of the @xcite statistical model ( further details can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : starcounts ] shows the differential number counts of the two coma datasets , together with the predicted model counts for galactic stars in the dirbe 3.5@xmath2 m band for the line - of - sight towards coma ( galactic coordinates : @xmath50 , r. arendt , _ private communication _ ) .",
    "the model demonstrates the dominance of stars at bright magnitudes ( 8 @xmath46 m@xmath47 14 ) . however , the counts in the central coma 1 field are well above the star counts from as bright as m@xmath51 due to the high number of bright galaxies located there , whereas the counts in the off - center field do not diverge significantly from the model until m@xmath52 .",
    "fainter than m@xmath53 , there is a much smaller stellar contribution to the total number counts ( @xmath11015% ) , and we subtract the model star counts from our data in this range for our lf calculations in   [ sec : lf ] .      in figure",
    "[ fig : galcounts ] ( a ) we plot the coma galaxy number counts ( excluding all contributions from stars ) together with the field galaxy number counts of @xcite .",
    "these consist of observations from 3 fields : qso 1700 ( @xmath54 ) , extended groth strip ( egs ) ( @xmath55 ) and botes ( @xmath56 ) . for magnitudes brighter than 15 mag",
    ", we use the wide - area botes field counts ; fainter than this we use the average of the counts from the deeper qso 1700 and egs survey fields ( taken from table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this figure shows that there is a clear excess of galaxies in both coma fields at bright magnitudes ( m@xmath57 14.5 ) as expected , but it also indicates an excess at fainter magnitudes . to illustrate this more clearly , figure  [ fig : galcounts ] ( b ) shows the ratio of galaxy counts in the two coma fields to the field counts in the range 14.5 @xmath46 m@xmath58 17 .",
    "even taking possible cosmic field - to - field variations into account ( estimated as 16 - 19% over 1100 arcmin@xmath0 by @xcite , similar to the egs deep survey area of 1224 arcmin@xmath0 ) , the excess is still above the highest background count estimate .",
    "note , however , that since we know that there is significant background structure behind coma , we do not use statistical background source subtraction for the lfs in this study .",
    "instead , we use spectroscopic membership fractions together with optical color selection to subtract the background galaxy component ( see   [ sec : members ] &   [ sec : colors ] ) .",
    "to determine the contribution to the overall lf from background galaxies , we use redshift information from two optical catalogs .",
    "the first is the spectroscopic survey of @xcite , based on the william herschel telescope ( wht ) wide - field photometric @xmath9- and @xmath10-band ccd survey of five fields in the coma cluster by @xcite . in brief ,",
    "two of the photometric survey fields , each 325@xmath33508 , were chosen for follow - up spectroscopic observations using the wyffos multi - fiber spectrograph on the wht ; coma 1 ( core ) , centered on 12@xmath3159@xmath32237 , + 2801125 , and coma 3 ( off - center ) , centered on 12@xmath3157@xmath32075 , + 2711130 . in this survey , redshifts were measured for two classes of galaxies in coma : the `` bright '' sample , consisting of galaxies already confirmed as spectroscopic members with previously measured redshifts , and a `` faint '' sample of galaxies with no known redshifts , which were on average fainter than the bright sample .",
    "the faint sample was chosen from the photometric data using their positions in the color - magnitude plane ( @xmath59 versus @xmath10 with the criterion 17.5 @xmath60 20 ( designed to include the dwarf galaxy population ) and 1 @xmath61 2 ( to eliminate the majority of background galaxies ) .",
    "we supplement this with a wider - field ( 2.63 deg@xmath0 ) but shallower ( @xmath62 ) catalog compiled by m. colless ( _ private communication _ ) , to ensure the inclusion of previously - studied brighter galaxies in the cluster that were not re - measured in the @xcite study .",

    "@xcite have also demonstrated that such projection effects , resulting from large - scale structure behind clusters , can produce artificially steep faint - end slopes ( @xmath165 ) .    in this study , we have spectroscopic information for the entire 3.6@xmath2 m magnitude range of the lf , which gives a more reliable estimate of the faint - end slope in our data . for comparison , however , we have constructed a field - subtracted lf using the field counts of @xcite , which is shown in figure  [ fig : lf_all ] ( _ lower right _ ) .",
    "although not well constrained , it is consistent in almost all bins with the lf computed using the spectroscopic membership fraction within the combined poissonian errors .",
    "the faint end of the field - subtracted lf will be very uncertain due to the smaller size of the egs control field ( 1224 arcmin@xmath0 ) , but importantly we demonstrate that the steep upturn is present in the data regardless of the background subtraction method .",
    "the majority of coma lf studies have been carried out at optical wavelengths ( see   [ sec : compare_other ] ) .",
    "however , our 3.6@xmath2 m lfs are more directly comparable with near - ir lfs at the slightly shorter wavelengths of @xmath152 ( 1.6@xmath2 m ) and @xmath22 ( 2.2@xmath2 m ) as they also probe the stellar mass of the galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : survey_compare ] summarizes the properties of this and previous near - ir surveys , and demonstrates that the irac survey covers a previously unexplored regime of a large surface area combined with good photometric depth .",
    "the first @xmath22-band coma lf was measured by @xcite for a small 41 arcmin@xmath0 area in the core down to @xmath166 .",
    "this lf was not well constrained ( @xmath167 with m@xmath168 fixed at -24.35 ) due to large uncertainties in the background source subtraction , but the faint galaxies were shown to be dwarf spheroidals by their optical - ir colors .",
    "a better comparison comes from the larger area ( 660 arcmin@xmath0 ) @xmath152-band study of the core region by @xcite , where the shape of the lf ( down to @xmath169 ) is similar in many ways to the 3.6@xmath2 m lf presented here .",
    "the statistics ( @xmath1200 galaxies compared to only @xmath1 40 in the @xcite study ) allowed better constraints on the parameters , and the bright end was fitted with a schechter function with @xmath170 and m@xmath171 ( for dm = 35.0 ) .",
    "note that @xcite also found evidence of an excess of galaxies fainter than @xmath172 mag ; using two different background subtraction methods ( statistical field subtraction and @xmath162 color selection ) , they measured a power - law slope of @xmath173 .",
    "another @xmath152-band study by @xcite covered a smaller area ( 480 arcmin@xmath0 ) @xmath115  north - east from the cluster center , and reached one magnitude deeper ( @xmath174 ) than @xcite .",
    "this @xmath152-band lf was fitted with a single schechter function with a slope of @xmath175 and m@xmath176 ( for dm = 35.0 ) , but again was not well - constrained .",
    "a dip was also seen at m@xmath177 , which is also present in both fields in the 3.6@xmath2 m lfs and in the @xcite @xmath152-band data .",
    "we also see another shallow dip in the irac data in both fields at m@xmath178 .",
    "these dips have been seen in optical surveys of coma ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and are thought to be a result of the merging and disappearance of bright elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "all of these near - ir lfs have relatively flat faint - end slopes , similar to the irac 3.6@xmath2 m lf when fitted by a schechter function over the range @xmath86 m@xmath179 .",
    "however , apart from the @xcite @xmath152-band study , they do not show evidence of the excess population of faint ( m@xmath180 ) galaxies seen here .",
    "this is likely to be a direct consequence of the increased sensitivity of irac ( i.e. darker sky ) , permitting much better statistics compared to the ground - based instruments ( see   [ sec : intro ] ) . the vastly lower sky background level at 3.6@xmath2 m will also increase detection of low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) dwarf galaxies that may have been missed in the ground - based surveys .",
    "recently , there has also been a longer - wavelength _",
    "multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) 24@xmath2 m study of the coma lf @xcite .",
    "however , due to the larger psf of mips ( 6  fwhm ) , it is much more prone to confusion issues in crowded fields like coma and can not therefore go as deep as irac .",

    "these results are consistent with the 3.6@xmath2 m bright - end slopes in the two fields , within the combined errors .",

    "[ sec : fieldcounts ] , in addition to the obvious excess at bright magnitudes , there is also a significant excess of galaxies in coma compared with 3.6@xmath2 m field galaxy counts of @xcite at faint magnitudes ( m@xmath100 ) , the position of the coma upturn ( see figure  [ fig : galcounts ] ) .",
    "recent determinations of field @xmath22-band lfs are deep enough to compare with coma ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and they are all consistent with a flat faint - end slope for the lf ( @xmath185 -1.0 to -1.3 ) out to redshifts of @xmath186 .",
    "a 3.6@xmath2 m field lf has also been published by @xcite for the _ spitzer _ swire survey , which is deeper than our coma survey ( m@xmath18219.5 ) .",
    "this also shows a flat faint - end slope , with @xmath185 -0.9 to -1.0 over the redshift range @xmath164 0 to 1.5 .",
    "the excess of galaxies detected in coma with respect to 3.6@xmath2 m field galaxy counts , together with relatively flat slopes of near - ir field lfs extending beyond the depth of our irac coma sample , support the evidence that the large dwarf population detected at 3.6@xmath2 m is not an artifact of incorrect background source subtraction , and that they do indeed belong to coma .",
    "the optical lf studies of coma are deep enough to reach the dwarf galaxy population , and a wide range of faint - end slopes have been measured ( @xmath185 -1.0 to -1.8 , see table  [ tab : lfsummary ] , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a more recent hst @xmath10-band study measures an even steeper slope of -2.3 in a small 5 arcmin@xmath0 core region @xcite .",
    "we can _ qualitatively _ compare the 3.6@xmath2 m lf to the @xmath10 and @xmath9-band optical lfs of @xcite , as the background subtraction was also performed using spectroscopic membership fractions . to translate the optical lfs to their expected magnitudes at 3.6@xmath2 m , we compute mean optical - ir colors of the spectroscopically confirmed members to be @xmath10 - 3.6@xmath2 m @xmath1 2.7 and @xmath9 - 3.6@xmath2 m @xmath1 4.2 for all galaxies ( without regard to galaxy classification ) .",
    "however , due to the known luminosity / galaxy type segregation in clusters , the corrections will not be uniform across all magnitude bins . in order to match the optical and 3.6@xmath2 m lfs more accurately",
    ", we derive the mean @xmath187 m and @xmath188 m colors of the confirmed members in half - magnitude bins , corresponding to the binning of the optical and ir data .",
    "figure  [ fig : lf_compare ] shows the combined ( coma 1 + coma 3 ) 3.6@xmath2 m lf , together with the equivalent @xmath10- and @xmath9-band lfs of @xcite shifted by the mean @xmath187 m and @xmath188 m colors .",
    "also shown is the range of stellar masses covered by the irac observations , which are estimated as @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the 3.6@xmath2 m flux density in @xmath2jy .",
    "this is calculated using a distance of 100mpc and a @xmath22-band mass - to - light ratio of 0.91 at @xmath191 @xcite , after transforming the 3.6@xmath2 m flux densities to @xmath22-band using the _ spitzer _ ex - pet tool , assuming an elliptical sed .",
    "the bright - ends of the lfs agree well , which is to be expected as we are sampling almost the same galaxy populations .",
    "however , fainter than m@xmath44 - 20.5 , the shapes differ significantly , with the irac lf having a much steeper slope than the optical lfs . at the faint end ,",
    "we show both the raw 3.6@xmath2 m lf ( with no optical selection ) and the two @xmath92 color - cut lfs , illustrating that the ir - excess is still significant with these constraints .",
    "it is , however , important to note that while one can compare the _ shapes _ of the optical and irac lfs , a comparison of their relative normalizations may be misleading .",
    "a possible explanation for the difference between the optical and ir lfs is that the apparent excess of faint ir - detected galaxies may represent either a lsb dwarf population that irac is more sensitive to , or a population of dwarf galaxies that are too red to be detected in @xcite down to the optical limit of @xmath68 ( or a combination of both ) .    however , there are many other optical surveys that probe much deeper into the dwarf population , which , by necessity , use statistical background source subtraction ( e.g. @xcite ( @xmath192 ) , @xcite ( @xmath193 ) and @xcite ( @xmath193 ) ) .",
    "the optical color - cuts we impose on our 3.6@xmath2 m faint - end lfs means that we do not include any optically undetected galaxies .",
    "however , the sdss catalog only reaches @xmath63 , so in terms of @xmath93-band magnitude , this cut may be overly - conservative",
    ". there could be additional irac - detected dwarfs that are optically fainter than this , and indeed the deeper optical studies already show evidence of such faint populations .",
    "for example , the @xmath10-band membership fraction of @xcite implies a flat lf slope out to @xmath68 , but the deeper @xmath10-band lfs of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite all continue to rise beyond this with slopes of @xmath185 -1.4 to -1.7",
    ". this may therefore be the @xmath10-band regime where the excess 3.6@xmath2 m dwarf galaxy population is detectable , and suggests that this near - ir survey may manifest this population . to investigate this further ,",
    "we have cross - correlated the coma 1 irac catalog with the deep @xcite optical catalog over an area of 1365 arcmin@xmath0 in the central region common to both surveys .",
    "we find that @xmath193% of the faint 3.6@xmath2 m sources ( m@xmath100 ) have optical matches down to @xmath194 .",
    "these results imply that the faint ir population has much redder optical / ir colors compared to the optically selected dwarfs in the cluster .",
    "since we have used membership fractions to construct the lf , we have not yet identified which _ particular _ galaxies in this population are coma members . however , in figure  [ fig : opt_ir ] we show the @xmath195 m versus 3.6@xmath2 m color - magnitude relation for the @xmath91 , @xmath90 optically - selected subset of irac - detected galaxies matched to the sdss catalog . in a similar fashion to the optical color diagram ( figure  [ fig : sdss ] ) ,",
    "the coma members form a strong red sequence at @xmath195 m  @xmath196 , but we also note an increase in redder members towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "there is also a general reddening of all galaxies at faint magnitudes ; although a fraction of these will be background galaxies , this is consistent with the suggestion that the irac - detected faint population in coma is redder than the optically - selected dwarf population .",
    "this will be explored in more detail in a future paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : alpha_compare ] shows the multi - wavelength coma faint - end lf slopes from table  [ tab : lfsummary ] plotted versus filter wavelength .",
    "although the areas and photometric depths covered by these studies vary , they can be used to investigate any broad trends in changes of the faint - end slope with wavelength . where slopes were measured in different regions of coma in a particular study ( i.e. core / off - center / total ) , only the slope of the total area lf is plotted .",
    "some evidence has previously been found for change of the faint slope between different bands ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , but no significant trend is evident in this figure .",
    "the different symbols / colors denote the different methods of background source subtraction used . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the slopes based on samples measured with a spectroscopic background subtraction appear systematically shallower ( in agreement with e.g. @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". however , the uv measurement of @xcite and @xcite , both using a similar method , are much steeper ( @xmath105 = -2.16 and -1.65 respectively ) .",
    "the 24@xmath2 m slope measured by @xcite using redshift membership fractions ( @xmath197 ) is consistent within the errors with the optical measurements using statistical background source subtraction .",
    "however , this is relatively shallower and therefore not directly comparable . a systematic study using reliable redshift background source subtraction across all wavebands",
    "is required to properly determine if there is any color evolution of the faint - end slope .",
    "note that the irac 3.6@xmath2 m slope is significantly steeper than all but one measurement in the uv @xcite and the deep hst @xmath10-band study of @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of this study is to search for changes in the shape of the faint end of the lf in different regions of coma .",
    "the shape of the lf is not thought to be universal , but strongly influenced by local environment . for instance , @xcite measure flat slopes ( @xmath198 ) in a sample of rich clusters , and find much steeper slopes in poorer clusters ( @xmath199 ) . in the central regions of clusters , processes such as tidal stripping and ram pressure stripping @xcite",
    "conspire to destroy smaller dwarf galaxies by removing their stars and gas .",
    "another destructive process that depends on cluster density is galaxy harassment @xcite , where frequent and rapid close encounters of small spiral galaxies convert them into dwarf spheroidal systems .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggest that the high temperatures present in coma during its initial formation could have suppressed the formation of dwarf galaxies in the core region .",
    "these effects point towards a scenario where the number of dwarf galaxies should decrease towards the center of the cluster , leading to a flattening of the lf faint - end slope .",
    "however there are other competing factors that come into play .",
    "the denser the environment , the more likely that dark halos of galaxies could collect gas from the inter - cluster medium to be converted into stars , leading to larger numbers of dwarf galaxies in denser evolved cores than the less - dense , unevolved off - center or field ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this could counter - balance the effects of destructive forces of tidal interactions , ram pressure stripping and harassment .",
    "we do find significant differences between slopes at the core and off - center regions of the cluster .",
    "if this directly traces the mass , then a difference in the lfs means galaxies have different formation / destruction and merger histories depending on their local environment . at the bright end ( schechter form )",
    ", the slope increases from @xmath111 = -1.18@xmath890.06 in the core to -1.30@xmath890.08 in the off - center field , while at the faint end ( power - law form ) there is an increase from @xmath8 = -2.18@xmath890.13 to -2.60@xmath890.33 ( see table  [ tab : fits ] and figure  [ fig : lf_all ] ) . additionally , m@xmath112 is fainter in coma 3 , which reflects the fact that this off - center region does not possess as many of the very bright galaxies seen in the central region .",
    "some previous studies covering sufficiently large areas of coma have also found similar changes in lf slope with environment , as shown in table  [ tab : lfsummary ] .",
    "for example , @xcite finds a @xmath123-band slope of -1.32 in the core region , but a steeper slope of -1.54 when all areas of the cluster within the survey are included .",
    "a smaller increase is also found in the @xmath93-band , with no such difference found in the @xmath9-band .",
    "a similar effect is found in the @xmath135-band by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have found significant differences in the faint - end slopes of northern and southern areas of the center of the cluster , with a steep @xmath10-band slope in the north ( -1.74 ) and a flatter slope in the south ( -1.28 ) .",
    "@xcite also find a small increase in the @xmath10-band slope between the core ( -1.17 ) and the off - center ( -1.29 ) , and @xcite found a similar effect at mid - ir wavelengths , with a slope of -0.99 in the core , increasing to -1.32 in their off - center region .",
    "collectively , these results provide strong evidence that dwarf galaxies are being destroyed or merged into larger galaxies in the denser central regions of the cluster .",
    "this scenario is further supported by evidence of disruption in the central regions of coma in the form of tidal features , resulting from galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - cluster interactions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting at this stage to compare the coma ir lf with examples at higher redshifts to study possible evolutionary trends . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath22-band lfs of 38 clusters with redshifts in the range @xmath200 were measured .",
    "although they were unable to constrain the faint - end slopes of the clusters with these data , they found that the evolution of m@xmath201 was consistent with a model where the giant early - type galaxies in the clusters formed all their stars in a single burst at high redshift ( @xmath14 ) , and evolved passively thereafter .",
    "this result was independent of the richness of the clusters .",
    "more recently , there have been two studies of the irac 3.6@xmath2 m redshift evolution of clusters . @xcite",
    "measured the 3.6@xmath2 m lfs of 123 galaxy clusters in the _ spitzer _ first look survey ( fls ) in the redshift range @xmath202 .",
    "they found that m@xmath112 evolved in a manner consistent with a passive evolution model ( in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , they also found some evidence that the faint - end slope became shallower at @xmath203 .",
    "together , these results imply similar redshifts ( @xmath14 ) for the formation of massive galaxies and clusters , with many of the dwarf galaxies accreted from the field at @xmath15 .",
    "this result is also supported by @xcite , whose @xmath204-band lf of a cluster at @xmath205 has a faint - end slope of @xmath206 , which is significantly shallower than clusters in the local universe .",
    "another study by @xcite of 32 clusters in the _ spitzer _ swire survey in the redshift range @xmath207 also found that their values of m@xmath112 were consistent with a passive evolution model , but were unable to determine any change of slope with redshift with these data .",
    "the large population of dwarf galaxies detected at 3.6@xmath2 m in coma supports the scenario of accretion of dwarf galaxies from the field at low redshift .",
    "however , our values of m@xmath112 ( -25.17@xmath890.10 for coma 1 and -24.69@xmath890.15 for coma 3 ) are slightly brighter than the value predicted by the passive evolution model of @xcite of -24.33 ( a. muzzin , _ private communication _ ) .",
    "we have conducted a wide - field _ spitzer _",
    "irac 3.6@xmath2 m survey of two fields in the coma cluster , in which we have dramatically improved constraints on the faint end of the near - ir coma lf compared to previous ir surveys . thanks to the efficiency of the irac instrument and the significantly reduced sky background in space , we have been able to probe as faint as m@xmath208 ( m@xmath209 ) over a large fraction of the cluster ( @xmath210 deg@xmath0 ) , giving a very representative view of the ir dwarf population of coma .",
    "the first of our two fields covers an area of 0.733 deg@xmath0 in the core of the cluster ( coma 1 ) , and the second is an off - center 0.555 deg@xmath0 region , @xmath157   from the core ( coma 3 ) .",
    "we detect a total of 29,208 sources , 17,872 in coma 1 and 11,336 in coma 3 .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   we construct 3.6@xmath2 m lfs for the coma 1 and coma 3 fields . to subtract the contribution to the 3.6@xmath2 m counts due to background galaxies",

    "faintward of m@xmath211 , _ we detect a steep faint - end slope in both fields_. to guard against any optical selection bias in the spectroscopic completeness functions , we use sdss photometric data to construct optically - selected 3.6@xmath2 m faint - end slopes for both fields . taking only the irac sources with optical counterparts at @xmath91 mag and cut at @xmath7 , we measure steep faint - end slopes of @xmath8 = -2.18@xmath890.13 in coma 1 and -2.60@xmath890.33 in coma 3 , which infer that there are at least @xmath115 member galaxies over the two fields .",
    "the differences in slopes between the two fields provides evidence for environmental effects .",
    "3 .   when qualitatively compared to @xmath9- and @xmath10-band optical lfs constructed from the same areas of coma and using the same spectroscopic completeness method , we find that the optical lfs have fairly flat distributions at the faint end ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the difference between the optical and ir lfs is that the excess of faint ir - detected galaxies may represent either a lsb dwarf population that irac is more sensitive to , or a population of dwarf galaxies that are too red to be detected in the optical survey down to the limit of @xmath68 ( or a combination of both ) .",

    "approximately @xmath212% of the irac sources have optical counterparts in the sdss data down to @xmath63 , and @xmath45 90% of a subset in the coma 1 field have counterparts down to @xmath194 .",
    "there is therefore great potential that the numbers of irac detected galaxies implied by our sdss optical color - cuts as belonging to coma will increase with further investigation .",

    "the current state - of - the - art in wide - field multi - object spectroscopy reaches @xmath214 in several hour exposures ( e.g. the hectospec work of @xcite ) , and so at present , statistical field subtraction must still be used fainter than this .",
