    "we apply an alternative statistical description to the methods that had been used in the articles cited above .",
    "this method is equivalently unambiguous in describing the stochastic processes .",
    "the flare rate is estimated explicitly from the waiting time pdf .",
    "such an approach has the significant advantage of linking the waiting time of the flare and its rate , which is the instantaneous probability of the flare per unit of time .",

    "flare_. then the _ flare waiting time _ is associated with a random non - negative variable @xmath0 , called _ _ failure time _ _ being the interval between adjacent _ failures _ , that is , between two flares .",

    "the constancy of @xmath28 reveals the `` no - memory '' property of the poisson stochastic process .",
    "the goes flare catalogues are analysed with particular interest in the interval between consecutive flares .",
    "the goes observations provide the longest record and complementary h@xmath1 data provided allow one to consider both @xmath0-ray  and h@xmath1  flares .",
    "the catalogued event is recorded by specifying starting time , peak time and ending time .",
    "thus , the waiting time is not unambiguously defined .",
    "we consider two definitions : the _ peak - to - peak _ ( ptp ) waiting timethe interval between times of maximum flux rate of two near - in - time flares , and the _ end - to - start _ ( ets ) waiting timethe interval between the end time of the predecessor and the starting time of the current event .",
    "the latter definition is intuitive , but might be of questionable applicability from the point of view of statistical methods that will be used ( see section  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "however , it is used in the article to demonstrate the influence of the definition of the wt  on its statistical properties .",
    "initially , the catalogue should be preprocessed to avoid errors due to data gaps .",
    "the neighbourhood events to every catalogue item marked with the data gap flags ( notably ` d ` , ` e ` ) were ignored ; thus , after filtering we have the set of @xmath29 @xmath0-ray  events ( including goes @xmath30-class events ) dating from september @xmath31 until december @xmath32 .",

    "the correlations between monthly averaged sunspots number and monthly averaged wt  in both both soft x - rays and h@xmath1 are evident and intuitive . during the solar minimum years the flare rate is lower , leading to longer wt  prevalence ; conversely , during the solar maximum years the rate is higher and thus waiting times are shorter on average .",
    "this substantial variation leads to separate consideration of the solar cycle phases according to corresponding traces in the calculated wt  series . to separate phases",
    ", we consider the time derivative of the monthly average sunspot number @xmath34 .",
    "the qualitative agreement ( in figure  [ fig.1 ] is shown by grey lines ) in the fluctuations of wt  and @xmath35 is attained empirically , by considering intervals with limited fluctuations in @xmath36 around the corresponding zeros , to be less than @xmath37 for the minima phases and less than @xmath38 for the maxima .",
    "figures  [ fig.2]-[fig.4 ] show a pdf  of waiting times for joint solar cycle phases , solar minimum and maximum , respectively , by means of the two wt  definitions mentioned above .",
    "the solid line in each panel stands for the reference exponential distribution @xmath39 , with the average @xmath40 estimated from the series whose pdf  is shown by the scatter plot . to some extent , the similarity with the pure exponential is attained in a single case only ( the bottom panel in figure  [ fig.4 ] ) .",
    "the density shapes are similar within a given wt  definition . remarkably , the variation in wt  definition affects the most probable events : the bell - like pdf  versus plateau - like over almost @xmath41 decades .    the plots in figure  [ fig.2 ] should be interpreted as power - laws according to . however , the power - law fit has to be considered with special care , as the findings illustrated in the following are challenging the straightforward applicability of the power - law fit .",

    "in this section , the opposing results and interpretations existing in the literature are compared and discussed in the context of the findings reported .",
    "we shall highlight the discrepancies and agreement with those previously published by the cited authors .",
    "evidently , our results are strongly affected by the completeness and accuracy of the goes catalogue .",
    "in fact , the event detection is done in an automated way and any change in the detection algorithm would alter the statistics . furthermore , the flare event _ obscuration _ ( for details see ) brings about quite hard arguments against the reliability of any study : the missing of substantial amount of events ( up to @xmath53 for events above goes @xmath54-class ) might be so crucial that the pdf  would dramatically change its behaviour . however , our results are comparable with those based on the same datasets .    in the case of the solar minima ,",
    "the longer record is required most of all .",
    "the relatively high probability of longer wt  ( figure  [ fig.3 ] ) conceals the probability variation along the domain , since the pdf  is shrunk along the ordinate and has too wide spreading of the tail .",
    "the longer series should clarify the pdf  shape .",
    "equation  ( [ main_eq ] ) diverges as the cumulative distribution approaches values at the very tail @xmath55 and , consequently , the wide tails of the pdf  are amplified by means of the non - linear transformation given by equation  ( [ main_eq ] ) .",
    "thus , the resulting tails of the estimated rates appear to be even more scattered ( figure  [ fig.5 ] ) .",
    "this motivated us to apply a smoothing to the functions obtained , which , in turn , eliminates details and provides rather qualitative result .",
    "a random event should be defined as a point - like instance in time _",
    "i.e. _ , the event has no length . from this point of view , the _ ptp  _ definition is more mathematically adequate , rather than the _",
    "ets  _ waiting time defined by the subtraction of the flare duration from the base time line .",
    "practically , the flux maximum point is easier to detect precisely , with respect to the starting / ending times , since their flux values are closer to the background noise level .    and used the wt  defined as the difference between the times of peak flux rates of two near - in - time flares . later in the wt",
    "was defined as the difference between the start times . however , the latter definition is qualitatively coincident with what we called _",
    ". we would ignore possible numerical discrepancies .",
    "the major differences in the estimated rates caused by the wt  definition had appeared in the range of short waiting times ( figures  @xmath56 ) .    in spite of the cut of wide - spreading tails , according to the authors the convergence of rates at longer waiting times can be identified , regardless of the wt  definitions that had been used .",
    "this is seen where the tails of the flare rates seem to coincide .",
    "such a convergent behaviour is independent of the solar cycle phase , as well as of the @xmath30-flares exclusion ( figure  [ fig.6 ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath30-flares exclusion leads to more ambiguous plots , since fewer events are considered in the dataset .",
    "the joint consideration of the phases demonstrates this behaviour too  ( figure  [ fig.5 ] ) .",
    "if we assume that energetically large flares are separated by longer waiting times on the average , we can conclude that the relatively long duration of energetic flares appears to be statistically indistinguishable from the long waiting times defined by the point - like events .",
    "thus , the _ ets  _ definition tends to mimic the _",
    "ptp  _ in the right - hand half of the @xmath9 domain , where the waiting times are longer .      in this work ,",
    "the pdf  are presented mostly for illustrative purposes , _",
    "i.e. _ to demonstrate a degree of divergence between the exponentials , the variation due to the solar cycle phase and the effect of the wt  definition .",
    "we do not consider the pdf  fit , but study the underlying models by means of the estimated flaring rate .",
    "the failure rate formalism described in section  [ math ] leads to a broader view on the solar flaring and physics underlying the waiting time statistics .",
    "the function @xmath14 permits a qualitative description of the dynamics of the stochastic process being characterised by the pdf @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , the rate @xmath14 and the pdf @xmath6 are related to different stochastic processes : the rate @xmath14 is the almost instantaneous probability of an event ) . ] with no event during the waiting time @xmath9 , by the definition . in turn , the pdf  @xmath6 is the probability change rate of the waiting time @xmath9 .",
    "the function @xmath14 , by definition , explicitly combines the almost instantaneous probability of the flare with the waiting time that had elapsed before its occurrence , _",
    "i.e. _ it is the conditional probability .    in other words ,",
    "the rate @xmath14 gives the probability of the event delimiting the length of @xmath9 , namely it is related to the process _ inducing _ the one being presented by the series of the waiting times in the catalogue .    in the present work ,",
    "we use the estimated rates @xmath27 to analyse the flaring dynamics which can be derived from the goes catalogue , and then we reconsider the cited stochastic models of the waiting time pdf fit .",
    "particularly , in the piece - wise constant poisson model the flare rate is a free parameter .",
    "the most important feature of the estimated @xmath27 is the variation over the @xmath9 domain .",
    "the function @xmath27 is the explicit non - linear function of @xmath9:@xmath57 with bell - like shape in semi - logarithmical plot .",
    "this has far - reaching consequences for the flaring dynamics .",
    "first , the flaring rate is by no means stationary : it non - linearly depends on waiting time of short scales of days , hours and minutes ( the fast non - stationarity for short ) .",
    "second , the flare rate has a certain behaviour : less energetic flares ( @xmath30-flares at large , but not only these ) exhibit an _ increasing _ rate .",
    "next , the rate reaches _ maximum _ values , and then it rather slowly _ declines _ ( similarly to a power - law , which in some cases manifests itself very notably ) .",
    "thus , we can point out _ characteristic waiting times _ , which indicate the time intervals of the most probable flare occurrence .",
    "we would not define this time as numerically accurate due to significant uncertainties .",
    "however , one can empirically define a range just by examining figure  [ fig.55 ] and figure  [ fig.6 ] : for joint phases , say  3545  @xmath58 .",
    "( _ ets  _ ) ; 5060  @xmath59 ( _ ptp  _ ) ; for the solar minimum , say 2055  @xmath58 .",
    "( _ ets  _ ) ; 5075  @xmath58 .",
    "( _ ptp  _ ) ; and for the solar maximum 3045@xmath60 ( _ ets  _ ) ; 60100  @xmath59 ( _ ptp  _ ) .",
    "the character of the fast non - stationarity is invariable within the solar cycle phases ( figure  [ fig.6 ] ) , and remains recognisable for smaller data records , when the @xmath30-flares are excluded ( with a word of caution on the reliability of the result based on the smaller number of samples ) .",
    "the slow non - stationarity of the flare rate is given by the solar cycles , say `` large scale '' .",
    "the phases have different probability of flaring per unit time , as it is natural to assume just on the basis of the comparative overview in figure  [ fig.1 ] .",
    "the most frequent and thus very short flares ( corresponding to the smaller @xmath9 ) are common features for both phases .",
    "they can hide statistical differences between solar cycle phases : this fact is supported by the match in the increasing regions of the rates corresponding to the disjoint phases . in figure  [ fig.6 ] , the _ ptp  _ rates are equivalent in the range from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , regardless of the solar cycle phase considered .",
    "the same statement but somewhat weaker holds for the _ ets  _ rates .",
    "qualitatively , the rate shape is invariable during the solar cycle , however , the variation in the mean wt  may reach one order of magnitude .",
    "this is the case when the @xmath30-flares are excluded ( see tables  [ table - ptp ] and [ table - ets ] ) .",
    "summarising , the flare rate takes the form @xmath63 with explicit dependence on waiting time and generic time , _",
    "i.e. _ the time frame when the corresponding observations were made .",
    "we considered separately the case of the excluded @xmath30-flares . for joint phases",
    "almost @xmath64 are @xmath30-flares and @xmath65 for the solar maxima .",
    "qualitatively , the rates retain their shape over the wt  domain .",
    "nevertheless , the rates without @xmath30-flares are systematically lower in the joint phases ( figure  [ fig.55 ] ) and with almost negligible variations during the solar maxima ( in figure  [ fig.6 ] dashed and dash - dotted lines ) .    substantial variation occurs during the cycle minima phases , when @xmath66 of the events are @xmath30-flares . in this case , the notable rate matching in the shorter increasing range is very small for the _ ptp  _ rate , and does not takes place for the _ ets  _ rates ( in figure  [ fig.6 ] solid grey lines ) .",
    "in fact , the elimination of the frequent events from the dataset is a very significant operation .",
    "particularly , the power - law exponents are sensitive to the relative strength of the frequent events .",
    "this is caused by the intrinsic divergence of the power - law statistics at the origin , at the most probable ( _ i.e. _ the most frequent ) events .    in some cases , excluding @xmath30-flares decreases the reliability of the results because of the small size of the resulting dataset .",
    "nevertheless , it underlines the average waiting time order of magnitude change , which is the reason for the separate considerations of the solar cycle phases ( see tables  [ table - ptp ] and [ table - ets ] for numerical estimates ) .      considering equation  ( [ ppdf ] ) , we compare the flare rate power - law fit with the value of @xmath52 .",
    "one should notice that the tails of @xmath14 are quite uncertain in considering the indices listed in tables  [ table - ptp ] and [ table - ets ] to be steady and exact : the change of the region boundaries being chosen for the fit can substantially modify the numerical value of the exponent , and , in a certain sense , it may be considered to be subjective .",
    "but we rely on the fact that the modulus of the estimated indices is systematically _",
    "less _ than @xmath67 .",
    "thus , arguments for fitting the goes data by equation  ( [ pw ] ) can , very likely , be rejected .    on the other hand ,",
    "jointly considered solar cycle phases in the @xmath0-ray  band with flares above @xmath30-class have revealed a value comparable with @xmath52 . by noting , that this takes place when average waiting times differ by one order of magnitude , we would point the accordance with the power - law limit pdf  of the non - stationary exponential random variable , reported by .",
    "this argument is missing in , when joint phases have been fitted confidently by the power - law .",
    "the excess of short waiting times was pointed out by and .",
    "it appears to be an intrinsic property of the flaring process , and it is detectable regardless of the instrument and(or ) the band that is used .    the rising character of the rate @xmath27 at small @xmath9 appears to be an indicator of the importance of the energetically small events",
    ". short waiting times mostly separate less energetic events .",
    "empirically , this point is supported by the influence of the _ b_-flares presence on the flare rate . in turn , the increasing probability at _ short _ wt  suggests that the true flare occurrence per short time unit is very large , but it is hidden due to sensitivity of the instruments and the obscuration .",
    "certainly , somewhere on these time scales the very sympathetic flaring @xcite would take place , and one can realise that a dependence of the form @xmath68 poses explicitly the `` memory '' in the record , _",
    "i.e. _ the probability of an event is independent of neither the waiting time elapsed before it occurs nor the preceding event . ] .",
    "thus , it is hard to ignore the arguments by concerning the memory effect in the waiting time pdf .",
    "that is also in accordance with the divergence ( _ viz .",
    "_ short flare overabundance ) of the flare duration pdf  at the origin , which is commonly accepted to be a power - law .",
    "the goes soft @xmath0-ray  flare catalogue gives an overall flaring picture , considering the sun as a whole .",
    "the beauty and power of the non - stationary poisson model is in its potential ability to represent the global solar flare dynamics as consisting of somewhat trivial ( `` memoryless '' ) mathematical objects  exponentials .",
    "presumably , the different active regions ( or even smaller regions ) may contribute to the global flaring with notably different rates and thus appear in the limit as a power - law - like distribution .",
    "however , the individual active regions have very poor statistics ( about 100 events at most ) and a series of assumptions should be made _ a priori _ ( ) .",
    "in addition , reported a piece - wise constant poisson fit for the active region , which gives a motivation to consider even smaller flaring areas to be an `` elementary piece '' in the mechanism just speculated on above .",
    "the fast variation on time scales from minutes to hours of the flare rate is a highlight among other findings in this work .",
    "the large - scale variation with the solar cycle exhibits a complexity that can be coped with by a phase - wise splitting of the data .",
    "however , the fast non - stationarity during the waiting time appears to be an intrinsic feature of the flaring dynamics , which requires a further elaboration of the present solar flaring models .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we see somewhat intermediate character of the reported results with respect to the works by , and by .",
    "the `` memory '' revealed in the data rejects models with poisson statistics . from another perspective ,",
    "a simple power - law fit very likely fails for the records relevant to a specific solar cycle phase .",
    "the piecewise - constant poisson model had inspired us to consider solar cycle phases separately .",
    "we support the argument of this model that solar cycle phases having quite inhomogeneous statistical properties that are to be considered jointly . in other words",
    ", the separate consideration of the solar cycles should be a cornerstone of a realistic modelling of the solar flaring activity .",
    "on the other hand , our findings exclude the presence of the timescale of true rate constancy ( with goes catalog precision , at least ) .",
    "even if it exists , it would be very small , and may be hard to detect .",
    "the application of renewal theory emphasises the importance of the short ( energetically small ) events in the pdf , whose dynamics had not been pointed out in the literature : partially due to removal from the dataset of the @xmath30-class flares , and partially due to systematic fitting solely the tails of the pdf  s .",
    "this brings us to problems similar to those that had arisen in the context of coronal heating by nanoflares , where , perhaps , the most significant effects are at the limit of the instrumental noise .",
