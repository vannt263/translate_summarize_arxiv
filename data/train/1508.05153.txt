    "this is the fourth paper in the series `` continuum halos in nearby galaxies - an evla survey '' ( chang - es , * ? ? ?",
    "the overall aims of the chang - es project are to investigate the occurrence , origin and nature of radio halos , to probe the disk - halo interface , and to investigate in - disk emission .",
    "we seek to understand connections between radio halos and the host disk and its environment , and to investigate the magnetic fields in these galaxies and their halos .",
    "this covers a wide variety of science , including cosmic ray transport and wind speeds , the nature and origin of galactic magnetic fields , the far - infrared radiation - radio continuum correlation , cosmic rays and high - energy modelling , disk star formation rates and presence or absence of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "note that in this context , we use the word `` halo '' to refer to gas , dust , cosmic rays and the magnetic field above and below the galaxy disk , not to be confused with stellar or dark matter halos .",
    "specifically , we call emission on larger scales , i.e. scale height @xmath1 kpc , halo emission , while the disk - halo interface is at @xmath2 kpc ( as defined in * ? ? ? * ) .    magnetic fields in the halos of edge - on galaxies , and their commonly x - shaped behaviour",
    "( magnetic field lines outside the projected galaxy s disk are bending away from the disk with increasing vertical components ) are discussed in the review by @xcite ( also see references therein ) .",
    "their intensities and degree of uniformity can be estimated from the total and polarized synchrotron emission , but many uncertainties pertaining to their structures and origins in external galaxies remain @xcite .    with chang - es ,",
    "we have observed thirty - five nearby edge - on galaxies in the radio continuum in l and c bands ( centred at approximately 1.5 and 6 ghz , respectively ) , in three array configurations ( b , c , d ; in b - configuration only l - band was observed ) of the karl g. jansky very large array ( hereafter vla ) .",
    "the recently enhanced vla allows us to trace radio continuum emission at levels fainter than previously possible via its wide bandwidth capabilities .",
    "moreover , observing on a variety of angular scales , the vla provides distinct advantages in understanding disk - halo and halo features .",
    "for example , both faint diffuse emission and distinct filamentary structures can be investigated through the combined use of compact and extended configurations .",
    "the low frequencies , chosen because of their sensitivity to synchrotron emission , in combination with observing all polarization products , enables us to derive information about the halo magnetic fields and cosmic rays .",
    "our thirty - five edge - on galaxies have inclinations higher than 75 degrees .",
    "they also adhere to limitations on declination ( more than @xmath3 degrees in order to be observed with sufficient uv coverage with the vla ) , as well as optical diameter ( 4@xmath4 15 ) and flux density ( @xmath5 23 mjy ) .",
    "three galaxies ( ngc  5775 , ngc  4565 and ngc  4244 ) just outside of these criteria were included in the sample as well , due to evidence for extra - planar gas and availability of good ancillary data .",
    "we refer to table 1 of @xcite ( paper i ) for details of the galaxy sample .",
    "the full project , with its motivation and science goals , is presented in detail in @xcite ( paper i ) .",
    "two other papers , @xcite ( paper ii ) and @xcite ( paper iii ) , present detailed results of chang - es observations of ngc  4631 and ugc  10288 , respectively .    in this , the fourth chang - es paper , we present _ all _ observations which were carried out in the shortest baseline array configuration , d , and display each galaxy of the survey with its results in the appendix . in particular , we show the stokes i maps and spectral index maps for each of the galaxies in the two frequency bands , as well as the polarization map with apparent b - vectors superposed , as derived from the stokes q and u maps . these data products are available for download at http://www.queensu.ca/changes .    additionally , new star formation rates and flux densities are presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we give a description of the sample selection , the setup of the observations and observation details .",
    "section  3 describes the data reduction with calibration procedures and section  4 presents the resulting data products , which are displayed in the appendix .",
    "analysis is presented in section  5 and the conclusions can be found in section  6 .",
    "the details of the observations are presented in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "the observations in c - band ( central frequency 6.000 ghz ) cover a bandwidth of 2 ghz ( 4.979  7.021 ghz ) , in 16 spectral windows and 1024 spectral channels ( 64 in each spectral window ) .",
    "the l - band ( central frequency 1.575 ghz ) observations cover a bandwidth of 512 mhz ( 1.247  1.503 ghz , 1.647  1.903 ghz ) , in 32 spectral windows , and 2048 spectral channels . in l - band",
    ", we placed the two base bands , of 16 spectral windows each , 144 mhz apart in order to avoid a region of particularly strong and contaminating radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "note that due to flagging during the reductions , the final central frequencies shown in tables  [ tab : imagingparametersc ] and [ tab : imagingparametersl ] for each galaxy are adjusted from the values given here .",
    "the theoretical noise level is approximately 6 @xmath0jy / beam in c - band ( with confusion limit and flagging taken into account ) . due to a high uncertainty in confusion , the theoretical estimate for l - band of 89",
    "@xmath0jy / beam is substantially higher than the actual value we achieved , which is around 30 - 35 @xmath0jy / beam .",
    "however , due to variable noise in the l - band , we measured the noise in areas far from the source where it was more uniform ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : rmsnoise ] ) . additionally , a few galaxies exhibit higher values for reasons outlined later in this paper .",
    "we have made a few modifications to the distances used in table 1 of paper i. five galaxies have had their distances modified , whereas the rest remain the same as listed in paper i.    the five galaxies with modified distances are : ngc  891 , ngc  4244 , ngc  4565 , ngc  4631 , and ngc  5907 .",
    "these were adjusted because they have distances derived from the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) @xcite .",
    "because of the reliability of the trgb method , and that it likely provides the best distances for edge - on systems , we have adopted those distances here .",
    "the most significant distance change was for ngc  4565 , which went from a hubble flow distance of 27.1 mpc to a trgb distance of 11.9 mpc .",
    "for the other four galaxies the changes were minor ( see table  [ tab : observations ] ) .    of the remaining galaxies , the distances of the five virgo cluster galaxies ( denoted with v in table  [ tab : observations ] )",
    "were adopted from @xcite .",
    "all other galaxy distances were taken from ned , using the `` hubble flow corrected for virgo and the great attractor '' ( hf ) distance , and a hubble constant of 73 km / s / mpc .",
    "since a hubble flow method may not always be accurate for nearby galaxies at low heliocentric velocities , we reviewed the galaxy distances for this paper .",
    "we compared the hf distance with the median of various tully - fisher ( tf ) derived distances .",
    "the latter are listed in ned as `` red - shift independent '' distance derivations .",
    "note that we excluded the `` tully 1988 '' values listed in ned since those are hubble flow based .",
    "for the majority of the galaxies , the changes between the two methods were well within the uncertainties associated with either method .",
    "in particular , it is not uncommon to find a factor 2 difference in the various tf - method published distances .",
    "we therefore retained the distances used in paper i for these 25 systems .",
    "the comparison showed that for 16 galaxies the agreement between the adopted hf distance and the median tf distances was better than 25% , for 9 galaxies the difference was larger than 25% .",
    "the galaxies with the largest distance uncertainty ( @xmath6 35% ) include ngc  2683 , ngc  3432 , ngc  4666 , ngc  5775 , and ngc  5792 .",
    "see table  [ tab : observations ] for our current distance list .      of the 405 hours which were awarded for the entire chang - es project , 65 hours were set apart for the d - configuration observations in two frequency bands , l and c. the observations were divided up into 13 scheduling blocks , each of which contained scans of one primary gain and phase calibrator ( hereafter referred to as the primary calibrator ) and one zero polarization calibrator to calibrate polarization leakage from the instrumentation .",
    "additionally , complex gain calibrations were performed using a source ( hereafter the secondary calibrator ) less than 10 degrees from the target galaxy .",
    "the secondary calibrator was observed before and after the galaxy scans , every 20 - 25 minutes .",
    "the bulk of the data was observed during december 2011 .",
    "two scheduling blocks were re - observed in march 2013 .",
    "see table  [ tab : observations ] for observation specifics .",
    "one scheduling block observed in c - band , i d 5062559 , suffered increased antenna system temperatures at times coinciding with bad weather ( snow ) .",
    "consequently , the rms noises for galaxies ngc  4302 , ngc  4388 , ngc  4438 , ngc  4594 , ngc  4666 and ngc  4845 increased to approximately twice the theoretical expectation at c - band .",
    "eight galaxies in the sample are too large to fit inside the primary beam of 7.5  fwhm at c - band .",
    "we thus observed these in two pointings , separated by half the diameter of the primary beam at half maximum , i.e. one quarter beam from the galaxy centre along the disk on either side of the centre .",
    "the two - pointing galaxies are marked with an asterisk beside their names in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "table  [ tab : twopointings ] lists the coordinates for the separate pointings .",
    "one single pointing was sufficient for all galaixes in l - band , where the diameter of the primary beam is 30 .",
    "all calibrations and data reductions were performed using standard routines in the _ common astronomy software applications _ package , casa , using versions 4.2 and earlier .",
    "paper iii describes in detail the process we have been following for calibrations and reductions .",
    "a summary follows here :    in order to reduce ringing across the band from strong rfi , it was necessary to hanning smooth our data .",
    "antenna - based delay calibrations have to be applied prior to this smoothing , which was done in an initial stage of the calibrations .",
    "the absolute flux density scale of the data was determined by observing one of two standard primary calibrators ; 3c286 or 3c48 ( the latter for three of our early right ascension galaxies , ngc  891 , ngc  660 and part of the ngc  2613 observations ) , and applying the perley - butler 2010 flux density scale .",
    "we used the primary calibrator to determine the bandpass corrections as well .",
    "see table  [ tab : observations ] for a list of the calibrators which were used for each galaxy in the sample .      for the polarization calibrations ,",
    "the primary calibrator was used as a polarization angle calibrator .",
    "one of the nrao standard zero polarization calibrators was used to calibrate instrumental polarization leakage .",
    "we corrected for cross - hand delays , leakage terms and polarization position angles . where in some cases the polarization leakage calibrator could not be used ( due to loss of scan during observation or being more heavily flagged than the other calibrators ) , we instead utilized the secondary calibrator where the range in parallactic angle was sufficient , i.e. more than 60 degrees .",
    "this was for example done for the galaxies in a c - band scheduling block ( i d : 4809749 ) , for which the polarization leakage calibrator scan was lost .",
    "q and u fluxes were calculated in the standard way  see paper ii and references therein .",
    "our tests have shown no difference in the result whether the secondary calibrator or polarization leakage calibrator was used .",
    "for all scans , calibrators and galaxy scans alike , we inspected the uv - data by eye . all bad data , whether from rfi or instrumental effects , were manually flagged .",
    "a number of tests were carried out using automatic casa flagging routines as well as the casa pipeline ; however , we found significantly improved results by continuing with manual flagging .",
    "generally , fewer antennas could be used for our l - band observations than for c - band , since not all vla antennas had yet been equipped with l - band receivers at the time of observation .",
    "additionally , there is typically more rfi at l - band .",
    "calibrations and flagging were carried out iteratively , until a well - calibrated data set could be obtained .",
    "the final calibrated galaxy scans were then separated from the calibrator scans , in order to be imaged in stokes i , q and u.      we have produced stokes i , q and u images , as well as spectral index maps ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ) and uncertainty maps , @xmath9 ( see sect .  [ sec : spectral_indices ] ) from the calibrated data .",
    "the _ clean _ algorithm in casa , which we use for our wide - field synthesis deconvolution , allows for multi - scale multi - frequency synthesis , _ ms - mfs _ ( see * ? ? ? * for a full description ) .",
    "we set the multi - scale feature to look for flux components at a variety of spatial scales , to account for the extended emission of our galaxies",
    ". typically our scales ranged from zero ( classic clean ) up to approximately five times the synthesized beam , but sometimes required adjustments . in l - band , and for the uv - tapered weighting in particular , fewer scales were at times necessary in order to remove artifacts for point - like sources ; for example a classic clean was set for ngc  2683 , ngc  2992 , ngc  4157 and ngc  4845 .    additionally ,",
    "the _ clean",
    "_ algorithm enabled simultaneous fitting of a spectral index across the band width ( in - band spectral index ) via a simple power law . in order for this to take place ,",
    "we set the number of taylor coefficients used to model the sky frequency dependence,_nterms _ , to 2 for all chang - es galaxies .",
    "we defer the details of spectral information to section  [ sec : spectral_indices ] , and will describe the spatial fitting , as implemented for the chang - es project , in this section .      for each galaxy ,",
    "the briggs robust weighting @xcite was used for both c and l band data .",
    "additionally , we imaged a uv - tapered version of this weighting , which we introduced in order to emphasize the broadscale structures .",
    "we achieved an increase in beam size of approximately 80% in c - band and 40% in l - band , by typically applying a 6 k@xmath10 gaussian taper in c - band and a 2.5 k@xmath10 gaussian taper in l - band to the uv - distribution .",
    "image products of both these weightings are included in data release 1 and are referred to as robust 0 and uv - tapered weightings , respectively .    in c - band",
    ", images sufficiently clear of artifacts with uv - tapered weighting could not be achieved for ngc  4438 and ngc  4845 due to particularly strong contaminating sources in the field . in l - band , the uv - tapered weighting was either challenging to achieve ( for the same reason ) or unnecessary ( the sources were imaged as point sources already at robust 0 ) for six of our galaxies ; ngc  3448 , ngc  4192 , ngc  4388 , ngc  4438 , ngc  4845 and ugc  10288 , and the attempt was discarded for these .",
    "hereafter any images shown will be of robust 0 weighting , unless otherwise specified .",
    "each imaging run was cleaned down to a flux density level of 2.5 - 3 @xmath11 . with few exceptions , we imaged the entire field ( i.e. without specifying regions ) , since a lower rms could be obtained with this strategy",
    ". additionally , the vast majority of our data do not suffer from significant artefact patterns with spurious sources outside the source region , which could jeopardize this strategy .",
    "when needed , one to two self calibrations were performed in order to deal with remaining artifacts .",
    "our self calibration strategy was based on iteratively refining the calibration table , by self calibrating at successively deeper thresholds and thus improving the input model , which in turn acts on the original visibilities . at each step ,",
    "care was taken to a ) check the model to be used for the self calibration that it did not include any artifacts and b ) check that the peak intensity of the source would not decline ( such a scenario was aided by opting for a phase - only self calibration at the first iteration , or by applying the self calibration at a shallower threshold ) .    in some cases , our cleaning strategy had to be adapted to the circumstances of the data ( the quality of a dataset , strength of emission , contamination in the field , etc ) .",
    "this particularly applies to data with high dynamic ranges ( hdr ) , due to galaxies with strong , often point - like centre sources or strong field sources ( for example ngc  660 , ngc  4594 , virgo galaxies ) .",
    "our strategies to deal with these situations include one or more consecutive runs of self calibrations , specifying regions , attempts at peeling for strong field galaxies ( see [ sec : peeling ] ) and clean parameter adjustments ( including multi - scale adjustments ) . generally , the best one can achieve in terms of hdr , is a signal over noise of the order of 10000:1 ( s. bhatnagar , priv.comm . ) .",
    "our dynamic ranges are listed in column 8 of tables  [ tab : imagingparametersc ] and [ tab : imagingparametersl ] .",
    "additionally , in cases of strong centre sources , choosing a smaller cell size will characterize the steep beam better and render a cleaner result ( e.g. ngc  4594 and ngc  4845 , both in c - band ) .",
    "stokes q and u images were produced similarly to i. these maps were used to create polarization intensity and polarization angle maps .",
    "the polarization intensity maps were corrected for bias caused by the noise level and the polarization angle maps are cut off at the 3@xmath11 level .",
    "we note that if the fraction of polarization intensity over stokes i intensity is less than 0.5% , the polarization is not believable since the calibration can not be guaranteed below that level ( s. myers , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "a uniform faraday screen resulting from the ionosphere is corrected for in the standard polarization data reduction . however , if there is differential faraday rotation , for example between the location of the primary calibrator and the source , then this is not corrected for .",
    "this effect is negligible at c - band .",
    "there could , however , be minor effects at l - band , which will be investigated in a subsequent polarization paper .",
    "our vector maps ( panels ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of the figures in the appendix ) are also apparent b - vectors which simply are e - vectors rotated by 90 degrees , because internal faraday rotation in the galaxy has not been corrected for .",
    "wideband primary beam corrections were carried out with the casa task _ widebandpbcor _ after cleaning .",
    "this task accesses information about the beam from the visibility data , and calculates a known nrao - supplied model of the primary beam ( pb ) at each frequency channel in each band .",
    "a pb cube is formed , and taylor terms are found in the same way as was done for the data set when imaging .",
    "each taylor coefficient image ( two in our case , see sect .",
    "[ sec : imaging ] and [ sec : spixmaps ] ) is then corrected .",
    "this task also corrects the spectral index image above a given threshold ( we use 5@xmath11 ) , as well as corrects a map of the formal error of the spectral index ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : spixcorrections ] ) .",
    "subsequently , we also applied primary beam corrections to the polarization intensity maps , by dividing the image with the beam created in the _ widebandpbcor _ task .",
    "note that in this paper , any displayed images are not pb corrected , but any measurements are made from the pb - corrected versions of the maps , unless otherwise indicated . for total intensity images ,",
    "use of a model for the pb rather than an observation - specific pb introduces negligible error over the scales of our galaxies .",
    "however , the effect on the spectral index maps must be investigated in more detail , which we do in sec .",
    "[ sec : spixcorrections ] .",
    "for the eight large galaxies which were observed in two pointings at c - band ( see table  [ tab : twopointings ] ) , each individual pointing was calibrated and imaged separately . although it would be preferrable to mosaic the pointings onto the same grid while still in the uv - plane",
    ", this feature is not yet implemented in casa at the time , for the _ clean _ settings that we required ( i.e. _ nterms = 2 _ ) .",
    "instead , we combined the images from the two pointings , forming a weighted ( by the primary beam ) average in the overlapping region .",
    "the images were combined in the overlapping regions out to 10% of the primary beam .",
    "this rather inclusive choice of cut - off worked well for the d configuration data , but will likely be adjusted to 50% for the b and c configuration data in the future .",
    "this strategy was applied to both the non - pb - corrected images , as well as the two primary beam pointings .",
    "the combined stokes i image was divided by the combined primary beam in order to do the pb correction .",
    "the two - pointing spectral index maps , which had already been individually pb - corrected , were similarly combined , as well as their accompanying error maps .",
    "we assessed whether the two pointings had differences within the overlap regions , such as in noise levels .",
    "in such cases additional weightings , based on the noise level , would have to be considered .",
    "this was however not the case for any of the chang - es galaxies , where separate pointings generally had been observed in turns in the same scheduling blocks , or in similar conditions .",
    "for a couple of cases , for example ngc  660 and ngc  4388 , bright field sources interfere strongly in the cleaning process , causing a less than ideal imaging result fraught with severe artifacts ( l - band only ) .",
    "an attempt was made at _ peeling _ these interfering sources in those examples , that is , to remove or decrease the intensity of the interfering source so that its impact is lessened in the final deconvolution .",
    "the process includes self calibrations with the interfering source centred , and subtracting the source from the uv - data using the casa task _ uvsub _ , in several steps . for more information on peeling ,",
    "see @xcite , as well as the phd thesis by @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : peeling ] lists the sources we peeled from ngc  660 and ngc  4438 .        as indicated in sect .",
    "[ sec : imaging ] , the ms - mfs algorithm allows for spectral fitting across the wide bands that have been used in the chang - es survey .",
    "thus , a single observation over a single wave - band permits the determination of spectral indices , @xmath7 , as a function of position within the galaxy .",
    "as described in @xcite ( see also paper ii ) , a specific intensity , @xmath12 , at some frequency , @xmath13 , within the band , can be fit with a function of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a curvature term and @xmath16 is a reference frequency ( our central frequency , @xmath16 , given in tables  [ tab : imagingparametersc ] and [ tab : imagingparametersl ] ) .",
    "as implemented , such a fitting function is expanded in a taylor series about @xmath16 , such that the first taylor term ( the map , @xmath17 ) corresponds to a map of specific intensities at @xmath16 and the second taylor term ( the map @xmath18 ) contains information on @xmath7 such that @xmath19 . the third taylor term ( @xmath20 )",
    "allows for the recovery of the spectral curvature , @xmath15 , where @xmath21 .    in principle",
    ", any number of taylor terms could enter into such an expansion with increasing numbers of terms improving the spectral fit ( see * ? ? ? * for examples ) .",
    "in practice , however , the effective number of terms is limited by the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio and calibration precision of the data . for the chang - es galaxies , tests that we have run gave poorer results with 3 terms than with 2 ; that is , the rms noise in the images is higher for such fits , when cleaning to the same threshold",
    ".    the curvature maps also show large and sometimes unrealistic variations , point - to - point .",
    "while globally averaged values of @xmath15 can still be useful ( see paper ii for an example ) , we have adopted two taylor terms for the chang - es project as indicated earlier .",
    "a two - term taylor fit then takes the simple form @xmath22 .",
    "a map of random errors describing the accuracy of the fit , @xmath23 is also formed .",
    "the beauty of the spectral fitting is that it is carried out by _ flux component _ which means that a uniform resolution is achieved over the band , with a restoring beam applied to the tt0 and tt1 maps at the end of the fitting process .",
    "also , the s / n of the entire band applies to each flux component .",
    "if one were to form a spectral index in the classical way within a band , one would need to break up the band into its various channels ( or groups of channels ) , smooth each channel to the poorest resolution of the lowest band frequency , and accept the very high noise of these channels as a cut - off when forming @xmath7 maps .",
    "clearly , the method , as implemented in casa , is far superior for any individual band . nevertheless , there are limitations , as we outline below .",
    "because the primary beam ( pb ) varies with frequency , it imposes its own spectral index , @xmath24 , onto the @xmath7 maps .",
    "this effect is significant ; for example , at the 50% level at l - band , @xmath25 .",
    "we use the casa task _ widebandpbcor _ , described in section  [ sec : pbcorrection ] , to correct for @xmath24 , and at this point , we cut off the @xmath7 maps at 5@xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the rms of the image map ( i.e. the tt0 , or @xmath26 map ) .",
    "once pb - corrected @xmath7 maps are formed , they can show large variations around their peripheries and the corresponding error maps , @xmath23 , show correspondingly large errors .",
    "in addition to the 5@xmath11 cut originally applied , we also cut off all @xmath7 maps wherever the corresponding error map exceeds a value of 1.0 .",
    "the choice of this cutoff is arbitrary ; however , various tests showed that more aggressive cuts ( e.g. where @xmath27 ) resulted in undesirable ` holes ' in some @xmath7 maps .",
    "note that this step does not change the pb correction of the @xmath7 maps .",
    "it simply discards data points that are known to have large errors .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath23 maps are computed for each map pixel ( cell ) . however ,",
    "these pixels are not independent .",
    "for example , at l - band , there may typically be 64 cells / beam and at c - band , 50 cells / beam ( both uv - tapered ) .",
    "consequently , the ` per pixel ' errors are much greater than the ` per beam ' errors and the @xmath7 maps , as produced , show variations pixel - to - pixel which are larger than beam - averaged variations would be . in addition , maps of @xmath23 show artifacts , i.e. regions of low @xmath23 that have a ` thread - like ' appearance through the map .",
    "these artifacts depend on the choice of multi - scales that are used during imaging and shift position if the map is remade with different scales .",
    "if the adopted scales are changed , these threads also shift position .    to ameliorate the above issues ,",
    "we have ` smoothed/ averaged ' our maps of @xmath7 and @xmath23 over the size of a beam .",
    "this is accomplished by artificially inserting into the map header a gaussian beam size whose area ( gaussian - weighted ) is equivalent to the pixel area and then convolving the map to the correct clean beam size .",
    "the result does _ not _ change the spatial resolution of the images but recognizes the non - independence of the pixels and strongly minimizes pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "for example , the rms of an @xmath7 map could decrease by as much as a factor of 2 after such a convolution .",
    "these are the final maps that are shown in the appendix , panels h ) , i ) , k ) and l )",
    ".    in summary , our final spectral index maps and all calculations performed on them apply to @xmath7 after    1 .",
    "pb - correction , 2 .   a 5@xmath11 cutoff , 3 .   a cutoff wherever @xmath28 , and 4 .",
    "convolving with a gaussian to smooth over pixel - to - pixel variations within any clean beam .",
    "as indicated above , @xmath7 is determined via fitting flux components over the band during the imaging process .",
    "fitting errors should , for the most part , be accounted for by the @xmath23 maps , but those maps consider random errors only . therefore , a variety of tests have been carried out on the in - band spectral index maps to help us understand realistic uncertainties , and we outline them here . largely qualitative descriptions are provided , with a quantitative summary at the end . in the following , we refer to the final @xmath7 maps , as described above , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "_ edge - effects : _    in spite of the cutoffs and smoothing outlined in the previous section , values in the spectral index maps ( as well as their errors ) tend to become extreme at the edges ( for example , see the l - band panels ( i ) and ( l ) of ngc  3735 in the appendix ) . _",
    "primary beam correction : _    the nrao - supplied pb model can not take into account variations in the pb that are specific to any given observation .",
    "the true pb will change with flexure in the antennas and therefore with position on the sky .",
    "it will also rotate on the sky as the source is tracked and therefore any non - axisymmetry in the pb will also introduce error . as a result ,",
    "pb correction errors , which increase with distance from the pointing centre , must be understood . @xcite",
    "have shown that errors in the @xmath7 maps are negligible out to the half - power point but increase significantly beyond that distance ( see their fig .  4 ,",
    "right ) . for l - band , our largest @xmath7 map ( ngc  4565 ) extends to a radius of 6.8 arcmin which is well within the hpbw of the l - band pb ( radius of 15 arcmin , or fwhm of 30 arcmin )",
    ". at c - band",
    ", however , the pb radius is only 3.75 arcmin and consequently @xmath7 maps with radii larger than this will show such errors in their outer regions .",
    "we have investigated such potential pb errors in two ways :    the first is to examine @xmath7 maps using cases in which the observations of a given galaxy were carried out in two different observing sessions , such as ngc  660 ( see table  [ tab : observations ] ) . as such , it is possible to form two different @xmath7 maps for the same galaxy and same sky pointing but observed on different days .",
    "this has allowed us to compare the resulting @xmath7 maps and to compare the variations between those days with the random errors as given in the @xmath23 maps .",
    "we tested both low and high dynamic range cases and compared the two results quantitatively .",
    "the second is to examine our c - band observations of large galaxies where two offset pointings were observed ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : twopointings ] ) . a comparison of @xmath7 made for the individual pointings allowed us to investigate @xmath7 errors at larger distances from the pb centre .    as an example ,",
    "[ fig : philipfig ] ( panel a ) shows a map of the absolute pixel - by - pixel difference between the pb - corrected spectral index measurements in the two c - band pointings of ngc 891 .",
    "an increase of the differences with distance from the map centre is clearly apparent .",
    "we formed the spectral index error ( shown in panel b ) by computing the pb - weighted deviation from the average spectral index of the two pointings , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this error map is for the most part comparable to the error calculated by the ms - mfs algorithm ( panel c ) ) , as the map of the ratio of these two errors ( panel d ) ) illustrates .",
    "a major exception to this is the disk of the galaxy , but only in those parts that are located outside the 70% pb level ( i.e. where the pb gain is less than 0.7 ) of either pointing .",
    "the average error ratio in these narrow regions around the mid - plane is @xmath315 ( with individual pixel values up to @xmath3115 ) , i.e. here the error originating from the pointing differences is on average @xmath31400% higher than the error resulting from the ms - mfs spectral fitting ( for comparison , the average error ratio of ngc  4565 is 3.3 ) .",
    "such high ratios are primarily a consequence of the small ms - mfs - based errors in regions of high signal - to - noise , yet the increase of the pointing differences with distance from the pointing centres is significant . in particular , beyond the half - power point the mid - plane errors in panel b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : philipfig ] increase up to @xmath310.5 , whereas in panel c ) they remain below 0.1 throughout the disk , as shown by the displayed contours .",
    "while the errors in panel b ) are in rough agreement with @xcite in the sense that they do not exceed 0.1 out to approximately the half - power point ( not considering the above - mentioned edge effects ) , the error ratio map suggests that the simple pb model used by the widebandpbcor task already shows significant inaccuracies at the 70% level .",
    "_ resolved out structures : _",
    "although the method of calculating the spectral index ensures that the resolution is common across the band , if there are structures that are resolved out at one end of the band compared to the other , this is not accounted for in the spectral index maps .",
    "for example , there may be structures resolved out at the high frequency end of the band , but not at the low frequency end , which would steepen the spectral index .",
    "_ comparison with classical spectral index : _",
    "a comparison was made between the in - band spectral index and a classically formed spectral index from a given band .",
    "the classically formed @xmath7 maps were made from the spectral index maps after the pb - correction was applied but not after applying further processing ( i.e. pb - correction and a 5@xmath11 cutoff were applied , but not a cutoff based on the error map , nor smoothing to the size of the beam , as described in section  [ sec : spixcorrections ] ) ; they were formed by imaging the lowest end of the band and the highest end of the band , smoothing to a common spatial resolution and then combining in the classical way .",
    "the results were in agreement within errors .",
    "_ two - pointing pb cutoffs : _ for ` two - pointing ' galaxies ( large galaxies at c - band ) the maps , as indicated in section  [ sec : twopointingimaging ] , were combined over regions in which the value of the primary beam exceeded 0.1 ( 10% of the peak ) .",
    "when mosaicking is carried out , each point is weighted by the pb such that points that are farther from the beam centre are weighted down and therefore the difference in total intensity maps , whether one cuts off points where the pb is @xmath6 10% or where the pb is @xmath6 50% , is entirely negligible .",
    "however , since @xmath7 maps are known to increase quite strongly below the 50% level , we remade our mosaicked @xmath7 maps with a 50% cutoff to compare it to the 10% cut - off values used in this paper .",
    "for these results , we found only minor differences ( for example , if the two maps are subtracted , the rms in the regions between the 50% and 10% pb cutoffs is @xmath32 0.1 ) .",
    "0.2truein in summary , our final @xmath7 maps should present realistic results with the following cautions : + a ) extreme values around the edges are artifacts and should be ignored .",

    "+ d ) the largest source of uncertainty in @xmath23 relates to the pb model correction away from the pointing centre , which most strongly affects our largest galaxies in c - band .",
    "spectral index errors increase significantly with distance from the pointing centre , such that beyond the 70% pb level of either pointing ( i.e. at distances greater than 225  from the respective pointing centre at c - band ) the @xmath23 maps typically underestimate the true errors _ in the disk _ by a factor @xmath315 ( see fig  [ fig : philipfig ] ) .",

    "all rms noise values mentioned throughout this paper have been measured from non - primary beam corrected maps . for c - band",
    ", the rms noise is measured as an average of the regions throughout the imaged field of view which do not contain detectable background sources .    for l - band , however , there are so many background sources near the galaxy that it is difficult to find sufficiently large regions within which the rms can be consistently measured .",
    "residual cleaning artifacts also tend to be larger at l - band , especially close to the galaxy where the primary beam response is high .",
    "therefore the rms tends to be variable when measured near the source , but declines to more consistent values with distance from galaxy as the primary beam response declines . for consistency ,",
    "we quote rms values far from the galaxies where there are smaller variations in rms between measurement regions .",
    "rms levels near the galaxy could be up to a factor of two higher than the quoted values of tables  [ tab : imagingparametersc ] and [ tab : imagingparametersl ] but it is apparent from the panel c ) of the appendix figures , that our choice of 3@xmath11 as the lowest contour generally well represents the faintest believable emission .",
    "panel ( g ) of the figures in the appendix provides an exploratory image intended to help the viewer discover information about individual radio halos .",
    "for example , one may like to know if point sources in the disk ( anti-)correlate with very extended halo emission .",
    "the chang - es survey is data rich , with two ( or more ) weightings provided per band and overlaying contour plots of these for both bands can result in confusing diagrams .",
    "therefore we overlay colourized `` transparent '' images of the weightings so that the viewer may relatively quickly apprehend the relationship between structures in the two observing bands . additionally , artifacts , confusion structures , and non - random noise are difficult to remove mathematically from radio data .",

    "note that this is not meant to be a thorough discussion of each galaxy .",
    "the data of polar ring galaxy ngc  660 have the highest dynamic range in both bands , due to a strong central source .",
    "consequently , the resulting images have higher than expected rms values , particularly in l - band .",
    "nevertheless , the achieved signal to noise of the c - band map with robust weighting reached 70000 , on the higher end of what best can be expected ( see section  [ sec : stokesiimaging ] ) .    in spite of careful cleaning , including peeling of the nearest of the two strongly interfering field sources in l - band ( see section  [ sec : peeling ] ) , artifacts are still present .",
    "this could potentially be affecting the spectral index results , where regions of flat spectral index are crossing the disk .",
    "however , these regions could also be an effect of the possible agn ( see [ sec : agncontamination ] ) .",
    "we note that the polarization intensity is low , with its fraction of polarization over stokes i intensity just a 10th of the 0.5% which is considered a believable signal ( see section  [ sec : polarizationimaging ] ) .",
    "both of these galaxies are well - known to have significant halos , which we can also see in our data .",
    "moreover , they both show very flat spectral indices at c - band throughout the disk , where the errors in spectral indices are the lowest .",
    "neither data set showed any particular problems and were single pointings .",
    "bearing in mind the summary regarding spectral index in section  [ sec : alpha_errors ] , this suggests that thermal emission may be more strongly dominant for these galaxies in their disks .    for ngc  5775 at l - band , some broadscale polarization features have been found in the field that are most likely from foreground galactic emission ( this is more obvious when a larger field than shown in the appendix is displayed ) .",

    "our polarization images are likely picking up this same extended foreground structure at lower frequency .",
    "these galaxies are highly affected by contamination from strong sources in the field , such as m87 , rendering higher than normal rms noise and artifacts hard to clean out .",
    "this may have an effect on both spectral index results and polarization .",
    "we note that the c - band spectral index is steep in the inner disk for ngc  4192 ( a rather weak source at the low end of our flux density cutoff for the survey ) , and that the uncertainties are high .",
    "ngc  4388 was particularly affected by m87 , and we made an attempt at peeling the source in l - band , as well as self calibrating on m84 ( the other disturbing source in the field ) , which rendered some improvement .",
    "the resulting rms at l - band was too high for us to detect significant polarized flux ( panel f ) .",

    ", the rms could not be brought down to lower than almost three times the expected value .",
    "l - band observations of ngc  4438 differ from the other galaxies , in that only the upper half of the frequency range ( spectral windows 16 - 31 ) was used for imaging , with a central frequency of 1.77 ghz .",

    "no other technical issues ( antenna flexure , solar influence ) are problematic .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that this galaxy displays an interesting variation in flux density level and further exploration , being published in chang - es v ( irwin et al . , 2015 , accepted by apj ) , indicates with little doubt that the source is indeed variable .",
    "chang - es v also explores the spectral index and polarization results in more detail .      due to the low declination of this galaxy ,",
    "the c - band observations were divided up into three scheduling blocks in order to a ) avoid shadowing and b ) increase uv - coverage .",
    "the scheduling block in which the first pointing was observed did not have a polarization leakage calibrator scan , and instead the secondary calibrator used for ngc  4192 was used to calibrate polarization leakage ( the secondary calibrator of ngc  5084 did not have a sufficiently large parallactic angle span ) .",
    "part of the second pointing was strongly affected by shadowing and only 21 antennas were used for these scans .",
    "the c - band images show emission extending east and west of the point - like centre , as well as southward from the eastern extension ",

    "however the extensions seen above and below the centre may be spurious since they seem to align with weak residual side lobes . in l - band",
    ", we find no apparent polarization from the source .",
    "the spectral index is flat in l - band and flat to slightly positive in c - band ( but the positive trend coincides with higher error values ) .",

    "the error ( columns 3 and 6 ) , which is the difference between the two weightings , also encompasses inclusion vs non - inclusion of such point sources . in most cases , however , the calibration error ( flux density scale accuracy ) which is estimated to be about 2% is larger than this error .",

    ", we crudely correct our sfrs by assuming that 100% of the nuclear 22  emission arises from the agn .",
    "a literature search suggests that all ten candidates are starburst nuclei except for two , ngc  3735 and ngc  4388 , with perhaps the most compelling evidence coming from the ir line ratio study of nuclei by @xcite .",
    "we explored this issue further by making a rough determination of the nuclear 3.4 - 4.6  colour from the wise werga images , a measure which distinguishes well between agn and starbursts ( * ? ? ?",
    "26 , and references therein ) .",
    "we estimated the colour of the central source in two different ways , both of which include simplifying approximations .",
    "the resolutions are 5.9  and 6.5  at 3.4 and 4.6 respectively .",
    "first , we fit a 2-d gaussian with a constant background to the central peak in each band .",
    "we tried this with two different box sizes : 9  x 9  and 12  x12 .",
    "we then turned the flux density ratio of the gaussians into a colour .",
    "the second method was to gaussian - convolve the 3.4  images to the 4.6  resolution , make a colour map , and examine the colour in a central box of size 6  x 6 .",
    "the reason these methods are approximate is first that the psfs have significant airy disks , so some of the flux density is not in the central peak and not described by a gaussian , and second that a constant background is not necessarily the best assumption in the first method since the galaxy has structure as it cuts through the fitting box .",
    "however , the results are reasonably consistent from the two methods .    although fig .",
    "26 of @xcite represents a range of redshifts , our resulting colours clearly fall into either the spiral / starburst or agn regions , and the classifications are generally consistent with the evidence from the literature , with two exceptions .",
    "the first exception is ngc  3735 , which has a starburst - like nuclear colour of about 0.0 - 0.3 mag ( the range is from the two different methods and shows the greatest discrepancy for any of the ten galaxies ) , whereas mir line ratios from @xcite clearly indicate an agn . in this case , we tend to favour the mir over the nir evidence because of the possibility of extinction hiding the nir emission from the agn in an edge - on geometry . if it is an agn , we can only estimate the sfr by measuring the disk flux density outside a radius of 13 .",
    "this reduces the sfr to 1.1@xmath38/yr , although strictly this is a lower limit .",
    "the second exception is ngc  660 , where a colour of 1.2 - 1.3 clearly indicates an agn .",
    "if indeed an agn , the nuclear flux density can be crudely subtracted via a gaussian fit to the central peak in the 22  image , leaving a lower limit sfr of 0.61 - 0.81 @xmath38/yr , depending on the fit parameters . yet the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicates a starburst , as well as a liner galaxy .",
    "thus , we will continue assuming ngc  660 to be a starburst rather than agn galaxy , and retain the originally derived values in table  [ tab : sfr_etc ] .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  4388 does appear to be agn - dominated ( see also e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a colour of 1.1 mag .",
    "the 22-  flux density is dominated by this source , and the faint disk emission is not well resolved from it .",
    "hence , to estimate the sfr , we turn to the spitzer 24-  image , where the disk is better resolved .",
    "however , in this case the nuclear source so overwhelms the disk that the uncertainty in the flux density of a gaussian fit precludes an estimate of a disk sfr as was done for ngc  660 . at best",
    ", we can crudely estimate a disk flux density outside a radius of 7  from the nucleus .",
    "hence , the sfr of 0.07 @xmath38/yr is a lower limit .",
    "it has long been suspected that the extent of radio halos is related to sfr or sfr per unit area ( sfr surface density ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a preliminary ` quick - look ' to see whether such ordering applies to the chang - es sample , we have formed two maps displayed in figures  [ fig : megamap1b ] and  [ fig : megamap3 ] .",
    "these maps have been formed from the l - band primary - beam - corrected images .",
    "they have then been ordered by sfr surface density as described in the previous section , the latter quantity importantly being independent of distance .",
    "it is important to keep in mind in this section , that in spite of the well - defined criteria used in the previous section , some starburst - classified galaxies may still have , in addition , hidden agn contamination , and future examination of the chang - es sample including higher resolution data sets should help to clarify this issue .    the first map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : megamap1b ] ) is an attempt to bring all galaxies to a common distance of 10 mpc so that their 1.6 ghz sizes can be compared .",
    "each image was first rotated according to the ks position angle provided in ned and then minor adjustments were made of order @xmath39 to produce better horizontal alignment .",
    "the galaxies were then scaled in size by the ratio , ( d/(10 mpc))@xmath37 .",
    "appropriate adjustments were made to ensure that the brightness ( i.e. specific intensity ) did not change during this process .",
    "the displayed beams ( lower right hand corner of each panel ) were scaled in the same way and , since the resolutions were all similar ( though not identical ) for the l - band data , a glance at these beams reveals the distances and linear spatial resolutions of the galaxies ; the more distant galaxies have large beams after scaling , whereas the closer galaxies have small beams .    fig .",
    "[ fig : megamap1b ] reveals a wide range of physical sizes for the radio continuum emission in the various galaxies , both along the disk and into the halo .",
    "some of the galaxies show a strong dominant central radio core ( e.g. ngc  4594 ) , others show a fairly large vertical radio extent ( e.g. ngc  4666 ) ; some appear rather long and thin ( e.g. ngc  4565 ) , others show peculiar structure ( e.g. ngc  4438 which has a radio lobe ) and yet others are clearly influenced by nearby companions ( e.g. ngc  4302 ) .",
    "the physical resolution , of course , varies for each galaxy and a detailed analysis must await a future paper . nevertheless , it is fairly obvious that the first map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : megamap1b ] ) is more of a comparison of radio continuum sizes than a revelation about correlations with sfr per unit area .",
    "we also note that there is sometimes an uncomfortable range of distances in the literature for some of the galaxies",
    ".    the second map ( fig .  [ fig : megamap3 ] ) is again ordered by sfr surface density .",
    "however , rather than scaling by distance , the galaxies are scaled by the 22  wise werga major axis sizes ( table  [ tab : sfr_etc ] ) . the galaxy which has the largest angular size on the sky is ngc  4244 and the smallest is ngc  5084 ( 11.5  and 0.73  respectively ) .",
    "all galaxies were therefore scaled up to match the angular size of ngc  4244 , again ensuring that the brightness was not changed and that the beams were also scaled .",
    "such a map now essentially corrects for the various physical sizes of the galaxies ( at 22 ) .    in this map",
    ", the radio emission still shows some size variation because the radio emission embedded within the galaxy might be compact or extended and , again , the spatial resolution varies . nevertheless , a trend is now apparent , with galaxies at the top left ( high sfr surface density ) appearing more ` boxy ' , on average , than galaxies at the bottom right ( low sfr surface density ) .",
    "for example , ngc  4244 , which has the lowest sfr / unit area is clearly a very ` flat ' galaxy with no radio halo evident , consistent with the hi distribution observed with a deep observation by @xcite . on the other hand , ngc  4666 which is unlikely to be contaminated by an agn and",
    "has good spatial resolution , has an obvious halo .",
    "explorations of correlations with other parameters awaits a future paper .",
    "the fact that we now have all maps scaled to the same 22  diameter in fig .",
    "[ fig : megamap3 ] allows us to form the median edge - on galaxy at l - band .",
    "that is , we can explore what the typical edge - on spiral galaxy looks like in the radio continuum .",
    "we have done this for 30 of our 35 galaxies , excluding ngc  660 ( too distorted since it is a merger ) , ngc  4438 ( presence of plume / bubble ) , ngc  4594 and ngc  5084 ( large beam ) , and ugc  10288 ( emission dominated by a background agn ) .",
    "we formed the median of the 30 galaxies after having converted the brightness to units of jy / pixel . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mediangalaxy ] and takes advantage of the collective sensitivity of all 30 galaxies . in the image , we also plot a sample 22  contour ( red ) that corresponds to the scaling of the radio data .",
    "[ fig : mediangalaxy ] shows the spectacular radio extent of the typical spiral galaxy ( note that the average beam is much smaller than the displayed radio extent ) , predicted half a century ago by @xcite ( see their fig .  1 , p. 18 ) .",
    "the galaxy has the appearance of a slightly flattened ellipsoid and reveals that cosmic rays and magnetic fields not only permeate the galaxy disk itself , but extend far above and below the disk , as has been discussed by e.g. @xcite .",
    "we note that the red ellipse is not affected by the larger beams of the radio images and should not be used , at this point , to make conclusions about the radial distribution of the emission compared to the 22  emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the conclusion of a broadscale halo is robust ; we have checked the contribution of the disk emission to the apparent vertical radio extent by examining the lower inclination galaxies in the sample , finding that the disk made a negligible contribution .",
    "if galaxies that have lower inclination are removed , the halo remains , suggesting that the vertical distribution is not a result of a projected disk .",
    "in addition , the halo extends beyond what would be expected from beam smoothing .",
    "the galaxy scale heights ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for method ) and magnetic field extents will be discussed further in future papers .",
    "1 .   in this chang - es iv paper",

    "no changes in spatial resolution results from this process .",
    "3 .   spectral index uncertainties have been thoroughly investigated .",
    "apart from extreme values near the edges `` edge - effect '' which should be ignored , there are effects of the primary beam corrections .",
    "our tests on two pointing data show that results outside the half - power level of the primary beam model used in casa need be treated with caution . the true error in @xmath7",
    "is typically underestimated by 20% in the formal error maps . in regions of high signal - to - noise",
    ", they may even underestimate the error by a factor @xmath315 .",
    "the latter affects c - band more than l - band , since the galaxies do not extend beyond the half - power point of the primary beam for l - band .",
    "galaxies with flatter @xmath7 values at the centres often have indications of central activity . in some cases , such as ngc  2820 ,",
    "ngc  3556 and ngc  5775 and others , @xmath7 is flatter at c - band than in l - band , suggesting a higher contribution from thermal emission at the higher frequency .",
    "star formation rates were derived via wise - werga images , and potential agn contamination of the sfr results investigated .",
    "many candidates may have starburst nuclei , with the exceptions of ngc  660 , ngc  3735 and ngc  4388 who may indeed harbour an agn .",
    "lower limit sfr are calculated for these and used for the two latter galaxies .",
    "we scaled , rotated and ordered the l - band images of the chang - es galaxies by sfr surface density in order to be able to compare the galaxies on equal footing and get a snap shot of potential correlations between sfr and halo size .",
    "we produced two maps , one scaled by distance ( to 10 mpc ) , the other by the 22  wise - werga sizes , and the second one does reveal a trend of galaxies harbouring larger halos having higher sfr densities .",
    "the l - band images from the previous point were medianed to bring forth the median edge - on galaxy , which harbours a compelling halo .",
