    "the variational approach was among the first theoretical methods developed to study nonperturbative ground - state properties of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "soon after the inception of qcd , it was brought to bear on the physics of the gluon vacuum as well @xcite , making increasingly use of its capabilities to treat nonperturbative problems analytically , at real time and at strong coupling ( in contrast e.g. to semiclassical approximations ) .",
    "indeed , variational techniques remain applicable even in non - static and curved spacetimes @xcite as well as in nonequilibrium situations @xcite .",
    "since variational problems are naturally formulated in the schrdinger picture , furthermore , they often invoke quantum - mechanical intuition to shed new light on field - theoretic states , as encoded e.g. in the node number of their wave functionals @xcite  or in the action of transformation groups @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , field - theoretic applications have to implement the uv field modes and their dynamics exactly @xcite , they must deal with the standard renormalization issues in the schrdinger representation @xcite , and they require a manageable way of calculating matrix elements by functionally integrating over physical intermediate states . for gauge theories , maintaining gauge invariance becomes an additional mandatory requirement which , in the hamiltonian formulation , amounts to preserving gauss law .",
    "traditionally , the latter is implemented in combination with ( almost ) complete gauge fixing to coulomb gauge @xcite , although generally without full account of the gauge - group topology and the resulting gribov copies .",
    "in addition , this gauge - fixed approach has to deal with a nonlocal hamiltonian @xcite and must take special precautions to avoid gauge - symmetry breaking approximations @xcite .    alternatively , the variational problem can be formulated in a ( residual ) gauge - invariant manner which , at least under certain approximations , remains analytically tractable @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of dimensional transmutation becomes manifestly gauge - invariant and particularly transparent from this perspective @xcite , and the dynamical mass gap @xcite emerges already from a minimal parametrization of the gaussian core  wave functional @xcite .",
    "the projection onto the gauge - singlet component of this core functional may furthermore generate an area law for spacelike wilson loops and thereby account for linear quark confinement @xcite , although experience from compact electrodynamics suggests that the vacuum wave functional will need non - minimal adjustments to describe the charged sector @xcite .",
    "another attractive feature of this approach is that it reexpresses the infrared dynamics in terms of gauge - invariant matrix fields ( which subsume whole families of gauge - field orbits @xcite ) and that it preserves traceable links of heuristic value between these soft collective  fields and the underlying yang - mills fields .",
    "moreover , the gauge - invariant reformulation preserves the global , i.e. topological properties of the gauge fields .",
    "the contributions from all vacuum homotopy classes as well as instanton - mediated transitions between them , for example , are explicitly and transparently taken into account without recourse to the semiclassical approximation @xcite .",
    "besides such sets of ( multi- ) instanton and meron orbits , the dynamics contained in the vacuum wave functional sustains a rich variety of additional gauge - invariant infrared modes , including faddeev - niemi knots and other topological as well as nontopological solitons @xcite",
    ".    our main objective in the present article will be to improve the vacuum description provided by the gauge - invariant variational approach . to this end",
    ", we develop a trial functional family which accommodates a rather general momentum distribution for the infrared vacuum modes while remaining analytically tractable . due to the explicit representation of the ground state , structural aspects of the yang - mills dynamics and their impact on the vacuum",
    "can then be understood in terms of the resulting gauge - field population . moreover",
    ", our generalized trial basis will aid in the full exploration of the gauge - projected gaussian functional space , e.g. by evaluating and analyzing relevant amplitudes , and thereby in the assessment of its limitations and further improvement potential . in the longer run",
    ", this type of analysis should reveal the extent to which yang - mills vacuum physics can be captured by the most general gaussian core  functionals , their subsequent gauge projection and the mean - field treatment of the resulting soft - mode dynamics .",
    "one may hope that these insights will eventually help to find a systematic and manageable approximation to the yang - mills vacuum wave functional beyond the gaussian ansatz .    after having set up our extended trial functional space ,",
    "the next major task will be to establish the framework for calculating the associated vacuum amplitudes .",
    "this will enable us , in particular , to evaluate the vacuum energy density and its reduction in the generalized trial space , thus providing a quantitative measure for the improvement of the vacuum description .",
    "the analysis of the infrared mode distribution encoded in the energetically favored wave functional will further shed new light on the resulting vacuum physics .",
    "it will , in particular , reveal the physical significance of the variational parameters and clarify the impact of their optimized values on the soft - mode dynamics .",
    "we will furthermore examine the influence of the enlarged trial space on the phase structure and the order - disorder phase transition of the underlying infrared dynamics ( which has , as the yang - mills dynamics , its origin in the imposition of gauge invariance ) .",
    "in fact , the robustness of this phase transition ensures a reliable variational determination of the ground - state energy .",
    "our analysis of the resulting vacuum properties will be complemented by evaluating the lowest - dimensional gluon condensate , which also provides a quantitative test of the dynamically generated mass scale and its relation to the underlying trace anomaly . beyond  the evaluation and analysis of specific amplitudes ,",
    "finally , the extended variational framework will furnish a transparent theoretical laboratory well - suited to build up nonperturbative real - time intuition about the yang - mills vacuum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ vwf ] we introduce our infrared - generalized , gauge - invariant trial functional family for the yang - mills ground state . in sec .",

    "[ gap ] where we set up the saddle - point expansion for the integral over the soft modes .",
    "we further derive the corresponding gap equation and find its solutions , which provide quantitative information on the phase structure of the soft - mode dynamics . in sec .",
    "[ vend ] we calculate the various contributions to the vacuum energy density ( both in the ordered and disordered phase ) which we minimize in sec . [ vmin ] .",
    "we further compute the gluon condensate , discuss the physical implications of our results and suggest a few directions for future work . in sec .",
    "[ suc ] , finally , we collect our principal results and our main conclusions .",
    "the success of variational estimates depends mostly on the choice of the underlying trial function(al ) space . ideally , it should be both comprehensive enough to accommodate the relevant physics and concise enough to remain analytically tractable and reasonably transparent . in the following sections we establish the basis of our subsequent  analysis by introducing a gauge - invariant trial - functional family for the yang - mills ground state which is designed to compromise between these conflicting goals .",
    "although our trial space expands the minimal one used in ref .",
    "@xcite substantially , the ensuing variational analysis will turn out to require only a moderate increase in computational effort .",
    "our basis implements feynman s three requirements for trial wave functionals of gauge theories , i.e. the at least approximate  calculability of matrix elements , the correct uv asymptotics and gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "the major methodological advance of ref .",
    "@xcite was to show that a trial space of manifestly gauge - invariant wave functionals , namely gauge - projected gaussians , still permits an ( approximately ) analytically manageable variational analysis . in the following sections we first discuss the essential features of the minimal ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite , and then generalize its momentum distribution for the infrared vacuum modes .",
    "variational analyses are naturally set up in the hamiltonian formulation of yang - mills theory and in the coordinate  schrdinger picture .",
    "this restricts gauge transformations to a fixed reference time , thereby effectively decoupling them from the dynamical time evolution . in the temporal ( or weyl ) gauge @xmath0 which we adopt in the following ,",
    "the residual gauge transformations are static , furthermore , and problems with negative - norm states ( as e.g. in covariant gauges ) are avoided from the outset .",
    "the gauge invariance  of the vacuum wave functional is imposed by gauss law which acts as a subsidiary condition in fock space .",
    "this is particularly crucial for variational treatments because the yang - mills hamiltonian becomes unique only when acting on physical states .",
    "hence , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , trying to minimize the vacuum expectation value of the hamiltonian in the whole space of normalizable functionals could favor contributions from unphysical parts of the hilbert space which may be almost arbitrarily enhanced by adding functionals of gauge - group generators to a given hamiltonian .    starting from an approximate and hence typically gauge - dependent  core  functional @xmath1 to be specified in sec .",
    "[ gcf ] ( @xmath1 depends on the static gauge fields @xmath2 , i.e. on half of the canonical variables ) , we impose gauge invariance by projecting on its gauge - singlet component , which amounts to averaging over the gauge group @xcite .",
    "the result is a trial vacuum wave functional of the form@xmath3   = \\sum_{q\\in z}e^{iq\\theta}\\int d\\mu\\left [ u^{\\left (   q\\right )   } \\right ]   \\psi_{0}\\left [   \\vec{a}^{u^{\\left (   q\\right ) } } \\right ]   = : \\int du\\psi_{0}\\left [   \\vec{a}^{u}\\right ]   \\label{ginvvwf}%\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the invariant haar measure of the su@xmath5 gauge group , since center elements of su@xmath5 act trivially on the gauge fields .",
    "following ref .",

    "@xmath6 is the homotopy degree or winding number of the group element @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the vacuum angle .",
    "the expression ( [ ginvvwf ] ) acquires the obligatory @xmath8 phase under large ( i.e. topologically nontrivial ) gauge transformations and renders gauss law manifest .    instead of dealing with the gauge - invariant trial functional ( [ ginvvwf ] )",
    ", one may alternatively evaluate the energy density of gauge-_dependent _ gaussian wave functionals and then correct for the lack of gauge invariance before minimiziation .",
    "this approach was pursued in ref .",
    "@xcite where the spurious kinetic energy due to gauge rotations was subtracted by thouless - valatin projection ( as originally developed for the treatment of deformed nuclei ) .",
    "the main advantages of the approach based on wave functionals of the type ( [ ginvvwf ] ) are that gauge invariance of subsequent calculations and approximations is maintained exactly , and that it applies universally to _ all _ matrix elements .      in order to determine the gauge - invariant trial functionals ( [ ginvvwf ] ) and the related amplitudes completely",
    ", it remains to adopt a core functional family @xmath1 . as in any variational calculation",
    ", this choice generally remains an uncontrolled approximation without systematic improvement strategy . in order to motivate our choice for @xmath1 and to discuss the underlying physics , we first recall that the vacuum wave functional can not have nodes , i.e. that @xmath9   \\geq0 $ ] for all @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "( this provides an example for how quantum - mechanical insights remain applicable to field theory in the schrdinger representation as long as its infinitely many degrees of freedom do not generate qualitatively new effects . )",

    "we represent it as a functional power series in @xmath10 and determine physically reasonable and analytically tractable truncations .",
    "the first two terms of this series are generally discarded : constant terms can be absorbed into the normalization constant @xmath12 , while the term linear in the gauge field ( by itself ) corresponds to a coherent vacuum state which is known to be unstable @xcite .",
    "the next term is quadratic in @xmath10 and plays several crucial roles .",
    "the first originates from an ambiguity in @xmath13 which is due to the invariance of the haar measure in eq .",
    "( [ ginvvwf ] ) under right ( or left ) multiplication by any given group element . as a consequence ,",
    "infinitely many choices for @xmath14   $ ] lead up to an unphysical redefinition of the normalization constant to the same @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this ambiguity can be removed , however , by prescribing the quadratic term of @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , this term leads to a product of gaussian vacuum wave functionals of the abelian u@xmath16 gauge theory which asymptotic freedom renders exact in the ultraviolet .",
    "finally , and from the practical perspective most importantly , the gaussian functional @xmath1 resulting from a quadratic term can be integrated over @xmath10 analytically , while higher - order contributions may at best be treated perturbatively @xcite .",

    "we are now going to specify the properties of the covariance ( [ cov ] ) which characterizes the members of our core trial functional family ( [ ga ] ) and which contains the variational parameters whose values will be adapted below to optimally approximate the yang - mills vacuum wave functional .",

    "[ cl ] , is indispensable both for our approximations to remain valid and for the quantitatively reasonable size prediction of the gluon condensate ( [ gc ] ) and other vacuum scales to emerge .",
    "another issue meriting discussion is the order of the transition between the strongly- and weakly - coupled vacuum phases . above we found the ( dis)order parameter @xmath430 to vanish continuously at the phase boundary , which indicates a second - order transition .",

    "we conclude our analysis by briefly reviewing several additional features of the resulting vacuum description . to begin with the uv physics",
    ", we note that the one - loop yang - mills @xmath30 function can be recovered almost completely from the dynamics implemented in the uv covariance ( [ gm1uv ] ) ( up to a missing @xmath551 correction due to color screening @xcite ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the screening contribution may be accounted for as well , e.g. by generalizing the tensor structure of the uv covariance @xcite .",
    "( we note in passing that rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory , even to higher orders of the gauge coupling , could be set up directly in our wave - functional basis ( [ ginvvwf ] ) since it renders gauss law manifest . )",
    "turning to the ir physics content , we start by emphasizing that dimensional transmutation emerges naturally from gauge - invariant wave functionals ( [ ginvvwf ] ) with gaussian cores ( [ ga ] ) , and that it generates the infrared mass scale and the crucial mass gap dynamically .",
    "since a gaussian becomes the exact ground state of both massless and _ massive _ vector fields in the non - interacting limit , furthermore , one may expect it to yield an adequate description whenever the main net effect of the interactions is to create a quasi - particle - like selfenergy .",
    "similarly , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the gaussian approximation should provide a reasonable description of yang - mills vacuum physics as long as the latter is dominated by a single gluon condensate ( which qcd sum - rule analyses suggest especially in the glueball sector @xcite ) .",
    "an important advantage of the gauge - projected wave functionals ( [ ginvvwf ] ) is that they incorporate the nontrivial topology of the gauge group and thereby of the gauge fields .",
    "in particular , they contain instanton effects  @xcite which play an especially important role in the spin-0 glueball sector @xcite and emerge even in basic holographic duals for yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the functional ( [ ginvvwf ] ) comprises large classes of additional , gauge - invariant ir degrees of freedom which are often of topological origin as well @xcite .",
    "those are typically collective excitations gathered by gauge orbits of vacuum fields which were found to dominate the saddle - point expansion of the generating soft - mode functional ( [ gf ] ) and to provide gauge - invariant physical interpretations e.g. for merons and faddeev - niemi knots @xcite .",
    "another crucial consequence of the infrared fields populating the yang - mills vacuum , confinement , is characterized by the emergence of a linear potential between sufficiently far separated , static quark sources . despite the rather direct access to the interquark potential provided in the schrdinger representation @xcite and heuristic arguments given in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , it remains to be shown that gauge - averaged wave functionals ( [ ginvvwf ] ) with a gaussian core of the type ( [ ga ] ) are capable of generating the confinement - induced area law for large , spacelike wilson loops .",
    "several cautionary lessons from 3-dimensional , compact electrodynamics can be found in ref .",
    "( the behavior of the adjoint wilson loop would be of interest as well . )",
    "explorations of confinement in coulomb gauge encouragingly found a gaussian wave functional , divided by the square root of the faddeev - popov  determinant , to generate a linear heavy - quark potential @xcite .    in this context , one should further emphasize that confinement ( as well as other crucial vacuum features ) is expected to emerge in our framework only after gauge projection .",
    "in fact , feynman had argued almost three decades ago @xcite that for a mass gap to be generated in a non - abelian gauge theory , all field configurations with non - vanishing support at large  @xmath10 should either be gauge - equivalent to others with support only at small  @xmath10 or damped by their magnetic field energy .",
    "this argument is suggestive because then , in analogy with finite - dimensional quantum mechanics , the wave functionals of the ground and first - excited states can not arbitrarily reduce their energy difference by favoring long - wavelength potentials  @xmath10 extending over all of space . as a consequence",
    ", the energy or ( in the static case ) mass gap can not be closed .",
    "it would be important to check whether a gauge - projected gaussian wave functional can realize this mechanism .    in order to simplify the analysis and to focus on the still rather poorly understood infrared gluon sector of qcd",

    "this amounts to a substantial improvement upon previously used trial states which populated all infrared modes with identical , i.e. momentum - independent strength .",
    "our extension of the trial basis rests on a controlled expansion of the infrared - mode dispersion relation ( or covariance ) , which characterizes the vacuum wave functional , into powers of the soft momenta divided by the dynamically generated mass scale .",
    "the momentum dependence can then be systematically approximated by truncating the series , which allows us to restrict the quantitative part of our study to the leading - order corrections . after complementing the generalized soft vacuum - mode population by the leading perturbative ultraviolet modes ,",
    "finally , one ends up with the largest gauge - invariant trial space for the yang - mills vacuum wave functional ( in 3 + 1 dimensions ) which is currently available and which keeps the variational analysis analytically manageable .",
    "the multifaceted vacuum physics emerging from energy minimization in this extended trial space turns out to be partly shaped by a subtle interplay between different parts of the dynamics . to begin with ,",
    "the leading - order momentum distribution of the infrared modes is characterized by just one variational parameter . after translating the dynamical content of the wave functional into an effective lagrangian for collective  sets of soft gauge - field orbits , this",
    "parameter reappears as the coupling constant of the dominant higher - gradient interactions which modify the low - momentum dispersion of the vacuum modes .",
    "moreover , it acquires an intuitive physical interpretation in terms of the group velocity of gauge - field quasiparticles in the vacuum . while this velocity vanishes in the unimproved ground state ,",
    "one of our main findings is that it becomes finite in the improved one .",
    "the novel dispersion relation further reveals that the infrared quasigluons in the vacuum decelerate when a force is applied to them . in other words ,",
    "their effective kinetic mass  is negative ( analogous situations are encountered in several condensed matter systems ) and their color conductivity can increase with increasing strength of an external color - electric field , implying a negative differential resistance of the vacuum .",
    "the variationally optimized value of the higher - gradient coupling turns out to be positive .",
    "this sign may at first appear surprising since it is opposite to the one induced by the massive vector propagator which was previously adopted as a model for the infrared covariance .",
    "its physical impact is quite intuitive , however , since it implies that soft gauge - field modes with larger momenta populate the vacuum more strongly than their longest - wavelength counterparts .",
    "vacuum fields with constant color - magnetic field strength are thus energetically disfavored , in particular , which prevents the onset of the savvidy instability .",
    "an energy barrier against larger quasigluon velocities preserves the normalizability of the vacuum wave functional and keeps the variationally determined value of the quasigluon velocity small .",
    "in addition , it implies the existence of a saddle - point solution for the disorder - parameter field at a dynamically generated mass scale which is consistent with lattice results for the yang - mills scale .",
    "( as a practical side benefit , the relatively small optimized coupling - parameter value also justifies a leading - order perturbative treatment of the four - soft - mode interactions . )",
    "moreover , the above findings indicate that the dimensional transmutation mechanism is an almost quantitatively robust feature of gauge - projected gaussian core functionals ( instead of emerging accidentally from an oversimplified trial space ) . as a consequence of this rather nontrivial result the lowest - dimensional gluon condensate , which scales with the fourth power of",
    "the dynamically generated infrared mass scale , acquires a magnitude well inside the range predicted by other sources .",
    "this observation further supports the conjecture that gaussian trial functionals provide a reasonable vacuum description in dynamical situations where just one vacuum condensate dominates .",
    "while this holds e.g. for the cooper - pair condensate in the bcs theory of superconductivity , it is less well established in yang - mills theory where the lowest - dimensional gluon condensate provides the natural candidate .",
    "the main reasons for the robustness of the vacuum scales turn out to be that the nontrivial solution of the gap equation is unique and that the disordered vacuum phase exists only in a limited domain of all variational parameters .",
    "even the soft - mode dynamics order - disorder phase transition , where the vacuum energy attains its minimum , remains squarely of second order .",
    "this is in contrast to the first order predicted by lattice simulations and probably a shortcoming of the employed mean - field approximation near the transition . in any case",
    ", the improved dispersion generates a considerably larger attraction among the variationally optimized vacuum fields and lowers the vacuum energy density by more than @xmath552 .",
    "this indicates that the nonvanishing quasigluon velocity provides a rather substantial overall improvement of the vacuum description .",
    "nevertheless , the gauge - invariant variational framework remains analytically tractable , the computational costs are comparable to those of fully gauge - fixed approaches , and the rather high degree of transparency owed to the explicit representation of the vacuum state is maintained . in combination , these qualities suggest considerable further potential of our approach as an intuitive theoretical laboratory for gaining insights into the nonperturbative real - time physics of yang - mills theories .",
    "the established framework provides , in particular , a privileged testing ground for the impact of topological vacuum excitations and their relation to the gauge symmetry .",

    "<S> we study a gauge - invariant variational framework for the yang - mills vacuum wave functional . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is built on gauge - averaged gaussian trial functionals which substantially extend previously used trial bases in the infrared by implementing a general low - momentum expansion for the vacuum field dispersion ( which is taken to be analytic at zero momentum ) . when completed by the perturbative yang - mills dispersion at high momenta , </S>",
    "<S> this results in a significantly enlarged trial functional space which incorporates both dynamical mass generation and asymptotic freedom . </S>",
    "<S> after casting the dynamics associated with these wave functionals into an effective action for collections of soft vacuum - field orbits , the leading infrared improvements manifest themselves as four - gradient interactions . </S>",
    "<S> those turn out to significantly lower the minimal vacuum energy density , thus indicating a clear overall improvement of the vacuum description . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensional transmutation mechanism and the dynamically generated mass scale remain almost quantitatively robust , however , which ensures that our prediction for the gluon condensate is consistent with standard values . </S>",
    "<S> further results include a finite group velocity for the soft gluonic modes due to the higher - gradient corrections and indications for a negative differential color resistance of the yang - mills vacuum . </S>"
