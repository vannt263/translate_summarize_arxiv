    "at tev energy scales , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) electro - weak ( ew ) effects produce leading corrections of the type @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the electro - magnetic coupling constant and @xmath5 the weinberg angle .",
    "in fact , for large enough @xmath6 values , the centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy at parton level , such ew effects may be competitive not only with next - to - nlo ( nnlo ) ( as @xmath7 ) but also with nlo qcd corrections ( e.g. , for @xmath8 tev , @xmath9 ) .",
    "these ` double logs ' are due to a lack of cancellation between virtual and real @xmath10-emission in higher order contributions .",
    "this is in turn a consequence of the violation of the bloch - nordsieck theorem in non - abelian theories @xcite .",
    "the problem is in principle present also in qcd . in practice",
    ", however , it has no observable consequences , because of the final averaging of the colour degrees of freedom of partons , forced by their confinement into colourless hadrons .",
    "this does not occur in the ew case , where the initial state has a non - abelian charge , as in an initial quark doublet in proton-(anti)proton scattering . besides , these logarithmic corrections are finite ( unlike in qcd ) , since @xmath11 provides a physical cut - off for @xmath10-emission . hence , for typical experimental resolutions ,",
    "softly and collinearly emitted weak bosons need not be included in the production cross section and one can restrict oneself to the calculation of weak effects originating from virtual corrections only . by doing so ,",
    "similar logarithmic effects , @xmath12 , are generated also by @xmath1-boson corrections .",
    "finally , all these purely weak contributions can be isolated in a gauge - invariant manner from em effects which therefore may not be included in the calculation .",
    "in fact , we have neglected the latter here .    in view of all this",
    ", it becomes of crucial importance to assess the quantitative relevance of such weak corrections affecting , in particular , key qcd processes at present and future hadron colliders .",
    "we show here results for the case of @xmath0-jet- , prompt - photon and @xmath1-production at tevatron and lhc .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : b ] ( left and right panels ) we show the effects of the full @xmath14 contributions to the @xmath15 and @xmath16 cross sections at tevatron and lhc , respectively .",
    "( for details of the calculation , see ref .  @xcite . )",
    "results are shown for the total inclusive @xmath0-jet production rate as a function of the jet transverse energy .",
    "( tree - level ew and nlo qcd effects are also given for comparison . ) at tevatron , @xmath14 terms are typically negligible in the inclusive cross section , as the partonic energy available is too small for the mentioned logarithms to be effective . at lhc , the contribution due to such terms grows accordingly to the collider energy , reaching the 2% level at transverse momenta of @xmath17 gev .",
    "next , we study the forward - backward asymmetry at tevatron , defined as follows : @xmath18-\\sigma_-[p\\bar p\\to b\\bar b(g ) ] }       { \\sigma_+[p\\bar p\\to b\\bar b(g)]+\\sigma_-[p\\bar p\\to b\\bar b(g)]},\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath19 identifies events in which the @xmath0-jet is produced with polar angle larger(smaller ) than 90 degrees respect to one of the two beam directions ( hereafter , we use the proton beam as positive @xmath20-axis ) .",
    "the polar angle is defined in the cm frame of the hard partonic scattering . in the center plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] , the solid curve represents the sum of the tree - level contributions , that is , those of order @xmath21 and @xmath22 , whereas the dashed one also includes the higher - order ones @xmath23 .",
    "the effects of the one - loop weak corrections on this observable are rather large , indeed comparable to the effects through order @xmath24 @xcite . in absolute terms , the asymmetry is of order @xmath25 at the @xmath10 , @xmath1 resonance ( i.e. , for @xmath26 ) and fractions of percent elsewhere , hence it should be measurable after the end of run 2 .",
    "we expect even larger effects at lhc , however , some care is here necessary in order to define the observable , which depends on the configuration and efficiency of the experimental apparata ( so we do not present the corresponding plot in this instance ) .",
    "the @xmath24 results presented here are from ref .",
    "the neutral - current processes ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30 are two of the cleanest probes of the partonic content of ( anti)protons , in particular of antiquark and gluon densities . in order to measure the latter",
    "it is necessary to study the vector boson @xmath31 spectrum . that is , to compute @xmath32 production in association with a jet ( originated by either a quark or a gluon ) .",
    "we briefly report here on the full one - loop results for processes ( [ procs_neutral ] ) obtained through @xmath33 .",
    "( for technical details of the calculation , see ref .",
    "@xcite . )    fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] shows the effects of the @xmath33 corrections relatively to the @xmath34 born results ( @xmath35 replaces @xmath36 for photons ) , as well as the absolute magnitude of the latter , as a function of the transverse momentum .",
    "the corrections are found to be rather large , both at tevatron and lhc , particularly for @xmath1-production . in case of the latter ,",
    "such effects are of order 10% at tevatron and 15% at lhc for @xmath37 gev . in general , above @xmath38 gev , they tend to ( negatively ) increase , more or less linearly , with @xmath31 . such effects are indeed observable at both tevatron and lhc .",
    "for example , at fnal , for @xmath1-production and decay into electrons and muons with br@xmath39 , assuming @xmath40 fb@xmath41 as integrated luminosity , in a window of 10 gev at @xmath42 gev , one finds 6506500 @xmath43 events through lo , hence a @xmath44 ew nlo correction corresponds to 10100 fewer events . at cern , for the same production and decay channel , assuming now @xmath45 fb@xmath41 , in a window of 40 gev at @xmath46 gev , we expect about 1200 @xmath43 events from lo , so that a @xmath47 ew nlo correction corresponds to 140 fewer events . in line with the normalisations seen in the top frames of fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] and the size of the corrections in the bottom ones , absolute rates for the photon are similar to those for the massive gauge boson while @xmath33 corrections are about a factor of two smaller .",
    "altogether , these results point to the relevance of one - loop @xmath33 contributions for precision analyses of prompt - photon and neutral drell - yan events at both tevatron and lhc , also recalling that the residual scale dependence of the known higher order qcd corrections to processes of the type ( [ procs_neutral ] ) is very small in comparison @xcite .",
    "another relevant aspect is that such higher order weak terms introduce parity - violating effects in hadronic observables @xcite , which can be observed at ( polarised ) rhic - spin @xcite .     for the @xmath48- and @xmath1-production cross sections at tevatron and lhc , as a function of the transverse momentum ( top ) as well as the size of the nlo corrections through @xmath33 relatively to the former.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the @xmath48- and @xmath1-production cross sections at tevatron and lhc , as a function of the transverse momentum ( top ) as well as the size of the nlo corrections through @xmath33 relatively to the former.,title=\"fig : \" ]     for the @xmath48- and @xmath1-production cross sections at tevatron and lhc , as a function of the transverse momentum ( top ) as well as the size of the nlo corrections through @xmath33 relatively to the former.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the @xmath48- and @xmath1-production cross sections at tevatron and lhc , as a function of the transverse momentum ( top ) as well as the size of the nlo corrections through @xmath33 relatively to the former.,title=\"fig : \" ]      m.  ciafaloni , p.  ciafaloni and d.  comelli , phys .",
