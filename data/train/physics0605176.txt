    "this behavior is accompanied by a depletion of the excited state , while the intermediate states continue to be equally populated . at the same time of the vanishing of one of the upper field amplitudes , the phase @xmath107 jumps from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and",

    "the upper field amplitudes tend to recover an equal value , but they decouple from the atoms once the lower field amplitudes have vanished .    an explanation of the phase jump from @xmath124 to @xmath118 is the tendency of the system to minimize the rate of dissipation in a way reminiscent of what is observed in four - wave mixing experiments where interference effects are generated in order to minimize spontaneous emission  @xcite .",
    "we also note that with increasing values of @xmath136 , the splitting of the upper fields for the same initial difference in their amplitudes is progressively delayed inside the medium and eventually disappears .          having identified and investigated two special values of the input phase , we now address the question , how the phase evolves starting from a generic input value , and correspondingly , how light propagates and is dissipated along the medium .",

    "although the lower field amplitudes are clearly damped for all values of @xmath136 , the mechanism of radiation dissipation depends on @xmath136 and on the initial strengths of the field amplitudes .",
    "this can be associated with a particular evolution of the phase along the medium , which in the cases displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase:0 ] reaches the stable value @xmath124 , and in the cases displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase : pi ] tends first to the value @xmath13 before eventually reaching @xmath124 .",

    "[ fig : phase:0 ] all atomic transitions are driven at saturation , and the saturation of the upper transitions is larger or equal to that of the lower transitions .",

    "once @xmath124 , the rate of damping of the lower field amplitudes changes abruptly to a lower value . this sudden change occurs at a propagation length determined by the typical absorption length of the fast decaying transition .",
    "the system simulates a v - configuration , thereby switching to an eit - like response . a similar kind of behavior is also observed in a medium of the double-@xmath1 atoms where eit - coherences are established between the two stable states  @xcite . in the @xmath0 configuration",
    "the coherences and interferences are transient  @xcite . for a slower decay of the excited state , however",
    ", the system can also switch to a @xmath128-dynamics and exhibit a transient coherence between ground and excited states .",
    "a manifestation of this phenomenon is population inversion between the excited and the intermediate states along the medium in fig .",

    "[ fig : phase : pi ] the lower transitions are driven well above saturation , and the corresponding saturation parameter is larger than the saturation parameter of the upper fields . here , during a transient regime the phase slowly tends to @xmath118 . nonetheless , the tendency of the medium for long propagation lengths is to eventually decouple upper fields and atoms , i.e. to switch to a v - dynamics .",
    "the onset of this dynamics depends critically on the value of @xmath159 , which must well saturate the lower transitions with respect to @xmath153 in order to populate the intermediate states on a time scale shorter than their decay rate , but long enough for incoherent decay of the upper state to take place .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with sec .  [",
    "sec : stable ] , showing that when the lower transitions are driven well above saturation the value @xmath118 is the only stable phase under amplitude and phase fluctuations .",
    "so far , we have considered input fields with equal lower and upper field amplitudes .",
    "we now discuss propagation when one field is initially very weak while the other three transitions are driven at or above saturation , and study how the dynamics of energy redistribution among the fields depends on the input parameters and on the stability of the excited state .    figures  [ fig:4wave ] and  [ fig:4wave:2 ] display the field propagation when the upper field amplitude @xmath186 is very small and the phase is initially set to the value @xmath187 . in both figures we have assumed the excited state to decay slower than the intermediate states , but one may also observe amplification of the weak field under different conditions . in fig .

    "after this point the behavior changes and @xmath195 first increases slightly and then decays slowly as a function of @xmath149 in a way similar to @xmath193 , while the upper field amplitudes remain constant .",
    "the final configuration supports a coherence between the excited and the ground state , and indeed for @xmath124 and this value of @xmath136 the dynamics can be mapped to a @xmath128-level scheme . in particular , due to destructive interference , the fields are only weakly coupled to the transitions and the medium is semitransparent .",
