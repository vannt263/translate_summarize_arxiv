    "to utilise the negative resistance of a jj for amplification , stable operation has to be maintained by sufficient damping at all frequencies .",
    "the frequency - dependent damping is set in such a way that the external shunt damps the low ( @xmath28 , the signal frequency ) and high ( @xmath29 ) frequency dynamics , which ensures both stable dc bias and overdamped josephson dynamics . in practice",
    ", we have realised this separation by mounting the shunt resistor in series with a bandstop filter whose center frequency is at the signal frequency @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the shunt capacitor is chosen large enough that it acts as a short at the josephson frequency to ensure the high frequency dynamics and the iv curve are not modified .",
    "the stabilization in the stop band is provided by the postamplification circuit .",
    "the shunt circuit and the postamplification circuit together guarantee the stability of the device by generating a wide - band resistive environment for the jj .",
    "operated as a reflection amplifier , the power gain @xmath31 is determined by the reflection coefficient @xmath32where @xmath33 is the impedance of the jj , the shunt and the series inductance ; @xmath34 is the impedance of the readout circuit . as seen from the curve in fig .",
    "1b , there is gain ( @xmath35 db ) at all values of negative resistance and a strong divergence around @xmath36 . in the stopband of the shunt circuit ,",
    "the input impedance @xmath37 consists of the jj ( and possibly of an lc impedance transformer ) : it is real and negative . for @xmath38 , large gain with stable operation can be obtained . for operating conditions where",

    "the dynamics of squid circuits can be analyzed using a langevin type of differential equation for the phase variable @xmath42 across the josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "good agreement of such langevin analysis with measured experimental results has been obtained in the past @xcite . in the semiclassical approach ,",
    "the generalized nyquist noise formula by callen and welton @xcite with the frequency dependence @xmath43 is employed as the colored noise source in the differential equation @xcite . at the josephson frequency , the semiclassical noise power per unit bandwidth is so large ( @xmath44 ) that , after downmixing , it will have observable effects on the phase dynamics at the signal frequency @xmath10 . since the noise at @xmath45 is cut off from the josephson junction by the bandstop filter ( see fig .",
    "1c ) , direct noise from the shunt is avoided and only the down - mixed noise is present in our device .",
    "the absence of direct noise ensures good noise characteristics for our sja and this feature is one of the basic differences when comparing sjas with traditional microwave squid amplifiers .",
    "[ figyy ] displays noise spectra measured on the device at different bias points . at low bias currents ,",
    "the magnitude of the dynamic resistance @xmath46 is smaller than the environmental impedance in parallel to it , making the total damping impedance of the lc resonator in the shunt circuit negative .",
    "this leads to either spontaneous oscillations or saturation .",
    "the oscillations are highly nonlinear , which is manifested as higher harmonics in the spectra .",
    "the saturation shows up as vanishing response .",
    "as @xmath46 increases at higher bias points , the system is stabilized and the harmonics disappear since the device operates as a linear amplifier generating amplified noise at the output .     and the power scale on the right is given in db .",

    "<S> the present device differs markedly from previous implementations using unshunted josephson devices due to the modified impedance environment .    </S>",
    "<S> unshunted junctions are attractive as low - noise devices since they minimize fluctuations by avoiding unnecessary dissipation in the junction environment . in voltage - biased ( @xmath9 ) operation </S>",
    "<S> , these devices can be considered as mixers between the signal frequency ( @xmath10 around a few ghz ) and the josephson frequency ( @xmath11 ghz ) including sidebands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a frequency - dependent environmental impedance can be employed for controlling mixing strengths ( because the josephson junction is a phase driven current generator ) and the impedance makes the conversion between these two quantities . </S>"
