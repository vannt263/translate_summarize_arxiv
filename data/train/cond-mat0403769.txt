    "there are many slowly driven extended dissipative systems in nature which organize themselves to a critical state .",
    "these are called self organized critical ( soc ) systems .",
    "such systems show long - ranged spatial and temporal correlations , i.e. , power law behaviour in the correlation functions ; for example , the frequency of earthquakes as a function of energy released , the mean square velocity difference as a function of distance in the turbulant fluids , height - height correlation in the case of surface roughening of growing interfaces  @xcite .",
    "the time series of electrical noise shows power law in the power spectrum ( `` @xmath9 '' noise )  @xcite .",
    "sandpile models are the simplest models where important features of self organized critical ( soc ) states are present .",
    "abelian sandpile model is a subclass of these .",
    "there are many papers  @xcite concerned mainly in studying the distributions of avalanche sizes and avalanche durations and the corresponding critical exponents , but there is not much work in the literature where the distribution of times these grains spend inside the system has been studied theoretically .",
    "although it has been studied in an experiment on ricepiles and in simulation in one dimension  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the residence time distribution of a marked sand grain , when the system is driven by adding sand grains at one end ( say , left ) .",
    "our model is btw sandpile model  @xcite in 1-dimension which is simplest to study .",
    "we find out the scaling form to be @xmath10 for large @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the residence time and @xmath1 is the size of the system .",
    "this scaling function @xmath11 , although it diverges as @xmath12 , is consistent with the normalization condition , since lower limit of @xmath13 has a cutoff at @xmath14 .",
    "the residence time distribution decays exponentially for large value of @xmath0 .",
    "we determine numerically the coefficient , @xmath5 , of @xmath15 in the exponential decay for some finite sizes of the 1-diemnsional lattice .",
    "we take an one dimensional lattice of @xmath1 sites where sites are indexed by @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the configuration of the sandpile is specified by height variable ( number of sand grains ) @xmath18 at any site @xmath16 .",
    "the dynamics is as follows .",
    "whenever the height is higher than some critical value @xmath19 , the site topples and two sand grains go to the nearest neighbour sites , one goes to the left and the other goes to the right .",
    "which one goes to the left is chosen at random .",
    "here we consider both @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "there is one layer of sand grains for @xmath20 . for @xmath21 , there are two layers of grains . when the height of the end site at @xmath22 or @xmath23 crosses the critical height , the site topples .",
    "one sand grain goes out of the system and other goes to the next neighbour site .",
    "no sand is added till the system comes to the stable configuration , i.e. , there is no more topplings in the system .",
    "the time unit is measured as the duration between the successive addition of two sand grains .",
    "the residence time of a sand grain is defined as the time spent by that grain inside the system .",
    "@xmath24 is the probability distribution function of the residence time @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of sites in the 1-dimensoinal lattice .",
    "+ first we consider the model with critical height @xmath20 and start from the configuration with the height @xmath25 at all sites .",
    "now we keep on adding sand grain at the leftmost site . after first addition of grain",
    ", there is no toppling .",
    "then we add the next sand grain .",
    "now there will be toppling , one sand grain will leave the system , other grain will move to the right and stays there until next grain comes to the site , and so on .",
    "so the evolution rule is totally deterministic . after some time ( @xmath26 )",
    "the system falls into a cycle .",
    "this cycle , consisting of @xmath27 stable configurations , has at most one site with @xmath28 and other sites with @xmath29 ( recurrent configuration space ) . in the steady state of the system , all the configurations are equally probable .",
    "+ of the @xmath27 recurrent configurations , @xmath1 configurations have a site with zero height and one configuration has all sites with height @xmath30 .",
    "if there is a configuration which has @xmath16-th site with zero height , in the next time step the configuration changes to one which has @xmath31-th site with height zero ( if @xmath22 , in the next step all heights become @xmath30 ) . at the next time step ,",
    "the @xmath32-th site is with height zero . after some time there is 1st site with zero height .",
    "when next sand grain is added , all sites become with height @xmath30 . in the next step , last site becomes with height zero and so on .",
    "even though time evolution of the system is completely deterministic , movement of sand grains is stochastic .",
    "whenever any site topples , one of the two sand grains goes to the left nearest neighbour and stops , and other grain moves to the right nearest neighbour . the probability that one particular grain of the two goes to the left and other goes to the right is @xmath33 .",
    "if the height at the right site is zero , toppling stops , otherwise , there is another toppling .",
    "if any sand grain falls on the site with height zero , it stops moving and waits till the site with height zero is at the left of it .",
    "when the @xmath1-th site has the height zero , the sand grain starts moving again in the similar fashion .",
    "the waiting times are not same at every site and waiting times are correlated .",
    "first we shall discuss the case for @xmath20 .",
    "when the residence time @xmath0 is very small compared to @xmath1 , sand grains always get ejected from the left and do not go beyond the site @xmath34 ( except for the case when @xmath29 at all sites at time @xmath0 and grain might be ejected from the right end ) .",
    "it s very unlikely that the marked sand grain meets the site with height zero ( the probability @xmath35 which goes to zero for large value of @xmath1 ) . in the limit of @xmath1 large",
    "compared to @xmath0 , the residence time distribution is well approximated by the distribution of the first passage ( at @xmath22 ) time of a simple unbiased random walker with @xmath36 steps random walk .",
    "so , for @xmath37 , we can exactly calculate the residence time distribution  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath24 is the probability that the marked sand grain gets ejected from the system immediatly after time @xmath0 . using sterling approximation to the above expression",
    ", we get the function @xmath24 equals to @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "now we can extend our result whenever @xmath2 .",
    "the argument is as follows .",
    "after time steps @xmath41 where @xmath42 , the standard deviation of the position of the marked sand grain goes as @xmath43 .",
    "so the probability that the marked grain will meet the site with height zero goes as @xmath44 which will tend to zero in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "therefore for any @xmath45 , the limiting probability distribution @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath46 , the first passage ( at @xmath22 ) time distribution of a simple unbiased random walker with @xmath36 steps random walk . for the large value of @xmath0",
    "the distribution function decays exponentially like @xmath47 where @xmath5 depends on lattice size .",
    "later we will describe how to compute the coefficient @xmath5 for any finite @xmath1 . + even though we do nt know the distribution function for all @xmath0 , we can find out the first moment of the residence time distribution easily .",
    "we define mass of the sandpile as the total number of particles in the pile ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) .",
    "it s easy to see that mean residence time @xmath49 . to prove this ,",
    "let us define an indicator funtion @xmath50 as given below .",
    "@xmath51 @xmath52    the mean residence time can be written as @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 the average of the total mass in the pile is @xmath56 $ ] which goes as @xmath1 for large @xmath1 .",
    "+ we find out the scaling form of the function @xmath24 using the mean residence time and the previous limiting distribution .",
    "the scaling finction @xmath11 is defined as @xmath57 so the form of the distribution function @xmath24 is @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath24 varies as @xmath46 for @xmath40 , @xmath11 must goes as @xmath58 for very small value of @xmath13 and therefore @xmath7 goes as @xmath59 . as @xmath24 is independent of @xmath1 for @xmath40 , we get @xmath60 . even though the scaling function @xmath11 is divergent as @xmath13 tends to zero",
    ", we can normalize @xmath24 without any problem , since @xmath13 has lower cutoff @xmath61 .",
    "as @xmath11 goes as @xmath58 , the normalisation integral is @xmath62 which is independent of @xmath1 as @xmath60 .",
    "the mean residemce time @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 as there is no divergence in the integrand , we can put the lower limit in the integration zero .",
    "since @xmath65 , we find @xmath66 and therefore can write the scaling form of the @xmath24 as @xmath67 for large @xmath1 . in fig.1 .",
    "probability distributions , @xmath24 , of residence time of sand grains are plotted for different lattice sizes @xmath68 . in fig.2 .",
    "all the curves for @xmath24 collapse to a single curve when we plot @xmath69 against @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath99\\ ] ]    the transition matrix @xmath100 gives back the initial configuration after the period of time @xmath27 .",
    "the superscript in @xmath101 is denoting that the marked grain is added when the initial configuration is with @xmath102 . in general ,",
    "if the grain is added with the initial configuration where position of the site with heigt zero is at @xmath103 , the transition matrix will be @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "the different values of @xmath85 in transition matrices correspod to the addition of sand grains to the configurations with different sites with height zero . to find out the coefficient @xmath5 in the exponential , we diagonalize any matrix @xmath106 , say @xmath101 , and take the largest eigenvalue , @xmath107 .",
    "we diagonalise any one matrix of the different transitoin matrices because the eigen values for the different transitoin matrices , @xmath106s ( we get various @xmath106s just with cyclic permutation of matrices @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 .... @xmath111 etc . ) are same . for large value of time",
    "@xmath0 ( @xmath112 ) , the residence time distribution decays exponentially like @xmath113 which equals to @xmath114 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath5 is then @xmath115 . in the fig.3 .",
    "we have plotted @xmath5 against the number of sites in the 1-dimensional lattice , @xmath1 .",
    "it shows that @xmath5 saturates to the value of @xmath71 .",
    "so the coefficient is independent of lattice size @xmath1 for large value of @xmath1 .",
    "+   +         showing collapse of all the curves for differnet lattice sizes to a single curve . ]",
    "versus lattice size l ]    we can easily extend all our previous result for @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "the toppling rules for @xmath21 are similar to the previous case @xmath20 except that sand grain can stay at the site even if there is a toppling .",
    "whenever height at any site is three , the site gets unstable and topples .",
    "one sand grain of the three goes to right nearest neighbour site , one goes to the left nearest neighbour site and the other one stays put .",
    "it is decided at random which one goes to the right , which one goes to the left .",
    "the probablity that a particular grain of the three going to the right or to the left , or staying there is @xmath116 .",
    "the height of any site is either @xmath30 or @xmath117 , when the system is stable . in the steady state , at most one site has height @xmath30 and all the others have height @xmath117 .",
    "all configurations in the recurrent configuration space are equally probable .",
    "the number of recurrent configuratins is same as before .",
    "the residence time distribution @xmath24 , for @xmath40 , is @xmath118 here also we can extend this result for @xmath45 , just as we did in the case for @xmath20 . the probability distribution functin has the same scaling form as for @xmath20 .    to calculate the coefficient @xmath5",
    ", we can construct the trasition probability matrix exactly in the similar way for the previous case .",
    "in this case the number of basis states is @xmath1 and @xmath5 can be determined as before .",
    "in summary , we have calculated probability distribution of the residence time @xmath0 in two limitting cases @xmath2 and @xmath3 , have shown that the distribution function has a scaling form @xmath10 and computed the coefficient of @xmath15 , @xmath5 , in the exponential decay of the distribution function for the values of @xmath1 upto @xmath6 .",
