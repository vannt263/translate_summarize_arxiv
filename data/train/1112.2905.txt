    "graphene , a single sheet of carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice has attracted enormous interest since its experimental discovery and isolation.@xcite its quasiparticle states behave like massless relativistic  dirac fermions gaim , nov3 and obey a two - dimensional dirac equation , where the light speed is replaced by the fermi velocity that is 300 times smaller than speed of light in vacuum . beside various applications in electronic devices ,",
    "graphene physics opens wide research field unifying low - energy condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics ( qed).gqed1,gqed2,gqed4,gqed5,gqed6 many fundamental nonlinear qed processes , specifically , electron - positron pair production in superstrong laser fields of ultrarelativistic intensities , @xcite observation of which is problematic yet even in the current superintense laser fields , have their counterparts in graphene where considerably weaker electromagnetic fields are required for experimental realization of antimatter  production from vacuum . in this connection",
    "one can note klein paradox , @xcite schwinger mechanism @xcite and zitterbewegung @xcite for particle - hole excitation , as well as diverse physical and applied effects based on zitterbewegung , e.g. , minimal conductivity at vanishing carrier concentration @xcite etc .",
    "due to massless energy spectrum the compton wavelength for graphene quasiparticle tends to infinity . on the other hand , in qed",
    "the compton wavelength is characteristic length for particle - antiparticle pair creation and annihilation .",
    "so , at the interaction of an electromagnetic field with an intrinsic graphene there is not a quasiclassical limit , since no matter how weak the applied field is and how small the photon energy is , the particle - hole pairs will be created during the whole interaction process -at arbitrary distances .    in graphene wave - particle interaction",

    "the average intensity of the wave expressed by @xmath8 , can be estimated as:@xmath9^{4}.\\]]depending on the value of this parameter @xmath8 ,  one can distinguish three different regimes in the wave - particle interaction process .",
    "thus ,  @xmath10 corresponds to one - photon interaction regime , @xmath11  to multiphoton interaction regime , and @xmath12 corresponds to static field limit or schwinger regime .",
    "as is seen , the intensity @xmath13 strongly depends on the photon energy . particularly , for infrared photons : @xmath14 @xmath15 , multiphoton interaction regime can be achieved at the intensities @xmath16 .",
    "note that in case of free electrons at the same photon energies multiphoton effects take place at the intensities @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite such a huge difference , as well as the gapless particle - hole energy spectrum in graphene makes realistic another interesting nonlinear qed process : multiphoton excitation of dirac vacuum with rabi oscillations at ultrafast excitation .",
    "@xcite    in the present work the creation of particle - hole coupled states in graphene via multiphoton resonant excitation by laser fields is studied .",
    "it is well known that rabi oscillation of states populations is the coherent response of two - level atomic systems under resonant excitation .",
    "the one - photon resonant excitation of atoms and associated rabi oscillations have been comprehensively studied both theoretically and experimentally and described in numerous review articles and books ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similar phenomena have also been observed in semiconductors.@xcite recently , the rabi oscillations in graphene  at one - photon interband excitation ( at @xmath18 ) and its influence on the dynamic conductivity were investigated in refs .",
    "[ ] . on the other hand , at a wave - particle interaction in graphene due to free - free intraband transitions we have a situation analogous to resonant excitation of quantum systems with permanent dipole moments , where direct multiphoton transitions are very effective.@xcite hence , it is of interest the creation of particle - hole coupled states in graphene via multiphoton resonant excitation .",
    "this process apart from fundamental interest may also have practical applications .",
    "in particular , particle - hole annihilation from coherent superposition states will cause intense coherent radiation of harmonics of the applied wave - field .",
    "we consider multiphoton interaction regime at @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , the time evolution of considered process is found using a nonperturbative resonant approach arising from the quantum kinetic equations .",

    "let graphene interacts with a plane quasimonochromatic laser radiation of carrier frequency @xmath19 and slowly varying envelope . to clarify the picture of stated in this paper problem for creation of coherent superposition states",
    ", we consider the case of interaction when the laser wave propagates in perpendicular direction to graphene plane ( @xmath20 ) to exclude the effect of magnetic field .",
    "this travelling wave for electrons in graphene becomes a homogeneous time - periodic electric field .",

    ", the physical picture of resonant wave - graphene interaction will be more transparent in the length gauge .",
