    "sources for the kerr metric have been sought for long , but with little success .",
    "the only known exact solution that can be matched to the kerr metric seems to be the rotating dust disk , with maximal allowed angular momentum , found by neugebauer and meinel @xcite . some numerical studies with different equations of state for the source find quadrupole moments differing from that of the kerr metric , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in some recent papers @xcite it is shown that in the rigidly rotating case incompressible fluids and fluids with polytropic equation of state can not be sources of the kerr metric in the post - minkowskian limit .",
    "these results are in accordance with the general expectation that the ellipsoidal shape of the rotating fluid ball produces an extra contribution to the quadrupole moment which should also be present in the corresponding quadrupole moment of the external field @xcite . for a general review of relativistic rotating stars",
    "see @xcite .    in the present work we use the second order formalism for slowly and rigidly rotating stars , developed by hartle @xcite , to study the quadrupole moment and its deviation from that of the kerr metric for different classes of possible equations of state .",
    "for some earlier applications of the formalism see , e.g. , @xcite and for a comparison with numerical solutions of the full einstein equations see @xcite .",
    "the relativistic multipole moments of the vacuum exterior metric up to order two are calculated using an algorithm developed in @xcite .",
    "the field equations for the fluid region to second order in the small rotational parameter @xmath0 will be solved numerically using fourth order runge - kutta .",
    "when imposing an equation of state this system can be rewritten as a first order system of ordinary differential equations for nine functions , but a subsystem for six of these functions will be sufficient to study for our purposes .",
    "assuming regularity at the centre the solutions will depend on three constants of integration , corresponding to zeroth order central density or pressure , the magnitude of the angular velocity and one more second order small constant .",
    "if the solutions are required to be asymptotically flat this second order constant will be determined in terms of the other constants . due to scaling invariance in the angular velocity",
    "it may be given a fixed value in the numerical runs .",
    "hence , given an equation of state , we need only vary the central pressure or density when scanning the solution space .",
    "the solutions are then matched to a second order axisymmetric vacuum solution using the darmois - israel procedure @xcite .",
    "this metric includes the general second order asymptotically flat stationary axisymmetric vacuum solution as a special case .",
    "we also consider the post - minkowskian limit analytically by expanding the field equations in the small parameter @xmath1 and make a comparison with the results of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ preliminaries ] the method is briefly described and the field equations are presented . also the second order vacuum metric is given and its relativistic multipole moments up to order two are calculated .",
    "the matching procedure is described in section [ matching ] and the integration constants for the vacuum solution are solved for in terms of the values of the interior solution on the matching surface . in section [ newvariables ]",
    "the equations are rewritten in a form suitable for numerical integration .",
    "the results of the numerical runs are given in section [ numericalsolutions ] and finally a post - minkowskian analysis is made in section [ post ] .",
