    "configuration spaces of closed linkages in euclidean space modulo isometry group have occured in many contexts in recent years .",
    "planar linkages can easily be visualised and the topology of the resulting moduli spaces are now well understood , culminating in the proof of the walker conjecture by farber , hausmann and the author in @xcite .",
    "roughly this conjecture states that the cohomology of the linkage space detects the length vector of the linkage . by a _ length vector _ we simply mean an element @xmath5 such that all entries are positive . the @xmath6-th entry @xmath7 describes the length of the @xmath6-th link . _ _    for linkages in 3-dimensional euclidean space , the resulting moduli spaces occur naturally in algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry , see e.g.  @xcite , and the cohomology rings have been calculated in hausmann and knutson @xcite . using this description of cohomology ,",
    "the analogue of the walker conjecture was proven in @xcite , with the single exception that for @xmath8 there exist two different length vectors whose moduli spaces are both the 2-sphere",
    ".    much less is known for linkages in higher - dimensional euclidean spaces . for linkages in 5-dimensional space ,",
    "foth and lozano obtained analogous results of kapovich and millson @xcite in a quaternion setting rather than a complex one .",
    "kamiyama @xcite obtained an euler characteristic formula for equilateral linkages in 4-dimensional space , and more recently homology calculations were obtained in @xcite .",
    "the moduli space we are interested in is @xmath9 where @xmath10 acts diagonally on the product of spheres .",
    "in particular we want to know how the topology of @xmath0 depends on the length vector @xmath11 . permuting the coordinates of @xmath11 does not change the topology as we can simply permute the coordinates of @xmath0 .",
    "it also turns out that small changes of @xmath11 do not change the topology , provided that @xmath11 does not admit a collinear configuration , that is , if @xmath12 . if this is the case , we call the length vector _ generic__. _ _ _    indeed , the non - generic length vectors are the boundaries of so - called chambers , connected open subsets of @xmath13 such that any two length vectors in the same chamber admit homeomorphic moduli spaces .    in general ,",
    "if two length vectors @xmath11 , @xmath14 are in different chambers , even after permuting coordinates , it does not necessarily follow that @xmath0 and @xmath15 are not homeomorphic .",
    "in fact , schoenberg @xcite showed that for @xmath16 the moduli space @xmath0 is either a topological disc or empty , from which it can be seen that for @xmath17 the moduli spaces are empty or topologically a sphere .",
    "the case where the moduli space is empty is represented by the chamber where one coordinate @xmath18 is bigger than the sum of all other @xmath7 , so in all other cases we always get the same moduli space .",
    "notice that the case @xmath19 reduces to the case @xmath16 , as the extra dimensions in @xmath20 can not be taken advantage of by linear dependence of the @xmath21 .    in the case",
    "@xmath22 the topology of the moduli space does depend on the chamber , as can be seen from the homology calculations in @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper shows that for a large class of length vectors the topology of the moduli space does recover the chamber of the length vector .",

    "it is clear from the calculations in @xcite that ordinary cohomology is not enough for @xmath23 .",
    "instead we use intersection homology in this paper . by letting the perversity vary with the degree of the intersection homology group , we can use the intersection pairing to assign a ring to each moduli space which behaves very similar to the cohomology ring in the case @xmath27 . for",
    "even @xmath23 we can explicitely describe this ring and use it to prove theorem [ main_theorem ] .",
    "the idea of the ring based on intersection homology is roughly the following . given @xmath34 with @xmath35 we can form a new length vector @xmath36 by merging the links corresponding to the elements of @xmath37 into one link . this leads to an inclusion @xmath38 . furthermore , if @xmath39 , the intersection @xmath40 is transversal .",
