    "rapid progress has been made recently in computations of the free energy density , at nonzero temperature @xmath2 , of massless @xmath3 theory @xcite , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , to three - loop ( fourth order in coupling ) . for qed ,",
    "the fifth @xmath4 order contribution has also been obtained @xcite by dressing the photon lines of the three - loop diagrams .",
    "compared to qed , a fifth order calculation in qcd will be more involved because gluonic self - interactions imply that many more lines in any three - loop diagram can be soft ( i.e. at zero matsubara frequency in the imaginary time formalism ) , and so must be dressed in order to obtain the full @xmath0 contribution . in this respect",
    "a fifth order calculation in qcd will resemble the same order calculation in @xmath1 theory . in this paper",
    "we will compute the order @xmath5 contribution to the pressure of massless @xmath1 theory and show that by an optimal choice of rearranged lagrangian it is possible to obtain analytical results without too much effort .    the theory we are concerned with is defined by the euclidean lagrangian    _ 0= 1 2 ( ) ^2 + g^2 ^2 4 !",
    "^4 , [ 1.1 ] where @xmath6 is the mass scale of dimensional regularisation(@xmath7 ) .",
    "we use the imaginary time formalism in which the energies take discrete values , @xmath8 , @xmath9 . for perturbative calculations beyond leading order ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account in a systematic manner the non - negligible collective effects @xcite .",
    "for the theory defined by eq.([1.1 ] ) this means that one uses instead the shifted lagrangian @xcite    ^_0 = ( _ 0 + 12 m^2 ^2 ) -12 m^2 ^2 [ 1.2 ] with @xmath10 the thermal mass generated at one - loop .",
    "the term within brackets in eq.([1.2 ] ) defines a dressed propagator while the last term is a new two - point vertex which prevents overcounting . with eq.([1.2 ] ) one can proceed to calculate any green s function in the theory , order by order , in a consistent way .",
    "however for the calculation of green s functions with _ static _",
    "( zero energy ) external legs , eq.([1.2 ] ) is not very economical since it involves some extraneous resummation .",
    "recall ( see , for example , @xcite ) that for a static green s function , its physical definition is already given in imaginary time , without the need to analytically continue to real time .",
    "thus the power counting of infrared ( ir ) divergences may be safely done using the euclidean propagators with discrete energies .",
    "then , only the propagators at zero matsubara frequency do not have an ir cut - off of order @xmath11 , and it is only for these zero modes that the thermal mass @xmath12 is a relevant infrared cut - off .",
    "thus instead of eq.([1.2 ] ) one can use    = ( _ 0 + 12 m^2 ^2 _ p_0,0 ) - 12 m^2 ^2 _ p_0,0 [ 1.3 ] for _ static _ calculations , with @xmath13 the energy in fourier space of @xmath14 . the lagrangian in eq.([1.3 ] ) is precisely what is suggested by the braaten - pisarski @xcite resummation scheme whiu involves dressing soft lines with hard - thermal loops. for the calculation of _ static _ quantities in _ imaginary time _ , the only soft - line is the zero - mode propagator and the only hard - thermal loop is the static one - loop thermal mass .",
    "we remark that a resummation as in eq.([1.3 ] ) , which involves dressing only the zero - modes , was used very effectively by arnold and co - workers @xcite for their free energy calculations in gauge theories , but they used the more general expression ( [ 1.2 ] ) ( as in ref.@xcite ) for their scalar free - energy calculation .",
    "the advantage of using minimal resummation ( [ 1.3 ] ) also for the scalar case can be seen by the following example .",
    "the propagator from eq.([1.3 ] ) is    \\(k ) + _ k_0,0k^2 + m^2 .",
    "[ 1.4 ] then the one - loop integral    \\(k ) & = & + t(dk)1k^2 + m^2 [ 1.5 ] + & = & 1 2 ^d-5 2 t^d-2 ( 3-d )  ( 3-d 2 ) + t 4 ( m^2 4)^d-3 2  ( 3-d 2 ) , where we have used the notation t _ k_0 ( * even ) * ( dk ) t _ k_0 ( * even ) * , with @xmath15 . notice that the integrals in eq.([1.5 ] ) were computable in closed form and the result is a term of order @xmath16 and another of order @xmath17 .",
    "since the bosonic one - loop integral ( [ 1.5 ] ) and others related to it occur frequently in figs.1(a - g ) , one easily sees that all those diagrams may be evaluated easily .",
    "by contrast the propagator of eq.([1.2 ] ) is @xmath18 and its one - loop integral is only available as a high temperature expansion @xcite , making the evaluation of the diagrams of theory ( [ 1.2 ] ) more involved .",
    "another point that needs clarifying is the choice of @xmath19 in eq.([1.3 ] ) . in four dimensions , @xmath20 .",
    "however since we are using dimensional regularisation , one might wonder if the value of @xmath19 in @xmath21-dimensions should be used .",
    "for example , in @xcite the value @xmath22 was used ( it being the hard thermal loop in @xmath23 dimensions ) , while in @xcite the full one - loop value in @xmath21-dimensions was used .",
    "will these different choices affect the final result ?",
    "if one is interested in renormalised values as @xmath24 , the answer is no .",
    "here is the proof : let the resummation in eq.([1.3 ] ) be done using some @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "now keep the @xmath27 - dependence of @xmath25 implicit , even when it hits @xmath28 terms . since the full lagrangian in eq.([1.3 ] )",
    "is massless , no ultra - violet mass renormalisation is needed in perturbative calculations using dimensional regularisation .",
    "therefore any @xmath29 terms generated when calculating a renormalised quantity ( i.e. after including coupling - constant renormalisation ) must mutually cancel .",
    "finally only terms of the form @xmath30 @xmath31 will appear and then , as @xmath24 , only @xmath32 survives .",
    "end of proof .",
    "in explicit calculations one finds that if the @xmath27-dependence of @xmath33 is expanded out then extra finite ( @xmath34 ) terms are generated from some diagrams because of the @xmath35-dependence of the mass in the propagator , but these will cancel , order by order in @xmath17 , with similar terms generated from @xmath35-dependence of the thermal counterterm .",
    "the fact that one can use @xmath32 rather than some @xmath33 clearly simplifies calculations and avoids redundant cancellations .",
    "on the other hand one can exploit the proof in the last paragraph to provide a cross - check on calculations .",
    "that is , one can use @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is an _ arbitrary",
    "_ regular function of @xmath35 ( which may also depend on @xmath17 and @xmath38 ) , in eq.([1.3 ] ) and verify that one s final renormalised result is independent of @xmath37 as @xmath39 .",
    "such a check had been performed @xcite for the pole of the propagator of @xmath1 theory to two - loop @xcite , and we have also done it for the calculations in this paper .",
    "however in order to emphasize the simplicity of using @xmath32 , we will present here the results for this case only .    in the next section",
    "we reconsider the calculations of the pressure to order @xmath40 using eq.([1.3 ] ) and recover the results of @xcite .",
    "then in section - iii the @xmath0 terms are obtained and the results are summarised in section - iv .",
    "we conclude with some comments in section - v .",

    "we reconsider those @xmath40 terms using the minimal lagrangian , eq.([1.3 ] ) , with @xmath42 .",
