    "( `` renormalizing the metric '' means that we are allowed to rescale the metric on each factor of @xmath5 by multiplying by a positive constant . )    in the early eighties , eberlein , gromov and heintze independently proved generalizations of mostow s theorem in which the hypotheses on @xmath0 are weakened .",

    "if @xmath5 is of rank one , then the sectional curvature of @xmath1 is strictly negative and hence , the same will be true for any sufficiently small deformation of its metric ; moreover , the new metric will not , in general , be isometric to the original one . )",
    "eberlein proved the above generalization of the rigidity theorem in the case where @xmath5 is reducible and the uniform lattice @xmath3 is irreducible .",
    "we shall sometimes refer to this as `` eberlein s case '' .",
    "gromov proved the result in full generality ; however , the argument has only appeared ( in @xcite ) in the case where @xmath5 is irreducible .    in this paper",
    "we will prove a further generalization of eberlein s case of the rigidity theorem by allowing a further weakening of the hypotheses on @xmath0 : the metric need not be smooth . to explain this , we first need to understand what `` nonpositive curvature '' means in this context .",
    "about fifty years ago aleksandrov showed that the notions of upper or lower curvature bounds make sense for a more general class of metric spaces than riemannian manifolds , namely , they make sense for `` geodesic spaces '' .",
    "geodesic segment _ in a metric space @xmath10 is the image of an isometric embedding of an interval into @xmath10 ; the space @xmath10 is a _ geodesic space _ if any two points can be connected by a geodesic segment .",
    "a _ triangle _ in @xmath10 is a configuration of three points ( the vertices ) and three geodesic segments ( the edges ) connecting them .",
    "following aleksandrov , one defines @xmath10 to be _ nonpositively curved _ if the distance between any two points in any small triangle in @xmath10 is no greater than the distance between the corresponding points of a comparison triangle in the euclidean plane .",
    "( the precise definition will be given in section 1.1 , below . )    the weakened hypotheses on @xmath0 will then be that it is a complete geodesic space , that it is nonpositively curved in the above sense and that it is a closed topological manifold .",
    "our interest in generalizing the rigidity theorem to the singular case arose from an attempt to answer the following basic question concerning nonpositively curved , polyhedral metrics on manifolds . given a riemannian manifold @xmath11 of nonpositive sectional curvature ,",
    "is it possible to find a piecewise euclidean , polyhedral metric on @xmath11 which is nonpositively curved in aleksandrov s sense ?",
    "an application of our rigidity result is that this is , in fact , impossible when @xmath12 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath0 were a nonpositively curved polyhedron homeomorphic to @xmath1 , then by the rigidity theorem it would be isometric to @xmath1 , which is clearly impossible ( since @xmath0 contains open subsets which are flat and @xmath1 does not ) .",
    "a further discussion of the problem of approximating nonpositively curved riemannian metrics by nonpositively curved polyhedral ones will be given in section 1 .",
    "next we shall make a few remarks concerning the proofs of mostow and eberlein . since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are eilenberg ",
    "maclane spaces , the isomorphism @xmath13 gives rise to a homotopy equivalence @xmath14 .",
    "this lifts to a @xmath7equivariant map @xmath15 . by analyzing the maximal flats in @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ", mostow first shows that @xmath16 extends to a homeomorphism of the maximal ( or furstenberg ) boundaries .",
    "( the maximal boundary of @xmath5 is a homogeneous space of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the identity component of the isometry group @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a minimal parabolic subgroup . )",
    "let @xmath21 be the de rham decomposition into irreducible factors so that @xmath22 .",
    "the proof of mostow s theorem is the easiest to finish in eberlein s case ( where @xmath5 is reducible and @xmath3 is irreducible ) .",
    "the key ingredient is the borel density theorem ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "it implies that the image of @xmath3 is dense in the identity component of each @xmath23 .",
    "it follows that the map of maximal boundaries is actually induced by an isomorphism of lie groups @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 denotes the identity component of the isometry group ) . from this , the result follows ( cf corollary 18.2 , page 133 , in @xcite ) .",
    "( a historical remark : one of the earliest rigidity results was proved by selberg in 1957 .",
    "he considered the case where @xmath5 is the product of @xmath26 copies of the hyperbolic plane and where @xmath3 is irreducible .",
    "he used the fact that @xmath27 was dense in each copy of @xmath28 to show that any deformation of @xmath3 in @xmath19 had to be trivial .",
    "the details of this argument can be found in @xcite . )",
    "there are two steps in eberlein s generalization of mostow s argument ( to the case where @xmath4 is not required to be symmetric ) .",
    "first one shows that @xmath4 also splits isometrically as @xmath29 .",
    "( this is accomplished in @xcite . ) in the second step ( which was actually accomplished in the earlier papers @xcite and @xcite ) one shows that each factor @xmath30 is actually a simple lie group and that each @xmath31 is a symmetric space .",
    "hence , one is reduced back to mostow s theorem .",
    "the arguments in the second step are mainly lie group theoretic .",
    "the key ingredient is again a density property ( which is closely connected to the borel density theorem ) , namely , that @xmath2 satisfies the `` duality condition '' of @xcite .",
    "one shows that the the image of @xmath2 in @xmath32 is not discrete and hence , that the identity component @xmath33 of the closure of its image in @xmath32 is a nontrivial lie group .",
    "one then argues that each @xmath33 must be semisimple since otherwise @xmath2 ( and hence @xmath3 ) would contain a nontrivial normal abelian subgroup .",
    "our argument , in the case where @xmath4 is no longer assumed to be riemannian , follows the same general outline .",
    "we show , in section 2.1 , that eberlein s arguments can be modified to prove that @xmath4 splits isometrically , as before . as for the second step , we first must face the fact that we do nt know , _ a priori , _ that the isometry groups @xmath32 are lie groups .",
    "( the hilbert ",
    "smith conjecture is still open  if a topological group acts effectively on a topological manifold it is not known if this forces it to be a lie group . ) in fact , _ a priori , _ the spaces @xmath31 , which are manifold factors , need not be manifolds .",
    "we get around this by showing , in section 2.3 , that @xmath32 acts transitively on @xmath31 .",
    "( this comes from the fact that @xmath2 is dense in @xmath30 . )",
    "it then follows from a theorem of montgomery and zippin that @xmath32 is a lie group .",
    "then , following the line of argument in @xcite and @xcite one can conclude that each @xmath30 is a simple lie group . at this stage",
    "we are still not done . even though @xmath4 is now a homogeneous space of the form @xmath34",
    ", the possibility remains that its @xmath18invariant metric is not riemannian .",
    "however , we show in lemma 18 that the nonpositivity of the curvature excludes this possibility .    after writing a preliminary version of this paper we learned of b leeb s recent preprint @xcite .",
    "a corollary of his theorem is that the rigidity theorem also holds in the singular case whenever each factor of @xmath5 has rank @xmath35 .",
    "leeb s approach generalizes gromov s line of argument in @xcite .",
    "thus , the singular version of the rigidity theorem holds in complete generality . we should also mention that bruce kleiner can prove our result by a somewhat different argument .",
    "davis and zheng were partially supported by nsf grants , zheng was also partially supported by an alfred p sloan fellowship .",

    "a complete , simply connected riemannian manifold is a hadamard space if and only if its sectional curvature is @xmath43 .",
    "a key fact is that , for any hadamard space @xmath4 , the metric @xmath44 is a convex function , cf @xcite .",

    "it follows that any hadamard space is contractible .",
    "( there is an unique geodesic segment from a given base point to any other point ; one can then contract the space to the base point by shrinking the geodesic segments . )    a geodesic space has _ extendible geodesics _ if every geodesic segment can be extended to a larger interval .",

    "choose a small ball @xmath50 centered at @xmath49 with @xmath51 and small enough so that @xmath50 is convex .",

    "if the hadamard space @xmath4 is locally compact , then it can be compactified by adding an `` ideal boundary '' @xmath63 .",
    "one way to define this is as the set of all geodesic rays emanating from a given basepoint .",

    "in fact , it was precisely for the purpose of studying polyhedral metrics on convex polyhedral surfaces that aleksandrov initiated the study of length spaces with curvature bounded from below .",
    "the gauss equation remains valid for the hypersurfaces in manifolds equipped with an indefinite metric , the only change that is necessary is that one side of the equation must be multiplied by @xmath73 when the inner product is negative definite in the normal direction .",

    "( recently , moussong has extended this result to arbitrary spacelike convex hypersurfaces in @xmath74 . )    as a simple corollary we get the following example .",
    "[ @xcite ] every complete hyperbolic manifold @xmath87 admits a nonpositively curved , piecewise euclidean metric .",

    "denote by @xmath514 the projection of @xmath89 on @xmath365 , and write @xmath515 the identity component of its closure . by the proof of lemma 3.1 of @xcite , which essentially uses theorem 2.4 of @xcite ( cf lemma 17 )",
    ", we know that each @xmath33 is a centerless semisimple lie group of noncompact type . fix a maximal compact subgroup @xmath516 . by taking the circumcenter of an orbit , we know that @xmath71 will fix some point in @xmath365 .",
    "let @xmath517 be a fixed point of @xmath71 . since @xmath365 is locally compact , the isotropy subgroup of @xmath33 at @xmath215 is compact , and equals to @xmath71 since @xmath71 is maximal compact .",

    "without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath18 is simple .",
    "assume @xmath575 , we want to conclude that @xmath34 is the hyperbolic plane .",
    "let @xmath60 be the rank of @xmath34 .",
