    "our calculations of the ground state properties are based on density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) within local density approximation@xcite ( lda ) implemented in the pseudo - potential plane wave framework@xcite .",

    "the distance between two adjacent layers has been set to 15   to simulate an isolated graphane sheet .",
    "we chose a 90 ry kinetic energy cutoff for the electronic wave function expansion and a @xmath79 monkhorst - pack@xcite mesh for brillouin zone ( bz ) integration .",
    "then , the optimized unit cell has been obtained minimizing the total energy as a function of the lattice parameter . at each value of the lattice constant the atomic positions",
    "( @xmath80 the internal degree of freedom ) were fully relaxed to minimize the hellman - feynman@xcite forces . in the optimized structure",
    "the two ch units relax up - word and down - word respect to the ideal position of the graphene layer resulting in the formation of sp@xmath8 c - c and c - h bonds .",
    "in particular the bond length are 1.51    ( for the c - c bonds ) and 1.11    ( for the c - h bonds ) in agreement with previous calculations@xcite .",
    "phonon frequencies were calculated using the plane waves method within linear response theory@xcite using a @xmath81 monkhorst - pack @xmath82-point mesh to compute the dynamical matrix .",
    "this allows us to achieve a very good convergence on the phonon spectrum ( about 2% in the phonon frequency ) .",
    "a @xmath83 @xmath84-mesh in the bz was used to interpolate the force constants for the phonon dispersion calculation .    finally in calculating the qp energies we used the gw approximation of hedin@xcite , and",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) has been solved to cope with excitonic effects in the absorption spectra@xcite . in particular in our calculation of qp energies we used a @xmath81 @xmath82-point mesh and 100 bands for computing the self energy .",
    "we take into account dynamical screening effects in w through the generalized plasmon pole model .",
    "the same @xmath82-point mesh with 40 bands has been used to evaluate the dielectric function in rpa .",
    "the electron - hole kernel in the bse and the dielectric function has been evaluated on a @xmath81 k - point mesh .",
    "moreover we used 100 bands for the calculation of @xmath85 and 20 bands to evaluate @xmath16 since we were interested to the low energy region of the spectrum .",
    "in fig.[ph ] ( solid line ) we show the calculated phonon dispersion curve for a perfect graphane in the chair configuration .",
    "the phonon spectra presents three well separated types of vibrations : the low - frequency acoustic modes ( not shown ) , the intermediate - frequency optical modes involving the stretching of the c - c bonds , and separated by a gap of 1500 @xmath5 ( not shown ) , we find optical modes corresponding to c - h bonds .",
    "the presence of this large gap proves that the vibrations of h atoms are almost completely decoupled from the other modes .    .",
    "[ ph ]    comparison of our calculated spectra with available experimental raman data , shows that the measured @xmath3 peak agrees well with the calculated raman active e@xmath4 phonon at 1340 @xmath5 while the @xmath6 peak observed at 1500 @xmath5 most likely is related to impurity effects due to h vacancies .",
    "finally , in fig.[ph ] we compare the phonon spectra of ideal graphane ( solid line ) with that of @xmath86 hole - doped graphane ( dashed line ) obtained in the rigid - band approximation .",
    "as we can see hole - doping causes a strong renormalization of the phonon spectra near to the @xmath9 point .",
    "in particular the two degenerate optical modes related to the c - c stretching with h atoms moving in - phase with c atoms soften from 1168 @xmath5 to 542 @xmath5 while the two degenerate optical modes related to c - c stretching with h atoms moving out - of - phase with c atoms soften from 1333 @xmath5 to 1221 @xmath5 .",
    "the large kohn anomaly at 542 @xmath5 suggest a strong electron - phonon coupling in doped graphane related to the c - c covalent bonds .",
    "this makes doped graphane a possible candidate for high t@xmath7 superconductivity .",
    "in this section we perform an analysis of symmetry properties of the wave functions corresponding to the valence and conduction bands at the @xmath9 point based on the group theory .",
    "this allows to explain the behaviour of the absorption spectra at low energy for different polarizations and the nature of the two nearly degenerate excitons .",
    "graphane in the chair conformation belongs to the @xmath87 point group which is characterized by 12 symmetry operations ( with inversion ) and 6 irreducible representations : two 2d representations e@xmath4 and e@xmath14 and four 1d representations a@xmath10 ,",

    ".character table for d@xmath90 point group .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the valence bands are two fold degenerate at the @xmath9 point they belong to one of the 2d irreducible representation e@xmath4 or e@xmath14 .",
    "however as can be inferred from fig.[charge ] ( a ) and ( c ) , the wave functions corresponding to the valence bands are symmetric respect to the inversion .",
    "this is sufficient to conclude that the valence bands indicated with @xmath91 and with @xmath92 belong to the e@xmath4 irreducible representation .",
    "moreover we indicate with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the corresponding wave function , with the label 1(2 ) indicating that the wave function is antisymmetric ( symmetric ) under reflection respect to the @xmath93 plane .",
    "the conduction band is not degenerate and it is characterized by a wave function antisymmetric respect to the inversion ( see fig.[charge ] ( b ) ) . on the other hand this latter is antisymmetric under refection respect to the @xmath93 plane .",
    "thus the conduction band ( @xmath94 ) belongs to the a@xmath13 ( see table[tabd3d ] ) irreducible representation .",
    "now we focus on the symmetry properties of a general polar vector ( @xmath95 ) as for example the dipole moment .",
    "it can be easily shown that the third component @xmath96 transforms in agreement with the a@xmath13 irreducible representation , while the in - plane components ( @xmath97 ) transform in agreement with the e@xmath14 irreducible representation .",
    "in particular @xmath27 is the partner of @xmath17 .",
    "then , when the light is directed along the @xmath98 axis the possible states coupled with the valence bands by dipole moment are contained in the direct product @xmath99 .",
    "this means that transitions from the valence to the conduction bands are forbidden for light directed along the @xmath98 axis and both excitons @xmath22 and @xmath20 are not visible . on the other hand ,",
    "when the light is directed along @xmath100 or @xmath101 , the possible states coupled with the valence bands by dipole moment are contained in the direct product @xmath102 which is a 4d reducible representation of the symmetry group in the bases defined by the four wave functions : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "it is now possible , starting from this bases set , to generate a set of wave functions symmetrically adapted with the three irreducible representation appearing in the direct product @xmath107 .",
    "in particular we found that the only wave function which transform in agreement with the a@xmath13 irreducible representation is a linear combination of @xmath105 and @xmath104 .",
    "this means that the only possible transitions involving the wave function @xmath108 are : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is now clear why the most bounded exciton related to electron - hole pairs ( @xmath109 ) is optical active for light polarized along @xmath101 , while the highest energy exciton related to electron - hole pairs ( @xmath110 ) is visible for light polarized along @xmath100 .",
    "however , due to the small overlap between @xmath108 and @xmath111 wave functions the two excitons present a very small strength compared with that of the higher energy excitons . as a results",
    ", it does not reflect with evident features on the behaviour of @xmath16 .",
    "the prominent peak at 15.4 ev is completely depressed , while the absorption is strongly enhanced at 10.2  ev and 11.0  ev .",
    "the first peak at 10.2  ev is related to the correlated electron and hole states with large wave vectors from the e@xmath4 bands and out - of - plane bands with qp energies 0.9 ev @xmath112 2.1 ev .",
    "the `` binding energy '' is about 0.5  ev .",
    "the second resonant exciton at 11.0 ev has a lower binding energy ( 0.2 ev ) and is formed by electron - hole pairs from c - h valence states and out - of - plane states with qp energy close to 1.20 ev .",
    "the series of excitonic resonances between 8.30 ev and 8.90 ev are related to the electron - hole pairs corresponding to transitions from the small wave vector e@xmath24 states to the out - of - plane states with qp energies 0.13 ev@xmath112 2.02 ev .",
    "finally , the lowest resonant excitonic peak at 6.46  ev ( peak @xmath3 in the inset in fig.2 ) originates from the mixture of the transitions from the highest e@xmath24 valence band to the a@xmath13 conduction band and the first out - of - plane band . because of the free - electron character of the electronic states involved in all these electron - hole resonances the corresponding excitonic wave functions are completely delocalized in the out - of - plane regions ( see fig.[exciton - s ] ( b ) ) .",
    "in this section we derive the @xmath32 hamiltonian @xmath113 for the valence bands around the @xmath9 point ( @xmath114 being a second order tensor operator which depends from the components of the wave vector @xmath115 ) . to determine the number of the independent parameters in @xmath113 we use the method of the invariants@xcite , which consists to impose the condition :          to determine the correct form of the hamiltonian",
    ", we first note that the tensor operator @xmath114 can be decomposed into two irreducible tensor operators , one ( @xmath121 ) belonging to the a@xmath10 irreducible representation and one ( @xmath122 ) belonging to the e@xmath4 irreducible representation ( @xmath123 being the partner of @xmath124 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath113 can be decomposed on a complete set of linearly independent @xmath125 dimensional matrices that transform according to those irreducible representations which are contained in the direct product @xmath126 .",
    "starting from the four linearly independent matrices @xmath127 ( identity matrix ) , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( pauli matrices ) we can construct a set of linearly independent matrices @xmath131 symmetrically adapted with the irreducible representation @xmath132 .",
    "this can be done in terms of the standard group theory using the relation :      where @xmath134 runs on the four matrices ( @xmath80 the identity and the three pauli matrices ) and @xmath135 is the matrix which represents @xmath117 in the irreducible representation @xmath9 .",
    "eq.[eqg ] allows to obtain from @xmath134 a matrix symmetrically adapted with the first row of the representation @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding partners @xmath136 can be constructed from :      with @xmath138 . in this case",
    "we found that @xmath127 and @xmath129 transform in agreement with @xmath12 and @xmath139 respectively . while @xmath130 transforms in agreement with the first row of @xmath140 and @xmath128",
    "is its partner . to determine the matrices symmetrically adapted with @xmath140 we chose @xmath141 as basis for the construction of @xmath118 .    at this point , for each irreducible representation @xmath9 , we can construct the corresponding invariant ( @xmath142 ) as a product of symmetrically adapted matrices @xmath136 and irreducible tensor components @xmath143 : @xmath144 .",
    "in particular we obtain two invariants : @xmath145 and @xmath146 but we do not find any invariant transforming with the @xmath139 representation .",
    "this happens because at the second order the tensor operator @xmath114 does not contain any term belonging to the @xmath139 representation ( see table [ tabd3d ] ) . on the other hand , in the presence of a magnetic field along the @xmath98 axes ( @xmath147 )",
    ", one other term @xmath148 appears in the hamiltonian ( @xmath149 being the @xmath98 component of the angular momentum ) which results in a third tensor operator related to the commutator @xmath150 $ ] and belonging to the @xmath139 representation . as a consequence a third invariant @xmath151 $ ] appears in the hamiltonian .        with two independent parameters @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "diagonalizing eq.[eq1-s ] we find that the band dispersion in @xmath115 space is spherically symmetric with @xmath157 . on the other hand for the conduction band we found the trivial result : @xmath158 .",
    "moreover , from the calculation of @xmath155 ( @xmath159 ) , @xmath156 ( @xmath160 ) and @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) by interpolating the ab - initio band structure ( fig.1 ) we found the mean value of the effective mass of the two nearly degenerate excitons close to @xmath163 @xmath36 ( @xmath36 being the electron mass ) .",

    "<S> this can be used as an additional experimental fingerprint of the presence of hydrogenated platelets embedded in graphene .    considering the light propagating in the @xmath27-direction we find that the role of the strongly bound excitons is inverted : @xmath22 exciton becomes optical active , while @xmath20 exciton is dark . </S>",
    "<S> since the two excitons are nearly degenerate and have identical oscillator strengths for the corresponding polarization of light the absorption spectra remain almost unchanged . </S>",

    "<S> a group theoretical analysis@xcite shows that the only nontrivial dipole matrix elements are : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which explains why the @xmath22 and @xmath20 excitons are only visible for the @xmath27- and @xmath17-polarization , respectively . for the light propagating perpendicular to the graphene plane </S>",
    "<S> both excitons are dipole forbidden .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of h - vacancies with the strong spatial localization of the lowest @xmath22-exciton makes graphane to luminescence with high yield upon uv excitations , similarly to layered h - bn where a high luminescence yield is observed from a strong localized exciton@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a striking feature of the excitons @xmath22 and @xmath20 is their large binding energy , which at least by an order of magnitude exceeds that in typical wide gap semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes especially surprising if we note that both the a@xmath13 conduction band and the e@xmath4 valence bands are nearly perfect parabolas over a large fraction of bz , and , therefore , the excitons , despite their small radius , should be reasonably well described within the effective mass approximation . using the standard method of invariants @xcite we derived the @xmath32 hamiltonian at @xmath9 for the valence bands @xmath33,\\ ] ] and for the conduction band @xmath34@xcite , from which we find the value of the reduced electron - hole mass @xmath35 , which is very typical for most known semiconductors ( here @xmath36 is the bare electron mass , and for simplicity we model the two valence bands by a single parabola with an average mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> a resolution of the apparent paradox is an unusual form of the effective electron - hole interaction in graphane . in 3d </S>",
    "<S> dielectric media the effective interaction is obtained by the replacement @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the static dielectric constant . </S>",
    "<S> this simple recipe does not work in graphane that is a 2d dielectric , where the very notion of the dielectric constant makes no sense . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , an external electric field @xmath39 induces a polarization @xmath40 which is bound to the plane : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the internal polarizability of the 2d dielectric . using the above relation in the poisson equation for a point charge we get the following effective interaction potential ( its 2d fourier component )    @xmath43    which is very different from the trivial renormalization of charge in 3d systems . </S>",
    "<S> the only parameter entering eq.[veff ] is the polarizability @xmath42 of a single graphane layer , which we extract from our _ ab initio _ results . since our calculation </S>",
    "<S> are performed for a periodic stack of layers with sufficiently large inter - layer distance @xmath44 , the 2d polarizability is related to the actually calculated 3d polarizability as follows @xmath45 , where @xmath38 is the dielectric constant of our 3d multilayer system . </S>",
    "<S> we can also estimate the exciton binding energy @xmath46 by the variational solution of the schrdinger equation with the effective potential in eq.[veff ] using the simplest trial wave function , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the variational parameter@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result @xmath49  ev is very close to the ab - initio value of 1.6  ev , while the optimized value of the variational parameter @xmath50a.u . </S>",
    "<S> almost perfectly matches the actual excitonic radius . </S>",
    "<S> hence we clearly see that unusual strong binding of excitons in graphane is a result of a weak and specifically nonlocal 2d dielectric screening .    because of the small radius and the large binding energy of excitons it is tempting to consider graphane as a potential candidate for a realization of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of optically pumped excitons . indeed , using the standard expression for the degeneracy temperature @xmath51 of a 2d bose gas@xcite :    @xmath52    ( </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath53 is the excitonic mass ) we find that at room temperature @xmath54 the quantum degeneracy of excitonic gas in graphane is reached for the density @xmath55  @xmath56@xmath57 , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath58  @xmath59@xmath57 ( the later value sets an order of magnitude of the mott critical density for the transition from the gas of excitons to a gas / liquid of unbound electrons and holes ) . </S>",
    "<S> another argument in favor of excitonic bec in graphane is a spatial separation of the charges in the excitonic state  </S>",
    "<S> the hole is localized in the middle c - layer , while the electron on top of the h - layers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore graphane looks quite similar to the coupled quantum wells ( cqw ) structures , which are very popular for experiments on excitonic bec @xcite . in cqw </S>",
    "<S> @xcite such a separation leads to a very long excitonic life time that reaches microseconds . to estimate the radiative life time @xmath60 of the excitons in graphane we adopted a 2d version of the approach of ref.@xcite , which lead to the following relation    @xmath61    where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath22 are the exciton frequency , dipole matrix element , and the unit cell area , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the result we find , @xmath64 ps , is not very encouraging  the value is too small to unconditionally speak about bec . on the other hand , it is still larger that the lifetime of cavity polaritons where bec has probably been observed @xcite . clearly a detailed analysis of the thermalization kinetics is needed to make more definite predictions . </S>",
    "<S> defects will also play a role in pinning the exciton condensate . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we believe that bec of strongly bound , small radius excitons in graphane is an interesting possibility which deserves to be carefully studied both experimentally and theoretically .    this work was supported by the spanish mec ( fis2007 - 65702-c02 - 01 ) , aci - promociona ( aci2009 - 1036 ) grupos consolidados upv / ehu del gobierno vasco `` ( it-319 - 07 ) , the european union through e - i3 etsf project ( contract number 211956 ) . </S>",
