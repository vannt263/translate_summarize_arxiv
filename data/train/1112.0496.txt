    "there is , unfortunately , a very large uncertainty in the predicted fusion cross sections for @xmath1c+@xmath1c that are needed in a stellar environment @xcite , partly because the cross sections are difficult to measure down to the low energies that are of interest , and partly because the data contain strong resonance structures that make it difficult to extrapolate the measured cross sections to low energy . in order to get some constraints on the extrapolation",
    "it is instructive to analyze the existing fusion data for @xmath0c+@xmath0c by trentalange et al .",
    "@xcite and charvet et al .",
    "@xcite , and also of the @xmath1c+@xmath0c data by dayras et al .",
    "@xcite and notani et al .",
    "@xcite , because these data do not exhibit strong resonance features .",
    "the @xmath0c+@xmath0c fusion data @xcite are analyzed by coupled - channels calculations that include couplings to the one - phonon quadrupole and octupole excitations in projectile and target , as well as mutual excitations of these states .",
    "the effect of one - neutron transfer , which can proceed to the @xmath1c+@xmath2c mass partition with positive @xmath3 value is also studied , and so is the effect of the neutron exchange with zero q value in @xmath1c+@xmath0c reactions .",
    "the fusion cross sections are determined by ingoing - wave - boundary conditions ( iwbc ) that are imposed at the minimum of the pocket in the entrance channel potential .",
    "the calculated cross sections defined this way are fairly smooth as functions of the center - of - mass energy and they are well suited to analyze the fusion data for @xmath0c+@xmath0c @xcite and @xmath1c+@xmath0c @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1c+@xmath1c fusion data , on the other hand , contain a lot of structures or resonances , and it is beyond the scope of this investigation to try to reproduce these data in detail .",
    "it is , however , of great interest to see how the calculated cross sections , obtained from the iwbc , compare to the data and how they possibly can be used to put constraints on the extrapolation to very low energies .",
    "the coupled equations are solved using either a standard woods - saxon @xcite or the m3y+repulsion , double - folding potentials @xcite .",
    "the coupled - channels effects on the calculated fusion cross sections are relatively modest compared to the large enhancement of several orders of magnitude that are commonly seen in calculations of heavy - ion fusion reactions . for the carbon systems , the enhancement of fusion compared to the no - coupling limit is typically a factor of 2 at energies far below the coulomb barrier .",
    "however , it is a challenge to explain the data in detail because the coupled - channels calculations are sensitive to channels that have rather high excitation energies .",
    "one problem is that these channels are closed at low beam energies but that problem can be solved by imposing the correct , decaying state boundary conditions at large distances between the reacting nuclei @xcite .",
    "another problem is that the nuclear structure of high - lying states is sometimes very uncertain .",
    "the m3y+repulsion potential was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the hindrance that has been observed in the fusion of many heavy - ion systems at very low energies @xcite .",
    "the hindrance phenomenon was first observed as a suppression at very low energies of @xmath4ni+@xmath5y fusion data compared to calculations that were based on a standard woods - saxon potential @xcite .",
    "a simple explanation of the phenomenon is the existence of a shallow pocket in the entrance channel potential which forces the fusion cross section to vanish as the center - of - mass energy approaches the minimum energy of the pocket @xcite .",
    "important issues have been whether the fusion hindrance also occurs in light - ion systems , and how it will affect the extrapolation of measured cross section to the low energies that are of interest to astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the evidence for quasi - molecular resonances , observed in the elastic scattering @xcite and fusion reactions @xcite of @xmath1c+@xmath1c are usually explained as resonances in a shallow two - body potential between the reacting nuclei . we will show that the analysis of the @xmath0c+@xmath0c and @xmath1c+@xmath0c fusion data supports the idea of a fusion hindrance and the existence of a shallow pocket in the entrance channel potential .",
    "the fusion cross sections reported in refs .",
    "@xcite are based on measurements of the characteristic @xmath6-rays emitted from some of the evaporation residues that are produced , mostly those associated with the proton , neutron , and @xmath7 decay .",
    "the total fusion cross sections were obtained with the aid of statistical model calculations which is a major source of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the systematic error is difficult to estimate but it can be quite large .",
    "for example , the systematic error of the absolute cross sections quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath815% . since some of the systematic error concerns the overall normalization of the measured cross sections , and not so much the shape ( i.  e. , the energy dependence of the cross section ) , it is of interest to adopt an adjustable overall normalization when analysing the data .",
    "the ingredients of the coupled - channels calculations are presented in the next section .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath0c+@xmath0c fusion data is discussed in section iii , where the optimum parameters of the m3y+repulsion potential , such as the radius parameter of @xmath0c and the diffuseness associated with the repulsive term , are determined .",
    "these parameters are used together with a parameterization of the experimental density of @xmath1c as input to the coupled - channels calculations of the fusion cross sections for @xmath1c+@xmath0c and @xmath1c+@xmath1c which are presented in sections iv and v , respectively .",
    "the systematics of the low - energy fusion cross sections for the 3 systems of carbon isotopes is discussed in section vi .",
    "finally , the conclusions of this work are presented in section vii .",
    "the ingredients in the coupled - channels calculations include the ion - ion potential , the nuclear structure input , the strength and q - value of the transfer reactions , and the definition of the fusion cross section .",
    "the coupled - channels technique that is used has been applied previously and is described , for example , in refs .",
    "all of the details will therefore not be repeated here .",
    "it is emphasized that the calculations are performed in the rotating frame approximation @xcite which makes it feasible to include the most important reaction channels in the calculations . in this approximation ,",
    "the magnetic quantum number @xmath9 of the entrance channel is conserved . in reactions between nuclei with @xmath10 ground states",
    ", this implies that the @xmath9 quantum number remains zero . in reactions with odd nuclei",
    "one would have to repeat the calculations for each initial value of @xmath9 and the average fusion cross section should be compared to the measurements . in the fusion of @xmath1c+@xmath0c , for example ,",
    "the ground state of @xmath1c is a @xmath10 state and @xmath0c has a @xmath11 ground state .",
    "however , the cross sections for @xmath9 = -1/2 and + 1/2 are identical so it is sufficient to calculate the cross section once .",
    "besides the commonly used woods - saxon potential , the ion - ion potential that will be used in this paper is the so - called m3y+repulsion potential @xcite .",
    "it consists of the conventional m3y potential and a repulsive term which is discussed below .",
    "the m3y double - folding potential is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the m3y effective nucleon - nucleon interaction derived from the reid potential @xcite .",
    "the densities @xmath14 of the @xmath1c and @xmath0c carbon isotopes are parametrized in terms of the symmetrized fermi functions defined in the appendix of ref .",
    "one advantage of this parametrization is that the mean square radius is given by the simple expression , @xmath15 in terms of the radius @xmath16 and the diffuseness @xmath17 .",
    "the diffuseness of the densities for both nuclei is set equal to 0.44 fm so the only parameters that need to be specified are the matter radii of the reacting nuclei .",
    "this choice of the diffuseness is in good agreement with the tail of the measured point - proton density of @xmath1c @xcite which is illustrated in fig .",
    "the calculated point - proton distribution has the radius @xmath16 = 2.155 fm consistent with the measured rms charge radius .",
    "the radii that reproduce the point - proton ( pp ) rms radii of @xmath1c and @xmath0c , extracted from the measured root - mean - square ( rms ) charge radii @xcite , are shown in the last few lines of table i. the quoted radius for @xmath1c is expected to be a realistic estimate of the matter radius of @xmath1c and it will therefore be used in calculations of the m3y double - folding potentials .    the matter radius of @xmath0c is possibly larger than the radius of @xmath1c because of the valence neutron .",
    "that is what one would expect by adding a neutron to an inert @xmath1c core nucleus .",
    "a simple estimate based on a single - particle , woods - saxon potential gives a mean square radius of @xmath18 = 8.655 @xmath19 for the @xmath20 valence neutron .",
    "combined with the point - proton rms radius of @xmath1c , @xmath21 = 5.462(9 ) @xmath19 , one can now estimate the mean square matter radius @xmath22 of @xmath0c by @xmath23 the result is a rms matter radius of 2.378 fm .",
    "the associated radius of a fermi - function distribution with diffuseness @xmath17 = 0.44 fm is 2.228 fm according to the last line of table i. this is a useful reference value for the discussion below .    a critical part of the m3y+repulsion , double - folding potential is the repulsive part @xcite , which is generated by a contact interaction , @xmath24 .",
    "the densities that are used in calculating the repulsive , double - folding potential have the same radius as those that are used in the calculation of the m3y double - folding potential but the diffuseness @xmath25 is chosen differently ( usually smaller . ) the strength @xmath26 of the repulsion , on the other hand , is adjusted for a given value of @xmath25 so that the nuclear incompressibility @xmath27 = 234 mev is produced ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . ) with this constraint there are three parameters that must be specified before the m3y+repulsion potential can be calculated , namely , the matter radii of the two reacting nuclei , and the diffuseness parameter @xmath25 associated with the repulsion .    the parameters that give the best fit to trentalange s @xmath0c+@xmath0c fusion data are the @xmath0c radius @xmath16 = 2.28 fm and the diffuseness @xmath25 = 0.31 fm .",
    "how these parameters were determined is described in detail in section iii.b .",

    "the uncertainty in the strength of the octupole excitation , and also in the strength of transitions to high - lying states that are built on the @xmath51 and @xmath88 states , makes it difficult to predict the fusion cross sections very accurately when @xmath1c is involved .",

    "<S> fusion data for @xmath0c+@xmath0c , @xmath1c+@xmath0c and @xmath1c+@xmath1c are analyzed by coupled - channels calculations that are based on the m3y+repulsion , double - folding potential . </S>",
    "<S> the fusion is determined by ingoing - wave - boundary conditions ( iwbc ) that are imposed at the minimum of the pocket in the entrance channel potential . </S>",
    "<S> quadrupole and octupole transitions to low - lying states in projectile and target are included in the calculations , as well as mutual excitations of these states . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of one - neutron transfer is also considered but the effect is small in the measured energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that mutual excitations to high - lying states play a very important role in developing a comprehensive and consistent description of the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> thus the shapes of the calculated cross sections for @xmath1c+@xmath0c and @xmath0c+@xmath0c are in good agreement with the data . </S>",
    "<S> the fusion cross sections for @xmath1c+@xmath1c determined by the iwbc are generally larger than the measured cross sections but they are consistent with the maxima of some of the observed peak cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> they are therefore expected to provide an upper limit for the extrapolation into the low - energy regime of interest to astrophysics . </S>"
