    "binary stars are prime targets to study stellar evolution : for some spectral types more than 50% of stars are estimated to belong to binary or multiple - star systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and kepler s third law allows us to retrieve their global physical parameters , which is of crucial importance to constrain stellar evolution models .",
    "it is possible to determine the masses of each component @xmath1 for visual or eclipsing binaries , provided that spectral lines are detected for each star to track the doppler shifts along their orbits , and the product @xmath2 for spectroscopic - only binaries , where @xmath3 is the orbital plane inclination .",
    "moreover , close - in binary systems host unique and poorly - understood physical processes such as mass exchange between the two stars .",
    "the _ kepler _ satellite @xcite detected 2616 eclipsing binaries ( hereafter ebs ) by the end of january 2013 , which represented about 1.4% of the targets .",
    "these targets were listed by @xcite , then updated by @xcite and @xcite . within this list ,",
    "binary systems were classified into four types .",
    "( i ) detached ( d ) , where each component s radius is smaller than its roche lobe so stars are spherical .",
    "the stars have no major effect on each other , and essentially evolve separately .",
    "most binaries belong to this class .",
    "( ii ) semi - detached ( sd ) , where the biggest star fills its roche lobe leading to mass exchange .",
    "the mass transfer dominates the evolution of the system . in many cases , the inflowing gas forms an accretion disc around the accretor .",
    "( iii ) over - contact ( oc ) , where both stars fill their roche lobes and are in contact . the uppermost part of the stellar atmospheres forms a common envelope that surrounds both stars .",
    "( iv ) ellipsoidal variation ( elv ) , where no eclipse is observed but the system is detected in _ kepler _",
    "s light curves through the ellipsoidal shape of the stars .",
    "in addition to the _ kepler _ list , @xcite proposed a list of low - mass ( @xmath4 ) ebs , of which many in fact belong to the lists of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "red giants are evolved stars that have depleted the hydrogen in their cores and are no longer able to generate energy from core hydrogen burning .",
    "the physical processes taking place in their interiors are fairly poorly understood .",
    "however , the study of the global pulsations of red giants ( hereafter rgs ) with asteroseismology is capable of unambiguously determining bulk properties such as mass , radius , temperature , metallicity , and also the evolutionary state of rgs .",
    "indeed , the new era of space - based missions such as corot @xcite and _ kepler _ has dramatically increased the amount and quality of the available asteroseismic data . in particular , global oscillations of several thousands of solar - like stars and rgs",
    "have been detected in _",
    "kepler _ data , and analysis of the oscillation",
    "eigenmodes now allows robust seismic inferences to be drawn about their internal structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "applying modern asteroseismology to eb systems for which photometric and radial velocity data exist leads to the best possible physical characterizations : this is because masses and radii may be measured in two independent ways .",
    "such systems are cornerstones for testing stellar evolution models . until recently ,",
    "only one case of an oscillating rg belonging to an eb system had been reported ( kic 8410637 , * ? ? ?",
    "as only one eclipse of that system was observed , no estimate of orbital period or eccentricity could be obtained , but the global oscillations of the rg star were clearly detected . in addition , @xcite report the detection of a triple system containing a rg ( ) , and they explicitly mention that solar - like oscillations are not visible , even though most stars with similar parameters in the _ kepler _ database do clearly show such oscillations . in general , the _ kepler _ mission has succeeded in making breakthroughs in both the fields of binary stars and asteroseismology .",
    "for example , _ kepler _ helped reveal the presence of tidally - induced pulsations in the binary system koi 54 , which are the result of resonances between the dynamic tides at periastron and the free oscillation modes of one or both of the stars @xcite .    since most stars are observed at a 29-min cadence with _",
    "kepler _ , global modes of main - sequence solar - like stars are not accessible ; however , global modes of rg stars larger than @xmath5 are accessible ( e.g. , table 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "fortunately , an rg catalog from the _ kepler _ team has been compiled and made public for the scientific community . in this paper , we establish a list of rg candidates that likely belong to ebs or multiple - star systems , which we obtain from the eb and rg public catalogs .",
    "we test whether these candidates are part of eb or multiple systems and characterize their main physical properties .",
    "note we do not work with radial velocity measurements , for which data acquisition is in progress .",
    "we first present the results of a cross - correlation of the eb and rg catalogs ( section [ sec_2 ] ) , and the subsequent detailed analysis of their light curves to determine eclipse and asteroseismic properties ( section [ sec_3 ] ) .",
    "we identify 70 rgs possibly belonging to eb systems , of which 47 show clear global oscillation modes .",
    "mean properties of the global modes are used to infer rg masses and radii .",
    "we study several ways to determine whether the oscillating rgs actually do belong to the ebs with which they are associated , and then describe details of several important cases in section [ sec_4 ] . in section [ sec_5 ]",
    "we conclude by defining the observations that are needed to fully characterize this set of stars and discuss general implications for oscillating stars in binary systems .",
    "all data used in this paper are photometric measurements obtained by the nasa satellite _ kepler _ , launched in march 2009 to search for exoplanets in the habitable zone @xcite . since its launch , _ kepler _ has been monitoring about @xmath6 stars in a 105  deg@xmath7 field of view in between the cygnus and lyra constellations .",
    "data are subdivided in _",
    "quarters _ q , i.e. , three - month runs at the end of which the satellite is rotated by 90  deg to maintain the sun s position on its solar arrays and to keep the radiator pointed to deep space . the commissioning quarter q0 and quarter q1 lasted respectively 10 and 35 days , respectively . here ,",
    "we only utilize public data that are available through q13 as of january 2013 .",
    "light curve data released for the public on the mast database can be obtained in _ raw _ or _ corrected _ form .",
    "corrected fluxes have been processed by the presearch data conditioning ( pdc ) pipeline that removes signatures in the light curves that are correlated with systematic error sources from the telescope and spacecraft , such as pointing drift , focus changes , and thermal transients .",
    "the pdc attempts to correct for such errors while preserving planet transits and other astrophysically interesting signals .",
    "further details of the pipeline are described by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the _ kepler _ handbook .",
    "we use corrected pdc fluxes in this work .",
    "in addition , for each object there are _ target pixel files _ ,",
    "consisting of the flux for all the pixels contained within a predefined mask which are used to create the data found in the photometric light curve files .",
    "each target pixel file contains these pixels as a time series of images in a binary fits table .",
    "we use target pixel files in section [ sec_35 ] to determine whether the eclipsing signal we observe is from a nearby contaminating object .",
    "the _ kepler _ observations are sampled at either _ long cadence _ ( 29.4244 minutes ) or _ short cadence _ ( 58.89 seconds , for only 512 targets ) .",
    "most targets in this study were observed at long cadence ; for the few objects that were also observed at short cadence it was never for more than 30 days . therefore , we work primarily with long cadence data , and only consider the short - cadence data to search for high - frequency modes of the main - sequence or subgiant companion star belonging to the considered eb system . for long - cadence data ,",
    "the nyquist cut - off frequency is @xmath8hz , which limits the possibility of performing asteroseismology on any object whose frequency at maximum amplitude @xmath9 . by assuming an rg effective temperature of 4800  k and 1 @xmath10 , asteroseismic scaling laws @xcite",
    "predict that the lower limiting radius is approximately @xmath5 .",
    "the _ kepler _ team released a list of @xmath11 rgs on september 27 , 2011 , selected from the target list using color - magnitude estimates and considering effective temperatures @xmath12 k and surface gravities @xmath13 ( cgs ) .",
    "this latter criterion cuts off rgs with predicted oscillation peak frequency larger than about 320  @xmath14hz , slightly above the long - cadence nyquist frequency .",
    "we note that not all of the rgs were continuously observed , and they are typically the first targets to be dropped from the survey when pixel resources become scarce ( see the _ kepler _ red giant database ) .",
    "the rg _ kepler _ magnitudes range from 7.9 to 14.0 which makes them sufficiently bright for ground - based spectrometry to determine atmospheric parameters ( as the sdss iii apogee/_kepler _ experiment apokasc at apache point observatory is currently realizing ) .",
    "@xcite released a catalog of ebs identified in the _ kepler _ field from the first data releases ( q0q1 ) .",
    "the catalog was motivated by the exquisite quality of _ kepler _ data which has led to the discovery of hundreds of new systems , revolutionized accuracy in modeling eb systems , and provided an estimate of the frequency of occurrence of ebs .",
    "their method uses the transit planet search ( tps ) algorithm , first developed to detect exoplanets in the _ kepler _ data @xcite , by adapting it to search for eclipse durations consistent with ebs .",
    "the targets that present a positive detection are then down - selected to exclude objects already identified as exoplanets , variable or spotted stars that mimic eclipse shapes , blends from background stars , or pointing jitter artifacts .",
    "the eclipses are subsequently modeled with ebai ( eclipsing binaries via artificial intelligence ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which relies on trained neural networks using synthetic eclipse profiles to extract the physical parameters . for contact systems ,",
    "orbits are assumed to be circular and the main physical parameters fit are the temperature ratio @xmath15 , the mass ratio @xmath16 , the fillout factor @xmath17 which is a function of the potential gravity , and the inclination @xmath18 . for semi - detached and detached binaries , the mass ratio can not be estimated , and @xmath17 is replaced with the sum of fractional radii @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the semi - major axis of the binary orbit . the eccentricity @xmath21 together with the argument of the periastron @xmath22 are further introduced through @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a second catalog from @xcite updates the results by including data from q2 , adding some _ kepler _ objects of interest ( kois ) flagged as possible exoplanets and later determined to be ebs , adding objects with period longer than 44 days ( i.e. , q0@xmath25q1 ) , rejecting variables stars initially considered to be ebs , and removing ebs that were initially blends situated at the edge of the photometric aperture later re - observed with a re - centered aperture .",
    "this updated catalog presents 2165 ebs , composed of 58% detached ( d ) , 7% semi - detached ( sd ) , 22% overcontact ( oc ) , 6% ellipsoidal ( elv ) , and 7% undetermined systems . these studies conclude that eclipsing binaries represent 1.4% of the _ kepler _ target list .",
    "a third update has been published that employs an automatic morphological classification scheme @xcite , and additional eb candidates have been released on the _ kepler _ mast eb database , leading to a total of 2616 ebs .",
    "the _ kepler _ database contains @xmath11 stars identified as rgs , while the eclipsing binary catalog contains 2616 targets , as of january 2013 .",
    "the cross - correlation of both catalogs reveals that 70 stars are flagged as both eb and rg ( hereafter rg / eb ) : 56 systems ( 66% ) are classified as d , seven ( 10% ) as sd , 11 ( 16% ) as oc , and two ( 4% ) as elv ; two ( 3% ) are unclassified .",
    "such proportions are close to those of the whole sample , which is initially surprising since we do not expect rgs to belong to close - in systems , in particular sd and oc , where orbital periods range from 0.2 to 6 days ( see table [ table_1 ] ) . for our purpose of considering stars flagged as eb and rg ,",
    "it is prudent to keep in mind the recommendations of @xcite :    1 .",
    "`` the high star density leads to a non - negligible likelihood of associating an eb event with the wrong star ; '' 2 .",
    "`` the eb interpretation should be taken with extreme caution for stars with high fraction of flux contamination ; ''",
    "`` stars with shallow eclipse events should also be regarded with caution even if the flux contamination is modest . ''    hereafter , when we mention rg / ebs , we imply _ candidate _",
    "rg / eb systems . to understand the specificities of rg / ebs with respect to the whole eb catalog and how likely they may correspond with misidentifications , we compare histograms of observing conditions and stellar atmospheric parameters ( estimated when systems were supposedly single stars ) from the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic , @xcite ) , and orbital parameters published by @xcite in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "it appears that rg / ebs are slightly brighter on average than the full eb catalog , but this is not significant since rgs were selected with a magnitude limit of 14 . for stellar",
    "crowding , we only show contamination factors calculated on the apertures corresponding to the second of the four positions of the satellite ( i.e. , during q1 , q5 , and q9 ) .",
    "we also tested the three other satellite orientations without noting any relevant difference .",
    "we see that the contamination factor of rg / ebs is lower than the mean contamination of all ebs , which shows that our candidates are not overly predisposed to the risk of target misidentification or blending .",
    "histograms of rg / eb effective temperature and surface gravity are not representative of the whole eb catalog , but are instead typical of rgs .",
    "this means that even if a rg does not belong to an associated eb , there is still one rg per photometric aperture , whose flux overwhelms that from any secondary star .",
    "we note two exceptions at temperatures around 6500 k ( see table  [ table_1 ] ) that are classified as oc and are likely misidentified as rgs .",
    "the orbital period histograms of the rg / ebs and the total eb sample in figure [ fig2 ] are similar , and shows that most rg / eb systems have orbital periods @xmath26 days .",
    "the sum of relative radii are also similar in both samples with the exception of the lack of values lower than 0.1 in rg / ebs .",
    "the relative deficit of stars with a temperature ratio equal to one among rg / ebs can be related to the minor proportion of contact systems in the rg / eb sample .",
    "we note that the inclination and orbital eccentricity distributions seem to be locked in the ranges @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] , which suggests that the estimate of these parameters by @xcite could be biased .",
    "measuring orbital eccentricity from photometric data alone , i.e. , without radial velocities , is known to be inaccurate .    to get an initial rough estimate whether a rg is compatible with an eb , we determine the amplitude of the deepest eclipse measured in the rg / eb light curve .",
    "we assume the system is observed from the orbital plane , and that the rg is larger than its companion .",
    "we therefore adopt the convention that the deepest eclipse is the secondary eclipse ( i.e. , companion star going behind the rg ) if the companion s temperature is higher than the rg s , and that the deepest eclipse is the primary eclipse otherwise ( i.e. , when the rg s temperature is higher than that of the companion star ) . primary and secondary eclipses will have equal depths when the two stars effective temperatures are equal . a raw proxy of relative photometric dimming during primary and secondary",
    "eclipses can be obtained by neglecting stellar limb darkening and comparing simple luminosities : @xmath29 where the subscripts @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for the rg and the companion star , respectively .",
    "note the numerator of the second equation is @xmath32 since since the light dimming is due to the star of radius @xmath33 which hides a surface @xmath34 of the star of temperature @xmath35 . in figure [ fig3 ] we present the expected eclipse depth assuming a typical rg with radius @xmath36 and effective temperature @xmath37  k. we conclude that the range of photometric dimmings @xmath38 , which we measure in all but nine of the rg / ebs , is compatible with a stellar pair that includes a rg and a main - sequence star ( see table [ table_1 ] ) .",
    "we note that primary eclipse depths will be lower than the theoretical proxy in equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) when eclipses are grazing due to limb darkening .",
    "for the nine systems with very shallow eclipses , their depths range from 0.02% to 0.14% .",
    "these cases could either correspond to rgs with a background eb , eb systems with grazing eclipses , or eb systems where the companion star s size is a few percent of the rg s size , as could be possible for brown dwarfs or giant planets .    from the rg and eb catalogs , as well as from the associated kic parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,",
    "it is assumed that each candidate system contains one eb and one rg in the photometric aperture .",
    "however , suspicion of blending arises from quick calculations regarding the orbital period distribution .",
    "let us consider a simple configuration where a rg with radius and mass ( @xmath41 is in a phase - locked binary system with a solar - like companion ( @xmath42 ) in a circular orbit .",
    "( such parameters for the rg are close to the median values of rg / ebs obtained with asteroseismology in section [ sec_33 ] . ) in figure [ fig4 ] , we show the expected orbital velocities that the rg would have in that configuration , by varying both orbital period @xmath43 and semi - major axis @xmath20 : @xmath44 by using the values for the sum of fractional radii and orbital periods estimated for 46 out of the 70 systems by @xcite , we see that 14 rgs ( mostly of the oc class ) would have an orbital velocity between 500 and 2600  kms@xmath45 .",
    "even if our assumptions about the companion star s mass and radius are incorrect , this indicates that some systems are not physically possible as they would require an orbital velocity greater than the critical velocity that would begin to tear apart the rg .",
    "we consider a velocity to be `` critical '' when the rotation velocity at the equator equals the escape velocity . in the case of a phase - locked system ,",
    "the rotation period is simply the orbital period .",
    "any additional proper stellar rotation in the direction of the orbital motion ( e.g. ,  earth ) would lower the critical velocity , while a stellar rotation in the opposite direction of the orbital motion ( e.g. ,  venus , which is unlikely ) would enhance the critical velocity .",
    "based on this criterion , only 25 out of the 46 systems , for which we have orbital parameters , have a period compatible with the critical velocity threshold .",
    "this is the first of several clues that points to the fact that many of the candidates are not true rg / eb systems .    in the following sections , we use several analysis techniques to better characterize the systems and",
    "more accurately determine how many of our candidate systems are bona - fide rg / ebs .",
    "the cross correlation between the rg and eb databases resulted in 70 identifications . we consider four possible scenarios :    1 .",
    "the rg is actually one of the eb stars .",
    "the rg is aligned within the pixel field of view with the eb and is a part of a multiple system ( gravitationally speaking ) , of which two close - in stars mutually eclipse , with the rg out of the eb s orbital plane .",
    "eclipse timing variations ( etvs ) may be observed in this case ( see section [ sec_41 ] ) .",
    "the rg is aligned within the pixel field of view with the eb , but is not gravitationally bound .",
    "4 .   the rg and the eb fall on different pixels in the aperture and are not gravitationally bound .",
    "the last case can be verified using the target pixel files associated with each star by computing a map of the relative intensity variation @xmath46 to check whether the depth of the eclipse is correlated to the peak intensity source on the detector .",
    "every quarter when the spacecraft rotates , a star falls onto a different set of pixels , and the pixel mask ( aperture ) that defines the optimal output light curve often changes . in the case of a long - period eb ,",
    "the eclipses only occur in a few of the quarters .",
    "we detrended each pixel light curve in a quarter by a low - order polynomial and then modulated ( `` folded '' ) it by the period estimated from the global light curve .",
    "the relative intensity drop @xmath46 was then calculated and an image of this eclipse depth was compared to an average intensity image for the quarter .    in 40 of the 47 cases ,",
    "we find that the peak in intensity corresponds to the peak in eclipse depth , indicating scenarios 1 or 3 above can not be ruled out ( and for the nine brightest stars , saturation in the aperture that buries any eclipse signature on individual pixels does not allow this method to be used ) .",
    "we find 7 clear cases where the pixel with the deepest eclipse occurs away from the pixel with the peak mean intensity ( and typically outside of the _ kepler _ aperture as well ) .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_jean ] for kic 4576968 , which is classified in the binary catalog as an oc system .",
    "the overall peak in intensity of the mean photometry is well inside the defined aperture , yet the maximal eclipse depth is about two pixels outside of this region .",
    "the eclipse depth considering only pixels within the aperture is about 0.06% , while outlying pixels reach about 2% .",
    "studying the individual folded light curves for each pixel confirms that the eb and the rg are on different pixels , and likely not part of the same system .",
    "all of these 7 cases occur in short , approximately less than 1 day period ebs , where it is indeed physically impossible for the rg to be one of the eclipsing stars and still remain intact .",
    "five such systems ( kic 2711123 , 4576968 , 5652071 , 7879404 , 11968514 ) show behavior where we are confident that the rg is a background contaminant and not actually a part of the eb , as scenario 4 describes .",
    "two other cases ( kic 7031714 , 7955301 ) show etvs and are consistent with scenario 2 , but are likely to be false positives . indeed , if these objects were gravitationally bound and separated by one or more four - arcsecond pixels , the physical separation at the distance of a magnitude-9 giant star would be on the order of several hundred to thousands of au , which implies an orbital period of several thousands of years .",
    "hence these cases could correspond to a rg with a background triple system .",
    "in addition , for each star , we compute the power spectrum of each pixel .",
    "it appears that the global oscillations always originate from the pixels where intensity is maximum , which means that the brightest star systematically corresponds to a red giant , for the systems where oscillations are detected .",
    "we even distinguish by eye the rg oscillations on the map of folded light curves across the photometric aperture through a point dispersion larger than the average noise ( see figure [ fig_jean ] , panel ( d ) ) .",
    "two distinct ways of processing the light curves are required for modeling eclipses or analyzing seismic properties .",
    "eclipse modeling consists of extracting the stellar parameters from fitting the shape of the light curve during eclipses after removing instrumental biases and , ideally , other sources of stellar variability ( e.g. , activity , pulsations ) . on the contrary ,",
    "studying global mode properties requires that the time series from which we calculate power spectra is free from periodic signals such as instrumental systematics and stellar eclipses . in other words :",
    "global modes are noise for eclipse modeling and vice versa .",
    "nevertheless , there are initial reduction procedures common to both cases .",
    "for example , it is absolutely necessary to remove long time drifts and discontinuities , which are mostly of instrumental origin , particularly after _ kepler _ rotates between consecutive quarters .",
    "note that we do not use the portion of each light curve between eclipses for our light curve models due to difficulties in disentangling instrumental flux variations , stellar activity ( spots , granulation ) , reflection , doppler beaming , and ellipsoidal variations .",
    "we assume that the median fluxes of each quarter s data are equal , and normalize them to 1 to work with relative fluxes .",
    "the entire light curve is then concatenated , and all outliers ( selected as being out of the light curve mean dispersion by an amount evaluated individually for each target ) are eliminated .",
    "the next step depends on the specifics of each light curve .",
    "five classes of datasets and procedures are described :    * short orbital period ebs ( e.g. , figure [ fig_clean_1 ] ) .",
    "when the time series is long enough to contain more than about 30 orbits , we proceed by assuming that the signal fluctuations , be they stellar or instrumental in origin , may be averaged out by folding and rebinning the light curve .",
    "we proceed by subtracting the mean folded light curve from the original .",
    "this results in a time series with no eclipse ( see the black curve in figure [ fig_clean_1 ] , top panel ) which retains the stellar variability that we use to search for global modes in the fourier domain .",
    "next , we smooth this time series with a moving average whose width is set on the characteristic time scale of the photometric variations to be cancelled .",
    "the smoothed time series is then subtracted from the original time series to get a light curve with a flat level between eclipses . in principle , this is the best method because it is simple and makes no assumption about the origin of any photometric fluctuations . in practice , we limited the use of this method to systems with orbital period shorter than 20 days .",
    "* ebs with stellar variations on the order of the orbital period , which is much longer than the eclipse duration ( e.g. , figure [ fig_clean_2 ] ) . in this case , a stellar signal of amplitude similar to or higher than the eclipse s depth can not be cancelled out by folding the data .",
    "we proceed by identifying the centers of the primary and secondary eclipses , bridging them with a second - order polynomial , and then subtracting the smoothed light curve from the original to yield a flattened light curve with equally deep eclipses .",
    "we use a second - order polynomial to `` fill '' each eclipse by simply fitting the short regions of the light curve on either side of the eclipse of duration equal to the eclipses .",
    "we find a second order polynomial is sufficient account for the local behavior of the light curve .",
    "next , an asteroseismic analysis is carried out on the light curve that has the eclipses filled with polynomials to avoid periodic gaps .",
    "this technique can not be applied if the eclipse duration is too large compared to the orbital period because we would cancel the signal by filling the eclipses . *",
    "long orbital period ebs .",
    "when the eclipse duration is less than @xmath47 of the duration of the entire light curve , we postulate that simply removing the data where eclipses occur does not significantly change the duty cycle for the asteroseismic analysis . for eclipse modeling in such systems , we flatten the light curve after `` filling '' eclipses with second - order polynomials , as in the previous case . *",
    "ebs with variable eclipse depth and timing ( e.g. , figure [ fig_clean_3 ] ) . in several cases ,",
    "we encounter light curves with eclipses whose depth and timing change with time , either of astrophysical or instrumental origin ( e.g. , varying flux contamination at each field rotation ) .",
    "we do not attempt to model such eclipses in this work because it often implies accounting for a third body when there is an astrophysical cause , or it requires careful modeling of systematic errors when the cause is instrumental .",
    "for asteroseismology , however , we fit individual eclipses with simple functions and then subtract them from the time series .",
    "the functions we use to fit eclipses are gaussian when eclipses are grazing ( no flat bottom , or `` v - shaped '' ) , or the @xcite exoplanetary fitting function otherwise . * contact ebs with variable amplitude ( e.g. , figure [ fig_clean_4 ] ) .",
    "as indicated in the previous cases , varying flux contamination can modify the apparent amplitude of eclipses , and the technique of fitting eclipses with gaussian or exoplanetary functions is not possible for contact ( oc ) systems .",
    "therefore , after subtracting a smooth version of the light curve , we measure positions and amplitudes of all local maxima and minima per half - orbit and smooth them .",
    "then we normalize the time series with the smoothed amplitude of the light curve and subsequently measure asteroseismic parameters .",
    "no light - curve modeling is attempted for these systems .",
    "we search for global oscillation modes in light curves where eclipses have been handled as described in section [ sec_31 ] . in this paper , we only consider clear oscillatory excess power , and do not consider low signal - to - noise ratio excess power that in principle could be detected with filtered autocorrelation techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , since the light curves studied here could have remnants of eclipse features , the presence of harmonics of the orbital period would strongly perturb the computation of the autocorrelation function , leading to false mode detections .",
    "power density spectra ( pds ) are computed with the discrete fourier transform with no oversampling up to the nyquist frequency ( 283  @xmath14hz ) .",
    "we detect global modes in 47 of the 70 rg / eb candidates .",
    "the breakdown by binary classification is 37  d , two sd , five oc , and two elv .",
    "all power spectra showing solar - like oscillations are presented in figure [ fig_pds ] .",
    "one of the asteroseismic aims of this paper is the measurement of rg global mode parameters , such as their frequency at maximum amplitude @xmath48 and mean large frequency separation @xmath49 .",
    "the pair ( @xmath50 ) allows us to estimate the rg s mass and radius through well - known asteroseismic relations @xcite .",
    "the frequency at maximum amplitude @xmath51 is obtained by fitting the pds with a gaussian function for the mode envelope and a sum of semi - lorentzian functions to model the stellar activity .",

    "we make this assumption here because our modeled subsample includes only well - detached binary systems .",
    "the derived parameters for a subset of 18 binary systems are presented in table [ table_1 ] .",
    "we have analyzed the 18 most promising detached systems where a rg likely belongs to the eb ( see section [ sec_41 ] ) .",
    "thirteen of them present rg oscillations , and the other five are the longest - period systems where no detectable pulsations are observed .",

    "a further possibility is the presence of rgs in triple ( multiple ) systems in which two `` small '' stars mutually eclipse a primary component @xcite . within the triple - system hypothesis ,",
    "if the rg s orbit is elliptical and the distance of the rg to the pair of eclipsing stars is short enough to let tidal forces contribute to the evolution of the eclipsing system , we might detect eclipse timing variations ( etvs ) .",
    "this further requires that the rg orbital period is , at maximum , the same order of magnitude as the observation length .",
    "in addition , we may expect some variations in the eclipse depth and width if the precession of the eb system is rapid and strong enough to perturb the inclination angle of the eb orbital plane .",
    "the detection of etvs is a way to claim a system is at least triple , but the absence of a etv detection can not be considered proof that a system is not multiple since variations may be undetectable or on time scales much larger than the observation length .",
    "in addition , if the rg orbit is almost circular , no etvs are expected .",
    "the presence of etvs in this particular sample suggests that the rg is the third body that perturbs the eclipse timing , but this can only be proven with mass determinations from detailed etv models and/or the addition of radial velocities to the light curve analysis .",
    "we note that low - mass triple systems are common , particularly for systems with a close - in binary ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so a chance alignment of a triple system with a background rg is also possible .",
    "modeling etvs is a common approach to derive masses and orbital parameters for exoplanetary systems with at least two planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "modeling etvs of multiple stellar systems is beyond the scope of this paper ; rather , we first determine whether etvs are detectable and subsequently measure their amplitudes and periods .",
    "we use one of two methods to measure eclipse timings depending on the type of binary system . for d and sd systems",
    ", we fit the primary and secondary eclipses with the @xcite function used for fitting exoplanetary transits in the small - planet approximation , which acceptably reproduces the behavior of stellar eclipses",
    ". however , exoplanetary transit functions are not suitable for oc systems .",
    "therefore , for the oc binaries , we measure the minimum intensity time by interpolating around the minimum of both eclipses with spline interpolation .",
    "such an approach would not work for d systems with long orbital periods because the eclipse shape is usually strongly modulated by stellar spots , but it is suitable for sd systems .",
    "once etvs are detected , despite their typically asymmetric profiles , we estimate their periods by fitting a simple sine curve via the least - square method .",
    "eleven systems exhibit etvs at various signal - to - noise ratio levels , as shown in figure [ fig_etv ] .",
    "kic 7990843 , 7031714 , 4732015 , 10991989 , and 7955301 show etvs that are unambiguously coherent between primary and secondary eclipses , and for which periods are shorter than or near to the total observation length .",
    "@xcite note that kic 7955301 ( shown in figure [ fig_clean_3 ] ) presents eclipse depth variations , but based only on q1q2 data they could not determine whether these effects were real or due to aperture jitter from quarter to quarter . with a longer light curve now available , we see this system presents the highest etv amplitude of about four hours .",
    "precession effects are detectable in this system through the shift between primary and secondary eclipse timings and the long time - scale evolution of the eclipse depths .",
    "we also note the unexpected etvs detected for contact systems 11135978 and 9181877 , which show variations on time scales longer than the observation length ( 1400 and 5500 days , respectively ) and with a mean amplitude of only about 0.83 minutes .",
    "this is much lower than the 29-minute observing cadence and is about half of the etv standard deviation about the fitted sine curve of 1.68 minutes .",
    "we have shown that contamination in the _ kepler _ target pixel files confirmed seven systems as false positive rg / ebs . to uncover more false positives , we can rearrange kepler s third law to express the stellar mass ratio @xmath65 as a function of the orbital period @xmath43 , the semi - major axis @xmath20 , and the mass of the primary star @xmath66 : @xmath67 note that our convention defines star 1 to be the rg .",
    "we use rg masses and radii from the asteroseismic analysis ( see section [ sec_33 ] ) with a range of radii for the secondary star , @xmath68 , and also consider the relative stellar radii @xmath69 and @xmath43 from eclipse fitting and @xcite . with all of this information taken together , we estimate the @xmath70 required to satisfy kepler s third law for the pulsating sample .",

    "cases in which the rg would need to be part of a binary with a companion star @xmath74 times more massive are considered unrealistic . in this analysis , several systems",
    "take on a value of @xmath75 , which is of course unphysical : this is likely the result of inaccurate estimations of the relative stellar radii .",
    "the likely 13th candidate ( kic 5640750 ) system is not yet conclusive as its orbital period is longer than the observation time .",
    "the likely 14th candidate ( kic 8095275 ) does not allow us to estimate @xmath70 since it is a `` heartbeat system '' for which its orbital parameters are unknown and would require specific light curve modeling and radial velocities to determine ( see section [ sec_433 ] and @xcite ) .",
    "however , as such `` heartbeat '' light curve features are unique , we are confident that it is a _ bona - fide _ rg / eb system .    in summary ,",
    "the analysis here and in section [ sec_35 ] provides strong evidence that only 13 of the 47 pulsating systems are true rg / ebs in detached configurations , and one is a rg in a non - eclipsing binary system .",
    "all of these have orbital periods greater than 19  days .",
    "all of the shorter - period oc and sd systems are either contaminated or the rg is part of a multiple - star system",
    ". the rest of the d cases must be where the eb and the rg fall in the same line - of - sight but may be weakly gravitationally bound .",
    "finally , we note that testing the likeliness of rg / eb candidates is not possible when no rg pulsations are detectable .",
    "however , true rg / ebs may belong to this sample .",
    "in particular , the five non - pulsating rgs with the longest orbital periods ( shown in figure [ fig_lcmodbis ] ) are almost certainly true rg / ebs , as they have light curves very similar in appearance to the 13 pulsating _ bona - fide _ rg / ebs .",

    "kic 4732015 and 10991989 : : :    these d systems both present clear etvs with periods on the order of    the observation duration ( 1050 and 544 days , respectively ) with a    rather small amplitude ( 6.9 and 3.9 min ) .",
    "both systems are probably    hierarchical triple systems that have a more distant rg orbiting a    pair of close main - sequence stars ( 0.93 and 0.97 day periods ,    respectively )",
    ". however , these systems are significantly different    physically .",
    "kic 4732015 is an rgb star and is the biggest rg in our    sample    @xmath155 , while    kic  10991989 is a quiet , massive rc2 star with    @xmath156 .",
    "kic 5640750 : : :    this system is the only one whose orbital period is longer than the    total observation time ( q0q13 ; @xmath157  days ) .",
    "it    appears that the eclipse shape is similar to those of rgs orbiting f    type companions .",
    "modeling the light curve yields a degeneracy between    the orbital period and the eccentricity because we see only one    primary and one secondary eclipse so far .",
    "for our purpose , however ,    the temperature and radius ratios may still be estimated even if the    mass and semi - major axis are not yet . to model the light curve",
    ", we    assumed the orbital period to be twice the time between the primary    and secondary eclipses and set the argument of the periastron to    @xmath158 , because such an assumption leads to the    lower boundary of the eccentricity . from asteroseismic measurements ,    the rg has radius and mass of    @xmath159 .",
    "coupling this result with the preliminary eclipse modeling indicates    that the companion seems to be an f star with radius    @xmath160 and temperature    @xmath161  k , on an elliptical orbit with    @xmath162 .",
    "the high value of the rgs asteroseismic mass    ( @xmath163 ) suggests its period and semi - major    axis are largely underestimated , which also suggests a higher    eccentricity .",
    "kic 3532985 and 6762188 : : :    these d systems both present etvs with short periods ( 29 and 35 days ,    respectively ) of small amplitude ( 3.2 and 6.5 min , respectively ) , with    asymmetrical shapes . at first glance ,",
    "the etvs look like artifacts ,    but several methods to determine the eclipse timing were used and all    yielded etvs in these systems but not in the other targets .",
    "the rgs    associated with these systems are red clump stars : kic 3532985 is a    rc2 with    @xmath164 , while    kic 6762188 is a solar - mass rc1 with    @xmath165 .",
    "kic 8255058 : : :    this d system presents the most puzzling etv features from our sample .",
    "it appears similar to kics 3532985 and 6762188 , but its etvs actually    split into two components .",
    "we observe a rapid oscillation of period    equal to the eb orbital period , with 5-minute amplitude , as well as a    long period ( 868 days ) of similar amplitude ( 6.7 min ) .",
    "the rg is an    rgb star and is one of the smallest rgs in our sample with    @xmath166 .",
    "kic 7690843 and 7031714 : : :    these sd systems both present clear etvs with 75 and    @xmath167 day periods , respectively .",
    "the amplitude of the    etvs are weak and on the order of a few minutes , i.e. , shorter than    kepler s long - cadence sampling . however , kic 7031714 presents evidence    for stellar crowding and blending .",
    "kic 11135978 and 9181877 : : :    these oc systems display very slowly - varying etv trends    ( @xmath168 day ) with low signal - to - noise ratios in    amplitude .",
    "one would not expect that a third body could significantly    perturb the orbital equilibrium of the two contact stars .",
    "kic 7377422 , 4569590 , 3955867 , 9291629 , & 7943602 : : :    these detached systems present orbital periods , eclipse depths , and    eclipse shapes similar to the eight strongest rg / eb candidates where    we detect rg pulsations ( see figures [ fig_lcmod ] and [ fig_lcmodbis ] ) .",
    "oddly , the light curves of these four systems do not show pulsations .    their peculiarity , with respect to the pulsating rg / ebs candidates ,    consists of high quasi - periodic photometric variability ( between 10    and 30% ) .",
    "this suggests that either their modes are buried in the    noise of photometric variations , or that their mode frequencies are    above the nyquist frequency .",
    "alternatively , the fact that no    solar - like oscillations are detected in these objects that display    significant stellar variability agrees with @xcite , which suggests    that stellar activity inhibits the amplitude of solar - like    oscillations .",
    "this scenario does assume that the stellar variability    originates from the rg and not the companion , which is unknown .",
    "we have identified a set of potentially useful targets to test theories of stellar evolution .",
    "we are confident that 13 ( of 70 ) systems cross - listed from the rg and eb _ kepler _ catalogs are bona - fide pulsating red giants in eclipsing binaries .",
    "one is a red giant in a non - eclipsing binary system , and an additional five are likely red giants in eclipsing binaries even though we do not detect their pulsations .",
    "it is likely that at least 11 other systems are candidates for belonging to three - body configurations composed of a pair of eclipsing main - sequence stars and a red giant .",
    "oddly , we detect no oscillations in 23 of the red giant stars in candidate rg / eb systems across all classes of binaries .",
    "we identify several reasons that may explain this .",
    "first , the star could be misidentified and is not a giant .",
    "second , the treatment used for removing the eclipse signature may suppress any oscillations at very low frequency .",
    "also , the giants could actually be subgiants or low - luminosity red giants pulsating at frequencies beyond the nyquist frequency .",
    "finally , some phenomena in the interactions of a multiple system may yield a large damping effect of the global oscillations in the rg @xcite .",
    "therefore , in total , we believe many of the rg / eb candidates deserve to be followed - up with short - cadence _ kepler _ observations .",
    "this would allow global modes to be detected in a red giant for which @xmath48 is larger than the long - cadence nyquist frequency .",
    "ideally , this would allow for pulsations of the main - sequence companions to be measured as well ; however , the contribution to the total light from the companion star is only several percent in the best cases , making such detections very challenging in practice .",
    "spectroscopic measurements from the ground will certainly help in understanding these systems too .",
    "first , the identification of overlapping spectra could indicate whether the system is indeed composed of a rg and a main - sequence star .",
    "second , the measurement of radial velocities is a way of extracting accurate masses for the system that can be cross - checked with the asteroseismic inferences .",
    "third , it is a way to refine the estimate of the stellar parameters which are currently based on color photometry .",
    "we have already started observations of a subset of these 70 stars with the arces chelle spectrometer ( resolution @xmath169 ) at the apache point observatory ( apo ) , new mexico .",
    "other targets from our sample are currently being observed by the apogee spectrometer on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) telescope at apo , in the context of the apokasc program to support _ kepler _ observations in asteroseismology .",
    "this effort is coordinated by teams from the apogee project and the kepler asteroseismic science consortium ( kasc ) .",
    "in addition , the kasc working group 8 is studying in detail the systems kic 8410637 , 5640750 , and 9540226 . if more precise estimates of the stellar parameters can be obtained and coupled with eclipse information and asteroseismology , these rg / eb systems have the potential to become some of the most accurately studied stars .",

    "<S> red - giant stars are proving to be an incredible source of information for testing models of stellar evolution , as asteroseismology has opened up a window into their interiors . </S>",
    "<S> such insights are a direct result of the unprecedented data from space missions corot and _ kepler _ as well as recent theoretical advances . </S>",
    "<S> eclipsing binaries are also fundamental astrophysical objects , and when coupled with asteroseismology , binaries provide two independent methods to obtain masses and radii and exciting opportunities to develop highly constrained stellar models . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of discovering pulsating red giants in eclipsing binary systems is therefore an important goal that could potentially offer very robust characterization of these systems . until recently </S>",
    "<S> , only one case has been discovered with _ kepler_. we cross - correlate the detected red - giant and eclipsing - binary catalogs from _ kepler _ data to find possible candidate systems . </S>",
    "<S> light - curve modeling and mean properties measured from asteroseismology are combined to yield specific measurements of periods , masses , radii , temperatures , eclipse timing variations , core rotation rates , and red - giant evolutionary state . after using three different techniques to eliminate false positives , out of the 70 systems common to the red - giant and eclipsing - binary catalogs we find 13 strong candidates ( 12 previously unknown ) to be eclipsing binaries , one to be an non - eclipsing binary with tidally induced oscillations , and 10 more to be hierarchical triple systems , all of which include a pulsating red giant . </S>",
    "<S> the systems span a range of orbital eccentricities , periods , and spectral types f , g , k , and m for the companion of the red giant . </S>",
    "<S> one case even suggests an eclipsing binary composed of two red - giant stars and another of a red giant with a @xmath0-scuti star . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of multiple pulsating red giants in eclipsing binaries provides an exciting test bed for precise astrophysical modeling , and follow - up spectroscopic observations of many of the candidate systems are encouraged . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting highly constrained stellar parameters will allow , for example , the exploration of how binary tidal interactions affect pulsations when compared to the single - star case . </S>"
