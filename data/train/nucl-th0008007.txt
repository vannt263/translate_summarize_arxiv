    "an extended @xmath9 force model @xcite has been applied to even-@xmath3 nuclei in the @xmath6 shell region , in the previous paper @xcite ( hereafter referred to as ( i ) ) .",
    "the exact shell model calculations have shown that the @xmath10 interaction well reproduces the observed energy levels and @xmath11 transition probabilities of the collective yrast states as well as the binding energies in the @xmath3=46 , 48 and 50 nuclei with @xmath2 .",
    "the correspondence between theory and experiment is almost comparable to that attained by the full @xmath12 shell model calculations with realistic effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 or @xmath14 force @xcite has been regarded as a schematic interaction which represents typical correlations in nuclei .",
    "the results in ( i ) , however , told us that the extended @xmath9 force accompanied by the @xmath1-independent proton - neutron ( @xmath15-@xmath16 ) force @xmath17 is more than a mere schematic interaction and reflects the important aspects of the real interaction .",
    "the interaction serves for quantitative description of nuclear structure in the @xmath12 shell region .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the discussion of dufour and zuker @xcite that the residual part of a realistic effective interaction obtained after extracting the monopole terms is dominated by the multipole forces ( @xmath18 , @xmath0 _ etc . _ ) . in our model",
    ", the @xmath17 force nicely plays the role of the average monopole field and recovers the deficiency of the binding energy given by the @xmath14 force .",
    "the calculated results in ( i ) , however , revealed two flaws of the @xmath10 interaction : ( 1 ) noncollective states except the collective yrast states have a tendency to go down ; ( 2 ) binding energies and level schemes become worse as @xmath19 separates from @xmath20 , especially when @xmath19 is close to 28 as @xmath5ca .",
    "these flaws remind us of the divergence from experiment when the kuo - brown ( kb ) interaction @xcite is applied to systems of many valence nucleons @xmath5ca , @xmath21ca etc @xcite .",
    "the divergence was cured by modifying the monopole components of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 interaction matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the power of the modified interaction kb3 @xcite was shown in the exact shell model calculations @xcite .",
    "the modified aspect of another effective interaction fpd6 @xcite refers also to the monopole terms @xcite .",
    "these indicate the importance of the monopole terms in spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "our interaction has the most important term @xmath17 as the average monopole field but does not include the monopole terms which affect spectroscopy .",
    "it is a natural next concern to investigate whether the additional monopole terms can remove or not the flaws mentioned above .    for this purpose ,",
    "we carry out exact shell model calculations in the same model space ( @xmath24 ) as in ( i ) , where the model space was shown to be useful when the average monopole field ( @xmath17 ) independent of the extent of space is properly treated @xcite .",
    "we introduce additional monopole terms so that their forms are as simple as possible and the number of new parameters is minimal .",
    "the modified interaction gives us satisfactory results for the @xmath6 shell nuclei .",
    "this paper presents only a short review for even-@xmath3 nuclei , because the conclusions in ( i ) for the collective yrast states of @xmath2 even-@xmath3 nuclei are hardly changed .",
    "our major attention is devoted to odd-@xmath3 nuclei , the structure of which is expected to be sensitive to the effective interaction employed .",
    "there are successful works by martnez - pinedo _",
    "et al_. @xcite in which the @xmath3=47 and 49 nuclei are exhaustively studied by the full @xmath12 shell model with the kb3 interaction .",
    "we examine the quality of our model by comparing our results with theirs as well as experimental ones .",
    "we shall also show that our model describes @xmath3=51 nuclei very well .    in section 2 ,",
    "the additional monopole terms are introduced into our model and new parameters are determined for @xmath5ca and @xmath25ti .",
    "section 3 makes a report about the effects of the modification on even-@xmath3 nuclei .",
    "section 4 examines the results of calculations in the cross conjugate nuclei ( @xmath25ti , @xmath21v ) and ( @xmath25v , @xmath21cr ) .",
    "the results for @xmath3=51 are shown in section 5 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 6 .",
    "we start with the same model as in ( i ) , _ i.e. _ , the @xmath10 interaction in the model space @xmath26 with the following parameter set called `` set a '' in this paper ( see ( i ) in detail ) : @xmath27 this model succeeds in describing the collective yrast states of @xmath2 nuclei , but can not well reproduce binding energies and level schemes in nuclei with @xmath4 .",
    "we consider @xmath5ca as a conspicuous example in fig .",
    "the ground - state energy calculated with the parameter set a is -3.72 mev against the experimental energy -7.04 mev .",
    "the obtained level scheme is shown in the first column a in fig .",
    "there is a significant discrepancy between the original model ( column a ) and experiment ( column exp ) .",
    "we used the naive single - particle energies with small spaces from the observed levels of @xmath28ca in the set a. one may attribute the lowering of excited states to the small spaces @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the single - particle energies , however , do not very much affect the level scheme in the @xmath14 force model , as mentioned in ( i ) . if a little strengthened @xmath0 force is used for the single - particle energies of kuo and brown @xcite , energy levels obtained are almost unchanged for the collective states in @xmath2 nuclei .",
    "the effect on @xmath5ca is shown in the second column b of fig .",
    "the small energy gap between @xmath31 ( the ground state ) and @xmath32 is little improved .",
    "the use of the kuo - brown single - particle energies which are often employed will be convenient for comparison of our interaction with other effective interactions .",
    "we therefore use the new set of parameters ( called `` set b '' ) for the @xmath14 force in this paper , @xmath33    in @xmath5ca , the dominant component of the ground state @xmath31 is the neutron configuration @xmath34 , and main components of the lowest excited states are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the deep binding energy of @xmath31 is probably due to the large correlation energy of the closed subshell configuration @xmath34 , which is given by @xmath37 if we enlarge the value of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , we can get a deep binding energy of @xmath5ca .",
    "the enlargement of the @xmath6 interaction matrix elements gives a smaller energy gain to the excited states than @xmath31 , and hence extends the energy gap between @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath38 energy gap is further increased by weakening the interaction matrix elements @xmath39 ( @xmath40 or @xmath8 ) .",
    "note that only the isovector interactions with @xmath23 take action in @xmath5ca .",
    "therefore , a simple way to improve the binding energy and level scheme of @xmath5ca is to add the following correction to the isovector @xmath41 interactions : @xmath42 where @xmath43_{jm\\tau\\kappa}/\\sqrt{1+\\delta_{ab}}$ ] . neglecting the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath44 , in this paper",
    ", we make further simplification @xmath45 then , we have the isovector correction @xmath46 which belongs to the monopole terms discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath47 we can expect @xmath48 being attractive and @xmath49 being repulsive , from the above consideration .",
    "trial calculations in @xmath5ca recommend the following corrections to the parameter set b , which we call `` set c '' : @xmath50 the parameter set c yields the level scheme in the third column c of fig .",
    "the agreement with the observed levels is satisfactory .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] testifies that the @xmath14 force is very much improved by adding the isovector monopole terms as eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "let us test the validity of @xmath46 with the parameters ( [ eq:7 ] ) in odd-@xmath3 nuclei which are sensitive to the interaction employed .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates the comparison between calculated yrast levels and observed ones in @xmath25ti , where only negative - parity states are considered in our model space @xmath51 .",
    "the results in the columns a , b and c are obtained by using the parameter sets a , b and c , respectively . the results",
    "a and b show that the @xmath14 force fairly well reproduces the collective ground - state band on the @xmath52 state but lays the noncollective low - spin states @xmath53 and @xmath54 too much lower .",
    "this tendency is one of the flaws of the @xmath14 force .",
    "the column c indicates that the isovector monopole terms in @xmath46 push the @xmath53 and @xmath54 states up to the correct positions .",
    "however , @xmath46 disturbs the order of the adjacent levels @xmath55 and @xmath56 at low energy and lowers the energies of high - spin states above @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , the introduction of @xmath46 changes the binding energy of not only @xmath5ca but also the other nuclei .",
    "especially , the additional isovector pairing interactions @xmath58 operate on the main configurations of the ground states and cause overbinding .    these secondary troubles can be cured by introducing additional isoscalar @xmath59 monopole terms and by weakening the @xmath1-independent isoscalar force @xmath17 ( note that they are @xmath15-@xmath16 interactions ) .",
    "first , let us write the isoscalar correction @xmath60 in a form similar to @xmath46 @xmath61 we determine the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 so that the inverse order of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are restored and the high - spin levels get near to the observed ones .",
    "secondly , we weaken the strength @xmath64 of @xmath17 so as to obtain relatively good binding energies for nuclei from @xmath3=42 to @xmath3=51 as a whole .",
    "the obtained parameter set , which we call `` set d '' , is @xmath65    the parameter set d yields the level scheme in the fourth column d of fig .",
    "the energy levels of the ground - state band are well reproduced as those of the original model a and the @xmath53 and @xmath54 levels lie at good positions .",
    "the agreement with the observed levels is considerably good .",
    "the @xmath15-@xmath16 interactions @xmath60 and @xmath17 do not affect the spectrum of the @xmath5ca nucleus which has only valence neutrons .",
    "the third column of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath5ca is nothing but the result obtained by using the parameter set d. we can determine the strengths of @xmath62 and @xmath63 also in @xmath66v , because the relative energy of the lowest @xmath22 and @xmath23 states in odd - odd nuclei is sensitive to these parameters .",
    "if we enlarge the absolute values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we get better energies for @xmath22 low - spin states but too high energies for @xmath22 high - spin states in @xmath66v .",
    "the same tendency is seen in the column d of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the larger the values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 become , the higher the high - spin levels go up .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] say that the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath49 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 must not change too much from the values in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) .    using the parameter set d",
    ", we obtain the ground - state energies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the obtained result is compared with the result of ( i ) ( cal a ) and with the experimental ground - state energies ( see ( i ) ) .",
    "the modification in this paper improves the binding energies of nuclei with large @xmath68 such as the ca isotopes , as compared with the original model .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] , however , tells slight overbinding of the @xmath2 nuclei with small @xmath68 .",
    "for instance , the model ( denoted by + ) lowers a little the excitation energies of the @xmath23 and @xmath69 isobaric analogue states in @xmath5cr , while the original model ( denoted by @xmath70 ) reproduces them .",
    "we keep the fixed values ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) of the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 for all the @xmath3=42 - 51 nuclei in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , but the figure suggests that the additional monopole terms are too strong for the @xmath3=50 and @xmath3=51 nuclei with large @xmath68 . possibly the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 should have @xmath3 dependence .",
    "the present modification still leaves a room for fine improvement .",
    "our concern is , however , to sketch out functions of various typical interactions .",
    "the guiding principle in this paper is to cure the above - mentioned two flaws of the original model by using as few number of parameters as possible .",
    "we are content with the results in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . the modified model with the parameter set d fairly well reproduces the binding energies and level schemes of @xmath5ca and @xmath25ti .",
    "we shall examine this modified model in the following sections .",
    "let us see the effects of the additional monopole terms on even - a nuclei , to which the original model without these terms is applied in ( i ) .",
    "the original @xmath10 interaction well describes the collective yrast states of @xmath2 even - even nuclei .",
    "the additional monopole terms with the parameters ( [ eq:9 ] ) have little effect on these nuclei , though we do not show figures of the results except @xmath73cr .",
    "the discussions about the collective yrast states of @xmath66ti , @xmath5cr and @xmath73cr in ( i ) remain valid also in the present modified model . the level structure including non - yrast levels and @xmath74 in the ground - state band are hardly changed in @xmath66ti and @xmath5cr .",
    "the backbending plot of the @xmath5cr rotational band is fairly well and the quality is the same as that in ( i ) . speaking strictly",
    ", the additional monopole terms do not improve the excitation energies of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the backbending region .",
    "the somewhat awkward change from the most collective states ( @xmath78 ) to the high - spin states in the calculated ground - state band of @xmath5cr seems to originate in the @xmath14 force .",
    "the modified model ( d ) produces a little better level structure than the original model ( a ) in @xmath73cr , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . not only the yrast levels but also other levels correspond better to the observed levels .",
    "the low - spin states @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the high - spin states @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 come nearer to the observed positions . in @xmath73cr , however , the @xmath74 values between the most collective yrast states are considerably reduced : @xmath91 in e@xmath92@xmath93 is 197 for @xmath94 ; 277 for @xmath95 ; 122 for @xmath96 ; 121 for @xmath97 in the calculation d , while it is 215 for @xmath94 ; 302 for @xmath95 ; 211 for @xmath96 ; 200 for @xmath97 in the calculation a. the modification of the model has a tendency to push high - spin yrast states upward , as seen in fig . [ fig4 ] . the same tendency is observed in the results of @xmath66ti and @xmath5cr .",
    "the modified model works clearly better as compared with the original model , when @xmath19 separates from @xmath20 , as in @xmath5ca .",
    "we show the level scheme of @xmath73ti as a good example in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where yrast levels and other low - lying levels obtained by the original model ( a ) and modified one ( d ) are compared with the observed levels .",
    "the additional monopole terms move the yrast levels above @xmath98 very nearer to the observed ones , and push the non - yrast levels upward , laying them at good positions .",
    "next , we examine the applicability of our modified model in odd - odd nuclei which are most sensitive to the interaction employed . the previous paper ( i )",
    "has shown that the @xmath10 interaction can describe the yrast level structure in @xmath66v , @xmath5v and @xmath73mn beyond expectation .",
    "the introduction of the additional monopole terms reproduces relatively better results in these nuclei . in @xmath66v , for instance , the lowest @xmath99 state with @xmath22 lies at 0.24 mev in the original model a , while it lies at 0.59 mev , coming near to the observed excitation energy 0.80 mev , in the modified model d. the yrast and non - yrast levels correspond better to the observed ones in the present modified model , though the high - spin state @xmath100 goes up a little .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the relative positions of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 states are improved also in @xmath73mn . the original model ( a ) lays the lowest @xmath22 state with @xmath101 below the @xmath23 , @xmath31 state , but the modified model ( d ) correctly yields the ground state with @xmath23 , @xmath102 .",
    "if we regard the @xmath22 yrast levels with @xmath103 as a collective band on the band - head state @xmath98 , the band is well reproduced by our model .",
    "the additional monopole terms push non - yrast ( noncollective ) levels toward the observed ones .",
    "the yrast states with smaller spins ( @xmath104 ) than the band - head state , however , remain at low energy , and hence the order of low - lying levels does not correspond to the experimental order .    the same problem is observed in odd - odd nuclei away from @xmath105 , though the introduction of the additional monopole terms is very effective in improving the level scheme .",
    "the modified model well describes the collective yrast band , but can not reproduce the correct order of low - lying levels and fails to give the correct ground state in @xmath5v and @xmath5sc . in @xmath5v ,",
    "the lowest state @xmath32 is at -0.20 mev below the ground state @xmath106 in the calculation d. the difference between the calculated and observed yrast levels is 0.5 mev at most .",

    "the additional monopole terms produce very improved results .",
    "the correspondences of the excitation energies and level density between theory and experiment become better in the modified model d. although the calculation can not reproduce the correct ground state , the discrepancy does not exceed 0.4 mev .",
