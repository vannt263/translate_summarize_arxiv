    "@xcite have calculated the following quantity , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 mean the number of participants ( nucleons ) and number of collision particles in au - au collisions .",
    "it depends on the centrality cuts .",
    "the function @xmath10 is an increasing function , as @xmath8 increases .    in this paper , instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we consider the following physical quantity , @xmath11 where @xmath2 , and @xmath12 . in fig .",

    "they suggest us that there is scaling among @xmath5 s with different centrality cuts . thus @xmath5 is named a kind of the probability density , because @xmath13 , where @xmath5 is function of @xmath14 only this fact probably implies that the stochastic approach is available in analyses of @xmath5 s are the probability distributions , which are function of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    ", the fokker - planck equation is considered . in the third one , concrete analyses are presented . in the final one , concluding remarks are given .",
    "it is well known that the rapidity ( @xmath24 ) is a kind of the velocity . moreover , in collisions leading particles in the beam and target nuclei , i.e. , nucleons in gold at rhic experiments , collide each other , lose their energies and emit various particles .",
    "in other words , there are fluctuations in the rapidity space or the pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "thus we would like to assume that a damping law governs the rapidity space @xmath25 where @xmath26 or @xmath14 , @xmath21 and @xmath27 are the frictional coefficient and the white noise , respectively . from eq .",

    "equation ( [ eq4 ] ) is called the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( o - u ) process @xcite . to look for the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , we have to assume the source functions at `` time '' @xmath31 . the typical solution with @xmath32",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) is shown in fig . [",

    "[ fig4 ] , we examine whether or not the dispersion @xmath42 and @xmath43 depend on the centrality cuts . as is seen in figs . 3 and 4 , the scaling behavior among @xmath5 s at @xmath4 gev is explained by eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) with small changes in the dispersion @xmath42 .",
    "it can be said that the scaling behavior is explained by the o - u process with two sources at the beam ( @xmath44 or @xmath39 ) and target ( @xmath45 or @xmath40 ) rapidities . of course , it is obvious that the single source can not explain it .",

    "first of all , it can be stressed that there is the scaling among @xmath5 s with various centrality cuts at @xmath4 gev .",
    "second the scaling behavior of @xmath5 is described by the solutions of the fokker - planck equation , i.e . , eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath5 with the centrality cut 0 - 6% do not show singular /or particular phenomenon relating to signatures of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . of course",
    ", we should pay our attention that we are handling the averaged quantity in statistics . at present , however , it is difficult to conclude that the qgp is created , and the signature from the qgp are washed out by the strong interactions between hadrons , if the qgp is created .",
    "here we should carefully observe fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , there are small differences in @xmath5 s over the range @xmath48 with centrality cut 0 - 6% and others . to explore the differences more carefully ,",
    "we need @xmath5 with smaller centrality cuts , 0 - 3% @xmath49 0 - 5% .    moreover",
    ", we can add the following fact .",
    "very recently , phobos collaboration has reported the data on @xmath0 with centrality cut 0 - 6% at @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "they are compared with @xmath5 at @xmath4 gev in fig .",
    "roughly speaking , the scaling on @xmath5 holds between @xmath4 gev and 200 gev with the geometrical picture of the gold ( @xmath50 6 - 7 fm , @xmath51 1 - 2 fm , @xmath52 ) , we obtain the following values @xmath53 ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 or @xmath5 with the centrality cut 0 - 6% does not show the particular behavior relating to the qgp in the sense of average . to investigate the particular phenomena like the turbulence and/or deflagration in @xmath0",
    ", we need to analyse the single event with smaller centrality cut than 0 - 6% .",
    "moreover , analyses of event - by - event , for example the intermittency and the wavelet , seem to be necessary for @xmath0 with smaller centrality cut @xcite .",
