    "during the past years , different models have been developed in an attempt to explain the mechanism behind the single - spin asymmetries observed experimentally in high - energy hadronic interactions .",
    "the approach based on the study of the hadronic cross - section contribution given by the twist-3 components in the operator product expansion of parton matrix elements turns out to be particularly interesting : taking into account such terms provides a consistent model .",
    "however , at the same time the complexity of the calculational framework unfortunately increases , since twist-3 contribution are characterized by the presence of an additional gauge - field term , which in turn implies an _ extra gluon _ in the sub - processes , see for example  @xcite .",
    "restricting our analysis therefore to a particular class of processes ( pion production in proton  proton collisions ) , our principal aim is to identify which , if any , among all possible partonic sub - processes provide the dominant contributions to the asymmetry and to understand the origin of the suppression of the other terms",
    ". we can thus list a set of criteria ( which we call _ `` selection rules '' _ ) summarizing these mechanisms . to simplify our analysis",
    ", we shall extract a totally collinear cross - section formula , in the axial gauge and in the limit of @xmath5 , valid for large @xmath0 .",
    "we shall now go into detail , first by providing an expression for the twist-3 contribution to the cross - section through the study of the pole behavior of the bjorken variables , and then by analyzing the causes of the suppression of many other sub - processes .",
    "working in axial gauge , thus setting @xmath6 , allows us to write the twist-3 contribution to the cross - section in the following way : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the multi - parton matrix element and the index @xmath9 is completely transverse , due to gauge choice .",
    "moreover , in the axial gauge , the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath10 assumes a very simple form ( see @xcite , eq .",
    "7.3.30 ) : @xmath11 demonstrating that if @xmath10 is different from zero for @xmath12 , then @xmath8 must have a pole .",
    "the analysis of the hard part is also crucial for the pole structure ; there are two different possibilities for the extra gluon , generated at twist-3 , to interact significantly : with the on - shell fragmenting parton ( the so - called final - state interactions , fsi ) and with the on - shell parton coming from the unpolarized nucleon ( initial - state interactions , isi ) ; the important feature of these interactions is the presence of an extra internal propagator , whose dirac structure has the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the four - momentum of the on - shell parton and @xmath15 is the four - momentum of the polarized hadron .    by also taking into account the pole behavior originating in the multi - parton matrix element , it is possible to separate the trace over the dirac indices into two traces , each one with a different pole structure : the first , known as the _ single - pole _ contribution , where the @xmath16 term in the numerator cancels the pole contribution of the matrix element , and the other , called the _",
    "double - pole _ contribution , where no such cancelation occurs . in order to maintain the cross - section a real quantity ,",
    "we are forced to take the imaginary part of these poles , remembering that @xmath17 using these relations and integrating the derivative of the delta function by parts , we obtain the following expression for the twist-3 contribution to the cross - section : @xmath18 where we have omitted the color factors and the sum over flavor indices ; @xmath19 is the antisymmetric tensor in the transverse directions , @xmath20 is the multi - parton distribution function evaluated at the pole ( owing to the delta functions ) , @xmath21 is the unpolarized quark density and @xmath22 represents the hard - scattering partonic cross - sections , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 standing respectively for double pole and single pole .      given such an expression for the cross - section at twist three , we list here the set of principles we have adopted to identify the possibly dominant contributions :    * first , we expect dp contributions to be much more relevant than sp ones , owing to the presence of the derivative of the multiparton density function , which endows the asymmetry with a behavior in @xmath25 roughly as @xmath26 ( for @xmath1 approaching unity , the bjorken @xmath25 of the incoming parton also approaches unity ) , thus enhancing the contribution of such terms for growing @xmath1 ; * for @xmath5 and @xmath27 , we expect the @xmath28-channel diagrams to be dominant ; for the same reason , remembering the power suppression of the hard parts given in eq .",
    "[ prop ] , we expect fsi to give a greater contribution than isi ; * we neglected the contributions given by polarized gluons and by sea quarks since these may reasonably be expected to be small .    in order to test our model and the selection rules described above ,",
    "we have evaluated the single - spin asymmetries for the reaction @xmath29 for the star kinematical range ( @xmath30gev and 1.3gev/@xmath31gev/@xmath32 , see for example @xcite ) . restricting our analysis to the contribution given only by the @xmath28-channel diagram involved in the process , in fig .",
    "1a we present a comparison between the data points and the resulting prediction given by our model ; we note that there is good agreement with data for values of @xmath1 greater than @xmath33 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      * figure 1 . * * ( a ) * the theoretical curve represents the prediction for the ssa in @xmath34 production evaluated at @xmath35 gev / c , compared to star data points . *",
    "( b ) * here we plot the same curve as in fig .",
    "1a , compared to the fsi dp term in a quark  gluon ( here labeled _",
    "sub - process and the fsi dp in a quark ",
    "quark subprocess . +    in fig .",
    "1b we also plot the total asymmetry , but together with the contribution given by the two major sub - processes we have identified , i.e.  the @xmath28-channel fsi dp terms . comparing these curves",
    ", we can see how the two sub - processes mentioned provide almost entirely the value of the asymmetry in the kinematical range of @xmath36 ; for lower values of this variable , we expect all the neglected contribution to become more important .",
    "to summarize then :    * we have obtained an expression providing predictions for the single - spin asymmetries for pion production consistent with data , in a completely collinear framework , without appealing to any collinear expansion ; * using such an expression and a simple set of criteria , we have also been able to identify two largely dominant subprocesses , which are almost entirely responsible for the asymmetries in the @xmath5 limit",
