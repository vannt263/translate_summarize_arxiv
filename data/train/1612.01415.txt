    "application of the carbon onions in electric devices requires the information about its electron parameters like energy gap and fermi levels .    in the case of the bilayer onions which we investigate in this paper , the energy gap is given by the homo - lumo gap - the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the inner onion shell and of the highest occupied molecular orbital of the outer onion shell .",
