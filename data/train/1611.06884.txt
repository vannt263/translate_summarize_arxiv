    "the unknown nature and the mass of the neutrino are among the biggest unsolved mysteries of modern particle physics .",
    "observation of neutrinoless double beta ( 0@xmath7 ) decay could shed light onto these questions . the experimental search for neutrinoless",
    "0@xmath7 decay requires ultra sensitive detectors with a very low background rate like high purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors . the gerda  experiment  @xcite has set the strongest lower bound for the half - life of @xmath8 decay of @xmath3ge  @xcite .",
    "further generations of experiments with larger target masses have started or are in the planning stage  @xcite .    in order to improve the sensitivity of hpge detector based experiments ,",
    "an increase of detector mass in combination with a further reduction of the radioactive background is necessary . in the next generation of experiments",
    "the detector mass could amount to about a ton of detector material while a background rate below @xmath9  0.1cts/(roi@xmath10ton@xmath10yr )  in the energy region of interest ( roi ) will be necessary .",
    "this value is more than one order of magnitude lower than the level presently reached in gerda  phase  ii  @xcite . in order to achieve such a low background level",
    ", it is necessary to investigate and eventually reduce all possible background components .",
    "an important background contribution to all rare event searches is the natural radioactivity from isotopes of the @xmath0u , @xmath1u and @xmath2th decay chains .",
    "[ fig : chains ] depicts the relevant and accessible part of the chains .",
    "background in the roi can among others be induced by several @xmath11 lines originating from the decays of @xmath12bi and @xmath13tl that are above the @xmath14-value of @xmath8 decay in @xmath3ge , with @xmath15  =  2039kev .",
    "the most prominent one in general is the 2614.5kev line in @xmath13pb following the @xmath13tl @xmath16 decay .",
    "these long - lived uranium and thorium isotopes are omnipresent in the earth s crust  @xcite and are to be expected in any natural material and surrounding .",
    "the purification process of germanium during production of hpge crystals efficiently removes uranium and thorium .",
    "however , further processing steps in detector production and setup follow until the final deployment within the experiment .",
    "this might bring back some fraction of radioactivity , mostly on the surface .",
    "a tiny contamination of the bulk hpge with these elements can deteriorate the sensitivity of hpge experiments considerably .",
    "simulations suggest that contaminations of @xmath9@xmath17@xmath18bq / kg for @xmath0u and @xmath2th account for an expected background rate of 1cts/(roi@xmath10ton@xmath10yr )  and 0.2cts/(roi@xmath10ton@xmath10yr ) , respectively  ( * ? ? ? * and refs . therein ) when a roi of 4  kev around @xmath15  is assumed .",
    "thus , for future ton - scale experiments the bulk contamination of hpge can be a potential background source .",
    "this implies that the purity of hpge has to be controlled to a level lower than 10nbq / kg .    in this paper limits for the bulk contamination of hpge detectors by isotopes of the decay chains",
    "@xmath0u , @xmath1u and @xmath2th are given that are obtained from gerda  phase  i data .",
    "the spectrum of every detector was searched for a sequence of @xmath19 decays occuring in the decay chains . in most cases",
    "at least one of the decays was missing .",
    "if candidates for all @xmath19 decays exist the compartibility of the time distribution of the events with the expectation from the half lives is checked .",
    "the limits derived from gerda  phase  i data show for the first time that the bulk contamination of hpge can be controlled to a level of a few nbq / kg for the isotopes @xmath6th , @xmath5ac and @xmath4ra resulting from primordial @xmath0u , @xmath1u and @xmath2th .",
    "this demonstrates that bulk contamination of hpge with these isotopes is unlikely to limit a future ton - scale hpge experiment for the search of @xmath8 decay .",
    "overview of the relevant isotopes in the three natural decay chains @xmath2th ( th chain ) , @xmath1u ( u - ac chain ) and @xmath0u ( u - ra chain ) .",
    "energies , half - lives and branching ratios are given ]",
    "the gerda  experiment consists of an array of germanium detectors submerged into a cryostat filled with liquid argon ( lar ) .",
    "the cryostat has a diameter of 4 m and is placed inside a water tank with a diameter of 10 m . in phase",
    "i of the experiment , eight refurbished semi - coaxial hpge detectors from the heidelberg - moscow  @xcite and igex  @xcite experiments made from germanium isotopically enriched in @xmath3ge were deployed together with other semi - coaxial detectors with natural abundance  @xcite .",
    "some detectors had been replaced by five enriched broad energy germanium ( bege ) detectors  @xcite .",
    "details of the gerda  experimental setup can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for the current analysis , all data recorded in the period between december 2 , 2011 and september 5 , 2013 inclusive those of the natural detectors were used which expands slightly the data set of ref .",
    "@xcite to 26.14kg@xmath10yr . for the calibration of the energy scale gerda  uses @xmath6th sources .",
    "since the expected energy deposition of an internal @xmath19 background is above the highest energetic calibration peak at 2.6mev , data from calibration runs were also used in the analysis .",
    "while the increase of exposure is not significant ( @xmath202% ) , this extends the continuity of data taking which in turn improves the detection efficiency of the decay sequences ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : systematics ] ) .",
    "the longest live time for a subset of detectors corresponds to 543.8 days ( see table  [ tab : detectors ] ) .",
    "unphysical events due to electromagnetic noise or discharges are identified and rejected by a set of quality cuts .",
    "these cuts take into account parameters of the charge pulse , e.g. rise time and baseline fluctuations , and are described in ref .",
    "pile - up events , in which two distinct pulses are recorded during the digitization time window of 80@xmath18s , are also discarded  @xcite .",
    "events in coincidence with a muon trigger are rejected .",
    "the individual live times and masses of the detectors used in this analysis are listed in table  [ tab : detectors ] .",
    ".[tab : detectors ] detector masses and live times .",
    "the active mass of gtf112 and gtf45 have been estimated from the average of those of the four ang detectors [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     have passed ( which is a good assumption for the hdm and igex semi - coaxial detectors ) , the 90% c.i .",
    "upper limit on the @xmath2th contamination  @xcite is @xmath214nbq / kg for @xmath2th . assuming secular equilibrium for the @xmath0u and @xmath2th decay chains and a roi window of 4kev , the expected background index contributions are @xmath22 and @xmath23cts/(roi@xmath10ton@xmath10yr ) , respectively .",
    "this analysis shows that hpge belongs among the most radiopure materials . with the same analysis with gerda phase ii data with an exposure of 100  kg@xmath10yr  we expect an improvement of the sensitivity to bulk alphas by a factor of roughly  5 , i.e. a sub nbq / kg sensitivity",
    "a search for a possible presence of contamination , originating from the uranium and thorium natural radioactivity series , in the bulk of hpge detectors in gerda  phase  i has been performed .",
    "no complete decay chain was observed . from the non - observation of full decay chains",
    "upper limits were derived for the concentrations and activities of @xmath6th , @xmath5ac and @xmath4ra in gerda  phase  i detectors .",
    "a contamination of detectors according to these limits would lead to a background index 0.1cts/(roi@xmath10ton@xmath10yr)in accordance with the requirements for a future ton scale double beta decay experiment based on germanium detectors .",
