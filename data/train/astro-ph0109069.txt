    "the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( cgro ) , one of nasa s four great observatories , was launched in 1991 april and operated in low earth orbit until controlled re - entry in 2000 june .",
    "cgro was responsible for many discoveries in the study of gamma ray bursts , accreting binaries , active galaxies , and pulsars ( gehrels & shrader 1997 ; kniffen & gehrels 1997 ; leonard & wanjek 2000 ) .",
    "the quest for the origin of gamma ray bursts led to the development and flight of the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the cgro .",
    "batse pointed the way to the extragalactic origin of gamma ray bursts through mapping of burst location and number - brightness distributions ( meegan 1992 ) .",
    "in addition to batse s primary science goals , its nine years of nearly continuous operation and all - sky capability allowed monitoring of the low energy gamma ray / hard x - ray sky using the earth occultation technique ( eot ) . prior to batse",
    ", the method had not been used widely by the astrophysics community for gathering spectral and intensity information about celestial sources .",
    "we show that the earth occultation technique , applied to a well - calibrated multiple detector system and without sophisticated imaging hardware , is a viable and inexpensive method for monitoring the high energy sky .",
    "it is particularly suitable for uncollimated devices such as background or anti - compton suppression shields , which are commonly used in x - ray and gamma - ray astronomy missions .",
    "we therefore present here a detailed discussion of how the earth occultation technique was applied to batse data .",
    "a listing of acronyms and abbreviations used throughout the text can be found in appendix a.    historically , monitoring of the high energy sky was accomplished in the energy range of @xmath01 - 20 kev using various types of scanning pinhole cameras , modulation collimators , or position - sensitive detectors .",
    "x - ray missions such as _ uhuru _ ( giacconi 1972 ) , _ vela 5b _ ( conner , evans & belian 1969 ) , the _ ginga _ all - sky monitor ( tsunemi 1989 ) , _ ariel 5 _ ( holt 1976 ) the granat and eureca watch monitors ( lund , 1986 ; brandt , 1994 ; castro - tirado , 1994 ) and most recently , the all - sky monitor on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) ( bradt , rothschild & swank 1993 ; levine 1996 ) have been crucial in discovering and monitoring of x - ray transients , investigating long - term periodic variations in more persistent sources , and detecting other phenomena associated with the x - ray sky .",
    "batse complements these instruments by monitoring the energy range from 20 kev up to about 1 mev .",
    "this covers the lower energy portion of the nonthermal regime , where the emission is produced by a variety of processes such as compton up - scattering of soft photons by energetic particles , bremsstrahlung , and synchrotron radiation .",
    "it was realized prior to launch ( fishman 1982 ; 1984 ; 1989 ) that batse could serve as a sensitive all - sky monitor of point - like gamma ray sources .",
    "earth occultations of point sources allow sampling of high energy fluxes using the sharp step - like features in the background data for both pulsed and nonpulsed sources ( paciesas 1985 ) .",
    "variations on timescales of hours to years can be investigated .",
    "the method allowed batse to be very successful at locating new transients , detecting unusual intensity or spectral changes , and stimulating observations in other wavelength bands . because the eot was enhanced and used extensively during the operational period of cgro , we present its use in various forms , and discuss a number of aspects of the technique such as source identification , sensitivity , and systematic error .",
    "pre - launch discussions of the method can be found in paciesas ( 1985 ) and fishman ( 1989 ) .",
    "discussions concerning the post - launch performance and expanded capabilities can be found in harmon ( 1992 ) , wilson ( 1992 ) , zhang ( 1993 ) , and zhang ( 1994a ) . preliminary surveys of detected sources can be found in harmon ( 1993 ) and robinson ( 1997 ) .",
    "an imaging capability was added after launch , based on the radon transform , which greatly improved our ability to locate and identify gamma ray sources ( zhang 1993 , 1994a ) .",
    "another powerful application of batse as an all - sky monitor was the ability to to detect and monitor pulsars using fourier analysis or epoch folding techniques .",
    "a detailed description of these methods and results from batse data can be found in bildsten ( 1997 ) .",
    "the earth occultation analysis technique utilizes the large area detectors ( lads ) on batse , which are sensitive to photons above 20 kev .",
    "compton gamma ray observatory _ and placement of the batse detector modules on the spacecraft are shown in fig .",
    "the lads are composed of sodium iodide ( nai(tl ) ) crystals , 1.27 cm ( 0.5 in ) thick by 50.8 cm ( 20 in ) across ( 2025 @xmath1 total area of one detector ) .",
    "eight modules are mounted on the corners of the cgro with normal vectors perpendicular to the faces of a regular octahedron .",
    "any point on the sky can viewed by four detectors at angles less than 90@xmath2 to the source direction .",
    "this gives batse a capability of obtaining crude locations to within a few degrees using the count rates from a combination of detectors and the known response of each detector from photons directly from the source , and source photons scattered off the atmosphere ( pendleton 1995a ) .",
    "this is routinely done to locate gamma ray bursts to within an accuracy of a few degrees ( pendleton 1999 ) .",
    "a full description of the batse detectors can be found in a number of places ; see , for example , fishman ( 1984 , 1989 ) .",
    "although earth occultation features have been used with other gamma ray instruments to restrict the location of point sources ( e.g. , wheaton 1982 ) , to our knowledge , only batse made use of the method for direct measurement of point source emission .",
    "some earth occultation measurements have been performed with the batse spectroscopy detectors ( sds ) ( mcnamara , harmon & harrison 1995 ; 1996 ; paciesas et al .",
    "1998 ; mcnamara 1998 ) .",
    "these detectors have a much smaller effective area for source monitoring ( @xmath0600 @xmath1 ) than the lads , but do have an additional low energy bandpass around 10 kev . here",
    "we discuss the method as applied only to the large area detectors .",
    "the earth occultation technique was also developed and applied to batse data in a separate , parallel effort at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) ( skelton 1994 ; ling 1996 ) .",
    "the jpl group has recently published a description of their approach ( the enhanced batse occultation package ( ebop ) ) , and a compendium of measurements using the technique covering the 1991 may to 1994 october epoch ( ling 2000 ) .",
    "the method used by jpl was developed specifically for extraction of flux histories and spectra of point gamma ray sources .",
    "there are primarily two major differences between the jpl method and the method we describe in this paper .",
    "first , ebop uses a semi - physical model for the detector background counting rates .",
    "the model is based on expected contributions of low energy gamma ray fluxes local to the low earth orbit ( leo ) environment .",
    "these include cosmic ray secondary radiation and activation products from orbital passes through radiation fields in leo .",
    "the jpl global background model consists of a mix of the local radiation components and a combination ( determined by the fit ) of the sd counting rates as a predictor of the low energy background in the lads .",
    "secondly , the extraction of source signals is performed usually in one - day segments , with a single fit including terms for _ all _ sources in the ebop catalog with no_a priori _ assumptions of their intensity .",
    "the jpl method has the advantage of potentially greater statistical accuracy at the expense of increased systematic error .",
    "the method appears to give reasonable results for bright , hard sources such as the crab nebula and cygnus x-1 . in some cases , for relatively weak sources , such as the neutron star binaries circinus x-1 and scutum x-1 , the jpl method yields significant hard emission greater than @xmath0200 kev , which is uncharacteristic for this class of sources ( see discussion in sec . 3.2 and fig .",
    "8 , plates 10 and 75 of ling 2000 ) .",
    "we have not been able to confirm these unusually hard spectra with the marshall space flight center ( msfc ) method , nor are they reported by other high energy observatories .    instead of the physical inputs used in the jpl fitting procedure ,",
    "the msfc method uses simple polynomials as the set of basis functions for fitting the background and extracting the source signal ( see section 3 for details ) .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the background is smooth on a timescale of a few minutes , as discussed in section 3 , with respect to count rate variations caused by cosmic ray secondaries , activation , and other local background components .",
    "this assumption breaks down only during times of high solar flare activity , gamma ray bursts and a few flaring gamma ray sources , which are either excluded from the analysis , or flagged later at the discretion of the observer ( see sec .",
    "2.2 for a discussion of data selection procedures ) .",
    "the only source terms included in the fit are those which are thought to be active during the short four - minute time windows .",
    "we chose to adopt the method described here over that of ebop to minimize the effect of unpredictable systematic error , and because of the real - time needs of the msfc all - sky monitoring effort .",
    "the msfc method also lends itself well to an iterative approach in selecting sources that may potentially interfere with the source of interest ( soi ) , so that a best solution comes from building up a knowledge of the sky region within a few degrees surrounding the source .",
    "more recently , southampton university has undertaken a more rigorous approach in modeling the batse backgrounds in order to generate all - sky images and extract of source fluxes using earth occultation ( shaw 2000 ) .",
    "this method incorporates the physical background components discussed above and a mass model of the _ compton observatory _ in a monte carlo simulation using the radiation transport code geant as was done with the european space agency international gamma ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) ( lei 1999 ) .",
    "the result of the simulation is the _ a priori _ determination of the total diffuse background in the lads at any orientation and geomagnetic coordinates of the earth .",
    "this methods offers the possibility of removing the source signal without the need for a simultaneous fit to the background .",
    "the lads are well - suited to earth occultation measurements because of their sensitivity , uniformity in energy range , and stabilized gain .",
    "data from two or more lads can be easily combined or fitted jointly , depending on the application .",
    "there are two different data types which are most convenient for occultation measurements : discla ( lad discriminator data ) and cont ( or lad continuous data ) which cover the same energy range ( 20 kev - 1 mev ) .",
    "the discla data type provides four energy channels binned every 1.024 seconds , and the cont datatype provides 16 channels every 2.048 seconds .    prior to application of the earth occultation method , proper data selection is required to remove large fluctuations that may affect the fitting of occultation steps . when data are flagged in one stage of the selection process , they are then excluded from the occultation analysis .",
    "the first stage of the data selection is performed onboard .",
    "several different datatypes are scanned , including the discla type , by comparing the local background count rate to new data as they are acquired .",
    "an event may  trigger \" the gamma ray burst ( grb ) acquisition mode when a high data rate is encountered relative to the background in two or more lads ( meegan 1992 ) .",
    "high rate events may be caused by bursts , solar flares , bremsstrahlung from electron precipitation ( aschwanden , schwartz & dennis 1998 ) , terrestrial gamma ray flashes ( fishman 1994a ) , or even flaring galactic sources ( mallozzi 1993 ) .",
    "any triggered events are flagged automatically in the datastream and identified later .",
    "the second stage of the selection process consists of manual inspection for other events that may escape the burst trigger , yet generate large transient flares .",
    "these are of a somewhat longer timescale than grbs , usually a few tens of seconds to minutes .",
    "the fluxes from these events are generally easy to identify based on their observed timing and spectral properties .",
    "time periods containing transient background features large enough to be detected visually ( about 10% of the total background counting rate ) are flagged and excluded from occultation analysis along with the triggered events .",
    "the vast majority of these events are gamma ray fluxes solar flares or bremsstrahlung from precipitating electrons .",
    "the last stage of the data selection consists of additional flagging of very short ( @xmath3 1 sec ) cosmic ray events .",
    "these occur in only one lad at a time when a heavy cosmic ray , such as an iron nucleus , deposits a large amount of energy into the scintillation medium .",
    "this is observed as a sharp , positive - going spike in the background data for one time bin .",
    "it is caused by long - lived phosphorescence characteristic of impurities in the nai(tl ) crystal ( fishman & austin 1976 ) .",
    "the affected data bins are flagged using a spike filter prior to occultation as well as pulsar measurements .",
    "an interesting aside to the standard data treatment discussed above is that bright and extremely variable galactic sources are occasionally detected via the burst trigger .",
    "such occurrences do not affect earth occultation analyses to a large degree because the amount of data excluded in the data selection process due to intrinsic source variability is statistically insignificant . however , the extremes of variability are reduced if the burst trigger is enabled by the soi , since the cont or discla data at the time of the trigger are rejected in our data analysis procedure .",
    "the sources for which this was known to have occurred during the mission are a 0535 + 262 ( finger , wilson & harmon 1996 ) ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , cygnus x-1 ( fishman et al .",
    "1994b ) , gro j0422 + 32 ( mallozzi 1993 ) , gro j1744 - 28 ( kouveliotou 1996 ) , and 4u 1700 - 377 ( rubin 1996a ) , and soft gamma ray repeaters ( woods 1999 ) .",
    "for some flaring episodes of these sources , the batse burst trigger threshold was raised temporarily in order to minimize the number of non - grb triggers .",
    "normally , the likelihood of a source being rejected in this manner for earth occultation measurement is rather small due to the great difference in peak brightness of these sources and that of grbs .",
    "it should be noted that when data are flagged and removed from the analysis , in actuality , the data are recoverable by re - analyzing the cont or discla data with less restrictive filtering criteria .      in one orbit around the earth , two occultation step features , a rise and set pair , will be superimposed on the background counting rate as each point source is occulted .",
    "a measurement can be made of the intensity of a source in each energy channel at rise or set . in practice ,",
    "two measurements per _ every _ orbit are not achieved .",
    "the most common reasons are passages through the lower van allen radiation belt at the south atlantic anomaly when the detector voltage is turned off , or that cgro is out of line - of - sight contact with the nasa tracking & data relay satellites ( tdrss ) , and data which have been flagged and are not available for analysis .",
    "high declination sources ( @xmath441@xmath2 ) also experience an interruption of occultations near the orbital poles ( see appendix b ) .",
    "source confusion , where occultations of one source are indistinguishable from another , also limits the number of usable occultation steps .",
    "the impact of these effects combined causes earth occultation coverage averaged over one precession cycle ( @xmath052d ) to range between 80%-90% , at best , and at worst , about 50% .",
    "the attenuation of gamma rays by the earth s atmosphere and the variation in thickness of the air mass along the line of sight to the x - ray source produce the step - like features in the detector count rate as a function of time .",
    "the attenuation is 50% for 100 kev photons that pass through the atmosphere along a line of sight with minimum altitude of 70 km . for a typical orbital speed of 8 km / s , the duration of the occultation step for a source rising or setting in the plane of the spacecraft orbit is about 10 seconds .",
    "therefore occultations are relatively sharp features superimposed on the generally slower background variations caused by orbital motion around the earth .",
    "several examples of occultation features , or  steps \" , in the discla and cont data are shown in fig .",
    "2 . except where otherwise noted , the date and time convention used in this paper is _ truncated julian date _ ( tjd ) = julian date ( jd ) - 2,440,000.5 and _ seconds of day",
    "_ measured from the tjd start .",
    "3 shows a close - up view of individual occultation steps with fitting functions based on a model for the atmospheric attenuation for gamma rays ( see section 3.1 ) .    the accuracy to which the timing and magnitude of these steps can be fit determines the performance of the earth occultation technique .",
    "we discuss three forms of the technique from which information can be obtained using batse data : ( 1 ) the flux and spectra extraction method , where we assume _ a priori _ knowledge of source locations , and ( 2 ) the step search and ( 3 ) the occultation imaging methods , where the source location is not required . methods ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are best - suited for new source searches .",
    "an overall comparison of these approaches is given in table 1 .",
    "in appendices b and c , we supplement the discussion of the eot by developing the mathematical framework for earth occultation from an orbiting spacecraft .",
    "this includes expressions for timing of earth occultation features and their use for locating point sources .",
    "the count rate for a source in the lad is extracted by simultaneously fitting occultation step features with terms for each source in the fit and a quadratic polynomial to represent the detector background .",
    "the fit is performed independently for each energy channel .",
    "each occultation step , rise or set , is fit over a time _",
    "t@xmath5@xmath6 to _ t@xmath5+@xmath7 _ _ , which we refer to as the _ fitting window_. _",
    "t@xmath5 _ represents the occultation time of the soi and also the center of the time window .",
    "use of a quadratic form for the background restricts the half - width of the fitting window , @xmath7 , to no more than about 120 seconds of data .",
    "the modeled detector count rate @xmath8 in each energy channel can be represented as @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the coefficients of the background model ( to second order ) and @xmath11 are the source count rates including the soi and other bright sources with occultation steps occurring within the fitting window , and @xmath12 are the atmospheric transmission functions .",
    "the number of source terms _ n _ is kept to a minimum for greatest sensitivity , at the expense of incurring some systematic error .",
    "this method is similar to that adopted in wheaton ( 1995 ) for multi - parameter least squares fitting of data when the detector background is time variable and individual measurements are of low statistical quality .",
    "we assume that the background is smooth and adequately fit by the second order polynomial on the order of the size of the fitting window , 2@xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the failure of this assumption is usually caused by the presence in the data of bright pulsars , weak bursts , solar flares , and other disturbances on the timescale of the fitting window .",
    "problematic stretches of data are mostly removed in the data selection process discussed in sec .",
    "experience shows that there are non - poissonian components that remain in the data , and must be accounted for in the analysis of results . however , most of these effects add incoherently on timescales of a day or longer .",
    "the occultation features are represented via a model function for the transmission @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the energy - dependent mass attenuation coefficient of gamma rays in air ( storm & israel 1970 ; chupp 1975 ) and _ a(h ) _ is the air mass computed along the line of sight at a given altitude _ h(t)_. _",
    "a(h ) _ is interpolated from a table of air masses ( w. wheaton , private communication ) for values of _ h _ between 50 and 110 km , and is based on the u.s .",
    "international commercial aviation organization ( icao ) standard atmosphere ( 1962 ) .",
    "use of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : mod_rate ] ) and ( [ eqn : transm ] ) requires precise knowledge of the spacecraft ephemeris ( time and position ) , the direction to the soi , and a model of the earth that accounts for its non - sphericity ( see appendix c ) . to use the cont data at its full time resolution of 2.048s ,",
    "the position of the spacecraft at the center of the time bin must be known accurately . the spacecraft position is nominally interpolated for the center of the 2.048s time bin from the incoming ephemeris data . for most of cgro",
    "mission , the component of the position vector in the direction of spacecraft motion was known to less than 10 km . due to the sharpness of occultation profiles ( @xmath010s ) , ephemeris errors even on",
    "the order of 25 km downrange ( about 1 part in 2000 ) can shift the step model enough to seriously affect the flux measurement .",
    "a few ephemeris problems occurred during the mission , but were corrected in the data archive . the ability to measure the time of an occultation and the sharpness of earth occultation features",
    "can be exploited to determine the location of a source as outlined in appendices b and c.    a database of source locations , outburst times , and intensities provides information to determine whether terms for sources should be included in the fitting window .",
    "this database was built up as new sources were found either through occultation analysis ( light curves and images ) or from other instrument measurements .",
    "information about source outburst intensity levels as a function of time are read from the database by the analysis software before the flux measurement is performed .",
    "each energy channel in the source - pointed lads ( defined to be less than 60@xmath2 between the source direction and detector normal ) is fit independently to derive a count rate in each cont channel for all sources _ r@xmath16 _ as a function of time .",
    "the statistical error ( @xmath17 ) of the @xmath18th term at time @xmath19 is computed from the least squares fit of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mod_rate ] ) .",
    "some physical insight into the obtainable error from the earth occultation fits can be achieved by assuming a simple linear step function in place of the transmission function @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mod_rate ] ) and setting @xmath20=1 ( only the soi is considered ) . the uncertainty in the fit",
    "can then be extracted from the hessian , or information , matrix ( press 1992 ) , which is to first order @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a parameter that depends on the half - width , @xmath7 , the occultation step width , and the slope of the background across the fitting window .",

    "( [ eqn : mod_rate ] ) ) is accumulated as a function of time for later deconvolution from the instrument response .",
    "however , all the coefficients , including those for other sources in the fit , and the background terms , can be written to a file for later use .",
    "here we present examples illustrating the usefulness of the batse eot to measure source variability and differences in spectral behavior .",
    "the technique has been used to monitor spectral state transitions in the black hole candidates gx 339 - 4 ( harmon 1994 ; rubin 1998 ) and cyg x-1 ( zhang 1997 ) . during the operational lifetime of cgro ,",
    "outbursts of monitored sources , particularly unusual ones , were made known to the scientific community through various electronic media .",

    "the _ r@xmath16 _ in counts s@xmath25 per energy channel per lad , without correction for the detector response , are stored in a time - ordered file with a beginning and ending time specified by the user .",
    "energy spectra ( flux per energy channel ) and light curves showing the history of the source s intensity as a function of time can be generated from the raw history file .",
    "the octahedral geometry of batse insures that at least four detectors simultaneously view a point source anywhere on the sky .",
    "the angular sensitivity of the lads is maintained by combining statistics from two , three and ultimately four detectors at successively larger angles from any one of the detector normals as discussed later in sec .",
    "since there is no improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio by combining data from detectors beyond about 60@xmath2 , this is a convenient cutoff angle for choosing which detectors are used .",
    "furthermore , the natural timescale for which spectral measurements are most easily obtained without changing detector combinations is the observation , or pointing period , of cgro .",
    "observations , where the orientation of the lads were kept fixed with respect to celestial coordinates , lasts about two to three weeks .",
    "the specific orientation of the x and z axes , which were set by the cgro observing schedule , determined the lad combination for viewing a point on the sky .    in fig .",
    "4 , lad count spectra and model residuals are shown for four sources extracted using the method of the previous section .",
    "each frame consists of source count rates as measured via earth occultation for a set of lads whose normal vectors are less than 60@xmath2 to the respective direction of the source .",
    "all occultations of same source have been fitted to determine the _",
    "r@xmath16 _ , which are then averaged over the observation period to yield the rates ( error - weighted ) and uncertainty for each channel in each detector as shown in fig .",
    "the number of detectors per combination ranges from two ( vela x-1 ) to four ( cygnus x-1 ) .",
    "the dotted curves represent the best fitting model spectra for each lad .",
    "the fitting procedure , used commonly in high energy astronomy , is called  forward - folding \" ( briggs 1995 ) .",
    "this method avoids a potentially unstable inversion of the batse response matrices , which have large off - diagonal elements due to the lad s relatively shallow detection depth .",
    "( we will delay discussion of the lad response formalism until sec . 3.5 . )",
    "minimization of the chi - square statistic is performed using the levenberg - marquardt formulation of linear least squares ( press 1992 ) .",
    "the selected spectral model is folded through the instrument response ( pendleton 1995a ) for all detectors in the combination to determine model count spectra .",
    "the choice of an appropriate spectral model is based on trial and error , and depends on the type of source .",
    "the parameters of the model are then adjusted to minimize chi - square between the model count rates and the observed count rates for all detectors in the combination . if all fourteen energy channels are used , the number of degrees of freedom is ( # of lads ) @xmath26 14 - _ p _ , where _ p _ is the number of parameters in the model .",
    "residuals from the model fit in number of sigmas are shown below the count rate spectra for all detectors in the fit .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the corresponding multiple detector photon spectra after deconvolution of the response for the same four sources and observation periods as in fig .",
    "the solid curves represent the best fitting spectral model with parameters given in fig .",
    "5 . uncertainties in the fit parameters are obtained according to the prescription of lampton , margon & bowyer ( 1976 ) .",
    "data points in photon space and associated uncertainties ( here in photons @xmath27s@xmath25kev@xmath25 ) are derived by multiplying the spectral model by the ratio of the model counts to the observed counts . the channel boundaries and photon data points are averaged for the lads after deconvolution of the response function .",
    "representative light curves as a function of time are shown in fig .",
    "6 . for generation of light curves ,",
    "the same type of spectral fit is performed on the count spectra , usually with one or more days of occultation data , then fluxes for each point in the light curves are obtained by integrating over a specified energy range of the best fitting spectral model . in cases where the flux is not a parameter , the uncertainty in the flux is obtained either by analytically or numerically differentiating the fitting model with respect to the parameters . for generating light curves , the simpler spectral models , with one or two parameters , such as single power law or bremsstrahlung are best for the shorter energy range , whereas for longer integrations as shown in fig .",
    "5 , more sophisticated models can be used .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the treatment of statistical errors in the data shown in figs .",
    "4 - 6 are based on propagating the error from the source count rates extracted from occultation step fits to the raw data .",
    "the errors shown in the count spectra in fig . 4 come from direct error - weighted averaging of occultation step rates occurring over an observation period . in figs . 5 and 6 , even though the proper prescription of errors in the spectral fitting parameters are given , it is important to note that the  data \" in photon space are model dependent .",
    "for example , when a source is near the minimum detectable limit ( see sec .",
    "3.3 ) , and the statistical significance is low , the absolute value of the data in photon space depends heavily on the choice of spectral model .",
    "a much more desirable method of obtaining accurate fluxes and/or upper limits in a given energy band is to compare the source count rate to that of the crab nebula .",
    "error - weighted averaging across cgro pointing boundaries _",
    "after _ deconvolution of the response is a straightforward method to increase the significance of a source signal .",
    "this is desirable for cases in searching for weaker emission or longer - term variations in sources .",
    "for the light curves in fig .",
    "6 , it is simply a matter of binning the flux data into longer time bins . alternatively , it is possible to combine channel by channel data _ before _ deconvolution of the response .",
    "the fitting can then be done by retaining the total exposure to the source in each observation interval and weighting the detector response accordingly .",
    "this approach is desirable when energy spectra for weak sources ( @xmath0few mcrab ) are required ; however , systematic errors limit the ultimate flux sensitivity that can be achieved by averaging over many weeks or even years . the issue of systematic error is dealt with in later sections .",
    "we first consider the sensitivity of earth occultation without complicating factors such as nearby point sources and imperfections in the detector response function .",
    "the sensitivity of the eot with the batse lads depends on several factors .",
    "the uncollimated detector geometry of the lads and the fixed orientation of cgro with respect to the sky ( for a single pointing period ) generates continuously varying backgrounds which range over a factor of two or more .",
    "the lower energy background ( up to @xmath0100 kev ) is dominated by the modulation of the diffuse sky flux by the earth and at higher energies by the cosmic ray secondary radiation as shown in fig .",
    "thus the low energy background exhibits a slow sinusoidal variation with the orbital period of the spacecraft . at high energy ,",
    "the background is modulated more rapidly due to the changes in magnetic field strength and direction .",
    "furthermore , a given source exposes a combination of several detectors at different angles .",
    "the effective area of the lad ( the product of the geometric area and the efficiency ) is also a strong function of energy just above the lower energy threshold due to the entrance window attenuation .",
    "it decreases more slowly at higher energies from compton leakage .",
    "all these factors combine to produce complex energy and time - dependent variations in the background .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the known crab nebula flux as a standard candle to perform an empirical calculation of the sensitivity .",
    "a basic representation of the instrument sensitivity to a point source of continuum emission over a specified energy range is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the minimum detectable flux for * @xmath30 * standard deviations , _",
    "r@xmath31 _ is the background count rate , @xmath32 is the detector efficiency , @xmath33 is the geometric area of the detector , and @xmath34 is the livetime of the observation .",
    "this expression does not lend itself readily to an eot sensitivity calculation , since the background changes within the fitting window and @xmath35 is not a well - defined quantity .",
    "in addition , correction for a small rate - dependent electronic deadtime is made at that time for the cont data in counts are converted to count rates",
    ". therefore we replace @xmath36 with the uncertainty @xmath37 from the least squares fitting problem ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rterr ] ) ) , so that @xmath38 note that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : min_f2 ] ) combined with the semi - analytical expression eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rterr ] ) can be used to estimate earth occultation sensitivity for a given background rate ; however , we can use the crab nebula with known flux and measurement errors to obtain a more accurate calculation .",
    "the crab nebula flux ( @xmath39 ) can be related to the measured crab count rate @xmath40 using @xmath41 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : min_f2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : rate_crab ] ) by eliminating the area and efficiency factors yields @xmath42 we adopt a best fit broken power law for the crab nebula spectrum in photons @xmath27 s@xmath25 kev@xmath25 obtained from heao - a4 measurements ( jung 1989 ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 = 127.7 kev .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : s_crab ] ) has been used previously in evaluating the performance of batse prototype lads in balloon observations of supernova sn 1987a ( pendleton 1995b ) .",
    "the heao a-4 spectrum compares well with the observed crab nebula spectrum during the balloon flight .",
    "we can now compute the sensitivity as a function of energy , angle and detector combination , provided the source signal is adequated determined .",
    "a large body of crab nebula occultation data was obtained in all eight detectors in the 16 cont data channels at many orientations of the cgro , covering a period of about five years . these data ,",
    "as we discuss later in the context of systematic error , were parameterized so that the crab nebula source rate at any angle or energy in the lads could be determined .",
    "the parametrization therefore automatically contains the averaged exposure and background effects typical of batse data , and can be used to determine @xmath40 and @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : min_f3 ] ) .    using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : min_f3 ] ) and integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqn : s_crab ] ) over the appropriate energy range to obtain @xmath39 , we derive the point source sensitivity of a typical two week observation ( approximately the length of one cgro pointing period ) .",
    "this is shown as a function of energy and angle in figs . 7 and 8 , respectively . as the angle to the source from the detector normal increases ( fig .",
    "8) , two , three and four detector combinations in the octahedral geometry become more sensitive than a single detector as shown .",
    "table 1 compares the sensitivity of the flux extraction method and the two point source search methods discussed later .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the sensitivity in crowded sky regions such as the galactic center region is degraded from that shown in figs . 7 and 8 due to additional terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mod_rate ] ) for known interfering sources and systematic error in the flux measurements .",
    "we discuss causes of systematic error in the next section .",
    "several sources of systematic error were identified in the use of the eot to measure source fluxes .",
    "we have identified those based on location in the sky combined with orbital precession effects , unusual variations in the background , and also absolute flux using the instrument response .",
    "the treatment of systematic error varies depending on use of the data .",
    "the current method of extracting flux and spectral occultation data assumes some _ a priori _ knowledge of source intensity for sources other than the soi , i.e. , a decision is made as to what sources must be included in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mod_rate ] ) .",
    "the selection of which sources are included in the fitting window is therefore an important determiner of the systematic error in two cases : ( 1 ) where residual sharing of flux occurs between source terms in the fitting process , and ( 2 ) where sources are neglected intentionally , because of an incorrect assumption about the sources relative intensities to the soi , or unintentionally , simply because an unknown source was present in the fitting window at the time .",
    "it is important therefore to keep a controlled database of bright source information as discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "generally , sources that exceed @xmath00.02 photons @xmath27s@xmath25 in the 20 - 100 kev band ( about 75 mcrab for a source with a crab - like spectrum ) are considered as sufficiently bright to be included in the fitting window .",
    "this corresponds to about 2@xmath46 detection in one day sampling by earth occultation ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we have chosen a modest flux level that is comparable to our one - day sensitivity . setting thresholds in count space would be preferable , but this adds significantly to the computational burden .",
    "a single threshold in photon space should be regarded as a first pass method in an interative process designed to achieve best results .",
    "no account is made for the spectral differences between the soi and potentially interfering bright sources .",
    "it is possible , for example , in a reanalysis to set finer intensity thresholds or make energy - dependent cuts .",
    "the crab nebula and the black hole system cyg x-1 generally are the most persistently bright hard x - ray to low energy gamma ray sources in the sky . only occasionally do other sources , usually transients , exceed the intensity of these objects .",
    "the crab and cyg x-1 are therefore dominant contributors to systematic error in their respective sky regions when their occultation steps fall into the fitting window of the soi .",
    "an analysis of these errors can be made by examining the limb geometry as a function of time . in fig .",
    "9 we show the sky region near the crab nebula and cygnus x-1 and surrounding sources monitored by batse . in each plot ,",
    "two shaded regions are shown .",
    "those bounded by dashed curves represent the set of projections of the setting limb of the earth as the spacecraft moves through one precession cycle of its orbit .",
    "the shaded regions bounded by solid curves are the equivalent regions for the rising limb .",
    "the limb appears noncircular because of the flat sky projection .",
    "note that some regions of the sky are not swept by the earth s limb at times of occultation of the crab and cyg x-1 .",
    "for example , the gamma ray sources gro j0422 + 32 and geminga are located in sky regions that are not crossed by the projected limb of the earth at times of occultation of the crab .",
    "light curves generated for either these two sources show minimal deviation with precession phase due to the presence of crab occultation steps near in time to those of the two sources of interest . in contrast , 4u 0614 + 091 or sax j0501 + 11 , are located such that the projected setting and rising limbs of the crab , respectively , cross them at certain times during the precession cycle .",
    "this is equivalent to the crab and the two sources having occultations at essentially the same time for a period of 1 - 2 days .",
    "light curves for these two sources will exhibit significant systematic deviations in their light curves near and at these times .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "10 , where we show the time dependence of the angle between the locations of the sources ( a ) gro j0422 + 32 and ( b ) 4u 0614 + 091 , and the closest approach points of the earth s limb projection that intersect the crab nebula over a period of 200 days , or about four precession cycles .",
    "the corresponding light curves over the same time intervals are shown .",
    "gro j0422 + 32 is not detected during this time , but 4u 0614 + 091 is detected consistently , but variable ( @xmath00.01 photons @xmath27 s@xmath25 ) .",
    "the minimum angle for the setting limb of crab approaching gro j0422 + 32 is about 3@xmath2 , and therefore the occultation steps are well separated . however , for the setting limb of the crab crosses the location of 4u 0614 + 091 , and the occultations become superposed for a few days every precession cycle ( for example , around tjd 9900 ) .",
    "the corresponding light curve for 4u 0614 + 091 shows systematic deviations at these times due to residual sharing of source signal as we approach the conjunction of the setting occultation steps .",
    "our general treatment of these light curves is to reject the measurement of occultation steps of 4u 0614 + 091 that fall within 10 secs of the crab steps ( @xmath00.7@xmath2 ) .",
    "the amount of signal sharing depends on factors such as the broadness of the occultation features ( governed by the elevation angle , @xmath47 , of the source above the cgro orbital plane , see appendix b ) and the steepness of the background .",
    "sometimes a cut is made on the step measurements when the angle between the limb and the source location is less than 2@xmath2 , which unfortunately creates or increases gaps in coverage when both the rising and setting limbs have poor geometries for separating the flux from the soi from interfering sources .",
    "here we derive an average systematic error as discussed below to account for this effect .",
    "our investigation of several sources of systematic error illustrates that it is difficult to quantify the total systematic error precisely .",
    "unknown systematic errors due to source confusion are time and sky location dependent .",
    "an additional source of systematic error , discussed in the context of source step searches , is the presence of non - statistical background fluctuations ( red noise and coherent pulses ) from bright x - ray sources .",
    "we generally characterize these as backgrounds components that are , in practice , unpredictable .",
    "another source of error that we have not treated rigorously is the diffuse galactic emission along the galactic plane ( valinia & marshall 1999 ) . under appropriate limb conditions ,",
    "the diffuse component may have a sufficiently sharp profile in galactic latitude at energies in the sensitive range of batse to create occultation step - like features in the background and/or to increase the amount of cross - coupling between background and source terms in the fit . at this time",
    ", we have not tried to separate the diffuse component from possible weak point source contamination in the galactic bulge region .",
    "although the presence and structure of the ridge is scientifically interesting , modeling of this component is best done in context of a global background model , and so beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we wish , nevertheless , to estimate a total _ average _ systematic error ( source confusion + unpredictable background variations ) . to do this",
    ", we created a grid covering the galactic plane in areas where sky - dependent systematic error is a significant problem as shown in fig .",
    "the grid has points every 3@xmath2 along the galactic plane with two sets of grid points at + 6 and -6@xmath2 galactic latitude .",
    "grid points within 2@xmath2 of known bright occultation sources were excluded , yielding a total sample of 156 points .    in fig .",
    "12 , we show the average flux from each grid point averaged over a 7.2 year period and the standard deviation of one - day flux averages from the beginning of the cgro mission , in 1991 april , to 1998 july , as a function of galactic longitude , @xmath48 .",
    "the standard deviations are clearly broader than predicted for a gaussian distribution about zero flux due to systematic errors from various effects ( 1 @xmath46 = @xmath00.01 photons @xmath27s@xmath25 ) .",
    "we find broadening factors of about 30% to 60% in excess of normal statistics , strongest near the galactic center , and near bright , variable sources such as vela x-1 ( @xmath49=-96.9@xmath2 ) and cygnus x-1 ( @xmath49=71.3@xmath2 ) .",
    "there are also small positive and negative trends in the average fluxes for the 156 test points .",
    "absolute values are less than @xmath00.01 photons @xmath27s@xmath25 , with the exception of the galactic center itself . even though small , the galactic bulge region between + 60@xmath2 and -60@xmath2 shows a clear effect , presumably due to weak x - ray and gamma ray sources in greater numbers , and/or a galactic ridge component .",
    "the trends for galactic latitude are similar , but narrower in spatial extent .",
    "these results are used to estimate systematic error in the batse earth occultation catalog of low energy gamma ray sources ( harmon in preparation ) .",
    "the response matrices for the batse large area detectors have been described elsewhere ( pendleton 1995a ) , as well as their use for locating gamma ray bursts ( pendleton 1999 ) .",
    "the matrices are an ordered , discrete representation of the batse gamma - ray detectors response characteristics , and thus are used for all types of studies such as bursts , distant point sources , solar flares and atmospheric gamma ray phenomena .",
    "they are designed to convert background - subtracted source counts to incident photon spectra .",
    "the main parameters used to characterize the response is the incident photon energy , the measured detector output energy , and the angle between the detector normal and the source direction .",
    "lad prototypes were used in balloon flight observations of sn 1987a and the crab ( pendleton 1995b ) , for which an early version of the matrices eventually used for batse was developed . a monte carlo simulation was used to generate the batse lad responses based on a well - known electromagnetic cascade / transport code called egs ( ford 1978 ; 1985 ) and a mass model for the lad , its mount , and more crudely , for the remainder of the cgro spacecraft . prior to launch , the lad modules were calibrated using angular response and absolute efficiency test data taken with radioactive sources ( lestrade 1989 , 1991 ; horack 1991 ) .",
    "the monte carlo simulations were then optimized using the test data",
    ".    scattering of source radiation off the upper atmosphere can produce substantial fluxes in near earth - pointed detectors , when a point source is well above the horizon .",
    "for example , scattered radiation from an overhead gamma ray burst can contribute to the measured flux by as much as 50% ( pendleton 1999 ) .",
    "however , for earth occultation , which is near line - of - sight to the horizon for the source direction , our simulations indicate that the atmospheric scattering is negligible .",
    "therefore only the direct response matrices need be used for deconvolving fluxes as described here .",
    "in the course of our science analysis of earth occultation data , two significant systematic effects were found that could be traced to the response model : ( 1 ) the cont channel boundaries were difficult to calibrate using a simple function of energy , especially below 100 kev , due to nonlinearities in the onboard analog electronics .",
    "this created unacceptably large residuals in spectral model fits and model - dependent flux measurements , and ( 2 ) the instrument response for near face - on flux measurements was under - predicted in the model .",
    "this caused fluxes for sources near the normal direction to a lad , less than about 20@xmath2 , to be artificially high by as much as 30% .",
    "unfortunately , these two sources of systematic error were not understood prior to the launch of cgro , and corrections to the response using in - flight data were complicated due to the coupling of the two effects .",
    "preece ( 1994 ) and pendleton ( 1994 ) have used various data types to better determine the effective energies of the cont channel boundaries .",
    "each approach is different , and , although neither appears to be superior to the other , both schemes are an improvement over the pre - flight calibration ( lestrade 1991 ) , which makes no adjustments for the electronic nonlinearity . both the pendleton and preece algorithms are incorporated into the analysis of batse occultation data . for this work , all spectra and light curves were determined using the pendleton algorithm which optimizes the channel boundaries using earth occultation and pulsar data in a joint analysis ( pendleton 1994 ) .",
    "to more fully investigate the lad response as a function of photon energy and source aspect angle , i.e. , the angle between the detector normal and the source direction , the crab nebula occultation dataset for all eight detectors in the 16 cont data channels at many orientations of the cgro was used .",
    "an example of these data is shown in fig .",
    "13 for cont channel 3 ( 40 - 50 kev ) as a function of angle in lads 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "we find that the crab count rate is a smooth function of angle and highly reproducible .",
    "this is consistent with the crab nebula flux being constant to within about 5% fractional rms for the 20 - 100 kev band over the 5-year sampling period ( see fig .",
    "the dotted curve represents the modeled response of the known crab nebula flux ( eq .  ( [ eqn : s_crab ] ) ) , before ( four top frames ) and after ( four bottom frames ) , response corrections ( described below ) have been applied , and the solid curve ( same in top and bottom frames ) represents an empirical fit used to characterize the crab rates as a function of energy and angle ( laird 1996 ) . for all energy bands , and at intermediate aspect angles ( @xmath020@xmath2 - 70@xmath2 )",
    ", the agreement between data and the response model is excellent .",
    "however , in the lowest cont channels ( 1 - 3 ) , as in part ( a ) of fig .",
    "13 , the model underpredicts the actual measured crab rate as we approach the normal direction to the detector face , yielding a flat response at angles of 20@xmath2 or less , whereas the true response is more forward pointed as indicated by the data .",
    "this effect was partially attributed to the simplifying assumptions made in the lad response model for the detector entrance window .",
    "the entrance window consists of two 0.635 cm layers of a light weight aluminum - epoxy composite , called hexel , interleaved with other low z ( charge ) materials to minimize attenuation of the low energy photons .",
    "the hexel provides support and optical insulation for a plastic scintillator in front of the nai crystal for charged particle rejection .",
    "viewed from the direction of incoming photons , the hexel appears as a close - packed hexagonal array , or  honeycomb \" of cells .",
    "the cells are about 0.3 - 0.5 cm in diameter , and irregularly shaped with no alignment of cell walls between the two layers , creating a difficulty for monte carlo modeling . in the original response matrix generation ( pendleton 1995a )",
    ", the hexel is treated as uniform layers of aluminum of reduced effective thickness .    during the mission",
    ", we surmised that the entrance window allowed more flux into the detector than was predicted in the monte carlo model of the lads .",
    "the aluminum - epoxy is very thin in the direction of the normal to the detector face , but thickens faster than 1/cos@xmath50 as the angle increases , acting as a low energy collimator .",
    "we therefore performed calibration tests of an entrance window for the lads at eastern kentucky university ( eku ) ( laird 1996 ) to quantify this effect .",
    "the results revealed an energy and angular dependence due to the double hexel layer consistent with the known composition of the material .",
    "the hexel was found to account , however , for only a portion of the observed forward - angle response deficiency and only in the lowest three energy bands ( 20 - 60 kev ) .",
    "an additional detector and angular dependent effect was observed between the crab data and and model predictions over the angular range ( 0@xmath2 - 20@xmath2 ) and the entire energy range ( 20 - 2000 kev ) of the lads .",
    "we attribute the additional deficiency to the adoption of a power series in cosine of the aspect angle ( pendleton 1995 ) that was used to interpolate response matrices between the monte carlo results at a predetermined set of angles .",
    "this function ( dotted curves in part ( a ) ) is flatter in the forward direction than the crab data predict as shown in fig .",
    "a more physical function , including the triangular response of the hexel at low energies and the cosine of the geometric area ( laird 1996 ) , was used to fit the data ( solid curves in part ( a ) and ( b ) ) instead .",
    "ideally , it would be best to regenerate the response matrix model with the forward angle response properly treated , but operationally it is more convenient to consider the effects discussed above as additive , and determine an effective correction to account for the discrepancy of model and data .    using the empirical fits as shown in fig .",
    "13 as a benchmark , we derived total corrections to the response model , including both the entrance window and empirical angle corrections .",
    "the response matrix is multiplied by a factor of the form @xmath51 prior to spectral fitting . here",
    "@xmath52 represents the effective thickness of the hexel derived from the eku measurements , and @xmath53 is the energy - dependent attenuation coefficient for aluminum . the constant a is determined by matching the model and data for each detector at 0@xmath2 .",
    "the constant b , which determines the sharpness of the angular correction , was adjusted to reduce the residual difference between the dotted and solid curves in part ( a ) of fig . 13 .",
    "neither a or b are energy dependent , and b has the same value for all detectors .",
    "the corrections given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : corr_fac ] ) have been incorporated into all spectra and intensity histories presented in this paper and in the catalog of low energy gamma ray sources ( harmon in preparation ) .",
    "a histogram of the average daily crab nebula fluxes as a function of time before and after the correction is shown in fig .",
    "the histogram of flux measurements after correction is more symmetric and less - skewed toward higher fluxes .",
    "the fractional rms of the measured crab flux has dropped from about 5.2% to 4.3% in the 20 - 100 kev band .",
    "we attempt here to perform an absolute calibration of the earth occultation flux measurements using the crab nebula emission as a standard candle .",
    "we break the absolute flux determination into two parts .",
    "first , we compare earth occultation measurements of the crab nebula with lunar occultations of the same source to avoid any systematic effects due to using the earth and surrounding atmosphere as an occulting disk , and also independent of the batse response model .",
    "second , we compare observations of the crab nebula with other high energy instruments , assuming that the crab is a steady source of high energy emission .    from 1993 april to 1994 january ,",

    "we have eliminated the possibility of atmospheric scattering , and corrected systematic errors due to the response model .",
    "in fact , a normalization of our data to the osse results at 100 kev ( difference is about @xmath016% ) forces the effective area of the lad ( @xmath01700 @xmath1)to be roughly the same as its geometric area ( 2025 @xmath1 ) ! a comparison to other published instrumental results , with the exception of gris ( fig .",
    "18 ) , suggests that the osse response at lower energies ( less than about 150 kev ) is overestimated .",
    "the osse crab nebula spectrum tends to increase the change in photon spectral index from above and below the break energy ( 120 - 200 kev ) .",
    "the gris balloon - borne germanium detector also shows a breaking spectrum in this energy range , but the discrepancy of these data with batse is the largest of all instruments .",
    "again , the reason is unknown , but underscores the difficulty in precision normalization of gamma ray astronomy telescopes which typically involve complex background and detector response effects . in our batse calibration exercise",
    ", we have looked for overall consistency between the eight lads and compared the basic mechanism of occultations by the atmosphere to those by the moon .",
    "after the data selection process as described in sec .",
    "2.2 , a daily search of batse cont data was routinely performed to find occultation features of the brightest hard x - ray / gamma ray sources below the gamma ray burst trigger level .",
    "the sensitivity of the search method depends on a variety of factors such as the shape of the source spectrum , energy bandpass , the number and orientation of detectors with respect to the source used , and the behavior of the background .",
    "sources that reached levels of about 4.6@xmath2610@xmath80 erg @xmath27 s@xmath25 ( about 200 mcrab for sources with crab - like spectra ) are detectable with the step search method ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "data in each lad are first summed over the cont data channels where the best signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio for sources with crab - like spectra is obtained ( 30 - 200 kev ) .",
    "a series of fitting tests are then performed on a contiguous data segment within a fitting window of four minutes centered on a test time _",
    "t@xmath5_. we then determine if an occultation step is present in the background somewhere within the window .",
    "once a segment has been tested , positive or negative results are logged for post analysis , and the window moves or  slides \" to the next data segment . to maximize the sensitivity of the sliding search",
    ", a grid of points along the earth s limb is calculated at _",
    "t@xmath5_. using a cosine function to represent the response of the detector , the combinations of the eight lads ( out of a possible 28 ) with the best s / n ratio for each point are determined .",
    "these combinations are then tested at the corresponding limb points .",
    "the first test is a linear fit over the fitting window for each lad combination to locate deviations from a background of approximately constant slope .",
    "if the goodness of fit ( @xmath81 ) per degree of freedom is above a threshold ( usually set to @xmath821.0 ) , a second fit is performed over the same fitting window using a template step function to determine if the deviation is caused by an source occultation ( @xmath81 required for an occultation step is typically @xmath831.3 ) .",
    "a third fit is then made to estimate the best time _",
    "t@xmath5 _ of the occultation and the maximum significance of a step .",
    "the significance cutoff is set to a minimum of 2 @xmath46 to avoid large numbers of spurious step detections .",
    "the results of an occultation search for a single day are shown in fig .",
    "the significance of detected occultation steps is plotted as a lad number ( 0 - 7 ) as a function of time elapsed from the beginning of the spacecraft orbit for each orbit searched .",
    "the plotted symbol corresponds to the lad number ( 0 - 7 ) with the most significant step in the combination of detectors .",
    "the time zero is the time of the first data packet for the day .",
    "plotted in this way , detected steps from the same source cluster at a specific time , although a shift of a few seconds occurs in the occultation time folded on the orbital period due to the orbital precession , which is about 0.5@xmath2 per orbit .",
    "the times of bright source occultations , such as those for the crab and cygnus x-1 , are shown on the plot .",
    "significances above zero and below zero indicate rising steps and setting steps , respectively .",
    "this method allows a quick determination of occultation times of bright transient or flaring sources from which the location of a source can be deduced from the orientation of the earth s limb at rise and set . in appendices b and c",
    "we describe a graphical method for localizing a point source based on the time of occultation steps .",
    "the single step search / graphical method for determining source locations was used primarily in the early part of cgro mission , prior to 1993 , after which we developed earth occultation imaging to improve our ability for source localization .",
    "two effects severely limited the sensitivity of the single step search .",
    "in the first place , orbit to orbit variations in the background make it impractical to combine raw data for different orbits .",
    "a change in the background of a few percent from one orbit to the next can induce features in the background that mimic occultation steps . without a reliable predictor of the background or a de - trending algorithm , orbit by orbit data",
    "can not be folded to increase the sensitivity ( this is overcome in the imaging technique discussed in the next section ) .",
    "the second problem is the presence of sub - threshold transient features that escape the manual flagging procedure or are impractical to flag .",
    "an example is the presence of bright long - period ( p@xmath0minutes ) pulsar signals in the background data .",
    "pulses from sources such as vela x-1 , gx 301 - 2 or other bright high mass binary transient systems are a source of nonstatistical noise .",
    "this problem was partially overcome by increasing the length of the fitting window and the bandpass for the search , at the expense of sensitivity to softer spectrum sources .    in general , the accuracy of the eot for determining a source s sky position depends very strongly on the orientation of the earth s limb at the time of detection . if the rising and setting limbs are nearly parallel , which is true when the source direction is very close to the orbital plane of the spacecraft , it is obvious the positional accuracy along the limb direction can be very poor .",
    "on the other hand , allowing orbital precession to move the limb geometry into a more favorable configuration , can greatly improve positional accuracy .",
    "in a situation of optimal limb geometry , the width of the occultation feature itself and the s / n ratio limits the ultimate positional accuracy . the spatial resolution perpendicular to the limb",
    "is determined by the width of the occultation step in time , which takes about 8/cos @xmath47 seconds , where @xmath47 is the angle of the source with respect to the orbital plane ( see appendix b ) .",
    "for a 90 minute orbit , the angular resolution on the sky is ( 8s/5400s)*360@xmath2 , or @xmath0 0.5@xmath2 .",
    "table i gives a lower limit on the positional error , considering these factors .",
    "for the step search method , the best obtainable accuracy was @xmath01@xmath2 with a simple step function consisting of a fitted line for the background and a steeper line with a step width of 10 seconds .",
    "we were able to improve our locational accuracy to @xmath00.2@xmath2 by comparing the step search results to the predicted shape of the earth occultation features from the atmospheric attenuation model ( sec .",
    "usually a few iterations on the source location were required to achieve the best agreement with the data that were available at that time .",
    "examples of the use of this method are given in harmon ( 1992 ) , paciesas ( 1992 ) and harmon ( 1993 ) , for the sources 4u 1543 - 47 ( 0.25@xmath2 ) , gro j0422 + 32 ( 0.68@xmath2 ) , and gro j1719 - 24 ( = grs 1716 - 249 ) ( 0.14@xmath2 ) , respectively , where the number in parenthesis is the difference in degrees between the reported batse location and that of the optical counterpart from the electronic database simbad .",
    "occultation features in the time domain can be transformed into spatial information for construction of images .",
    "this enhanced the ability of batse to locate and identify much weaker sources than the step search algorithm permitted , and considerably increased the effectiveness of the instrument as an all - sky monitor ( zhang 1993 , 1994a ) .",
    "it also allowed us to obtain positional information more efficiently and easily for new transient sources and to discriminate between sources in crowded regions such as the galactic center .",
    "occultation transform imaging is conceptually similar to techniques used for many years in radio astronomy ( bracewell 1956 ) and medical x - ray tomography ( gullberg & tsui 1989 ) to convert essentially one - dimensional scanning measurements into two - dimensional images . using the earth as a stable occulting disk ,",
    "the limb is projected onto the sky .",
    "as the limb of the earth ( an arc , not a straight line ) sweeps through a chosen region of the sky , the lads record the counting rate as a function of time .",
    "the location of the spacecraft is well - known and thus the location and orientation of the limb projected on the sky can be determined accurately . for point sources along the limb ,",
    "a change occurs in the detector counting rate as shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "for a single location on the sky , the intersecting earth s limb will change its angle due to precession of the spacecraft orbit .",
    "if enough one - dimensional strips are sampled , an image can be generated .",
    "image reconstruction is achieved via the radon transformation ( deans 1983 ) and the maximum entropy method ( huesman 1977 ) .",
    "use of the radon transformation to represent the limb projection limits sky images to a field - of - view ( fov ) of about 20@xmath2 by 20@xmath2 .",
    "larger images produce distortion of point source locations near the edges of the fov .",
    "we begin with a forward transform from the image space ( sky pixels ) to the data space ( count rate vs. time ) , which is accomplished in two steps .",
    "first , a curved radon transform is applied ( deans 1983 ) for the defined fov .",
    "this is performed numerically since no analytic form is available to describe the limb arc on the sky . in the second step , a high pass butterworth filter from the radon space to the data space",
    "is executed using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "the butterworth filter was chosen over a differential filter ( zhang 1995 ) used in a first generation of the imaging system ( zhang 1993 ) since it gives a better s / n ratio , 80% vs. 50% , and was also less sensitive to spikes in the background data .",
    "the data are then filtered with the same algorithm , however , the data ( discla ) usually contain gaps due to flagging of fast timescale variations in the background , saa passages or loss of telemetry .",
    "the best method we have found to fill data gaps is to make a simple linear interpolation .",
    "the result is a flattened data residual with bi - polar shaped features of finite width for point source occultations with the slowly - varying background components removed ( paciesas 1995 ) .",
    "finally , the data space to image space reconstruction is performed using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) ( gull & skilling 1984 ) .",
    "the backward transform is physically a smearing of the original image with the forward transform function , and thus defines the direction in which the iterative process converges .",
    "the maximum entropy principle is used as a stopping criteria since an exact reconstruction is not achievable due to the presence of noise and imperfect sampling forced by the available limb projections .",
    "monte carlo simulations have been performed to confirm the reliability and sensitivity of the images ( zhang 1995 ) . a simulated image and occultation data ( after filtering ) for two closely - spaced point sources using data which contain rises and sets separated by two days",
    "is shown in fig . 20 .",
    "examples of images are shown in fig .",
    "21 for sources along the galactic plane .",
    "the location accuracy near the center of a 10@xmath2 @xmath26 10@xmath2 image is @xmath840.3@xmath2 for a best case geometry ( nearly perpendicular limb samplings ) , with a sensitivity in the 20 - 100 kev range of about @xmath01.1@xmath2610@xmath80 erg @xmath27 s@xmath25 ( 75 mcrab for a source with a crab - like spectrum ) for a one day integration .",
    "computer memory requirements limit the number of days that can be combined into one image , although we have achieved integrations of 15 - 20 days , with a sensitivity between 10 and 20 mcrab . for locating a new source , generating an image such that a source is near the center of the fov , produces a sensitivity and positional accuracy that is close to the standard flux extraction method ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the chief advantage of imaging method is that it requires less _ a priori _ knowledge of a new source location and the details of orbital precession and the presence of interfering sources are naturally taken into account .",
    "thus the method allowed deep imaging of short - lived transients ( a few days ) , and identification of weak high energy emission from low mass x - ray binaries ( barret 1996 ) , active galaxies ( malizia 2000 ) and supernova remnants ( mccollough 1997 )",

    "we have shown various aspects of the earth occultation technique for point source studies with the batse large area detectors .",
    "the technique is applicable to all - sky monitoring or obtaining time- and energy - dependent information about hard x - ray and low energy gamma ray sources , and yields positional information for point sources with moderate accuracy .",
    "it has been used successfully for several years for independent science investigations and triggering observations with other satellites and ground - based instruments .",
    "the method can be used with an uncollimated detector and without sophisticated background models .",
    "improved background modeling , however , would allow one to increase the amount of data within the fitting window and abandon the simple polynomial fits , thus potentially increasing the sensitivity of the method .",
    "several efforts have resulted in models that can predict backgrounds to the few percent level ( ling 1996 ; rubin 1996b ) , but in practice , extracting point source fluxes in the few mcrab range using batse requires sub - percent level accuracy .",

    "<S> an earth orbiting detector sensitive to gamma ray photons will see step - like occultation features in its counting rate when a gamma ray point source crosses the earth s limb . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the change in atmospheric attenuation of the gamma rays along the line of sight . in an uncollimated detector , </S>",
    "<S> these occultation features can be used to locate and monitor astrophysical sources provided their signals can be individually separated from the detector background . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the _ earth occultation technique _ applied to the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ </S>",
    "<S> ( cgro ) is a viable and flexible all - sky monitor in the low energy gamma ray and hard x - ray energy range ( 20 kev - 1 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the method is an alternative to more sophisticated photon imaging devices for astronomy , and can serve well as a cost - effective science capability for monitoring the high energy sky .    </S>",
    "<S> here we describe the earth occultation technique for locating new sources and for measuring source intensity and spectra without the use of complex background models . </S>",
    "<S> examples of transform imaging , step searches , spectra , and light curves are presented . </S>",
    "<S> systematic uncertainties due to source confusion , detector response , and contamination from rapid background fluctuations are discussed and analyzed for their effect on intensity measurements . </S>",
    "<S> a sky location - dependent average systematic error is derived as a function of galactic coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the technique is derived as a function of incident photon energy and also as a function of angle between the source and the normal to the detector entrance window . </S>",
    "<S> occultations of the crab nebula by the moon are used to calibrate earth occultation flux measurements independent of possible atmospheric scattering effects .    </S>",
