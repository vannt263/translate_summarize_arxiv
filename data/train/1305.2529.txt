    "the disappearance of @xmath4 shell closures has been a huge debate in recent years , especially after the conflicting experimental evidence on the structure of @xmath2si coming from msu  @xcite and ganil  @xcite .",
    "the small two - proton removal cross section in the first experiment was interpreted as a doubly closed - shell structure with a large @xmath5 subshell gap at @xmath4 , indicating a nearly spherical shape of this nucleus .",
    "contrary to this result , the observation of a very low - lying @xmath6 state at ganil supports the vanishing of the @xmath4 shell closure and a largely - deformed shape for @xmath2si .",
    "the later claim actually has been theoretically pointed out in several studies with shell - model and mean - field approaches  @xcite .",
    "these studies predict the spherical neutron shell closure is broken already in the mean - field level  @xcite , and the shape coexistence is present in some nuclei along the @xmath4 isotone , due to a soft energy surface  @xcite .",
    "some articles have also considered the possible influence of the @xmath7-softness found in the neutron - rich si region  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , comparisons were made among the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) approach , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model , and the finite - range droplet model ( frdm ) for the quadruple deformation of si isotopes .",
    "these models gave consistent ground - state shape predictions for @xmath8si ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10si ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath2si ( @xmath12 ) : oblate for @xmath13si and spherical for @xmath10si .",
    "the non - magic nature of @xmath2si was noted then as an interesting phenomenon .",
    "the reason for this is attributed recently to the tensor effect on the change of shell structure in neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this tensor interaction acts directly on the @xmath14 spin - orbit splitting , and gives a smaller @xmath15-@xmath16 proton gap when more neutrons occupy @xmath17 orbit .",
    "this feature is later analyzed in details by tarpanov et al .",
    "@xcite within various mean - field models assuming the spherical symmetry .",
    "they have demonstrated that the tensor component in the effective interaction governs the reduction of the @xmath14 proton spin - orbit splitting when going from @xmath10si to @xmath2si .",
    "also the magnitude of the change is consistent with the empirical observations .",
    "it is necessary to extend the study of tensor correlations not only for the spin - orbit splitting but also for the evolution of deformed nuclei as will be done in the present work .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of tensor terms in the calculations have achieved considerable success in explaining several nuclear structure problems not only in the ground states  @xcite but also in the excited states  @xcite . in the present study we focus on the tensor effect on the shape evolution of si isotopes , for example : is the tensor - force - driven deformation present in other neutron - rich si isotopes , especially @xmath18si with a possible @xmath19 subshell , since some models ( for example , the frdm  @xcite ) predicted a spherical for this nucleus  @xcite while the large @xmath20 value suggested its deformed nature  @xcite .    for this purpose",
    ", we use the deformed skyrme - hartree - fock model ( dshf )  @xcite with bcs approximation for the nucleon pairing . as well - known",
    ", the standard bcs treatment of pairing was criticized to have the unphysical particle - gas problem  @xcite when applied to neutron - rich isotopes , namely , there is an unrealistic pairing of highly excited states . to cure this defect to some extent , a smooth energy - dependent cut - off weight was introduced  @xcite in the evaluation of the local pair density , to confine the region of the influence of the pairing potential to the vicinity of the fermi surface",
    "some work also tried a variant calculation with weak pairing  @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "the above - mentioned cut - off weight is incorporated in the bcs approximation , and for each nucleus the pairing parameter is obtained with full respect of the empirical data of pairing gaps , extracted by using the experimental binding energies of ref .",

    "the predicted oblate shape of this nuclei is consistent with the recent rmf result  @xcite .",
    "one should note that the same gap data have been used to deduce the pairing parameters for the different skyrme interactions , and the variation of pairing parameters is only aimed to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "the interesting performance of a weak nucleon pairing may stem from a well - known fact that the pairing interaction forms the @xmath48 pairs of identical particles which have spherically symmetric wave functions , and as a result , nuclei tend to be more spherical in the cases of t22 and t44 with stronger pairing couplings .",
    "this suggests that the resulting shape of a nucleus is sensitive to the nuclear pairing in each nucleus  @xcite , and the experimentally - determined deformed shape of @xmath18si favors relatively weak paring correlations present in the skyrme effective force t24 , t64 and t66 .",

    "it is clearly shown that the oblate shape of @xmath2si is quite robust for different tensor couplings , which justifies the broken of @xmath4 shell closure seen in a simple single - particle ( s. p. ) shell - model picture .",

    "experimentally the sign of deformation will be determined by the measurement of its quadrupole moment , and we do not draw any conclusion about this in the present work .",
    "one more interesting feature is the deformation change from @xmath1si to @xmath2si with the increase of neutron number : the energy minima move from the prolate side in the lighter nucleus @xmath1si to the oblate side in the heavier nucleus @xmath2si .",
    "we should notice that this feature of shape evolution will always appear in the present model , despite the employed skyrme effective force .",

    "two main features can be seen as the tensor effect to compare the results between t22 and t66 for @xmath18si : a narrower @xmath54-@xmath16 gap and a steeper @xmath16 orbits downward in the oblate side .",
    "then , in the case of t66 , more mixing between @xmath54 and @xmath16 results in an oblate shape for this nuclei in comparison with the case of t22 .",

    "[ fig6 ] the evolution of the quadruple deformations @xmath44 with mass number @xmath23 along the silicon isotopic chain for various effective interactions , in comparison with the relativistic - hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) results  @xcite .",

    "all parametrizations in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] predict an oblate shape for @xmath55si , a spherical shape for @xmath56si , and a prolate shape for @xmath1si .",
    "the spherical shape of @xmath10si is expected because of the neutron closed shell @xmath57 .",
    "the same spherical shape might be also expected in @xmath58si because two neutrons outside of the @xmath57 closed shell is not enough to make a deformation .",
    "however , the tensor force has a large effect in nuclei @xmath3si deepening the energy surfaces at oblate energy minima in these nuclei .",

    "we found a manifestation of tensor correlations in several isotopic nuclei , such as @xmath3si , in competition with the pairing correlations .",
    "generally , the tensor force helps to achieve a well - deformed local minimum , by reducing the shell gaps and enhancing s. p. level densities near the fermi level . in our calculations ,",
    "the effect of tensor force emerges evidently when we compare the calculated shapes of @xmath43si with increasing tensor terms in the employed hf energy density .",
    "large tensor correlations result in a larger deformation for this nuclei , in comparison with a spherical result with small tensor forces .",
    "the tensor - force - driven deformation in this nuclei is something we should pay much attention to , since it relates to a further improvement of many theoretical models or parametrizations , such as shell model and the shf model , toward a better description for the shell structures of nuclei in general . on the other hand ,",
    "the pairing interaction among nucleons is introduced in this work using the bcs treatment .",
    "we take the strength parameters fully consistent with the empirical gap data . for the chosen various skyrme parametrizations",
    ", we find that the resulting pairing strengths are not so much varied around the average value around @xmath40 = 900 @xmath41 1000 mev @xmath42 .",
    "however , the resulting nuclear shapes are sensitive to the adapted pairing strengths . that is , to take @xmath18si as an example , t22 and t44 with the larger values around 1000 mev @xmath42 , give no deformation , while t24 , t64 , and t66 with the smaller values around 800 mev @xmath42 give a large oblate deformation .",
    "we notice that the latter case is preferred by the recent experiments .",
    "this means the skyrme interactions t24 , t64 , t66 give a better description of @xmath18si . finally ,",
    "all the listed effective forces in this work show a prolate - to - oblate transition with increasing number of neutrons from @xmath1si to @xmath2si as a typical jahn - teller effect . to further disentangle the prolate or oblate nature of @xmath53si , the coulomb excitation could be the best experimental tool to find out the sign and the magnitude of the quadrupole deformation .",
    "the measurements of quadruple moments of its neighboring nuclei ( such as @xmath59si or @xmath60si ) can also give important information on the evolution of the deformation near @xmath53si .",
