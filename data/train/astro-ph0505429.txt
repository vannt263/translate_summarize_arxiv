    "for at least the past two decades , astronomers have believed that dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies ( not to be confused with dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which typically have absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath2 mag ) are distinct objects from the more luminous ( ordinary ) elliptical ( e ) galaxies .",
    "the divide between these allegedly different classes is supposed to occur at an absolute magnitude of @xmath3 mag ( e.g. , kormendy 1985 ) .    in this talk",
    "i will review the most oftenly quoted reasons why the des are thought to be different from the es , and then go on to explain why i think these past claims for a discontinuity at @xmath3 mag should be reconsidered .",
    "i will argue that a continuity in structural properties exists across this alleged boundary .",
    "much , but not all , of this talk is based on sections 1 and 4 from graham & guzmn ( 2003 ) , where further details may be found .",
    "before addressing the issue of galaxy structure , which is where past claims of discontinuity have their roots , it is relevant to review various other physical aspects of the de and e population .",
    "several physical quantities vary smoothly across the alleged division at @xmath418 @xmath5mag .",
    "the average globular cluster metallicity is known to vary continuously , as a function of host galaxy magnitude , across the alleged de / e divide ( e.g. , forbes et al .",
    "1996 , their figure 14 ) .",
    "ct ( 2005 , these proceedings ) has shown how this arises from a systematic variation in the relative numbers of red and blue globular clusters , as opposed to a single population changing its mean metallicity .",
    "furthermore , the host galaxies themselves follow a luminosity  metallicity relation that shows no sign of a division or break at @xmath3 mag ( e.g. , caldwell & bothun 1987 ) .",
    "related to this , the colour  magnitude relation shows no sign of a division at @xmath3 mag ( e.g. , caldwell 1983 ) .",
    "now , on average , des do have a different metallicity from the brighter es , but the key point is that there is a continuous change in chemical composition between the two . if one was to measure the average height and weight of a sample of adults , and then do the same for a sample of children , one would of course conclude that these populations have different physical properties . but",
    "this obviously tells us little as to whether or not children are the same specie as adults . aside from the stellar populations not knowing about the supposed de / e transition",
    ", there is also no dynamical evidence . including dozens of des , matkovi & guzmn ( 2005 , and also these proceedings ) and de rijcke et al .",
    "( 2005 , see also these proceedings ) have both shown that the luminosity  velocity dispersion ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) relation continues linearly across the alleged boundary between the des and es .",
    "interestingly , both studies found that the slope of this relation is @xmath82 , jumping to @xmath84 and thus recovering the faber ",
    "jackson ( 1976 ) relation at magnitudes greater than @xmath9 @xmath5mag .",
    "what then , are the popular reasons which have led people to believe that the des form a uniquely different class of object to the es ?",
    "this section lists the three most often quoted reasons why dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies are thought to be different species of object .",
    "the reasons pertain to galaxy structure . in the light of new data , however , the following section will explain why these three arguments are no longer valid .",
    "the following section will also counter two further claims of support for a de / e discontinuity at @xmath3 mag .    _",
    "( i ) _ dwarf elliptical galaxies have exponential light  profiles ( faber & lin 1983 ; binggeli , sandage & tarenghi 1984 ) , while elliptical galaxies have @xmath10 profiles ( de vaucouleurs 1948 , 1959 ; de vaucouleurs & capaccioli 1979 ) .    _ ( ii ) _ dwarf elliptical galaxies define a distribution that is almost at right angles to that traced by the brighter elliptical galaxies in the diagram of central surface brightness , @xmath11 , versus absolute magnitude , @xmath12 , ( kormendy 1985 , his figure 3 ) .",
    "such behaviour has been taken as evidence that different formation processes must have shaped the des and the es .",
    "the divide is said to occur at an absolute magnitude of @xmath418 @xmath5mag .    _",
    "( iii ) _ in diagrams which plot a galaxy s effective surface brightness , @xmath13 , dwarf elliptical galaxies follow a distribution that is clearly offset to that defined by the brighter elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath12@xmath13 and @xmath14@xmath13 diagram ( capaccioli , caon & donofrio 1992 , their figure 4 ; binggeli & ferguson 1994 ; their section 2.2.2 ) , and also for the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) when constructed using effective surface brightnesses ( e.g. , geha , guhathakurta & van der marel 2002 ) .",
    "in the author s opinion , there have been two key advances since the above three observations were established .",
    "the first has come from a closer scrutiny of optical light",
    " profiles .",
    "studies such as those by schombert ( 1986 ) revealed that the @xmath10law was not as universal as previously thought .",
    "similarly , analyses by caldwell & bothun ( 1987 ) and binggeli & cameron ( 1991 ) revealed that the des have magnitude  dependent departures from the exponential model .",
    "the subsequent use of high  quality ccd imagery no doubt helped to refine this picture .",
    "second , the superb resolution provided by the hubble space telescope has allowed us to probe the centers of galaxies on scales previously washed out by atmospheric seeing .",
    "the impact of these two things on the above three points is given below .    _",
    "( i ) _ there is no question that de vaucouleurs @xmath10 model fits many elliptical galaxies remarkably well .",
    "it is a clever and useful empirical function . however , as noted in djorgovski & kormendy ( 1989 ) , it fits best elliptical galaxies with @xmath15 mag ; brighter and fainter galaxies having different curvature than described by the @xmath10 model .",
    "thanks to the pioneering work of capaccioli and collaborators , most notably caon , capaccioli & donofrio ( 1993 ) , numerous studies have now shown that srsic s ( 1963 , 1968 ) @xmath16 generalisation accommodates for the real ( trujillo , graham & caon 2001 ; their section 2 ) and systematic changes in light  profile shape @xmath17 with absolute magnitude ( e.g. , donofrio , capaccioli , & caon 1994 ; graham et al .",
    "1996 ; vennik et al .",
    "similarly , the stellar distribution in dwarf elliptical galaxies is also a function of absolute magnitude ( e.g. , davies et al .",
    "1988 ; cellone , forte , & geisler 1994 ; vennik & richter 1994 ; young & currie 1994 , 1995 ; karachentseva et al .",
    "1996 ; jerjen & binggeli 1997 ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig_m - n ] using a heterogeneous sample of literature data .",
    "presumably the actual level of scatter is less than seen here .",
    "one may alternatively plot concentration , rather than profile shape , as done in graham , trujillo & caon ( 2001 ) .",
    "band galaxy magnitude versus the logarithm of the srsic shape index @xmath17 . due to biasing from the magnitude cutoff at @xmath18 mag , the line",
    "@xmath19 has been estimated by eye .",
    "dots represent de galaxies from binggeli & jerjen ( 1998 ) , triangles are de galaxies from stiavelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , large stars are de galaxies from graham & guzmn ( 2003 ) , asterix are intermediate to bright e galaxies from caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and donofrio et al .",
    "lenticular galaxies have been excluded .",
    ", height=453 ]    _ ( ii ) _ using _ hst _ data from the nuker team ( faber et al.1997 ) , the @xmath12@xmath11 relation is now much better defined than it was twenty years ago , especially at the bright end .",
    "furthermore , the increased number of galaxies around the alleged transition magnitude of @xmath418 @xmath5mag has also improved our understanding of what is going on .",
    "what is immediately clear from figure  [ fig_m - mu0 ] is that there is no break at @xmath3 mag .",
    "instead , a linear trend exists across this supposed divide , and extends from @xmath2 mag to @xmath20 mag .",
    "this diagram does not imply that the des ( @xmath21 mag ) experienced a different formation process to the es .",
    "the behaviour of the elliptical galaxies in figure  [ fig_m - mu0 ] is similar to that seen in the @xmath6@xmath7 diagram , in which galaxies more luminous than @xmath0 mag depart from the linear distribution defined by the less luminous es and des ( see matkovi & guzmn 2005 , these proceedings , their figure 1 ) .",
    "the deviant galaxies at the high  luminosity end in figure  [ fig_m - mu0 ] have all been identified by the nuker team as `` core '' galaxies : their central light  profiles display a clear break and downward flattening relative to the inward extrapolation of their outer ( srsic ) stellar distribution ( graham et al .",
    "2003 ; trujillo et al .",
    "such `` core '' galaxies may have formed from the dissipationless merger of two or more lesser es , in which the progenitor galaxy s supermassive black holes have coalesced at the center of the new galaxy via the gravitational slingshot , and thus evacuation , of the central stars ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ; ebisuzaki , makino , & okumura 1991 ) .",
    "this local , rather than global , physical process , reduces the central flux by @xmath80.1% of the total galaxy flux ( graham 2004 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the central surface brightness one would obtain from the inward extrapolation of the undisturbed outer light ",
    "profile of the `` core '' galaxies yields values that fall on the linear relation shown in figure  [ fig_m - mu0 ] ( jerjen & binggeli 1997 ) .",
    "mag , the line @xmath22 has been estimated by eye rather than from a linear regression routine .",
    "the central surface brightness values obtained from srsic models fitted to luminous ( @xmath23 mag ) e galaxies follow this same relation ( jerjen & binggeli 1997 ) , although they were not used to define it .",
    "the symbols are the same as in figure  [ fig_m - n ] , with the additional open circles representing the so  called `` power  law '' e galaxies from faber et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and the filled circles representing the `` core '' e galaxies from these same authors .",
    ", width=453 ]    _ ( iii ) _ the difference between the central surface brightness , @xmath11 , and the effective surface brightness , @xmath13 ( the surface brightness at the effective half  light radius @xmath14 ) , is the same for every @xmath10 profile .",
    "this difference , however , varies as a function of profile shape @xmath17 , and is given by the expression @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "so , as the galaxy magnitudes brighten in figure  [ fig_m - mu0 ] , the value of @xmath17 increases ( figure  [ fig_m - n ] ) and thus the value of @xmath26 increases .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ m_mue]b .",
    "related to this , the mean surface brightness within the effective radius , @xmath27 , can be derived from the expression @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 is the gamma function ( e.g. , graham & driver 2005 ) .",
    "the different slopes for the de and e galaxy distributions in figure  [ m_mue ] is merely a consequence of a continuously varying profile shape with galaxy luminosity , it does not imply distinctly different galaxy formation processes for des and es .     and [ fig_m - mu0 ] .",
    "the straight line shown here is from figure  [ fig_m - mu0 ] .",
    ", width=238 ]      _ ( a ) _ kormendy ( 2004 ) has claimed that the decline in the de galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes , and the associated decline in the e galaxy luminosity function at faint magnitudes is evidence that they are distinct populations .",
    "this argument of course falls down if one assigns a galaxy to the de or e population based on its luminosity .",
    "similarly , if one assigns an object to a class based on its appearance ( i.e. , using image concentration or light ",
    "profile shape ) , the situation remains unchanged ( see figure  [ fig_m - n ] ) .",
    "figure  [ cmon ] shows the luminosity function of the virgo de @xmath30 e galaxies .",
    "there is obviously nothing special about @xmath3 mag , and certainly no evidence for a deficit of galaxies at this magnitude , nor is it the overlap region of two distributions peaking at fainter and brighter magnitudes .",
    "e galaxy luminosity function .",
    "there is no evidence for a division at @xmath3118 mag .",
    "likely ( 50% chance ) cluster members are weighted by 0.5 .",
    "figure courtesy of h.  jerjen .",
    ", height=302 ]    _ ( b ) _ from the beginning it has been known that galaxies with central velocity dispersions less than about 100 km s@xmath32 do not follow the `` fundamental plane '' ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) as defined by luminous elliptical galaxies .    using @xmath33",
    ", it can be shown that the same mechanism that causes the curved relations in figure  [ m_mue ] is also behind the different slopes in the @xmath27@xmath34 and @xmath35 diagram for the des and es .",
    "it therefore comes as no surprise that the des are not distributed on the fundamental plane .",
    "as was noted in graham & guzmn ( 2004 ) , the fundamental plane is simply the tangent sheet to the high  luminosity end of a curved surface in the three  space of @xmath36 and @xmath7 .",
    "only bright es that follow the kormendy ( 1977 ) relation ( see capaccioli et al .",
    "1992 , their figure 4 ) will reside on typical constructions of the fundamental plane .",
    "the use of central surface brightness mitigates the apparent different behaviour of the des and es ( guzmn et al .",
    "2005 , in prep ) .",
    "chemically and dynamically , the des appear to form a continuous extension with the es .",
    "both the colour  magnitude relation ( but see lisker et al .",
    ", these proceedings ) and the @xmath6@xmath7 relation show a continuous linear trend across the alleged boundary at @xmath418 @xmath5mag .",
    "similarly , the de @xmath30 e galaxy luminosity function shows no evidence of a divide at this magnitude .    in terms of galaxy structure ,",
    "des and es display a continuous range of properties that vary smoothly across the alleged de / e divide .",
    "the shape of their ( projected ) stellar distribution , quantified through srsic s index @xmath17 , increases steadily with luminosity from values around 0.5 for the fainter dwarfs , to values greater than 4 for the more luminous ellipticals .",
    "the central ( host galaxy ) surface brightness brightens linearly ( from @xmath37 mag ) as the host galaxy magnitude brightens .",
    "there is no discontinuity at @xmath3 mag in the @xmath12@xmath11 diagram .",
    "the above two relations account for the near  orthogonal distribution of des and es in diagrams of effective surface brightness versus ( i ) magnitude and ( ii ) effective radius .",
    "they also explain why the des depart from the es in the traditional construction of the fundamental plane , which uses effective surface brightness .",
    "we report a clear break in the @xmath12@xmath11 relation at @xmath20 mag , such that more luminous galaxies have fainter central surface brightnesses .",
    "thanks to the resolution of _ hst _ , this departure of the brightest elliptical galaxies from the main @xmath12@xmath11 relation is understood to be associated with the presence of partially depleted cores .",
    "i wish to thank my collaborators rafael guzmn , ana matkovi and ileana vass who have contributed to various aspects of this paper .",
