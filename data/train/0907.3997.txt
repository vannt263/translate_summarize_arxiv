    "in the last years a number of exciting discoveries of new hadron states have challenged our description of the hadron spectroscopy .",
    "one of the most mysterious states is the well established @xmath6 .",
    "it was first discovered by the belle collaboration in the @xmath12 invariant mass spectrum of the decay @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "its existence was soon confirmed by babar  @xcite , cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the world average mass is @xmath14 and its width @xmath15 .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath16 decay  @xcite implies an even @xmath17-parity .",
    "moreover angular correlation between final state particles in the @xmath18 decay measured by belle  @xcite suggests that the @xmath19 and @xmath20 may be ruled out and strongly favors the @xmath21 quantum numbers although the @xmath22 combination can not be excluded .",
    "a later analysis by cdf collaboration  @xcite of the same decay is compatible with the belle results and concludes from the dipion mass spectrum that the most likely quantum numbers should be @xmath21 but can not totally exclude the @xmath23 combination .",
    "these conclusions were confirmed by a new cdf analysis of the decay @xmath24 followed by @xmath25 excluding all the other possible quantum numbers at @xmath26 confidence level  @xcite .",
    "however the small phase space available for the decay @xmath27 observed by belle  @xcite discards the @xmath28 leaving the @xmath0 assignment as the most probable option .    in the @xmath0 sector",
    "the only well established state in the pdg  @xcite is the @xmath29 with a mass @xmath30 .",
    "the first excitation is expected around @xmath31 . in this energy region belle",
    "has reported the observation of three resonant structures denoted by @xmath9 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the last one was observed by belle in the @xmath34 reaction  @xcite and is already included in the pdg as the @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath9 has been seen as a peak in the recoiling mass spectrum of @xmath36 produced in @xmath37 collision .",
    "its main decay channel is @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 appears as a threshold enhancement in the @xmath38 invariant mass distribution of the @xmath39 decay  @xcite .",
    "the relative decay rates outlines a puzzling structure for the @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 decay rates  @xcite @xmath42 suggest a @xmath1 structure whereas the @xmath43 decay mode @xmath44 indicates a very different one  @xcite .",
    "the dipion mass spectrum in the @xmath45 channel shows that the pions come from the @xmath46 resonance . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath47 mass spectrum has a strong peak around @xmath48 suggesting that the process is dominated by a @xmath49 meson .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath50 indicates that there should be an isospin violation incompatible with a traditional charmonium assumption .    concerning the mass value , in 2006 belle measured  @xcite an enhancement in the @xmath51 channel just above the @xmath52 threshold using the @xmath53 decay .",
    "the amazing aspect of this enhancement is that it appears at @xmath54 just @xmath55 above the @xmath56 world average mass value .",
    "this fact triggered a new discussion about the possibility of two different charmonium like states .",
    "the belle mass value was confirmed later by the babar collaboration  @xcite .",
    "last year the belle collaboration announced a new measurement of the @xmath57 decay  @xcite with a lower position of the @xmath6 peak in @xmath58 .",
    "new data of the @xmath59 decay has been also recently reported by the belle  @xcite , babar  @xcite and cdf  @xcite collaborations , confirming a mass value in agreement with the world average .",
    "the @xmath6 mass is difficult to reproduce by the standard quark models ( see ref .  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the state appears to be too heavy for a @xmath60 charmonium state and too light for a @xmath61 charmonium one .",
    "moreover no four - quark bound state configurations have been found in this mass region which rules out the possibility that this particle was a compact tetraquark system  @xcite .",
    "an important property of the @xmath6 is that its mass is extremely close to the @xmath7 threshold with a difference using pdg values given by @xmath62 .",
    "the proximity of the @xmath63 threshold made the @xmath6 a natural candidate to a @xmath64 @xmath63 molecule .",
    "the hypothesis of a @xmath3 molecule mainly bound by pion exchange has been suggested by several authors  @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that the @xmath6 is a @xmath21 @xmath63 molecule stabilized by admixture of @xmath65 and @xmath66 states .",
    "the author shows that pion exchange alone can not bind the molecule being the combined effect of pion exchange and coupled channels responsible for that .",
    "the @xmath7 component dominates the wave function at the experimental binding becoming all other contributions small .",
    "the molecular interpretation runs into trouble when it tries to explain the high @xmath41 decay rate . for a molecular state",
    "this can be only proceed through annihilation diagrams and hence is very small .",
    "this puzzling situation suggests for the @xmath6 state a combination of a @xmath61 @xmath1 state and a weakly - bound @xmath63 molecule  @xcite .",
    "the experimental assignment @xmath21 favors this conclusion because it allows the molecule to be in a relative @xmath67-wave state whereas the corresponding @xmath1 should be in a relative @xmath68-wave state .",
    "then the masses of the additional light quarks are compensated by the angular momentum excitation and both configurations may be almost in the same mass region .",
    "similar behavior has been already observed in the open charmed sector  @xcite . recently",
    "zhang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have analyzed , using the coupled channel flatt formula , the @xmath69  @xcite and @xmath70  @xcite belle data .",
    "they found that a third sheet pole close , but below , the @xmath63 threshold is needed to describe the data , which supports the idea of the @xmath6 as a mixed state of @xmath71 and @xmath63 components .",
    "an updated flatt analysis of the same data together with the new babar data of the same reactions  @xcite has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming a mechanism for the @xmath6 production via the charmonium components .",
    "the authors conclude that the data clearly indicates a sizable @xmath1 @xmath72 component in the @xmath6 wave function .",
    "finally dong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite show in their analysis of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 decay modes of the @xmath6 that the large value of the ratio @xmath75 measured by the babar collaboration provide a constraint on the value of the @xmath1 component in the @xmath6 . from the experimental values",
    "they deduce a small admixture of the @xmath1 component    having in mind these evidences , in this paper we perform a microscopic coupled channel calculation of the @xmath0 sector including both @xmath1 and @xmath3 states .",
    "the calculation is done in the framework of a constituent quark model widely used in hadronic spectroscopy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the main ingredients of our model .",
    "section iii is devoted to discuss the numerical procedures and the results",
    ". finally we summarize the main findings of our work in the last section .",
    "the constituent quark model used in this work has been extensively described elsewhere  @xcite and therefore we will only summarize here its most relevant aspects .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that the light constituent quark mass appears as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry at some momentum scale . as a consequence",
    "the quark propagator gets modified and quarks acquire a dynamical momentum dependent mass .",
    "the simplest lagrangian must therefore contain chiral fields to compensate the mass term and can be expressed as  @xcite    @xmath76    where @xmath77 , @xmath78 denotes nine pseudoscalar fields @xmath79 with @xmath801, ... ,4 and @xmath81 is the constituent mass .",
    "this constituent quark mass , which vanishes at large momenta and is frozen at low momenta at a value around 300 mev , can be explicitly obtained from the theory but its theoretical behavior can be simulated by parameterizing @xmath82 where @xmath83 300 mev , and    @xmath84 ^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ , .\\ ] ]    the cut - off @xmath85 fixes the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the goldstone boson field matrix @xmath86 can be expanded in terms of boson fields ,    @xmath87    the first term of the expansion generates the constituent quark mass while the second gives rise to a one - boson exchange interaction between quarks .",
    "the main contribution of the third term comes from the two - pion exchange which has been simulated by means of a scalar exchange potential .    in the heavy quark sector chiral symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken and this type of interaction does not act .",
    "however it constrains the model parameters through the light meson phenomenology and provides a natural way to incorporate the pion exchange interaction in the @xmath3 dynamics .    beyond the chiral symmetry breaking scale",
    "one expects the dynamics to be governed by qcd perturbative effects .",
    "they are taken into account through the one gluon - exchange interaction @xcite derived from the lagrangian    @xmath88    where @xmath89 are the su(3 ) color generators and g@xmath90 the gluon field .",
    "the other qcd nonperturbative effect corresponds to confinement , which prevents from having colored hadrons .",
    "such a term can be physically interpreted in a picture in which the quark and the antiquark are linked by a one - dimensional color flux - tube .",
    "the spontaneous creation of light - quark pairs may give rise at same scale to a breakup of the color flux - tube @xcite .",
    "this can be translated into a screened potential  @xcite in such a way that the potential saturates at the same interquark distance .",
    "@xmath91    where @xmath92 is a global constant to fit the origin of energies .",
    "at short distances this potential presents a linear behavior with an effective confinement strength @xmath93 while it becomes constant at large distances .",
    "it has been shown that this form of the potential is important to explain the huge degeneracy observed in the high excited light meson spectrum  @xcite and turns out to be very important for the correct assignment of @xmath94 charmonium states  @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for all these interactions are given in  @xcite .",
    "all these ingredients are needed to explain the hadronic phenomenology .",
    "apart from the obvious confinement potential , gluon exchange is demanded from the hyperfine splitting in charmonium .",
    "moreover , pion exchange is one of the best established interaction in nature being its parameters constraint by a huge amount of experiments .",
    "when goldstone boson exchanges are considered at the quark level together with the oge the possibility of double counting emerges .",
    "this problem has been studied in the literature concluding that the pion can be safely exchanged together with the gluon  @xcite .",
    "constituent quark models are also criticized because they only incorporate a limited sector of the fock space . in particular its applicability to high excited states",
    "may be questionable as more thresholds open up . in our case",
    "the parameters of the model has been fixed in the low lying part of the spectrum where these effects are more easily incorporated into them .",
    "furthermore the main contribution of the open channels are taken into account by the screened confinement potential .      to model the @xmath0 @xmath1 system we assume that the hadronic state is @xmath95 where @xmath96 are @xmath1 eigenstates of the two body hamiltonian , @xmath97 are @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) eigenstates describing the @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) mesons , @xmath102 is the two meson state with @xmath103 quantum numbers coupled to total @xmath104 quantum numbers and @xmath105 is the relative wave function between the two mesons in the molecule . as we always work with eigenstates of the @xmath17-parity operator we use the usual notation in which @xmath3 is the right combination of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the coupling between the two sectors requires the creation of a light quark pair @xmath108 .",
    "similar to the strong decay process this coupling should be in principle driven by the same interquark hamiltonian which determines the spectrum . however ackleh et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the quark pair creation @xmath5 model  @xcite , gives similar results to the microscopic calculation .",
    "the model assumes that the pair creation hamiltonian is @xmath109 which in the non - relativistic reduction is equivalent to the transition operator  @xcite @xmath110^{c=1,i=0,s=1,j=0 } \\label{tbon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) are the quark ( antiquark ) quantum numbers and @xmath113 with @xmath114 is a dimensionless constant that gives the strength of the @xmath2 pair creation from the vacuum . from this operator",
    "we define the transition potential @xmath115 within the @xmath116 model as  @xcite    @xmath117    where @xmath68 is the relative momentum of the two meson state .    using the wave - function from eq .",
    "( [ ec : funonda ] ) and the coupling eq .",
    "( [ vab ] ) we arrive to the coupled equations @xmath118 where @xmath119 are the masses of the bare @xmath1 mesons and @xmath120 is the rgm hamiltonian for the two meson states obtained from the @xmath2 interaction .    solving the coupling with @xmath1 states we finally end up with an schrdinger type equation for the relative wave function of the two meson state @xmath121 where @xmath122 is an effective interaction between the two mesons due to the coupling with intermediate @xmath1 states .    in this way we study the influence of the @xmath123 states on the dynamics of the two meson states .",
    "this is a different point of view from the usually found in the literature where the influence of two meson states ( in general without meson - meson interaction ) in the mass and width of @xmath123 states is studied  @xcite .",
    "our approach allows to generate new states through the meson - meson interaction due to the coupling with @xmath1 states and to the underlying @xmath2 interaction . as we will see the renormalization effects of the @xmath1 mass due to this channel",
    "is small .",
    "the @xmath1 probabilities are given by @xmath124 with the normalization condition @xmath125 .      in order to compare the predictions of our model with the recent belle and babar experimental data we obtain from eq .",

    "a straightforward generalization to include the @xmath3 charged states and other channels gives the expression for the near threshold @xmath3 scattering amplitude @xmath134 where @xmath135 accounts for the width due to other processes different from the opening of the near @xmath3 threshold .",

    "the geometric progression is useful in optimizing the ranges with a small number of free parameters .",
    "moreover the distribution of the gaussian ranges in geometric progression is dense at small ranges , which is well suited for making the wave function correlate with short range potentials .",

    "however the relative branching fraction of both modes can be misleading with respect to the absolute magnitude of the isospin mixing in @xmath6 due to the phase space suppression of the @xmath66 channel against the @xmath65 one .",
    "in fact if we assume that @xmath6 is a @xmath7 molecule , the ratio @xmath187 would be a factor 20 smaller than the experiment due to the different phase space .",
    "it is clear that we need charged components in the wave function but with a different weight with respect to the neutral component .",

    "we now explicitly break isospin symmetry taking the experimental threshold difference into account in our equations and solving for the charged and neutral components .",
