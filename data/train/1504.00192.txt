    "the langevin equation describes a non - markovian process , which approximates the stochastic time evolution of the positional degrees of freedom .",
    "the persistent motion of active particles is here encoded by the exponential decay of the time correlation , with persistence time @xmath17 . for small @xmath18",

    "a stochastic process driven by colored noise , such as that described by equation , is always non - markovian .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to derive an _",
    "exact _ fokker - planck equation for the time evolution of the probability distribution @xcite . nevertheless , an approximate fokker - planck description capable of making accurate predictions can usually be found .",
    "the approximate fokker - planck equation implicitly defines a markov process which best approximates the process of physical interest ( although precisely what constitutes the ` best ' approximation remains a matter of debate ) . from the extensive literature on this subject ( see @xcite and references therein ) has emerged a powerful method due to fox @xcite , in which a perturbative expansion in powers of correlation time is partially resummed using functional calculus . the resulting fokker - planck equation is most accurate for short correlation times ( ` off white ' noise @xcite ) and for one - dimensional models makes predictions in good agreement with simulation data @xcite .",

    "the only caveat is that the condition @xmath35 must be satisfied @xcite .",
    "the range of accessible @xmath34 values thus depends upon the specific form of the bare interaction potential .    within our stochastic calculus approach ,",
    "the effective many - body force emerges in a natural way from the coarse grained langevin equation .",
    "the more standard route ( adopted in all attempts made so far @xcite ) to approach this problem is to derive from the markovian equations the exact fokker - planck equation for the joint distribution of positions and orientations , @xmath36 .",

    "for a phase - separated passive system , recent experiments and simulations have demonstrated that increasing @xmath52 first suppresses the phase separation @xcite and then leads at higher @xmath52 to a reentrant mips @xcite .",
    "schwarz - linek _ et al .",
    "_ have argued that the suppression of phase separation at lower to intermediate @xmath52 occurs in their system because particle pairs bound by the attractive ( depletion ) potential begin to actively escape the potential well , and that this can be mimicked using an effective potential less attractive and shorter - ranged than the bare potential @xcite .    to investigate these phenomena we set @xmath70 , which ensures a phase separated passive state @xcite , and",

    "the phase boundary predicted by the theory is highly consistent with the simulation data .",
    "returning to fig.[figure2]a , we find that for @xmath96 the effective potential develops a repulsive barrier , which grows in height ( see inset ) with increasing @xmath52 , while the potential minimum becomes deeper .",
    "it is well - known that potentials with a short - ranged attraction and long - ranged repulsion ( salr potentials ) exhibit unusual equilibrium phase behaviour , including clustering and microphase - separation @xcite .",
    "although the attractive component of the potential may favour phase separation , the long range repulsion destabilises distinct liquid and gas phases and causes them to break up into droplets or clusters .",
    "this represents a non - spinodal type of phase transition , characterized by a divergence in the structure factor at finite wavevector .",
    "the appearance of a repulsive barrier in the effective potential suggests that a similar mechanism may be at work in passively attractive systems subject to high @xmath52 activity .    in fig.[figure2]c",

    "figure 1 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , a detailed study of the connection between the potential barrier and high @xmath52 clustering goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in summary , we have shown that systems of active spherical brownian particles can be mapped onto an equilibrium system interacting via an effective , activity - dependent many - body potential .",
    "the only required inputs are the bare potential , thermodynamic statepoint and the parameters specifying the state of activity .",
    "our theory captures the phenomenon of mips in repulsive systems and provides first - principles predictions for the activity dependence of the pair correlations , in very good agreement with brownian dynamics simulation .",
    "as far as we are aware there exists no other approach capable of predicting from the microscopic interactions the pair correlation functions of an active system .",
    "further insight into the steady state particle distribution could in principle be obtained by investigating the three - body correlations .",
    "these could be obtained by employing the effective potential in a higher - order liquid state integral equation theory ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .    for passively attractive systems the theory rationalizes the experimental finding @xcite that increasing activity can suppress passive phase separation .",
    "we find that as @xmath52 is increased from zero to intermediate values the minimum of the effective potential becomes less deep , thus weakening the cohesion of the liquid phase . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there is currently no alternative theoretical explanation of phase - transition suppression in active suspensions .",
    "it is an appealing aspect of our theory that the suppression of passive phase separation follows naturally from the same approach which yields activity - induced attraction for repulsive potentials . for high values of @xmath52 the appearance of a repulsive barrier in the effective",
    "potential suggests that the reentrant phase separation observed in simulations @xcite may be interpreted using concepts of equilibrium clustering in salr potential systems .",
    "this will be a subject of future detailed investigations .",
    "it is known that care must be exercised when analysing salr potentials , as traditional liquid state theories can prove misleading @xcite .",
    "a key step in our development is the fox approximation @xcite , which yields an effective markovian description of the coarse - grained equation . making a markovian approximation",
    "automatically imposes an effective equilibrium , however , we are aware that there exist certain situations for which this breaks down @xcite . establishing more clearly the range of validity of our approach , as well as its possible extensions , will be the subject of ongoing study .",
    "however , it is already clear that going beyond the markovian approximation will be very challenging .",
    "indeed , such a step may not even be desirable .",
    "any kind of non - markovian description would lead inevitably to a loss of the effective equilibrium picture and the physical intuition associated with it .",
    "it thus seems likely that practical improvements to the present approach will retain the markovian description while seeking to optimize , or improve upon , the fox approximation for certain classes of bare potential .",
    "very recently , maggi _",
    "et al . _ have employed an alternative approach to treating stochastic processes driven by ornstein - uhlenbeck noise @xcite .",
    "a comparison of their approach with the fox method employed here would be very interesting .    with a view to further applications of our approach , we note that there has recently been considerable interest in active suspensions at very high densities @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been found using computer simulations that activity has a strong influence on the location of the hard - sphere glass transition , dynamic correlation functions , such as the intermediate scattering function , and static pair correlations @xcite . within our effective equilibrium framework ,",
    "increasing the activity of a passively repulsive system generates an effective attraction .",
    "we can therefore anticipate that for volume fractions just above the glass transition it will be possible to observe a reentrant glass transition , namely a melting of the glass followed by revitrification , as a function of increasing @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , the nontrivial evolution of the effective potential as a function of @xmath52 for attractive bare potentials ( cf .",
    "fig.[figure2]a ) suggests these systems will present a rich variety of glassy states .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .    finally , we mention that a natural generalization of the present theory is to treat spatially inhomogeneous systems in external fields .",
    "recent microscopic studies of active particles under confinement ( e.g.  in a harmonic trap @xcite ) have provided considerable insight , however none of the existing approaches have considered effective _ interparticle _ interactions . inhomogeneous generalization of the present theory enables the interaction between mips and external fields to be investigated on the microscopic level .",
    "our preliminary investigations reveal , for example , activity - induced wetting at a planar substrate and capillary - condensation under confinement .",

    "we also recall that spherical harmonics are eigenvectors of the operator @xmath107 ( in spherical coordinates ) , namely that @xmath108 inserting in and using we obtain @xmath109 multiplying both sides of by @xmath110 , integrating over solid angle and using the orthogonality property , @xmath111 , yields @xmath112 which has the solution @xmath113 where the @xmath114 are a new set of coefficients .",

    "<S> the theory shows that phase separation becomes suppressed by moderate activity , consistent with recent experiments and simulations , and suggests a mechanism for reentrant cluster formation at high activity .    </S>",
    "<S> active colloidal particles in suspension are currently the subject of considerable attention , due largely to their ability to model self - organisation phenomena in biological systems , but also as a new branch of fundamental research in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics : assemblies of active colloids are intrinsically out - of - equilibrium systems . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to their passive counterparts , active colloids undergo both solvent induced brownian motion and a self - propulsion which requires a continual consumption of energy from the local environment . </S>",
    "<S> several idealized experimental model systems have been developed , such as catalytic janus particles @xcite , colloids with artificial flagella @xcite and light activated particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of active systems has been further aided by the development of simple theoretical models , which aim to capture the essential physical mechanisms and which have been used to study e.g. bacteria , cells or filaments in the cytoskeleton @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> active particles are characterised by a persistent motion , which can lead to ` self trapping ' dynamics and a rich variety of related collective phenomena @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even the simplest models of active spherical particles with purely repulsive interactions can display the phenomenon of motility - induced phase separation ( mips ) @xcite . in many respects , mips resembles the equilibrium phase separation familiar from passive systems with an attractive component to the interaction potential ( e.g.  the lennard - jones potential ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this apparent similarity has motivated several recent attempts to map an assembly of active particles onto a passive equilibrium system , interacting via an effective attraction ( usually taken to be a very short range sticky - sphere potential @xcite ) . despite the intuitive appeal of mapping to an equilibrium system </S>",
    "<S> , there exists no systematic theoretical approach capable of predicting an effective equilibrium potential directly from the bare interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> our current understanding of mips has largely been gained through either simulation @xcite or phenomenological theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological theory is based on an equation for the coarse - grained density , featuring a local speed and a local orientational relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> although the precise relationship between these one - body fields and the interparticle interaction potential remains to be clarified , some progress in this direction has been made @xcite . on a more microscopic level </S>",
    "<S> , it has recently been shown that a general system of active particles does not have an equation of state @xcite , due to the influence of the confining boundaries , however , one can be recovered for the special case of active brownian spheres @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we report a first - principles theory for systems of active brownian spheres , which demonstrates explicitly how an effective many - body interaction potential is induced by activity . </S>",
    "<S> an appealing feature of this approach is that intuition gained from equilibrium can be used to understand the steady - state properties of active systems . </S>",
    "<S> the required input quantities are the passive ( ` bare ' ) interaction potential , the rotational diffusion coefficient and the particle propulsion speed . </S>",
    "<S> the theory generates as output the static correlation functions and phase behaviour of the active system . for a repulsive bare interaction </S>",
    "<S> , activity generates an attractive effective pair potential , thus providing an intuitive explanation for the mips observed in simulations @xcite . for an attractive bare potential , </S>",
    "<S> we find that increasing activity first reduces the effective attraction , consistent with the experiments of schwarz - linek _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , before leading at higher activity to the development of a repulsive potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that this barrier may be related to the reentrant phase behaviour observed in simulation by redner _ </S>",

    "<S> the paper will be structured as follows : in  [ theory ] we specify the microscopic dynamics and describe how to eliminate orientational degrees of freedom . from the resulting coarse - grained , non - markovian langevin equation we derive a fokker - planck equation for the positional degrees of freedom , from which we identify an effective pair potential . in  [ results ] we employ the effective pair potential in an equilibrium integral equation theory and investigate the structure and phase behaviour of both repulsive and attractive bare potentials . in the former case we predict mips , whereas in the latter case phase separation is suppressed by activity . </S>",
