    "molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio calculations are powerful and important tools in modern computational chemistry@xcite .",
    "classical md simulations , neglecting the quantum effects , can deal with a wide range of experimental dynamics properties .",
    "ab initio calculations , on the other hand , provide a more precise description of quantized particles , but solving the quantum dynamics of many - body systems remains one of the most challenging problems to the unfavorable computer scaling with system size and time scale .",
    "the calculations of static equilibrium properties of a quantum mechanical system are comparatively easy by investigating the path integral representation . these methods , including the primitive path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd)@xcite , centroid molecular dynamics ( cmd)@xcite and ring polymer molecular dynamic ( rpmd)@xcite , make use of the imaginary - time path integral formalism and exploit the exact equilibrium mapping between a quantum - mechanical particle and a classical ring polymer",
    ". thus various of techniques of md simulations can be directly implemented in pimd simulations@xcite .",
    "one of the major problems in the pimd simulations is to integrate the ring polymer hamiltonian dynamics in the cartesian coordinate .",
    "as the integrated systems are chaotic , it s not possible to obtain accurate trajectories for more than a short time interval .",
    "rather , we expect to generate the trajectories that satisfy correct statistical properties , such as near - conservation of the hamiltonian and preservation of the wedge product . in practice",
    ", these properties can be achieved by symplectic and time - reversible integrators@xcite .",
    "another problem in real simulations is that the harmonic oscillations of the beads and the fast bonded force restrict the time step , whereas the evaluations of slow non - bonded forces accounts for most of the computational time . a wise way",
    "is to integrate different components of force field using different time steps , termed the multiple time stepping scheme ( mts)@xcite . the numerical integrators with variable time steps have facilitated the inclusions of full electrostatic forces and lennard - jones interactions .",
    "in addition , since the harmonic oscillations among beads can be solved exactly by normal mode analysis , the mts scheme ( also termed as trigonometric methods ) preserves the hamiltonian much better than traditional verlet / leapfrog method .",
    "however , the mts scheme still suffers from the numerical resonances when the frequency of slow force impulse coincides with a natural frequency of the system , which may lead to an accuracy reduction@xcite .",
    "this instability may be more severe in ring polymer hamiltonian dynamics , as the frequency of non - bond force is comparable to that of the harmonic interactions within beads . to ameliorate this problem , it s proposed to treat small covalent molecules as a set of rigid bodies@xcite , which not only significantly reduces the degrees of freedom required to represent the system , but also removes the intramolecular vibrations .",
    "the price to pay is to impose several holomonic constraints on the hamiltonian dynamics , which needs to be preserved in the numerical integrations . in the cartesian",
    "coordinates , this problem can be solved efficiently by shake@xcite and its velocity version rattle@xcite , and these algorithms have been throughly analyzed in @xcite .",
    "several methods based on shake are proposed to achieve better convergence@xcite . for the holonomic constraints in more complicated geometries ,",
    "the corresponding integrators are discussed in @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on numerical integrations of constrained ring - polymer hamiltonian dynamics in the cartesian coordinate , where only holonomic constraints are considered . since the system consists of a fictitious ring polymer connected by stiff harmonic springs , the traditional shake and rattle will not conserve the hamiltonian well unless the time step is very small@xcite .",
    "we propose a trigonometric method based on the splitting of operators .",
    "this method integrates the ring polymer hamiltonian dynamics under normal mode representation and preserves the constraints by solving an algebraic equation iteratively .",
    "it shows that this integrator allows variable time steps and the use of mollified forces , which origin from the mollified impulse method@xcite .",
    "we also analyze its near - conservation of hamiltonian in the framework of modulated fourier expansion@xcite , with its accuracy presented by numerical tests .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "<S> a class of trigonometric integrator is proposed for the constrained ring polymer hamiltonian dynamics , arising from the path integral molecular dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the integrator is formulated by the composition of flows , thereby integrating the cartesian equations of motions under normal mode representation and preserving the holonomic constraints by iterations . </S>",
    "<S> it is illustrated that the trigonometric method can preserve the symplectic structure and time - reversibility , and its near - conservation of hamiltonian is analyzed in the framework of modulated fourier expansion analysis . </S>",
    "<S> numerical examples illustrating its stability are presented using the spc / e force field at 298k .    </S>",
