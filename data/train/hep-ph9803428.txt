    "the semileptonic inclusive decays @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , offer , together with the radiative electromagnetic penguin decay @xmath18 , presently the most popular testing grounds for the standard model ( sm ) in the flavor sector .",
    "this is reflected by the impressive experimental and theoretical activity in this field , reviewed recently in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we shall concentrate here on the decay @xmath16 for which the first theoretical calculations were reported a decade ago , emphasizing the sensitivity of the dilepton mass spectrum and decay rate to the top quark mass in the short - distance contribution . with the discovery of the top quark and a fairly accurate measurement of its mass @xcite , theoretical emphasis has changed from predicting the top quark mass using this decay to using its measured value as input and making theoretically accurate predictions for the decay rates and spectra .",
    "this will help confront the predictions in the sm with experiment more precisely and will allow to search for new phenomena , such as supersymmetry .",
    "since these early papers , considerable theoretical work has been done on the decay  in the context of the standard model .",
    "this includes , among other aspects , the calculation of the complete leading order perturbative corrections in the qcd coupling constant @xmath0 to the dilepton invariant mass spectrum @xcite , forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry of the leptons @xcite , and , additionally , leading order power corrections in @xmath19 to the decay rate , dilepton invariant mass spectrum and fb asymmetry @xcite , using the heavy quark expansion technique ( hqet ) .",
    "we recall that the @xmath19 corrections to the dilepton spectrum and decay rate in were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite but their results were at variance with the ones derived later in ref .",
    "the power corrected dilepton mass spectrum and fb asymmetry have been rederived for the massless @xmath20-quark case recently @xcite , confirming the results in ref .",
    "corrections of order @xmath21 to the dilepton mass spectrum away from the @xmath22-resonant regions have also been worked out @xcite , making use of earlier work on similar power corrections in the decay rate for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 power corrections to the left - right asymmetry @xcite have been presented in @xcite correcting an earlier calculation of the same @xcite .",
    "likewise , the longitudinal polarization of the lepton , @xmath23 , in @xmath24 at the partonic level has been worked out @xcite ; the other two orthogonal polarization components @xmath25 ( the component in the decay plane ) and @xmath23 ( the component normal to the decay plane ) were subsequently worked out in ref .  @xcite . as an alternative to hqet , @xmath3-meson wave - function effects in the decay",
    "have also been studied for the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and fb asymmetry @xcite , using the fermi motion ( fm ) model @xcite .",
    "some of the cited works have also addressed the long - distance aspect of the decay having to do with the resonant structure of the dilepton invariant mass spectrum .",
    "we shall leave out the @xmath26-resonant contributions in this paper and will present a detailed phenomenological study including them elsewhere @xcite .    this theoretical work , despite some uncertainties associated with the ld - part , will undoubtedly contribute significantly to a meaningful comparison of the sm and experiment in the decay . still , concerning the sd - contribution",
    ", some aspects of this decay remain to be studied theoretically . in the context of experimental searches for ,",
    "it has been emphasized ( see , for example , the cleo paper @xcite ) that theoretical estimates of the hadronic invariant mass and hadron energy spectra in this decay will greatly help in providing improved control of the signal and they will also be needed to correct for the experimental acceptance .",
    "in addition to their experimental utility , hadron spectra in heavy hadron decays are also of considerable theoretical interest in their own right , as reflected by similar studies done for the charged current induced semileptonic decays @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where the main emphasis has been on testing hqet and/or in determining the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the hadronic invariant mass spectra in @xmath31 and @xmath32 decays have striking similarities and differences .",
    "for example , both of these processes have at the parton level a delta function behavior @xmath33 , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the hadronic invariant mass at the parton level .",
    "thus , the entire invariant mass spectrum away from @xmath36 is generated perturbatively ( by gluon bremsstrahlung ) and through the @xmath3-hadron non - perturbative effects .",
    "hence , measurements of these spectra would lead to direct information on the qcd dynamics and to a better determination of the non - perturbative parameters .",
    "there are also obvious differences in these decays , namely the decay @xmath37 is intrinsically a lot simpler due to the absence of the resonating @xmath6 contributions , which one must include to get the inclusive spectra in , or else use data in restricted phase space where the @xmath6-resonant contributions are subleading .",
    "having stated the motivations , we study hadron spectra in the decay  in this paper .",
    "we first compute the leading order ( in @xmath0 ) perturbative qcd and power ( @xmath1 corrections to the hadronic invariant mass and hadron energy spectra at the parton level .",
    "in addition to the bremsstrahlung contribution @xmath38 , there are important non - perturbative effects even in @xmath39 that come from the relations between the @xmath40 quark mass and the @xmath3 meson mass . in hqet , this takes the form @xmath41 , where @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath42 are the hqet parameters .",
    "keeping , for the sake of simplicity just the @xmath14 term , the hadronic invariant mass @xmath7 is related to @xmath35 and the partonic energy @xmath43 by @xmath44 .",
    "this gives rise to a non - trivial spectrum in the entire region @xmath45 .",
    "including both the @xmath46 and @xmath47 terms generates hadron energy and hadronic invariant mas spectrum with terms of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the power- and perturbatively corrected hadron spectra up to and including these terms are presented here .",
    "the @xmath19 corrections in the hadron energy spectrum are found to be small over a good part of this spectrum .",
    "however , the expansion in @xmath5 fails near the lower end - point and near the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "the hadronic invariant mass spectrum is reliably calculable over a limited region only , namely for @xmath52 .",
    "hadronic moments @xmath10 and @xmath53 , on the other hand , are calculable in hqet and we have summarized the results for the first two moments @xmath12 in a letter @xcite , based on this study .",
    "the hadronic invariant mass moments are sensitive to the hqet parameters @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "this provides potentially an independent determination of these quantities .",
    "we think that the hadron spectra in and @xmath28 can be related to each other over limited phase space and this could help in vastly improving the present precision on @xmath30 @xcite and the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .    in view of the continued phenomenological interest in the fm model @xcite , motivated in part by its close resemblance to the hqet framework @xcite",
    ", we also compute the hadron spectra in  in this model , taking into account the @xmath47 perturbative qcd corrections .",
    "the fm model is characterized by two parameters which are usually taken as @xmath54 , the gaussian width of the @xmath40-quark momentum , and @xmath55 , the spectator quark mass in the @xmath3 hadron ; the @xmath40-quark mass is a momentum - dependent quantity ( see section 6 for details ) .",
    "the matrix element of the kinetic energy operator , @xmath13 and the binding energy @xmath14 can be calculated in terms of the fm model parameters .",
    "the difference between the effective @xmath40-quark mass , which is a derived quantity in the fm model , and the @xmath3-meson mass can also be expressed via an hqet - type relation , @xmath56 . however , there is no analog of @xmath42 in the fm model .",
    "having defined the equivalence between the fm model and hqet parameters , we shall use @xmath14 and @xmath13 to also characterize the fm model parameters .",
    "the dependence of the hadron spectra in the fm model in the decay  on the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath13 is studied in this paper .",
    "we find that the hadron energy spectrum in in the fm model is stable against variations of the model parameters .",
    "the hadron energy spectra in the fm model and hqet are also found to be close to each other in regions where hqet holds .",
    "this feature was also noticed in the context of the decay @xmath28 in ref .",
    "the hadronic invariant mass spectrum depends sensitively on the parameters of the fm model - a behavior which has again its parallel in studies related to the decay @xmath28 @xcite as well as in hqet .",
    "hadronic moments @xmath57 and @xmath58 are computed in the fm model and are found to be remarkably close to their counterparts calculated in hqet for equivalent values of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "the picture that emerges from these comparisons is that the spectra and moments in the two approaches are rather similar , though not identical .",
    "we also study the effects of the cleo experimental cuts on the branching ratios , hadron spectra and hadronic moments in  in the fm model and the results are presented here .",
    "these can be compared with data when they become available .",
