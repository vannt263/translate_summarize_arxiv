    "a collection of interacting coupled oscillators is one of the most intensively studied systems showing a dynamic phase transition called a synchronization transition  @xcite .",
    "such systems have been used as models to describe various phenomena such as the pacemakers of the heart , the collection of amoeba , large - scale ecosystems  @xcite , and fiber - optic networks of optoelectronic oscillators  @xcite . as the coupling strength increases ,",
    "such systems undergo a phase transition from the desynchronized ( disordered ) state to the synchronized ( ordered ) state characterized by critical phenomena .",
    "the most well - known theoretical formalism is the kuramoto model  @xcite where the oscillators interact with each other by a sinusoidal coupling strength with respect to the phase differences of the two oscillators .    aside from the steady - state behavior after the initial transient behavior",
    ", the dynamical aspect of the oscillators has also been studied recently  @xcite . especially , the effects of temporally varying interaction structures  @xcite themselves are worthwhile to investigate since we can systematically analyze the response of systems to such structural changes of interactions  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the mobile oscillator is considered in refs .",
    "@xcite as an example of temporally switching interactions . in this brief report",
    ", we take the kuramoto model with periodically switching interactions and analyze the temporal response in the collective phase of oscillators to such periodicity in interactions .",
    "such periodically switching interactions may have implications to biological or social communications among compartments under natural circadian rhythms , for instance  @xcite .    in terms of the temporally averaged order parameter and its amplitude of oscillation",
    ", we verify that the model undergoes the same synchronization transition as the mean - field ( mf ) kuramoto model  @xcite with the finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis .",
    "furthermore , with numerical simulations and analogy to the kinetic ising model  @xcite , we show that the signature of the synchronization transition is revealed in the relative phase shift of the order parameter with respect to the density of interactions , as a resonance - like phase - shift inversion .",
    "the result is also consistent with the diverging relaxation time at the critical coupling strength  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we claim that the system s temporal response to the temporally changing interactions can be used as an indicator of a phase transition .",
    "we consider the kuramoto - type oscillator dynamics  @xcite composed of @xmath0 oscillators as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the set of oscillators phases , @xmath3 is the set of natural frequencies of oscillators given by the gaussian distribution with average @xmath4 and unit variance , and the symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath5 if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected and @xmath4 otherwise .",

    "the edge densities change periodically with the exact triangle wave subject to the frequency @xmath11 , from fully connected edges to isolated oscillators without interactions .",
    "note that the factor @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ kuramoto_equation ] ) is to directly compare the coupling strength @xmath15 of our model with @xmath16 to the @xmath15 value in the original kuramoto model , where @xmath17 refers to the temporal average of @xmath18 over a period .",
    "in addition to the original control parameter of coupling strength @xmath15 in the kuramoto model , the edge frequency @xmath11 driving the system is a crucial parameter as well .",
    "the response of oscillators to the toggling interactions is measured by the temporal behavior of conventional phase order parameter @xmath19 where @xmath20 = \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp[i\\phi_{i}(t ) ] .",

    "we provide the java applet simulating this model system in case of globally connected oscillators , for readers to observe the behavior of a system of relatively small sizes  @xcite . from now on ,",
    "we present our numerical simulation results and their implications .",
    "and the interaction density @xmath22 . the system size @xmath23 , the edge frequency @xmath24 , and the time series of @xmath19 depending on @xmath15 are shown as smooth curves in ( a ) and @xmath22 ( independent of @xmath15 ) as black triangle waves in ( a ) . the @xmath25@xmath26 diagram for @xmath27 after the transient behavior is shown in ( b ) .",
    "all the curves are results averaged over @xmath28 samples . ]     for various system sizes with the critical exponents of the original mf kuramoto model [ @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the edge frequency is @xmath24 . ]",
    "first , we consider the globally coupled case , i.e. , @xmath32 . a typical temporal behavior of oscillators is illustrated in fig .  [ typical_example ] , in case of @xmath24 .",
    "note that the oscillating behavior of the order parameter @xmath19 driven by switching edges ( with the same frequency ) is shown even in case of quite low values of @xmath15 , for which the original mf kuramoto model corresponds to the disordered phase .",
    "another interesting aspect is the relative phase shift of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath22 . in other words , the maximum or minimum of @xmath19 occurs after some time when the maximum of minimum of @xmath22 is reached , as shown in fig .  [ typical_example](a ) .",
    "moreover , as @xmath15 is increased , the delay for maximum values and the delay for minimum values become more asymmetric , as clearly shown in fig .  [ typical_example](b ) . in spite of such temporal oscillations of @xmath19 , the temporally averaged value @xmath33 ( averaged after the transient time @xmath34 ) shows exactly the same universality class of synchronization transition as the mf kuramoto model with @xmath30 , and @xmath35  @xcite , as described in the fss scaling collapse with @xmath36 ( the scaling function @xmath37 itself , as well as the critical coupling strength @xmath38 , depends on @xmath11 ) shown in fig .  [ fss ] .",
    "we suggest the slightly larger value of @xmath39 than that of the mf model @xmath40  @xcite stem from additional quenched randomness caused by @xmath12 for edges , similarly to the lower @xmath41 ( the disordered phase extended ) for the kinetic ising model under the external oscillating field  @xcite .",
    "since we have confirmed the mf transition for @xmath33 , from now on we focus the temporal behavior of @xmath19 , especially with respect to the oscillating interaction strength @xmath22 .     between maximum and minimum values of @xmath19 oscillation and the area @xmath42 enclosed by the loop in @xmath25@xmath26 the diagram",
    "are shown in the @xmath15@xmath11 plane .",
    "the system size @xmath23 , and the color - coded values are @xmath43 ( a ) , @xmath44 ( b ) , @xmath42 ( c ) , and @xmath45 ( d ) .",
    "the time series @xmath19 for @xmath27 after the transient behavior is used , and all the results are averaged over @xmath28 samples . ]     ( a ) and @xmath46 ( b ) as functions of @xmath15 , for various @xmath11 values .",
    "the black vertical lines correspond to the mf critical coupling strength @xmath47 . ]    to characterize the oscillating behavior more quantitatively , we systematically measure the difference between maximum and minimum values of @xmath19 oscillation denoted as @xmath43 ( roughly twice the amplitude of @xmath19 ) and the enclosed area in the @xmath25@xmath26 diagram denoted as @xmath42 , for a wide range of @xmath11 and @xmath15 values .",
    "note that the data shown here are from the system size @xmath23 , but we have checked that there exists no significant finite - size effects based on the simulations results with smaller and larger systems . the time series @xmath19 for @xmath27 after the transient behavior is used , and all the results are from averaged over @xmath28 samples for all the simulations from now on . as shown in fig .",
    "[ amplitude_area_density ] , the scaling behavior of @xmath43 and @xmath42 is quite similar , and notably both @xmath43 and @xmath42 seem to be inversely proportional to @xmath11 for @xmath48 .",
    "this scaling behavior makes the @xmath49 and @xmath46 in figs .",
    "[ amplitude_area_density](b ) and ( d ) depend only on @xmath15 for @xmath48 , and is also clearly observable from the fact that the curves for @xmath48 are collapsed in fig .  [ amplitude_area_2d ] .",
    "since @xmath11 represents the angular velocity of the fluctuation of edges ( hence that of @xmath19 ) , @xmath44 corresponds to the `` linear velocity '' of @xmath19 , which is shown to be conserved for a given value of @xmath15 .",
    "more importantly , the synchronization transition is clearly shown in the steep change of @xmath43 and @xmath42 near the critical coupling strength @xmath50 for the original mf kuramoto model , as shown in figs .  [ amplitude_area_density ] and [ amplitude_area_2d ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the signature of the mf synchronization transition of kuramoto model is resurfaced in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath42 .    aside from the amplitude of @xmath25 and enclosed area in the @xmath25@xmath26 diagram , a notable property of the @xmath25@xmath26 diagram in fig .",
    "[ typical_example](b ) is successive change in the shapes of enclosed regions , as @xmath15 is increased .",
    "first , the desynchronization process of @xmath19 after the onset of decreasing phase of @xmath22 is slower than the synchronization process of @xmath19 after the onset of increasing phase of @xmath22 in general .",
    "this asymmetry is natural , since the response of the order parameter to such linear functions is integrated form , i.e. , quadratic functions depending on the initial values .",
    "we show that the synchronization transition is also observed in the phase shift of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath22 as well .",
    "to systematically analyze such a phase shift caused by the temporal delay of @xmath19 , we check the relative height difference of @xmath25 at the right and left ends in fig .",
    "[ typical_example](b ) , corresponding to @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively , also affects the shape of enclosed regions . in fig .",
    "[ height_diff](a ) , we plot such height differences in the @xmath15@xmath11 space , and the height difference occurs mainly in small @xmath11 and large @xmath15 regimes .",
    "interestingly , near @xmath53 in relatively large @xmath11 regimes , the difference becomes negative , which corresponds to @xmath54 .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ phase - shift inversion_. @xmath53 is close to the mf critical coupling constant @xmath50 again , and we suggest that it is related to critical slowing down near the critical point in a phase transition , as shown in the diverging relaxation time @xmath55 at @xmath50  @xcite , given by @xmath56 \\textrm{erfc}[1/(\\sqrt{2}\\tau)]$ ] .",
    "this resonance - like phase - shift inversion phenomenon occurs similarly to the frequency matching condition around the phase transition in the mf kinetic ising model  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the mf synchronization transition in the kuramoto model is also reflected in the temporal response to the periodically switching interactions .     and @xmath52 , for the globally coupled case ( a ) and sfns with @xmath57 ( b ) , @xmath58 ( c ) , and @xmath59 ( d ) . note that the rescaled coupling strength @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is set as @xmath62 , is used for ( b)(d ) , to compare with the globally coupled case ( a ) with the same eq .",
    "( [ kuramoto_equation ] ) .",
    "the same system size @xmath23 is used for all the cases . ]      to validate our conclusion on the phase transition in terms of phase - shift inversion , we use substrate network topologies other than the globally coupled one . the static scale - free network ( sfn )",
    "model  @xcite with the tunable degree distribution @xmath63 provides various underlying interaction structures such as the pure mf case ( @xmath64 ) , the mf with critical exponents depend on @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , and eventually the one where critical coupling strength vanishes as @xmath67 ( @xmath68 )  @xcite .",
    "we use the sfn model for @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ kuramoto_equation ] ) and observe the phase - shift inversion diagram for the three representative cases : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ height_diff](b)(d ) .",
    "one can observe the phase - shift inversion in sfn cases where the synchronization transition exists ( @xmath70 ) as well , at lower coupling strength explained by @xmath71 when @xmath61 is fixed  @xcite , where @xmath72 represents the averaged @xmath73 over the entire nodes in a network .",
    "the @xmath68 case reveals its vanishing critical point in the fact that the seeming phase - shift inversion occurs in much lower values ( and over the very narrow region ) of coupling strength [ fig .",
    "[ height_diff](d ) ] , due to the finite - size effect .",
    "therefore , the results from sfns also clearly support the fact that phase - shift inversion reflects the phase transition .",
    "we have studied the kuramoto model under periodically switching interactions , checked that it shows the same mean - field synchronization transition as the original kuramoto model with the finite - size scaling analysis , and found that the phase transition is observed in terms of dynamical properties such as the amplitude of oscillation of the order parameter and its relative phase shift with respect to the overall strength of interactions .",
    "in particular , the latter causes the phase - shift inversion phenomenon that the significantly large phase shift near the phase transition let the order parameter at the minimum interaction density to be larger than that at the maximum interaction density .",
    "the conclusion does not only hold for the globally connected substrate structure , but also holds for other types of substrate structures such as scale - free networks .",
    "such observations strongly suggest that our model is related to the mean - field kinetic ising model with the frequency matching condition around the phase transition  @xcite and would be worth investigating further . since periodicity plays important roles in many parts of the nature , especially for systems under natural circadian rhythms or external stimuli",
    ", our results suggest that the temporal response to such periodicity can be an important cue to characterize the system .",
