    "the theory unifying antiferromagnetism ( af ) and superconductivity ( sc ) to describe global phase diagram of high-@xmath0 superconductors was recently proposed by zhang .",
    "@xcite in this approach , based on symmetry principles , a three - dimensional order parameter ( the staggered magnetization ) describing the af phase and a complex order parameter ( with two real components ) , describing a spin singlet d - wave sc phase are grouped in five - component vector called a superspin .",
    "the so(3 ) symmetry of spin rotations ( which is spontaneously broken in the af phase ) and the electro - magnetic so(2 ) invariance ( whose breaking defines sc phase ) along with well - defined af to sc and vice versa rotation operators form so(5 ) symmetry . in the zhang s theory both ordered phase arise once so(5 )  is spontaneously broken and the competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity is related to direction of the superspinin the five - dimensional space .",
    "the low energy dynamics of the system is determined in terms of the goldstone bosons and their interactions specified by the so(5 ) symmetry .",
    "the kinetic energy of the system is that of a so(5 )  rigid rotor and the system is described by a so(5 ) non - linear quantum @xmath2 model ( nlq@xmath2 m ) .",
    "the so(5 ) quantum rotor model offers a landau - ginzburg - like ( lg )  approach for the high-@xmath0 problem .",
    "however , it goes much beyond the traditional lg  theory , since it captures dynamics . while the so(5 )",
    "symmetry was originally proposed in the context of an effective field - theory description of the high-@xmath0 superconductors , its prediction can also be tested within microscopic models .",
    "microscopicmodels1,microscopicmodels2,microscopicmodels3,microscopicmodels4,microscopicmodels5,arrigoni for example , numerical evidence for approximate so(5 )  symmetry of the hubbard model came out from exact diagonalization of small sized clusters .",
    "@xcite the global features of the phase diagram deduced from so(5 ) theory based on a spherical quantum rotors @xcite agree qualitatively with the general topology of the observed phase diagram of high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "the quantitative investigation of the quantum critical point scenario within the concept of the so(5 ) group , _",
    "e.g. _ the scaling of the contribution to the electrical resistivity due spin fluctuations showed linear resistivity dependence on temperature for increasing quantum fluctuation  being a hallmark example of anomalous properties in cuprate materials . @xcite the systematic studies of magnetic properties of the so(5 ) theory showed that the theory yields a qualitative scenario for the evolution of magnetic behavior , which is consistent with experiments . @xcite",
    "it qualitatively explains the results of experimental measurements ( notably the nmr relaxation rates ) with correct predictions of behavior of uniform spin susceptibility in high temperatures .",
    "also the energy dependence of the momentum - integrated dynamic spin susceptibility show features , which are in qualitative agreement with experimental findings .",
    "thermal fluctuations are pronounced in the high-@xmath0 superconductors due to number of reasons .",
    "the carrier density is rather small , the anisotropy is large and the critical temperature is high .",
    "it turns out that deviations from the mean - field behavior are present in the specific heat @xmath3 at the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 . in the mean - field bcs theory ,",
    "a second order transition with a jump in a specific heat at @xmath0 takes place . in contrary , in most high-@xmath0 superconductors thermal fluctuations seem to restore common behavior .    the aim of the present paper is to study quantitatively basic thermodynamic functions resulting from the so(5 ) theory , thereby substantiating this theoretical framework .",
    "our study may also provide a useful diagnostic tool for testing the basic principles of so(5 ) theory by comparing the quantitative predictions ( _ e.g. _ , specific heat ) with the outcome of the relevant experiments .",
    "the outline of the reminder of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we begin by setting up the quantum so(5 ) hamiltonian and the corresponding lagrangian . in section",
    "iii we find closed forms of various thermodynamic functions .",
    "we calculate free energy , entropy and specific heat .",
    "finally , in section iv we summarize the conclusions to be drawn from out work .",
    "we consider the low - energy hamiltonian of superspins placed in the nodes of a discrete three dimensional simple cubic ( 3dsc ) lattice , @xmath4    indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 number lattice sites running from @xmath7 to @xmath8 - the total number of sites , while @xmath9,@xmath10 denote superspin @xmath11 components ( @xmath12 refers to antiferromagnetic and @xmath13 superconducting order , respectively ) .",
    "the superspin components are mutually commuting ( according to zhang s formulation ) and their values are restricted by the rigidity constraint @xmath14 .    the first part of the equation ( [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) is the kinetic energy of the system ( being simply that of a so(5 ) rigid rotor ) , where @xmath15are generators of lie so(5 ) algebra ( expressed by total charge @xmath16 , spin and so - called @xmath17operators ) , @xmath18 are momenta conjugated to respective superspin components : @xmath19 = i\\delta _ { \\mu \\nu } \\end{aligned}\\]]and parameter @xmath20 measures the kinetic energy of the rotors ( an analog of moment of inertia ) .    the second part of the hamiltonian is the inter - superspin interaction energy with @xmath21 being the stiffness in the charge and spin channel . in the 3dsc lattice , @xmath21 is nonvanishing for the nearest neighbors and its fourier transform @xmath22is simply @xmath23for convenience , we will further introduce the density of states @xmath24which for 3dsc@xcite lattice reads : @xmath25 \\theta \\left ( 3-\\left\\vert \\xi \\right\\vert \\right ) \\text{,}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath26 is the elliptic integral of the first kind and @xmath27 is the step function ellipticfunction .",
    "the last two parts of the equation ( [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) provide symmetry so(5 ) breaking terms . in the result of their interplay ,",
