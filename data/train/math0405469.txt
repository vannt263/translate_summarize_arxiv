    "there has been a fruitful interplay between c*-algebras and dynamical systems , which can be summarized by the diagram @xmath7 a classic example is the pair of c*-algebras @xmath5 , @xmath4 that krieger and cuntz @xcite associated with a shift of finite type .",
    "they computed the k - groups of these algebras , and observed that @xmath8 was the same as a dimension group that krieger had earlier defined in dynamical terms @xcite .",
    "krieger @xcite had shown that this dimension group , with an associated automorphism , determined the matrix @xmath9 up to shift equivalence .",

    "cuntz @xcite showed that the k - groups of @xmath4 are exactly the bowen - franks invariants for flow equivalence .",
    "not only have these algebras provided interesting invariants for the dynamical systems , but the favor has been returned , in the sense that these algebras have been an inspiration for many developments in c*-algebras .    given a piecewise monotonic map @xmath0 of the unit interval , we will associate two c*-algebras @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and calculate their k - theory , thus getting invariants for @xmath0 .",
