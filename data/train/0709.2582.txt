    "the quality and potential practical opportunities for micromechanical devices strongly depend on their dissipative characteristics .",
    "numerous authors have studied the damping of cantilever vibrations both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "there are at least two obvious motivations for these studies .",
    "first , the amount of dissipation determines the sensitivity of cantilever - based devices .",
    "hence , reducing dissipation improves the technical characteristics of the devices .",
    "the second is based on the possibility of probing the dissipative forces which arise due to cantilever - sample interaction in order to obtain a useful information about the sample .",
    "the last idea was a basic one for originating a new direction for atomic force microscopy : noncontact dissipation force microscopy .",
    "( see references @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "many attempts to understand the dissipation mechanisms in cantilevers were undertaken .",
    "the corresponding theoretical models , which could describe cantilever damping , are presented in references @xcite and @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the fundamental nature of damping is still not clear , especially in the case of noncontact cantilever vibrations .",
    "( see , for example , discussions in references @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and @xcite ) . fluctuations of the van der waals force (  vacuum friction \" ) or joule losses are not responsible for the dissipation measured experimentally .",
    "the corresponding friction effects have been calculated in @xcite-@xcite to be many orders of magnitude smaller than those measured in @xcite .",
    "there is not only quantitative disagreement , but also different qualitative behavior .",
    "the point is that both theories predict very strong dependence of damping on the cantilever - sample separation , and this is not consistent with the experimental observations .    a more complex and more specific model , involving adsorbed particles ,",
    "was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the authors connect the large long - range noncontact friction with the electromagnetic interaction of moving charges , induced on the surface of the tip by the bias voltage , with acoustic vibrations in an adsorbate layer on the surface of the sample .",
    "an internal quantum friction due to the presence of a finite number of two - level systems is analyzed in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their analysis is related to millikelvin temperatures which is beyond experimental conditions of @xcite .",
    "the experimental dependence of the friction force , @xmath2 , on the bias voltage , @xmath3 , applied between the tip and a sample , has been found .",
    "it is the quadratic dependence , @xmath4 ( see , for example , references @xcite and @xcite ) that is really typical of the joule mechanism for energy losses . at the same time",
    ", it should be emphasized that not only joule losses , but also a tip - sample attractive forces , caused by electrostatic interactions between closely spaced charged surfaces , behave as @xmath5 . taking into account the fact that the joule mechanism is not effective ( at least for good conductors ) , the increased dissipation may be attributed to some effects of the attractive forces . in this connection , it should be noted that the increase of dissipation with decreasing tip - sample spacing was also obtained in the absence of the electrostatic attraction ( for zero - value bias - voltage ) .",
    "the calculations of @xcite show that at small separations the van der waals ( casimir ) attractive force may become so strong as to be able to modify the cantilever eigenfrequencies .",
    "a very specific attraction of the metal tip to dielectric samples occurs as well .",
    "although overall the dielectric sample is electrically neutral , it may contain localized electric charges , which interact with the corresponding  image \" charges in the tip .",
    "samples of fused silica were used by authors of @xcite to study the effect of charged centers on the cantilever vibrations .",
    "( reference @xcite contains the corresponding theoretical calculations . )",
    "the number of centers has been varied by means of irradiation with @xmath6 rays .",
    "an enhancement of dissipation occurs when the concentration of charged defects increases .",
    "the increasing attractive forces in the above systems are accompanied by the growth of dissipation .",
    "although this force may be of a different physical nature , it always results in an increase in cantilever dissipation .",
    "therefore any consistent theory of dissipation should take into account this circumstance .    concluding the introduction",
    ", we highlight a statistical analysis of various micromechanical systems @xcite that shows that the quality factor ( inverse of dissipation ) usually scales linearly with size .",
    "there is a general tendency of dissipation to increase with the surface / volume ratio , indicating the relevance of the cantilever surface layers to dissipation .",
    "in general , the cantilever motion is described by the oscillator model .",
    "the corresponding equation of motion is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the displacement of the cantilever tip ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the cantilever effective mass and spring constants , respectively . the term @xmath11 is the friction force , which is usually assumed to be proportional to the velocity of the cantilever motion .",
    "hence , this force tends to zero when @xmath12 .",
    "the experiments in @xcite were performed for the cantilever frequency @xmath13 and vibration amplitudes of the order of @xmath14 or less .",
    "this corresponds to the characteristic value of the velocity equal to @xmath15 .",
    "this slow cantilever motion , in practice , excludes dissipation mechanisms due to both joule losses and fluctuations of the van der waals forces .",
    "therefore , it seems to be quite reasonable to consider a velocity - independent friction force , @xmath2 , as the one responsible for dissipation in this case .",
    "the conventional term  velocity - independent force \" means a force which does not depend on the absolute value of the velocity but always acts in the direction opposite to the tip velocity .",
    "thus , @xmath2 reverses its sign after each half - period of vibrations .",
    "this force occurs in mechanical systems in which one solid surface is in contact with another and slides along it .",
    "the friction force is proportional to the effective contact area , which , depends linearly on the compressing force ( the coulomb friction law ) .",
    "a very exotic mechanism of velocity - independent friction due to photon exchange between surfaces which are in close proximity to one another ( but not in a contact ) was predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for the case of a cantilever @xcite whose body has a complex multilayer structure , an internal friction force between the different layers may arise .",
    "the body is a platinum - coated single - crystal silicon beam .",
    "there is also a @xmath16 titanium layer between the @xmath17 platinum  coat \" and the silicon . besides that",
    ", the tip was coated with @xmath18 of gold by evaporation .",
    "it was established experimentally that the dissipation of the platinum - coated single - crystal silicon cantilever is higher by a factor of @xmath19 than that of an uncoated cantilever .",
    "therefore , a muli - layer structure is essential in forming the overall dissipation .",
    "it seems to be reasonable to consider a tip - sample stretching force to be responsible for increasing the contact interlayer area and , consequently , the frictional force , both of which linearly depend on the tip - sample attraction .",
    "the cantilever motion is described by the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "formally , eq .  [ two ] may be rewritten in the form given by eq .",
    "[ one ] , with the coefficient @xmath25 depending on the velocity : @xmath26 the oscillator equation with @xmath25 given by eq .",
    "[ three ] is no longer a linear equation .",
    "nevertheless , it can be easily solved for each time interval between any two successive turning points .",
    "the general solution is given by @xmath27cos(\\omega_0t),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the integer part of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the initial position of the tip .",
    ", are slightly displaced from the values @xmath31 which would correspond to harmonic oscillations . ]",
    "[ four ] describes the decaying motion of the cantilever . in the range of small dissipation ( the energy loss per period is small compared with the total energy @xmath32 ) and small values of time , eq .  [ four ] may be approximated by a simplified formula @xmath33 where @xmath34 the coefficient @xmath35 describes the nonlinear damping of the oscillations , and it depends strongly on the amplitude @xmath36 . as we see , the nonlinearity is the most pronounced for small amplitudes as was observed experimentally @xcite ( at amplitudes of the order of or less than @xmath14 ) . it was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite that this effect vanishes if either the amplitude of oscillation or the tip - sample separation increases .    with the known oscillator trajectory described by eq .",
    "( [ four ] ) , it is easy to estimate the value of nonlinear shift of the oscillation frequency . in what follows we consider the so called  ringdown \" regime of oscillations , which takes place when a drive circuit is abruptly grounded and the cantilever rings down until thermal equilibrium is established .",
    "the value of the cantilever frequency may be obtained by measuring the time interval @xmath37 between two successive crossing points where the displacement @xmath38 is equal to zero .",
    "for our model , these points do not match with the values @xmath39 and @xmath40 as would occur for harmonic oscillations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , but are slightly displaced to greater values of @xmath41 . considering these displacements as small quantities , we can easily obtain the difference @xmath37 .",
    "let us introduce the notation , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ four ] ) two equations for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "they are @xmath46 @xmath47 it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) that @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "then we have @xmath50 the corresponding value of the frequency is given by @xmath51 where the energy of vibrations , @xmath32 , is equal to @xmath52 .    the experimentally observed decrease of the frequency is illustrated in fig . 2d of reference @xcite .",
    "the decrease in the oscillation frequency takes place at the beginning of the transition from high- to small - amplitude regimes of oscillations",
    ". it would be interesting to study experimentally the dependence of the frequency shift on the tip - sample attraction , @xmath53 .",
    "for the case of the coulomb law for the friction force , i.e. when @xmath54 ( @xmath55 are costants ) , the frequency shift is given by the expression @xmath56 when the attraction force is induced by the bias voltage , @xmath3 , @xmath57 . when it is due to localized charges in the dielectric sample , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the concentration of charges .",
    "in both cases the model proposed here can be examined experimentally .",
    "there is an alternative method of calculation of the frequency shift .",
    "it is based on the asymptotic theory of nonlinear oscillations developed by bogolubov and mitropolskii in @xcite .",
    "the direct application of this method to our specific case of a velocity - independent friction force results in a frequency shift which is slightly smaller ( by factor of @xmath60 ) than that given by eq .",
    "[ seven ] .",
    "the details are in appendix a.    so far our analysis assumed a constant friction force .",
    "this force may be considered as originating from many discrete events of energy losses . for brevity",
    ", we will use the term  kick \" for each such event .",
    "the duration of each kick is assumed to be very short compared with the period of vibrations , and the number of kicks per period is large . after averaging over a time interval much shorter than the period of oscillations , but large enough to include many kicks",
    ", the effect of kicks reduces to a constant friction force .",
    "it is evident that the description based on a continuous friction force is applicable to high - amplitude oscillations only .",
    "the discrete nature of the dissipation may reveal itself at small amplitudes when the mean  free path \" @xmath61 is longer than or of the same order as the amplitude .",
    "the correspondence of the two models to each other imposes a relation between the parameters of both @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the energy loss in the course of each kick ( @xmath64 ) .    in what follows",
    ", we consider the case of a low - probability kick per oscillation period .",
    "this is possible when @xmath65 .",
    "if the kick occurs during the motion away from ( towards ) the center , the time of returning to the central position ( @xmath66 ) is decreased ( increased ) .",
    "hence , the period of oscillations is a fluctuating quantity .",
    "it can be shown that these fluctuations result in a positive frequency shift that is in contrast to the case of large amplitudes , @xmath67 .",
    "the following simple analysis makes it possible to obtain the value of the shift in an explicit form . as before ,",
    "we proceed from the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator @xmath68 which describes the vibrations in the absence of dissipation .",
    "initially , the oscillator is in the position @xmath69 .",
    "let us assume that the kick occurs at time @xmath70",
    ". then @xmath71 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 can be expressed via @xmath72 as @xmath73 after this event , the oscillator continues its motion with a modified amplitude @xmath74 , which can be obtained from energy conservation .",
    "it is given by @xmath75 for simplicity , we will consider that @xmath76 .",
    "the modified equation of motion is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the phase variation introduced by the kick .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the new time variable , @xmath79 .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath80 varies from @xmath81 ( the instant of kick ) to @xmath82 ( the instant of crossing the @xmath83 axes ) .",
    "then the overall time required to get to the central position @xmath66 is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85    it follows from eq .",
    "[ ele ] that the time required to reach the center has increased due to the kick .",
    "in contrast , the transit time decreases when the oscillator moves away from the center .",
    "the corresponding time is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 as we see the variation of the transit time depends essentially on the position , @xmath72 , of the oscillator at the instant of kick .",
    "we assume that all realizations of @xmath72 have equal probabilities .",
    "this assumption will make it possible to take into account the contribution of the transit - time fluctuations to the frequency shift .",
    "as before , our following analysis concerns the case of the ringdown experiment .",

    "the period of oscillations , @xmath99 , is defined as @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the frequency of oscillations is given by @xmath101 after statistical averaging of @xmath102 , the linear term @xmath103 vanishes .",
    "this follows from the definitions of @xmath104 and the trigonometry relation @xmath105 .",

    "finally , we get @xmath115    comparing the amplitude dependence of the frequency shift in two limiting cases given by eqs . [ seven ] and [ sixt ] , we may conclude that the function @xmath116 has a minimum at intermediate amplitudes as shown in fig .",

    "our analysis predicts both the increase of the decrement of oscillations and nonmonotonic behavior of the frequency shift when the amplitude decreases .",
