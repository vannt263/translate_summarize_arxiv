    "we show existence of a weak global dissipative solution of the cauchy problem for the two - component camassa  holm ( 2ch ) system with arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1 , given by    [ eq : chsys2a ] @xmath2    with initial data @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the initial data may have nonvanishing limits at infinity , that is , @xmath5 the 2ch system was first analyzed by constantin and ivanov @xcite .",
    "global existence , well - posedness and blow - up conditions have been further studied in a sobolev setting in @xcite and in besov spaces in @xcite . the scalar ch equation",
    "( i.e. , with @xmath6 identically equal to zero ) , was introduced and studied by camassa and holm in the fundamental paper @xcite , see also @xcite , and its analysis has been pervasive .",
    "the ch equation possesses many intriguing properties .",
    "here we concentrate on global solutions for the cauchy problem on the line .",
    "the challenge is that the ch equation experiences blow - up in finite time , even for smooth initial data , in the sense that the @xmath7 norm of the solution remains finite while @xmath8 blows up .",
    "continuation of the solution past blow - up is intricate .",
    "it has turned out to be two distinct ways to continue the solution past blow - up , denoted conservative and dissipative solutions , respectively .",
    "conservative solutions are associated with preservation of the @xmath9 norm , while dissipative solutions are characterized by a sudden drop in @xmath9 norm at blow - up .",
    "this dichotomy has consequences for the well - posedness of the initial value problem as the two solutions coincide prior to blow - up .",
    "here we focus on the dissipative case .",
    "three features are novel in this paper : first of all we include distinct and nonvanishing asymptotics of the initial data , and hence of the solution , at infinity .",
    "since prior work has been on solutions in @xmath9 , this has considerable consequences for the analysis .",
    "secondly , we extend previous results for the ch equation to the 2ch system .",
    "it is not at all clear a priori that the highly tailored construction for the ch equation extends to the 2ch system .",
    "finally , we greatly simplify the analysis of two of us @xcite even in the scalar case of the ch equation with vanishing asymptotics .",
    "one advantage of the present approach is that we can use the same change of variables as in the conservative case , in contrast to the approach chosen in @xcite .",
    "we reformulate the 2ch system in terms of lagrangian coordinates , and in this respect it relates to @xcite for the ch equation .",
    "previous work on the ch equation , covering also the periodic case , includes , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the intricate problems regarding wave breaking can best be exemplified in the context of multipeakon solutions of the ch equation with @xmath10 . for reasons of brevity , and since this example has been discussed in detail in @xcite , we omit the discussion here . for additional theory on multipeakons ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the continuation of the solution past wave breaking has been studied both in the conservative @xcite and dissipative @xcite case . in both cases",
    "the approach has been to reformulate the partial differential equation as a system of banach space - valued ordinary differential equations , and we follow that approach here .",
    "a different approach , based on vanishing viscosity , has been advocated in @xcite .",
    "if we for a moment assume vanishing asymptotics , the dichotomy can be further understood if one considers the associated energy , that is , the @xmath9 norm of the solution @xmath11 for the ch equation . in the case of a symmetric antipeakon - peakon collision ,",
    "the @xmath9 norm is constant prior to wave breaking . at collision time it vanishes , and remains zero for dissipative solutions , while returning to the previous value in the conservative case .",
    "thus we need to keep the information about the energy in the conservative case and this is handled by augmenting the solution with the energy .",
    "more precisely , we consider as solution the pair @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a radon measure with absolute continuous part @xmath14 .",
    "this allows for energy concentration in terms of dirac masses , while keeping the information about the energy . on the other hand , in the dissipative case ,",
    "energy is not preserved , rather it is strictly decreasing at wave breaking .",
    "the extension from scalar ch equation to the two - component 2ch system follows by augmenting the lagrangian reformulation by an additional variable .",
    "let us now turn to a more detailed description of the results in this paper .",
    "first we observe that we can put @xmath10 and @xmath15 since if @xmath16 solves , then @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 will solve with @xmath10 and @xmath15 . note that this only applies since we allow for non decaying initial data at infinity .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath20 .",
    "we reformulate the 2ch system as @xmath21 next we introduce the characteristics @xmath22 , that is , the solution of @xmath23 for a given @xmath11 and initial data @xmath24 .",
    "the lagrangian velocity is given by @xmath25 .",
    "as long as @xmath22 remains strictly increasing as a function of @xmath26 , the solution remains smooth , and , in particular , conservative and dissipative solutions coincide .",
    "thus we introduce the time for wave breaking , or energy dissipation , by @xmath27 we can rewrite the full 2ch system as a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "first define @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 . the function @xmath34 is a smooth increasing function that vanishes for large negative arguments and equals one for large positive arguments .",
    "next we find that the system obeys the following system of ordinary differential equations @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given by and , respectively ( observe the subtle modifications in the dissipative case compared with and , respectively ) .",
    "introduce @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath42 satisfies the system @xmath43 .",
    "the function @xmath44 takes values in a specific banach space @xmath45 , see .",
    "this system poses two challenges : first of all , due to wave breaking , the right - hand side is discontinuous , and thus existence and uniqueness of solutions can not follow the standard path .",
    "this is the key difficulty compared with the conservative case .",
    "secondly , the system possesses a number of additional constraints in order to be consistent with the original eulerian formulation . for example",
    ", we need to make sure that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are satisfied for positive @xmath48 .",
    "we will also need @xmath49 .",
    "this is secured by only using initial data from a carefully selected set that makes sure that all additional requirements are preserved for the solution .",
    "the set is denoted @xmath50 and is given in definition [ def : g ] .",
    "a key result is the proof of global existence of a solution , @xmath51 with initial data @xmath52 , in the lagrangian variables , theorem  [ th : global ] .",
    "next we have to analyze stability of the solution in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the problem here is to identify a metric that separates conservative solutions ( say @xmath53 ) and dissipative solutions ( say @xmath54 ) near wave breaking .",
    "the key is the behavior of the derivative of the characteristics , @xmath40 . at wave breaking @xmath40 vanishes . for dissipative solutions",
    "@xmath40 remains constant for all later times , while for the conservative solutions it becomes positive immediately after .",
    "for conservative solutions , the metric is induced by the euclidean norm of the banach space @xmath45 .",
    "for dissipative solutions , we need a metric which in addition can separate @xmath55 and @xmath56 after collision .",
    "indeed , if we denote by @xmath57 the collision time , the distance between @xmath58 and @xmath59 with respect with this metric has to be big , for any @xmath60 .",
    "this is taken care of by the introduction of a function @xmath61 in definition  [ def : omega ] , and the corresponding metric @xmath62 in definition  [ def : metric1 ] .",
    "the metric yields the flow lipschitz continuous in the sense that @xmath63 for initial data in the set @xmath64 , given by , see lemma [ lem : lip ] .",
    "having obtained the solution in lagrangian coordinates , the next task is to transfer the solution back to eulerian variables @xmath16 .",
    "here we are confronted with relabeling issue ; there are several distinct solutions in lagrangian variables corresponding to one and the same eulerian functions @xmath16 .",
    "this is the reminiscent of the fact that there are many distinct ways to parametrize the graph of a given function .",
    "we identify the functions that give the same eulerian solution , and show that the semigroup in lagrangian coordinates respects the relabeling in the sense that @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the semigroup of solutions and @xmath67 denotes the label .",
    "we define , for any @xmath26 such that @xmath68 ( cf .  theorem [ th : umudef ] ) , @xmath69 we measure the distance between two eulerian solutions by their corresponding lagrangian distance , see .",
    "the interplay between dissipative and conservative solutions is interesting . as shown in @xcite a positive density @xmath70 regularizes the function @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath70 is positive on the whole line , no wave breaking will take place , and conservative and dissipative solutions coincide . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath70 is identically zero , then @xmath11 will satisfy the scalar ch equation , and we will have wave breaking generically .",
    "a local version of this result is that if @xmath70 is positive on an interval , then the solution will remain regular , i.e. , no wave breaking will take place in the interval bounded by the corresponding characteristics . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that one can obtain conservative solutions of the ch equation by considering solutions of the 2ch system with positive density @xmath6 . if one lets the initial density approach zero appropriately , then the solution @xmath11 will converge to the conservative solution of the ch equation .",
    "however , we do show continuity results for dissipative solutions of the 2ch system , cf .",
    "lemmas  [ lemma : kont ] and [ lemma : kont1 ] .",
    "these results are discussed in section  [ sec : stabil ] .",
    "we consider the cauchy problem for the two component camassa  holm system with arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1 , given by    [ eq : chsys2 ] @xmath71    with initial data @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in global solutions for initial data @xmath72 with nonvanishing and possibly distinct limits at infinity , that is , @xmath73 furthermore we assume that the initial density has equal asymptotics which need not to be zero , that is , @xmath74 more precisely , we introduce the spaces @xmath75 where @xmath34 denotes a smooth partition function with support in @xmath76 such that @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 , and @xmath81 subsequently , we will assume that @xmath82    introducing the mapping @xmath83 from @xmath84 into @xmath85 given by @xmath86 for any @xmath87 , yields that any initial condition @xmath88 is defined by an element in @xmath89 through the mapping @xmath90 .",
    "hence we see that @xmath91 is the image of @xmath84 by @xmath90 , that is , @xmath92 .",
    "the linear mapping @xmath90 is injective .",
    "we equip @xmath93 with the norm @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "then @xmath93 is a banach space . given another partition function @xmath96 ,",
    "we define the mapping @xmath97 from @xmath84 to @xmath84 as @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 the linear mapping @xmath101 is a continuous bijection . since @xmath102 we can see that the definition of the banach space @xmath93 does not depend on the choice of the partition function @xmath34 .",
    "the norm defined by for different partition functions @xmath34 are all equivalent .    similarly , one can associate to any element @xmath103 the unique pair @xmath104 through the mapping @xmath105 from @xmath106 to @xmath107 which is defined as @xmath108 in fact @xmath105 is bijective from @xmath106 to @xmath107 , which allows us to equip @xmath107 with the norm @xmath109 where we decomposed @xmath6 according to @xmath110 .",
    "thus @xmath107 together with the norm defined in is a banach space .",
    "note that for smooth solutions , we have the following conservation law @xmath111    moreover , if @xmath112 is a solutions of the two - component camassa  holm system , then , for any constant @xmath113 we easily find that @xmath114 solves the two - component camassa ",
    "holm system with @xmath115 replaced by @xmath116 and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we assume in what follows , that @xmath117 and @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , we only consider the case @xmath10 as one can make the same conclusions for @xmath118 with slight modifications .",
    "in this section we will introduce the set of lagrangian coordinates we want to work with and the corresponding banach spaces .",
    "the 2ch system with @xmath10 can be rewritten as the following system nonzero is simply replaced by @xmath119 . ]",
    "@xmath120    where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are given by @xmath123 and @xmath124    a close inspection of @xmath125 , like in @xcite , reveals that the asymptotic behavior has to be preserved .",
    "thus we write here and later @xmath126 and @xmath127    until wave breaking occurs for the first time every dissipative solution coincides with the conservative one , and hence they can be described in the same way . therefore we summarize the derivation of the lagrangian coordinates and the corresponding system of ordinary differential equations , which describe the conservative solutions here . for details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "afterwards , in the next subsection , we will adapt the system describing the time evolution to the dissipative case .",
    "define the characteristics @xmath22 as the solution of @xmath128 for a given @xmath24 .",
    "the lagrangian velocity is given by @xmath25 and we find using that @xmath129 where @xmath130 is given by @xmath131 where we have introduced @xmath132 the time evolution of @xmath133 is given by @xmath134 where , slightly abusing the notation , @xmath135 is given by @xmath136 last but not least , according to , @xmath137 is preserved with respect to time , i.e. , @xmath138 .      wave breaking for the 2ch system means that @xmath8 becomes unbounded , which is equivalent , in the lagrangian setting , to saying that @xmath40 becomes zero .",
    "let therefore @xmath139 be the first time when @xmath140 vanishes , i.e. , @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
