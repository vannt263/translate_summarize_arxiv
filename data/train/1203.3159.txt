    "one way of characterizing such populations is the distribution of their orbital periods ; however , the estimation orbital periods for extra - galactic xbs is extremely challenging , unless they happen to be at high enough inclinations to exhibit dips and/or eclipses .",
    "the most accessible extra - galactic population for period studies is the m31 x - ray transient group .",
    "these are expected to be low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) with black hole ( bh ) primaries , since the galactic bh lmxbs are nearly all transient @xcite ; transient neutron star lmxbs also exist , but the majority of transients contain bh primaries ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "x - ray and optical observations of these transients allow us to estimate their size , and therefore period , using the methods described below .",

    ", they required a sample with well known distances , and therefore limited the sample to systems exhibiting x - ray bursts with radius expansion , soft x - ray transients and z - sources .",
    "the eddington limit was assumed to be 2.5@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "they found that the optical counterparts to bursters were fainter than those of non - bursters ; this was a first clue that the optical and x - ray luminosities were linked , because bursters tend to have low x - ray luminosities , while the non - bursting z - sources operate near the eddington limit .",
    "furthermore , previous work suggested that @xmath7 was proportional to the orbital period ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this led vpm94 to postulate that the relation between x - ray and optical luminosities ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively ) was caused by x - ray reprocessing in the accretion disk .",
    "the vpm94 toy model suggested that @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the binary separation .",

    "they found that the broadband bvri luminosity ( @xmath24 ) correlated well with @xmath25 over 8 orders of magnitude in @xmath8 for black hole binaries , and also neutron star binaries in the hard state ; the black hole normalization was @xmath010 times higher than the neutron star normalization , consistent with the expectation that black hole systems have larger disks for a given orbital period because @xmath26 is larger for black holes than for neutron stars .",

    "their new empirical relation @xmath27 tends to result in a shorter period than the relation described in equation 1 .",

    "x - ray transient behaviour appears to be governed by thermal - viscous instability in the accretion disc , with hot and cold stable phases , along with an unstable transitional phase ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references within ) .",
    "the outbursts occur when the accretion disc enters the hot stable phase ; however , the resulting x - ray illumination prevents the disc from returning to the cold state until the x - ray luminosity is sufficiently diminished ( * ? ? ? * hereafter kr98 ) .",

    "we were unable to register the chandra positions with the hst observations directly because only a few of the hst fields contained x - ray bright globular clusters .",
    "after refining the positions of the globular cluster in the chandra and lgs b band images with imcentroid , we found the sky co - ordinates of the new positions with xy2sky , then registered the x - ray positions to the lgs b band image using the iraf task ccmap .",

    "the location of each background region was chosen to be near to the source region , but not so close that it might be contaminated by source flux .",

    "we used these lightcurves to determine the overall variability of each x - ray source , and the x - ray luminosity at the times closest to each hst observation .",
    "since we expect our transients to be black hole x - ray binaries in the high / soft state , we initially estimated the conversion from flux to luminosity by assuming a disk blackbody emission spectrum with inner disk temperature k@xmath30 = 1 kev , and @xmath31 = 6.7@xmath32 atom cm@xmath6 ( the galactic line of sight column density ) , then determining the unabsorbed 0.310 kev luminosity equivalent to 1 count s@xmath6 .",

    "the drizzled image is the final product : the flat fielded images are combined , the sky background is subtracted , and cosmic rays are removed ; the image is scaled by intensity ( electron s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the flt images were corrected for instrumental effects ( dark , bias , and flat ) ; however , the sky was not subtracted , and cosmic rays were not removed ; furthermore , the image was scaled to the total number of electrons received over the observation .",
    "we used the drz images to create the difference images described below , but the flt files for photometry since daophot requires an accurate measurement of the sky background .",
    "each drizzled hst observation was registered to the lgs b band image , using the method described in the previous section .",

    "the closest acis observation occurred 1 day before the hst on observation , with 0.310 kev luminosity 3.0@xmath30.2@xmath5110@xmath53 erg s@xmath6 ; given the slow evolution of the outburst , we assume the same luminosity at the time of the hst on observation .      the t11 outburst was significantly detected in 5 acis observations over 54 days .",
    "the decay was well described by an exponential with an e - folding time of 33 days ( @xmath54/dof = 2/5 ) .",
    "we calculated the 0.310 kev luminosity to be @xmath00.34@xmath5110@xmath53 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "the t11 difference image revealed a likely counterpart within the 1@xmath1 ellipse .",
    "we found that b = 24.87@xmath30.09 for the on observation .",
    "we found no trace of a counterpart in the `` off '' observation ; b @xmath3428.2 at the 4@xmath1 level .",
    "hence , we assume that all of the optical light comes from reprocessed x - rays .",
    "t12 was first discussed by @xcite , who identify a counterpart despite the fact that it is brighter in the off observation than in the on observation ; it appears as a black star in fig .",
    "[ difim ] .",
    "we disagree with this interpretation , since there is no scenario where the disc brightens during decay , and instead impose a 4@xmath1 upper limit of b @xmath34 27.9 .",
    "t12 exhibited an apparently double - peaked outburst over @xmath0200 days , with the second peak brighter than the first .",
    "however , the previous observation to include t12 was @xmath0150 days earlier , meaning that the true peak was not observed .",
    "the 0.310 kev luminosity fell from 2.4@xmath30.3@xmath55 to 0.26@xmath30.09@xmath55 erg s@xmath6 over 61.5 days ; if we assume exponential decay , then the 0.310 kev luminosity was @xmath00.9@xmath55 erg s@xmath6 at the time of the hst on observation .",
    "since the e - folding time for transient decay is @xmath02.2 times longer in the optical than in the x - ray lightcurves , the vpm94 and m12 relations only truly apply to the peak of the outburst , and get more inaccurate as the burst evolves .",
    "we made two sets of period calculations for each source : one set estimating the x - ray luminosity of each transient at the time of the hst observation , and one set estimating the optical luminosity at the time of the x - ray peak .",
    "comparison of the two sets of periods indicated the robustness of these estimates .    for t1",
    ", the ns periods agreed within to within 30% , and the bh periods varied by 40% ; the e - folding time was particularly short for this system . for t9",
    "there was a @xmath030% discrepancy between the periods .",
    "for t12 , the periods differed by a factor @xmath03 ; this large discrepancy may be due to the double - peaked nature of the t12 outburst .",
    "the two sets of periods agreed to within @xmath010% for all targets not previously specified .",
    "these results suggest that the observed peaks were generally close enough to the true peaks for the vpm94 and m12 relations to hold .",
    "the periods listed in table  [ translist ] are those obtained by estimating the x - ray luminosity at the time of the hst on observation ; we provide 1@xmath1 uncertainties for systems with identified counterparts , and 3@xmath1 upper limits to the periods for systems with magnitude limits .",
    "we note that some of the transients are rather x - ray faint , suggesting that they are more likely to be in the low / hard state , rather than the thermal high state ; the bolometric luminosities of these sources would then be somewhat higher , leading to shorter periods .",
    "however , most of these systems only have upper limits to the period already ; t11 is the only x - ray faint source with a counterpart .",
    "we note that @xcite fitted the acis spectra of t10 despite their low quality ( @xmath0120 net source counts ) .",
    "they favor power law emission models with n@xmath59 @xmath02@xmath40 atom @xmath41 ; they dismissed disk blackbody emission models because the @xmath31 was below the line - of - sight value instead of fixing @xmath31 . as a result , they found l@xmath60 = 6@xmath55 erg s@xmath6 , and @xmath7 = @xmath41.3@xmath30.5 , both a factor @xmath02 brighter than our values ( see table  [ translist ] ) ; these results give a @xmath0130 hr period , considerably longer than the @xmath050 hr period that we obtained .",
    "however , we checked these spectra and found @xmath31 to be consistent with the galactic line - of - sight absorption , and we prefer the results from our assumed spectral model .      in fig .",
    "[ perdist ] we order the transients by increasing bh period ; the y axis serves to separate them , but does not reflect any physical parameter .",
    "circles and stars represent ns and bh periods respectively , for systems with counterparts ; otherwise , we give the 3@xmath1 upper limits , represented by arrows .",
    "we show the period distribution of 15 milky way bh binaries listed in @xcite for comparison , represented by squares ; the three persistently bright bh hmxbs are excluded .",
    "our period distribution for the m31 transients is similar to that of the galactic bh lmxbs ; however the m31 transients may tend towards shorter periods .",
    "we have not included the period for t8 since its x - ray magnitude did not vary between the hst on and off observations , meaning that our b band magnitude limit was set by the brightest star within the 3@xmath1 positional uncertainty .",
    "this limit is brighter than most of the observed counterparts , and the resulting period limit is not useful . while the x - ray luminosity of t7 did not vary between the hst on and off observations either , the b magnitude limit was fainter than any of the observed counterparts so we have included t7 .",
    "we tested the possibility that the periods of the transients in m31 are consistent with those in the milky way using the tests for univariate data implemented in the asurv package ; this method allows us to compare a censored population , containing some systems with upper limits only , with an uncensored population , where all the values are known , within uncertainties ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the two distributions are inconsistent at the @xmath09298% confidence level . in order to assess the effect of uncertainties on the orbital periods of the m31 systems we repeated the test several times by randomly sampling periods assuming that they follow a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation calculated from the values in table 2 . in all cases the results give very similar confidence levels .",
    "our sample of m31 transients differs from the mw transients at the @xmath02@xmath1 level ; increasing the m31 transient population should amplify this result .",
    "@xcite discovered an enhanced population of x - ray binaries within @xmath0100@xmath29 of the m31 nucleus .",
    "the radial distribution of `` primordial '' , i.e. expected , lmxbs follows the distribution of stellar mass in the galaxy @xcite ; however , the surplus population appears to follow the @xmath61 distribution expected of dynamically formed binaries @xcite .",
    "dynamically formed lmxbs are normally very rare outside globular clusters ; however , @xcite propose that the bulge of m31 is sufficiently large and dense to allow the formation of a significant number of dynamically formed binaries .",
    "however , the stellar velocities in the m31 bulge are @xmath0510 times higher than in globular clusters ; hence @xcite expect only short period binaries to survive , with most of the survivors containing black holes .",
    "since the number of dynamically formed black binaries is strongly dependent on the distance from the center ( @xmath62 ) , one might expect to observe some correlation between orbital period and radial distance for our transients . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ rvp ] we plot @xmath62 vs. @xmath63 for each transient , excluding t8 .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ rvp ] shows f435w ( @xmath0b band ) detection limit for each transient ; t7 lies in a diagonally - shaded region because it showed no x - ray variability between the hst on and off observations , hence the b magnitude was limited by the brightest star within the 3@xmath1 location ellipse rather than the local background .",
    "the sensitivity increased steadily with increasing @xmath62 , varying by 2.5 magnitudes ( i.e. a factor 10 ) .",
    "we employed the cox hazard test and the kendal tau test , both implemented in asurv to deal with bivariate data , to compare the population located 20@xmath29 @xmath2 @xmath62 @xmath2150@xmath29 with the population at 150@xmath29 @xmath2 @xmath62 @xmath2350@xmath29 ; the probability that these two populations were drawn from the same population ( @xmath64 ) is @xmath00.12 . limiting @xmath62 to 300@xmath29 , thereby removing t2 , and re - running the cox hazard and kendal tau tests produces the same result .",
    "by contrast , extending @xmath62 to 400@xmath29 for the second group , thereby including t1 , eradicates any trace of a correlation .",
    "therefore , a more substantial transient population is required to confirm this suspected correlation .",
    "x - ray transients are expected to exhibit exponential or linear decay , depending on whether or not the disc is fully ionized ; this depends on the orbital period and peak x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "hence we used fig . 1 of that paper to determine whether the decays of our targets should be exponential or linear .    with two exceptions ,",
    "all of our targets are expected to exhibit exponential decay ; t7 is consistent with either linear or exponential decay , while t11 should decay linearly according to @xcite .    interestingly",
    "the decay of t11 was definitely more exponential ( @xmath54/dof = 2/5 ) than linear ( @xmath54/dof = 93/5 ) ; we suggest that the true peak luminosity of t11 was considerably higher than the observed peak 0.310 kev peak of @xmath04@xmath5110@xmath65 erg s@xmath6 . the true orbital period of t11 could then be significantly shorter than our estimate of 150@xmath330 hr .",
    "furthermore , the t5 outburst appears to have decayed linearly , even though exponential decay is expected ; no observations were made in the @xmath0170 days prior to the observed outburst , hence we may have caught the linear tail of a longer and brighter outburst .",
    "a brighter peak x - ray luminosity for t5 would mean a shorter period ; however , this would not affect our results , since we only have an upper limit for t5 .",
    "we report new orbital period estimates for 12 x - ray transients observed by chandra and hst . we have identified counterparts to 4 x - ray sources , 2 of those are new to this work ;",
    "we have estimated 4@xmath1 upper limits to the b magnitudes of the remaining 8 systems .",
    "period estimates were previously published for 5 sources ( t1 , t3 , t5 , t10 , t12 ) , using the vpm94 empirical relation @xcite , and noorae et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have already applied the m12 relation to t9 .",
    "we obtained periods that ranged from @xmath20.17 hours to @xmath2175 hours for black hole lmxbs using the m12 relation , and @xmath20.4490@xmath390 hours for neutron star lmxbs using the vpm94 relation .",
    "the m31 transients that we have followed up appear to favor shorter periods than the galactic black hole transients ; if all of our transients contain bhs , then the probability for the m31 and mw binaries being drawn from the same population is @xmath20.08 .",
    "this result may be explained by an excess of x - ray binaries dynamically formed in the high density bulge of m31 ; such systems require short periods to survive @xcite .",
    "however , some of the transients with the shortest periods may contain neutron stars .",
    "we searched for a correlation between the period and distance from the nucleus that would further support the hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "we found a hint of a correlation , at the @xmath090% confidence level .",
    "further observations of m31 transients with chandra and hst will add significance to these relations .",
