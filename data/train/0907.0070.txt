    "extinction of an isolated stochastic population after maintaining a long - lived state is a dramatic phenomenon .",
    "it occurs , even in the absence of environmental variations , because of an unusual chain of random events when population losses dominate over gains .",
    "population extinction risk is a key negative factor in viability of small populations @xcite , whereas extinction of a disease following an epidemic outburst @xcite is of course favorable .",
    "the possibility and consequences of extinction of biologically important components , regulated by chemical reactions in living cells , have also attracted interest @xcite . as stochastic population dynamics are usually far from equilibrium , and no general methods of evaluating large fluctuations are available , they are of much interest to physics @xcite .",
    "this work deals with an isolated single - species population undergoing a set of gain - loss processes .",
    "we will assume that the population is well mixed , so that spatial degrees of freedom are irrelevant .",
    "at the level of the _ deterministic rate equation _ ( henceforth _ rate equation _ ) , which describes the time history of the mean population size @xmath4 and ignores fluctuations , @xmath4 flows to an attracting fixed point , where the gain and loss processes balance each other .",
    "the actual stochastic population , however , behaves differently and ultimately becomes extinct .",
    "this is because , in the absence of influx of new individuals , the empty state @xmath0 is _ absorbing _ : the probability of exiting from it is zero @xcite .    although extinction ( and fluctuations in general ) are beyond its scope , the rate equation is a convenient starting point of our analysis . for an isolated single - species population",
    "the rate equation can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a smooth function determined by the specific gain - loss processes , see below . for generic gain - loss processes @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath8 the fixed point @xmath9 is repelling , whereas for @xmath10 it is attracting . in the former case , the next fixed point @xmath11 of eq .",

    "the mean population size in this case flows to @xmath12 and stays there forever .",
    "when varying the rate constants of the gain - loss processes , the attracting fixed point @xmath12 emerges via a transcritical bifurcation .",

    "when starting from any @xmath14 , the mean population size flows to @xmath15 and , according to the rate equation , stays there forever .",
    "the characteristic bifurcation in this case is saddle - node .",

    "( [ rateeqgen ] ) , is large compared to one . here , prior to extinction , a long - lived probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the population sets in , on a relaxation time scale @xmath29 , around the corresponding attracting fixed point of the rate equation .",
    "this long - lived pdf , however , is metastable : it slowly decays in time .",
    "simultaneously , the probability to find the population extinct slowly grows in time , see e.g. refs .",

    "the main objectives of this work is to accurately , and analytically , calculate the qsd @xmath31 and the mte @xmath34 of a population which experiences quite a general set of stochastic gain - loss processes .",
    "the crux of the method is a dissipative wkb approximation @xcite , where one assumes @xmath35 , treats @xmath3 as a continuous variable and searches for @xmath31 as @xmath36 here @xmath37 is a large parameter which scales as the mean population size in the metastable state .",

    "[ mf]a . in a stochastic description extinction occurs via a large fluctuation which , acting against an effective entropy barrier , brings the population from a vicinity of @xmath1 directly to the absorbing state @xmath0 . in the wkb language",
    "this transition is possible because of the presence of the fluctuational momentum @xmath41 , see fig .",
    "[ figb1 ] .",
    "the attracting and repelling fixed points of the rate equation @xmath12 and @xmath9 , respectively , become hyperbolic fixed points of an extended phase plane @xmath42 . importantly",
    ", an additional hyperbolic fixed point @xmath43 - the fluctuational extinction point - appears here , with a zero coordinate , @xmath0 , but a nonzero momentum @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the most probable path to extinction is the heteroclinic trajectory , directly connecting the  metastable point \" , that is the hyperbolic point @xmath45 , and the  fluctuational extinction point \" : the hyperbolic point @xmath43 .",
    "( such escape trajectories - heteroclinic trajectories with a non - zero momentum - are often called  activation trajectories \" , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    ") this is what we call extinction scenario a.    now let @xmath9 be an attracting fixed point of the rate equation ( [ rateeqgen ] ) , so that the metastable population resides in the vicinity of @xmath2 , see fig .",
    "[ mf]b . in the stochastic description ,",
    "extinction occurs via a large fluctuation which brings the population from a vicinity of @xmath2 to a vicinity of the _ repelling _ fixed point @xmath46 . from there",
    "the system flows into the absorbing state @xmath0  downhill \" , that is almost deterministically . in the framework of wkb theory",
    "the transition from @xmath47 to @xmath46 occurs in the extended phase plane @xmath42 where all three fixed points are hyperbolic , see fig .",
    "[ figb1a ] .",
    "here the optimal path to extinction is composed of two segments : the non - zero - momentum heteroclinic trajectory connecting the hyperbolic fixed points @xmath48 and @xmath45 ( the activation trajectory ) , and the zero - momentum segment going from @xmath1 to @xmath0 ( the relaxation trajectory ) .",
    "this is what we call extinction scenario b.    the mean time to extinction ( mte ) @xmath34 and/or the qsd @xmath31 of metastable single - species stochastic populations were calculated previously in particular examples in different contexts of physics , chemistry , population biology , epidemiology , cell biology , _",
    "etc_. among them there is a large body of work which approximated the master equation by an effective fokker - planck equation , derived via the van kampen system size expansion or related recipes .",
    "once the fokker - planck equation is obtained , the mte and qsd can be calculated by standard methods @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation is in general uncontrolled .",
    "it fails in its description of the tails of the qsd , and gives exponentially large errors in the mte , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite .    with a few exceptions , accurate analytic results for the mte and qsd",
    "are only available for _ single - step _ gain - loss processes : @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) . in this case",
    "the mte can be determined exactly by employing the backward master equation @xcite .",
    "this yields a cumbersome analytic expression for the mte which , for a large population size in the metastable state , can be simplified via a saddle - point approximation . such a procedure was implemented in ref .",

    "in scenario a it suffices to match the recursive solution with the fast - mode solution in their joint region of validity , in much the same way as it was done by kessler and shnerb @xcite in a particular example of three stochastic reactions . in scenario",
    "b the slow mode dominates the wkb - solution at @xmath51 .",
    "it diverges , however , at @xmath1 . to obtain a regular solution there",
    ", one needs to go beyond the wkb approximation and account , in a close vicinity of @xmath1 , for strong coupling between the fast- and slow - mode solutions .",
    "this can be done via the van - kampen system size expansion of the master equation which does hold in the vicinity of @xmath1 .",
    "this procedure was first implemented by meerson and sasorov @xcite , in a model problem of noise - driven population explosion",

    "here is a plan of the remainder of the paper .",
    "section  [ general ] starts with a formulation of the eigenvalue problem for the qsd .",
    "then we expose the wkb approximation and the fast- and slow - mode wkb solutions .",

    "<S> we investigate the phenomenon of extinction of a long - lived self - regulating stochastic population , caused by intrinsic ( demographic ) noise . </S>",
    "<S> extinction typically occurs via one of two scenarios depending on whether the absorbing state @xmath0 is a repelling ( scenario a ) or attracting ( scenario b ) point of the _ deterministic rate equation_. in scenario a the metastable stochastic population resides in the vicinity of an attracting fixed point next to the repelling point @xmath0 . in scenario b there is an intermediate repelling point @xmath1 between the attracting point @xmath0 and another attracting point @xmath2 in the vicinity of which the metastable population resides . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of the theory is a dissipative variant of wkb ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) approximation which assumes that the typical population size in the metastable state is large . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the master equation , we calculate the quasi - stationary probability distribution of the population sizes and the ( exponentially long ) mean time to extinction for each of the two scenarios . when necessary , the wkb approximation is complemented ( i ) by a recursive solution of the quasi - stationary master equation at small @xmath3 and ( ii ) by the van kampen system - size expansion , valid near the fixed points of the deterministic rate equation . </S>",
    "<S> the theory yields both entropic barriers to extinction and pre - exponential factors , and holds for a general set of multi - step processes when detailed balance is broken . </S>",
    "<S> the results simplify considerably for single - step processes and near the characteristic bifurcations of scenarios a and b. </S>"
