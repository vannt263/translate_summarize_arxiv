    "the kelly strategy is attractive to practitioners because of its robust and optimal properties , e.g.  that it dominates any other strategy in the long run and minimizes the time to reach a target , as shown by @xcite , and among others by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it also carries intuitive appeal because of its connection to information theory , which was part of the original motivation in @xcite , and in particular by the fact that optimal investing is one and the same thing as optimal application of the available information ; see @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand , the kelly strategy in its pure unconstrained form , which we will refer to as the ` free kelly ' strategy , generally leads to a too aggressive strategy with too high leverage and risk to be of practical applicability .",
    "real investors are subject to various constraints , and a practical version of the kelly principle can be formulated as : optimize the objectively expected compound growth rate of the portfolio subject to the relevant constraints .",
    "it is in this form that the kelly principle has become increasingly popular among practitioners over the last 20 years or so . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the optimal strategy in this sense , for the particular case where the constraint is in the form of a stop - level .",
    "unlike for most other forms of constraints , the effect of a stop - level on the optimal strategy varies with the portfolio value and with the time remaining until the stop - level is adjusted ( reset ) .",
    "the related problem of finding the growth optimal strategy for a portfolio subject to a drawdown constraint ( a trailing stop - loss rule ) was solved using a combination of hjb and martingale methods by @xcite , see also @xcite and section  [ grossmanzhou ] below .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : moti ] provides some background , and section  [ sec : hjb ] reviews the hjb for the investment problem and introduces notation . in section  [ sec : nonlinpde ] we derive a non - linear pde for the optimal strategy , and in section  [ sec : known ] we consider a few examples with known solutions , and discuss to what extent the equation can be applied . in section  [ koswslr ]",
    "we provide a numerical solution for the kelly strategy subject to a periodically reset stop - loss rule . section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "consider a discretionary portfolio manager running a trading book in a global macro hedge fund .",
    "such a trader is subject to various constraints when selecting the appropriate level of risk to run .",
    "apart from leverage , stress - test and concentration limits and maybe constraints on the asset selection , the book will typically be subject to a value - at - risk ( var ) limit . in practice",
    "most traders will run their book significantly below these limits because there is another kind of constraint : the stop level .",
    "the stop may take several forms .",
    "it is for example common for a book with monthly liquidity to be subject to explicit soft and hard stop levels between liquidity dates . a book with a @xmath0 var limit at",
    "@xmath1 1  day , could for example have a soft stop at @xmath2 mtd ( month - to - date ) where the var limit drops to @xmath3 and a hard stop at @xmath4 mtd where the var limit drops to zero for the remainder of the month . in any given month",
    "the stop - level is a fixed number of percentage points below the portfolio value at the beginning of the month .",
    "any triggered stop will be released and reset after the first coming month - end , where investors will be given a chance to withdraw their funds . hired ( non - partner )",
    "traders managing a relatively small sub - book as part of a larger hedge fund are typically also subject to an explicit terminal stop at around @xmath5 ytd ( year - to - date ) , at which point the book is closed and they lose their job . even founders and senior partners , who may not be subject to any explicit stop levels , will in effect operate under an implicit stop level .",
    "this is due to the fact that if the drawdown from the high - water mark becomes too large , then there will be no performance fees for the foreseeable future to pay for the operation , and the fund is likely to find itself in a downward spiral of brain - drain , investor withdrawals , and lower returns .",
    "the desire to avoid this situation will in effect mean that the fund can only operate at full risk when it is near its high - water mark .",
    "indeed , it has happened more than once that a hedge fund has simply closed after a steep drawdown , only for the managers to open a new fund in a different setting .",
    "history has of course also shown what can happen when a trading operation is run without stops or with unenforceable stops due to illiquidity or management failure .",
    "leaving the moral aspects aside , it is clear that stop - levels , implicit or explicit , are a major part of the constraints limiting the risk in most funds , and that the constraining effect of the stop level scales with the portfolio value and the time remaining until the stop level is reset .",
    "the penalty for hitting the stop is lost opportunity . for a terminal stop",
    "the opportunity cost is potentially infinite since the loss is all future earnings .",
    "a strategy can try to avoid hitting the stop by reducing the risk as the portfolio value approaches the stop level , but in practice it is impossible to guarantee that the stop will not be hit unless the risk is zero . in a model world where the risky assets are modelled using brownian motion , it is possible to avoid hitting the stop by reducing the risk , but this does not mean that there is no opportunity loss . scaling down the risk also scales down potential returns , and increases the amount of time the portfolio end up spending in the vicinity of the stop . thus there is a kind of ` dead zone ' just above the stop level , where the portfolio has very little risk , and it can become virtually stuck . the optimal strategy must find the right balance between scaling the risk down too quickly versus too slowly , foregoing potential returns in both cases . with a terminal stop , or an infinitely long time to reset",
    ", the solution is to effectively ignore the capital below the stop level , and invest in the kelly optimal way as if the capital above the stop level was the total capital . doing this , the trader is only risking the fraction of the capital he can survive to lose .",
    "this strategy which is independent of time , but a function of the portfolio value is discussed in section  [ sec : kwts ] , and the related optimal strategy for a portfolio subject to a trailing maximum drawdown limit is discussed in  [ grossmanzhou ] .    a stop level which resets at the end of each period is more interesting from a practical point of view . with a periodically reset stop - level",
    "the penalty for hitting the stop , or becoming stuck in the dead zone , is less severe , since it is only a temporary loss of opportunity .",
    "if there is only a few days left before the reset , the portfolio value must be very near the stop - level for this to have any effect , but in the other limit where there is a very long time to the reset , the optimal strategy must approach the same strategy as the one for a terminal stop / infinite horizon .",
    "it is therefore clear that an optimal strategy will scale the risk up and down , not only according to how far away the stop is from the current portfolio value , but also according to the time remaining until the stop - level reset .",
    "it is the kelly growth optimal strategy for this problem , discussed in detail in section  [ koswslr ] , which is our main objective .",
    "a realistic modelling of the problem would be very complicated , depend on idiosyncratic details , and is beyond our ambitions in this paper .",
    "instead our goal is to study the optimal strategy in the simplest non - trivial model with a stop - rule .",
    "as it turns out , the resulting strategy , discussed in section  [ koswslr ] , corresponds quite closely to common trader intuition , and can provide a rough guide to the appropriate risk level for practical portfolios .",
    "we use the standard minimal portfolio model consisting of a risky asset displaying geometric brownian motion and an exponentially growing risk - free asset , respectively defined by the evolution @xmath6 with @xmath7 the growth rate and @xmath8 the volatility of the risky asset , @xmath9 the risk - free rate , and @xmath10 the forward looking increment of a wiener process .",
    "a self - financing trading strategy , which invests the fraction @xmath11 in the risky asset and the fraction @xmath12 in the risk - free asset , will result in a portfolio value which evolves according to the equation @xmath13dt + \\alpha\\sigma dw_t.\\ ] ] the analysis can be simplified by introducing the discounted relative portfolio value @xmath14 we can consider @xmath15 to be an index for the portfolio with @xmath16 and with @xmath17 the total return at time @xmath18 as measured in time zero dollars .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath9 is the rate of inflation , it can be considered the real return .",
    "this definition eliminates the constant risk - free drift term @xmath19 from the evolution equation for the discounted portfolio value @xmath20,\\ ] ] where we have indicated that the strategy may depend on the value of the portfolio as well as time .",
    "we are concerned here with problems for which the objective is the maximization or minimization of a terminal ` reward ' function @xmath21 . for a kelly growth optimal portfolio",
    "this would be the period growth rate @xmath22 .",
    "the value function is defined as the expectation of the terminal reward over paths starting from the intermediate point @xmath23 at time @xmath18 , and evolving according to ( [ eq : hjb : dpi ] ) with the optimal control , i.e.@xmath24.\\ ] ] it is significant that we have excluded a consumption type term in the objective , ( a running cost / reward ) , as it would complicate the analysis considerably , but using the methods of appendix  [ app : legendre ] such terms can be handled at least in simple cases ( by adding the equivalent terms to ( [ eq : lt06 ] ) ) .",
    "the value function @xmath25 and the control @xmath11 satisfies the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation @xmath26 which must be solved subject to the final time boundary condition @xmath27 the equations ( [ eq : hjb2])-([eq : hjb2cond ] ) can also be used to find the strategy minimizing the expectation of a terminal objective @xmath21 by replacing @xmath28 by @xmath29 . in either case",
    "the objective function @xmath30 must have a form that makes the problem well - defined . as it stands",
    "the hjb problem defined by ( [ eq : hjb2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hjb2cond ] ) is rather complicated as it involves two unknown functions @xmath25 and @xmath11 linked by a combined pde / maximization equation .",
    "the trick which renders the problem solvable is that under certain conditions we can perform the optimization over the control before solving for @xmath25 , ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the condition is essentially that @xmath25 must have a shape which makes the optimization problem in ( [ eq : hjb2 ] ) have a well - defined solution .",
    "this must be confirmed a posteriori for the actual solution , ( but in many applications it is rather obvious ) .",
    "in essence @xmath25 must be concave for a maximization problem and convex for a minimization problem . according to bellman s principle",
    ", the optimal control must also be optimal over each sub - interval . in the present context",
    "this means that @xmath11 must optimize ( [ eq : hjb2 ] ) at each instant of time .",
    "this is effected by setting @xmath31 , which gives the formal solution @xmath32 substituting this back into ( [ eq : hjb2 ] ) , the control is eliminated resulting in the hjb equation for the value function alone @xmath33 the problem is then reduced to solving ( [ eq : hjb : value ] ) subject to the terminal time boundary condition ( [ eq : hjb2cond ] ) together with any additional boundary conditions ( for example conditions specified on the edges @xmath34 , which could be asymptotic ) .",
    "the standard procedure is thus to start by solving for the value function , and then as the second step to calculate the optimal strategy from ( [ eq : hjb : value : control ] ) .",
    "a hint that ( [ eq : hjb : value ] ) hides a simpler underlying structure is provided by the fact that a legendre transform turns it into a linear second order pde as discussed in appendix  [ app : legendre ] .",
    "it is natural to ask , if there is a pde for the optimal strategy without any reference to the value function .",
    "such an equation would not only be interesting in its own , but would potentially allow us to circumvent the value function , and could have considerable practical benefits . in this section",
    "we show how it is possible to eliminate the value function , and derive a non - linear partial differential equation which is obeyed by the optimal control itself .",
    "the derivation requires that the functions involved are sufficiently smooth in the interior of the domain , but in practice this is not necessarily a great limitation .",
    "the starting point is the hjb for the value function ( [ eq : hjb : value ] ) and the equation for the optimal control ( [ eq : hjb : value : control ] ) .",
    "if we take the hjb equation ( [ eq : hjb : value ] ) together with the equations which follow by operating on it with @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the equation for the optimal control ( [ eq : hjb : value : control ] ) together with the equations which follow by operating on both sides by @xmath37 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then we have a system of seven equations for the unknowns @xmath11 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "our aim is to derive a single equation only involving the stochastic control and its derivatives @xmath11 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . on the surface",
    "it would look like we would need eight equations in order to be able to eliminate the seven derivatives of the value function and still be left with a single equation for the control , but note that the stochastic control as given by ( [ eq : hjb : value : control ] ) only depend on the value function through the ratio between the two derivatives @xmath48 , which means that only six equations are needed to eliminate all the @xmath25 s .",
    "if we start by using four equations to eliminate @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , the three remaining equations can be put in the form @xmath49,\\\\",
    "\\partial_{\\pi}^2 j & = \\frac{(\\mu - r)^2}{2\\sigma^2 }    \\frac{(\\partial_{\\pi } j)^2}{\\partial_t j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this gives us two equations for the ratio @xmath50 , respectively @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows that the optimal strategy must obey the equation @xmath52 this is a non - linear pde which is second order in the portfolio value and first order in time .",
    "the non - linearity is manifested in the @xmath53 factor on the right hand side . like the hjb for the value function",
    ", it must be solved backwards in time from a final time boundary condition . in general the solution",
    "must also obey boundary conditions in the @xmath23-direction which may be asymptotic .",
    "it is reminiscent of a non - linear diffusion equation in reverse time , but it does not strictly have the required structure ( see appendix  [ app : legendre ] ) . the equation is independent of the effective drift rate @xmath54 , but dependency on this quantity may enter via the boundary conditions . since any constant will solve ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) , it is of little use for problems with such a solution .",
    "rather ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) is applicable to problems requiring a non - trivial solution in the sense of an optimal strategy which is a non - constant function of the portfolio value and time .",
    "the second caveat is that we must be able to establish the boundary conditions for the control for example from limit or asymptotic properties which the solution must obey .",
    "for some problems it may not be obvious how to find these boundary conditions in which case it will be necessary to revert to the hjb for the value function .",
    "if , on the other hand , we have a strategy solving ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) , then the corresponding value function can be found from the first order equation ( [ eq : alpha2value ] ) from which it is determined up to a constant .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) can be transformed into different forms which may be more or less convenient for a particular investment problem .",
    "some examples are discussed in appendix  [ app : transf ] .",
    "an explanation for the form of the equation , and the nonlinearity in particular , can be found as follows .",
    "if we describe the optimal strategy by the amount invested in the risky asset rather than by the fraction of the portfolio value , i.e.  using @xmath55 , then the equation takes the form @xmath56 equation ( [ eq : gamma : pde ] ) can also be obtained directly from the legendre transformed hjb problem as discussed in appendix  [ app : legendre ] .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the discounted risky asset price and @xmath58 the discounted bond price as per ( [ eq : model01])-([eq : model02 ] ) and ( [ eq : disc ] ) .",
    "then @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and the discounted portfolio value evolves according to the prescription @xmath61 the process ( [ eq : port : gamma ] ) is self - financing and is a special case of the general self - financing feedback strategy @xmath62 with the self - financing condition @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the number of risky asset shares and @xmath66 the number of risk - free bonds in the portfolio at time @xmath18 . since @xmath60 , @xmath66",
    "does not contribute to the dynamics , but is a slave keeping track of the accounting of the cash generated / needed for the re - balancing @xmath67 . in our case the portfolio ( [ eq : port : gamma ] ) can be decomposed as @xmath68 , with @xmath69 the value of the risky assets , and @xmath70 the value of the risk - free investment . whereas the portfolio @xmath15 is self - financing by construction , the risky asset investment , @xmath71 ,",
    "does not alone represent a self - financing quantity because a general self - financing strategy can redistribute the portfolio freely between @xmath72 and @xmath73 as long as it keeps the sum unchanged . because we are focussing on smooth strategies here , we can link the increment @xmath74 to the increments in the portfolio value , @xmath75 , and time , @xmath76 , via the expansion @xmath77dt",
    "+ ( \\partial_{\\pi}\\gamma)d\\pi_t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows that when @xmath72 represents an optimal trading strategy obeying ( [ eq : gamma : pde ] ) , this reduces to the expression @xmath78 this means that although @xmath72 is not self - financing for a general sub - optimal trading strategy , it will , for the optimal trading strategy , behave as a self - financing quantity with the total increment in @xmath72 ( from market evolution plus re - balancing ) directly proportional to the increment in the portfolio ( which because the portfolio is self - financing is given by market evolution alone ) .",
    "the same holds for the risk - free part of the portfolio which for the optimal strategy obeys @xmath79 .",
    "we note in particular that the nonlinearity of ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma : pde ] ) is a consequence of the feedback nature of the portfolio evolution as specified by equation ( [ eq : port : gamma ] ) , and that the optimal strategy displays a certain balance between the risky and risk - free parts of the portfolio by only redistributing between these in proportion to the total increment in the portfolio .",
    "in this section we comment on the application of the strategy equation ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) to some standard investment problems , where there is a known analytic solution to the hjb equation .",
    "the purpose is to investigate to what degree ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) can be applied with particular focus on the boundary conditions needed .",
    "also [ sec : conststrat ] and [ sec : kwts ] establishes solutions which the optimal strategy in section  [ koswslr ] must approach asymptotically .",
    "the examples have been chosen to illustrate problems where the optimal strategy is respectively constant , [ sec : conststrat ] , value dependent , [ sec : kwts ] , and dependent on both value and time , [ sec : brownestrat ] .",
    "the free kelly strategy is the unconstrained strategy maximizing the period growth rate and can also be interpreted as the strategy maximizing the terminal logarithmic utility , i.e.@xmath80.\\ ] ] the well - known optimal strategy , @xmath81 , is to invest a constant fraction , @xmath82 of the portfolio in the risky asset .",
    "the corresponding value function is given by @xmath83 being constant ( [ eq : kelly : alpha ] ) is a trivial solution to ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) .",
    "a slight generalization of ( [ eq : kellyutil ] ) is the power function utility @xmath84 , with @xmath85 , which is also referred to by the acronym crra for constant relative risk aversion .",
    "the value function for this utility is given by @xmath86 and the corresponding optimal strategy is the constant @xmath87 the free kelly strategy corresponds to the special case @xmath88 , and a fractional kelly strategy , @xmath89 , investing a constant fraction @xmath90 of the free kelly strategy , corresponds to optimizing a power function utility with @xmath91 .",
    "a rational investor would never invest more than the free kelly strategy unless forced to do so by some constraint .",
    "this means that @xmath90 would normally be less than one and @xmath92 therefore negative corresponding to a utility which is capped to the upside .",
    "benchmarked fractional kelly strategies have recently been investigated in detail by @xcite .",
    "if an investor has a critical level @xmath93 below which his wealth must never fall , and therefore can only put at risk the part of his capital exceeding this level , then the capital below the critical level is in effect irrelevant to his utility .",
    "a kelly investor will therefore optimize the growth rate of the capital exceeding the critical level .",
    "this goal is expressed in the value function @xmath94,\\ ] ] with the hjb solution given by @xmath95 the corresponding optimal strategy is @xmath96 this is the unconditional free kelly strategy multiplied by the fraction that the excess capital constitutes out of the total capital . we observe that ( [ eq : kf03 ] ) is a solution to ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) because it is independent of time and obeys @xmath97 .",
    "it is therefore completely defined as the time independent solution to ( [ eq : alpha : pde ] ) subject to the boundary conditions @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "we note that ( [ eq : kf03 ] ) is a ` constant proportion portfolio insurance ' ( cppi ) strategy with the multiplier equal to the free kelly strategy , i.e.  the amount invested in the risky asset is @xmath101 .",
    "more generally we conclude that any time independent optimal strategy must take the form @xmath102 for some constants @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "@xcite , ( see also @xcite ) , have solved the problem of finding the optimal strategy for an investor subject to a maximum drawdown rule for a general class of utility functions .",
    "the essence of their solution can in the present context be stated as follows .",

    "@xcite has shown that the problem of finding the strategy which maximizes the probability of reaching a specified real return target , @xmath112 , in a finite time period , @xmath113 , has the following solution .",
    "as argued by browne , the probability that the target is hit at any time @xmath114 is equivalent to the probability that the terminal wealth hits the target , because once the target is reached the probability maximizing strategy would be to invest exclusively in the risk - free asset .",
    "the value function for this problem is thus defined by @xmath115 with our notation browne s solution to the problem is given by the value function ( with @xmath116 ) @xmath117 and the corresponding optimal strategy is given by @xmath118 with @xmath119 , and with @xmath65 the standard normal density and @xmath120 the corresponding cumulated probability function .",
