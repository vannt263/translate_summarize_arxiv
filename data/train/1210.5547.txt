    "rhic experiments have established the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion collisions at @xmath2gev  @xcite . among the crucial probes showing the presence of the qgp",
    "is jet quenching , measured as the suppression of high @xmath3 hadrons such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "early measurements in @xmath4+au collisions showed the absence of jet quenching in a system where no hot and dense matter is created .",
    "later measurements in au+au collisions revealed that single electrons from heavy flavor decays are suppressed as well at high @xmath3 .",
    "the much larger 2008 @xmath4+au data now allow further study of the initial state of heavy - ion collisions , especially concerning the centrality dependence of such effects .",
    "the data also allow the reconstruction of jets in phenix and the measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as well as of heavy - flavor electrons up to significantly higher @xmath3 .",
    "initial state effects in heavy - ion collisions include the so - called cronin enhancement  @xcite , a broadening of the transverse momentum distribution of particles compared to the @xmath5+@xmath5 baseline , modifications of nuclear parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , or the possible formation of a color glass condensate .",
    "recently , centrality dependent nuclear pdfs , eps09s and eks98s , were published  @xcite .",
    "they are an extension of the prior eps09 and eks98 nuclear pdfs with an impact parameter dependence included ( based on the @xmath6 dependence of those pdfs ) .",
    "they predict a small dependence of the nuclear modification factor in @xmath4+au and @xmath5+au on the collision centrality .",
    "the results presented in these proceedings are from the analysis of the 2008 @xmath4+au data taken by phenix central spectrometer .",
    "phenix sampled 80nb@xmath7 during that run , a factor of 30 increase over the 2003 @xmath4+au data set .    the centrality determination is a common , crucial component to all analyses presented here .",
    "the collision centrality was determined using the charged multiplicity in forward rapidity @xmath8 , as measured with the phenix beam - beam counter .",
    "here , forward ( positive ) rapidity is defined as the au - going side . the underlying average number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath9 )",
    "was estimated with a glauber model monte carlo simulation .    due to the autocorrelation between having a high @xmath3 particle in the central phenix spectrometer and the charge multiplicity in the bbc , an additional correction factor is calculated .",
    "this is done with the same glauber monte carlo simulation used for the calculation of @xmath10 .    , for @xmath0 ( dots ) , reconstructed jets ( squares ) , and @xmath1 ( circles ) .",
    "the boxes show the same systematic uncertainties as in figure  [ fig : rda ] . ]    , for @xmath0 ( dots ) , reconstructed jets ( squares ) , and @xmath1 ( circles ) .",
    "the boxes show the same systematic uncertainties as in figure  [ fig : rda ] . ]",
    "the analysis method for @xmath0 and @xmath1 is based on the earlier phenix approach used for the 2003 data  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath3 reach of this analysis is significantly higher , the merging of the electromagnetic showers from the two @xmath0 decay photons has to be taken into account .",
    "such showers are removed by a shower shape cut .",
    "the probability for this loss of @xmath0 in the data sample was estimated with a fast monte carlo program that takes into account the shape of the electromagnetic showers of the decay photons .",
    "the jet analysis uses the gaussian filter algorithm  @xcite that was developed in the analyses of @xmath5+@xmath5 and cu+cu data in phenix .",
    "the algorithm is a seedless cone - like algorithm with gaussian weighting on the angle with respect to the jet axis .",
    "it is an infrared- and collinear - safe algorithm that was developed for heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it focuses on the energetic core of the jet and optimizes the signal to background ratio . the small underlying event present in @xmath4+au collisions",
    "was evaluated with embedding studies . for the data shown here , the fake rate was determined to be smaller than 5% .",
    "phenix has measured the spectra of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) for @xmath3 up to 20 ( 22 ) gev/@xmath11 .",
    "since the decay photons of the @xmath1 have a larger separation due to the larger mass of the parent particle , the @xmath1 could be measured up to higher @xmath3 than the @xmath0 , despite its smaller production cross section and smaller two - photon branching ratio .",
    "the jet spectra were measured for 9 gev/@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath3 @xmath12 45 gev/@xmath11 .",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath13 , is then calculated for each of the three final states , x , as @xmath14    @xmath13 is shown in figure  [ fig : rda ] for four centrality selections , for @xmath0 , jets , and @xmath1 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties shown are ( in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 case ) mostly due to using a @xmath5+@xmath5 baseline from a different rhic run with an independent energy calibration of the calorimeter .",
    "the @xmath3-correlated systematic uncertainties are mostly correlated between @xmath0 and @xmath1 while they are uncorrelated between the mesons and the jet measurement . in central events , high @xmath3 jets",
    "appear slightly suppressed , with @xmath15 , and the @xmath0 and @xmath1 show consistent behavior . in peripheral events , however , all three probes are enhanced compared to @xmath5+@xmath5 collisions .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the observation in an older phenix measurement  @xcite .",
    "however , the old data lack statistical significance at high transverse momenta .    another way to look at the centrality dependence is the ratio of the yield in more central collisions to the yield in the most peripheral collisions , @xmath16 .",
    "the advantage is that common systematic uncertainties cancel , especially the uncertainty of the energy scale of the detector .",
    "the centrality evolution of @xmath16 is shown in figure  [ fig : rcp ] . here , due to the slight suppression in central collisions and the clear enhancement in peripheral collisions ,",
    "a strong centrality dependence is observed , with @xmath17 at high @xmath3 .",
    "( dots ) with a centrality dependent eps09 calculation , for peripheral ( top ) and central ( bottom ) collisions .",
    "the boxes show the same systematic uncertainties as in figure  [ fig : rda ] . ]",
    "( dots ) with a centrality dependent eps09 calculation , for peripheral ( top ) and central ( bottom ) collisions .",
    "the boxes show the same systematic uncertainties as in figure  [ fig : rda].,scaledwidth=94.0% ]    a comparison of the @xmath0 data with the eps09s npdfs is shown in figure  [ fig : eps09scomp ] , both the 2003 and the new 2008 data are plotted to illustrate the agreement .",
    "it shows a good agreement in central @xmath4+au collisions , while in peripheral collisions , the data and the eps09s prediction are different .",
    "it is not clear , however , if the centrality definition and possible biases due to the aforementioned auto correlation are treated the same way in the data and in eps09s .",
    "recently , phenix has measured centrality - dependent single electron spectra and @xmath13 from heavy - flavor decays  @xcite . for this measurement , all electrons from other sources such as @xmath0 dalitz decay , decays of other light mesons that do not carry charm or beauty , and quarkonia are subtracted from the overall electron sample .",
    "a striking observation was an enhancement in the region of about 1gev/@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath3 @xmath12 5gev/@xmath11 . in figure",
    "[ fig : singleel ] , the single electron @xmath13 is compared with a calculation using eps09 for the npdf modification , where the centrality dependence is included through the integrated longitudinal density of the au nucleus ( see  @xcite ) . the calculation is based on pythia  @xcite input spectra . here , in peripheral collisions , the prediction from eps09 agrees with the data while it is in disagreement in the enhancement region in central collisions .",
    "however , the calculation does not include @xmath18 broadening from parton scattering in the nucleus which would be expected to lead to an enhancement in this @xmath3 region .",
    "phenix has measured the centrality dependence of the spectra and the nuclear modification factor in @xmath4+au collisions at @xmath19gev , for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , reconstructed jets , and single electrons from heavy - flavor decays .",
    "the jet measurement shows the same trend in centrality dependence as the measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is expected if the high @xmath3 hadrons are leading fragments from jets . with the current centrality definition ,",
    "a strong centrality dependence is observed , where @xmath13 is slightly suppressed ( @xmath15 ) in central collisions and significantly enhanced ( @xmath20 ) in peripheral collisions .",
    "this behavior is not explained by centrality dependent nuclear pdfs such as eps09s .",
    "further studies are necessary to understand if this new phenomenon comprises new physics effects in the nucleus or indicates potential bias in events which include detected jets or very high pt particles .",
    "electrons from heavy - flavor decays are modified in central @xmath4+au collisions , for 1gev/@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath3 @xmath12 5gev/@xmath11 , this enhancement disappears in peripheral collisions .",
    "this observation is in the region where cronin enhancement might be present also for heavy quarks .",
