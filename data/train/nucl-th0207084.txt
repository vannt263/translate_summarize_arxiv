    "theoretical studies of dynamical self - energies in @xmath0 nuclei , predicting rather strong contributions from the coupling of the @xmath0 to excitations of the nuclear core , point in a similar direction @xcite .",
    "this , however , is not fully complying with recent observations of well separated and relatively sharp @xmath0 single particle structures in the medium - mass @xmath5v and @xmath6y hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the measured spectra are compatible with a much stronger spin - orbit strength than expected from the low mass region , amounting to spin - orbit interaction energies of 1 to 2 mev , but the data do not indicate a strong damping of the @xmath0 single particle states .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn from these - partly conflicting - findings is that there is a clear necessity for more precise measurements and an enlarged body of data . for more decisive results on @xmath0-nucleus interactions",
    "medium and heavy mass nuclei can be expected to be much better suited . in light nuclei threshold effects from the weak binding of @xmath0 states and finite size effects contribute strongly to the observed spin - orbit splitting , thus not giving direct access to the wanted information on the genuine @xmath7 interaction strengths @xcite .",
    "the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that these effects decrease rapidly beyond the silicon mass region .",
    "a standard tool for spectral investigations is @xmath8-spectroscopy , detecting the photons from the hypernuclear transitions of the @xmath0 particle after it was created in an excited state e.g. in a @xmath9 reaction . in a recent @xmath10 experiment on @xmath11c at bnl",

    "the hypernuclear auger effect is the direct de - excitation of an excited @xmath0 single - particle state in a hypernucleus by the emission of a neutron .",
    "the process is analogous to the well known atomic auger effect where the de - excitation of an electron kicks out another less bound one . in the case of the hypernuclear auger effect",
    "the energy spectrum of the emitted neutrons reflects the @xmath0 singe - particle level structure , but folded with the neutron single - particle spectrum .",
    "the mechanism of the hypernuclear auger effect is schematically shown in figure  [ fig : auger_scheme ] . in order to occur",
    "the separation energy of at least the @xmath0 1s - orbit must be larger than the separation energy of the valence neutron .",
    "therefore , because of the much weaker @xmath0 binding , the hypernuclear auger effect appears with a strength sufficient for measurements only in intermediate and heavy mass nuclei where neutron and @xmath0 separation energies of comparable magnitude are available .",
    "already from this simplified picture it is clear that a single transition of the @xmath0 will yield a wealth of peaks in the neutron s energy distribution , requiring a very careful analysis . for the proposed jlab experiment @xcite a neutron energy resolution of better than 50 kev",

    "for the present application we need information on knocked - out , unbound neutron states . for that purpose",
    "the single particle continuum was discretized by enclosing the system in a huge box of size @xmath64 .",
    "since the spacing of the discretrized continuum levels behaves as @xmath65 the use of such a large quantization volume ensures quasi - continuous energy spectra for the neutron scattering states , allowing to resolve single particle resonances and other continuum structures resulting from the calculations .",
    "the continuum wave functions are calculated in the self - consistently obtained ground state mean - field potentials .",
    "thus , final state interactions are taken into account on the level of static mean - field self - energies .",
    "the approach assures orthogonality of bound and unbound wave functions thus avoiding the unphysical non - orthogonality contributions inherent to phenomenological approaches .",
    "since the previous applications of the ddrh theory show that the experimental @xmath0 spectra are reproduced especially accurate in heavy nuclei our approach is well suited for the calculation of the auger neutron spectra from @xmath1pb .",
    "numerical values of the single particle energies for occupied neutron states and bound @xmath0 states are displayed in table  [ tab : single - particle - energies ] .",
    ".ddrh results for @xmath0 and neutron single particle energies in @xmath1pb entering into the auger - calculations .",
    "the standard set of interaction parameters was used @xcite . [ cols=\"<,>,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     because of the high level density and moderate separation energies heavy hypernuclei are most suitable for the auger effect .",
    "however , at the same time these apparent advantages are , unfortunately , a potential source of problems for experimental work .",
    "the huge amount of combinatorial possibilities for transitions , illustrated in table  [ tab:1g - trans ] and indicated in figure  [ fig : auger-1g - levels ] for the case of initially populating the @xmath66-shell in @xmath1pb , leads to auger spectra of a rather complicated shape making in many cases an unambiguous identification of transitions and assignment of quantum numbers almost impossible .",
    "the problem is apparent from figure  [ fig : full - spec ] where the complete neutron emission spectrum from the @xmath67 hypernucleus is displayed , summed over all energetically open @xmath0 levels .",
    "experimentally , spectra of a similar structure have to be expected .",
    "in addition , state - dependent weighting factors from the production vertex of the initial @xmath0 state will be superimposed . from figure  [ fig : full - spec ] and figure  [ fig : auger-1g - levels ] it is obvious that experiments will be confronted with spectra of high complexity . before observables of physical interest can be accessed the data will have to be analyzed in a more selective approach . from the discussion it is obvious that much of the structure will be produced by incoherent superpositions of contributions from the variety of orbitals in which the @xmath0 was inititally produced . by a precise energy tagging of the produced kaon and the outgoing electron ( for the case of electromagnetic production of hypernuclei , as will be the case at jlab ) it might be possible to determine the initial @xmath0-state accurately enough and that only the auger - neutrons related to the de - excitation of that specific state can be recorded selectively in a coincidence measurement .     with an initial 1f @xmath0 state . ]    in this context , it is of interest to consider the auger transitions on the limits of the energetically accessible range of states .",
    "assuming energetically sharp states , i.e. the @xmath0 and neutrons are in good quasiparticle configurations and damping effects are negligible , the present calculation predicts that the auger process can only take place if the @xmath0 initially is produced in the @xmath68-orbit or above ( see table  [ tab : single - particle - energies ] ) , because otherwise the @xmath0 transition energies are less than the lowest neutron separation energy . next to the @xmath68-orbit we find the doublet of @xmath69 states which is of interest because it allows to observe the @xmath0 spin - orbit splitting , at least in principle . since the energy window available from populating the @xmath69-orbits is still rather narrow the resulting auger neutron spectrum is of a comparatively simple structure . in figure  [ fig:1f - spec ] results for the auger spectra produced by the @xmath70 and",
    "@xmath71 states are compared .",
    "it is seen that in both cases only a small number of final states occurs .",
    "even more , only the transitions to the @xmath72 neutron - hole final state yield a significant strength .",
    "thus it is even possible to clearly obtain the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath69-shell .",
    "the prominent strength of this doublet is also fairly model independent .",
    "considering the kinematically allowed phase space of this transition only , one might expect that wave function effects which are sensitive to the details of the interaction could strongly influence the relative strengths between the emission of the @xmath73- or @xmath74-shell neutrons , which are in energy almost degenerate ( see table  [ tab : single - particle - energies ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , due to the high degeneracy of the @xmath72 neutron - orbitals the multiplicity of these neutrons will be greatly enhanced .",
    "therefore one can expect to observe in the de - excitation spectrum of a @xmath69-state a clear line doublet belonging to the two spin - orbit partners of the @xmath69 shell falling down to the 1s orbital and thereby knocking out the @xmath72 neutron .",
    "single particle energy spectra in @xmath1pb for the three different sets of coupling constants discussed in the text . ]     shell for interactions with different spin - orbit splittings .",
    "the auger transition widths @xmath75 are shown as functions of energy @xmath76 of the outgoing neutron .",
    "the upper and lower arrows indicate transitions from the 1g@xmath77 to the 1p@xmath78 and 1p@xmath79 final states , respectively . ]",
    "the general case is , however , more ambiguous .",
    "the doublet structure which one might expect as the signature of the @xmath0 spin - orbit splitting does not always show up in the spectral distribution since in many cases the matrix elements depend sensitively on binding energies and other wave function effects . as a representative case , we study the influence of the spin - orbit interaction strength on the auger neutron spectra in more detail for the @xmath66 shell .",
    "this case is well suited , since the spin - orbit splitting is sufficiently large and the spectrum offers already some complexity .",
    "the possible transitions for this configuration together with the corresponding transition rates are shown in table  [ tab:1g - trans ] .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath66-shell spectra on variations of the spin - orbit strength of the @xmath0-nucleus potential is investigated by changing the relative and the absolute coupling strength of the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 meson to the @xmath0 , keeping the overall single particle structure of the @xmath0 spectrum fixed .",
    "numerically , this is realized by observing that in our relativistic mean - field theory with scalar and vector self - energies @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , the leading order non - relativistic schroedinger - type central potential is given by @xmath82 and the strength of the spin - orbit potential is determined by @xmath83 .",
    "hence , we can relate spectral effects from variations of the spin - orbit strength by a factor c to a scaling of the scalar and vector self - energies @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , according to @xmath84 we preserve the self - consistency between the nuclear mean - field and the underlying baryon - baryon interactions by scaling the @xmath2 and @xmath3 vertices , equation  ( [ eq : pot ] ) , by the same factors @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "choosing @xmath87 as our external parameter and using always @xmath88 as a constraint , the spin - orbit splittings of the @xmath0 levels can be varied over wide ranges while keeping the changes in the overall structure of the @xmath0 single particle spectrum on a minimal level .",
    "the @xmath0 single particle spectra obtained for @xmath89 ( corresponding to @xmath90 , respectively , ) are compared to the results for @xmath91 in figure  [ fig : coupling - comp ] . for @xmath92",
    "the spin - orbit splittings are reduced by about a factor of 2 and an increase of about the same size is found for @xmath93 .",
    "these ( strong ) variations will surely cover the full range of uncertainties about the @xmath0 spin - orbit potential .",
    "the spectral distributions of auger transitions widths @xmath75 , obtained by putting the initial @xmath0 in @xmath94 orbits are displayed in figure  [ fig : coupling - comp ] .",
    "compared to the standard case @xmath91 the spectral structures and transition strengths are changed drastically when using @xmath92 and @xmath93 . as an overall feature",
    "the calculations show a concentration of strength in a few states for @xmath91 and @xmath93 while a more equilibrated distribution is found for @xmath92 .",
    "the apparent pile - up of strength at low neutron energies for the normal and strong coupling cases are related to the variations in the values of overlap matrix elements due to changes in binding energies and single particle wave functions . analyzing the dynamical content of the response functions by calculating sum rules for various moments of the excitation energy one finds a disappointing small sensitivity on the spin - orbit interaction strength .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that spin - orbit effects will contribute significantly and on an observable level to the total spectral strength .",
    "on the level of individual transitions there are , however , signals for spin - orbit effects visible . in figure",
    "[ fig : coupling - comp ] the transitions @xmath95 are indicated by the upper arrows while lower arrows denote @xmath96 .",
    "the length of the arrows corresponds to the @xmath97 energy splitting which obviously depends directly on the spin - orbit interaction strength .",
    "in addition , details of the spectral distributions , e.g. the clustering of strength in certain energy regions , also depends on the overlap of wave functions by which the transition matrix elements and therefore the transition widths @xmath75 are determined ( see equations  ( [ eq : differential - width2 ] ) and ( [ eq : mat_el ] ) ) .",
    "it might seem somewhat disadvantageous to start out doing auger experiments with a system of the complexity of a heavy nucleus like lead .",
    "however , aiming at resolving the @xmath0 spin - orbit structure in heavy hypernuclei , which is still a controversial question as was mentioned in the introduction , one needs to find hypernuclei that provide a core nucleus of very low spin . in the ideal case",
    "this should be j@xmath98 in order to eliminate - or at least to suppress - effects from @xmath0 angular momentum - core nucleus spin interactions leading to an additional splitting superimposed on the pure @xmath0 spin - orbit splitting . in this respect the frequently used @xmath99y and @xmath100v hypernuclei are very unfavorable cases because the @xmath101y and @xmath102v core nuclei carry ground state spins of 4@xmath103 and 6@xmath104 , respectively !",
    "the broadening of the l - orbits observed in these nuclei [ 1 ] does not exhibit a proper @xmath105 systematics which might be related to contribution from residual interactions involving the huge core spins [ 25 ] .",
    "hyperisotopes matching the requirements of having a 0@xmath104 core ground state and appearing with at least around 10% natural abundancy would be @xmath106zr and @xmath107sn .",
    "lighter isotopes will gradually cease to exhibit auger de - excitations .",
    "the auger - neutron transition rates for the de - excitation of single @xmath0 hypernuclei on the example of @xmath1pb have been calculated in relativistic ddrh theory .",
    "the initial state was represented by a ground state @xmath108pb core with an attached @xmath0 single particle state , the final state as a neutron particle - hole excited @xmath108pb where the @xmath0 hyperon occupies a lower lying single particle level and the neutron of the particle - hole pair being unbound .",
    "hence the process corresponds to a decay of the initial single @xmath0 configuration into a @xmath0-neutron - particle - hole configuration .    due to the fact that the hypernuclear auger effect appears mainly in heavy and intermediate mass hypernuclei",
    "the spectral distribution of the emitted neutrons is extremely complex .",
    "for this reason a very detailed reconstruction of each event will have to be done in possible experimental measurements . by focusing on initial states with the @xmath0 in the @xmath69-orbit",
    "our calculations predict a clean doublet structure in the auger neutron spectrum from which the @xmath69 spin - orbit splitting can be directly read off , assuming sufficient energy resolution . for a general @xmath0 orbit no definite signature of the spin - orbit",
    "splitting will appear due to the huge amount of transitions and the additional broadening of peaks when deeply bound neutrons are involved .",
    "the effect of a finite width of the neutron states , increasing with the distance from the fermi - surface has not been considered in our calculations .",
    "for the least bound neutrons it will have almost no effect , but going deeper in binding energy the broadening of the states can no longer be neglected . as described in the previous paragraphs the neutron spectra in which the deeply bound neutrons are also involved",
    "are already fairly complex .",
    "an additional broadening of the neutron levels will thus wash out most of the spectral structure there .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath69-shell de - excitation only the valence neutrons close to the fermi - level are involved so that the spin - orbit splitting signal is going to survive in realistic spectra .    for the spectroscopy in the intermediate and heavy mass region the hypernuclear auger effect provides a promising complementary tool to @xmath8 spectroscopy , although special care must be taken on the choice of transitions and tagging the energy . for the @xmath1pb hypernucleus",
    "the @xmath69 shell is such a well suited case",
    ". this technique might be the only way to achieve high resolution information on the hypernuclear fine structure in heavy nuclei since for @xmath8 transitions it will be even harder to assign the detected photons to specific transitions .",
