    "<S> al . _ , 2010 )    in addition to the above large scale effects there are issues on galactic scales ( missing satellites problem ( klypin _ et . </S>",

    "<S> the cusp / core nature of the central density profiles of dwarf galaxies ( gentile _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _ , 2004 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> three of the above five large scale puzzles are large scale effects related to preferred cosmological directions ( cmb multipole alignments , qso polarization alignment and large scale bulk flows ) which appear to be not far from each other ( antoniou & perivolaropoulos , 2010 ) . their direction is approximately normal to the axis of the ecliptic poles @xmath30 and lies close to the ecliptic plane and the equinoxes . </S>",
    "<S> this coincidence has triggered investigations for possible systematic effects related to the cmb preferred axis but no significant such effects have been found ( copi _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _ , 2010 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it has been shown recently ( antoniou & perivolaropoulos , 2010 ) that the union2 snia data hint towards a direction of maximum accelerating expansion that is abnormally close to the directions of the above preferred axes . in table 1 </S>",

    "<S> it is straightforward to show ( antoniou & perivolaropoulos , 2010 ) that the probability of such proximity among axes directions that should be independent of each other is less than @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , unless there is a hidden common systematic ( peiris & smith , 2010 ) , the existence of a cosmological preferred axis may be attributed to physical effects . </S>",
    "<S> an incomplete list of these effects is the following :    * an anisotropic dark energy equation of state ( zumalacarregui _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , 2010 ; koivisto & mota , 2006 ; battye & moss , 2009 ) due perhaps to the existence of vector fields ( armendariz - picon , 2004 ; esposito - farese , pitrou & uzan , 2010 ) . </S>",
    "<S> * dark energy and/or dark matter perturbations on scales comparable to the horizon scale ( rodrigues , 2008 ; jimenez & maroto , 2009 ) . for example </S>",
    "<S> an off center observer in a 1gpc void would experience the existence of a preferred cosmological axis through the lemaitre - tolman - bondi metric ( alexander _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _ , 2009 ; garcia - bellido & haugboelle , 2008 ; dunsby _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _ , 2010 </S>",
    "<S> ; garfinkle , 2010 ) . </S>",
    "<S> * turbulent structure formation could also lead to large scale non - gaussian features which would lead to the existence of a preferred axis ( schild & gibson , 2008 ) . * deviations from the isotropic cosmic expansion rate induced by a fundamental violation of the cosmological principle eg through a multiply connected non - trivial cosmic topology ( luminet , 2008 ) , rotating universe coupled to an anisotropic scalar field ( carneiro & mena marugan , 2001 ) , non - commutative geometry ( akofor _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _ , 2008 ) or simply a fundamental anisotropic curvature ( koivisto _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _ , 2011 ) . </S>",
    "<S> * statistically anisotropic primordial perturbations ( armendariz - picon , 2007 ; pullen & kamionkowski , 2007 ; ackerman , carroll & wise 2007 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , inflationary perturbations induced by vector fields ( dimopoulos _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _ , 2009 ; bartolo _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . _ , 2009 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note however that inflationary models with vector fields usually suffer from instabilities due to the existence of ghosts ( himmetoglu , contaldi & peloso , 2009 ) . </S>",
    "<S> * the existence of a large scale primordial magnetic field ( kahniashvili , lavrelashvili & ratra , 2008 ; barrow , ferreira & silk , 1997 ; campanelli , 2009 ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for such a magnetic field has recently been found in cmb maps ( kim & naselsky , 2009 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the confirmation of the existence of a cosmological preferred axis would constitute a breakthrough in cosmological research . given the present status of cosmological observations such </S>",
    "<S> a confirmation is one of the most probable directions from which new physics may emerge .    </S>",
    "<S> given the preliminary evidence for anisotropy discussed above , it is important to extend and intensify efforts for the possible confirmation of this evidence . </S>",
    "<S> such confirmation may be achieved by extending the snia compilations towards larger datasets and deeper redshifts that span as uniformly as possible all directions in the sky . </S>",
    "<S> this is important in view of the fact that the union2 compilation is less uniform and detailed in the south galactic hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> in addition it is important to extend other cosmological data related to cmb low multipole moments , bulk velocity flows and quasar polarization to confirm the present existing evidence for preferred axes in these datasets . </S>",
    "<S> finally , alternative probes of cosmological anisotropies may be considered like higher cmb multipole moments , non - gaussian features and polarization in the cmb maps , alignments of geometric features of various structures on large scales ( there is already some preliminary evidence for alignment of handedness of spiral galaxies ( longo , 2009 ) along an axis not far from the directions of the other preferred axes of table 1 ) , alignment of optical polarization from various cosmological sources or studies based on cosmic parallax ( quartin & amendola , 2010 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to derive observational signatures that can clearly distinguish between the various different origins of the preferred axes .    </S>",
    "<S> * ackowledgements : * i thank the organizers of the new directions in modern cosmology workshop for inviting me . </S>",
    "<S> i have enjoyed many interesting discussions with the participants and the organizers especially with rick watkins , ruth durrer and rudy schild . </S>"
