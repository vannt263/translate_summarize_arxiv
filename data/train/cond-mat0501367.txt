    "ever since the proposition , in 1988 , by tsallis @xcite , @xcite of a nonextensive generalization of the canonical formalism of statistical mechanics a spirited discussion @xcite , @xcite has grown on the foundations of this branch of physics .",
    "but , only until recently @xcite-@xcite has there appeared firm evidence about the relevance of the generalized formalism for specific model system situations .",
    "these studies present rigorous results on the dynamics associated to critical attractors in prototypical nonlinear one - dimensional maps , such as those at the pitchfork and tangent bifurcations and at the accumulation point of the former , the so - called onset of chaos @xcite . as these are very familiar and well understood features of these maps",
    "it is of interest to see how previous knowledge fits in with the new perspective .",
    "also , clear - cut calculations may help clarify the physical reasons ( believed in these examples to be a breakdown in the chain of increasing randomness from non - ergodicity to completely developed chaoticity ) for the departure from the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics and the competence of the non - extensive generalization .",
    "here we review briefly specific results associated to the aforementioned states in unimodal maps which are all characterized by vanishing lyapunov coefficients .",
    "we also recall how the dynamics at the tangent bifurcation appears to be related to that at thermal critical states .",
    "in addition , time evolution at the noise - perturbed onset of chaos is seen to be closely analogous to the glassy dynamics observed in supercooled molecular liquids .",
    "as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite the long - known @xcite exact geometric or _ static _ solution of the feigenbaum renormalization group ( rg ) equations for the tangent bifurcation in unimodal maps of nonlinearity @xmath0 also describes the _ dynamics _ of iterates at such state .",
    "a straightforward extension of this approach applies also to the pitchfork bifurcations .",
    "we recall that the period - doubling and intermittency transitions are based on the pitchfork and the tangent bifurcations , respectively , and that at these critical states the ordinary lyapunov coefficient @xmath3 vanishes .",
    "the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath4 was determined analytically and its relation with the rate of entropy production examined @xcite .",
    "the fixed - point expressions have the specific form that corresponds to the temporal evolution suggested by the nonextensive formalism .",
    "these studies contain the derivation of their @xmath1-generalized lyapunov coefficients @xmath5 and the description of the different possible types of sensitivity @xmath4 .    by considering as starting point the @xmath6-logistic map @xmath7,@xmath8 , @xmath9",
    ", it is found that for both infinite sets of pitchfork and tangent bifurcations @xmath10 , defined as @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the length of the initial interval and @xmath13 its length at time @xmath14 ) , has the form suggested by tsallis , @xmath15\\equiv [ 1-(q-1)\\lambda _ { q}(x_{0})\\ t]^{-\\frac{1}{q-1 } } ,   \\label{sensitivity_00}\\ ] ] that yields the customary exponential @xmath4 with lyapunov coefficient @xmath16 when @xmath17 . in eq .",

    ". in the neighborhood of one of the @xmath19 points tangent to the line with unit slope one obtains @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the expansion coefficient .",
    "the general result obtained is @xmath23 and @xmath24@xcite , @xcite . at the tangent bifurcations",
    "one has @xmath25,@xmath26 , and from @xmath27 one gets @xmath28 . for the pitchfork bifurcations one",
    "has instead @xmath29 , because @xmath30 at these transitions , and @xmath31 is now the coefficient associated to @xmath32 . in this case we have @xmath33 in @xmath23 and one obtains @xmath34 .",
    "notably , these specific results for the index @xmath1 are valid for all @xmath0 and therefore define the existence of only two universality classes for unimodal maps , one for the tangent and the other one for the pitchfork bifurcations @xcite .",
    "see figs . 2 and 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    notice that our treatment of the tangent bifurcation differs from other studies of intermittency transitions @xcite in that there is no feed back mechanism of iterates into the origin of @xmath35 or of its associated fixed - point map .",
    "here impeded or incomplete mixing in phase space ( a small interval neighborhood around @xmath36 ) arises from the special tangency shape of the map at the pitchfork and tangent transitions that produces monotonic trajectories .",
    "this has the effect of confining or expelling trajectories causing anomalous phase - space sampling , in contrast to the thorough coverage in generic states with @xmath37 . by construction",
    "the dynamics at the intermittency transitions , describe a purely nonextensive regime .",
    "an unanticipated relationship has been shown by contoyiannis _ et al _ @xcite-@xcite to exist between the intermittent dynamics of nonlinear maps at a tangent bifurcation and the equilibrium dynamics of fluctuations at an ordinary thermal critical point . with the aim of obtaining the properties of clusters or domains of the order parameter at criticality , a landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) approach",
    "was carried out such that the dominant contributions to the partition function arise from a singularity ( similar to an instanton ) located in the space outside the cluster @xcite , @xcite .",
    "then @xcite , @xcite , a nonlinear map for the average order parameter was constructed whose dynamics reproduce the averages of the cluster critical properties .",
    "this map has as a main feature the tangent bifurcation and as a result time evolution is intermittent .",
    "the starting point is the partition function of the @xmath38-dimensional system at criticality , @xmath39\\exp ( -\\gamma _ { c}[\\phi ] ) ,   \\label{partition1}\\ ] ] where @xmath40=g_{1}\\int_{\\omega } dv\\left [ \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\phi ) ^{2}+g_{2}\\left| \\phi \\right| ^{\\delta + 1}\\right ]   \\label{landau1}\\ ] ] is the critical lgw free energy of a system of @xmath38-dimensional volume @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the order parameter ( e.g. magnetization per unit volume ) and @xmath43 is the critical isotherm exponent . by considering the space - averaged magnetization @xmath44 , the statistical weight @xmath45)/z ,   \\label{invariant1}\\ ] ] where @xmath46\\sim g_{1}g_{2}\\phi ^{\\delta + 1}$ ] and @xmath47)$ ] , was shown to be the invariant density of a statistically equivalent one - dimensional map .",
    "the functional form of this map was obtained as the solution of an inverse frobenius - perron problem @xcite . for small values of @xmath48",
    "the map has the form @xmath49 where the amplitude @xmath50 depends on @xmath51 , @xmath52and @xmath43 , and the shift parameter @xmath53 .",
    "( [ tangent1 ] ) can be recognized as that describing the intermittency route to chaos in the vicinity of a tangent bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the complete form of the map displays a superexponentially decreasing region that takes back the iterate close to the origin in one step .",
    "thus the parameters of the thermal system determine the dynamics of the map .",
    "averages made of order - parameter critical configurations are equivalent to iteration time averages along the trajectories of the map close to the tangent bifurcation .",
    "the mean number of iterations in the laminar region was seen to be related to the mean magnetization within a critical cluster of radius @xmath54 .",
    "there is a corresponding power law dependence of the duration of the laminar region on the shift parameter @xmath55 of the map @xcite .",
    "for @xmath56 the ( small ) lyapunov coefficient is simply related to the critical exponent @xmath57 @xcite .    as the size of subsystems or domains of the critical system is allowed to become infinitely large the lyapunov coefficient vanishes and the duration of the laminar episodes of intermittency diverge . without the feedback to the origin feature in the map",
    "we recover the conditions described in the previous section .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the dynamics at the chaos threshold , also referred to as the feigenbaum attractor , of the @xmath6-logistic map at @xmath58 has been analyzed recently @xcite , @xcite . by taking as initial condition @xmath59 we found that the resulting orbit consists of trajectories made of intertwined power laws that asymptotically reproduce the entire period - doubling cascade that occurs for @xmath60 .",
    "this orbit captures the properties of the so - called superstable orbits at @xmath61 @xmath58 , @xmath62 @xcite . here again the lyapunov coefficient @xmath3 vanishes and in its place there appears a spectrum of @xmath1-lyapunov coefficients @xmath63 .",
    "this spectrum was originally studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and our interest has been to examine the relationship of its properties with the tsallis statistics .",
    "we found that the sensitivity to initial conditions has precisely the form of a @xmath1-exponential , of which we determine the @xmath1-index and the associated @xmath63 .",
    "the appearance of a specific value for the @xmath1 index ( and actually also that for its conjugate value @xmath64 ) turns out to be due to the occurrence of mori s @xmath1 transitions @xcite between local attractor structures at @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , we have also shown that the dynamical and entropic properties at @xmath58 are naturally linked through the nonextensive expressions for the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath4 and for the entropy @xmath65 in the rate of entropy production @xmath66 .",
    "we have corroborated analytically @xcite , the equality @xmath67 @xmath66 given by the nonextensive statistical mechanics .",
    "our results support the validity of the @xmath68-generalized pesin identity at critical points of unimodal maps .",
    "thus , the absolute values for the positions @xmath69 of the trajectory with @xmath70 at time - shifted @xmath71 have a structure consisting of subsequences with a common power - law decay of the form @xmath72 with @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the feigenbaum universal constant that measures the period - doubling amplification of iterate positions @xcite",
    ". that is , the feigenbaum attractor can be decomposed into position subsequences generated by the time subsequences @xmath75 , each obtained by proceeding through @xmath76 for a fixed value of @xmath77 .",
    "[ figura1 ] .",
    "the @xmath78 subsequence can be written as @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "these properties follow from the use of @xmath81 in the scaling relation @xcite @xmath82    the sensitivity associated to trajectories with other starting points @xmath83 within the attractor can be determined similarly with the use of the time subsequences @xmath75 .",
    "one obtains @xmath84 , @xmath77 , the positive branch of the lyapunov spectrum , when the trajectories start at the most crowded ( @xmath85 ) and finish at the most sparse ( @xmath86 ) region of the attractor . by inverting the situation",
    "we obtain @xmath87 , @xmath77 , the negative branch of @xmath63 , i.e. starting at the most sparse ( @xmath88 ) and finishing at the most crowded ( @xmath89 ) region of the attractor . notice that @xmath64 as @xmath90 .",
    "for the case @xmath91 see refs . @xcite and @xcite , for general @xmath0 see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite where also a different and more direct derivation is used .",
    "so , when considering these two dominant families of orbits all the @xmath1-lyapunov coefficients appear associated to only two specific values of the tsallis index , @xmath1 and @xmath92 .    as a function of the running variable @xmath93",
    "the @xmath94 coefficients become a function @xmath95 with two steps located at @xmath96 . in this manner contact",
    "can be established with the formalism developed by mori and coworkers and the @xmath1 phase transition obtained in ref .",
    "the step function for @xmath95 can be integrated to obtain the spectrum @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) and its legendre transform @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , the dynamic counterparts of the renyi dimensions @xmath101 and the spectrum @xmath102 that characterize the geometry of the attractor .",
    "the constant slopes in the spectrum @xmath99 represent the mori s @xmath1 transitions for this attractor and the value @xmath103 coincides with that of the slope previously detected @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the @xmath1-generalized rate of entropy production @xmath106 is defined via @xmath107 , @xmath14 large , where @xmath108 is the tsallis entropy , and where @xmath109 is the inverse of @xmath110 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "consider now the logistic map @xmath6 @xmath111 in the presence of additive noise @xmath112 where @xmath113 is gaussian - distributed with average @xmath114 , and @xmath115 measures the noise intensity .",
    "we recall briefly the known properties of this problem @xcite , @xcite . except for a set of zero measure , all the trajectories with @xmath116 and initial condition @xmath117 fall into the attractor with fractal dimension @xmath118 .",
    "these trajectories represent nonergodic states , since as @xmath119 only a cantor set of positions is accessible out of the total phase space @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath120 the noise fluctuations wipe the sharp features of the periodic attractors as these widen into bands similar to those in the chaotic attractors , nevertheless there remains a well - defined transition to chaos at @xmath121 where the lyapunov exponent @xmath3 changes sign .",
    "the period doubling of bands ends at a finite value @xmath122 as the edge of chaos transition is approached and then decreases at the other side of the transition .",
    "this effect displays scaling features and is referred to as the bifurcation gap @xcite , @xcite .",
    "when @xmath120 the trajectories visit sequentially a set of @xmath123 disjoint bands or segments leading to a cycle , but the behavior inside each band is completely chaotic .",
    "these trajectories represent ergodic states as the accessible positions have a fractal dimension equal to the dimension of phase space .",
    "thus the removal of the noise @xmath124 leads to an ergodic to nonergodic transition in the map .    in the presence of noise ( @xmath115 small ) one obtains instead of eq .",

    "when @xmath137 the fluctuations are smaller than the distances between neighboring subsequence positions of the @xmath138 orbit at @xmath139 , and the iterate positions with @xmath120 fall within small non overlapping bands each around the @xmath138 position for that @xmath140 .",
    "time evolution follows a subsequence pattern analogous to that in the noiseless case .",
    "when @xmath141 the width of the noise - generated band reached at time @xmath142 matches the distance between adjacent positions where @xmath143 , and this implies a cutoff in the progress along the position subsequences . at longer times",
    "@xmath144 the orbits no longer follow the detailed period - doubling structure of the attractor .",
    "the iterates now trail through increasingly chaotic trajectories as bands merge with time .",
    "this is the dynamical image - observed along the time evolution for the orbits of a single state @xmath121 - of the static bifurcation gap originally described in terms of the variation of the control parameter @xmath145 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the plateau structure of relaxation and the crossover time @xmath146 can be clearly observed in fig .",

    "@xcite where @xmath147 @xmath148 is shown for several values of @xmath115 .",
    "we recall the main dynamical properties displayed by supercooled liquids on approach to glass formation .",
    "one is the growth of a plateau and for that reason a two - step process of relaxation in the time evolution of two - time correlations @xcite .",
    "this consists of a primary power - law decay in time difference @xmath149 ( so - called @xmath150 relaxation ) that leads into the plateau , the duration @xmath146 of which diverges also as a power law of the difference @xmath151 as the temperature @xmath105 decreases to a glass temperature @xmath152 .",
    "after @xmath146 there is a secondary power law decay ( so - called @xmath153 relaxation ) away from the plateau @xcite .",
    "a second important ( nonequilibrium ) dynamic property of glasses is the loss of time translation invariance observed for @xmath105 below @xmath152 , a characteristic known as aging @xcite .",
    "the time fall off of relaxation functions and correlations display a scaling dependence on the ratio @xmath154 where @xmath155 is a waiting time .",
    "a third notable property is that the experimentally observed relaxation behavior of supercooled liquids is effectively described , via reasonable heat capacity assumptions @xcite , by the so - called adam - gibbs equation , @xmath156 , where @xmath146 is the relaxation time at @xmath105 , and the configurational entropy @xmath157 is related to the number of minima of the fluid s potential energy surface @xcite .",
    "we compare the dynamic properties at the edge of chaos described in the previous section with those known for the process of vitrification of a liquid as @xmath158 .    at noise level @xmath115 the orbits visit points within the set of @xmath159 bands and , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , this takes place in time in the same way that period doubling and band merging proceeds in the presence of a bifurcation gap when the control parameter is run through the interval @xmath160 .",
    "namely , the trajectories starting at @xmath81 duplicate the number of visited bands at times @xmath161 , @xmath162 , the bifurcation gap is reached at @xmath163 @xmath159 , after which the orbits fall within bands that merge by pairs at times @xmath164 , @xmath162 .",
    "the sensitivity to initial conditions grows as @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) for @xmath167 , but for @xmath168 the fluctuations dominate and @xmath4 grows exponentially as the trajectory has become chaotic ( @xmath169 ) @xcite .",
    "this behavior was interpreted @xcite to be the dynamical system analog of the @xmath153 relaxation in supercooled fluids .",
    "the plateau duration @xmath170 as @xmath124 .",
    "additionally , trajectories with initial conditions @xmath171 not belonging to the attractor exhibit an initial relaxation process towards the plateau as the orbit approaches the attractor .",
    "this is the map analog of the @xmath150 relaxation in supercooled liquids .",
    "the entropy @xmath172 associated to the distribution of iterate positions ( configurations ) within the set of @xmath159 bands was determined in ref .",
    "this entropy has the form @xmath173 , since each of the @xmath159 bands contributes with an entropy @xmath174 , where @xmath175 and where @xmath176 is the distribution for the noise random variable .",
    "given that @xmath177 @xmath178 and @xmath179 , one has @xmath180or , conversely , @xmath181 since @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 then @xmath185 and @xmath186 as @xmath187 , i.e. the relaxation time diverges as the landscape entropy vanishes .",
    "we interpret this relationship between @xmath146 and the entropy @xmath188 to be the dynamical system analog of the adam - gibbs formula for a supercooled liquid .",
    "notice that eq.([adamgibbs1 ] ) is a power law in @xmath189 while for structural glasses it is an exponential in @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "this difference is significant as it indicates how the superposition of molecular structure and dynamics upon the bare ergodicity breakdown phenomenon built in the map modifies the vitrification properties .",
    "the aging scaling property of the trajectories @xmath191 at @xmath121 was examined in ref .",
    "the case @xmath138 is readily understood because this property is actually built into the position subsequences @xmath192 , @xmath75 , @xmath193 referred to above .",
    "these subsequences can be employed for the description of trajectories that are at first held at a given attractor position for a waiting period of time @xmath155 and then released to the normal iterative procedure . for illustrative purposes we select the holding positions to be any of those for a waiting time @xmath194 , @xmath195 and",
    "notice that for the @xmath196 orbit these positions are visited at odd iteration times .",
    "the lower - bound positions for these trajectories are given by those of the subsequences at times @xmath197 .",
    "1 . writing @xmath140 as @xmath198 @xmath199 we have that @xmath200 and @xmath201 or @xmath202 this fully developed aging property is gradually modified when noise is turned on .",
    "the presence of a bifurcation gap limits its range of validity to total times @xmath199 @xmath203 and so progressively disappears as @xmath132 is increased .",
    "the implications of joining the results about intermittency described in sections 2 and 3 are apparent . in the critical clusters of infinite size @xmath204 the dynamics of fluctuations",
    "obeys the nonextensive statistics .",
