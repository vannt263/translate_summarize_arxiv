    "herein , we only consider terrestrial planet formation around a single main sequence star with a stellar companion , and aim to find similar constraints on the stellar masses and orbits that allow the formation of terrestrial planets similar to the mercury - venus - earth - mars system .",
    "a related issue is that of the long term stability of planetary systems in binaries ( after planet formation has been completed ) .",
    "wiegert & holman ( 1997 ) examined test particles around one and both stars in the @xmath9 cen ab system , and holman & wiegert ( 1999 ) explored the stability of orbits in and around ( a wide range of ) binary star systems .",
    "these two studies demonstrated that the stability regions are dependent on four parameters : the binary semimajor axis @xmath22 , the binary eccentricity @xmath20 , the inclination of the disk relative to the stellar orbit , and the stellar mass ratio @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mass of the primary star and @xmath25 is the mass of the companion .",
    "dynamical stability calculations of an earth - like planet orbiting a solar - mass ( m@xmath13 ) star with an intermediate mass companion ( @xmath25 = 0.001  0.5 @xmath6 ) have shown that the regions of stability depend most sensitively on the binary periastron @xmath26 , for a given companion mass @xmath25 ( david _ et al . _",
    "these stability calculations , in conjunction with the observed distributions of binary orbital parameters ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) , indicate that @xmath3 50% of all binary systems are wide enough so that earth - like planets can remain stable for the age of the solar system .",
    "additionally , similar calculations of bodies in circumbinary orbits ( quintana & lissauer 2006 ) , along with the observed binary period distribution ( david _ et al . _",
    "2003 ) , indicate that approximately 10% of main sequence binary stars are close enough to each other to allow the formation and long - term stability of earth - like planets . one goal of this paper is to provide an analogous constraint for planet @xmath27 around individual stars in binary systems , i.e. , find the fraction of binaries that allow for an entire system of terrestrial planets to form .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , we ( somewhat arbitrarily ) define a `` complete '' terrestrial planet system to be one that extends out to at least the present orbit of mars , @xmath3 1.5 au , which encompasses the inner terrestrial planets in the solar system and also the habitable zone of sun - like stars ( kasting _ et al . _",
    "1993 ) .    in this article , we present the results from a large survey ( @xmath3 120 numerical simulations ) on the effects of a stellar companion on the final stages of terrestrial planet formation in s - type orbits around one component of a main sequence binary star system .",
    "we examine stellar mass ratios of @xmath28 = 1/3 , 1/2 , and 2/3 ( for stars with masses of either 0.5 @xmath6 or 1 @xmath6 ) , and the stellar orbital parameters ( @xmath22 , @xmath20 ) are varied such that the systems take on periastron values of @xmath29 = 5 , 7.5 , or 10 au .",
    "multiple simulations , usually 3 to 10 , are performed for each binary star system with slight changes in the starting states in order to explore the sensitivity of the planet formation process to the initial conditions . in one case",
    ", we performed 30 integrations of a single system ( with @xmath29 = 7.5 au , @xmath22 = 10 au , and @xmath20 = 0.25 ) to produce a large distribution of final planetary systems in order to quantify this chaotic effect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the orbital stability of test particles in s - type orbits in binary star systems is discussed in  2 .",
    "the numerical model and initial conditions are presented in  3 , and results of our planetary accretion simulations are presented and discussed in  4 .",
    "we conclude in  5 with a summary of our results and their implications .",
    "prior to examining planetary accretion in binaries , we briefly consider the stability of test particles in the binary systems of interest .",
    "in approximate terms , if a binary is wide enough so that test particles in orbit about the primary remain largely unperturbed over a time span of @xmath30 myr ( characteristic of terrestrial planet formation ) , one would not expect the binary to have a large impact on planet formation .",
    "the regions of orbital stability of planets in s - type orbits have been investigated previously for a wide range of binary star systems ( holman & wiegert 1999 , david _ et al . _  2003 ) .",
    "holman & wiegert ( 1999 ) performed a dynamical analysis for stellar mass ratios in the range 0.1 @xmath31 0.9 , and for binary eccentricities 0 @xmath32 0.8 . in their study ,",
    "test particles were placed in the binary orbital plane between 0.02 @xmath22 and 0.5 @xmath22 at eight equally spaced longitudes per semimajor axis , and the system was evolved forward in time for 10@xmath33 binary periods .",
    "the outermost stable orbit to the primary star for which all eight particles survived ( which they refer to as the ` critical semimajor axis ' , @xmath34 ) was determined for each system .",
    "we have performed analogous test particle simulations for the binary star systems examined in this article , which include equal mass ( @xmath28 = 0.5 ) binary stars ( with eccentricities 0 @xmath35 0.875 ) , and binary systems with @xmath28 = 1/3 or 2/3 ( where @xmath20 = 0.25 in each case ) .",
    "test particles were placed between 0.02 @xmath22 and 0.5 @xmath22 ( with increments of 0.01 @xmath22 ) at eight equally spaced longitudes per semimajor axis .",
    "we use a ` wide - binary ' symplectic algorithm developed by chambers _",
    "et al . _  ( 2002 ) for these and subsequent accretion simulations .",
    "this algorithm is based on the mapping method of wisdom & holman ( 1991 ) , and was designed to calculate the evolution of particles / bodies around a central star with a massive companion perturbing the primary star / disk system .",
    "each system was followed for 10@xmath36 binary orbits , and the critical semimajor axis ( for which all eight particles remained in the system ) was calculated and is given in table 1 .",
    "note that some of the systems used here have values of @xmath20 in between those examined in holman & weigert ( 1999 ) , and upon extrapolation the results presented in table 1 are consistent with their study .",
    "each simulation begins with a disk of planetesimals and planetary embryos centered around what we will refer to as the primary star ( even though for most simulations the stars have equal masses , and in one set of runs the planetesimals and embryos encircle the lower mass star ) , with the midplane of the disk coplanar to the stellar orbit , and the binary companion in an orbit exterior to the terrestrial planet region .",
    "these simulations use an initial disk composed of planetesimals and embryos with masses and orbits virtually identical to those used in previous simulations of terrestrial planet formation in the sun - jupiter - saturn system , in particular , the model of chambers ( 2001 ) that was most successful in reproducing the terrestrial planets in our solar system .",
    "although this formulation is not complete , nor definitive , it provides a model that reproduces our terrestrial planet system ( albeit with somewhat larger eccentricities ) and can thus be used as a reference point . by performing a large ensemble of analogous simulations in binary systems with varying orbital elements",
    ", we can assess the effects of binarity on the planet formation process .",
    "the disk is composed of moon- to mars - sized rocky bodies which are assumed to have already formed from a disk of gas and dust .",
    "in particular , 14 planetary embryos ( each 0.0933 times the mass of the earth , m@xmath37 ) compose half of the disk mass , while the remaining mass is distributed equally among 140 planetesimals ( each with a mass of 0.00933 m@xmath37 ) , providing a total disk mass of @xmath3 2.6 m@xmath37 .",
    "the initial radial extent of the disk is between 0.36 au  2.05 au of the primary star , and the radius of each body",
    "is calculated assuming a material density of 3 g @xmath38 .",
    "the protoplanets began with initial eccentricities of @xmath39 0.01 , inclinations @xmath40 0.5@xmath17 , and specific initial orbital elements were chosen at random from specified ranges ; the same set of randomly selected values was used for all simulations .",
    "the ` wide - binary ' algorithm that we use follows the evolution of each body in the disk subject to gravitational perturbations from both stars , and to gravitational interactions and completely inelastic collisions with other bodies in the disk ( chambers _ et al . _",
    "material that is not accreted onto growing planets may be lost from the system by either orbiting too close to the central star ( for the simulations presented herein , planetesimals / embryos are removed when their periastron @xmath41 0.1 au ) , or if it is ejected from the system ( if its trajectory exceeds a distance comparable to the binary semimajor axis ) .",
    "a time - step of 7 days is used , and the evolution of each system is followed for 200  500 myr . for a discussion on the validity of using a 7-day time - step for this accretion disk , see section 2.2 of quintana & lissauer ( 2006 ) .",
    "many of our simulations began with binary stars on highly eccentric orbits , which would perturb disk material into more elliptical orbits than is considered in our chosen initial conditions .",
    "one might worry that this mismatch in initial conditions could produce a systematic bias in our results .",
    "this issue was investigated in appendix b of quintana & lissauer ( 2006 ) , in which the standard bimodal disk ( as previously described ) was centered around close binary stars . it was shown that beginning the protoplanets with the appropriate nested elliptical orbits , rather than in nearly circular orbits , did not impact the resulting planetary systems in a statistically significant manner . in other words , the systematic effect from the differing initial eccentricities of bodies in each disk on the final planet systems that form ( in otherwise identical systems ) were comparable to or smaller than the effects resulting from chaos .",
    "these results were also consistent with test particle simulations in eccentric binary star systems performed by pichardo _",
    "et al . _  ( 2005 ) .",
    "we examine binary star systems with stellar mass ratios @xmath42 = 1/3 , 1/2 , or 2/3 , where @xmath24 is the mass of the primary star and @xmath25 is the mass of the companion .",
    "table 2 displays the stellar parameters used in our accretion simulations , grouped into four sets according to the stellar masses involved .",
    "the majority of our simulations begin with equal mass stars ( @xmath28 = 1/2 ) of either @xmath24 = @xmath25 = 0.5 m@xmath13 ( set a ) or @xmath24 = @xmath25 = 1 m@xmath13 ( set b ) . in the simulations of set c , the primary star ( the one the disk is centered around ) is more massive , @xmath24 = 1 m@xmath13 and @xmath25 = 0.5 m@xmath13 ( @xmath28 = 1/3 ) . in set d , the primary star is smaller , @xmath24 = 0.5 m@xmath13 and @xmath25 = 1 m@xmath13 ( @xmath28 = 2/3 ) .",
    "the stellar semimajor axis @xmath22 and binary eccentricity @xmath20 are varied such that the binary periastron takes one of the three values @xmath29 = 5 , 7.5 , or 10 au ( see columns 2  4 of table 2 ) .",
    "note that binary systems with much wider periastra would have little effect on terrestrial planet formation , whereas systems with smaller periastra would completely destroy the initial disk of planetesimals .",
    "the binary stars are separated by @xmath22 = 10 , 13@xmath43 , 20 , or 40 au , and the eccentricities are varied in the range 0 @xmath35 0.875 .",
    "the fifth column of table 2 gives the outermost stable orbit for each system , @xmath44 ( expressed here in au ) , as described in the previous section .",
    "the largest semimajor axis for which particles can be stable in any of the systems that we explore is 2.6 au ( table 2 ) , we therefore omit giant planets analogous to those in the solar system ( which orbit beyond 5 au ) in our integrations .    for our accretion simulations ,",
    "our exploration of parameter space has two coupled goals . on one hand",
    ", we want to determine the effects of the binary orbital elements on the final terrestrial planet systems produced . on the other hand , for a given binary configuration",
    ", we want to explore the distribution of possible resulting planetary systems ( where the results must be described in terms of a distribution due to the sensitive dependence on the initial conditions ) . toward these ends",
    ", we have performed from 3  30 integrations ( last column in table 2 ) for each binary star configuration ( @xmath28 , @xmath22 , and @xmath20 ) considered herein , with small differences in the initial conditions : a single planetesimal near 0.5 , 1 , or 1.5 au is moved forward along its orbit by a small amount ( 1  9 meters ) prior to the integration .",
    "ideally , of course , one would perform larger numbers of integrations to more fully sample the distributions of results , but computer resources limit our sample size .",
    "this section presents the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "we first consider the chaotic nature of the integrations (  4.1 ) and discuss how sensitive dependence on initial conditions affects the nature of our results . in  4.2 , we present a broad overview of our simulations by showing typical sequences of evolution and general trends emerging in the results .",
    "we focus on the properties of final planetary systems in  4.3 , where such properties are described in terms of distributions .      before comparing the results of terrestrial planet growth within various binary star systems , it is worthwhile to take a closer look at the stochastic nature of these @xmath45-body simulations , and keep in mind throughout this study : _",

    "quintana & lissauer 2006 ) , if one of the planetesimals is moved only one meter forward along its initial orbit , the difference in the final number , masses , and/or orbits of terrestrial planets that form can be substantial ( see figure 1 ) . effectively equivalent starting states thus lead to different final states . as a result , the numerical simulation of accretion from any particular initial configuration can not be described in terms of a single outcome , but rather must be considered as a distribution of outcomes . to account for this complication",
    ", we performed multiple realizations with effectively equivalent starting conditions for all of the binary systems considered herein . fortunately , even though the systems are chaotic and do not have a single outcome , the distributions of outcomes are well - defined .",
    "further , these distributions show clear trends with varying properties of the binary star systems and can be used to study the effects of binaries on the planet formation process .",
    "our exploration of parameter space shows how binary orbital parameters affect terrestrial planet formation .",
    "we find that the presence of a binary companion of order 10 au away acts to limit the number of terrestrial planets formed and the spatial extent of the terrestrial planet region , as shown by figures 3  12 . to leading order ,",
    "the periastron value @xmath29 is the most important parameter in determining binary effects on planetary outcomes ( more predictive than @xmath22 or @xmath20 alone ) . in our ensemble of 108 wide binary simulations that began with equal mass stars , from 1  6 planets formed with semimajor axes @xmath21 2.2 au of the central star in binary systems with @xmath29 = 10 au , from 1  5 planets formed within 1.7 au for systems with @xmath29 = 7.5 au , and from 1  3 planets formed within 0.9 au when @xmath29 = 5 au . nonetheless ,",
    "for a given binary perisatron @xmath29 , fewer planets tend to form in binary systems with larger values of ( @xmath22 , @xmath20 ) ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "binary companions also limit the extent of the terrestrial planet region in nascent solar systems . as shown in figures 3 , 5 , and 7  9 ,",
    "wider binaries allow for spatially larger systems of terrestrial planets . once again",
    ", binary periastron is the most important variable in determining the extent of the final system of terrestrial planets ( as measured by the semimajor axis of the outermost planet ) .",
    "however , for a given periastron , the sizes of the terrestrial planet systems show a wide distribution . in these simulations ,",
    "the initial disk of planetesimals extends out to 2 au , so we do not expect terrestrial planets to form much beyond this radius . for binary periastron @xmath29 = 10 au , the semimajor axis of the outermost planet typically lies near 2 au , i.e. , the system explores the entire available parameter space for planet formation . since these results were obtained with equal mass stars ( including those with @xmath74 = 1.0 m@xmath13 ) , we conclude that the constraint @xmath75 au is sufficient for binaries to leave terrestrial planet systems unperturbed . with smaller binary periastron values , the resulting extent of the terrestrial planet region is diminished .",
    "when binary periastron decreases to 5 au , the typical system extends only out to @xmath76 0.75 au and no system has a planet with semimajor axis beyond 0.9 au ( but note that we did not perform simulations with @xmath77 5 au and small @xmath20 ) .",
    "while the number of forming planets and their range of orbits is restricted by binary companions , the masses and eccentricities of those planets are much less affected .",
    "both figures 7 and 12 suggest that planet eccentricities tend to arise from the same distribution ( with a broad peak near @xmath78 and a tail toward higher values ) for all of the systems considered in this study .",
    "the distribution of planet masses is nearly independent of binary periastron ( see figure 11 ) , although the wider binaries allow for a few slightly more massive terrestrial planets to form .",
    "finally , we note that the time scales required for terrestrial planet formation in these systems lie in the range 50  200 myr , consistent with previous findings ( e.g. , chambers 2001 , quintana _ et al . _  2002 ,",
    "quintana & lissauer 2006 ) , and largely independent of the binary properties .",
    "this result is not unexpected , as the clock for the accumulation of planetesimals is set by their orbit time and masses ( safranov 1969 ) , and not by the binary orbital period .",
    "whitmire et al . (",
    "1998 ) have analyzed the effects of perturbations by a binary companion on planetesimals during the earlier stages of planetary growth .",
    "assuming that collisions at velocities @xmath79 100 m / s disrupt planetesimals , they find that if two 1 m@xmath80 stars have periastron @xmath81 16 au , then planetary growth at 1 au is inhibited .",
    "this criterion is more limiting than the results of this paper suggest .",
    "but note that whitmire et al.s model does not include gas .",
    "perturbations by a gaseous disk can align planetesimal orbits , reducing collision velocities and thereby allowing growth to proceed and produce bodies of the sizes that we use as initial conditions over a larger range of semimajor axis ( kortenkamp & wetherill 2000 ) .",
    "our work has important implications regarding the question of what fraction of stars might harbor terrestrial planetary systems .",
    "the majority of solar - type stars live in binary systems , and binary companions can disrupt both the formation of terrestrial planets and their long term prospects for stability .",
    "approximately half of the known binary systems are wide enough ( in this context , having sufficiently large values of periastron ) so that earth - like planets can remain stable over the entire 4.6 gyr age of our solar system ( david _ et al . _  2003 ,",
    "fatuzzo _ et al . _",
    "for the system to be stable out to the distance of mars s orbit , the binary periastron @xmath29 must be greater than about 7 au , and about half of the observed binaries have @xmath82 au .",
    "our work on the formation of terrestrial planets shows similar trends . when the periastron of the binary is larger than about @xmath29 = 10 au , even for the case of equal mass stars , terrestrial planets can form over essentially the entire range of orbits allowed for single stars ( out to the edge of the initial planetessimal disk at 2 au ) . when periastron @xmath83 au , however , the distributions of planetary orbital parameters are strongly affected by the presence of the binary companion ( see figures 7  12 )",
    ". specifically , the number of terrestrial planets and the spatial extent of the terrestrial planet region both decrease with decreasing binary periastron .",
    "when the periastron value becomes as small as 5 au , planets no longer form with @xmath84 au orbits and the mass distribution tilts toward @xmath85 1 m@xmath37 , i.e. , the formation of earth - like planets is compromised . note that the results from our simulations can be scaled for different star and disk parameters with the formulae presented in appendix c of quintana & lissauer ( 2006 ) .",
    "given the enormous range of orbital parameter space sampled by known binary systems , from contact binaries to separations of nearly a parsec , the range of periastron where terrestrial planet formation is affected is quite similar to the range of periastron where the stability of earth - like planets is compromised . as a result , about 40 ",
    "50% of binaries are wide enough to allow both the formation and the long term stability of earth - like planets in s - type orbits encircling one of the stars . furthermore , approximately 10% of main sequence binaries are close enough to allow the formation and long - term stability of terrestrial planets in p - type circumbinary orbits ( david _ et al . _  2003 ,",

    "<S> we calculate herein the late stages of terrestrial planet accumulation around a solar type star that has a binary companion with semimajor axis larger than the terrestrial planet region . </S>",
    "<S> we perform more than one hundred simulations to survey binary parameter space and to account for sensitive dependence on initial conditions in these dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , sufficiently wide binaries leave the planet formation process largely unaffected . as a rough approximation , binary stars with periastron @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> au have minimal effect on terrestrial planet formation within @xmath1 au of the primary , whereas binary stars with @xmath2 5 au restrict terrestrial planet formation to within @xmath3 1 au of the primary star . given the observed distribution of binary orbital elements for solar type primaries , we estimate that about 40  50 percent of the binary population is wide enough to allow terrestrial planet formation to take place unimpeded . </S>",
    "<S> the large number of simulations allows for us to determine the distribution of results  the distribution of plausible terrestrial planet systems  for effectively equivalent starting conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we present ( rough ) distributions for the number of planets , their masses , and their orbital elements . </S>"
