    "the average rotational temperatures , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( see table  [ rot_tbl ] ) , are significantly different in each source , which suggests the presence of at least 3 temperature components .",

    "the co rotational diagrams are well fit by emission from an isothermal medium with temperatures in the range of 2000@xmath05000  k. one attractive feature of this set of solutions is that in the low density limit , the rotational temperatures are insensitive to density and depends only on the temperature ( * ? ? ?",

    "these densities are also below the critical densities of the observed co transitions and the excitation is _ sub - thermal_. even when multiple gas components with a power - law distribution of temperatures are present , a range of excitation conditions ( @xmath8 and @xmath119 ) can explain the narrow range in the observed rotational temperatures as long as the excitation is _ sub - thermal_. additionally , the co emission observed with pacs is dominated by the high temperature ( @xmath83 @xmath11 1000  k ) components , even when lower temperature components are present . for the best fit model for hops  108 ( @xmath8 = 6.0@xmath4410@xmath114  @xmath10 and @xmath119=2.4 ) , the gas components with @xmath83  @xmath11  1000  k dominates the emission even in the r1 spectral band for co transitions @xmath2  @xmath25  18 , and components with @xmath83  @xmath11  2000  k contributes more than 50% of the observed flux for lines ( @xmath2  @xmath25  27 ) observed in b2b and b3a spectral bands .",
    "in reality , a solution intermediate to those obtained with the power - law and isothermal models , with a range of temperatures in which the lower temperature ( t @xmath3 1000  k ) components do not contribute significantly to the observed emission is likely to be more robust .",
    "thus , if the fir co emission observed with pacs is dominated by hot ( t @xmath11 1000  k ) , moderate density ( @xmath8 @xmath3 10@xmath79  @xmath10 ) gas present in the vicinity of protostars , the observed rotational temperatures would allow for a relatively wide range in the temperature and density of the emitting gas .",
    "the ability to find solutions in the _ sub - thermal _ limit that do not require multiple temperature components , each of which must maintain relatively constant temperatures over a range of protostellar luminosity , makes the high temperature , _ sub - thermal _ excitation the more attractive solution for the observed fir co emission .",
    "observations of fir co lines ( @xmath2 @xmath3 25 ) from protostars prior to _ herschel _ have suggested that the co emission arises from molecular gas heated by non - dissociative shocks @xcite .",
    "studies with _ herschel _ , however , have invoked two independent mechanisms to explain the co emission observed with pacs : _ ( i ) _ uv - heating of the envelope cavity walls producing pdrs and _ ( ii ) _ small scale shocks along the cavity walls @xcite .",
    "the primary motivation for invoking the pdrs has been the narrow ( fwhm  @xmath3  2  km  s@xmath17 ) velocity component seen in the spectrally resolved line profiles of the low@xmath20 ( @xmath132 ) co lines observed towards low - mass protostars @xcite . since pacs lines are spectrally unresolved , it was assumed that this narrow component due to uv - heated cavity walls also contributes to the line flux of the higher@xmath20 ( @xmath133 ) co transitions observed with pacs .",
    "both the uv - heated and shock - heated gas components were found to be necessary to explain the observed co emission in three particular protostars modeled in detail by @xcite . in the following , we discuss how well these two mechanisms can explain the observed properties of the fir co emission from a larger sample of protostars .",
    "we argue that emission from the uv - heated pdrs along the cavity walls is unlikely to be the dominant component of the observed fir co emission .",
    "most of the observed emission , instead , is likely to originate from low density ( @xmath134 @xmath10 ) molecular gas , heated in outflow shocks , within 2000  au from the protostars .      in pdr models ,",
    "energy released from the mass accretion onto the protostar from the surrounding disk is the source of the uv flux which heats the cavity walls @xcite .",
    "the accretion luminosity of the protostars scales with @xmath5 @xcite and therefore @xmath135 is likely to increase with increasing @xmath5 . in the pdr models of @xcite , most of the uv - excited emission originates at densities between 10@xmath79 and 10@xmath136 @xmath10 and",
    "is therefore close to lte .",
    "the total co luminosity in this case is proportional to the total number of the co molecules present ( or equivalently mass of the co gas ) for a constant gas temperature .",
    "thus , in protostars with higher @xmath5 ( and therefore higher @xmath135 ) , a larger amount of gas will be heated , in turn resulting in a higher @xmath4 .",
    "the pdr models can explain the observed correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but only if the temperatures of the gas components remain the same in all the sources .",
    "indeed , the various rotational temperatures computed  @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath70 and @xmath71  for the protostars in our sample are found to be within narrow ranges .",
    "if the co excitation is _ thermal _ , as is the case in pdrs , the average rotational temperature computed for a small range in @xmath51 should be representative of the physical temperature of the gas component contributing to those co lines .",
    "it is difficult , however , to obtain similar gas temperatures in pdrs along the envelope cavity walls for protostars with @xmath5 ranging over two orders of magnitude . in pdrs ,",
    "gas - grain collisions and the subsequent thermal emission from the dust grains is the dominant cooling mechanism for molecular gas densities @xmath137 @xmath10 , and the cooling rate is @xmath28 @xmath138 .",
    "since the photo - electric heating rate is @xmath28 @xmath139 , the gas temperature roughly scales as @xmath140 .",
    "the co gas temperature can remain nearly constant in protostars with widely ranging @xmath5 values only if the envelope density scales linearly with @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ rho1_lbol_tbol ] , however , shows that the envelope density at 1  au , @xmath31 , is uncorrelated with @xmath5 , so it is unlikely that the gas temperatures along the cavity walls are similar in all the protostars .",
    "in section  [ lobe ] we showed that the luminosity of the observed co emission from an outflow lobe @xmath18 19@xmath19 ( projected distance @xmath18 8000  au ) away from the protostar is a factor of two higher than that observed for the on - source emission .",

    "the rotational temperature and luminosity of the co emission from the outflow lobe far away from the protostar ( projected distance @xmath18 8000  au ) is indistinguishable from that observed at the on - source positions ( projected distance @xmath3 2000  au ) of all the other sources in our sample , pointing to a common origin in both cases .",
    "the co excitation at the outflow lobe is likely due to heating of the low density ( @xmath134 @xmath10 ) gas in the outflow shocks and not from the protostellar accretion - generated pdrs .",
