    "the analysis of quantum channels - completely positive trace preserving maps - is one of the crucial points for quantum information theory .",
    "quantum channels correspond to processes that physically may take place and lead to evolution of a quantum state @xcite . for qubit case , we already know the analysis of quantum qubit channels @xcite .",
    "this analysis gives us a connection between the physical evolution of the system written via bloch equations and quantum channel formalism @xcite .",
    "hence one can derive mathematical conditions on parameters that appear in bloch formalism .",
    "these mathematical conditions are the consequence of the fact that each physical process is a completely positive map .    in our work , we aim at presenting similar analysis for qutrit channels .",
    "qutrit states are states belonging to three dimensional hilbert space and , in analogy to qubit case , one can use generalized bloch formalism to describe their evolution @xcite .",
    "generalized bloch equations , that describe for instance three level atoms , may present the physical context for the evolution of qutrit quantum state .",
    "in analogy to qubit case , we investigate the evolution of generalized bloch vector that evolves within a bloch ball . as a natural choice",
    ", we investigate qutrit channels of the general form of linear transformation on the qutrit bloch vector - studying affine transformations on qutrit bloch vectors .",
    "we parameterize qutrit channels and then derive conditions for channel parameters in order to obtain physical transformations : completely positive maps ( cpm ) . in qubit channel analysis a tetrahedron structure of completely positive maps appears ( for qubit unital channels ) , we show analogous analysis for qutrit channels , for which more sophisticated channel geometry emerge .",
    "this new result on qutrit channels can be linked with the analysis of bipartite qutrit states via jamiolkowski isomorphism .",
    "let us first recall the idea behind the bloch formalism .",
    "this , in qubit case , corresponds to the choice of representation of the qubit state density operator : the basis of pauli matrices @xmath0 @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a three dimensional , real bloch vector , describing the qubit state and satisfying @xmath3 ( equality for pure states ) .",
    "qubit states occupy entirely the bloch ball . in a similar way we can represent a qutrit state , a state belonging to three dimensional hilbert space . in qutrit case the choice of representation",
    "is set to be the basis of gell - mann matrices @xmath4 , the generators of @xmath5 group @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a generalized bloch vector , real and eight dimensional .",
    "qutrit states can be characterized by condition @xmath8 . however , qutrit case is more sophisticated : pure states are states for which two conditions are satisfied @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10-product is defined as @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being totally symmetric tensor @xcite .",
    "qutrit states belong to a generalized bloch ball , qutrit pure states belong to the unit sphere @xmath13",
    ". however , physical qutrit states do not occupy entirely the generalized bloch ball .",
    "the pure qutrit states ( states satisfying conditions ( [ purestates ] ) ) form a subset of the unit sphere",
    ". they can be parametrized with 4 parameters @xcite as follows @xmath14 where @xmath15 and overall phase was omitted .",
    "hence , the set of pure qutrit states is a 4 dimensional subset of 7 dimensional sphere .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that physical transformations must not only be positivity preserving but there exist more subtle conditions to satisfy , these are called complete positivity ( cp ) conditions @xcite .",
    "the classification of qubit channels according to complete positivity is well known @xcite . we want to present similar analysis for qutrit channels . + we represent physical system with hilbert space @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the algebra of all bounded operators on @xmath16 , a linear map @xmath18 is completely positive if for every positive integer _",
    "m _ the map : @xmath19 is positive ( where @xmath20 is the identity operator on the algebra @xmath21 of @xmath22 complex matrices ) @xcite .",
    "clearly , this amounts to saying that @xmath23 acts on a subsystem a of a larger hilbert space and there is a reservoir ( or subsystem b ) on which we act with unit operator @xmath20 . here , we do not know the dimension of the reservoir and therefore @xmath24 must be positive for any m. it was shown that every cpm has an operator - sum or kraus representation @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 being a set of kraus operators satisfying @xmath27 . + to evaluate whether a given transformation @xmath23 ( a linear map ) is completely positive we need to construct the so called dynamical ( or choi ) matrix of the size @xmath28 ( n is the dimension of the system of interest )",
    ". we will denote the dynamical matrix with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "dynamical matrix represents uniquely channel action .",
    "we denote with @xmath30 @xmath31 matrix with 1 at position ( j , k ) and zeros elsewhere .",
    "the map @xmath23 is cpm iff @xmath32 is positive semi - definite ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "+ channel @xmath23 must preserve hermiticity of density matrix and therefore its dynamical matrix must be hermitian : @xmath34 .",
    "trace preserving of the density operators means that the partial trace of @xmath29 with respect to the first subsystem ( a ) gives the unit operator for the second subsystem : @xmath35 . to evaluate the entries of dynamical matrix",
    ", we need to compute the action of the channel @xmath23 on @xmath30 . once again , when its action is rewritten as @xmath36 where coefficients @xmath37 characterize channel action , we see that we work with @xmath38 numbers .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath28 , positive and hermitian dynamical matrix @xmath29 must correspond to a density operator acting on an @xmath39-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this correspondence is up to the normalization factor , since @xmath40 .",
    "hence @xmath41 is a proper density matrix that we can write as @xmath42 the set of density operators defined by the dynamical matrices is only a subset of density matrices in @xmath39-dimensional hilbert space , since dynamical matrices must satisfy @xmath35 . the fact that completely positive maps @xmath43 , which are represented uniquely by they dynamical matrices , correspond to states is known as the jamiolkowski isomorphism @xcite .",
    "+ therefore , when analyzing quantum qutrit channels we can reinterpret it as an analysis of two qutrit quantum states , in qutrit case @xmath44 , therefore @xmath45 is a @xmath46 matrix .",
    "to recall the qubit case analysis , we can start with a two - level quantum system and its evolution .",
    "the latter can be written by means of bloch equations that are equations for components of bloch vector @xmath47 . if we take , for instance , the decoherence of a two - level atom , these equations read @xmath48 and represent the evolution of the system . here",
    "@xmath49 are rabi frequency and detuning respectively .",
    "@xmath50 stand for decay rates for the atomic dipole ( @xmath51 ) and decay rate of the atomic inversion ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "these equations , when put together , give rise to an affine transformation of the qubit bloch vector that is governed by the parameters listed above .",
    "any physical process amounts to a transformation of the qubit state that is already a completely positive map .",
    "however , _ not _ every affine transformation of the ( qubit ) bloch vector will be a completely positive map .",
    "the analysis of completely positive trace preserving maps on @xmath53 ( complex two dimensional matrices ) has been studied extensively @xcite and gives the answer to the problem . without loss of generality",
    "one can analyze qubit channels that transform qubit bloch vector according to @xmath54 where matrix @xmath55 consists of damping eigenvalues @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a translation .",
    "the image of the set of pure states ( @xmath58 , bloch sphere ) under such transformation is the ellipsoid @xmath59 with its center defined by @xmath60 and its axes by @xmath61 .",
    "the set of conditions on both @xmath56 and @xmath62 can be found in @xcite .",
    "when we limit ourselves just to diagonal qubit channels ( meaning @xmath63 ) , then the set of allowed @xmath56 forms a tetrahedron structure @xcite .",
    "this structure reappears also in the space of two qubit states .",
    "as before , we can start the analysis of transformations on qutrit quantum states with the analysis of a three level atom for wich we can write down bloch equations .",
    "three level atom is not the only possible physical realization @xcite but it is very illustrative .",
    "the analog of the bloch vector for the case of a three level atom was in the beginning introduced as a ( eight dimensional , real ) coherent vector @xmath64 @xcite , which components ( denoted as @xmath65 ) were defined as @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "now , as an example of the physical system we can take a three level atom for which nonzero dipole moments are between levels 1 and 2 , and 2 and 3 .",
    "the atom interacts with the electric field ( two electromagnetic waves incident on the atom ) and we assume that detunings are the same ( @xmath69 )",
    ". the corresponding bloch equations for coherent vector @xmath64 are @xmath70 where @xmath71 are related to two rabi frequencies @xcite .",
    "these equations are a generalization of the equations we have seen in the qubit case .",
    "+ in this work we use slightly different notation for the qutrit vector - we already have introduced qutrit bloch vector @xmath7 related to the choice of gell - mann matrices basis ( in some works generalized bloch vectors are also called coherent vectors @xcite ) .",
    "these two vectors ( @xmath64 and @xmath7 ) are of course equivalent .",
    "+ parameters that appear in the qutrit bloch equations have physical background , therefore the resulting affine transformation is a completely positive map .",
    "however , we can as well ask the opposite question : given an arbitrary affine transformation on qutrit bloch vector what are the conditions on its parameters which guarantee complete positivity ?      having in mind the question stated above , we will look at transformations of qutrit bloch vector that have a form @xmath72 where @xmath73 consists of 8 damping coefficients and @xmath60 is an eight dimensional translation .",
    "the image of the set of pure states under this transformation is @xmath74 together with the condition for @xmath10-product @xmath75 @xmath76 on the other hand , parameters @xmath77 must satisfy @xmath78 according to the requirement @xmath79 .",
    "however , complete positivity is a much stronger condition than condition saying that we can not exceed value 1 for the length of bloch vector .",
    "the latter , in qubit case , amounts only to statement that the density operator must be a positive definite operator . in qutrit case",
    "however , it is even less than that - since not every point within the @xmath80 sphere corresponds to density operator . + transformation ( [ diag ] ) can be rewritten to give channel coefficients @xmath37 . to construct dynamical matrix @xmath29",
    ", we apply the channel action to @xmath81 , representing it in the basis of gell - mann matrices : @xmath82 ( where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be interpreted as an analog of bloch vector ) . + we will first look at the channels that consist only of damping matrix ( diagonal channels ) and do not have a translation .",
    "these channels are in fact unital , since they leave maximally mixed state unchanged ( they are called bistochastic maps @xcite ) . later on ,",
    "we will look at channels that include also translations of bloch vector .      in qubit case",
    ", the action of the diagonal channel can be written as @xmath86 whereas for qutrits we have @xmath87 in both cases , we assume that the nature of @xmath61 parameters is quasi - damping , hence @xmath88 .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath89 at all times , therefore , the change of any initial bloch vector will lead to a vector within the ( generalized ) bloch ball .",
    "dynamical matrix @xmath29 for a qutrit channel of the form ( [ diag ] ) must be positive semi - definite in order to correspond to cpm .",
    "there are nine eigenvalues @xmath90 that must be nonnegative to satisfy positivity of @xmath29 .",
    "the first six eigenvalues give rise to conditions that can be written as @xmath91 these conditions alone lead to the set of allowed @xmath61 that has a polyhedron like structure . in qubit case",
    "we have similar set of equations for @xmath92 that define the tetrahedron structure .",
    "however , in qutrit case there are three remaining inequalities ( given by eigenvalues @xmath93 ) which reveal coupling between all the parameters .",
    "@xmath94 because of their numerical complexity they are discussed in appendix .",
    "matrix @xmath29 is hermitian , therefore eigenvalues @xmath95 must be real .",
    "for some cases , three conditions ( [ cond2 ] ) reduce to just two ( see appendix ) .",
    "all the inequalities characterize the set of allowed @xmath96 , in other words , channel parameters @xmath61 for which @xmath23 is a cpm .",
    "the boundaries of the set @xmath96 can be computed by analyzing values of @xmath61 satisfying equations instead of inequalities given by ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) . in principle , parameters @xmath61 can be time dependant , still , conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) must be satisfied for any time _",
    "t _ to have a cpm .",
    "+ if we assume , for example , that @xmath97 then time evolution of the bloch vector @xmath98 is given by : @xmath99 we can then identify @xmath100 and conditions on @xmath61 will impose conditions on @xmath101 . for this type of evolution ,",
    "one can write the lindblad equation for qutrit density operator @xmath102 , corresponding to the channel action . some more details on relation between complete positivity and master equation and lindblad operators one can find in @xcite .",
    "for qubit case , the allowed values of damping parameters @xmath103 form a characteristic structure ( tetrahedron , @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the structure that appears in qutrit case .",
    "the main obstacle here is the size of parameter space .",
    "we have eight parameters on which we impose our cpm constraints .",
    "we can investigate the @xmath96 set projecting it onto subspaces .",
    "it is easier to work with parameters paired according to @xmath104 ( this pairing refers to the form of gell - mann matrices ) .",
    "we can also put together @xmath105 ( two diagonal gell - mann matrices ) though not necessarily , since the equations are not symmetric in these two .",
    "+ on fig.[one]-fig.[four ] we show projections of @xmath96 onto the various subspaces in 8 dimensional space of parameters @xmath106 .",
    "the _ dark regions _ in these figures correspond to these combinations of @xmath61 which are _ satisfying cp conditions_. there are many such projections that can be obtained from the conditions that we have derived . in principle , the structure of the set of @xmath96 is not simply a generalization of a tetrahedron .",
    "since we have three ( or two ) conditions for @xmath61 that couple all the parameters ( in a nonlinear way ) , the simple polyhedron type structure ( emerging from inequalities that are linear in @xmath61 , ( [ cond1 ] ) ) is altered . in the figures ,",
    "one can see combination of almost rough edges with smooth behavior elsewhere .",

    "the change of qutrit bloch vector in this case will be of the form : @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "this type of channel is nonunital .",
    "below we show some examples of channels , for which we choose just two free parameters .",
    "first , let us look at the translation of the form @xmath109 it turns out that effectively , parameters @xmath110 must satisfy @xmath111 what graphically is represented on fig.[five ] - the dark region corresponding to cp - allowed parameter values has an ellipsoid form .     that satisfy cp conditions , when translation acting on qutrit bloch vector has the form @xmath112",
    "]     that satisfy cp conditions , when translation acting on qutrit bloch vector has the form @xmath113 . ]    on the other hand , if we let the translation to shift also the 8th component by the same amount as the 3rd component , therefore translation having a form @xmath114 then the allowed set of parameters @xmath115 is further limited with respect to @xmath116 - this parameter must satisfy @xmath117 . and",
    "both parameters @xmath115 must satisfy @xmath118 this is shown on fig.[six ] . the ellipsoid shape from fig.[five ]",
    "is now reshaped .",
    "we have seen what are the cp conditions for diagonal channels and investigated some examples of channels built up only with translations .",
    "what occurs when these two effects combine ?",
    "let us take the channel that changes the bloch vector according to @xmath119 in this case , to evaluate positivity of @xmath29 we evaluated the principal minors of the matrix . in principle , the matrix is positive when all the principal minors are positive , and it is negative , when the principle minors have alternating signs .",
    "however , it may happen that for some parameter values the principal minors equal to zero and the method do not detect all possible parametrization allowed by cp conditions .",
    "nevertheless , we use this method to analyze some cases and detect possible regions of positivity of dynamical matrix @xmath29 .",
    "we do not present here the list of inequalities corresponding to cp conditions because their complexity would unable any insight into the problem .",
    "we project the set of @xmath120 onto some subspaces to gain a geometrical picture .",
    "below , we can see two examples .",
    "on fig.[seven ] the dark region corresponds to the cp - allowed values of @xmath115 , for which we assume that all @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "that satisfy cp conditions .",
    "the qutrit channel contains both the diagonal ( damping ) part and the translation . ]     that satisfy cp conditions .",
    "the qutrit channel contains both the diagonal ( damping ) part and the translation . ]",
    "fig.[eight ] shows a different choice of parametrization and relation between damping parameters and translation .",
    "we let @xmath123 have independent value ( x ) from the rest of @xmath61 ( y ) , and we assume that translation is equal to the product of these two ( xy ) .",
    "as already said , the dynamical matrix @xmath29 corresponds to a density matrix via @xmath124 .",
    "the latter , in our case ( @xmath44 ) describes a class of two - qutrit states that can be parameterized by @xmath125 .",
    "the two qutrit state space is being investigated . especially , the so called magic simplex which can be considered an analog of the magic tetrahedron of bipartite qubits @xcite .",
    "the magic simplex of bipartite qutrits is only embedded in the space of all bipartite qutrits . as an example",
    ", it does not contain a state given by the density operator @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "interestingly , this state can be obtained from @xmath129 ( n=3 ) with a proper choice of parameters : @xmath130 and the rest equal to 0 .",
    "a diagonal channel with such parameter values will transform any qutrit bloch vector according to @xmath131 geometrically , the channel projects the bloch vector onto the 3 - 6 - 7 - 8 subspace and the other components of @xmath7 are lost .",
    "it resembles therefore a phase flip type channel @xcite .",
    "basing on the generalized bloch formalism for qutrit quantum states we have analyzed quantum qutrit channels that have a form of affine transformations on bloch vectors .",
    "the aim was to derive complete positivity conditions on channel parameters that may appear in equations of evolution of the bloch vector .",
    "we analyzed diagonal channels ( only with damping coefficients ) , for which we obtained cp conditions on parameters in form of inequalities .",
    "analogous inequalities appear in qubit case - for which cp - allowed channel parameters form a tetrahedron structure .",
    "the structure of the corresponding set in qutrit case is more sophisticated , and reveals not only polyhedron like characteristics .",
    "we analyzed also channels which allow only shifting the bloch vector , in which case we investigated some specific examples of translations and the corresponding cp constraints .",
    "the combined effect of damping and shifting qutrit bloch vector ( diagonal channels with translation ) was also presented by projecting the cp - allowed set of channel parameters onto specific subspaces . at the end",
    "we looked at the two qutrit states that correspond to qutrit channels we investigated , via jamiolkowski isomorphism .",
    "as an example we give a channel that corresponds to a state which does not belong to the so called magic simplex .",
    "+ one of the interesting points would be to establish the relation between the set of two qutrit states given by the dynamical matrix that we analyze and the magic simplex for qutrits .",
    "also the analysis of the structure of cp - allowed channel parameters with respect to entanglement breaking properties could reveal some intriguing results .          in the discussion of the diagonal ( damping ) qutrit channels we presented a set of conditions ( [ cond1],[cond2 ] ) that come from imposing positivity condition on @xmath29 .",
    "they correspond to eigenvalues of the matrix , and three of them have sophisticated form . in qutrit case , the dynamical matrix @xmath29 is nine dimensional .",
    "we already showed 6 eigenvalues .",
    "the remaining three correspond to finding roots of polynomial of the 3rd order . since @xmath29 is hermitian",
    ", all its eigenvalues must be real , to guarantee complete positivity of the channel , they must also be nonnegative .",
    "the polynomial @xmath132 which we analyze in order to obtain the rest of cp conditions ( eigenvalues @xmath95 ) has coefficients      the roots can be of course found explicitly , but we do not present them here . for some specific parameter values ,",
    "number of real roots can be reduced ( and therefore number of cp inequalities ) . to deduce that one has to analyze function @xmath134 and evaluate it at @xmath135 ( where @xmath136 are polynomial coefficients given above ) . for the dynamical matrix @xmath29",
    "this function is always nonpositive ( and indicates therefore real roots ) .",
    "when @xmath137 the polynomial has three real roots and at least two are equal - then the number of cp conditions reduces .",
