    "according to contemporary cosmology , the universe is made of about @xmath3 dark energy , @xmath4 dark matter , and @xmath5 baryonic ( visible ) matter @xcite .",
    "thus , the overwhelming preponderance of matter and energy in the universe is believed to be dark , _",
    "i.e. _ unobservable by telescopes .",
    "the dark energy is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "its origin is mysterious and presumably related to the cosmological constant or to some form of exotic fluid with negative pressure such as the chaplygin gas . on the other hand ,",
    "dark matter is necessary to account for the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "its nature is one of the most important puzzles in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "we consider the possibility that dark matter halos are described by the fermi - dirac distribution at finite temperature .",
    "the fermi - dirac distribution may have two origins .",
    "first , it corresponds to the statistical equilibrium state of a gas of fermions such as massive neutrinos .",
    "these particles are subjected to the pauli exclusion principle similarly to electrons in white dwarf stars and neutrons in neutron stars . as a result , quantum mechanics can stabilize dark matter halos against gravitational collapse and lead to halo cores instead of @xmath6 density cusps predicted by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model @xcite but not observed @xcite .",
    "however , there is a difficulty with this scenario because the time it takes a self - gravitating system with a large number of particles to achieve a statistical equilibrium state is usually very long and exceeds the age of the universe by many orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "therefore , the establishment of a fermi - dirac distribution in the whole cluster is not granted .",
    "furthermore , the thermodynamical temperature is expected to be very low so that the cluster would be completely degenerate and appear very different from what is observed ( except in the case of dwarf halos ) .",
    "fortunately , there is another possibility .",
    "dark matter halos may have reached a quasi stationary state ( qss ) as a result of a violent relaxation similar to the one imagined by hnon @xcite , king @xcite and lynden - bell @xcite for collisionless stellar systems such as elliptical galaxies described by the vlasov - poisson system . coincidentally",
    ", the statistical prediction of lynden - bell @xcite is also a fermi - dirac - type distribution function , although the effective exclusion principle is not due to quantum mechanics but to the liouville theorem . furthermore , the temperature appearing in lynden - bell s distribution is an effective out - of - equilibrium temperature @xmath7 that can be much larger than the thermodynamical temperature .",
    "this could account for the value of the temperature inferred from the rotation curves of the galaxies using the virial theorem .",
    "finally , this collisionless relaxation occurs in a few dynamical times and is much more efficient than the collisional relaxation . in the dilute ( non degenerate )",
    "limit , which is appropriate to large dark matter halos , the fermi - dirac distribution reduces to the boltzmann distribution .",
    "if dark matter is collisionless , a halo should not evolve anymore after having reached a virialized state . as a result , its central density can not be very high . in order to be more general ,",
    "we consider the possibility that the core of dark matter halos is collisional @xcite .",
    "this seems to be necessary to explain the presence of black holes at the center of dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "when collisional effects are taken into account , dark matter halos behave similarly to globular clusters . however , the collisions between particles do not correspond to two - body encounters as in globular clusters but rather to collisions similar to those in a gas . on the other hand , in fermionic dark matter halos ,",
    "the pauli exclusion principle must be taken into account . as a result , collisions tend to establish a fermi - dirac distribution at finite temperature",
    ". they also allow the central concentration of the system to evolve in time towards large values .",
    "self - gravitating systems have a very particular thermodynamics first investigated by antonov @xcite and lynden - bell & wood @xcite in relation to collisional stellar systems such as globular clusters made of classical point mass stars .",
    "there is no statistical equilibrium state in a strict sense because a self - gravitating system in an infinite domain has no entropy maximum ( the isothermal sphere corresponding to the boltzmann distribution has infinite mass ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems is essentially an out - of - equilibrium problem .",
    "the absence of statistical equilibrium state is related to the fact that self - gravitating systems like globular clusters have the tendency to evaporate ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , appendix a of ref .",
    "this is already the case for a non - interacting gas if it is not enclosed within a container .",
    "however , evaporation is a slow process and a globular cluster can be found , for intermediate times , in a quasi stationary state close to the michie - king distribution @xcite which is a truncated boltzmann distribution with parameters slowly changing with time .",
    "if we enclose the system within a `` box '' so as to prevent artificially its evaporation @xcite , it is found that statistical equilibrium states exist only above a critical energy @xmath8 discovered by emden @xcite .",
    "they have a density contrast @xmath9 .",
    "these configurations are metastable ( local entropy maxima ) but their lifetime is considerable since it scales as @xmath10 ( except close to the critical point ) @xcite . for globular clusters , for which @xmath11 , this lifetime is so large that metastable states can be considered as stable states . for @xmath12 ,",
    "there is no statistical equilibrium state .",
    "the system undergoes a gravothermal catastrophe @xcite and experiences core collapse .",
    "the evolution of a self - gravitating system is a three stages process .",
    "( i ) in the collisionless regime , a self - gravitating system initially out - of - equilibrium reaches a quasi stationary state ( virialized state ) as a result of a violent relaxation @xcite .",
    "( ii ) in the collisional regime , the system follows a sequence of king distributions @xcite that are long - lived metastable equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "the evolution is driven by a slow evaporation . during that stage ,",
    "the halo expands while the core shrinks and the central density increases as a consequence of the virial theorem .",
    "( iii ) when the central density reaches a critical value , the gravothermal catastrophe sets in and the system undergoes core collapse @xcite . for classical self - gravitating systems , such as globular clusters",
    ", core collapse leads to a binary star surrounded by a hot halo .",
    "hot halo '' , can be understood simply in terms of thermodynamics .",
    "this is the most probable structure in the microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) .",
    "indeed , we can increase indefinitely the entropy @xmath13 of a self - gravitating system at fixed mass and energy by approaching two stars at very close distance and redistributing the released energy in the halo in the form of kinetic energy ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "the binary has a small mass @xmath14 but a huge potential energy @xmath15 . since the total energy @xmath16 is fixed in mce , the kinetic energy ( temperature ) of the halo @xmath17 and , consequently , the entropy @xmath18 .",
    "since the halo is `` hot '' , it has the tendency to extend at large distances .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the divergence of entropy is maximum when the mass in the core is the smallest ( _ e.g. _ a binary ) . ]",
    "the formation of binaries at the center of globular clusters was anticipated early by hnon @xcite .",
    "these binaries can release sufficient energy to stop the collapse and even drive a re - expansion of the cluster in a post - collapse regime @xcite .",
    "this is followed by a series of gravothermal oscillations @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that about @xmath19 of globular clusters are described by the king model while @xmath20 have undergone core collapse .",
    "for self - gravitating systems made of fermions ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , dark matter halos ) the collapse stops when the core of the system becomes degenerate .",
    "this leads to a core - halo structure with a dense degenerate nucleus surrounded by a dilute atmosphere . in that case",
    ", we can describe phase transitions between a gaseous phase unaffected by quantum mechanics and a condensed phase stabilized by quantum mechanics .",
    "these phase transitions have been studied in detail by chavanis @xcite when the system is confined within a box .    in the present paper",
    ", we make a step further and consider the fermionic king model which is a truncated fermi - dirac distribution @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as a generalization of the classical king model to the case of fermions .",
    "the fermionic king model can be derived from a kinetic theory ( based on the fermionic landau equation ) by assuming that the particles escape the system when they reach a maximum energy @xcite .",
    "this derivation is valid both for quantum particles ( fermions ) and for collisionless self - gravitating systems undergoing lynden - bell s form of violent relaxation .",
    "the fermionic king model is interesting from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics @xcite . indeed , because of the energy truncation , this distribution has a finite mass without the need to introduce an artificial box . on the other hand , because of the exclusion constraint ( pauli or lynden - bell bound ) , there exist a strict equilibrium state ( global entropy maximum ) for all accessible values of energy @xmath0 .",
    "there may also exist metastable states ( local entropy maxima ) that can be as much , or even more , important than fully stable states .",
    "as we shall see , the nature of phase transitions in the fermionic king model is similar to that already described in @xcite for box - confined self - gravitating fermions .",
    "however , this model is more physical ( since there is no box ) and it is therefore interesting to adapt the study of @xcite to this more general situation .",
    "the fermionic king model is also interesting from the viewpoint of astrophysics and cosmology because it provides a realistic model of dark matter halos .",
    "the possibility that dark matter is made of fermions ( _ e.g. _ massive neutrinos ) has been contemplated by several authors ( see a detailed list of references in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , de vega _ et al . _ @xcite have compared fermionic models of dark matter halos with observations and obtained encouraging results .",
    "however , they use the usual fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "since this distribution has infinite mass , it is not fully realistic to describe dark matter halos .",
    "furthermore , this precludes the possibility of making a stability analysis and describing phase transitions .    in this contribution",
    ", we discuss the main properties of the classical and fermionic king models in mce .",
    "we plot the caloric curves and the profiles of density and circular velocity .",
    "we study the stability of the solutions by using the poincar theory of linear series of equilibria and we describe phase transitions between a gaseous phase and a condensed phase .",
    "we also compare our theoretical predictions to the observations of dark matter halos . a more detailed study is developed in @xcite .",
    "the fermionic king model is defined by the distribution function @xcite : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 gives the mass density of particles with position @xmath24 and velocity @xmath25 , @xmath26 gives the mass density of particles with position @xmath24 , @xmath27 is the gravitational potential determined by the poisson equation @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the maximum accessible value of the distribution function , @xmath30 is the individual energy of the particles , @xmath31 is the inverse temperature , @xmath32 is the escape energy above which the particles are lost by the system , and @xmath33 is the degeneracy parameter .    for @xmath34 , we can make the approximation @xmath35 and we recover the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath36 with @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "as recalled in the introduction , the fermi - dirac distribution may have two origins : ( i ) it describes a gas of fermions at statistical equilibrium in which case @xmath38 is the maximum accessible value of the distribution function fixed by the pauli exclusion principle ( @xmath39 is the planck constant , @xmath40 the mass of the particles , and @xmath41 the spin multiplicity of the quantum states ) ; ( ii ) it results from the violent relaxation of a collisionless system of particles ( classical or quantum ) as described by lynden - bell @xcite and worked out by chavanis and sommeria @xcite . in that case ,",
    "( [ cf1 ] ) and ( [ cf2 ] ) are valid for the coarse - grained distribution function ( usually denoted @xmath42 ) and @xmath29 is the maximum value of the fine - grained distribution function .",
    "we shall consider the two possibilities since the distributions are formally the same . in the quantum interpretation @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the temperature . in lynden - bell",
    "s interpretation @xmath45 , where @xmath7 is an effective ( out - of - equilibrium ) `` temperature '' .",
    "in order to unify the notations , we write @xmath46 where @xmath44 has the dimension of an energy .",
    "the fermionic king model was introduced heuristically by ruffini and stella @xcite as a natural extension of the classical king model to fermions in order to describe dark matter halos made of massive neutrinos .",
    "this distribution function was independently introduced by chavanis @xcite where it was derived from a kinetic equation ( the fermionic landau equation ) assuming that the particles leave the system when they reach a maximum energy @xmath32 .",
    "the kinetic derivation given in @xcite is valid either for quantum particles ( fermions ) or for collisionless self - gravitating systems experiencing lynden - bell s type of violent relaxation .    in the non degenerate limit @xmath47",

    "we could also consider the canonical ensemble ( ce ) where the temperature @xmath44 is fixed instead of the energy . in that case , the stable fermionic king distribution is obtained by minimizing the free energy @xmath59 at fixed mass . for self - gravitating systems ,",
    "the statistical ensembles are inequivalent ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , the reviews @xcite ) . in this contribution , for conciseness",
    ", we restrict ourselves to mce .",
    "this is the most relevant ensemble for dark matter halos that are relatively isolated objects ( their energy is approximately conserved ) .",
    "finally , we would like to make clear that we consider here the _",
    "thermodynamical _ stability of the fermionic king distribution .",
    "this implies that we are considering the stability of the system with respect to a collisional evolution or with respect to a violent relaxation on the coarse - grained scale ( both described by the fermionic boltzmann or landau equation ) .",
    "we shall see that the fermionic king distributions are not always thermodynamically stable , and this puts interesting constraints on these distributions .",

    ", the system forms a central black hole without affecting the halo .",
    "this could be the mechanism responsible for the presence of black holes at the center of galaxies . in order to form a black hole",
    ", the halo mass must be sufficiently large ( @xmath219 ) so that the gravothermal catastrophe can take place ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "small halos ( @xmath226 ) should not contain black holes because they do not experience the gravothermal catastrophe ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "therefore , the presence ( or absence ) of black holes at the center of galaxies may be connected to the existence of a microcanonical critical point ( @xmath202 ) in the fermionic king model @xcite .",
    "finally , we have shown that the presence of fermion balls at the center of dark matter halos is unlikely because these nucleus - halo structures are unreachable ( saddle points of entropy ) .",
    "this may explain why black holes at the center of galaxies are observationally favored over fermion balls @xcite .",
    "obviously , several configurations of dark matter halos are possible within the fermionic king model making the study of this model very rich .",
    "the system can be non degenerate ( large halos ) , partially degenerate ( intermediate size halos ) , or completely degenerate ( dwarf halos ) .",
    "we can obtain core - halo configurations with a wide diversity of nuclear concentration depending on @xmath134 ( _ i.e. _ the size of the system ) and @xmath16 . this may account for the diversity of dark matter halos observed in the universe .",
    "large dark matter halos are non degenerate classical objects .",
    "they may contain a black hole .",
    "small halos are degenerate quantum objects .",
    "they should not contain a black hole .",
    "our approach is the first attempt to determine the caloric curves of dark matter halos .",
    "this allows us to study the thermodynamical stability of the different configurations and to reject those that are unstable .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the nucleus - halo configurations considered in the past ( as in fig .",
