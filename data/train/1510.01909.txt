    "the phenomenon of large scale inhomogeneity in the universe is one of the most fundamental phenomena in modern astrophysics . despite ( or",
    "may be because ) of abundance of the high quality data our understanding of this phenomenon is now in a rather confused state .",
    "early simple self - similar ( scale invariant or scaling ) picture was challenged by appearance of the data sets with different values of the scaling exponent . moreover , advanced 3d analysis of 205,443 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - ii ,",
    "mean redshift @xmath11 ) data shows that : `` the power spectrum is not well - characterized by a single power law but unambiguously shows curvature . ''",
    "the non - scaling character of the power spectra was also confirmed by the later observations in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey , the largest component of the third sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii , @xmath12 ) containing nearly one million galaxies @xcite .",
    "that means absence of the scale invariance in the large scales .",
    "the non - scaling implies existence of at least one chosen scale in the random like system of the galaxies with a broad band spectrum . where this chosen scale come from",
    "? it is assumed at present time that the large scale inhomogeneity of the observable universe has its seeds at the last scattering surface inhomogeneities , which manifest themselves in the tiny fluctuations observed in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .    the recent high resolution",
    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation measurements @xcite provide a possibility for quantitative investigation of the nontrivial processes taking place at the _ decoupling _ of the baryon - photon plasma ( the last scatering surface ) in the early universe ( the planck space telescope scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously for more than four years between aug .",
    "2009 and oct .",
    "2013 ) .    before the decoupling the cmb photons",
    "were tightly coupled to the baryons by photon scattering forming so - called baryon - photon fluid . at a certain stage of the universe expansion",
    "the energy of the cmb photons becomes insufficient to keep hydrogen ionized and a recombination process becomes dominating .",
    "the recombination is a gradual process , but it serves as a trigger and a catalyst of the decoupling of the baryon - photon fluid .",
    "the fluid ( or plasma ) is in a motion .",
    "what type of motion it is : laminar , chaotic or turbulent ?",
    "acoustic waves , motions that came from the previous history were active at the last scattering ( see ref . @xcite and references therein for the cosmological chaotic scenarios ) .",
    "the decoupling process itself is also a source of the moving energy .",
    "a recent cmb estimation of the corresponding reynolds number @xcite shows that it is possible that the motion is transitional from a laminar to turbulent .",
    "there are many ways for such transition .",
    "one of them is through chaos @xcite . for dynamical systems",
    "broad band exponential frequency spectra are strong indications of a chaotic motion @xcite,@xcite . for fluid motion",
    "this indication can be also valid @xcite .",
    "1 ( adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows ( in the semi - log scales ) a power spectrum of temperature fluctuations observed in a simple , two - mode simulation of relaxation of a temperature filament in magnetized plasma with unstable drift waves after onset of chaos .",
    "the first peak corresponds to the fundamental mode @xmath13 and the next peaks @xmath14 correspond to harmonics of the coherent modes driving the deterministic chaos . the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 indicates the exponential decay of the spectrum @xmath15 .",
    "the dotted lines indicate positions of the peaks .",
    "one can see that period of the waviness along the exponential decay ( distance between peaks ) is equal to the rate of the exponential decay .",
    "it is clear that the both quantities : the period and the rate , are generated by the same chaotic mechanism with the chosen scale equal to @xmath16 .",
    "the data were obtained by a synthetic probe imitating the probes used in the real plasma experiments , where `` ... time signals are typically measured at a fixed spatial location by probes and are a manifestation of the effects of spatially extended structures , generated by deterministic chaos , sweeping past the probes . ''",
    "therefore the frequency spectra are manifestation of the spatial spectra and the chosen frequency scale @xmath16 is a manifestation of a chosen spatial ( wave number ) scale @xmath9 .",
    "it is significant for our consideration because we will analyse just spatial ( wave number ) spectra in the next sections .",
    "namely , we will show that the doppler cmb power spectrum @xmath0 ( obtained by the planck mission team @xcite ) as well as the 3d power spectrum @xmath1 of galaxies from the sdss - ii @xcite both exhibit the same properties .",
    "that indicates deterministic chaos as a possible common basis for the mechanisms generating the nonscaling spectra in the both cases",
    ". it also opens a way to understand more complex situations observed in the much more large sky surveys such as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( sdss - iii ) using a technique called baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) to determine the distances to the galaxies .",
    "the distributed chaos observed in the last case is characterized by a stretched exponential power spectrum @xmath10 that comes from a weighted superposition of the exponentials .",
    "so - called visibility function is used to describe optical properties of the plasma at decoupling stage . a measure of the width of the visibility function around its ( rather sharp ) maximum can be used for quantitative characterization of the decoupling stage .",
    "this stage is also called as last scattering shell ( surface ) .",
    "the last scattering probability turns out to be a narrow peak around a decoupling redshift .",
    "the visibility function is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the expansion factor and @xmath19 is the thomson cross section .",
    "the motion of the scatters imprints a temperature fluctuation , @xmath20 , on the cmb through the doppler effect @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the direction ( the unit vector ) on the sky and @xmath23 is the velocity field of the electrons evaluated along the line of sight , @xmath24 .    in the cmb literature",
    "it is used to expand the cmb temperature fluctuations in spherical harmonics @xmath25 for isotropic situation the angular power spectrum of the fluctuations , @xmath26 , is defined as @xmath27 the angular power spectrum is analogous to the power spectrum @xmath1 of density perturbations .",
    "figure 2 shows the angular spectrum @xmath0 calculated using the data obtained by the planck space telescope .",
    "the data were taken from the file com-powerspect-cmb-tt-hil-binned-r2.01.txt on the site of the planck legacy archive http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla .",
    "the straight line is drawn in the fig . 2 in order to indicate an exponential decay in the semi - log scales @xmath28 with @xmath4 .",
    "it should be noted that the waviness observed along the exponential decay has period ( distance between peaks ) equal to the same @xmath4 .",
    "it means that the waviness is generated by the same , presumably chaotic , mechanism that produced the exponential decay ( cf .",
    "introduction and fig .",
    "it was suggested in the cmb literature that on the scales @xmath29 ( an improved estimation @xmath30 the spectrum is exponentially damped , due to the photon diffusion . the exponential spectrum eq .",
    "( 5 ) , described in present note , takes place in the interval @xmath2 and the period of the waviness is equal to the rate of the exponential decay @xmath8 .",
    "also the exponential damping mentioned in the literature is not actually exponential in the form of eq . ( 5 ) , because it is caused by a diffusion process and instead of @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) they have @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a diffusion scale and",
    "@xmath34 depends on the finite thickness of the last - scattering surface ( @xmath35 for zero thickness ) .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the exponential spectrum eq .",
    "( 5 ) , described in present paper , has no relation to the photon diffusion damping .",
    "let us now look to the spatial temperature maps .",
    "3 ( adapted from the ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows a spatial cmb temperature map .",
    "4 ( adapted from the ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows a spatial temperature map corresponding to the frequency spectrum shown in fig .",
    "it is interesting to compare ( qualitatively ) the fine spatial temperature chaos observed in fig .",
    "4 with the temperature cmb map shown in fig .",
    "3 ( the orange region of elevated temperature near the center in the fig .",
    "4 , corresponding to the first mode of the temperature filament , should be excluded at the comparison ) .",
    "it is believed now that the large - scale inhomogeneities in the universe were formed from initially small perturbations in the baryon - photon plasma density field at the last scattering .",
    "the first structures in the universe were supposedly driven by the gravitational collapse of these density perturbations .",
    "the fundamental processes such as gravity , turbulence , shock waves , cooling and feedback were playing a significant role in the further structures development . at later stages , the galaxy clusters were formed .",
    "these processes are strongly nonlinear and , therefore , themselves could readily introduce chaotic dynamics .",
    "but it seems that all that were initiated by the deterministic chaos at the last scattering surface ( or may be even earlier ) .",
    "the power spectrum of a distribution of points ( galaxies for a galactic sample ) can be defined as the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean density .",
    "it seems simple but it is very difficult to calculate the real - space matter spectrum @xmath1 from a 3d galaxy survey due to survey geometry effects , effects of light - to - mass bias , redshift - space distortions and many other practical complications .",
    "therefore , the 3d spectrum presented in the ref .",
    "@xcite for a sample of 205,443 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - ii ) and covering 2417 effective square degrees ( mean redshift @xmath11 ) is rather precious one .",
    "5 shows this ( isotropic ) spectrum in the semi - log scales where the exponential decay @xmath38 corresponds to the straight line .",
    "the waviness observed along the exponential decay has period ( distance between peaks ) equal to the @xmath6 , the same @xmath9 as in the eq .",
    "it means that the waviness is generated by the same , presumably chaotic , mechanism that produced the exponential decay ( cf .",
    "introduction and figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "a more recent @xmath1 spectrum was reported in the ref . @xcite .",
    "this spectrum was calculated using the data of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( -boss , the largest component of the sdss - iii containing about one million galaxies ) . at the boss",
    "a technique called baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) was used to determine the distances to galaxies ( https://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php . )",
    "the dr11 sample of the boss covers 8500 square degrees at the redshift range @xmath12 .",
    "the sample discussed in the previous section was considerably smaller as well as the mean redshift @xmath11",
    ". therefore one can expect that the @xmath1 spectrum calculated for the dr11 sample represents a more complex dynamics than the previous one . what can be the main difference in the dynamics",
    "? first of all it could be difference in the distributions of the characteristic wavenumbers @xmath39 of the waves driving the chaos . in the previous case their distribution was rather narrow around @xmath9 .",
    "for the more complex case the distribution can be a broad one . in this case",
    "the @xmath1 spectrum can be represented as a weighted superposition of the exponentials : @xmath40    for the previous case the distribution @xmath41 can be approximated by delta function @xmath42 . to find a broad distribution @xmath41 for the more complex case one needs in some information about dynamics of the waves driving the chaos .",
    "let us assume that for values of @xmath39 for which the @xmath43 provides main contribution to the integral eq .",
    "( 8) dispersion relation of the waves exhibits scaling @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a scaling exponent .",

    "can readily construct a kinematic dimension parameter controlling the kinematic relation eq .",
    "it is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mass density .",
