    "the protonated hydrogen cyanide ion , hcnh@xmath0 , has drawn much attention because of its importance in the chemistry of interstellar clouds .",
    "hcnh@xmath0 was first detected toward sgr b2 by ziurys & turner ( 1986 ) who observed three rotational transitions of @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the fractional abundance of hcnh@xmath0 was estimated to be @xmath5 .",
    "later , ziurys , apponi , & yoder ( 1992 ) tried to observe hcnh@xmath0 in the dark clods , and succeeded to detect it toward tmc-1 with the fractional abundance being estimated to be @xmath6 .",
    "the hyperfine structure of the @xmath3 transition was resolved and the quadrupole coupling constant @xmath7 of the nitrogen nucleus was determined .",
    "interestingly , these abundances in the both clouds are generally higher than those predicted by several model calculations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main formation reactions of hcnh@xmath0 in dark clouds are the following ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; @xmath8 furthermore , hcnh@xmath0 is a precursor of hcn , hnc , and cn by dissociative recombination with electron ; @xmath9 hcn , hnc , and cn have been observed abundantly in many interstellar clouds . the higher abundance of hnc than that estimated from thermodynamical equilibrium in the interstellar cloud is a convincing evidence suggesting the contribution of these reactions ( @xcite ) .",
    "so far the branching ratio of this reaction was predicted from theoretical calculation by talbi , ellinger , & herbst ( 1996 ) and has not been measured in laboratory experiment .",
    "it can be said that the hcnh@xmath0 ion is ubiquitous in molecular clouds and plays an important role in interstellar hydrogen cynaide chemistry .",
    "the isotopic species of hcn and hnc are the precursors or the reaction products of hcnh@xmath0 as seen in reactions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and are also known to show significant deuterium enrichment in the interstellar media ( @xcite ) . the high abundance of the deuterium species can be mostly explained by chemical fractionantion at low temperature environment .",
    "however the observation of dcn or dnc in the hot region like orion - kl strongly suggests an involvement of dusts in the formation or storage process , i.e. sublimation of the fossil molecule from the dusts ( @xcite ) . the observation of the deuterium species of the hcnh@xmath0 ion , hcnd@xmath0 and dcnh@xmath0 , is essential to a thorough understanding of the cyanide chemistry in the interstellar media . in that sense ,",
    "laboratory spectroscopy of hcnh@xmath0 and its isotopic species is quite important to provide the rest frequencies of the rotational transitions .",
    "there are many laboratory spectroscopic reports for vibration - rotation transitions of hcnh@xmath0 in the infrared region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath10 , @xmath4 , and @xmath11 transitions of hcnh@xmath0 were observed by bogey et al .",
    "( 1985 ) in the millimeter and submillimeter wave region and the molecular constants were obtained .",
    "based on these results , hcnh@xmath0 was detected in interstellar clouds .",
    "on the contrary , the microwave spectroscopic study of the deuterated species has not been done .",
    "bogey , demuynck , & destombes ( 1985 ) reported a tentative detection of dcnh@xmath0 at 370 ghz region ( @xmath12 ) , however it has not been confirmed . for the vibration - rotation transitions of isotopic species in the infrared region ,",
    "the @xmath13 band of hcnd@xmath0 and the @xmath14 band of h@xmath15cnh@xmath0 were observed by amano & tanaka ( 1986 ) and they determined the @xmath16 structure .",
    "the @xmath14 band of dcnh@xmath0 was reported by amano ( 1984 ) .",
    "the experimental errors of the rotational transitions derived from their molecular constants are about several mhz or more , which are not accurate enough to search the molecule in the astronomical observation .",
    "this letter reports the laboratory microwave spectroscopy of the hcnh@xmath0 ion and its deuterated species for providing accurate rest frequencies of their rotational transitions .",
    "pure rotational transitions of the hcnh@xmath0 , hcnd@xmath0 , and dcnd@xmath0 were observed using the same experimental apparatus as that previously described ( @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , a free space discharge cell with 2 m length and 10 cm outer diameter was cooled by circulating liquid nitrogen through a copper tube soldered on a copper sheet covering the glass cell .",
    "around the cell is wound a solenoid of enameled wire .",
    "the magnetic field was generated to confine the discharge plasma .",
    "the spectrometer was a 100 khz source - modulated system .",
    "microwave radiation was generated with a combination of frequency multipliers and klystrons .",
    "the insb photoconductive detector cooled by liquid helium was used to measure the power of microwave radiation .",
    "the hcnh@xmath0 was generated by the dc - glow discharge in hcn ( 1 mtorr ) at -100 to - 140@xmath17c .",
    "the dcnd@xmath0 was with dcn ( 5 mtorr ) and the hcnd@xmath0 with the gas mixture of hcn ( 2 mtorr ) and dcn ( 5 mtorr ) .",
    "the method of a magnetically confined dc - glow discharge was employed for efficient production of protonated ions which was enhanced due to the lengthening of the ion - rich negative glow and the increase of ionizing electron density ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optimum magnetic field was about 130 gauss , and the discharge current and voltage were 40 ma and 2200 v , respectively .",
    "signal intensities of the observed lines were enhanced due to the magnetic field , confidently indicating the lines to be the transitions of protonated ions .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath12 transition of hcnd@xmath0 on the magnetic field is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .    for the hcnh@xmath0 ion ,",
    "three lines were remeasured which were already reported by bogey , demuynck , & destombes ( 1985 ) and two other lines were newly measured in the present study . on the basis of their observation toward tmc-1 , ziurys , apponi , & yoder ( 1992 ) obtained the @xmath7 constant of the nitrogen nucleus to be -0.49 mhz .",
    "for the observed @xmath10 line in the present study , the hyperfine splitting by the @xmath7 interaction of the nitrogen nucleus was not resolved .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the @xmath10 transition was about 400 khz , which is mainly due to pressure broadening and not narrow enough to resolve the hyperfine structure .",
    "the frequencies of dcnd@xmath0 were predicted from the @xmath16 structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "for hcnd@xmath0 the frequencies have been predicted from the molecular constants determined by the infrared study ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lines of the hcnd@xmath0 and dcnd@xmath0 were detected within estimated error ranges .",
    "the frequencies of dcnh@xmath0 were also predicted from the molecular constants obtained from infrared spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "several attempts were made on the detection of dcnh@xmath0 , but without success due to the small dipole moment as discussed later .",
    "all the observed line frequencies of three isotopic species are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the observed frequency may include an ion - drift doppler shift , and we measured difference between the observed frequencies of the @xmath18 transition of hcnh@xmath0 in normal and opposite electrode configurations , where in the normal one microwave radiation propagated from the anode to the cathode , and in the opposite one vise versa .",
    "however , corrections due to the drift doppler shift turned out to be unnecessary for all the measured lines because the amount of shift was smaller than our experimental accuracy of several tens kilohertz ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the observed line frequencies of hcnh@xmath0 , hcnd@xmath0 , and dcnd@xmath0 were analyzed using a rotational energy formula of linear molecule with a least - squares method .",
    "the molecular constant for each species was precisely determined .",
    "two transitions of hcnh@xmath0 were newly measured in addition to the previous study ( @xcite ) , consequently the precision of the determined rotational and centrifugal distortion constants was improved by about one order of magnitude .",
    "the standard deviation of hcnh@xmath0 lines decreased by about one order from the previous values . for hcnd@xmath0 ,",
    "the accuracy of the rotational constant was improved by more than two orders of magnitude from the previous infrared study .",
    "the dcnd@xmath0 ion was spectroscopically detected for the first time .",
    "these molecular constants are listed in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the accuracy of the rest transition frequencies is around several tens of kilohertz and they are now available for the astronomical search .",
    "in contrast to the above three species the signal of dcnh@xmath0 was not detected in this laboratory study .",
    "although we searched the region where bogey , demuynck , & destombes ( 1985 ) reported its detection and also that estimated from infrared study , the signal intensity was less than our detection limit .",
    "this is due to the small electric dipole moment of the molecule .",
    "botschwina ( 1986 ) calculated this physical quantity for four isotopic species .",
    "he reported that the dipole moment of hcnh@xmath0 , hcnd@xmath0 , and dcnd@xmath0 were -0.29 , -0.54 , and -0.26 d respectively , while for dcnh@xmath0 it was reduced to 0.004 d. our result strongly supports his calculation ; its dipole moment was estimated to be at least less than 0.1 d if the statistical partitioning of the h and d atoms was assumed in the formation reaction in the discharge cell . as a result ,",
    "the astronomical search for dcnh@xmath0 in the microwave region seems to be difficult .",
    "the dipole moment of hcnd@xmath0 is about twice larger than that of hcnh@xmath0 ( @xcite ) , so that its search in interstellar clouds may be advantageous .",
    "now we concern about a possibility of the astronomical detection of the deuterated species , hcnd@xmath0 .",
    "deuterium enrichment is observed in many molecules , as hco@xmath0 , hnc , hcn , and others .",
    "the abundance ratios to their normal species of dco@xmath0 , dnc , and dcn in tmc-1 are 0.013 - 0.017 ( @xcite ) , 0.015 ( @xcite ) , and 0.022 - 0.024 ( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "hcnh@xmath0 is related with hnc and hcn via reactions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and strong deuterium enrichment is expected for the ratio of [ hcnd@xmath0]/[hcnh@xmath0 ] .",
    "recently millar , bennett , & herbst ( 1989 ) and howe & millar ( 1993 ) predicted its ratio by model calculations in tmc-1 to be @xmath20 and @xmath21 in early time ( @xmath22 yr ) and in steady state , respectively .",
    "we employed the highest value in the present calculation , i.e. , [ hcnd@xmath0]/[hcnh@xmath0 ] = 0.1 .",
    "radiation temperature @xmath23 of the @xmath3 transition and @xmath24 for hcnh@xmath0 toward tmc-1 were reported by ziurys , apponi , & yoder ( 1992 ) : @xmath23 = 0.42 k and @xmath24 = 0.5 kms@xmath25 where the @xmath23 was summed over all three hyperfine components .",
    "column density of hcnh@xmath0 was recalculated to be @xmath26 @xmath27 using a dipole moment of 0.29 d ( @xcite ) and @xmath28 .",
    "column density of hcnd@xmath0 toward tmc-1 is therefore @xmath29 @xmath27 . for the @xmath30 and @xmath4 transitions ,",
    "the radiation temperatures in optically thin and local thermal equilibrium case are calculated to be about 230 and 150 mk , respectively , with the dipole moment of 0.54 d ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present calculation demonstrates a high possibility of the detection of the hcnd@xmath0 ion toward tmc-1 as far as the deuterium ratio is around the order of several percent .",
    "the observation of hcnd@xmath0 may help us to understand the hcn / hnc chemistry in the interstellar media .",
