    "quantum mechanics opens up the possibility of barrier penetration of both complete and partial barriers by tunneling .",
    "this purely quantum transport channel is , however , in general slow and associated with the time scale for tunneling .",
    "thus , the outermost partial barrier with turnstiles smaller than @xmath43 divides the phase space into two distinct regions where chaotic and hierarchical eigenfunctions are concentrated on either side.@xcite since the hierarchical region couples only very weakly to the leads , quasi - bound states residing in this part of phase space give rise to sharp resonances in transmission.@xcite classically , an island of regular motion in phase space consists of a set of concentric invariant curves , each of them forming a complete barrier .",

    "this difficulty can be circumvented by reducing the two - dimensional scattering devices to effectively one - dimensional systems , so called quantum graph models . here",
    "numerical constraints are less severe thus allowing to explore a regime where both isolated resonances and fcf simultaneously exist.@xcite our present two - dimensional calculations for transport through the soft - wall stadium ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) do not show fcf , even for the highest @xmath0 that was accessible by our codes , i.e. , @xmath135 or @xmath136 .",
    "we attribute the absence of fcf to the fact that even such @xmath0 are still too small to probe the turnstiles of the cantori in classical phase space .",
    "this statement is supported by our observation that the hds enter the outermost partial barrier only at resonance energies , i.e.  by tunneling .",
    "transport into the inner regions of the hierarchy in phase space seems to be suppressed by the partial barrier .",
    "this exploration of hierarchical phase space by way of turnstiles in cantori is , however , crucial for the fractal fluctuations.@xcite + our present negative result for soft - wall billiards even for moderately large @xmath0 leaves , however , the question open which mechanism is at work that has apparently produced signatures of fcf in several recent experiments.@xcite these experiments were in the regime where only a rather limited number of transmitting modes @xmath137 is open.@xcite our results clearly show that the presence of soft walls in the experiment can be ruled out as the source for fcf at moderate @xmath0 . note that this observation is in close correspondence to recent findings which suggest that `` more complicated processes than those predicted in the semiclassical models are responsible for the observed behavior of fcf''.@xcite",
    "we have investigated the classical and quantum scattering properties for a soft - wall billiard with mixed phase space representing the generic device used in experimental realizations . by analyzing the wave function probability density and the husimi distribution of scattering states we find remarkable similarities between the classical and quantum phase space structures .",
    "this enables us to classify resonant scattering states associated with regular , trapped and instable periodic classical trajectories .",
