    "recently , there has been considerable amount of attention to theoretical and experimental investigation of light propagation in parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetric optical media @xcite .",
    "the interest in study of such @xmath0-symmetric optical materials has its roots in quantum mechanics : the paraxial equation of diffraction is mathematically equivalent to that of quantum schrdinger equation .",
    "quantum mechanics requires that the spectrum of every physical observable should be real , which of course are satisfied by hermitian operators . however , bender and boettcher @xcite pointed out that some non - hermitian hamiltonians with @xmath0-symmetry can also exhibit an entirely real spectrum and may constitute unitary quantum systems without violating any of the axioms of quantum mechanics .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that for a @xmath0-symmetric complex hamiltonian , there may exist a threshold above which its eigenvalues are not real but become complex , and the system undergoes a phase transition because of spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking .",
    "in general the action of the parity @xmath1 and time @xmath2 operators is defined as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "a hamiltonian with a complex @xmath0-symmetric potential requires that the real part of the potential must be even function of position and the imaginary part should be odd @xcite . in optics such complex @xmath0-symmetric structure can be designed through a judicious designs that involve both optical gain / loss regions and the process of index guiding @xcite . in such settings , complex refractive index distribution @xmath7 plays the role of an optical potential so that the index guiding @xmath8 and the gain / loss profile @xmath9 satisfy @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "unusual exotic phenomena like @xmath0 phase transition , band merging , double refraction , non - reciprocity @xcite , and unidirectional invisibility @xcite etc have been reported to exist in linear @xmath0-symmetric complex optical media .",
    "spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking has been experimentally observed in active or passive @xmath0 dimers @xcite and periodic lattices @xcite .",
    "these findings , in turn , have stimulated considerable research activity in the non - linear @xmath0-symmetric systems as well .     in the nonlinear domain ,",
    "a novel class of one and two dimensional localized modes were found to exist below and above the phase transition point @xcite and the interplay between the kerr nonlinearity and the @xmath0 threshold was investigated @xcite .",
    "subsequently , nonlinear modes are studied in complex @xmath0-symmetric periodic @xcite , gaussian @xcite , bessel @xcite , scarf - ii @xcite , and harmonic @xcite potentials , as well as in a harmonic trap with a rapidly decaying @xmath0-symmetric imaginary component @xcite .",
    "stable localized modes in a @xmath0-symmetric slab waveguide with distributed gain and loss are found in @xcite .",
    "existence of optical solitons in @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear couplers with gain / loss @xcite , gap solitons in @xmath0-symmetric optical lattices @xcite and optical defect modes in @xmath0-symmetric potentials @xcite are also reported .",
    "stable 1d and 2d bright spatial solitons are found to exist in defocusing kerr media with @xmath0-symmetric scarf ii potentials @xcite .",
    "also , it has been found that the gray solitons in @xmath0-symmetric potentials can be stable @xcite .",
    "however the existence of nonlinear localized modes in yet another important potential e.g. complex @xmath0-symmetric rosen - morse well has not been reported so far . the complex rosen - morse potential well is characterized by the same real component as the complex scarf - ii potential , however , its imaginary component is different .",
    "in fact , in contrast with the real component , the imaginary potential component does nt vanish asymptotically , rather it tends to a finite value .",
    "this is the reason why the phenomenon of spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0-symmetry is elusive in such system @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the bound state energy eigenvalues of @xmath0-symmetric rosen - morse potential well undergoes a shift from negative to positive domain for certain range of parameters which controls the strength of the potential .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the propagation of nonlinear beam in a single @xmath0 waveguide cell which is characterized by the nonlinear schrdinger equation with complex rosen - morse potential well .",
    "specifically , the existence of the spatial localized modes have been reported in both one - dimensional and two - dimensional settings with self - focusing and self - defocusing kerr nonlinearity .",
    "we have shown , with the help of linear stability analysis of the one - dimensional localized modes , that though the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0-symmetry does not occur in complex rosen - morse well the localized modes corresponding to nonlinear schrdinger equation are always unstable .",
    "this linear instability has been verified by direct numerical simulation of the governing equation .",
    "the transverse power flow density associated with these nonlinear localized modes has also been examined .",
    "we consider optical wave propagation in a kerr nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric potential . in this case ,",
    "@xmath12-dimensional optical beam propagation along longitudinal @xmath13 direction is governed by the following non - linear schrdinger like equation @xcite @xmath14 \\psi + \\sigma |\\psi|^2 \\psi = 0 . \\label{e1}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 is slowly varying complex electric field envelop , @xmath16 is the transverse co - ordinate , and @xmath17 represent the self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearity respectively . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the real and imaginary parts of the complex @xmath0-symmetric potential such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "physically , @xmath18 is responsible for the bending and slowing down of light , and @xmath19 can lead to either amplification ( gain ) or absorption ( loss ) of light within an optical material .",
    "the optical beam propagation in a single @xmath0 cell is important to understand light self - trapping in complex optical lattices . in order to investigate the optical beam propagation in a single @xmath0 cell , we consider the complex @xmath0-symmetric rosen - morse potential well as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 characterizes the strength of the real and imaginary parts of the potential , respectively . both the real and imaginary part of this potential are shown in figure [ f1]a for the potential parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the linear schrdinger eigenvalue problem for the potential @xmath27 has been thoroughly studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that all the bound state energy eigenvalues corresponding to the linear schrdinger equation of complex rosen - morse well are real so that the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0-symmetry never occur . however , the energy eigenvalues @xmath28 begin to shift from negative to the positive domain when the strength of the non - hermiticity is increased .",
    "in fact all the energy eigenvalues become positive whenever @xmath29 . here , we search for stationary solution of the nonlinear equation ( [ e1 ] ) in the form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the real propagation constant , and the complex function @xmath32 satisfies following equation @xmath33 \\phi + \\sigma |\\phi|^2 \\phi = \\lambda \\phi . \\label{e3}\\ ] ] in the following we report the existence and linear stability of the localized modes of the above nonlinear equation ( [ e3 ] ) for both the self - focusing and self - defocusing cases .        for @xmath34 , equation ( [ e3 ] )",
    "is found to admit an exact analytical expression of the localized mode of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 in figure [ f1]b , the real and imaginary parts of this spatial soliton have been shown for @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 . to focus on the properties of this non - linear solution",
    ", we examine following three quantities : the transverse power flow density ( poynting vector ) @xmath40 across the beam , the power @xmath41 , and the linear stability of these localized modes . for the nonlinear modes given in equation ( [ e4 ] ) ,",
    "the poynting vector @xmath42 depends on the sign of the strength , @xmath24 , of the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "it may be both negative and positive for negative and positive values of @xmath24 respectively .",
    "however , we consider only positive values of @xmath24 in which case @xmath40 is everywhere positive and the power flow in the @xmath0 cell is in one direction , i.e. from the gain towards loss domain . for @xmath25 , @xmath26 ,",
    "the transverse power flow is shown in figure [ f1](c ) .",
    "for the localized modes ( [ e4 ] ) the power @xmath41 is calculated as @xmath43 clearly , the power is independent of the parameter @xmath24 . in figure [ f1](d )",
    "we have shown the power @xmath41 as a function of the real potential strength parameter @xmath23 .",
    "it remains positive for all values of the parameter @xmath23 .",

    "<S> we report the existence and properties of localized modes described by nonlinear schrdinger equation with complex @xmath0-symmetric rosen - morse potential well . </S>",
    "<S> exact analytical expressions of the localized modes are found in both one dimensional and two - dimensional geometry with self - focusing and self - defocusing kerr nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> linear stability analysis reveals that these localized modes are unstable for all real values of the potential parameters although corresponding linear schrdinger eigenvalue problem possesses unbroken @xmath0-symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this result has been verified by the direct numerical simulation of the governing equation . the transverse power flow density associated with these localized modes has also been examined . </S>"
