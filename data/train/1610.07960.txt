    "an example of a well studied biochemical oscillation is the phosphorylation - dephosphorylation cycle of the kaic protein @xcite .",
    "this phosphorylation - dephosphorylation cycle functions as a circadian clock allowing a cyanobacterium to tell time @xcite , i.e. , to oscillate in synchrony with day - night changes .",
    "another example of a biochemical oscillation that is related to a phosphorylation - dephosphorylation cycle of a protein happens in the activator - inhibitor model recently analyzed in @xcite .",
    "more generally , biochemical oscillations are typically associated with a protein that goes through a cyclic sequence of states .",

    "brownian clocks are stochastic and , therefore , some uncertainty must be associated with them . quite generally ,",
    "uncertainty related to stochastic changes at the molecular level is an important issue in biophysics .",
    "for example , the berg and purcell limit on the maximal precision of a receptor that measures an external ligand concentration is such a fundamental result @xcite .",
    "the relation between precision of some kind and energy dissipation in biophysics has become an active area of research @xcite , often using concepts from stochastic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "specific examples include a relation between energy dissipation and adaptation error in chemotaxis @xcite , bounds on the precision of estimating an external ligand concentration by a receptor related to energy consumption @xcite , a relation between energy dissipation and accuracy in biochemical oscillations @xcite , and the relation between information - theoretical quantities and entropy production in biophysically inspired models @xcite .",
    "this last example is also related to the growing field of information and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the question we investigate in this paper concerns the relation between precision and dissipation in brownian clocks .",
    "given that the clock should have a certain precision , what is the minimal energy budget required to run a clock with this precision ?",
    "we model a brownian clock as an inhomogeneous biased random walk on a ring .",
    "the different states of the clock can be interpreted as different states of a protein that influences a biochemical oscillation ; changes in these states would correspond to , e.g. , conformational changes or phosphorylation steps .",

    "hence , a clock in this second class is fundamentally different from a clock driven by a fixed thermodynamic force .",
    "the mathematical treatment of systems that reach a periodic steady state , which are driven by deterministic protocols , is typically difficult . in particular , calculating the dispersion associated with the clock can be quite challenging @xcite . for our investigation on the fundamental differences between the two classes we consider a generic theoretical framework for which the protocol changes at random time intervals @xcite .",
    "such protocols have been realized in experiments @xcite . within this theoretical framework",
    "the system , i.e. , the clock , and the external protocol together form a bipartite markov process @xcite .",

    "we confirm numerically that the corresponding clock with a deterministic protocol can also achieve high precision with vanishing dissipation .    for protocols that change at stochastic times ,",

    "<S> , we show that a clock driven by a periodic variation of an external protocol can achieve arbitrary precision at arbitrarily low cost . </S>",
    "<S> this result constitutes a fundamental difference between processes driven by a fixed thermodynamic force and those driven periodically . as a main technical tool , we map a periodically driven system with a deterministic protocol to one subject to an external protocol that changes in stochastic time intervals , which simplifies calculations significantly . in the non - equilibrium steady state of the resulting bipartite markov process </S>",
