    "it has been over a decade since the discovery of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) @xcite and the interest level in these systems continues to be high .",
    "the majority of theoretical work on cnts focuses on understanding the effects of the electron - electron interactions using the celebrated luttinger liquid theory.@xcite experimental observation of superconductivity in ropes of nanotubes @xcite and small - radius nanotubes in a zeolite matrix @xcite has also motivated theoretical studies of the electron - phonon interactions ( epi ) , including the analysis of charge density wave ( cdw ) @xcite and superconducting ( sc ) @xcite instabilities . in this work",
    "we study the electron - phonon interactions in cnts and discuss possible instabilities to the cdw and sc orders .",
    "our approach provides reliable parameters for the effective hamiltonians we use in contrast to the luttinger liquid treatments where obtaining such accurate quantities is quite difficult .",
    "a conventional starting point for discussing the electron - phonon interaction in solids is the frlich hamiltonian @xcite @xmath1 here @xmath2 creates an electron with quasimomentum @xmath3 in band @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 , @xmath6 creates a phonon with lattice momentum @xmath7 and polarization @xmath8 , and @xmath9 modulo a reciprocal lattice vector .",

    "( [ frolich ] ) for the cnts is the zone - folding method ( zfm ) .",
    "@xcite the essence of this method is to take the electron band structure and the phonon dispersion for graphene and quantize momenta in the direction of the wrapping .",
    "the main results of such a procedure may be summarized as follows .",
    "the only bands crossing the fermi level in graphene are the bonding and the antibonding combinations of the atomic @xmath22 orbitals .",
    "hence , the zone - folding method predicts that these are the only bands which may cross the fermi level in carbon nanotubes .",
    "the condition for the quantized momenta to cross the dirac points of the graphene gives the condition for the ( n , m ) cnt to be metallic : @xmath23 should be divisible by 3 .",
    "the zfm also predicts that the electron - phonon coupling in the cnts should be dominated by the in - plane optical modes .",
    "this follows from the fact that the latter have the largest effect on the overlaps between the @xmath22 orbitals of the neighboring carbon atoms .        while the zfm was shown to provide a quantitatively accurate description of the larger radius nanotubes , it is expected to fail as the radius of the nanotubes",
    "is decreased and the curvature of the c - c bonds becomes important . determining the band structure , the phonon dispersion , and",
    "the electron - phonon coupling of the small radius cnts requires detailed microscopic calculations . in this paper",
    "we use the empirical tight - binding model @xcite to provide such analysis for three types of small - radius nanotubes : ( 5,0 ) with the diameter 3.9  , ( 6,0 ) with the diameter 4.7  , and ( 5,5 ) with the diameter 6.8  .",
    "we find that the large curvature of the c - c bonds leads to qualitative changes in the band structure of the ( 5,0 ) and ( 6,0 ) nanotubes ( band structures of the ( 6,0 ) and ( 7,0 ) nanotubes have been discussed previously in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the ( 5,0 ) cnt becomes metallic from strong hybridization between the @xmath5 and @xmath24 bands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5,0comb ] ) .",
    "frequencies of the phonon modes in small radius cnts are also strongly renormalized from their values in graphene .",
    "not only does the out - of - plane acoustic mode become a finite frequency breathing mode , @xcite but even the optical modes change their energy appreciably ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : pho5,0 ] ) .",
    "finally , the electron - phonon coupling changes qualitatively in the small - radius cnts .",
    "it is no longer dominated by the in - plane optical modes but by the out - of - plane optical modes which oscillate between the @xmath25 bonding of graphene and the @xmath26 bonding of diamond ( see discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we find that the strong effects of the cnt curvature decrease rapidly with increasing the tube radius .",
    "already for the ( 5,5 ) nanotubes the zfm gives a fairly accurate description of the band structure as well as the electron - phonon interactions .",
    "determining parameters of the frlich hamiltonian for a one - dimensional system is not as straightfoward as for two and three - dimensional metals .",
    "traditional methods for analyzing epi from first - principles calculations are mean - field and , therefore , suffer from instabilities intrinsic to one - dimensional systems . in particular , the frozen - phonon approximation , which is commonly used to determine the phonon frequencies , @xmath11 , in eq .",
    "( [ frolich ] ) gives imaginary frequencies close to the nesting wave vector @xmath27 .",
    "this is the result of the giant kohn anomaly , @xcite which corresponds to the peierls instability of the one - dimensional electron - phonon system.@xcite an important result of our paper is that we developed a new formalism , which combines the frozen - phonon approximation with the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) analysis of the epi .",
    "this allows us to extract effective non - singular parameters of the frlich hamiltonian from first - principles calculations or from the empirical tight - binding model .",
    "this technique should be applicable to many systems other than carbon nanotubes .",

    "( [ frolich ] ) for the ( 5,0 ) , ( 6,0 ) , and ( 5,5 ) cnts we discuss possible superconducting and charge - density wave instabilities in these systems .",
    "we find that neglecting the residual coulomb interaction leads to much stronger cdw instabilities in all three cases ( in such analysis coulomb interaction is included only at the mean - field level via the energy of the single - particle quasi - stationary states , @xmath28 ) . in the mean - field approximation",
    "we find the onset of the peierls instability at temperatures 160 , 5 , and @xmath29 k for ( 5,0 ) , ( 6,0 ) , and ( 5,5 ) cnts respectively .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "now we discuss our methods for calculating input parameters to the frlich hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ frolich ] ) for the representative nanotubes .",
    "our analysis relies on the the empirical tight - binding model @xcite but it is easily amenable to any density - functional theory @xcite treatment of the system .      to compute the electronic structure of the cnts we study , we use the nrl tight - binding method @xcite which has been tested and provided accurate results on a variety of materials . in this method ,",
    "the slater - koster tight - binding matrix elements are parametrized and are fit to reproduce the first - principles density - functional band structures and total energies , with around 70 adjustable parameters per element .",
    "we study the ( 5,0 ) , ( 6,0 ) , and ( 5,5 ) cnts which are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:5,0comb],[fig:6,0comb ] , and [ fig:5,5comb ] .",
    "the smallest possible unit cells for these cnts contain 20 , 24 , and 20 atoms respectively .",
    "these cnts are relaxed by minimizing their total energy per unit cell with respect to the atomic coordinates using 35 k - points in the first brillouin zone . matrix elements between neighboring atoms of up to 5.5    were used .",
    "the calculations were performed on an orthorhombic lattice with spacing between parallel cnts of 16   , a distance sufficiently large to ensure negligible dispersion from inter - tube hopping .",
    "once the cnts are relaxed , the band structure is calculated .      to calculate the electron - phonon coupling vertices and the phonon frequencies which will be discussed in the subsequent sections",
    ", one needs to have the ionic displacements corresponding to the normal vibrational modes of the cnt . as pointed out previously , @xcite we find that it is typically sufficient to use the zone - folded modes of a graphene sheet , even for the small - radius cnts we study as will be discussed below .",
    "following the method used in the book of saito _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite we have computed the @xmath32 dynamical matrix of a ( 5,0 ) cnt and in fig .  [ fig : modes_fold ] we compare the resulting phonon dispersions with the zone - folding results .",
    "the ionic displacement modes obtained by the two different methods are very similar except for a few special cases .",
    "for instance , the zone - folding results give three acoustic modes which correspond to translating the graphene sheet in different directions . upon rolling the graphene sheet ,",
    "these modes get mapped to two acoustic modes corresponding to rotation about the cnt axis and translation along the cnt axis and the optical breathing mode .",
    "conversely , diagonalizing the dynamical matrix of the cnt gives four acoustic modes corresponding to translations in three directions and the rotating mode ( actually using the method of ref .",
    ", one obtains a small spurious frequency for the rotating mode as pointed in this reference ) . upon unrolling the cnt to the graphene sheet , the rotating mode and",
    "the mode corresponding to translation along the cnt axis will become acoustic modes of the graphene sheet .",
    "however , the two cnt translational modes which are perpendicular to the cnt axis will get mapped to ionic displacements which are not eigenmodes of the graphene sheet which are mixtures of in - plane and out - of - plane oscillations .",
    "in addition , using the dynamical matrix of the cnt , we find that there is mixing between the breathing and strething modes around @xmath33 . in this vicinity",
    ", there is level repulsion from the lifting of the degeneracy of these modes . away from this point ,",
    "the modes are , to a good approximation , decoupled .",
    "in our analysis of the electron - phonon coupling we use the displacements obtained from the zone - folding method to simplify the calculations , as well as to give a clear conceptual picture .",
    "we then check that none of the important electron - phonon couplings come from any of the few graphene modes for which the zone - folding method breaks down .          the electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mkk ] ) can be evaluated by using the finite difference formula @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the perturbed and the unperturbed lattice potentials respectively .",
    "a method for calculating the expression ( [ mkk ] ) with a plane - wave basis set was previously developed.@xcite in this paper we extend this procedure to tight - binding models .",
    "we introduce the standard tight - binding notation @xmath37    @xmath38    here @xmath39 are the electron states for isolated carbon atoms , @xmath40 runs over unit cells , @xmath16 runs over basis vectors in the unit cell , and @xmath41 runs over orbital type .",
    "we find ( for details , see appendix [ appendix : mkk ] ) @xmath42 this expression can be computed by evaluating the tight - binding hamiltonian and overlap matrices for the distorted lattice , evaluating the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the wave functions for the undistorted lattice , and performing the above sum .    in all the calculations presented in this paper we used the zfm to find phonon eigenvectors in the nanotubes starting from the phonon eigenvectors in graphene.@xcite the latter",
    "have been obtained using the @xmath45 dynamical matrix of graphene given in ref .  .",
    "we emphasize that we use the zfm only to find the phonon eigenvectors in small nanotubes , but not the phonon frequencies .",
    "the frequencies are affected strongly by the cnt curvature , and should be computed directly .",

    "when we apply this procedure to one - dimensional cnts , we find that @xmath52 becomes negative around certain wave vectors ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : pho5,0 ] ) .",
    "a closer inspection shows that such anomalous softening always corresponds to one of the @xmath53 wave vectors of the electron bands indicating the presence of the giant kohn anomaly .",

[ sec : sc ] and appendix [ appendix : migdal - eliashberg ] ) to obtain the charge - density wave and superconducting transition temperatures , the result with the higher transition temperature being the dominant phase at low temperatures .",
    "for instance , when the cdw is dominant , the fermi surface will be destroyed around @xmath0 eliminating superconductivity altogether . by this method , we provided an exhaustive analysis of three types of cnts : ( 5,0 ) , ( 6,0 ) , and ( 5,5 ) . the more conventional larger - radius ( 5,5 )",

    "for the ultrasmall radius ( 5,0 ) and ( 6,0 ) cnts , however , the cdw was found to be the dominant phase , with transition temperatures of @xmath134 and @xmath135 k respectively .",
    "for both of these cnts , @xmath107 is incommensurate with the underlying lattice .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to larger radius cnts which have dominant electron - phonon coupling to the in - plane phonon modes , the ultrasmall ( 5,0 ) and ( 6,0 ) cnts were found to have dominant coupling to the out - of - plane phonon modes ( see fig .",

    "this is further supported by the frozen - phonon computation of frequencies which show the most robust kohn anomalies for these modes ( see fig .",

    "when we include the coulomb interaction , for the ( 5,0 ) cnt we find that the cdw order is suppressed much more strongly than superconductivity . more specifically , our analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : coulomb ] shows that the cdw transition is pushed down to unobservably low temperatures , whereas the superconducting @xmath30 is reduced to 1 k. hence our calculation supports the possibility of observing superconductivity in ultrasmall cnts .",
    "it is quite foreseeable that a more detailed model for the coulomb interaction could raise @xmath30 to the value seen experimentally , especially considering the exponential dependence of the superconducting transition temperature on the coulomb interaction strength .",

    "there is a slight technical problem with the above method because @xmath3 and @xmath153 are not the same in the tight - binding matrix .",
    "however , it can be shown that the correct result will be obtained by using @xmath154 and @xmath155 for the tight - binding and overlap matrices ( or the similar expression with @xmath156 ) in the limit of a large supercell .",
    "that is , when the distance over which neighboring atoms interact is small compared to the length of a unit cell , this method becomes exact .",
    "when we apply this method , we checked for convergence of the coupling as a function of the unit cell size .",
    "obtaining quantitative parameters of superconductors described by the bcs theory like the transition temperature and the wave vector - dependent superconducting gap from microscopic models has developed into a powerful tool for understanding experimentally realized systems as well as even predicting new superconductors.@xcite though excellent review articles exist , @xcite we will establish the key results of the theory below in attempt to be as self - contained as possible .",
    "we will also show how to incorporate the electron - phonon coupling into the phonon parameters which become important in 1d due to the cdw instability .        in the following to simplify notation , we will consider a single band system only .",
    "the central ingredient which , in principle , allows one to calculate the superconducting transition temperature to high accuracy is migdal s theorem @xcite which allows one to evaluate the electron self - energy with small error as @xmath157 this expression for the self - energy is shown in fig .",

    "we then replace @xmath185 and @xmath186 with their fermi - surface averages @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "this approximation is valid when the fermi - surface is fairly isotropic .",
    "now by equating the coefficients of the matrices @xmath189 and @xmath190 we finally arrive at the equations @xmath191 @xmath192 where @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath197 was inserted to account for the bare electron - electron interaction that is not included in our original hamiltonian eq .",

    "we also note that a generalization to the case where the fermi surface is anisotropic is straightforward.@xcite    now , for typical three - dimensional solids the phonon frequencies are affected very little by the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "therefore , the above formalism where we have used the non - interacting phonon green s function @xmath199 works remarkably well in 3d .",
    "this is not the case , however , in 1d where one is encountered with the cdw instability .",
    "a more accurate phonon green s function is given by @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the undressed frequency ( without electron - phonon coupling ) and @xmath54 is the dressed frequency ( which , as seen above can have strong temperature dependence ) . calculating the dressed phonon green s function can be challenging because one needs both @xmath202 and @xmath54 .",
    "however , we notice that when we substitute eq .",
    "( [ dressed ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) we have the fortuitous cancellation of @xmath202 in the numerator of @xmath203 with that in the denominator of @xmath204 .",

    "( [ eli1a ] ) , ( [ eli2a ] ) , and ( [ lambda ] ) , one can thereby construct the `` dressed '' eliashberg equations which takes into account the influence of the electron - phonon coupling on the phonon frequencies which is important in 1d .",
    "note also that since some modes will have temperature dependence , the eliashberg equations must be solved self consistently .",
    "that is , we must find a temperature such that the sc transition temperature determined from the eliashberg equations is the same as the temperature used for the input dressed phonon frequencies .",
    "this can be done by iteration .",
    "furthermore , this method allows us to tell which will be the dominant phase at low temperature of our system .",
    "if we find a self - consistent solution of the eliashberg equations and @xmath206 , then superconductivity will be the dominant correlation .",

    "in this appendix , we discuss in detail the role of acoustic phonons for small - radius nanotubes .",
    "earlier theoretical analysis of the electron - phonon interactions in 1d systems suggested that acoustic phonons can play a dominant role in stabilizing the superconducting state.@xcite we will show , however , that since the dominant coupling comes from optical modes , that this effect is not important for the cnts we study .",

    "thus one sees that @xmath210 scattering from acoustic phonons can be very important in one - dimensional electron - phonon systems .",
    "from such a process the so - called wentzel - bardeen instability @xcite can occur which has recently been studied in the context of cnts.@xcite we also note that a similar analysis can be carried out for the optical phonons , and it is found that the @xmath210 processes are much smaller than the @xmath226 process .    with the above method",

    "in practice , we find that using this procedure actually changes @xmath106 by only a small amount . for instance , for the ( 5,0 )",
    "cnt , @xmath106 only increases by less than 1% .",
    "this is because the dominant contributions to @xmath106 are from coupling to the optical modes as discussed in sec .",
