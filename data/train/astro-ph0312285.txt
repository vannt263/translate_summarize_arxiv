    "the boundary between classical planets ( e.g. , jupiter ) and stars has been blurred by the discovery of brown dwarfs , objects which presumably form like stars but lack sufficient mass to sustain core hydrogen fusion @xcite .",
    "known brown dwarfs exhibit a number of features similar to those of giant planets , including size = 7.15@xmath810@xmath9 cm and m@xmath1 = 1.90@xmath810@xmath10 g = 0.00095 m@xmath11 throughout this article @xcite . ]",
    "( r @xmath5 r@xmath1 ) , atmospheric composition ( e.g. , ch@xmath12 , condensate clouds ) , and possibly mass ( of order 10 m@xmath1 ) ; but are typically found in stellar environments  as isolated field and cluster objects and as wide companions to main sequence stars .",
    "while brown dwarfs appear to be rare as close companions to stars @xcite , a regime occupied by solar and extrasolar planets , the possibility of planetary ejection @xcite or brown dwarf capture @xcite , and the identification of low mass ratio binaries with substellar secondaries ( e.g. , hr 7329ab ; lowrance et al .",
    "2000 ) , makes it impossible to unambiguously deduce the origin of a particular substellar object .",
    "this situation has led to considerable debate over the definition of a planet and its distinction from a low - mass brown dwarf @xcite .    recently , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter z02 ) have identified a brown dwarf in the direction of @xmath2 orionis particularly relevant to this debate .",
    "the object , s ori 053810.1 - 023626 ( hereafter s ori 70 ) , is classified as a t dwarf based on the presence of ch@xmath12 absorption in its near - infrared spectrum @xcite , and therefore has an effective temperature ( t@xmath13 ) less than @xmath512001400 k @xcite . z02",
    "identify this object as a candidate member of the young ( age @xmath5 1 - 8 myr ) @xmath2 orionis cluster , and deduce an estimated mass of only 3@xmath0 m@xmath1 , potentially the least massive brown dwarf known . both z02 and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mz03 ) claim that cluster membership for s ori 70 is verified by ( 1 ) comparative near - infrared spectroscopy with the presumably older ( higher surface gravity ) field t dwarf 2mass j05591914@xmath31404488 @xcite ; ( 2 ) spectral fits to theoretical models from @xcite that yield a low surface gravity consistent with a young , low mass brown dwarf ; and ( 3 ) low foreground contamination by field t dwarfs in the search area imaged by z02 .    in this article",
    ", we address flaws in each of these arguments .",
    "specifically , in @xmath1424 we show that ( 1 ) comparison with the spectrum of 2mass 0559@xmath31404 is invalidated by the fact that mz03 observed the wrong comparison star , and in fact the spectrum of s ori 70 is an excellent match to those of field t6t7 dwarfs ; ( 2 ) @xcite spectral model fits tend to be skewed toward lower surface gravities , and thus lower ages and masses , for late - type t dwarfs ; and ( 3 ) the identification of one foreground t dwarf in the z02 field is statistically consistent with the expected contamination .",
    "this analysis indicates that s ori 70 may simply be a foreground field t dwarf with a much older age and higher mass than reported by z02 and mz03 .",
    "we summarize our results in @xmath155 .",
    "young , low - mass brown dwarfs have much lower surface gravities than their evolved field counterparts ; @xmath6(cgs ) @xmath5 34 is typical for a 110 myr , 150 m@xmath1 object , versus 4.55.5 for a @xmath51 gyr field brown dwarf with similar t@xmath13 @xcite . as the abundances and band strengths of molecular species that dominate the photospheric opacity of cool brown dwarfs ( e.g. , h@xmath16o , ch@xmath12 , collision - induced h@xmath16 absorption ) are pressure - sensitive , the photospheric gas pressure , and hence surface gravity , can substantially influence the emergent spectral energy distribution .",
    "the @xmath17-band spectrum of s ori 70 presented in mz03 exhibits a distinct triangular - shaped spectral morphology which these authors argue is due to its low surface gravity .",
    "they draw an analogy with the peaked spectral morphologies of low - gravity l dwarfs in the trapezium cluster @xcite , although the latter data were obtained at @xmath18- and @xmath19-bands and not at @xmath17 . the low surface gravity argument of mz03",
    "is supported by a comparison with the spectrum of the presumably older , and hence higher surface gravity , field t dwarf 2mass 0559@xmath31404 , which appears in their figure 1 to have a very different @xmath17-band spectral morphology .",
    "however , their reported spectrum is not that of 2mass 0559@xmath31404 , but rather an adjacent background source .",
    "figure 1 compares the reported mz03 spectrum of 2mass 0559@xmath31404 to data obtained as part of the nirspec brown dwarf spectroscopic survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bdss ) ; and to a re - extraction of the raw data from mz03 using the redspec package ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the re - reduced spectrum of the comparison object observed by mz03 exhibits none of the hallmark features of mid- and late - type t dwarfs .",
    "thus , the differences noted by mz03 between s ori 70 and their field comparison star have nothing to do with surface gravity effects .    in fact , the triangular shape of the @xmath17-band spectrum of s ori 70 is common amongst mid- and late - type t dwarfs , the result of h@xmath16o and ch@xmath12 absorption wings on either side of the @xmath17-band peak @xcite .",
    "figure 2 compares the mz03 spectrum of s ori 70 to bdss data for the t7 field brown dwarf 2mass j15530228 + 1532369 @xcite .",
    "this object is presumably much older than the @xmath2010 myr @xmath2 orionis cluster given the similarity of its 12.5 @xmath4 spectrum to other t6t7 field dwarfs @xcite , which have space motions consistent with 15 gyr disk dwarfs @xcite , and the absence of any star forming regions in its vicinity .",
    "the match between the s ori 70 and 2mass 1553 + 1532 data is excellent , and similar good agreement is found with other t6 and t7 bdss spectra .",
    "hence , the @xmath17-band spectrum of s ori 70 is consistent with that of an old , high - gravity , late - type field t dwarf .",
    "both z02 and mz03 determine the surface gravity and t@xmath13 for s ori 70 by fitting their spectra to the most recent theoretical models from @xcite . in the absence of dynamical mass , radius , and bolometric",
    "flux measurements , the use of spectral models is required to derive these physical parameters , as the complexity of the spectra prohibit classical techniques such as curve of growth @xcite . however , despite substantial improvements over the past decade , these models do not yield reliable fits to the observed data , particularly when disentangling t@xmath13 and gravity @xcite .",
    "these limitations are largely due to incomplete or inaccurate molecular line lists and the uncertain treatment of photospheric condensates @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite find t@xmath13 discrepancies as high as 400 k between spectral model fits and luminosity - determined temperatures for the latest - type field l dwarfs .    to assess whether similar discrepancies occur in the t dwarf regime , we performed minimum @xmath21 fits of bdss @xmath17-band data for seven t6t7 field dwarfs using the same @xcite cond models as those used by mz03 .",
    "we sampled a grid of models spanning @xmath22 and 600 @xmath20 t@xmath13 @xmath20 1400 k in intervals of 0.5 dex and 100 k , respectively .",
    "both empirical and model spectra were gaussian smoothed to the instrumental resolution ( r @xmath5 2000 ) and interpolated onto identical wavelength scales .",
    "as parallax measurements are unavailable for most of these objects and s ori 70 , we performed the fits by normalizing the empirical and theoretical spectra at the 1.27 @xmath4 spectral peak .",
    "the @xmath21 deviation between the spectra was computed over the range 1.161.34 @xmath4 , minimizing over relative scalings of 0.81.2 .",
    "this procedure is similar to that employed by mz03 for s ori 70 .",
    "table 1 lists the best - fit model parameters for the spectral data , along with associated mass and age estimates from the @xcite evolutionary models .",
    "given that the objects examined in these fits are all field dwarfs , it is readily apparent that the derived parameters tend to be skewed toward lower gravities , and hence younger ages and lower masses , particularly for the t7 dwarfs .",
    "the most deviant case is that of gliese 570d , a widely - separated t8 brown dwarf companion to the nearby gliese 570 triple star system @xcite .",
    "assuming coevality , gliese 570d has a well - defined age of 25 gyr @xcite . on the contrary , the spectral model fits predict an age @xmath20 1 myr and mass @xmath20 1 m@xmath1 .",
    "figure 3 compares the minimum @xmath21 fit model for this object to one based on the more widely - adopted parameters @xmath23 and t@xmath13 = 800 k @xcite .",
    "the lower gravity model matches the overall j - band morphology better than the higher - gravity model , but predicts spiked features around 1.255 @xmath4 .",
    "these features do not coincide with ( presumably noise ) spikes seen at 1.265 @xmath4 in the s ori 70 spectrum , as is evident in figure 3 of mz03 .",
    "the inferior fit of the high gravity model is generally confined to the spectral peak , and may be the result of deep condensate opacity in this relatively transparent spectral region @xcite . regardless of the reason , it is clear that the best fit spectral models can yield skewed gravities for late - type field t dwarfs , resulting in underestimated ages and masses .",
    "hence , the spectral fit parameters for s ori 70 , which itself appears to be a late - type t dwarf , must be considered with skepticism .",
    "there are also inconsistencies between the @xmath17-band spectral model fits for s ori 70 from mz03 and the @xmath24 spectral model fits from z02 .",
    "the latter yield a substantially lower t@xmath13 ( 800 versus 1100 k ) and a somewhat higher surface gravity ( 4.0 versus 3.5 dex ) , which is in fact consistent with a 50 myr , not 8 myr , brown dwarf @xcite . while the differences between the parameter fits are within the reported uncertainties , they yield significantly incompatible spectral morphologies .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates this , comparing the @xmath24 spectrum from z02 to a smoothed @xcite model using the best fit parameters from mz03 .",
    "it is clear that this model grossly underestimates the strength of the 1.6 @xmath4 ch@xmath12 band and somewhat overestimates the flux at @xmath19-band . on the other hand , empirical spectral data for the field t6.5 2mass j10475385 + 2124234 @xcite , obtained with identical instrument settings , does fairly well at matching the @xmath18-band region , although it somewhat underestimates the flux at @xmath19-band .",
    "the latter disagreement , possibly due to differences in collision - induced h@xmath16 opacity , may be indicative of a somewhat lower surface gravity for s ori 70 relative to 2mass 1047 + 2124 @xcite , although signal - to - noise may also be an issue .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that empirical data for field t6t7 dwarfs reproduce the 1.11.3 @xmath4 and 1.52.4 @xmath4 spectra for s ori 70 more consistently than the theoretical models indicates both the unreliability of physical parameters derived from the model fits and the likelihood that s ori 70 is a foreground brown dwarf .",
    "a third argument used by z02 to establish cluster membership for s ori 70 is the low foreground contamination by field t dwarfs ( 0.080.3 objects ) expected in their 55.4 arcmin@xmath25 search area .",
    "we have computed an independent estimate of the foreground contamination using substellar luminosity function simulations from burgasser ( 2001 ) ; absolute photometry from @xcite and @xcite ; and an assumed limiting magnitude of @xmath26 ( z02 ) . for a substellar mass function @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we find 0.10.2 t dwarfs with 700 @xmath29 t@xmath13 @xmath29 1100 k ( typical for late - type t dwarfs ; burgasser 2001 ) expected in the z02 field , consistent with their estimates and certainly less than unity .    however , the relevant quantity is the likelihood of detecting one foreground object in the imaged area given the expected contamination rate .",
    "this confidence limit , cl , can be derived from poisson statistics : @xmath30 @xcite for @xmath31 source detected and an expected contamination of @xmath32 . for @xmath33 , eqn .",
    "1 yields @xmath34 , equivalent to 0.61.4 @xmath2 on a gaussian scale .",
    "hence , the presence of one foreground t dwarf in the z02 field is a 1@xmath2 event , and can not be ruled out statistically .",
    "based on the arguments above , we find compelling evidence that s ori 70 is not a member of the @xmath2 orionis cluster but rather a foreground field brown dwarf .",
    "this is not an unexpected result given the predicted @xmath530% contamination rate amongst l dwarfs in the @xmath2 orionis sample @xcite .",
    "indeed , quite a few @xmath2 orionis brown dwarf candidates have been ruled out as foreground objects in follow - up observations @xcite , and @xcite find the fraction of spectroscopically - verified candidates in @xmath2 orionis decreases toward fainter magnitudes .",
    "it should come as no surprise that the faintest candidate to date , s ori 70 , may be a contaminant field source .",
    "uncertainties in the spectral models and difficulty in obtaining high signal - to - noise spectra for this faint t dwarf ( @xmath35 ; z02 ) imply that unambiguous verification of cluster membership for s ori 70 will require measurement of its parallax and proper motion to establish spatial and kinematic association .",
    "such observations are hindered by the distance of this object even if it is a foreground brown dwarf .",
    "z02 measure an upper limit proper motion of @xmath36 yr@xmath37 for s ori 70 , which only restricts its distance to @xmath38 40 pc , roughly half the spectrophotometric distance if it is a field t6t7 dwarf ( @xmath5 75100 pc ; tinney , burgasser , & kirkpatrick 2003 ) .",
    "we conclude that s ori 70 has not been rigorously proven to be a member of the young @xmath2 orionis cluster .",
    "rather , observations obtained thus far are consistent with this object being a massive ( m @xmath5 3060 m@xmath1 assuming an age of 15 gyr ) foreground field brown dwarf .",
    "this interpretation should be seriously considered before assuming the existence of a `` cluster planet '' population in the @xmath2 orionis cluster .",
