    "autonomic nervous system ( ans ) , with its main two divisions ; sympathetic and parasympathetic , may be viewed as a hierarchically coordinated neuronal network .",
    "it regulates the exchange of energy and information with the environment [ 1 ] .",
    "most of the internal organs like the heart , gastrointestinal tract , lungs , urinary bladder and blood vessels are under the influence of the autonomic nervous system .",
    "usually the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have opposing effects on the organs .",
    "the degree of influence may vary and this determines the ultimate activity of that organ .",
    "the sympathetic nervous system is rapidly activated in physical or mental stressful conditions .",
    "it increases the heart rate , cardiac output and blood flow to the muscles .",
    "it dilates the pupil and decreases gastrointestinal tract activity .",
    "its action is therefore , sometimes aptly referred to as the flight or fight response . on the other hand ,",
    "the parasympathetic system decreases the heart rate and blood pressure , constricts the pupil and increases gastrointestinal activity .",
    "the rest and digest response is coined for its action[2 ] .",
    "the body maintains a proper balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity for appropriate functioning .",
    "a deviation from this balance may result in disease conditions like acute coronary syndrome , chronic heart failure , diabetes mellitus etc [ 3 ] .",
    "+ it has been shown that sensory inputs , like a harmonic auditory stimulus , can have a wide range of psychological and physical effects [ 4 ] .",
    "a sensory input can trigger a cascading series of events along the nerve down which it travels [ 5 ] .",
    "many of the beneficial effects of the auditory stimulus take their origin along the route of the impulse .",
    "music has the capacity to modify the psychobiological state of human .",
    "it can thus relieve stress and stress related ailments [ 6].gyrosonic is a novel auditory stimulus and appears to possess such capacity .",
    "when applied binaurally , it produces the perception of rotation of the audio source inside the brain .",
    "the frequency of this rotation is in the infrasonic region ( @xmath11hz ) .",
    "the perception of movement in the auditory space by human depends on a number of cues.it has been demonstrated that the moving sound produced by the sequential excitation of a mono source through several speakers in a free field , can generate a specific activity in the brain [ 7 ] .",
    "sound motion has been shown to evoke a magnetic field inside the brain , and the evoked magnetic response is specific to moving sound and is absent for non - moving sound stimulus [ 8 ] .",
    "another study has shown that the right parietal cortex is involved in the processing of sound motion [ 9 ] .",
    "compared to the earlier experiments gyrosonic stimulus has some improved rotational features .",
    "thus it can be expected that this may produce a larger spectrum of brain activation .",
    "earlier studies with this moving sound showed that the arousal level of psychosomatic patients was significantly reduced [ 10 ] .",
    "the heart rate variability ( hrv ) , which is a measure of the beat to beat fluctuation of the heart rate , reflects the time varying influence of ans and its components on the cardiovascular function . due to its non - invasive nature and convenience of the measurement , the hrv",
    "is often used to assess the influence of the autonomic nervous system on the cardiac function . under normal circumstances",
    "the hrv is regulated by the combined action of heart automaticity and the feedback elements from the vagal and sympathetic activity on the heart .",
    "the stimuli that are capable of altering the feedback components therefore change the dynamics of the heart .",
    "gyrosonic stimulus is assumed to be one such stimulus . in this paper",
    "we have estimated the influence of gyrosonic stimulus on the dynamics of the heart by assessing the heart rate variability ( hrv ) in response to this stimulus.the hrv can be assessed in time domain and in frequency domain .",
    "the time domain analysis provides quantitative measurement of the variation of heart rate , standard deviation sd , root mean square successive differences ( rmssd ) in rr-interval.on the other hand the frequency domain analysis of hrv mainly measures the high frequency ( hf ) and low frequency ( lf ) power spectrum of fluctuation of the rr interval .",
    "it has been suggested that the high frequency power spectrum is modulated by parasympathetic ( mainly vagal ) activity and the low frequency power spectrum is mainly influenced by both parts of ans activity [ 11,12 ] .",
    "dynamics of the cardiac system is nonlinear .",
    "hence it is reasonable to assume that a nonlinear analysis is more appropriate means to get an accurate idea about the cardiac system .",
    "poincare@xmath0 plot analysis meets this criterion [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] .",
    "it is a nonlinear geometric method of heart rate analysis .",
    "it is basically a scatter plot of any heart rate interval @xmath12 and next one @xmath13.when this plot is adjusted with an ellipse , three important parameters then define the plot.these are the length of the semi - minor axis of the ellipse sd1 , the length of the semi - major axis of the ellipse sd2 , and their ratio sd12.the parameter sd1 is the standard deviation of instantaneous beat to beat heart rate variability and it is the measure of short term variability of heart .",
    "it is mainly influenced by parasympathetic regulation on the heart .",
    "other parameter sd2 is the measure of long term variability .",
    "it has been shown that these parameters are correlated with the power spectral density of heart rate fluctuation .",
    "sd1 is correlated with the high frequency spectrum and sd2 is mainly associated with the low frequency spectrum [ 16].instead of taking the successive rr interval , the poincare@xmath0 plot can be generalized by taking a lag of greater than @xmath14 between rr intervals . a study with a lag of @xmath15",
    "has shown evidence of being superior to normal poincare@xmath0 [ 17 ] . moreover , a study on chronic heart failure patients has demonstrated strong dependency of the parameter sd12 on the lag interval .",
    "this study has also shown that the curvature of the plot of sd12 with various lag numbers is significantly different in patients and normal subjects .",
    "in chronic heart failure patients the curvature is much smaller [ 18 ] .",
    "another study on diabetic patients has pointed out that the sd1 decreases in diabetic patients with higher lag numbers [ 19 ] . using this lagged poincare@xmath0 plot",
    "it has been reported that sd1 and sd2 decreases with an increase in the lag number for smokers [ 20 ] .",
    "apart from the spectral analysis and poincare@xmath0 plot analysis for the heart rate variability , another method , called detrended fluctuation analysis , can be applied with some added advantages .",
    "it has been found that under healthy conditions , the rr interval time series exhibits long - range power law correlation .",
    "similar behavior has also been found in other physical systems [ 21 ] . the detrended fluctuation analysis proposed by peng et al",
    "is supposed to reflect on this long range correlation of the rr interval time series [ 22 , 23]and is widely used .    in our study",
    "we have used all these methods to examine the change in hrv in healthy subjects after the gyrosonic stimulation . through this study",
    "we propose to show that a change in the autonomic regulation occurs due to the influence of the gyrosonic stimuli .",
    "in this study we have used a gyrosonic stimuli constructed from an indian percussion instrument , the tabla .",
    "the stimuli were recorded digitally at a sampling rate of @xmath16 khz and in @xmath17 bit .",
    "then the amplitude of sound was modulated at @xmath18 hz in such a way that the amplitude increased in one ear and decreased in the other ear .",
    "this modulation created a perception of moving sound .",
    "when one ear heard the sound with higher amplitude it assumed the sound to be moving towards that ear whereas the ear hearing the lower amplitude sound took that the sound was moving away .",
    "this produced the effect as though the sound was moving in a horizontal plane around the head .",
    "there was a phase of @xmath19 seconds between the advancing or the rising and receding or the falling stimuli .",
    "the slopes of the amplitude of the rising or falling sound were exponential .",
    "the stimulus was presented through headphones , connected to a computer through a custom electronic interface .",
    "the sound was played at a sensation level around @xmath20 db .",
    "the ultimate perception produced was that of a rotating sound moving in a horizontal plane inside the brain .",
    "the duration of the stimuli was @xmath21 minutes .",
    "this duration was chosen to ensure that the subject perceived the effect in its optimum potential .",
    "no subject experienced nausea or episode of vertigo during or after the playback of the stimuli .",
    "the stimuli were given in a sound proof room with the subjects in recumbent position .",
    "thirty one subjects ( @xmath22 male , @xmath23 female with average age @xmath24 yrs ) volunteered for the study . all of the subjects were explained about the study and all of them gave their consent for the study .",
    "all the subjects were healthy and were not on any kind of medication .",
    "there was no history of any type of nervous system disorder .",
    "the study was approved by the ethical committee of iit kharagpur , india .",
    "ecg data was taken from three limb leads .",
    "patients were in supine condition .",
    "sampling rate was @xmath25 hz with a resolution of @xmath26 bit .",
    "a pre stimuli ecg was taken for @xmath27 mins .",
    "then the subjects listened to the gyrosonic stimulus .",
    "the post stimulation ecg for @xmath27 mins was recorded after a gap of @xmath27 mins from the end of the stimulation .",
    "whole @xmath27 mins data of ecg for both pre and post stimuli was analyzed after selecting the sinus beats only .",
    "ectopic beats were detected visually and deleted manually .",
    "rr interval or better to say normal beat to normal beat interval was detected through the origin software .",
    "the non linear analysis like the poincare@xmath0 plot and the dretended fluctuation analysis were done with program written in matlab software .",
    "the linear hrv analysis was done using standard program .",
    "during the analysis of hrv we have strictly followed the task force guideline of hrv analysis[13 ] . in linear time domain the heart rate ( hr ) , standard deviation ( sd ) of rr interval ( basically the normal beat to normal beat interval ) , root - mean squared successive differences ( rmsdd ) were calculated .",
    "the ratio of sd / rmsdd was considered to be a good measure of the sympatho - vagal balance [ 14 ] . in the frequency domain ,",
    "the power spectral density for the low frequency ( @xmath28-@xmath29 hz ) and the power spectral density for the high frequency ( @xmath30-@xmath31 hz ) were calculated .",
    "the distribution of power and the central frequency of lf and hf were not fixed .",
    "they usually vary in relation to changes in the autonomic modulation of the heart . according to the task force guideline",
    "the rmsdd represented the hf variability and the total variability of the rr interval data was reflected by the sd .",
    "the parameters sd1 and sd2 , as described earlier , were the width and the length of the ellipse .",
    "the ellipse was fitted to the poincare plot of rrn+m vs rrn where m is the lag number .",
    "sd1 and sd2 were calculated for lag m from the relation : sd1 = @xmath32 and sd2 = @xmath33 where the auto - covariance function @xmath34(m ) is given by +    @xmath35 = @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "[ 16 ] .",
    "the long term correlation in rr - time sequence was assessed by detrended fluctuation analysis [ 22 ] .",
    "the measure of correlation was given by a scaling exponent ( @xmath5 ) of the fluctuation function @xmath37 .",
    "the computation of fluctuation function @xmath38 was done in the following way . for a given time sequence @xmath39 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is characteristic time interval for the sequence and i=1,n ,",
    "an integrated time series @xmath42 was defined as @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath44 where @xmath45 was the mean of @xmath39 .",
    "the integrated series was divided into boxes of equal size of time @xmath46 and linear function was used to fit box data .",
    "the fluctuation function @xmath38 was calculated as root mean square fluctuations relative to the linear trend .",
    "the power law behaviour of @xmath38 provided the scaling exponent .",
    "it has been observed that acceptable estimate of the scaling exponent @xmath5 ( from dfa ) can be obtained from analysis of data sets of length @xmath47 samples or greater ( equivalent to approximately @xmath48 min for rr data at a heart rate of @xmath49 bpm ) .",
    "the analysis of rr data for period of @xmath27 min time interval was therefore expected to provide an adequate measure of the scaling exponent .",
    "the results of linear analysis of hrv is summarized in figs.1 .",
    "the fig.1 depicts the mean value of hr , the mean of sd and rmssd in rr - interval of all subjects . in all figures presented here",
    "the term pre and pst indicate respectively before and after gyrosonic stimulation .",
    "the heart rate was changed from @xmath50 to @xmath51 per min .",
    "the slowing down of hr was found to be more for subject with higher initial hr .",
    "both sd and rmssd were increased in post stimulation .",
    "the lf and hf components of spectral power in rr - interval were also increased after stimulation ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the increase in lf- power was more than that of hf component .",
    "however , the ratio of lf / hf power was decreased in post condition.the changes of all the above parameters are with @xmath52    in fig.2 the lagged poincare@xmath0 plot of a subject was presented with lag of 1,5,9 and 13 plot .",
    "the left and right part of the figure represent respectively the situation before and after gyrosonic stimulus . as lag number increased the plot",
    "became more scattered with consequent increase in both width and length of the plot .",
    "after stimulation the @xmath53 vs @xmath54 plot were more scattered , and center of the plot was shifted to higher value indicating slower heart rate .",
    "the group average values of parameters sd1 , sd2 ( both in sec . ) and sd12 ( sd1/sd2 ) obtained from corresponding values of individual subject were plotted against lagged number m ( fig.3 points ) , both parameters sd1 and sd2 were increasing function of lagged number.after gyrosonic stimulation ( pst ) their values were higher than those before stimulation ( pre ) and the growth rate of sd1 with m is also higher .",
    "the result points out that the gyrosonic stimulation can enhance both short and long time correlation of heart beat .",
    "the ratio sd12 ( points ) in post stimulation state was higher than that in pre - state and the difference increased with lag number .",
    "the difference between the values of all three parameters before and after stimulation was found to be significant ( @xmath55 ) . in order to find the relationship of these parameters with lag number m the method of pade@xmath0 approximant [ 23 ] was used .",
    "assuming simple form of the pade@xmath0 approximant for sd s as + @xmath56 the ratio of polynomial in m of degree one . here",
    "y = sd1 , sd2 or sd12 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 were taken as the new unknown parameters .",
    "the above equation was chosen by examining trend for small m and large m. for small m , y increased linearly and deviated at higher m. as shown below , the equ.(1 ) was found to be an excellent representation of the observed dependence of sd s on m ( solid line in fig.3 ) . when expressed for small m the equ.(1 ) can be approximated as @xmath60 where l = @xmath61 and q = - @xmath62 .",
    "it is to be noted that such variation of these parameters for small m were also found earlier [ 18 ] .",
    "the values for l and q were given in table 1 .",
    "it was evident that the magnitude of slope and curvature of sd1 after gyrosonic stimulation were increased considerably .",
    "on the other hand , the linear coefficient for sd2 increased slightly and curvature remained essentially unaltered .",
    "the ratio sd12 for different m for each subject was calculated and the mean value of the ratio was plotted with m in fig.3 ( points in lower curve ) .",
    "the data were excellently fitted by the equation ( 1 ) ( solid curve ) with the parameters value noted in table.1 .",
    "the ratio sd12 exhibited a larger change in both slope and curvature .",

    "the value of parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath65 obtained from fit of eq.(1 ) with respective value of @xmath66.the parameters l and q are the coefficient of linear and quadratic terms in expansion of y in terms of m. values of @xmath2 , l and q for sd1 and sd2 are in second . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     similar analysis was performed for individual subject and it was found that the equation ( 1 ) represented quite well with @xmath67 .",
    "the values of l and q for individual subject for pre and post - stimulation were depicted in fig.4 . except for few ( five to six )",
    "subjects the slope and magnitude of curvature increased after gyrosonic stimulation .",
    "earlier study on subjects with cardiac illness had shown that the curvature of sd1 and sd12 curves were much reduced compared to those for normal subjects [ 17 ] .",
    "based on this result it can be argued that the augmentation of the curvature due to gyrosonic stimulation can then be taken as an indicator of better cardio - dynamics .",
    "the gyrosonic may be acting as a reward signal for improvement of sympathovagal balance .",
    "+ the coefficient @xmath5 and its distribution of detrended fluctuation analysis for subjects was plotted in fig.5a and 5b respectively for pre and post state of stimulation .",
    "the gyrosonic stimulation produced a decrease in the coefficient @xmath5 for most of subjects and mean for the group is lowered .",

    "it is to be noted that no significant changes were found in the above mentioned parameters in a group of subjects when we used various monotonous single frequency sound stimulation instead of gyrosonic stimuli .",
    "the ecg data for short duration ( @xmath27 min ) is used to analyze the heart rate variability in time and frequency domain in order to assess the influence of novel gyro - sonic stimulation .",

    "is represented by an equation that fits excellently the data of sd s for group average and individual .",
    "the coefficients of linear and quadratic ( curvature ) term of @xmath71 ( and @xmath72 ) vs m relationship are enhanced due to gyrosonic stimulation.the equation ( 1 ) is an important findind as it provides the quantitative maesure of variation of sd12 with m - in particular the curvature of the plot which as appears from this and earlier [ 18 ] can be taken as a good measure of state of cardio-dynamics.the coefficient @xmath5 of dfa is also decreased in post stimulation state .",
    "gyrosonic stimulation of short duration reduces the heart rate and enhances sd and rmssd . in frequency domain both lf and hf power",
    "are higher in post stimulation condition .",
    "the trend of the changes of most of the indicators of hrv supports the hypothesis that gyrosonic has the capacity to influence sympatho - vagal regulation in a favorable way and the gyrosonic can be considered as reward signal for improvement of autonomic activity .",
    "the importance of sympatho - vagal regulation on various diseases has already established.so , there is a possibility that the gyrosonic may act through improvement in autonomic regulation .",
