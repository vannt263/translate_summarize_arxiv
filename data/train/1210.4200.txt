    "detection and study of photospheric magnetic field changes during solar flares can aid in a better understanding of the mechanisms of energy buildup and release in flares . despite these observations ,",
    "most models of flares assume that these events are coronal and that no photospheric magnetic field changes occur over the flare duration @xcite .",
    "ideally , coronal field models should be based on boundary conditions observed in the lower atmosphere . however , it is not clear how to relate the restructuring of approximately force - free or current - free coronal field with the changes in the forced photosphere .",
    "a few possible mechanisms were offered in past works that could cause the sudden and permanent photospheric field changes observed .",
    "the most frequently mentioned processes are the emergence of new magnetic flux and changes in the direction of the field @xcite . supporting magnetic flux emergence as a possible mechanism ,",

    "suggested the alfvn wave scenario as an explanation for the observed rapid variations in the line - of - sight component of the photospheric magnetic field in the flare impulsive phase : large - scale alfvn wave pulses may transport both energy and changes in the magnetic field rapidly from the flare site in the corona to the lower atmosphere .",

    "the change in magnetic flux may be a more important physical quantity than the largest local field change at one particular location . by only picking up representative pixels with the fastest and largest field changes , free of artifacts @xcite",
    ", one may not capture a complete picture of the changes in the magnetic field in the region .",
    "however , the value of magnetic flux changes may capture the effects of flares on the entire active region .",
    "the calculations of magnetic flux made by past authors have either summed the flux of changing pixels over the entire active region @xcite or confined attention to simple bipolar active regions with highly sheared neutral lines ( _ e.g. _ ; ) . in the present work",
    "the active regions are divided into magnetic features ( substructures ) whose flux changes are calculated individually .",
    "this allows us to identify which parts of a region change significantly and also to investigate the interactions among different features in an active region .",
    "one of the processes involving magnetic features associated with flares is flux cancellation .",
    "flux cancellation plays an important role in some theories of solar eruptions ( _ e.g. _ ; ) .",
    "it is found to be essential for the formation of prominences @xcite , and may possibly trigger filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for flux cancellation is suggested to be a necessary condition of flare initiation as a part of slow reconnection processes in the lower atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the first evidence of the possibility of magnetic reconnection in flux cancellation was presented by , who analyzed vector magnetic field changes and demonstrated how features previously not directly connected by transverse fields partially reconnected during flux cancellation .",
    "strong observational evidence of magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere leading to instability and flare / coronal mass ejection ( cme ) events was presented by , , and .",
    "reconnection can occur at different levels of the solar atmosphere ; above , below , or at the photospheric level @xcite .",
    "observed that magnetic flux disappeared in the chromosphere earlier than in the photosphere at the cancellation sites , which suggests submergence of the flux implying that reconnection occurs above the photosphere .",
    "confirms this finding . however , reported flux cancellation , following a c - class flare , with the presence of upflows in the canceling feature , which suggests the reconnection below or at the level of the photosphere . in the case of the formation of prominences ,",
    "cancellation is explained by the emergence of u - shaped loops @xcite .",
    "most of these studies suggest flux cancellation as a pre - flare condition , with some exceptions ( _ e.g. _ ) .",
    "photospheric magnetic shear increases have been observed to occur during and after flares @xcite , and before and during flares @xcite . in this work , we estimate flux cancellation in the magnetic features at the polarity inversion line ( pil ) associated with a major flare , at the time before , during , and after the flare .",
    "in this study full - disk photospheric magnetograms from the gong sites are used .",
    "gong full - disk magnetograms are obtained with a 1-minute cadence , 2.5-arcsec pixel size , and a noise level of 3 gauss ( g ) per pixel .",
    "we have analyzed 77 sets of gong magnetograms for 38 x- and 39 m - class flares .",
    "we confined our attention to the most energetic flares with the best data coverage .",
    "we eliminated all flares of geostationary operational environmental satellite ( goes ) class weaker than m5.0 and all with an apparent central meridian distance ( longitude distance from central meridian ) greater than @xmath0 .",
    "we further limited our attention to those flares for which gong magnetograms are available over approximately 1 hour before and after the flare .",

    "we use the yet another feature tracking algorithm ( yafta ) feature - tracking code @xcite to decompose the field into individual magnetic features and to study their evolution and interplay during the flare .",
    "we have used yafta s `` downhill '' algorithm to group together more than four pixels lying on the same `` hill '' in the absolute field strength above 100 g. the 100 g threshold identifies active region fields in gong magnetograms .",
    "small features often have short lifetimes .",
    "the smallest feature that showed abrupt and permanent flux change in this work consisted of eight pixels ( which is @xmath2 0.5 heliographic degrees in diameter ) , and the biggest one was 650 pixels ( @xmath2 3 degrees in diameter ) .",
    "the program accomplishes matching of features between two consecutive magnetograms .",
    "most of the features fragment , merge , appear , and disappear between the magnetograms , which makes the matching process complex . as a result , features change their labels .",
    "only features that do not appear , disappear , fragment , or merge between the magnetograms `` propagate '' themselves ; they keep their label through all steps .    to track distinct magnetic features , for each flaring active region we identify the features on a reference image composed of ten magnetograms immediately preceding the flare .",
    "if some of these ( two or more ) feature - hills appear as a single feature - hill in most of the frames during the whole analyzed time interval and each of the individual features does not show significant temporal variations , they are merged into one feature on the reference image .",
    "an example of an active region with 18 magnetic features found is shown in figure 1(a ) .",
    "we locate each of these features on each of our images .",

    "the locations of abrupt flux decreases ( blue circles ) and increases ( red circles ) of magnetic features found in this work are overplotted . ]",
    "most of the previous feature - tracking works have applied a radial field correction to the magnetograms before processing , dividing the longitudinal fields by the cosine of the heliocentric angle ( _ e.g. _ ) . for most photospheric fields",
    "this is generally a valid assumption @xcite .",
    "however , for the photospheric fields in a flaring active region , particularly those fields associated with strong , twisted magnetic structures directly involved in the eruption , this assumption may not be applicable .",
    "reported evidence of this in the result that the average magnitude of photospheric field changes tends to increase as a function of distance from the disk center , indicating that the fields changing the most tend to be nearly horizontal .",
    "the radial field correction is necessary when features inside of an active region are tracked for a long period of time to ensure a constant threshold during the whole tracking interval ( _ e.g. _ , see ) , while we track features only up to 4 h.",
    "we analyze the magnitude and sign of flux changes in each magnetic feature during a flare . the magnitude and sign of flux changes",
    "are defined by fitting the time evolution of the total flux in each magnetic feature from before the onset to the end of a flare with a straight line , assuming that the flux evolution around the flare is linear and ignoring long - term variations and trends .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates an example of the strongest field change found in our analysis .",
    "the spread in the points is mainly caused by seeing changes in the earth s atmosphere with some contribution from ongoing solar field changes .",
    "we selected magnetic features showing stepwise flux changes during flares .",
    "each of the flux changes satisfies the following criterion .",
    "the value of the flux change should exceed 1.3 @xmath5 of the scatter in the measured background flux .",
    "the background flux is defined as a median value of the pre - flare flux in the feature .",

    "the correlation appears to work better for regions at disk - center locations than far from the disk center , suggesting that it is the radial flux loss that correlates best with the peak x - ray flux .",
    "we need vector magnetic field data to know the radial flux ( not the nearly horizontal field seen in the line - of - sight magnetograms near the limb ) to confirm this conjecture .      measured the total magnetic flux ( @xmath12 ) near the pil and proposed this quantity as a measure for major flare potential rather than the total flux in an active region . in this work ,",

    "such strong - gradient pils are generally associated with flux emergence and flux cancellation driven by photospheric flows . the net flux change in the pil features during its time evolution from before to after the flare shows that the pil flux decreases before the flare outnumber the increases in x - class flares , while m - class flares show an approximately equal number of flares with pil flux increases and decreases .",

    "this figure suggests that the magnetic flux loss , the total flux in the active region , and total flux in the canceling features are not correlated with the radial position of the region on the disk .",
    "the magnetic fields related to these categories have no apparent directional preferences , whereas figures 4(c ) and 4(d ) show correlation between the flux changes and the radial position , consistent with nearly horizontal fields .",

    "the active region was located at the coordinates of noaa 10486 three rotations earlier , which was associated with halloween s flare . after two following rotations ( noaa 10508 and 10523 ) , the active region almost completely decayed . in another rotation ,",
    "new flux emerged on the front side of the region and evolved into noaa 10540 , hosting a few c - class and m - class flares .",
    "three other flares ( an m9.1 flare on 8 november 2001 , an m9.1 flare on 22 july 2004 , and an m6.0 flare on 5 september 2001 ) that took place at near disk - center locations ( @xmath2 0.48 , 0.35 , and 0.49 solar radii ) did not involve multi - step flux cancellations . in the first flare , the active region had a diffuse structure and a short pil . in the last two flares ,",
    "the region was concentrated and had large total magnetic flux , but the total flux in the pil features was lower than the median value of that for all the active regions analyzed .",
    "all active regions that hosted x - class flares in the near disk - center locations involved flux cancellation events .",
    "the absence of flux cancellation events around the x - class flares is generally seen in active regions with flares far from the disk center . however , we note the opposite cases in which some active regions with flares close to the limb locations involved significant flux cancellations during m- and x - class flares ( see tables 7 and 8 for details ) .",
    "they are the x20.0 flare on 2 april 2001 ( noaa 9393 ) , m5.7 on 7 november 2001 ( noaa 9690 ) , m7.1 on 26 december 2001 ( noaa 9742 ) , m6.8 on 20 december 2002 ( noaa 10226 ) , m7.6 on 26 october 2003 ( noaa 10484 ) , x1.5 on 17 march 2003 ( noaa 10314 ) , and x6.5 on 6 december 2006 ( noaa 10930 ) .",
    "all of the active regions had concentrated , essentially balanced flux of both polarities and long and tight ( strong ) pils .",
    "do the flux cancellation events correlate with stepwise flux changes during the flares ?",
    "the estimated amount of flux cancellation during some flares indicates a very large amount of flux loss ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "we select the set of canceling features that contributed to the flux loss over the entire 4-h interval around a flare and consider also the subset of these features whose flux loss occurred only over the duration of the flare . among these two sets of canceling features",
    ", we have counted the number of features which involve stepwise flux changes .",
    "we have compared 45 flares where at least one magnetic feature with stepwise flux change was found .",
    "table 13 shows that only a small portion of magnetic features involving flux cancellation showed stepwise flux changes ; thus we find no relationship between these two types of events .",
    "the lack of relationship between the stepwise field changes and the cancellation suggests that the photospheric cancellation process is independent of the abrupt flare - related field changes .    @",
    "l @ * 4c @ number & & + of features & during flare & total & during flare & total + stepwise flux change & 0 & 2 & 4 & 13 + no stepwise flux change & 19 & 47 & 37 & 79 +",
    "we have analyzed magnetic flux changes and studied flux cancellations related to 77 major flares .",
    "the results of this work can be summarized as follows .",
    "we found that significantly more magnetic flux decreases occur during flares than increases .",
    "this result is consistent with the model of magnetic implosion and collapsing loop structure proposed by .",
    "the change in the longitudinal magnetic field is larger in a region close to the limb , indicating that the involved field component is nearly horizontal .",
    "the x - class flares show larger flux changes and stronger bias towards flux decreases in comparison with m - class flares .",
    "both net and total flux changes show an increasing trend with the flare strength .",
    "we find that a linear correlation between the flux changes and the goes peak x - ray flux is dominated by x - class flares at limb locations , in agreement with the study of .",
    "we identified episodes of flux cancellation and estimated the amount of flux canceled during three intervals around each flare : before the flare onset , during the flare , and after the flare end .",
    "we found that the amount of canceled flux is generally greater over the time during the flare than before and after the flare .",
    "this tendency is mostly contributed from x - class flares .",
    "some of the strongest x - class flares showed significantly greater flux loss during the flare time .",
    "m - class flares did not show a significant bias in the amount of flux canceled during either time frame .",
    "the flux loss is approximately equally correlated with the number of canceling features and the total flux in these features .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the field strength and complexity are approximately equally important in the flux cancellation processes during flaring activity .",
    "the increasing trend of the flux losses as a function of the flare power is mostly explained by this correlation for the disk - center x - class flares , but not for the limb x - class flares .",
    "a less significant correlation between the flux losses and the total flux in the active region is also found for the flares at disk - center locations , dominated by the x - class flares .",
    "the flux loss is correlated with the peak x - ray flux for both disk - center and limb x - class flares .",
    "thus , the correlation between the flare strength and both the flux losses and the flux changes is dominated by x - class flares .",
    "we find that strong magnetic fields at pils are associated with the occurrence of large flares , in agreement with .",
    "the correlation with the flare strength is higher for the flux loss than for the total flux in canceling features .",
    "we did find contraction of the field towards the neutral line in the form of flux cancellation events , but we found no correlation between the flux cancellation and the abrupt , stepwise photospheric field changes associated with coronal field implosion during flares .",
    "we speculate that the stepwise changes and flux cancellation could be unrelated in general , as the stepwise flux changes may be caused by coronal magnetic restructuring while the flux cancellation may be caused by photospheric dynamics .    for future study , vector magnetic field data are needed to better interpret the longitudinal field changes .",
    "high - cadence , high - sensitivity full vector data from the synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun ( solis ) and the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) will be very useful .",
    "also a combined analysis of chromospheric and coronal data is needed to clarify the following : are the canceling features part of the emerging u - loops or submerging @xmath68-loops ?",
    "are the cancellations associated with reconnection ?",
    "does the reconnection occur above or below the photosphere ?",
