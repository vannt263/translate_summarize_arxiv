    "time - resolved experiments are used to monitor time - dependent phenomena .",
    "the study of dynamics in physical systems often requires time resolution beyond the picosecond capabilities presently available with synchrotron radiation .",
    "femtosecond ( @xmath0s ) capabilities have been available for many years at visible wavelengths .",
    "there exists a wide interest in the extension of femtosecond techniques to the soft x - ray , and x - ray regions of spectrum .",
    "the time resolution of pump - probe experiment is , obviously , determined by the duration of the pump as well as the resolution of the probing",
    ". the pump pulse must always be as short as the desired time resolution .",
    "in typical scheme of a pump - probe experiment ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pps1 ] ) the short probe pulse follows the pump pulse at some specified delay .",
    "the signal recorded by the slow detector then reflects the state of the sample during the brief probing .",
    "the experiment must be repeated many times with different delays in order to reconstruct the femtosecond dynamical process @xcite .",
    "the obvious temporal limitation of the typical visible pump / x - ray probe technique is the duration of the x - ray probe . here",
    "we will concentrate on the performance obtained with third - generation storage rings . at these sources ,",
    "the x - ray pulse duration is about 100 ps .",
    "the new principle of pump - probe techniques described below offers a way around this difficulty . we propose visible pump / x - ray probe technique that would allow time resolution up to femtosecond capabilities to be recovered from a long x - ray probe pulses",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pps2 ] ) .",
    "the principle of operation of the proposed pump - probe scheme is essentially based on the statistical properties of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "synchrotron radiation is a stochastic object and at a given time it is impossible to predict the amount of energy which flows to a sample . for any synchrotron light beam there",
    "exist some characteristic time , which determines the time - scale of the random fluctuations .",
    "this characteristic time is called , in general , the coherence time @xmath1 of the synchrotron light beam .",
    "its magnitude is of the order of the inverse of the frequency spread of the beam . in all the theory that follows ,",
    "attention is restricted to synchrotron light beams whose frequency spreads are small compared with the mean frequency , that is , where @xmath2 is very much larger than unity .",
    "figure [ fig : int ] illustrates the type of fluctuations that occur in the synchrotron radiation beam intensity and phase .",
    "the figures have been constructed by a computer simulation of a synchrotron light source in which the summation is carried out explicitly for the real number of electrons @xmath3 in the electron bunch .",
    "it is seen that substantial changes in intensity ( and phase ) occur over a time span @xmath1 , but these quantities are reasonably constant over time intervals @xmath4 .",
    "our technique utilizes the fact that , over the long probe pulse , time correlations exist in the probe pulse intensity .",
    "it was shown that the femtosecond timescale associated with intensity fluctuations in synchrotron light pulses make them well suited for time - resolved studies .",
    "the first statistical quantity of interest is the variance of the detector counts .",
    "the statistics of concern are defined over an ensemble of synchrotron radiation pulses . from a set of variances measured as a function of correlation time it is possible to reconstruct the femtosecond dynamical process .",
    "the shot noise in the electron beam causes fluctuations of the beam density which are random in time and space . as a result ,",
    "the radiation , produced by such a beam , has random amplitudes and phases in time and space .",
    "these kinds of radiation fields can be described in terms of statistical optics , branch of optics that has been developed intensively during the last few decades and there exists a lot of experience and a theoretical basis for the description of fluctuating electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we will begin in this section by dealing with some general notions of statistical optics",
    ". some of the statements will be quite precise , other only partially precise . in the framework of statistical optics the radiation field",
    "is characterized by notions such as time and space coherence .",
    "let us illustrate these notions .",
    "to be specific , we consider the radiation pulse of nearly monochromatic radiation having a duration and bandwidth equal to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . if @xmath7 , the radiation is partially coherent in time .",
    "the time coherence is of about @xmath8 .",
    "the physical sense of this notion is as follows .",
    "let us separate the radiation pulse by a splitter .",
    "these two pulses pass different path lengths and are then combined together .",
    "if the difference between the path lengths is less than @xmath9 , we see the interference pattern at the end for a shot - to - shot averaging ( averaging over a large number of radiation pulses ) . using simple physical language",
    ", we can say that the radiation field is correlated within the time of coherence .",
    "the notion of space coherence can be explained in the same way .",
    "let us direct the radiation onto a screen with two pinholes and look at the interference pattern in the far diffraction zone when changing the distance between the pinholes .",
    "when the pinholes are located close to each other , we see a clear diffraction pattern . as the distance between the holes increases to some value , @xmath10 , we come to the situation when we do not see an interference pattern after averaging over the ensemble of pulses .",
    "qualitatively , the value of @xmath11 is referred as the area of coherence of the radiation pulse .",
    "the coherence volume is defined as the product of the coherence area , @xmath11 , with the coherence length , @xmath9 .",
    "if one uses the notions of quantum mechanics , this volume corresponds to one cell in the phase space of the photons .",
    "the number of photons in the coherence volume is also referred to as the degeneracy parameter , @xmath12 .",
    "physically this parameter means the average number of photons which can interfere , or the number of photons in one quantum state ( one mode ) .",
    "it should be noted that third - generation synchrotron light sources can produce soft x - ray radiation with very high degeneracy parameter and in such cases we can state that the classical approach is adequate for a description of the statistical properties of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "electron beam is composed of large number of electrons , thus fluctuations always exist in the electron beam density due to the effect of shot noise .",
    "when the electron beam enters the undulator , the presence of the beam modulation at frequencies close to the resonance frequency initiates the process of radiation .",
    "the shot noise in the electron beam is a gaussian random process .",
    "the monochromator can be considered as a linear filter which does not change the statistics of the signal . as a result",
    ", we can define general statistical properties of the radiation after monochromator without any calculations .",
    "for instance , the real and imaginary parts of the slowly varying complex amplitudes of the electric field of the electromagnetic wave have a gaussian distribution , the instantaneous radiation power fluctuates in accordance with the negative exponential distribution , and the energy in the radiation pulse fluctuates in accordance with the gamma distribution .",
    "we can also state that the spectral density of the radiation energy and the first - order time correlation function should form a fourier transform pair ( this is so - called wiener khintchine theorem ) .",
    "also , the higher - order correlation functions ( time and spectral ) should be expressed in terms of the first - order correlation functions .",
    "these properties are well known in statistical optics as properties of completely chaotic polarized radiation @xcite .",
    "this demonstrate one of the most beautiful things about statistical optics - how much can be deduced from so little .",
    "this brings up an interesting question : why is it that the noise in the electron bunch is a gaussian random process ?",
    "we will give an explanation in section 3 .",
    "the arrangement of components for a long probe pulse experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pps5 ] . in order to use the radiation from synchrotron light source it first has to be spatially filtered and monochromatized .",
    "we assume that synchrotron radiation reaching the sample surface has full transverse coherence . with this assumption ,",
    "attention can be concentrated completely on temporal coherence effects .",
    "the coherence time of synchrotron light is inversely proportional to the monochromator bandwidth .",
    "so the narrower we make the monochromator exit slit , the wider the coherence time gets .",
    "any measurement of photodetector counts will be accompanied by certain unavoidable fluctuations and we wish to determine the statistical distribution of the number of photocounts observed in any radiation pulse .",
    "now we wish to consider one example which shows the relationship between the fluctuations of photocounts and the coherence time in a circumstances that easy to understand .",
    "we will not discuss applications of the proposed pump - probe scheme .",
    "there are , in fact , many applications that could be discussed .",
    "we have chosen for emphasis here experiments aimed at measuring the lifetime of electronic excitation in condensed matter . for our present purposes we would like to imagine a somewhat idealized experiment .",
    "several assumptions are made about the process of internal conversion of the electronic excitation .",
    "first , the time dependence of the electronic occupation is assumed to be known a priory  this is the exponential dependence @xmath13 . in practice , this is a good assumption .",
    "the purpose of the measurement is presumably to determine the lifetime @xmath14 .",
    "the typical lifetime of the electronic excitation is in the femtosecond range .",
    "this type of time - resolved experiments may be understood as preparing an excited state with a pump pulse and then projecting it with a probe pulse onto a final state .",
    "the final state should be well characterized .",
    "photoionization detection has several advantages .",
    "the ion state may be well characterized by independent methods such as high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy .",
    "schematic ionization scheme for pump - probe ionization is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pps8 ] .",
    "a typical experiment would be to couple two electronic state @xmath15 and @xmath16 resonantly by a femtosecond pump - field at a frequency @xmath17 in the visible range .",
    "the dynamics is then probed by ionization and detection of the photoelectrons as a function of the coherence time of the probe synchrotron radiation pulse .",
    "a time - resolved experiment inherently begins with the initiation of the process under study , at some more or less accurately defined instant in time .",
    "we assume that the pump pulse can be approximated by a @xmath18-function . with that simplifying assumption ,",
    "the number of photoelectrons @xmath19 detected during a synchrotron radiation pulse is directly proportional to the integrated value of the physical parameter ( occupation number ) to be measured :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the instantaneous intensity of synchrotron radiation . at time",
    "@xmath22 the pump pulse perturbs the sample . here",
    "we assume that the pump - probe process under consideration can be separated from what might be called parasitic processes .",
    "in practice , not every count will be detected , and some false counts will register .",
    "we are not considering such details because our interest is in the fundamental aspects of the problem .",
    "a quantity of considerable physical interest is the variance of the photocount distribution    @xmath23    determination of the variance @xmath24 as a function of the monochromator bandwidth @xmath25 gives us information on the lifetime @xmath14 .",
    "first , for a lifetime @xmath14 that is much shorter than the coherence time @xmath1 of the probe pulse , the number of photoelectrons is to an excellent approximation , simply the product of the instantaneous intensity and the lifetime @xmath14",
    ",    @xmath26    within the scaling factor , therefore , the probability density function of @xmath19 is approximately the same as the density function of the instantaneous intensity . using the well - known results obtained in the framework of statistical optics",
    ", we can state that when the lifetime is much shorter than the inverse of the monochromator bandwidth , the variance tends to unity :    @xmath27    at the opposite extreme , with a lifetime much longer than the coherence time , the fact that many independent fluctuations of the instantaneous intensity occur within the interval @xmath14 implies , according to the theory of completely chaotic light , that the variance is inversely proportional to the monochromator bandwidth .",
    "so , we obtain the rule that the product of lifetime and monochromator bandwidth is of the order of    @xmath28    this relation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pps6 ] , which shows the parameter @xmath29 plotted against @xmath30 .",
    "the exact results can in fact be found for certain monochromator line shapes using the formalism introduced in section 2 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath29 on the exact shape of the signal and of the monochromator profile is rather weak and can be ignored outside the range @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to note that the photocount fluctuations discussed above originate from the shot noise in the electron beam . nevertheless , the problem of photocount fluctuations is more complicated and there is another ( parasitic ) fluctuation effect that can be important for the proposed pump - probe experiments .",
    "the problem is the time jitter of electron bunch and pump pulse .",
    "any measurement of photocounts will be accompanied by these unavoidable fluctuations . to solve this problem , femtosecond pump pulses from the laser system",
    "should be synchronized to the master clock of the storage ring rf system with phase - locking technique . at present",
    "the best achievable synchronization between the optical laser and the synchrotron light source is of the order of a few picoseconds . on the other hand",
    "the electron bunch length is about of 100 ps . assuming that the electron bunch envelope is gaussian distribution ( in practice , this is a good assumption ) we can find that the parasitic photocount variance reaches a value of about a per cent only .",
    "thus we find that pump pulse jitter should not be a serious limitation in our case .",
    "the next problem is to define the sensitivity of the proposed pump - probe method",
    ". a general study of the noise fluctuations associated with the photoevents would be nontrivial .",
    "the difficulty arises in simultaneously including the effects of both the classically induced fluctuations and poisson noise fluctuations associated with the basic interaction of light and matter .",
    "the ratio of the classical variance to the `` photon noise '' variance is named as a photocount degeneracy parameter @xmath32 ( see section 4 ) . physically speaking",
    ", the count degeneracy parameter can be interpreted as the average number of counts that occur in a single coherence interval of the incident ( transversely coherent ) radiation .",
    "it can also be described as the average number of counts per `` degree of freedom '' or per `` mode '' of the incident wave . when @xmath33 , it is highly probable that there will be no more than one count per coherence interval of the wave , with the result that quantum noise predominates over classically induced noise . on the other hand , when @xmath34 , there are many photoevents presented in each coherence interval of the wave .",
    "the result is a `` bunching '' of the photoevents by the classical intensity fluctuations , and an increase of the variance of the counts to the point where the classically induced fluctuations are far stronger than the quantum noise variations .",
    "let us consider the case when the degeneracy parameter is much larger than unity , @xmath34 .",
    "the fluctuations of the photoevents are defined mainly by the classical noise in this case and the signal - to - noise ratio for the proposed device can be written in the form    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the number of independent measurements averaged in the accumulator ( total number of shots ) . the determination of the signal - to - noise ratio is a nontrivial problem .",
    "fortunately , in the particular case , namely , @xmath37 , a much simplified analysis is sufficient . in this case the expression ( [ eq : sn ] ) can be reduced to    @xmath38    the signal - to - noise ratio depends on the degeneracy parameter when @xmath32 is much less than unity . in this case",
    "one can derive that    @xmath39    the significance of the result we have obtained can not be fully appreciated until we determine typical values of the degeneracy parameter that can be expected in practice .",
    "let us consider the case of radiation with a sufficiently long coherence time that @xmath37 . under such condition",
    ", the photocount degeneracy parameter can be estimated simply as ( see section 5 )    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the quantum efficiency of photoelectron production , @xmath42 is the monochromator throughput , @xmath43 is the radiation wavelength , @xmath44 is the peak spectral brightness .",
    "our physical interpretation of the result ( [ eq : sn1 ] ) is as follows . in order to use the radiation from the undulator",
    "it first has to be spatially filtered and monochromatized ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pps5 ] ) .",
    "we interpret the factor @xmath45 as representing the number of photons per coherence interval at the monochromator exit , whereas the factor @xmath30 represents a ratio of integration time @xmath14 to coherence interval @xmath46 .",
    "let us present a specific numerical example for the case of a third - generation synchrotron light source .",
    "the spectral brightness delivered by an undulators at a wavelength of @xmath47 nm is about @xmath48 photons / s/0.1%bw/@xmath49 and the degeneracy parameter is about @xmath50 for the case when @xmath51 .",
    "as we mentioned above , the dependence of @xmath52 on the exact shape of the signal is rather weak . as a result , the behaviour of the variance as a function of synchrotron radiation coherence time provides only very little information on the sample dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , the described pump - probe technique can be used to quote a `` characteristic time '' of the sample dynamics .",
    "the typical procedure is to assume a signal shape ( generally exponential shape ) , and to `` determine '' the relaxation time @xmath14 from the known ratio between the @xmath53 and @xmath24 .",
    "a more complex instrument can be used to characterize the shape of the signal function . the pump - probe technique based on a correlation principle",
    "we are describe in section 7 is to use two spatially separated samples and record correlation of the count fluctuations for each value of the delay @xmath54 between two pump laser pulses",
    ". averaged ( shot to shot ) count product contains information about the shape of the signal function .",
    "another advantage of the correlator measurement is the possibility to remove the monochromator between spatial filter and sample and thus to increase the count degeneracy parameter .",
    "the present section considers the statistical properties of the intensity fluctuations in synchrotron light . in order to give the subject a semblance of continuity , it will be desirable to introduce considerable matter which will be found in any of standard works on statistical optics .",
    "much of the credit for stimulating modern development in statistical analysis of synchrotron radiation is due to professor s goodman book @xcite , which laid the groundwork for the principles of pump - probe techniques based on statistical properties of synchrotron light .",
    "quite basic similarities between the methods described here and the methods introduced into x - ray free electron laser physics by authors in @xcite should be recognized .",
    "we here consider the classical theory of the fluctuation experiment , reserving the quantum discussion for section 4 , where the theory of intensity fluctuations is reconsidered in terms of the quantized radiation field .      in this subsection",
    "we study the statistical properties of the shot noise in the electron beam .",
    "it should be noted that the process under study is nonstationary with finite pulse duration , so in what follows the averaging symbol @xmath55 means the ensemble average over bunches .",
    "let us consider the microscopic picture of the electron beam current at the entrance of the undulator .",
    "the electron beam current is made up of moving electrons randomly arriving at the entrance to the undulator :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the delta function , @xmath58 is the charge of the electron , @xmath59 is the number of electrons in a bunch , and @xmath60 is the random arrival time of the electron at the undulator entrance .",
    "the electron bunch profile is described by the profile function @xmath61 .",
    "the beam current averaged over an ensemble of bunches can be written in the form :    @xmath62    for instance for an electron beam with gaussian distribution of the current along the beam , the profile function is :    @xmath63    the probability of arrival of an electron during the time interval @xmath64 is equal to @xmath65 .",
    "the electron beam current , @xmath66 , and its fourier transform , @xmath67 , are connected by    @xmath68    @xmath69    it follows from these expressions that the fourier transform of the input current , @xmath67 , is the sum of a large number of complex phasors with random phases @xmath70 . when the electron pulse duration , @xmath71 , is long , @xmath72 , the phases @xmath73 can be regarded as uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath74 .",
    "the formal summation of the phasors is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pps7 ] .",
    "the calculation is an example of the `` random walk '' problem , well known in the theory of stochastic process . in this case",
    "we can use the central limit theorem and conclude that the real part and the imaginary part of @xmath67 are distributed in accordance with the gaussian law @xcite .",
    "the probability density distribution of @xmath75 is given by the negative exponential distribution :    @xmath76      let us calculate the first - order correlation of the complex fourier harmonics @xmath67 and @xmath77 :    @xmath78    expanding this relation , we can write :    @xmath79\\rangle + e^{2}\\sum _ { k\\ne n}\\langle\\exp({\\mathop{\\mathrm{i}}}\\omega t_{k})\\rangle    \\langle\\exp(-{\\mathop{\\mathrm{i}}}\\omega^{\\prime } t_{n})\\rangle \\ .\\ ] ]    expression @xmath80 is equal to the fourier transformation of the bunch profile function @xmath61 :    @xmath81    thus we can write :    @xmath82    when    @xmath83    we can write the following expression for the first - order spectral correlation :    @xmath84    the fourier transform of the gaussian profile function has the form :    @xmath85    for the specific cases of a gaussian profile of the electron bunch , the first - order correlation of the complex fourier harmonics , @xmath67 and @xmath77 , has the form :    @xmath86 \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : s4}\\ ] ]    let us discuss the region of validity of the approximation ( [ eq : s2 ] ) .",
    "the physical meaning of ( [ eq : s2 ] ) is that the frequency @xmath17 has to be large enough , @xmath87 . to be specific , we consider a numerical example for a gaussian bunch profile .",
    "the value of @xmath88 is equal to @xmath89 when @xmath90 .",
    "so condition ( [ eq : s2 ] ) is always fulfilled in practice .",
    "let us calculate the second order correlation of the complex fourier harmonics @xmath67 and @xmath77 :    @xmath91\\rangle \\ .\\ ] ]    the @xmath92 terms in this sum can be set in 15 classes @xcite .",
    "when condition ( [ eq : s2 ] ) is fulfilled , only two of them are of importance , corresponding to @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus we can write :    @xmath95    substituting ( [ eq : s4 ] ) into ( [ eq : s5 ] ) we obtain :    @xmath96      why is it that the noise in electron beam is a gaussian random process ? why is this the right rule , what is the fundamental reason for it , and how is it connected to anything else ?",
    "the explanation is deep down in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is generally accepted that quantum mechanics provides the best current picture of physical phenomena , and the most complete description of the radiation field must be sought in quantum - mechanical terms . the quantum theory of radiation predicts the existence of zero - point electromagnetic field . the first step is to show that a field mode is equivalent to harmonic oscillator . to describe a field mode quantum mechanically ,",
    "we simply describe the equivalent harmonic oscillator quantum mechanically .",
    "the vacuum state @xmath97 has no photons , but predicts that it nevertheless has an energy @xmath98 . from the probability distribution for a ground - state harmonic oscillator",
    ", we easily obtain the probability distribution for the electric field in vacuum state @xmath97 . what is the physical significance of these vacuum - state expectation values ?",
    "one thing they indicate is that the electromagnetic vacuum is a stationary state of the field with statistical fluctuations of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "as far as measurements are concerned , however , it is often argued that the entire universe is evidently bathed in zero - point electromagnetic field , which is distributed according to a gaussian probability distribution @xcite .",
    "relativistic electron beam passing through bending magnets emits synchrotron radiation , a process that leads to damping . in standard classical electrodynamics",
    "there is only the radiation reaction field to act on a single particle in the vacuum .",
    "all six degrees of freedom for electron motion in storage ring are damped and the actual value of electron beam emittance would be equal to zero .",
    "we deduce the synchrotron radiation formula using a classical treatment .",
    "so , the reasonable question arises of whether such a classical model describes correctly the synchrotron radiation in the storage ring .",
    "simple physical considerations show that such a description is valid for any practical situation .",
    "the classical electrodynamics approach can be used when the energy of the radiated photon @xmath99 is much less than the energy of the electron . as a rule , @xmath100 and quantum effects are negligible .",
    "classically we generally assume implicitly that the homogeneous solution of the maxwell equations is that in which the electric and magnetic fields vanish identically .",
    "that is , we assume that there are no fields in the absence of any sources . in the absence of sources the vacuum field is simply zero , with no energy or fluctuations whatsoever .",
    "this is not to say that we can not have source - free fields in classical electrodynamics .",
    "rather , the absence of zero - point fields in standard classical theory lies in the assumption that there are no fields in the absence of any sources .",
    "we can go beyond standard classical theory and postulate the existence of zero - point electric and magnetic fields in the absence of any sources .",
    "the difference between classical and quantum electrodynamics , together with the evident importance of the fluctuating vacuum field in quantum electrodynamics , suggests the adoption of a different boundary conditions in classical electrodynamics : instead of assuming that the classical field vanishes in the absence of sources , we can assume that there is a fluctuating classical field with zero energy @xmath98 per mode . as long as this field satisfies the maxwell s equations there is no a priori inconsistency in this assumption .",
    "the appearance of @xmath101 in this modification of classical electrodynamics implies no deviation from conventional classical ideas , for @xmath101 is regarded as nothing more than a number chosen to obtain consistency of the predictions of the theory with experiment .",
    "the resulting theory is able to account quantum effects within a fully classical framework @xcite .",
    "we note that electron storage rings have provided strong evidence for the reality of zero - point energy . in the experiments with stored electrons",
    "the zero - point energy sets a lower limit to freezing of the electron motion .",
    "if there were no noise associated with the vacuum fields , the actual value of electron beam emittance would be equal to zero . in storage rings damping will counteract quantum excitation leading to an equilibrium .",
    "if one looks over the derivation of the quantum diffusion of the electrons in the storage ring , it becomes clear that the argument can be couched in the language of stochastic electrodynamics rather than quantum electrodynamics .",
    "that is , all that is really required in that derivation is zero - point energy @xmath98 per mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "whether this zero - point energy is of quantum or classical origin is irrelevant for the purpose of deriving the diffusion coefficient - stochastic electrodynamics accounts perfectly well for the quantum diffusion of electrons in storage ring . in this case both the field and the particles are treated classically and we have no practical need in accelerator physics for quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the diffusion terms will introduce a statistical mixing of the phases and after some damping times any initial azimuthal variation of the phase space density will be washed out .",
    "electrons in a storage ring are evidently bathed in zero - point electromagnetic field , which is distributed according to a gaussian probability distribution .",
    "this is the explanation of the relation between vacuum fluctuations and shot noise in the electron beam .      above we described the properties of the input shot noise signal in the frequency domain .",
    "the next step is the derivation of the spectral function connecting the fourier amplitudes of the output field and the fourier amplitudes of the input noise signal . in the first analysis of the problem",
    ", we adopt some rather simplifying assumptions that are only occasionally met in practice . following this simplified analysis ,",
    "however , we show how the validity of the results can be extended to a far wider range of conditions than might have been thought at the start .",
    "we will investigate the synchrotron radiation in the framework of the one - dimensional model .",
    "for simplicity we consider linear polarization of synchrotron radiation , and use a scalar representation of the radiation field .",
    "nevertheless , all the results are valid for any polarization .",
    "the one - dimensional model describes the radiation of the plane electromagnetic wave    @xmath102 + { \\mathrm{c.c . } } \\ , \\ ] ]    by the electron beam in the planar undulator .",
    "the electric field of the electromagnetic wave in the time domain , @xmath103 , and its fourier transform , @xmath104 , are connected by    @xmath105    when @xmath106 the fourier harmonic is defined by the relation @xmath107 .",
    "the fourier harmonic of the transversely coherent electromagnetic field at the spatial filter exit and the fourier harmonic of the current at the undulator entrance are connected by the relation :    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the spectral function of the undulator . for an undulator of @xmath110 periods",
    "each electron oscillates through @xmath110 cycles of its motion and thus radiates a wavetrain consisting of @xmath110 cycles of the electric field .",
    "the fourier transform of this waveform which gives the spectral content of the fields , is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the frequency shift away from the central maximum at @xmath114 .",
    "thus we can write ( see section 4 ) :    @xmath115    it is relevant to make some remarks on the region of applicability of the one - dimensional theory .",
    "one - dimensional model assumes the input shot noise and output radiation to have full transverse coherence .",
    "this assumption allow us to assume that the input shot noise signal is defined by the value of beam current ( [ eq : e1 ] ) .",
    "in reality the fluctuations of the electron beam current density are uncorrelated in the transverse dimension . using the notion of the beam radiation modes",
    ", we can say that many transverse radiation modes are radiated when the electron beam enters the undulator .",
    "the one - dimensional model can be used for the calculations of statistical properties of transversely coherent synchrotron radiation . in practice",

    "the particle beam parameters are    @xmath251    where @xmath252 is the betatron function in the undulator , @xmath253 is the horizontal and vertical electron beam emittance , respectively . to modify the expression for spectral brightness for the case of undulator radiation , we can use the previously calculated photon flux in the central radiation cone , @xmath254 , which was defined as having a relative spectral bandwidth ( bw ) of @xmath255 ( under condition ( [ con ] ) ) and radiation cone of half angle @xmath233 . taking into account the contribution of diffraction effects , we may wright the following expressions for the size and angular divergence of the photon beam :    @xmath256    where @xmath257 is the diffraction limited radiation beam size , @xmath258 is the diffraction limited radiation beam divergence , and @xmath259 is the undulator length @xcite .",
    "it is frequently used in the synchrotron radiation community to express the spectral brightness in terms of relative spectral bandwidth of @xmath260 . the expression for @xmath261 in terms of photon flux within the central cone is @xcite :    @xmath262      our previous discussion assumed that the synchrotron light striking the photosurface was completely coherent in a spatial sense . in such a case",
    "the number of degrees of freedom @xmath154 is determined strictly by temporal effects .",
    "when the wave is not spatially coherent , its spatial structure can affect the number of degrees of freedom ; at any given time , different parts of the photosensitive surface may experience different levels of incident intensity .",
    "one of the way to overcome this problem is based on the idea to use a spatial filter .",
    "this possibility to create spatially coherent radiation is important for many experiments specifically for our scheme for time - resolved experiments and we will discuss in more detail the conditions for the synchrotron light source to emit such radiation .    as an example of pinhole spatial filtering , fig .",
    "[ fig : pps3 ] illustrates how the technique is used to obtain spatially coherent radiation from a periodic undulator @xcite .",
    "the limiting condition of spatially coherent radiation is a space - angle product @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is a gaussian @xmath250 diameter and @xmath219 is the gaussian half angle @xcite . in general the phase space volume of photons in the central radiation cone is larger than the limiting condition required for spatial coherence .",
    "thus , for experiments that require spatial coherence , a pinhole and angular acceptance aperture are to be introduced .",
    "this pinhole spatial filter is used to narrow , or filter , the phase space of transmitted radiation .",
    "filtering to @xmath265 requires the use of both a small pinhole ( @xmath264 ) , and some limitation on @xmath219 , such that the product is equal to @xmath266 .",
    "the radiation is transversely coherent when    @xmath267    under these conditions , one has @xmath268 and @xmath269 and the spectral - angular dependence of the radiation emitted by an electron beam can be approximated by the spectral - angular dependence of the radiation emitted by a single electron .",
    "this limit corresponds to the maximum spectral brightness    @xmath270    when the electron beam emittance is large ,    @xmath271    the radiation is partially coherent .",
    "one can show that the influence of the electron beam divergence on the properties of the undulator radiation can be neglected when the beta - function is large enough . in the region of parameters",
    "when    @xmath272    a downstream diaphragm of aperture @xmath273 is used for selection of the transversely coherent fraction of undulator radiation . finally , in this limit , the flux of transversely coherent photons into the bandwidth @xmath274 can be estimated simply as    @xmath275    these remarks may be useful in estimating the conditions under which a spatially coherent plane wavefront may be obtained from a noncoherent source .",
    "the spatial coherence in a light beam generally has to do with the coherence between two points in the field illuminated by light source .",
    "the meaning of spatial coherence can best be understood with the help of young s two - pinhole experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pps10 ] ) . in its elementary sense",
    ", the degree of coherence between the two points simply describes the contrast of the interference fringes that are obtained when the two points are taken as secondary sources .",

    "that is to say , no interference fringes can be obtained by placing two pinholes in the plane of the source .",
    "it was shown , however , that if the two slits are placed far enough away from the noncoherent source , interference fringes of good contrast can be obtained ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pps11 ] ) .",
    "it is sometimes said that the spatial coherence in light beams increases with distance `` by mere propagation '' .",
    "it would be nice to find an explanation which is elementary in the sense that we can see what is happening physically .",
    "suppose that a quasimonochromatic wave is incident on an aperture in an opaque screen , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pps12 ] . in general",
    ", this wave may be partially coherent .",
    "the detailed structure of an optical wave undergoes changes at the wave propagates through space . in a similar fashion",
    ", the detailed structure of the spatial coherence undergoes changes , and in this sense the transverse coherence function is said to propagate . knowing the spatial coherence on the aperture , we wish to find the spatial coherence on the observing screen at distance @xmath236 beyond the aperture .",

    "@xmath278 may be estimated as the typical linear dimension of speckles .",
    "first we wish to calculate the ( instantaneous ) intensity distribution observed across a parallel plane at distance @xmath236 beyond the aperture .",
    "the observed intensity distribution can be found from a two - dimensional fourier transform of the field .",
    "the radiation field across the aperture may be presented as a superposition of plane waves , all with the same wavenumber @xmath280 .",
    "the value of @xmath281 gives the sine of the angle between the @xmath236 axis and the direction of propagation of the plane wave . in the paraxial approximation @xmath282 .",
    "if the radiation beyond the aperture is partially coherent , a spiky angular spectrum is expected .",
    "the nature of the spikes in the angular spectrum is easily described in fourier - transform notations .",
    "we can expect that the typical width of the angular spectrum envelope should be of the order of @xmath283 .",
    "also an angular spectrum of the source having transverse size @xmath264 should contain spikes with a typical width of about @xmath284 , a consequence of the reciprocal width relations of fourier transform pairs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pps14 ] ) .",
    "it is the source linear dimension @xmath264 that determines the coherent area of the observed wave @xmath285 , but in addition the coherence linear dimension @xmath278 of the source influences the distribution of average intensity over the observing screen with typical width @xmath286 . thus , if the screen is placed far enough away from the noncoherent source , @xmath287 , a coherence area of large linear dimension can be obtained .      in order to use the radiation from the source it first has to be filtered and monochromatized .",
    "finally , to be complete , we should remark that in the experimental arrangement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pps5 ] there is still one other effect which gives spatial filtering .",
    "a monochromator is just a spatial filter working in dispersive direction only .",
    "we would like to show next how it is that a monochromator can act like a spatial filter .",
    "figure  [ fig : pps4 ] shows the grating geometry under consideration .",
    "the finite size of the entrance and exit slits in the dispersive direction sets a limit to the achievable resolution .",
    "the slit - width - limited resolution can be obtained directly from the grating equation . in particular , the entrance slit - width - limited resolution is given by @xcite :    @xmath288    where @xmath289 is the angle of incidence , @xmath290 is the number of lines on the grating , @xmath291 is the width of grating , @xmath292 is the line density , @xmath293 is the order of the diffraction pattern , @xmath264 is the width of entrance slit , @xmath236 is the entrance slit - grating distance .",
    "we see that the resolution is equal to    @xmath294    the coefficient @xmath295 is just the minimal uncertainty in the wavelength that can be measured with the given grating .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality between @xmath296 and @xmath297 is @xmath298 $ ] .",
    "what does all this mean ?",
    "this is an example in which transverse coherence plays an important role .",
    "the ability to spectrally filter radiation by a monochromator requires well - defined phase and amplitude variations of the fields across the grating .",
    "so in order that we shall have a sharp line in our spectrum corresponding to a definite wavelength with an uncertainty given by @xmath295 , we have to have a wave transverse coherence area of at least the size @xmath299 .",
    "if the transverse coherence area is too small we are not using the entire grating .",
    "suppose we have an entrance slit with aperture @xmath264 and send a beam of radiation at the grating with an aperture @xmath299 .",
    "the radiation reaching the grating is transversely coherent when the following condition for the space - angle product is fulfilled :    @xmath300    we expect that only for pure transverse coherence , the grating will work right and the resolution @xmath296 and @xmath297 will be nearly equal .",
    "importantly , in our scheme that incorporates an external pinhole spatial filter ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pps5 ] ) , the monochromator does not require an entrance slit .",
    "physically the wave degeneracy parameter describes the average number of photons which can interfere , or , according to quantum theory , the number of photons in one quantum state ( one `` mode '' ) .",
    "we shall deal with two different approaches to the calculation of the wave degeneracy parameter .",
    "first we consider what can reasonably called `` fluctuation experiments in the frequency domain '' ( see subsection 3.6 ) .",
    "for the frequency domain we use the notion of the wave degeneracy parameter @xmath12 which is equal to the average number of transversely coherent photons radiated by the electron bunch inside the spectral interval of coherence @xmath148 . taking into account that the `` emittance '' of the diffraction limited photon beam is equal to    @xmath301",
    "we calculate the average number of spatially coherent photons radiated within one pulse into the spectral interval of @xmath302 :    @xmath303    where @xmath304 is the instantaneous spectral brightness of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the value of @xmath305 is connected with the interval of the spectral coherence by the relation : @xmath306 . using ( [ eq : e7 ] ) , ( [ eq : e9 ] ) and parseval s theorem we obtain :    @xmath307    using the fact that the instantaneous spectral brightness @xmath304 and the instantaneous value of the beam current @xmath308 are related by @xmath309 , we can equivalently write @xmath310 .",
    "it is convenient to refer to the peak value of spectral brightness    @xmath311    by convention , we represent the time integral of the instantaneous spectral brightness in the form    @xmath312    note that the dependence of the factor    @xmath313    on the exact shape of the bunch is rather weak .",
    "the results are @xmath314 for the rectangular pulse - shape and @xmath315 for the gaussian pulse - shape .",
    "thus @xmath316 is a reasonable approximation .",
    "finally , the degeneracy parameter can be estimated simply as :    @xmath317    what about the other kinds of fluctuation experiments , for example , integrated intensity fluctuations ?",
    "for the time domain we use the notion of the wave degeneracy parameter @xmath12 which is equal to the average number of transversely coherent photons radiated by the electron bunch during the coherence time @xmath1 :    @xmath318    finally , the product @xmath319 is given by the expression    @xmath320    the dependence of the factor @xmath321 on the exact shape of the spectral distribution is rather weak .",
    "let us consider the specific case of a gaussian line profile .",
    "the explicit expression for the coherence time is @xmath322 .",
    "the fwhm bandwidth would be @xmath323 giving , for @xmath324 .",
    "thus @xmath325 is a reasonable approximation and the wave degeneracy parameter @xmath12 is given by the expression ( [ eq : d1 ] ) .",
    "the frequency domain calculations and time domain calculations give similar results .",
    "let us present a specific numerical example for the case of a third - generation synchrotron light source .",
    "the peak spectral brightness at a wavelength of 10 nm is equal to    @xmath326    substituting this number into ( [ eq : d1 ] ) we obtain that the wave degeneracy parameter is about @xmath327 .",
    "hence in the soft x - ray region of the spectrum we expect classically induced fluctuations of photocounts to have a far stronger effect than pure quantum shot noise fluctuations . on the other hand , in the hard x - ray region of the spectrum ( @xmath328 nm ) , a source brightness in excess of    @xmath329    is required to produce a wave degeneracy parameter greater than unity . since third - generation sources have a peak brightness of only this value , we can conclude that in this region of the spectrum , the vast majority of third - generation synchrotron light sources encountered produce radiation with wave degeneracy parameters comparable with unity , and hence noise produced by the quantized nature of the radiation is comparable with the noise produced by classical fluctuations of the intensity .",
    "a few additional comments are needed in closing this section .",
    "we have concentrated our attention on the wave degeneracy parameter , which is a property of the synchrotron radiation falling on the photodetector . that photodetector invariably has a quantum efficiency that is less than unity .",
    "in addition , the efficiency of the monochromator is less than unity , too .",
    "hence the count degeneracy parameter will be even smaller than the wave degeneracy parameter .",
    "when the integration time is large , @xmath330 , the parameter @xmath32 is given by :    @xmath331    where @xmath42 is the monochromator throughput . in the opposite case , at @xmath332 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is about    @xmath333    in addition , it is possible that the sample or collecting optics may intercept only a fraction of one spatial mode from the source . in such a case",
    "the count degeneracy parameter may again be smaller than the wave degeneracy parameter , as a result of the incomplete capture of a spatial mode .",
    "although the minimum value of @xmath154 is unity , the reduction of the energy striking the detector surface must be taken into account .",
    "in such a case , the count degeneracy parameter must be reduced from the normal value by a factor of the ratio of the effective measurement area to the coherence area of the incident light .",
    "the principle of operation of the proposed pump - probe scheme is based essentially on the classical intensity fluctuations of synchrotron radiation .",
    "it is shown above that stochastic fluctuations of the classical intensity can influence the statistical properties of the photoevents that are observed .",
    "note in particular that the variance @xmath334 of @xmath19 consists of two distinct terms , each of which has a physical interpretation :    @xmath335    the first term is simply the variance of the counts that would be observed if the classical intensity were constant and the photocounts were purely poisson .",
    "we refer to this contribution to the count fluctuations as `` quantum noise '' .",
    "the second term , @xmath156 , is clearly zero if there are no fluctuations of the classical intensity .",
    "for instance , in the case of laser light , this component would be identically zero , and the count variance would be simply that arising from poisson - distributed counts . when synchrotron light is incident on the sample surface , the classical fluctuations are nonzero , and the variance of the photocounts is larger than that expected for a poisson distribution by an amount that is proportional to the variance of the integrated intensity .",
    "this extra component of variance of the counts is often referred to as `` excess noise , '' meaning that it is above and beyond that expected for pure poisson fluctuations @xcite .",
    "our initial goal was to find expressions for the classical variance @xmath156 of the integrated intensity .",
    "also of major interest is the signal - to - noise ratio , associated with the variance , which provides us with an indication of the magnitude of the fluctuations of classical variance relative to the expectation value .",
    "the general approach to calculating the output signal - to - noise ratio of the proposed device will be as follows . following subtraction of the @xmath212 associated with the quantum noise ( see ( [ eq : sn1a ] ) ) ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio takes the form .",
    "an assumption that this quantity is known much more accurately than @xmath336 is justified in our case , actually several or many different coherence times must be explored , and @xmath212 is thus observed over many more shots than is @xmath336 for any one coherence time . ]",
    "@xmath337    where @xmath156 is calculated using ( [ eq : e28 ] ) , @xmath36 is the number of independent measurements averaged in the accumulator ( total number of shots ) .",
    "the only requirement for the accuracy of this procedure is that the count fluctuations be uncorrelated from shot to shot , a property that does hold in our case",
    ".    a fully general study of the signal - to - noise ratio would be nontrivial .",
    "the difficulty arises in simultaneously including the effects on that noise of both the classically induced fluctuations and poisson fluctuations of the counts .",
    "the full analysis , including both of these effects , is a difficult analytical problem .",
    "the calculation can be performed without great difficulty in two limiting cases , namely , the cases of degeneracy parameter very large and very small compared with 1 . when @xmath34 , there are many photoevents present in each coherence interval of the wave .",
    "the result is a `` bunching '' of the photoevents by the classical intensity fluctuations , and an increase of the variance of the counts to the point where the classically induced fluctuations are far stronger than the quantum noise variations .",
    "when the degeneracy parameter is much larger than 1 , the expression ( [ eq : sn1b ] ) can be replaced by    @xmath338    our consideration is restricted to the two simplest cases from the analytical point of view , namely , the cases of integration time @xmath14 very short and very long compared with the coherence time . for short integration time , the value of the incident intensity @xmath21 is approximately constant over the entire counting interval . as a consequence , the integrated intensity @xmath133 is distributed in accordance with the negative exponential distribution ( [ eq : e2a ] ) .",
    "it follows that the @xmath339 can be expressed in terms of the mean as    @xmath340    using the above expression , we find that the signal - to - noise ratio is given by the expression :    @xmath341    this calculation shows that the fluctuations of the @xmath342 is about @xmath343 times larger than the fluctuations of the mean value @xmath344 .    at the opposite extreme , with an integration time",
    "much longer than the coherence time , the integrated intensity , @xmath133 , is distributed in accordance with the gaussian distribution .",
    "it follows that    @xmath345    we know that for the case when @xmath33 the fluctuations of photocounts are strongly dominated by pure quantum noise .",
    "thus the probability of obtaining @xmath19 counts is , to a good approximation , given by the poisson distribution .",
    "we can not neglect the classically induced fluctuations of the counts when we calculate the signal component of the output , but we can neglect them when we calculate the noise , simply because their contribution to the noise is so small . for the final approximation we note that if the integration time @xmath14 is very short compared with the coherence time , the expression for the photocounts degeneracy parameter is equal to the average number of detected photoelectrons per pulse @xmath346 . hence , when @xmath33 and @xmath332 the following approximation is valid : @xmath347 . as a reminder , recall that the factorial moments of the poisson distribution are given by    @xmath348    it follows that    @xmath349    substituting this result into ( [ eq : sn1b ] ) we find    @xmath350    note that this expression is independent of the integration time @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the signal - to - noise ratio is not improved by using a longer `` characteristic time '' of sample dynamics .",
    "a more complex instrument can be used to characterize the shape of the signal function .",
    "the technique we are to describe here is to use two spatially separated samples and record correlation of the count fluctuations for each value of the delay @xmath54 between two pump laser pulses .",
    "the new configuration is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pps17 ] . in this case",
    "the transversely coherent probe x - ray beam is splitting and incidents on two spatially separated samples .",
    "the detected photoevents are than correlated , and the sample dynamics is determined from that correlation .",
    "each detector is connected with a separate electronic counter . the version of apparatus for measurement of average count product depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pps16 ] . during one radiation pulse ,",
    "each of two detectors registers @xmath351 and @xmath352 number of photocounts , respectively .",
    "after each shot , an electronic scheme multiplies these numbers and passes this product to an averaging accumulator , where it is added to the previously stored sum of count products . finally , the total sum is divided by the number of shots .",
    "this result , averaged ( shot to shot ) count product @xmath353 , contains information about the shape of the signal function .",
    "another advantage of the correlator measurement is the possibility to remove the monochromator between spatial filter and sample and thus to increase the count degeneracy parameter .",
    "now our goal is to find the relationship between the expected value of the average count product and the sample dynamics .",
    "in addition , we wish to find the variance of this quantity , so that the signal - to - noise ratio associated with the measurement can be determined and compared with the similar quantities found in the previous section .      by the `` count fluctuations '' we mean explicitly the difference between the actual numbers of counts obtained in one shot at detector 1 and 2 and the expected values of these two number counts .",
    "thus    @xmath354    the averaging accumulator at the output of the system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pps16 ] in effect produces an estimate of the expected value of the product of the two count fluctuations .",
    "thus we are interested in statistical properties of the quantity @xmath355 , and particular its mean and variance .",
    "let us calculate the expected average value of @xmath356 :    @xmath357    where @xmath358 is the joint probability distribution of @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "it follows from the basic properties of the conditional probabilities that    @xmath359    where @xmath360 represents the joint probability distribution of integrated intensities @xmath361 and @xmath362 .",
    "the values @xmath363 can be interpreted as the portion of x - ray pulse energy converted to a detectable form ",
    "photoelectrons for example ( see section 2.7 ) . since @xmath351 and @xmath352 are independent when conditioned by the integrated intensities @xmath361 and @xmath362 , respectively , we can write @xcite :    @xmath364    using mandel s formula ( [ eq : m ] ) we can write :    @xmath365    using these facts , the following expression for the average of the count product can now be written    @xmath366    at this point we interchange the orders of summation and integration in ( [ eq : k1a ] ) . using the relationship",
    "@xmath367    we can express the average of the count product in terms of the average of the classical integrated intensities at the two detectors @xcite ,    @xmath368    this result shows that much can be learnt about the classically induced fluctuations by studing the photocount correlation .",
    "so , the next problem is the description of the correlation of the classical integrated intensities    @xmath369    where @xmath370 is the sample gating function ( signal function ) .",
    "suppose that the pump pulse interacts with the first and second sample at @xmath22 and @xmath371 , respectively .",
    "in this case the gating functions are : @xmath372 .",
    "when the average intensities incident on the two samples are constant and equal , @xmath373    the expression for the correlation of count fluctuations reduces to the useful form is a good assumption . ]",

    "we obtain    @xmath379    one can also write ( [ eq : k2 ] ) as    @xmath380    where @xmath156 is the variance of the integrated intensity distribution ( for example see expression ( [ eq : e28 ] ) ) .",
    "in the limit of a large photocount degeneracy parameter , @xmath34 , we have @xmath381 .    the expression    @xmath382    is called an autocorrelation .",
    "one immediately recognizes the physical meaning of the autocorrelation functions .",
    "the fourier transform of the autocorrelation is @xmath383 , related to the fourier transform of the signal by : @xmath384 . an autocorrelation is always a symmetric function .",
    "the fourier transform of the autocorrelation is a real function , consistent with a symmetric function in the time domain .",
    "the question then naturally arises as to exactly what information about @xmath370 can be derived from the measurement of cross - correlation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pps19 ] ) .",
    "one can see that the proposed correlation technique provides the possibility to measure the modulus of the fourier transform of the signal function , while information about its phase is missing . to provide reconstruction of the signal function from the autocorrelation function a special iterative technique should be used .",
    "clearly , without loss of generality , we can assume that the signal function describing the sample dynamics is zero for @xmath385 and nonzero for @xmath386 .",
    "additionally we know that at @xmath22 the signal function is maximum .",
    "these relationships help us with the task at hand , namely determining the phase of @xmath387 from the knowledge of its modulus in the majority of cases involving functions @xmath370 of considerable complexity .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible to find cases in which ambiguities exist .      the signal - to - noise ratio for the proposed device ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pps16 ] ) can be written in the form :    @xmath388    where @xmath36 is the number of independent measurements averaged in the accumulator .",
    "let us consider the case when the degeneracy parameter is much larger than unity , @xmath34 .",
    "the fluctuations of the photocounts are defined mainly by the classical noise in this case and ( [ eq : k3 ] ) can be reduced to    @xmath389    remembering that the integrated intensity is distributed in accordance with the gaussian distribution one can derive that    @xmath390    where @xmath391 denote    @xmath392    combining the above expressions , we find that the signal - to - noise ratio is given by the expression :    @xmath393    let us analyse the signal - to - noise ratio taking into account the quantum effects . when calculating the signal component ( numerator of ( [ eq : k3 ] ) ) , we can take into account classically induced fluctuations of the counts only .",

    "the electron beam delay line needed for time resolved experiments has to satisfy two requirements .",
    "first , the electron beam extra path length , @xmath415 , must be long enough to reach a delay time of about 100 femtoseconds .",
    "a first question that arises is : why do we want to use 100 fs delay time ? here",
    "we direct the attention of the reader to the fact that we assume to use 5 - 10 fs visible pump pulses .",
    "on the other hand we assume that the pump pulse can be approximated by a delta function .",
    "one can never hope to achieve a visible laser pulse duration ten times shorter than the present .",
    "this limitation prevents the application of this technique to the timescale shorter than 100 fs .",
    "second , the effect of suppressing the beam density modulation due to the presence of the energy spread in the electron beam should be avoided in order to preserve the correlation of the radiation field within the delay time .",

    "parameters in our case are : @xmath417 , @xmath418 .",
    "the delay time and energy spread in the electron beam dictates the choice of synchrotron radiation wavelengths .",
    "these results demonstrate that this scheme is adequate for the vuv spectral range , but can not be used to produce x - ray probe beams .",
    "the situation is quite different for the first scheme of autocorrelator ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pps18 ] ) . since in this case",
    "the probe beams are produced by x - ray splitter and delay line , the energy spread limitation does not exist at all .",
    "a general objective in the development of synchrotron radiation sources is to produce radiation that is brighter than that from existing sources , or to produce radiation that comes in shorter pulses .",
    "current machines produce bunch lengths in the 100-ps regime .",
    "many experiments exploit this time dependence .",
    "light - triggered time - resolved studies with 100 ps resolution are now frequently performed at synchrotron light sources .",
    "however , 100 picoseconds is longer than the time associated with many interesting physical phenomena .",
    "the storage ring technology itself approaches its limits of performance with respect to minimal pulse duration .",
    "no practical means have been found to allow bunches of less than a ten picoseconds duration to be stored . a proposed in this paper schemes for fast time - resolved experiments could offer the possibility to overcome this limitation .",
    "it was shown that the femtosecond timescale associated with intensity fluctuations in synchrotron light pulses make them well suited for time - resolved studies .",
    "the new concept eliminates the need for ultrashort x - ray pulses .",
    "this development in synchrotron based pump - probe experiments allows us to investigate phenomena in the time range down to 100 fs .",
    "it is the author s hope that the general principles of pump - probe techniques based on statistical properties of synchrotron light , presented in this paper , may help in stimulating further inquiry and result in success in many exciting applications , some of which can now only be barely envisioned .",
