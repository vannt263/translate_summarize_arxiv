    "<S> in this paper , we construct thin - shell wormholes by applying the cut and paste procedure to a regular charged black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics field . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss different physical aspects of wormholes such as , the possible equation of state to matter shell , attractive or repulsive nature of wormhole and total amount of exotic matter required . </S>",
    "<S> the thin - shell equation of motion with and without cosmological constant is also investigated under linearized perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explore the stability regions interpreted by the parameter @xmath0 ( speed of sound ) and conclude that there are realistic stability regions for some fixed values of parameters .    </S>",
