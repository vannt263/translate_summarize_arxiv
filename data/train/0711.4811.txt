    "our sun is known to act as a gravitational lens .",
    "the angular shift of the apparent position of a star located behind the sun was first observed during the solar eclipse of 1919 @xcite , in conformity with the predictions of general relativity @xcite .",
    "many years later , einstein ( 1936 ) discussed the lens like action of the sun s gravitational field more generally .",
    "the influence of that discussion has caused the ring seen by the observer during perfect alignment of the source , lens and the observer to be called the einstein ring around a point lens .",
    "for an opaque lens , the result of exterior focusing of the parallel light rays incident with an impact parameter @xmath1 on the lens plane is a deflection @xmath2 .",
    "the deflection @xmath2 is inversely proportional to the impact parameter @xmath1 according to the formula first derived by einstein ( 1911 ) @xmath3 where @xmath1 is the impact parameter of the passing light ray , @xmath4 is the deflecting mass , @xmath5 is the gravitational constant and @xmath6 is the speed of light in vacuum . assuming the deflection angle is small , the minimum focal length for the opaque sun is approximated by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the total mass and radius of the sun , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath10 is based on statistical errors on @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "slight offsets of the lens or source from the optic axis will break the einstein ring into two bright images as seen by the observer .",
    "therefore the opaque sun produces multiple images only beyond @xmath10 .",
    "the possibility of using the _ transparent _ sun as a gravitational lens was first discussed by cyranski and lubkin ( 1974 ) and more recently by nemiroff and ftaclas ( 1997 ) .",
    "demkov and puchkov ( 2000 ) computed a minimum focal length of the transparent sun to be about 24 au .",
    "starting with the standard solar model as it was known in 1989 @xcite , they computed the gravitational lens deflection angle as a function of impact parameter and then approximated this with a taylor s series near the sun s center .    throughout the present analysis , the more recent 2005 standard solar model ( ssm ) data",
    "is used @xcite . a more complete model of the gravitational lens characteristics of the transparent sun",
    "is computed , including a more accurate minimum focal length ( 23.5 @xmath13 0.1 au ) , regions of multiple images , and the locations of caustics and critical curves .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : @xmath14 2 outlines two alternative approaches to obtain the minimal focal length of the transparent sun .",
    "the strength of a composite lens capable of producing multiple images is given a through treatment in @xmath15 3 .",
    "the critical curves , caustics , magnification and multiple image zones are computed in @xmath15 4 , and conclusions summarized in @xmath15 5 .",
    "it is well known that only a point lens can generate two images in the weak deflection limit ( schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) . however",
    ", a composite lens can produce multiple images .",
    "the location of images in the lens plane depends on the enclosed projected mass within the impact radius .",
    "burke s odd number theorem @xcite states that a composite lens can produce only odd number of images of the source , and the images always appear ( disappear ) in pairs as the source moves inside ( outside ) of a caustic .    in the standard geometrical optics approximation",
    ", light rays start out straight from a source and then change directions discretely at the deflector plane , subsequently reaching the observer . to utilize geometric optics for a composite lens ,",
    "one must project the three - dimensional mass of the deflector onto a plane perpendicular to the optical axis connecting the source to the observer . a plane wave approximation is assumed by considering source radiation that has a wavelength @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , is the schwarzschild radius of the deflecting lens mass .",
    "it is also assumed that the sources are point like and there is no contribution due to internally converging ricci focusing by the mass within a pencil of rays . in other words the light bundle is assumed to be infinitesimally thin and the deflection is purely due to weyl focusing by the projected mass lying within the impact radius @xcite .",
    "the mass outside of the impact radius does not contribute to the deflection , following newton s and birkhoff s theorem .",
    "is at a distance @xmath18 from the observer @xmath19 and a distance @xmath20 from the source @xmath21 . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the angles subtended by the unlensed source and its image visible to the observer . ]    the geometry of fig .",
    "[ schematic ] satisfies the equation @xmath24 if one considers sources that are very far away , then @xmath25 .",
    "hence the lens equation takes a simplified form @xmath26 in terms on the two dimensional projected density @xmath27 of the lens equation ( [ def ] ) can be recast in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29is the value of the projected mass density at the point @xmath30 from the center of the lens , @xmath30 is the impact parameter , and @xmath21 the surface area in a polar ( @xmath31 ) coordinate system .",
    "the center of the lens is made to coincide with the center of the preferred coordinate system for simplicity and owing to the cylindrical symmetry . defining a dimensionless parameter @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the critical density , a reference measure to determine the strength of the lens from an observer s stand point , see for example ( subramanian & cowling 1986 ; schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath18 is the distance between the lens and the observer . using equation ( [ kappa ] ) and",
    "equation ( [ critden ] ) in equation ( [ lensden ] ) and scaling the radial coordinate using the relation , @xmath35 , yields @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the angular position of the image , as seen by the observer located at a distance @xmath18 , corresponding to an impact radius @xmath30 . a scalar potential @xmath38 can be defined such that , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the polar angular coordinate . comparing equation ( [ scalarpot ] ) with equation ( [ lensden2 ] ) and noting that @xmath41 , @xmath42 a generalized lens equation can be obtained by using equation ( [ scalardef ] ) in equation ( [ lens ] ) : @xmath43 essentially equation ( [ sol ] ) is a mapping from @xmath44 , as the observer traces the ray back to the source .",
    "the numerical solution of equation ( [ sol ] ) yields the image locations .",
    "the @xmath45 potential of the lens plane , then appears in the lens equation as elements of the inverse metric @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 is a function of @xmath48 ( radius ) only , owing to the circular symmetry . in general",
    "it is a function of two parameters of a polar coordinate system . in other words , the source and the image locations",
    "do not align on a straight line .     and the image locations @xmath23 for three different scenarios .",
    "the continuous curve represents the solutions of the lens equation for a centrally condensed lens .",
    "the disjoint set of curves delineates a point lens of the same mass and the straight line corresponds to the absence of a lens , where unlensed source positions and image positions coincide at all times . ]",
    "the solutions to the lens equation have a maximum of three roots .",
    "any vertical line in the @xmath49 plane corresponds to a fixed source location , the points of intersection of which are the corresponding image locations .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ betatheta ] shows that sources far from the optic axis are seen as a single image .",
    "the @xmath49 curves are conformal transformations for the mapping @xmath44 for every observer location @xmath18 .",

    "[ betatheta ] is based on an inverted map that is used to calculate the magnification .    at @xmath50",
    "the two images are equally separated from the optic axis .",
    "the assumed spherical symmetry of the lens will generate a circular einstein ring on the lens plane .",
    "the formation of a real einstein ring requires that a source be placed exactly along the line joining the observer through the center of the lens , which , for realistic cases , only occurs for sources of finite size .",
    "nevertheless , an einstein ring still has theoretical significance since it separates sets of images @xcite .",
    "for example , as the source moves behind the lens , no source image will ever be seen to cross an einstein ring .     along the optic axis .",
    "the curve ( @xmath51 ) corresponds to the sun and curve ( @xmath1 ) corresponds to a homogenous lens with a radius and mean density equal to the sun .",
    "the angle subtended at the limb of the sun in both cases converge to @xmath52    it is important to make a distinction between what is meant by focal length for an optical lens as apposed to a gravitational lens .",
    "the focal length of an optical lens is the distance between the center of the lens and the point where paraxial light rays converge or appear to diverge .",
    "the definition of deflection angle is @xmath53 where @xmath1 , @xmath54 and @xmath2 are the impact parameter , focal length and deflection angle respectively .",
    "the gravitational lens has a focal length for each impact parameter bounded by a minimum focal length .",
    "this is because the deflection angle is not a linear function of impact parameter .",
    "paraxial light rays converge at different points along the optic axis .",
    "the existence of multiple images is a necessary condition for a consistent definition of focal length . past the minimum focal length , the observed merger of two source images results in the formation of an einstein ring",
    ". numerical simulations ( discussed more in the appendix ) involving different values of @xmath18 and burke s odd number theorem will impose the following mathematical condition , for the existence of multiple images @xcite : @xmath55 the least value of @xmath18 that conforms to the above condition , the minimum focal length , is found numerically to be @xmath56 au .",
    "this implies that , for values of @xmath18 less than @xmath56 au there are no multiple images and hence no focal point .",
    "the perfect alignment of the source , lens and the observer at a distance less than @xmath56 au will not result in the formation of einstein ring .",
    "not only does the sun s mass density decrease monotonically with radius , but its mass density projected onto a lens plane also decreases monotonically with radius .",
    "surface density normalized to the critical surface density needed to generate multiple images is referred to as a dimensionless surface density @xmath57 and is a measure of the strength of the lens @xcite . if @xmath58 for _ some _ regions on the lens then the lens is termed  strong . \" for instructive comparisons to our sun , a  constant density \" sphere of radius @xmath9 with a volume density equal to the average density of the sun is used .",
    "a  weak \" lens is characterized by @xmath59 and can not produce multiple images @xcite .",
    "the constant density sphere does not produce multiple images at @xmath60 au .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ critden ] , where curve ( @xmath1 ) has a value of @xmath59 throughout the entire the lens at 23.5 au .",
    "weak lenses are only weak for observers sufficiently close ",
    "observers further than some minimal focal length will see the same object as a strong lens that creates multiple images . in case of the constant density sphere of solar mass",
    ", this value for @xmath18 is @xmath61 au .",
    "the validity of equation ( [ multiplecond ] ) implies that , the transition of the lens from being weak to strong should have at least so many points , such that the @xmath62 curve is continuous at the minimum focal length .",

    "the dimensionless surface density parameter suggests that the transparent sun is a strong lens just above @xmath56 au and a homogeneous model lens is a weak lens @xmath66 at the same @xmath18 .",
    "the very same model lens is capable of producing multiple images at observer  lens distance ( @xmath18 ) greater than @xmath67 au . ]    alternatively , the minimum focal length of the sun can be obtained by using the values of the mass enclosed and the impact parameter corresponding to the value of @xmath68 . using equation ( [ focal ] ) and the substituting the value @xmath69 and the radius of the enclosed mass @xmath70 one obtains a focal length of @xmath71 au , which lies between the orbits of uranus and neptune .",
    "the lens plane is defined as the plane perpendicular to the line joining a point source and a fixed observer . according to the odd number theorem for transparent gravitational lenses @xcite",
    ", the observer will see an odd number of images of the point source no matter what position the center of the lens occupies in the lens plane .",
    "areas might exist in the lens plane where the lens center can be placed to create a specific odd number of images visible to the observer .",

    ", areas might exist in the source plane where a point source can be placed so the ( fixed ) lens creates a specific odd number of images visible to the ( fixed ) observer .",
    "the boundaries between these areas of the source plane are called caustics . for spherical lenses ,",
