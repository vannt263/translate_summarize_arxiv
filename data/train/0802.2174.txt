    "furthermore , this would be inefficient , because we know that a galaxy needs to be massive and not too distant to efficiently distort and strongly magnify a more distant galaxy .",
    "we therefore limit our search to intrinsically bright galaxies at moderate redshifts .",
    "furthermore , for this first investigation of the cosmos field , we only look at early - type galaxies ( classified spectroscopically by the photometric redshift code ) , which generally have a simple , smooth surface brightness distribution . once again , we emphasize that the main reason for applying these selection criteria to the photometric redshift catalog is to reduce the sample of galaxies that need to be visually inspected .",
    "it is highly possible that additional strong lens systems will be found around galaxies that do not belong to our search sample . the number of strong lensing systems that we find is thus a lower limit to the total number of strong lensing systems in the cosmos field .    to search for potential lenses , we select galaxies according to the following criteria :    * their photometric redshift must be in the range @xmath19 .",
    "the lower redshift bound of @xmath20 is chosen to ensure that galaxies will indeed produce lensing events and the upper bound is essentially motivated to ensure a good accuracy on the photometric redshift given that no deep infrared data are yet available for the cosmos field .",
    "the galaxy is retained if the error bars at 68% confidence level overlap , even partially , the redshift range [ 0.2;1.0 ] .",
    "* their luminosity must be @xmath21  mag , on the assumption that the brightest galaxies are also likely to be the most massive ones with the largest cross - section for lensing .",
    "* we limit our search to early - type galaxies that have been spectrally classified as such by the sed fitting of our photometric redshift algorithm .",
    "the motivation for this criterion is to focus on massive systems with a simple light distribution that is easy to fit and to subtract .",
    "we obtain a final ` p ' catalog of 9452 bright elliptical galaxies ( see fig .  [ mvz ] ) .",
    "further strong lensing searches using automated software will certainly relax these criteria .",
    "during the course of our visual inspection , we serendipitously found some additional strong lens systems in which the lensing galaxy did not comply with the above limits .",
    "although these constitute an inhomogeneous sample , we add them to the list of strong lensing systems for completeness .",
    "those systems are identified in tables [ photom ] , and [ photom1 ] .",
    "we inspect visually a postage - stamp 10@xmath2210 acs image surrounding all galaxies in the ` p ' catalog , looking for lensed features ( tangential arcs or multiple images ) .",
    "the search box size limits us to r@xmath23 .",
    "consequently , this puts an upper limit on the mass scale for the lens , which excludes clusters as a possible main deflector .",
    "this inspection was performed by 5 of the co - authors using the ds9 fits image visualization tool .",
    "our strategy reduced the 9452 galaxies in the ` p ' catalog to an ` e ' catalog of 337 candidates , with intentionally loose selection criteria to avoid excluding any real lenses at this stage .",
    "a color image is always useful to verify potential lens candidates . indeed ,",
    "gravitational lensing is achromatic , thus a gravitational arc or multiple images systems should have a consistent color across the image(s ) .",
    "furthermore , the color of a lensed galaxy will only rarely have the same color as the main lensing galaxy .",
    "this color test hence provides a good way to discriminate false strong lensing cases .",
    "however , with our particular combination of ground- and space - based data ( especially when the seeing approaches 1@xmath24 ) , the color test is only useful for arcs more distant than @xmath00.5 from the lensing galaxy , because of strong contamination from the wings of the lensing galaxy .",
    "for the 337 systems in the ` e ' catalog , we produced pseudo - color images made from the `` best psf '' stacks of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 _ subaru _ images , using the rgb feature in the ds9 software , as well as ground - based images sharpened with the acs images .",
    "the color images use the acs f814w data as an illumination map and the _ subaru _ @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 images as a color map . to achieve this each _ subaru _",
    "image is divided by the average of the three _ subaru _ images , then multiplied by the acs f814w image .",
    "this preserves the flux ratio between images , while replacing the overall illumination pattern with the f814w data .",
    "each image is then smoothed by a 1 pixel gaussian to reduce the noise and divided by @xmath31 to enhance the color difference between star forming and passive galaxies .",
    "the processed @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 images are then assigned to the blue , green , and red channels respectively .",
    "the resulting images have the high spatial resolution of the acs imaging , but color gradients at ground based resolution .",

    "the pseudo - color image shows blue knots of star formation all around the disc of this galaxy , suggesting that the arc - like features are most probably genuine regions of the main galaxy .",
    "fitting and extracting the foreground lens galaxy light from the images reveals the shape of the more distant , lensed object . for this work , a robust 2-dimensional fit to the galaxy surface brightness distribution",
    "is derived using @xmath32 ( simard 1998 , marleau & simard 1998 ) .",
    "we adopt a srsic bulge plus exponential disc parametrisation to describe the two - dimensional surface brightness distribution of the lensing galaxy light profile .",
    "the srsic law is parametrised by means of the total flux in the bulge , the srsic index @xmath33 , the bulge ellipticity ( @xmath34 ) , the position angle of the bulge and the effective radius of the bulge @xmath35 .",
    "the exponential profile depends on the photometric disk total flux , the disk scale - length , the disk position angle and the disk inclination .",
    "the @xmath32 software finds the best fitting values for all of these parameters , and provides them as an output of the decomposition process .",
    "in addition to the structural parameters for each object , we calculate a model image of each galaxy , which is convolved with a point spread function before comparison with real data .",

    "it is difficult to conclude without any spectroscopic data whether the ring is due to gravitational lensing or if it is a genuine part of the central galaxy ( like a ring - galaxy or a shell ) .",
    "the main argument in favor of them being lens candidates is the strong color difference between the elliptical central objects and the ring features , suggesting they are not physically related .",

    "nevertheless we observe some exceptions : some systems have a large einstein radius in comparison to their arc radius : cosmos  0018 + 3845 ( @xmath89=0.40 , @xmath90=1.44 ) , 0047 + 5023 ( @xmath89=0.70 , @xmath90=1.29 ) and 5914 + 1219 ( @xmath89=1.86 , @xmath90=2.82 ) .",
    "for the three systems , there is a strong external shear added to the sie .",
    "this may indicates the presence of a massive structure in the direction to the source or in its vicinity that could have stretched the angular separation between the images and/or biased strongly the estimation of the velocity dispersion , and hence of the estimation of the einstein radius of the lensing galaxy .",
    "in this paper we present 67 new strong galaxy - galaxy lensing candidates found by visual inspection of the cosmos field . from a catalog of 278,526 galaxies with photometric redshifts ( capak et al .",
    "2007 ) , we have selected a sub - catalog of 9452 bright galaxies ( m@xmath91 - 20  mag ) , at intermediate redshift ( @xmath92 ) and spectrally early type .",
    "the selection criteria for this sub - catalog were mainly motivated by the purpose of reducing the sample of galaxies to be visually inspected . from the visual inspection of acs / i@xmath93-band stamp images of 10@xmath2210 ,",
    "we have built a sample of 337 possible lenses with sizes up to r@xmath945 .",
    "this number is reduced to 67 strong galaxy - galaxy lensing candidates after a final cut based on an inspection of the pseudo - color images , and the fit and subtraction of the lensing galaxy luminosity profile .",
    "there are 47 candidates with a single arclet and 20 candidates with multiple images of a background source or with a large curved arc , called the `` best systems '' in this paper .",
    "we have produced a simple mass model ( sie+shear ) for each of the best candidates . in a few cases ,",
    "we have also been able to predict the existence and direction of an external shear contribution .",
    "comparing the velocity dispersions to those of lenses in the the slacs and castles samples , it is apparent that we are probing a slightly higher range of velocity dispersion .",
    "nevertheless , massive objects in the immediate vicinity of the cosmos lenses , and the rough assumption concerning the source redshift , can explain this result .",
    "we have inferred the einstein radius for the lensing galaxies considering that they are isothermal spheres , and compared these values with the arc radius .",
    "the derived einstein radii agree well with the observed arc radii , making us confident that the sample consists mainly of genuine lens systems .",
    "the `` visual inspection '' approach is long and tedious , and does not ensure a full understanding of the completeness of the strong lenses sample .",
    "nevertheless , our meticulously - obtained large sample of strong lenses , even if incomplete , provides a valuable catalog to help develop , test and improve automatic strong lens - finding algorithms for similar data - sets .",
    "such work is currently in progress ( cabanac et al .",
    "2007 , marshall et al .",
    "2007 , seidel & bartlemann 2007 ) .",
    "also , in future work ( faure et al .  2007 ) the direct study of the spatial correlation between large - scale structure in the cosmos field ( scoville et al .  2007 , massey et al .  2007 ) and",
    "the strong lenses discovered here will allow us to measure the impact of the total , projected mass distribution along the line of sight to a given strong lens , as recently investigated for three strong lenses in the aegis survey ( moustakas et al .",
    "a spectroscopic follow - up of the lens candidates is in progress at the vlt using the fors1-multi - object spectroscopy capability .",
    "this will allow us to measure precisely the redshift of both the lens and the source , and to explore the close neighborhood of the lens , thus allowing a definite measurement of the mass of each strong lensing galaxy .",
    "finally , this study gives a lower limit on the number of strong lenses expected in future deep space surveys such as the proposed jdem / snap multicolor weak - lensing survey .",
    "indeed , we expect to find at least 10 strong lenses per square degrees .",
    "thus for a 10 000 square degree survey , we should discover about 100 000 strong lenses thus allowing a high precision statistical analysis of the mass properties of galaxies and its evolution over time .",
