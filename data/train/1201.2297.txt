    "dna and carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) are interesting and important systems in nanoscience .",
    "they have been the subject of many investigations in the past two decades@xcite .",
    "dna is composed of two long polymer strands organized in a double helical structure , where each strand consists of repeating units ( nucleotides)@xcite .",
    "cnts are quasi - one dimensional cylindrically wrapped graphene sheets with properties uniquely defined by theregistry dependence of the wrapping given by a chirality index @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "recently , using molecular dynamics simulations researchers have proposed molecular tweezers combining dna and cnts @xcite - a device with further technological and scientific potential .",
    "a theoretical model of a geometrical soliton of dna structure was constructed for the first time by englander @xcite ( e model ) . in this model ,",
    "one of the strands of the dna is represented as a chain of pendula interacting with the another fixed similar strand .",
    "the e model explains the existence of dna open state due to nonlinear excitations .",
    "in addition , the dna structure and dyanmics has been modeled in terms of the peyrard - bishop ( pb ) model @xcite , which has been succssessful in explaining dna denaturation transitions , pre - melting dynamics , and thermal transport . in the pb model ,",
    "backbone of dna is described as chains of particles with nearest neighboring potentials . however , the models ignore the helicoidal structure of the dna molecule , the context of dna flexibility , and the properties associated with it .",
    "cnts are chemically inert and they interact with other materials via long - ranged dispersive forces , such as van der waals ( vdw ) forces .",
    "the vdw interactions of graphitic nanostructures can be described via pairwise interatomic lennard - jones ( lj ) potentials @xcite .",
    "this approach relies on knowledge of the coupling hamaker constants and it predicts the equilibrium separation correctly . the lj potential has been applied to model mutual interaction between various cnts as well as cnt based devices @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the dynamics of hybrid dna / cnt nanotweezers by employing the pb and vdw - lj models .",

    "it means that the melting temperatures corresponds to @xmath61 @xmath28 for @xmath56 ev/@xmath44 and @xmath62 @xmath28 for @xmath57 ev/@xmath44 . as a result , there is a possibility to obtain the melting temperature by observing the velocity of stretching .",
    "the vdw interaction between the cnt parts of the dna nanotweezers is described via the lennard - jones ( lj ) approximation .",
    "this approach is widely used in calculating disperssive interactions between graphitic nanostructures because of its relative simplicity and satisfactory results in determining their equilibrium configurations @xcite .",
    "the lj potential is essentially a pairwise apprximation , and for extended systems , one typically perfroms integration over the volumes of the interacting objects . for cnts ,",
    "the integration is over the surfaces of hollow cylinders with radii corresponding to the radii of the nanotubes .",

    "[ fig:00 ] .    then , applying the first derivative with respect to @xmath83 , we obtain the van der waals interaction force per unit length @xmath84",
    "as a prototype , we take that both cnts are identical with the chiral vector @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and lengths @xmath87 @xmath88 . the total hamiltonian for the system",
    "is composed of two term , that account for the stretching and van der waals interaction - @xmath89 .",
    "because of the relatively weak vdw force between the tubes , @xmath90 is treated as a perturbation compared to @xmath14 .",
    "the parameters of dna are @xmath91 @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xmath94 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the previous section is the wave function and energy of the ground state of dna without the presence of cnts .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we show results for the cnt vdw perturbative force correction as a function of tempertaure and the stretching force . fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] indicates that @xmath97 decreases as @xmath38 increases .",
    "the stretching force goes to zero at the critical temperature since the properties of dna change when @xmath38 reaches to @xmath98 .",
    "( color online ) the first - order energy is caused by the van der waals interactions between two cnts.,width=340 ]    obviously , the wave function is temperature - dependent , so the energy and energy shift are functions of temperature .",
    "the value of @xmath96 for three values of @xmath5 at this range of temperature varies from @xmath99 mev to @xmath100 mev .",
    "it means that the influence of the van der waals interaction on the wave function and the energy in the ground state is minor .",
    "we can calculate separately the interactions of dna and cnts .",
    "an additional point is that the larger temperature is , the smaller the first - order pertubation of energy is .",
    "a simple reason for this problem is that when temperature increases , two dna strands are opened @xcite and it leads to a rapid growth of distance between two cnts .",
    "it is remarkable that we have studied the van der waals interaction and the pertubation energy between two parallel cnts .",
    "this configuration also is used in order to calculate all of the van der waals interactions below . nevertheless , in actual cases , we have two crossed cnts .",
    "the dispersion interaction in real biosystems is weaker than that in the parallel state .",
    "therefore , we can utilize the wave function @xmath95 in the following calculations without addional terms due to the perturbation theory .",
    "( color online ) the unzipping force as a function of temperature .,width=340 ]    it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , at the critical temperature @xmath98 , the stretching force vanishes because two strands of dna are broken for @xmath25 .",
    "the opening force of dna is very large at low temperature .",
    "the smaller the temperature is , the smaller distance between two strands is .",
    "this force decreases when increasing temperature since the separation distance is larger and larger .",
    "these results have aggrement about the range of magnitude force with experimental data and previous calculations @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath5 causes to the growth of stretching force due to the fact that the binding of dna rises .    lets consider the interaction between two cnts attached in the ends of dna",
    "there are several types of dna existing in nature such as b - dna and z - dna . since the diameter of dna is approximately @xmath101 nm for b - dna and @xmath102 nm for z - dna .",
    "we assume that the initial distance between two centers of cnts is @xmath103 nm .",
    "it is important to note that the van der waals force is attractive at this range of distance and the sign of this force should be minus .",
    "the magnitude of van der waals interaction between two cnts is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "( color online ) the van der waals forces between two parallel cnts ( 5,0 ) and ( 6,0 ) as a function of the separation distance between two centers of cnts.,width=340 ]    for @xmath43 ev/@xmath44 , if @xmath104 @xmath28 , the stretching force is much larger than the van der waals force of cnts ( 5,0 ) and ( 6,0 ) at the initial state .",
    "therefore , it is easy to control the opening and closing of dna by cooling down or heating up . at low temperature ,",
    "the contribution of the dispersion force in the movement of dna strands is minor .",
    "however , it can rise to significant role when @xmath105 @xmath28 .",
    "we can do the same way with @xmath56 ev/@xmath44 and @xmath57 ev/@xmath44 .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows the forces between cnt ( 5,0 ) and different cnts at the certain distances . in order to control the opening and closing of nanotweezers ,",
    "the van der waals force is weaker than the stretching forces .",
    "it is difficult to operate the movement of nanotweezers if two cnts have large radii .",
    "( color online ) the van der waals forces between cnt ( 5,0 ) and another cnt.,width=340 ]    when we heat up the biosystem , two ends of dna are separated by the stretching force . at the larger temperature ,",
    "the unzipping force is much larger than the van der waals interactions , the nanotweezers are opened .",
    "the obtained results agree with the previous simulation study @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our nanorobots , the movements of cnts can be controlled by changing temperature .",
    "in addition , the van der waals interaction between two cylinders is proportional to the length of tubes . if we want to have the smaller van der waals interaction , it is possible to choose the length 1 nm or 2 nm .",
    "another point is that long cnts are bent because of the van der waals interaction . as a consequence",
    ", the length of tubes should not be large in designing the bio - nanorobots .",
    "the use of intelligence , sensing and actuation nanodevices in surgery , medical treatments and materials science is a reality which has become a hot topic in the biomedical industry and research in recent years .",
    "bio - nanorobots provide further advance not only in the nanotechnology , but also efficient approaches for disease treatment .",
    "our studies showed the behavior and architecture of the bio - nanotweezers .",
    "the temperature dependence of the opening displacements of tweezers is presented and gives researchers some principles to understand the operation of dna - based molecular machines and devices . in addition , the velocity and acceleration of the opening and closing tweezers as a function of time are speculated .",
    "the theoretical calculations are easy to understand and agree qualitatively with the previous works",
