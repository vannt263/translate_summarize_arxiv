    "this paper aims at filling this gap . to fully motivate theorem  [ th : th2d ] , we have to explain the interest in applying the s - procedure whereas there exist more sophisticated relaxation schemes such as moment - sos ( sum of squares ) , or lasserre s hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it could be possible to write @xmath37 with @xmath38 and * i * being the imaginary unit , and then to prove the existence of a solution to ( [ eq : stein ] ) that would be polynomial with respecto to @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",

    "the derivation of these expressions is a key step in the design of stabilizing control laws as highlighted in  @xcite where a necessary and sufficient lmi condition for state feedback stabilization is obtained ... provided that theorem  [ th : th2d ] is proved !",

    "+ the lmis are a tool whose utility and popularity are no longer to be demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "they consitute an effective approach to solve numerous problems in automatic control .",
    "some of those problems unfortunaltely involve parameter - dependent lmis",
    ". typically , analyzing the stability of linear systems against parameter uncertainties amounts to assessing the existence of a solution ( _ i.e. _ a lyapunov function ) which itself depends on these parameters  @xcite , which is a difficult problem . in order to efficiently relax such a problem ,",
    "the question of the way this solution could depend on the parameters is of course important .",
    "bliman made a very important step in the understanding of such a question .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite , he proved that when the lmi depends on real parameters , its solution can be considered polynomial with respect to the parameters without conservatism .",
    "the question of its minimal degree is still open . in the remainder of the paper , inspired by the work of bliman  @xcite and motivated by our will to fully justify the work in  @xcite",
    ", we discuss the possibility for the solutions to complex parameter - dependent lmis to be assumed polynomial with respect to the complex parameters .",
    "the purpose is not to provide a complete complex counterpart with a complete proof , which would be very redundant with bliman s work , but to insist on the steps where some adaptations are required and to highlight the currently existing limits which prevent the complete generalization of bliman s result .",
    "but it must be kept in mind that the case with only one complex parameter is of special interest for us to prove theorem  [ th : th2d ] .",
    "in this section , we recall bliman s theorem and give a very brief outline of his proof .",
    "let us define the following expression :    @xmath42\\in\\r^p,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a compact subset of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , ... , @xmath47 are mappings defined in @xmath43 and taking values in the set of symmetric matrices of @xmath48 .",

    "the result is very strong for two reasons .",
    "first , it proves that there exists a function @xmath57 which can be used as a solution for every @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , it states that this function can be polynomial .",

    "+   + * outline of the proof of theorem  [ th : bliman ] . *",
    "the proof consists in four steps :    * it starts with noting that , if for any @xmath52 , there exists @xmath53 such that @xmath54 holds , then there exists @xmath58 such that for any @xmath52 , the inequality @xmath59 has a nonempty set of solutions .",
    "it leads to define the set - valued map @xmath60 which , for any @xmath52 , associates the nonempty closed convex set @xmath61   + ( note that any @xmath62 satisfies  @xmath63 . )",

    "the last step applies weierstrass approximation theorem  @xcite to prove that each real - valued entry of @xmath64 is the limit of a sequence of polynomials , in the sense of uniform convergence .",
    "our purpose leads us to discuss the extension of theorem  [ th : bliman ] where @xmath43 is a compact subset of @xmath68 and where each @xmath69 belongs to @xmath70 .",
    "the three first steps of bliman s proof can be preserved .",
    "all the discussion concerns the fourth step .",
    "we will show that the extension to the complex case is not so obvious and deserves a little attention .",
    "in this section , we discuss to what extend complex parameters can be considered in  theorem  [ th : bliman ] . but",
    "before doing so , we remind the reader of the needed mathematical theorems .    _",

    "in other words , it is possible to approximate a continuous real - valued function @xmath64 by a real - valued polynomial function with any desired accuracy , provided that the degree of the underlying polynomial is large anough .",
    "bliman actually applies an extension which is the stone - weierstrass theorem .",

    "therefore we state the next theorem    [ th : ndbis ] if system  ( [ eq : roesser_n ] ) is time - relevant stable in the sense of @xmath178 , then there exists a solution @xmath184 to inequality  ( [ eq : stein ] ) over @xmath185 which complies with the ilfr - based expression @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 , @xmath189 .    *",

    "it can be written @xmath192 or @xmath193 .",
    "those two expressions are also special instances of ilfrs .",
    "since ilfrs of ilfrs are also ilfrs , then it is possible to rewrite the solution @xmath194 as @xmath195 given in  ( [ eq : pbullet ] ) .",
    "@xmath31 +   + the question is now that of ( possibly exactly ) relaxing conditions such as  ( [ eq : stein ] ) . it can not be addressed here unless by unduly increasing the size of the article",
    "however , when @xmath196 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath87 ) , theorem  [ th : th2d ] was exactly relaxed in  @xcite in the purely discrete case through s - prcocedure . using a close by different approach , the mixed case was efficiently tackled in  @xcite where sos - relaxations were prefered to s - procedure .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite , upperbounds on the degree of the polynomial are provided , which is very interesting from a theoretical point of view .",
    "but the bounds are still far larger than the degrees actually required to assess stability , and therefore might not be easily exploited on practical examples .",
    "+ an exact lmi - based relaxation is provided in  @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting because unlike the other approaches , it does not require any degree to be guessed .",
    "therefore , instability can be proved by such a condition .",
    "nevertheless , it is restricted to the discrete case , and considers fornasini - marchesini ( fm ) models instead of roesser ( r ) models .",
    "of course , fm and r models can be converted to each other in the control - free case but it is no longer true in the presence of a control input .",
    "so any attempt to extend the result to design may clearly separate the two models .",
    "moreover , examples exposed in  @xcite tend to show that the condition of  @xcite , unless more direct , may not necessarily be more attractive than  @xcite in terms of computation time . furthermore",

    "+ at last , in  @xcite , the first exploitation of theorem  [ th : th2d ] is made for control and a nesssary and sufficient condition for state feedback structural stabilization of 2d discrete models is proposed .",
    "this is a major advantage compared to other approaches .",
    "the generalization to continuous and mixed cases is under investigation . + for @xmath197 ( or @xmath198 ) , the s - procedure - based reasoning used in  @xcite might be extended but also probably lead to a conservative lmi condition , hence our focus on the 2d case .",
    "+ once again , the reader must be aware that the previously evoked results  @xcite rely on theorem  [ th : th2d ] whereas it had not been clearly proved yet .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is to fill this gap and to embed this result into a more general formalism .",
    "in this note , we proposed a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of 2d ( discrete , continuous or mixed ) roesser models which consists of an lmi system where the solutions are polynomial w.r.t .",
    "a complex parameter describing either the unit circle or the imaginary axis ( or either the closed unit disc or the closed right half - plane ) . insights to generalize the results to higher dimensions were also proposed .",
    "it has to be noticed that this result is in accordance with what was obtained in the discrete case through a completely different approach in  @xcite and that a recent paper proposed a quite similar result in the mixed continuous - discrete - case  @xcite .",
    "but the present approach can offer a general method to derive exact relaxations of 2d - stability conditions for all the cases  @xcite .",
    "at last , but not least , a first exploitation of this result for the synthesis of control laws was made in  @xcite .",

    "<S> the aim of this short communiqu is to adapt a result established by bliman , related to the possible approximation of the solutions to real - parameter - dependent linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) , to the special context of stability analysis of 2d discrete roesser models . </S>",
    "<S> while bliman considered the case of lmis involving several _ real _ parameters , which is especially crucial for the analysis of linear systems against parametric deflections , the stability of roesser models leads to consider lmis with only one single _ complex _ parameter . </S>",

    "<S> this is why the present note discusses precautions to be taken concerning this case before applying the results in a 2d context . </S>",
