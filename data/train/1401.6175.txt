    "in some merging galaxy clusters , mpc - scale diffuse radio synchrotron emission is found , which indicates the presence of relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the diffuse emission is classified depending on the location , morphology , and polarization properties .",
    "radio halos have sizes of about a mpc and are centrally located in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has been proposed that radio halos trace particles re - accelerated by turbulence generated during a cluster merger event @xcite . in an alternative model , radio halos",
    "are produced by secondary electrons injected during proton - proton collisions in the icm .",
    "secondary models are challenged by the large energy content of cosmic ray protons needed to explain radio halos with very steep spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by the non - detection of @xmath5-rays from radio halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for radio halos",
    "there is a correlation between x - ray luminosity and radio power / luminosity ( the @xmath6 correlation ) , with the most luminous clusters hosting the most powerful radio halos .",
    "there is also a strong bimodality observed in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "merging clusters that host radio halos follow the @xmath6 scaling relation , while for other relaxed clusters the upper limits on the radio power are well below the correlation @xcite .",
    "the radio halo power also correlates with the integrated sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect signal @xcite given by the compton @xmath7 parameter , which traces the integrated pressure along the line of sight .",
    "the sz signal is expected to be a better indicator of cluster mass than the x - ray luminosity and should be less affected by the cluster dynamical state .",
    "in addition , there are indications that the fraction of clusters with diffuse radio emission is larger for sz selected samples @xcite , which suggests that x - rays and sz statistics provide complementary information on the radio - merger connection",
    ".    the majority of the presently known halos and relics are located at low and moderate redshifts ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "not much is known about the radio relic and halo population beyond @xmath9 , with only a one cluster known that hosts diffuse radio emission at @xmath10 @xcite and two around a redshift of 0.55 .",
    "radio halos and relics are in general difficult to study owing to their low surface brightness and steep radio spectrum , making them faint at high frequencies . since they are already difficult to detect in nearby clusters , only the most luminous ones can be detected beyond @xmath9 . according to the @xmath6 correlation",
    "the most luminous halos are located in the most massive ( i.e. , x - ray luminous ) clusters .",
    "we have therefore started to observe a sample of massive @xmath9 clusters with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) to carry out a first systematic characterization of the distant halo ( and relic ) population . in this letter",

    "the data were reduced using a semi - automatic pipeline employing the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) , parseltongue and obit @xcite .",
    "the reduction consisted of automatic rfi removal and subtraction @xcite , bandpass and gain calibration , and subsequent cycles of self - calibration .",

    "a careful visual inspection of the image reveals an increase in the `` noise '' at the cluster position , hinting at a large extended low - surface brightness component . to make this emission more visible , we subtracted the emission from compact radio sources from the uv - data . for this",

    "[ fig : radiolrandhr ] ( right panel ) .",
    "we subtracted the clean components obtained from this image from the uv - data .",
    "we then re - imaged the data , excluding data above 8  k@xmath35 and using a taper of 5  k@xmath35 ( units are the distance to the 30% percent point of the gaussian in k@xmath35 ) to enhance diffuse emission .",
    "this resulted in an image with a resolution of @xmath36 .",
    "we verified that the source subtraction procedure did not leave any positive residuals , by visually inspecting the low - resolution image at the locations of several dozen compact sources that are located throughout the primary beam .",
    "we clearly detect diffuse emission at the cluster position with a total extent of about 2.2 , corresponding to a physical extent ( @xmath37 ) of 0.9  mpc at the distance of the cluster .",
    "some emission from the double lobe source to the north remains visible because of the extended nature of this source .",
    "source c and f were not cleaned in the data with the short uv - spacings removed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radiolrandhr ] ; right panel ) , as their peak fluxes fall below the clean box threshold . after subtracting their contribution , we measure an integrated flux ( @xmath38 ) of @xmath2  mjy for the diffuse emission , summing the emission in the circular region indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : radiolrandhr ] .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is based on a 10% absolute flux calibration uncertainty and the statistical uncertainty due to map noise , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "we note that the actual uncertainty could be somewhat larger , as it is not fully clear what the area is over which we should integrate the halo flux .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] we overlay the radio emission on an xmm mos+pn 0.53.0  kev x - ray image .",
    "the radio emission roughly follows the x - ray emission , although the radio emission seems to be somewhat more extended in the northeast direction .",
    "it should be noted however that the radio emission has a very low surface brightness and therefore not too many conclusions should be drawn based on the brightness distribution .",
    "we classify the source as a radio halo , since the emission coincides with most of the x - ray emission from the icm .",
    "in addition , the very low surface brightness is typical for a radio halo .",
    "the fact that the cluster is undergoing a merger , based on the optical and x - ray data , provides further support for this interpretation .",
    "if we assume a spectral index of @xmath40 for the radio halo , we obtain a 1.4  ghz k - corrected radio power of @xmath41  w  hz@xmath4 .",
    "it is thought that distant radio halos have on average steeper spectral indices than their low - z counterparts .",
    "if we assume a spectral index of @xmath42 this would result in a ( k - corrected ) radio power of @xmath43  w  hz@xmath4 .",
    "this difference in the radio power between @xmath31 and @xmath42 is thus about the same as the uncertainty introduced by the flux measurement error .",
    "the position of plck  g147.316.6 in the @xmath44 and @xmath45 diagrams is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrs ] . based on the @xmath46 correlation",
    "we would expect a power of about @xmath47  w  hz@xmath4 , using the _ bces bisector ( rh only ) _ fit from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  3 ) . given the intrinsic scatter in the correlation , measurement uncertainties and unknown spectral index , the observed radio power of plck  g147.316.6 is consistent with being on the @xmath46 correlation .",
    "based on the @xmath48 _ bces bisector ( rh only ) _ fit from @xcite , we expect a radio power of @xmath49  w  hz@xmath4 , almost the same as the prediction from the @xmath46 relation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the measured radio power is in agreement with that expected from the @xmath46 and @xmath50 correlations .",
    "we have discovered diffuse radio emission in the cluster plck  g147.316.6 with the gmrt at 610  mhz .",
    "we classify this diffuse emission as a 0.9  mpc radio halo . for the radio halo we measure an integrated flux of @xmath2  mjy , resulting in a radio power of @xmath51  w  hz@xmath4 at the redshift of 0.65 .",
    "this value is in agreement with what is expected from the known correlations between x - ray luminosity and sz signal and radio power .",
    "the detection of radio halos beyond @xmath52 has generally been considered more difficult because of the strong increase of the inverse compton ( ic ) losses with redshift , which decreases the radio halo power .",
    "in addition , distant halos are expected to have steeper spectral indices than their low - z counterparts .",
    "this is caused by the increase of the ic losses with redshift , which limit the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons in these systems , and the assumption the radio halo spectra have convex shapes as stochastic particle acceleration by mhd turbulence is believed to be an inefficient process .",
    "the detection of a radio halo in plck  g147.316.6 at @xmath11 now opens up the exciting opportunity to study a radio halo in a distant cluster in more detail .",
    "deep follow - up studies with the karl g. jansky vla and lofar will be pursued to determine the spectral index and polarization properties of the radio halo .",
    "our observations also suggest that detection and initial studies of distant radio halos are within the capabilities of the gmrt and that we should expect additional detections from our larger sample .",
