    "systematic surveys of the earliest stages of low - mass star formation provide vital information on the physics of cloud collapse . in particular , if complete samples of protostars and pre - stellar cores can be identified , their relative lifetimes can be estimated if it is assumed that the clouds are not being observed at a special time in their evolution .",
    "such studies are vital for differentiating between models of star formation , which can predict very different protostellar accretion histories . in some models ,",
    "the evolution of molecular cloud cores is controlled entirely by strong magnetic fields , leading to lifetimes determined by the ambipolar diffusion timescale , which is typically @xmath7  yr ( ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "however , recent 3-dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent , gravitationally unstable , clouds show that cores can form and evolve over only a few dynamical timescales , even if significant magnetic fields are present ( li et al .",
    "2000 ; heitsch , mac low , & klessen 2001 ) . for typical cloud conditions",
    ", this implies evolution on timescales of about @xmath8  yr .",
    "once a gravitationally unstable core has formed and started to collapse , the accretion rate of the protostar is governed by the initial conditions at the onset of collapse .",
    "the idealized collapse of a singular isothermal sphere ( shu 1977 ) proceeds with a uniform accretion rate . other accretion models starting from different initial conditions",
    "predict a short phase of rapid accretion , succeeded by a more or less constant accretion rate ( e.g. , foster & chevalier 1993 ; mclaughlin & pudritz 1997 ) .",
    "if evolutionary phases of different accretion rates can be identified observationally then their relative lifetimes can then be estimated , possibly enabling the discrimination between these different models .",
    "complete surveys of infrared protostars have been used to obtain good estimates for the lifetime of infrared protostars , in particular the class i , ii , and iii phases of protostellar evolution . from such surveys wilking et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and kenyon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) conclude that the class i phase lasts @xmath3  yr in the low - mass , star - forming regions of @xmath2 ophiuchus and taurus , and this lifetime is consistent with typical cloud collapse models ( e.g. , adams , lada , & shu 1987 ) . however , the timescales associated with the earlier phases of star formation , specifically the class  0 phase ( andr et al .  1993 ) and the pre - collapse phase ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "1994 ) , are much more uncertain . most samples of dense cores derive originally from catalogues of optically - selected dark clouds , which were subsequently searched for associated iras emission ( e.g. , beichman et al .",
    "1986 ; clemens & barvainis 1988 ; benson & myers 1989 ; lee & myers 1999 ; jijina , myers , & adams 1999 ) . since class",
    "protostars are typically too cold and faint to have been detected by iras , complete samples of both class  0 protostars and truly `` starless '' cores ( as opposed to cores lacking an associated iras source or 2  @xmath1 m emission ) have been difficult to obtain . in one of the few regions where complete samples of class  0 and class  i objects exist  the @xmath2 ophiuchi cloud  the results imply that the class  0 phase lasts only one tenth of the class  i phase in this region , i.e. , @xmath9  yr ( andr & montmerle 1994 ) . however , there are few , if any , good statistical constraints in other regions of star formation .",
    "the advent of large bolometer arrays on millimeter and submillimeter telescopes has made the first systematic surveys for the earliest phases of star formation possible .",
    "typical observing wavelengths , @xmath10 to 1  mm , lie towards the rayleigh - jeans side of the planck function for all reasonable dust temperatures @xmath11  k. millimeter and submillimeter dust emission is therefore an excellent tracer of the youngest embedded protostars and starless dense cores , which are regions of high dust column density that can be too cold for detection by far - infrared instruments . in this paper we present the second and concluding part of a survey , using the submillimeter camera scuba on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , of dust continuum emission from typical , nearby , molecular clouds forming low - mass stars .",
    "the observations are sufficiently sensitive to detect all the embedded protostars and starless cores above a certain mass limit , and so allow us to estimate the lifetimes of these earliest phases of star formation .",
    "in an earlier paper ( visser , richer , & chandler 2001 , hereafter paper i ) we presented initial results derived from images of the smaller clouds in the sample . here",
    "we include the images of the larger clouds , and using the full survey present a detailed analysis of the structure of the cores , their star forming properties , and the properties of their molecular outflows .",
    "we also estimate the relative and absolute lifetimes of the various pre - stellar and protostellar phases based on their detection rates .",
    "the clouds observed were selected from those listed as opacity class 6 in the lynds catalogue of dark nebulae , which contains 1802 optically - dark clouds selected from the poss plates ( lynds 1962 ) .",
    "lynds catalogued the clouds by eye based on their apparent opacity , using an arbitrary scale of 1 to 6 , with the class 6 clouds being the most opaque ( @xmath12 magnitudes ) .",
    "these estimates were based on a comparison of the cloud with a neighboring field on the poss plate , and the classification is therefore somewhat subjective .",
    "the lynds catalogue contains a total of 147 opacity class 6 clouds covering a total area of @xmath13 square degrees , with individual clouds having a mean minor axis of 4@xmath14 and major axis of 11@xmath14 .",
    "some of these clouds are small and round , like globules , but others are extended and filamentary .",
    "the optical appearance of most clouds is quiescent , with only a small fraction of the clouds looking shocked .",
    "star formation in lynds class 6 clouds has been studied by parker ( 1991 ) following a re - analysis of their positions ( parker 1988 ) and an investigation of their association with iras sources .",
    "however , the selection criteria he used based on iras detections failed to find the well - known class  0 source b335 ( l663 ) ( parker 1989 ) , demonstrating the importance of understanding the selection effects introduced by such wavelength - dependent criteria .",
    "our optical selection criterion corresponds to a limiting column density , and is biased towards finding nearby clouds .",
    "forty two opacity class 6 clouds were selected from the lynds catalogue with sizes and positions determined by the observing time allocated and observing mode available at the jcmt ( see section  [ obs_cont ] below ) .",
    "this resulted in an essentially random selection of clouds .",
    "the first to be observed were the small or filamentary clouds that could be mapped using the single scuba field of view , before the commissioning of large - area ( scan ) mapping .",
    "these results are presented in paper i. the larger clouds were mapped when scan mapping became available . because of the lst ranges allocated to the observations we were able to map several areas in @xmath2  ophiuchus , and more than one third of all the clouds are part of the @xmath2  ophiuchi cloud complex .",
    "the full sample contains no biases relating to size , star formation activity , or the presence of infrared emission , and so is statistically representative of nearby , dark clouds .",
    "the names and positions of all the clouds surveyed are given in table  [ tab_sample ] , along with identifications from the barnard ( 1927 ) catalogue ( b ) and the clemens & barvainis ( 1988 ) catalogue ( cb ) .",
    "the distances to nearby clouds can be difficult to determine because neither star counts nor kinematic determinations are very reliable .",
    "the use of foreground star counts requires a precise knowledge of the distribution of the stars in the direction of the cloud , and the cloud needs to be large to make the count statistically relevant .",
    "the lsr velocity of the cloud is usually influenced by local motions and can not , on its own , be used to determine the distance towards the cloud . nevertheless , to be able to obtain physical parameters from the data the correct distances need to be known . here",
    "we use the method of associating the dark clouds with larger molecular cloud complexes ( see , e.g. , launhardt & henning 1997 ) .",
    "fifteen of our clouds have distances previously reported in the literature ( hilton & lahulla 1995 ) with which our distance estimates agree very well .",
    "a discussion of the distances for the clouds presented in paper i is given in an appendix to that paper .",
    "for the larger clouds that were scan mapped details are given by visser ( 2000 ) .",
    "the assumed distances and associated cloud complexes are summarized in table  [ tab_sample ] .",
    "table  [ tab_iras ] lists the iras sources in the point source catalogue ( psc ) associated with the lynds clouds in our sample .",
    "association is defined to be all iras psc sources within the scuba maps , and the iras sources that were associated with the clouds by parker ( 1988 ) .",
    "most of the iras sources in table  [ tab_iras ] had already been associated with the lynds clouds by parker .",
    "five iras sources covered by the scuba maps were not associated by parker ( even though they sometimes satisfy parker s selection criteria , for example iras  19186 + 2325 in l771 ) , and these are marked with an `` a '' .",
    "sources associated with the cloud by parker , but not covered by the maps , are marked with a `` b '' .",

    "information about the nature of some of these iras sources is available in the literature , and is included in table  [ tab_iras ] .",
    "iras  16445@xmath151352 is probably cirrus of the type very common in @xmath2  ophiuchus , since it is only detected at 60 and 100  @xmath1 m and is extended at both wavelengths ( beichman et al .",
    "iras  16455@xmath1514051405 by bontemps et al.(1996 ) ] is listed as a class  i source by bontemps et al .",

    "this source is not covered by the scuba map , and is not discussed further .",
    "t  tauri stars covered by this survey are iras  16459@xmath151411 ( andr & montmerle 1994 ) , and iras  19181 + 1056 , which is associated with hh  32 ( curiel et al .",

    "( 1993 ) , and 16285@xmath152358 is an optically visible star ( ichikawa & nishida 1989 ) .",
    "iras  22051 + 5848 is a protostar with an outflow presented by parker , padman , & scott ( 1991 ) .",
    "launhardt , ward - thompson , & henning ( 1997 ) suggest that iras  23228 + 6320 is a protostar , but an outflow is not detected ( parker et al .",
    "massive outflows are detected from iras  21017 + 6742 ( myers et al .",
    "1988 ) and from the vicinity of 19180 + 1116 and 19180 + 1114 ( armstrong & winnewisser 1989 ) .",
    "anglada , sepulveda , & gomez ( 1997 ) argue that of these latter two it is more likely that 19180 + 1114 drives the outflow , taking into account ammonia emission , their seds , and the location of the sources with respect to the co flow .",
    "identifications from the literature are listed in column 7 of table  [ tab_iras ] .    in general , field stars and t  tauri stars",
    "are detected in the 12 and 25  @xmath1 m iras bands with their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) rising towards shorter wavelengths , while embedded protostars ( and cirrus clouds ) are detected at 60 and 100  @xmath1 m with seds rising towards longer wavelengths .",
    "this trend is seen in the sample presented in table  [ tab_iras ] , although many of the iras fluxes are high upper limits due to confusion .",
    "observations were made using the submillimeter camera , scuba , on the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii ( holland et al .",
    "scuba comprises two arrays of bolometer detectors , which can be used simultaneously by means of a dichroic beam splitter .",
    "the arrays are cooled to a temperature of 0.1  k to achieve high sensitivity .",
    "the 37 bolometers of the long - wavelength array are optimised for observations at 850  @xmath1 m , and the 91 bolometers of the short - wavelength array are optimised for operation at 450  @xmath1 m .",
    "the diffraction - limited fwhm beam sizes at these two wavelengths are @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . at 850",
    "@xmath1 m the beam is well approximated by a single gaussian , but at 450  @xmath1 m there is an extended error beam containing a roughly equal amount of power to the main diffraction beam , spread over a diameter of approximately 40@xmath18 .",
    "most of the conclusions in this paper are therefore based on the 850  @xmath1 m data .",
    "the bolometers form a hexagonal pattern , and are spaced approximately two beamwidths apart .",
    "to produce fully - sampled images , either the secondary mirror is moved in a so - called `` jiggle '' pattern , or the arrays are scanned across the sky in `` scan map '' mode .",
    "for both of these methods the secondary mirror also chops at a rate of 7.8  hz to remove most of the sky emission .",
    "the jiggle mode is ideal for sources smaller than the field of view of the arrays ( 2.3@xmath14 ) , while scan mapping is used for more extended sources .",
    "further technical details of observing with scuba on the jcmt are described by holland et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "a sample of 24 compact lynds clouds was observed in 1997 september using jiggle mode , before scan mapping was fully commissioned ( paper i ) .",
    "three larger clouds were also scan - mapped at this time as part of the commissioning of this mode ( l663 , l1165 , and l1262 ) .",
    "weather conditions were average and stable ( zenith atmospheric opacity at 850  @xmath1 m , @xmath19 = 0.2@xmath150.7 ) , but not good enough to obtain 450-@xmath1 m data .",
    "a further 15 clouds were scan mapped under extremely good weather conditions ( @xmath19 = 0.12 ) in 1998 july , providing good data at both 850 and 450  @xmath1 m .",
    "measurements at 450  @xmath1 m were also made of some of the clouds observed in 1997 during this second observing run .",
    "the total survey of 42 clouds covered an area of @xmath20 square degrees , or @xmath21",
    "pc@xmath22 for the distances listed in table  [ tab_sample ] .",
    "table  [ tab_fluxes ] indicates whether a cloud was observed in jiggle mode or scan mode .",
    "the sky transmission was monitored by performing skydips throughout each night , and the telescope pointing was checked regularly using nearby bright sources ( usually a blazar or a planet ) .",
    "the pointing accuracy was 23 arcsec .",
    "the focus and alignment of the secondary mirror were also checked two or three times every night .",
    "the absolute calibration is obtained from observations of mars and uranus , observed using the same mode and chop throw as the observations of the dark clouds .",
    "the chop throw for the jiggle maps was 150@xmath18 , with the chop direction dependent on the structure of the cloud . to remove slowly varying background emission , instrumental offsets in scuba , and telescope asymmetries ,",
    "the telescope is also nodded every 16 seconds , to place the source in the opposite beam .",
    "when mapping extended sources in scan - map mode , smaller chop throws must be used to avoid significant degredation of the beam efficiency at the edges of the arrays .",
    "in addition the telescope is not nodded , so that instrumental and other offsets have to be established during the data reduction using baselining algorithms .",
    "the resulting maps are images of the sky convolved with a dual beam function , which is the single telescope beam convolved with positive and negative delta functions separated by the chop throw ( the chop function ) .",
    "the chop function must be deconvolved from the image to obtain a representation of the sky .",
    "conceptually this deconvolution is equivalent to a division of the fourier transform ( ft ) of the image by the ft of the chop function .",
    "the ft of the chop function , however , is a sine function , and clearly problems will arise at spatial frequencies close to nulls in the sine function , where the noise will be greatly amplified by the division .",
    "there are two ways of solving the problem of noise amplification near nulls in the sine function , and both have been used here .",
    "the conventional observing method is to scan the telescope in the same direction as the chop throw ( usually azimuth ) .",
    "the resulting dual - beam map can be restored with the emerson - klein - haslam ( ekh ) algorithm ( emerson , klein , & haslam 1979 ) .",
    "the deconvolution of the chop function is essentially carried out by dividing the ft of the map with a weighted ft of the chop function , where the weighting excludes spatial frequencies which have been attenuated to less than 0.5 of their original amplitude .",
    "the scan maps obtained during commissioning of this mode were observed in this way .",
    "the other method is the `` emerson2 '' technique ( emerson 1995 ; jenness , lightfoot , & holland 1998 ) , used during the 1998 july observations . here",
    "six maps are made , three of which are chopped in right ascension , and three of which are chopped in declination .",
    "chop throws of 20@xmath18 , 30@xmath18 , and 65@xmath18 were used for each map , and the resulting spatial frequency coverage at 850 and 450  @xmath1 m is shown in figure  [ coverage ] . with the exception of the zero spatial frequency , these chop throws ensure that the nulls of the ft of each do not coincide , up to the spatial frequency limit of the telescope beam .",
    "the disadvantages of not chopping in the azimuth direction ( which gives the best subtraction of sky emission and ground spillover ) is outweighed by the improved signal - to - noise ratio due to the more efficient deconvolution of the chop function ( jenness et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the scuba user reduction facility , surf ( jenness & lightfoot 1998 ) . data from noisy or bad bolometers have been removed .",
    "details of the reduction of the jiggle maps are given by visser ( 2000 ) and paper i. for the scan maps a baseline must be removed for each scan and for each bolometer .",
    "various methods for baseline removal are provided in surf .",
    "some work better than others for a given map , but none is entirely satisfactory and baseline removal is still an unsolved problem .",
    "the chop function is then deconvolved from the data , adjoining maps are mosaicked together , and are interpolated from the coordinates of the scuba arrays to equatorial coordinates .",
    "this interpolation can result in a slight degradation of the resolution , compared with the diffraction beams given above , for both jiggle maps and scan maps .",
    "the effective resolution at 850  @xmath1 m is @xmath23 .    the incomplete spatial frequency coverage for scan maps ( figure  [ coverage ] ) results in the low spatial frequencies ( corresponding to large - scale structure in the image ) being measured with low sensitivity , and the zero spatial frequency ( i.e. , the total power in the map ) not being measured at all .",
    "the deconvolution of the chop function is therefore similar in many respects to the deconvolution of the dirty beam from an image made by an interferometer , where an attempt is made to extrapolate the measured visibility function to zero spatial frequency while maintaining consistency with the measured data . in the emerson2 algorithm",
    "as implemented in surf the effect is to amplify the noise on low spatial frequencies , so that the final images have the equivalent of ` 1/f ' noise in the image plane : spatial scales corresponding to a few chop throws or more are measured with low sensitivity and thus have high noise values , whereas structures on scales between the maximum chop throw and the beam size are measured with dynamic ranges limited only by the thermal noise .",
    "the 24 compact lynds clouds observed using scuba in jiggle mode have been presented in paper i and will not be reproduced here .",
    "the 15 clouds detected in scan map mode are shown in figures  [ fig_l57 ] to [ fig_l1709 ] .",
    "contour plots of the 850-@xmath1 m or 450-@xmath1 m continuum emission are overlaid on optical images from the stsci digitized sky survey , with contour levels indicated in the figure captions .",
    "all the images have been smoothed with a 20@xmath18 gaussian ( fwhm ) , apart from those of l158 and l1172 ( figures  [ fig_l158 ] and [ fig_l1172 ] ) , for which a 25@xmath18 gaussian was used .",
    "this smoothing improves the signal - to - noise ratio in the maps , and brings out the faint , extended structure .",
    "the smoothing also suppresses high spatial frequency noise introduced by the data reduction process .",
    "the area of each cloud surveyed is outlined by a dashed line .",
    "eight clouds from the total of 42 were not detected , 5 in jiggle mode and 3 in scan map mode .",
    "further details of these non - detections , including the areas covered by the scuba maps of these clouds , are given by visser ( 2000 ) .",
    "the positions of sources from the iras psc are indicated by triangles in each image .",
    "the optical shapes of the clouds in this sample are varied .",
    "the clouds l57 , l543 , l663 , and l675 are round and globule - like .",
    "the clouds l860 , l951 , and l1103 appear to have been swept up by a shock or wind , and are cometary - like .",
    "the structure of l673 , on the other hand , is very filamentary .",
    "the submillimeter continuum emission also encompasses a wide range of structures . of the clouds that were detected ,",
    "some exhibit purely diffuse , extended emission , some contain compact submillimeter sources , and others , such as l63 , l694 , and l944 , have a combination of both . the extended submillimeter emission from l31 and l953 correlates",
    "very well with extinction in the optical images .    the extended submillimeter emission from a few clouds does not correlate well with the dust extinction : see , for instance , l162 , and the southern part of l673 . in the case of l673 this might be caused by poor atmospheric conditions during observation of the southern part .",
    "this would increase the noise level towards the south , and may also explain why 450-@xmath1 m emission is only detected towards the northern parts of the cloud .",
    "the lowest contour levels in the south may therefore trace correlated noise and is not very reliable .",
    "l162 was also observed under less than optimum weather conditions . in general , scan maps",
    "can sometimes exhibit not only suspicious extended positive features , but also negative features ",
    "artifacts introduced by the deconvolution process and the lack of information at low spatial frequencies .",
    "several techniques have been used in the literature to solve this problem , such as fitting two - dimensional polynomials or surfaces to background emission in the image plane ( e.g. , johnstone & bally 1999 ; bianchi et al .",
    "such methods are , however , ad hoc , and no such subtraction has been performed on the images presented in figures  [ fig_l57 ] to [ fig_l1709 ] .",
    "unsatisfactory as this may be , uncertainty in the structure of extended features in these images will not affect the identification of compact objects such as protostars and starless cores .",
    "the peak flux densities in the unsmoothed maps are listed in table  [ tab_fluxes ] for both observed wavelengths . the peak position in the 850-@xmath1 m map of a cloud",
    "does not necessarily coincide with the peak position in the 450-@xmath1 m image ( see , e.g. , l63 in figure  [ fig_l63 ] ) . for those scan maps exhibiting negative features",
    "the peak fluxes have been measured from a local zero level , determined from cuts through the peak of the emission .",
    "this increased the peak flux densities of 10 sources by @xmath24% .",
    "the total systematic error in the 450 and 850-@xmath1 m peak flux densities is about 50% and 20% respectively , and is due to negative features and fluctuations in the optical depth of the atmosphere .",
    "also presented in table  [ tab_fluxes ] are the statistical uncertainties and integrated flux densities for extended emission .",
    "the typical noise level in a 850-@xmath1 m map is 25  mjy  beam@xmath25 .",
    "the noise levels on the 850-@xmath1 m ekh maps of l663 , l1165 , and l1262 are considerably higher , however , due to the poor weather conditions .",
    "the integrated flux densities were obtained by summing the flux density within a box around the extended emission of the cloud .",
    "the box sizes varied depending on the size of the clouds , but the boxes always covered the extended emission down to the 1@xmath26 detection limit , staying clear of the noisy edges of the maps .",
    "no correction has been made for the ( potentially spurious ) negative or positive features in the scan maps when measuring the integrated flux densities .",
    "the 850-@xmath1 m peak flux densities have been used to calculate masses , column densities , space densities and extinction , @xmath27 , and are presented in table  [ tab_fluxes ] . assuming low optical depth at 850  @xmath1 m the total mass ( gas plus dust ) traced by the submillimeter dust emission is found from @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the distance to the source , @xmath30 is the flux density at frequency @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the planck function for dust temperature @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the dust opacity per unit mass of gas plus dust . for @xmath35",
    "m@xmath22  kg@xmath25 , and a temperature @xmath36  k , this gives @xmath37(mjy  beam@xmath25 ) ) .",
    "the peak masses obtained in this way range from 0.04  @xmath38 to 4.07  @xmath38 .",
    "the column density has been calculated using @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mass of an h@xmath41 molecule , @xmath1 is the mean molecular weight of the particles , assumed to be 1.36 , and @xmath42 is the solid angle of the beam . for the same values of @xmath43 and @xmath33 used above , and @xmath44 ,",
    "this reduces to @xmath45(mjy  beam@xmath25 ) ) .",
    "an estimate of the mean space density is obtained by assuming the depth of the cloud is similar to the beamsize at the distance of the cloud .",
    "the mean peak column density is @xmath46  m@xmath47 , and the mean peak density is @xmath48  m@xmath49 , but the values for individual clouds cover a broad range .",
    "the peak extinction is calculated using @xmath50 ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) , and for the detected clouds all have @xmath51  mag , agreeing well with that measured for dark clouds using isotopomers of co ( myers , linke , & benson 1983 ) . the total gas mass and mean column densities",
    "are also presented in table  [ tab_fluxes ] , calculated using the integrated flux densities .",
    "the total mass observed in the survey is @xmath52 , with the most mass ( @xmath53 ) associated with l673 .",
    "the mean cloud column density varies between @xmath54 and @xmath55  m@xmath47 with three exceptions : l663 , l1165 , and l1262 .",
    "these three clouds were those observed with the ekh technique , and the dynamic range on these maps is too small to be able to detect the lower column densities .",
    "it is clear that the above calculations of mass , column , and space densities depend on the assumptions made about the dust opacity , dust temperature , and distance of the cloud .",
    "the dust opacity used is that of hildebrand ( 1983 ) , and is probably uncertain by a factor of 3 or so ( henning , michel , & stognienko 1995 ) .",
    "the assumed dust temperature of 12  k is typical for quiescent , dark , molecular clouds ( myers et al.1983 ) , but is likely to be an underestimate for those clouds containing young stellar objects .",
    "radiation from protostars heat the surrounding material out to @xmath6  au ( chandler & richer 2000 ) , and protostellar outflows can also heat the cloud through shocks .",
    "however , temperatures in the range 8  k to 20  k will not change the derived cloud masses by more than a factor of two .",
    "uncertainties in the cloud distances potentially have a stronger influence on the cloud mass .",
    "the numbers presented in table  [ tab_fluxes ] should therefore be regarded just as indicative of general cloud conditions .",
    "the submillimeter images of the 42 lynds clouds presented in section  [ sec_images ] and paper i show many compact objects , possibly pre - protostellar or protostellar in nature .",
    "a compact object not containing a protostar is not necessarily pre - protostellar , however .",
    "a dense core must be gravitationally bound before it can collapse and form a star , and it is not possible to determine whether a clump is gravitationally bound from dust emission alone .",
    "the term `` starless core '' is therefore used here to denote a compact source not associated with an outflow .    various definitions of a `` core '' can also be found in the literature .",
    "myers et al .  (",
    "1983 ) were the first to study cores in dark molecular clouds systematically , and defined a core as a small ( 0.1  pc ) , dense ( @xmath56  m@xmath49 ) and cold ( 10  k ) condensation which is close to stable equilibrium and _ may _ evolve into a low - mass star .",
    "williams et al .",
    "( 2000 ) define a core as a region in which a single star ( or multiple system such as a binary ) forms and which is gravitationally bound .",
    "here we use the term core to refer to the compact submillimeter objects in the scuba survey , which are not necessarily gravitationally bound .",
    "compact submillimeter objects in the lynds clouds ( smm ) have been identified by spatially filtering the scuba images .",
    "each map was smoothed with a 2@xmath14 gaussian , and the smoothed map was then subtracted from the original image .",
    "this removed all large cloud structures , as well as the unreliable positive and negative features resulting from the beam deconvolution of the scan maps .",
    "the remaining image contains only compact structures , and all structures at a level @xmath57 were identified as cores .",
    "although this method is somewhat subjective , it does select in a quantitative way all the features seen by eye , and all known protostars and pre - protostellar cores .",
    "ideally , one would like to use a fixed physical scale ( such as a limiting @xmath27 ) to select the dense cores .",
    "however , this fixed value would be dominated by the noisiest map .",
    "forty smm cores were identified in the manner described above , and are listed in table  [ tab_cores ] .",
    "the positions of the cores have been obtained from gaussian fits to the emission , and so do not necessarily coincide exactly with the emission peak .",
    "four cores were rejected from the list ( in l31 , l55 , and two in l917 ) , since they appear near the edge of the map where spiky negative and positive features can occur , a known artifact resulting from the regridding algorithm .",
    "l158@xmath15smm2 is suspiciously spiky too , but since it is not near the edge of the map it is included in the list .",
    "there are 10 cores that lie within 12@xmath18 of sources in the iras psc , and so can be directly associated with those sources .",
    "these associations are listed in table  [ tab_cores ] .",
    "all 10 cores are known protostars .",
    "both l673@xmath15smm1 and l1709@xmath15smm5 lie within 40@xmath18 of an iras source ( 19180 + 1116 and 16285@xmath152356 respectively ) , and are possible associations . in order to verify these possible assocations , hires images of the iras data for l673 and l1709 were obtained from ipac .",
    "figures  [ l673_hires ] and [ l1709_hires ] demonstrate that iras  19180 + 1116 can confidently be associated with l673@xmath15smm1 , and iras  16285@xmath152356 with l1709@xmath15smm5 .",
    "figure  [ fig_cores ] shows 850  @xmath1 m emission from all the cores in the sample on the same angular scale , with the central positions from table  [ tab_cores ] marked as stars .",
    "all associated iras sources are very near the core positions , apart from iras  19180 + 1116 and 16285@xmath152356 .",
    "some of the cores are very compact and round ( see , e.g. , l260@xmath15smm1 , l673@xmath15smm1 , and l1262@xmath15smm1 ) , while others are more extended ( e.g. , l63@xmath15smm1 , l158@xmath15smm1 , and l673@xmath15smm8 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that emission from t  tauri stars and class  i sources is more centrally condensed than emission from class  0 sources ( andr & montmerle 1994 ) .",
    "certainly , the only t  tauri star detected , l162@xmath15smm1 , is very compact , as expected .",
    "l63@xmath15smm1 , a starless core , appears extended , and the known protostars vary from compact ( l483@xmath15smm1 ) to very compact ( l1709@xmath15smm1 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig673_cores ] and [ fig1709_cores ] illustrate the locations of the submillimeter cores in l673 and l1709 , the two clouds containing multiple sources .",
    "the detection limit in terms of mass is different for each cloud , due to varying noise levels and distances . in order to establish that we have complete ( or at least , representative ) samples of starless cores , class  0 , and class  i sources down to a certain mass limit",
    ", we must consider each of these effects .",
    "starless cores and class  0 sources are easier to detect than class  i sources at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "class  0 sources ( for which the envelope mass , @xmath58 , is greater than the mass of the forming protostar , @xmath59 ) have more material in their envelopes than class  i sources ( for which @xmath60 ) , and starless , pre - protostellar objects still have _ all _ their material in an `` envelope '' , since they have not yet formed a hydrostatic protostellar core .",
    "our main problem is therefore potentially missing class  i sources associated with the observed lynds clouds .    in section  [ stats ]",
    "we compare the detection rates of class  0 and class  i sources in our sample with those previously observed for @xmath2  ophiuchus by andr & montmerle ( 1994 ) , for which the detected ratio of class  0 sources to class  i was 1:10 . in order for such a comparison to be meaningful ,",
    "it is important to establish whether our samples of class  i protostars meet the same completeness criteria .",
    "andr & montmerle found that , for class  i sources in @xmath2  ophiuchus , @xmath58 ranges from @xmath61 to @xmath62 with a median value of @xmath63 , assuming a dust temperature of 30  k , and @xmath64  m@xmath65  kg@xmath25 .",
    "the detection mass limit for the lynds clouds mapped using scuba can be calculated using these same parameters , adopting a @xmath66 flux detection limit , the distances given in table  [ tab_sample ] , and scaling @xmath67 to a wavelength of 850  @xmath1 m assuming a frequency dependent dust opacity , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "the detection limit for most clouds is then @xmath70 in our survey . only the furthest clouds ( l543 , l771 , l860 , l917 , l944 , l951 , l953 , l1172 , l1246 ) , and the clouds for which the maps are noisy ( l663 , l1165 , l1262 ) , have higher mass detection limits , ranging from @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "we could , therefore , have missed some class  i sources in these clouds .",
    "however , we would still have expected these sources to have been detected by iras : even for the most distant cloud its 60  @xmath1 m detection limit of 0.25  jy is equivalent to @xmath73 .    in total",
    "there are nine iras sources associated with the clouds mentioned above ( table  [ tab_iras ] ) , and five of these sources are known protostars which we have detected .",
    "we do , therefore , need to investigate the nature of the remaining four iras sources , in order to exclude the possibility that these are low - mass class  i protostars , undetected in the scuba maps",
    ". the iras colors of 22051 + 5849 in l1165 do not correspond to those of a protostar , and this is certainly not a class  i source .",
    "two iras sources not detected as submillimeter cores , 19343 + 0727 in l663 and",
    "19186 + 2325 in l771 , do have the colors consistent with being protostellar , but these sources can be identified with bright , optically - visible stars .",
    "the remaining undetected iras source is 21186 + 4320 , a source with an entry in the psc at only 100  @xmath1 m .",
    "a hires 60-@xmath1 m image of this cloud showed far - infrared emission displaced from the psc position , and the 60  @xmath1 m peak in the hires map was not covered by the scuba image .",
    "none of the undetected iras sources is therefore a class  i source , and our sample of submillimeter cores should be complete for class  i sources down to @xmath74 .",
    "to determine the nature of the newly - identified compact cores a search for outflows was carried out in the j=21 transition of @xmath75co ( 230.538  ghz ) using receiver a2 on the jcmt .",
    "observations were made in 1998 july , and by jcmt staff in service mode throughout 1999 .",
    "spectra were obtained in a five- or nine - point pattern , with the central spectrum on the dust peak from the scuba 850-@xmath1 m map .",
    "the system temperature was typically 440  k and the integration time of each spectrum was 2 minutes , to give an rms level of 0.2  k in a bandwidth of 0.16  mhz ( 0.2  km  s@xmath25 ) .",
    "table  [ tab_cores ] shows which submillimeter cores have been searched for outflows , and whether or not high - velocity gas was detected .",
    "ten cores were not observed in @xmath75co(21 ) : l483@xmath15smm1 is a well known protostar whose outflow has already been extensively studied ; l162@xmath15smm1 is a t  tauri star , and l158@xmath15smm2 is the unreliable `` spiky '' source .",
    "the other seven cores were not searched due to limited observing time , but seem extended and are unlikely to contain embedded protostars ( figure  [ fig_cores ] ) .",
    "they have therefore been classified as `` probably starless '' cores since , strictly speaking , their nature is still unidentified . of the 40 cores identified in section  [ sec_cores ]",
    "ten are known protostars , 8 of which were already known to drive outflows .",
    "the two protostars for which this was not known are l162@xmath15smm1 ( a class  ii object ) , and l1246@xmath15smm1 ( which does show high - velocity line wings in these new data ) . of the 30 remaining cores , 22 were searched for high - velocity gas , and the @xmath75co(21 ) line emission from three of these cores ( l673@xmath15smm1 , l944@xmath15smm1 , and l1709@xmath15smm5 ) shows high - velocity emission , indicative of an outflow .",
    "larger maps of the three new outflows , and seven of the known 8 flows ( all but l483@xmath15smm1 ) , were subsequently observed in @xmath75co(21 ) in 1998 july and throughout 1999 in service mode with receiver a2 on the jcmt .",
    "many of the old maps of the known outflows are incomplete , of poor resolution , or not in @xmath75co(21 ) , and our new observations provide a homogeneous sample .",

    "the spectra were taken by position - switching to eliminate instrumental and atmospheric effects .",
    "pointing was checked regularly and the system was calibrated using standard chopper wheel techniques to obtain spectra on the @xmath76 scale . the main beam efficiency at this wavelength is 0.66 .",

    "1996 ) , and also has been identified optically ( ichikawa & nishida 1989 ) .",
    "optical identifications are rare for class  i sources , and this fact , together with the detection of only a very compact and weak outflow , suggest that this protostar is either fairly evolved and accreting the last of its material , or is being observed close to pole - on ( figure  [ fig_260outflow ] ) .",

    "the detection of the outflow from l483@xmath15smm1 in @xmath75co @xmath77=43 by hatchell , fuller , & ladd ( 1999 ) confirms the presence of heated gas , and the dust emission probably traces this same material .",

    "the ratio @xmath98 will increase with age , as material from the envelope is accreted onto the protostar .",
    "andr et al .",
    "classify protostars as class  0 when @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is measured from 1 to 1300  @xmath1 m , and @xmath102 is the submillimeter luminosity from 350 to 1300  @xmath1 m .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath101 can not be determined without near - infrared measurements , and the best we can do here is to calculate the luminosity from 12 to 1300  @xmath1 m .",
    "this will underestimate @xmath101 , particularly for the older sources .",
    "lower limits to @xmath101 have therefore been calculated by integrating under the greybody fit from 1300 to 150  @xmath1 m , and by regarding the iras psc or hires upper limits as real detections .",
    "this latter assumption may tend to overestimate @xmath101 , and figure  [ fig_seds ] shows it will affect mainly those protostars not detected by iras at 12  @xmath1 m . for both l663@xmath15smm1 and l944@xmath15smm1 , which are not detected at either 12 or 25  @xmath1 m , the bolometric luminosity has been calculated by integrating under the greybody fit only .",
    "estimates of @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are listed in table  [ tab_proto ] . applying the criterion that a protostar is a class  0 source when @xmath104 results in only one class  i source in this sample , suggesting that a different limit should be used for a sample that does not include near - infrared emission in determining @xmath101 .",
    "indeed , a limit of @xmath105 is needed to reproduce most of the classifications of those protostars with previous measurements or good upper limits in the near- and mid - infrared .",
    "the only source which then does not match its previous classification is l483@xmath15smm1 , which has recently been described as a transition class  0/class  i object by tafalla et al .",
    "( 2000 ) based on a study of the emission from various molecular species .",

    "l162@xmath15smm1 has a @xmath91 considerably lower than the 650  k limit assigned by chen et al . , but this source is also likely to be the most seriously affected by the lack of near - infrared data included in its sed .",
    "a class  0/class  i boundary at @xmath109  k gives reasonably good agreement with previous classifications for the other protostars .",
    "the class implied for l1709@xmath15smm5 obtained from its @xmath91 is not consistent with that implied by its @xmath98 , and this source may be a transition object similar to l483@xmath15smm1 .",

    "( 1996 ) also find that outflows from class  0 protostars are more efficient than those from class  i protostars , when @xmath122 is compared to the maximum momentum flux available in stellar photons , @xmath128 .",
    "the outflow efficiency , given by the ratio @xmath129 , is listed in table  [ tab_proto ] for the ten outflow sources mapped and this trend is clearly evident : the class  0 sources typically have @xmath130 . table  [ tab_proto ] also illustrates the nature of l1709@xmath15smm5 as an object in transition between class  0 and class  i. l1246@xmath15smm1 again stands out as having an outflow considerably weaker than other class  0 sources .",
    "the outflow efficiency scales as @xmath131 , so an overestimated distance might again help bring this source into line with the others in this sample .",

    "if it were close enough to raise its outflow efficiency by the factor of 4 or 5 needed to bring it in line with to the bontemps et al.correlation it would have to be rather isolated .",
    "the emission from the class  0 sources is extended , and some objects , such as l483@xmath15smm1 , clearly exhibit structure related to the outflow .",
    "all the sources identified as class  i protostars in table  [ tab_proto ] are unresolved apart from l1709@xmath15smm5 .",
    "l1709@xmath15smm5 stands out among all the cores identified as protostellar in nature as being the most extended , and in many respects resembles the starless cores .",
    "this raises the possibility that l1709@xmath15smm5 in fact comprises several sources in superposition along the line of sight .",
    "higher resolution observations are needed to confirm this idea .",
    "the masses , column densities and inferred space densities of those cores not containing embedded protostars are listed in table  [ tab_starless ] , along with the protostar candidate l673@xmath15smm3 .",
    "the integrated flux densities at 850  @xmath1 m have been measured within an aperture after the subtraction of background emission as described in section  [ sec_core_id ] .",
    "for some of the more extended cores , such as l260@xmath15smm2 , the subtraction of background emission may subtract extended emission from the core itself . however , in most cases the background subtraction is clearly desirable , in order to obtain integrated flux densities representing only the compact submillimeter core .",
    "the size of the aperture used was determined from radially - averaged intensity profiles , after background subtraction , to include all the observed emission .",
    "table  [ tab_starless ] gives the diameter of the aperture used for each core .",
    "the masses were calculated assuming @xmath132  k and @xmath133  m@xmath22  kg@xmath25 .",
    "the space densities assume that the core has a depth along the line of sight the same as the aperture diameter . the mean mass of the cores is 1.1  @xmath38 , the mean column density @xmath134  m@xmath47 , and the mean space density @xmath135  m@xmath49 .",
    "the masses of the starless cores are systematically higher than those of the protostellar envelopes , by approximately 0.6  @xmath38 .",
    "if the starless cores are indeed the progenitors of the protostars in this sample , we might therefore expect that the starless cores will , in time , produce stars of @xmath201  @xmath38 .",
    "this result must be taken with some caution , since different dust opacities and dust temperatures have been used for calculating the masses for each population , in such a way that these two factors both serve to increase the apparent mass of the starless cores . however , the assumption that the temperatures in the protostellar envelopes are higher than those in the starless cores is probably a good one , and even if the same dust opacity were used for all sources the starless cores would still be more massive than the protostellar envelopes .    the 26 starless cores in table  [ tab_starless ] represent the largest sample of these objects for which submillimeter continuum images have been made to date , and therefore provide a unique dataset with which to study the properties of these objects . in particular ,",
    "if the cores are isothermal , the radial intensity profile of the submillimeter emission can be directly inverted to determine the radial density profile in the cores .",
    "analytic and numerical studies show that the mass infall rate during the protostellar phase depends on the radial density profile at the onset of collapse , and on the equation of state of the material .",
    "singular models have an @xmath136 density profile resulting in a constant accretion rate ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "density profiles with a flatter inner region , however , will result in a high mass - infall rate initially , possibly corresponding to the class  0 phase , followed by a phase with a low accretion rate , possibly corresponding to the class  i phase ( foster & chevalier 1993 ; henriksen , andr , & bontemps 1997 ) .",
    "the evolution of a protostar will also depend on whether the core from which it is forming has an `` edge . ''",
    "the shu picture has star formation taking place in an essentially infinite reservoir of material , in which case the final mass of the star being formed will be determined by a local process , such as the interaction between its outflow and accretion .",
    "if , however , the core has a well - defined edge , the final stellar mass may determined by the structure of the core in the pre - collapse phase .",
    "the starless cores that have been studied to date in millimeter / submillimeter continuum emission do not appear to show the @xmath137 density profile predicted by the singular isothermal model of shu ( 1977 ) .",
    "instead , they have shallow density profiles in their inner regions , in qualitative agreement with models of magnetically - supported cloud cores ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "1994 ; andr , ward - thompson , & motte 1996 ; motte , andr , & neri 1998 ; ward - thompson et al .  1999 ; shirley et al .",
    "the density profiles of a number of starless cores have also been studied in absorption in the mid - infrared ( bacmann et al .",
    "these also exhibit density profiles that flatten toward the center , and several also have sharp edges .",
    "such profiles need very strong background magnetic fields to be supported , but they are also well - fitted by bonnor - ebert - type hydrostatic equilibrium models for isothermal , self - gravitating , cores confined by external pressure .",
    "radial intensity profiles for all the starless cores in our sample were obtained from the scuba 850-@xmath1 m images by averaging data points in a 3@xmath18 wide ring at radius @xmath138 from the core center ( table  [ tab_cores ] ) , from @xmath139 to 450@xmath18 or the edge of the map .",
    "the mean ellipticity of the starless cores is 1.5 , and the assumption of circular symmetry should therefore result in a representative intensity profile ( see also andr et al .",
    "1996 ) , although there is clearly scope for more detailed modelling .",
    "eighteen of the cores have had dc offsets subtracted to obtain sensible zero levels for the background .",
    "emission from nearby cores or protostars were not removed before the profile fitting . a single power - law model for the density distribution did not fit most of the starless cores , so the intensity profiles have been modeled with a density distribution consisting of two power laws .",
    "the density is assumed to have the form @xmath140 from @xmath141  au to a radius @xmath142 , beyond which @xmath143 .",
    "the density at @xmath144  au was assumed to be zero to avoid any singularity .",
    "an outer cutoff radius @xmath145 has also been implemented to model the observed edge of the profile .",
    "a temperature @xmath146  k has been assumed , and dust opacity @xmath147  m@xmath22  kg@xmath25 .",
    "the resulting intensity profile was calculated from the model by integrating the density distribution along the line of sight , and convolving it with a 15@xmath18 gaussian to simulate the jcmt beam at 850  @xmath1 m .",
    "the four parameters @xmath142 , @xmath145 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 were then adjusted to produce the best fit .",
    "the density at @xmath142 , @xmath150 , was normalized to reproduce the observed flux density .",
    "profiles of all the starless cores were fitted except for l158@xmath15smm2 , which is a suspected artifact of the regridding algorithm ( secton  [ sec_core_id ] ) , and l1709@xmath15smm4 , which is an extended ridge and clearly should not be modelled by a spherically - symmetric core ( figure  [ fig_cores ] ) .",
    "all the fitted cores apart from l673@xmath15smm6 and l951@xmath15smm2 show a flat inner part in the intensity profile , with a steepening in the radial power - law exponent beyond @xmath142 , out to @xmath145 where the intensity profile merges into the background . excluding these two cores we find mean values of @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "figure  [ fig_profiles ] shows one of the best fits , l694@xmath15smm1 , an average fit , l1262@xmath15smm2 , and a very poor fit , l673@xmath15smm7 .",
    "the parameters of these fits are also given in table  [ tab_starless ] .",
    "for none of our cores is the radial density profile steeper than @xmath153 , as was found for three starless cores by bacmann et al .  ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , the best - fit values of @xmath149 are positively correlated with values of @xmath145 in our fitting , so that a larger value of @xmath149 can , to some extent , be compensated for by a larger value of @xmath145 .    both the results presented here and previous work seem to rule out the singular isothermal spheres developed by shu and coworkers ( but see also the recent , more detailed , modeling of starless cores by evans et al.2001 ) , and the logotropic model having @xmath154 at large radii proposed by mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1997 ) , as the pre - collapse density profile of starless cores . instead",
    ", the radial density profiles resemble more closely those expected for pressure - bounded - ebert spheres ( e.g. , foster & chevalier 1993 ) or for which magnetic pressure is important ( e.g. , ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ; basu & mouschovias 1995 ) .",
    "assuming star formation is a homogeneous process in our sample of dark clouds , and that the starless cores @xmath155 class  0 sources @xmath155 class  i protostars represent an evolutionary sequence , statistical lifetimes of these different stages can be derived from the relative numbers of objects in these different phases .",
    "we find a total of 7 class  0 sources , 5 class  i sources , one candidate protostar , and 26 starless cores .",
    "all these cores and protostars are observed in 21 clouds , i.e. , in half of the sample of optically - dark molecular clouds .",
    "fifty percent of the clouds are therefore quiescent .",
    "one of the most remarkable results of this survey is that the ratio of class  0 sources to class  i sources is not 1 to 10 , as has been observed in previous surveys of the @xmath2 ophiuchi main cloud ( andr & montmerle 1994 ; motte et al .",
    "1998 ) , which are also believed to be complete . furthermore",
    ", this result comes in spite of the fact that a significant fraction of the cores in our sample are associated with the @xmath2 ophiuchi complex . separating our sample into those clouds that are associated with @xmath2 ophiuchus and those that are not results in rather small numbers , but the comparison is nevertheless worth investigating . for the lynds clouds associated with @xmath2 ophiuchus ( see table  [ tab_sample ] )",
    "we find 3 class  i protostars , 1 class  ii source , and 10 starless cores , giving a class  0 to class  i ratio consistent with earlier results . for the non-@xmath2 ophiuchi clouds we find 7 class  0",
    "sources , 2 class  i sources , and 17 starless cores . excluding the clouds in @xmath2 ophiuchus",
    "therefore makes the potential ratio of class  0 to class  i sources even higher .",
    "we have considered whether the discrepancy between the ratio of class  0 to class  i sources observed in lynds dark clouds compared with that observed for @xmath2 ophiuchus is the result of the completeness limit of our sample ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "if , for example , the lynds clouds form predominantly lower - mass stars than does @xmath2 ophiuchus , then our mass completeness limit would be insufficient to detect all the class  i sources associated with the lynds clouds . in order for such an effect to account for the observed discrepancy , approximately 90% of the class  i sources in the lynds clouds would have to have @xmath156 .",
    "in a recent study of embedded protostars in the low - mass , star - forming region of taurus , motte & andr ( 2001 ) found that in a total of 23 class  i sources only 5 have @xmath157 .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that our completeness limit can account for the discrepancy , unless star formation in the lynds clouds proceeds very differently from star formation in both taurus and @xmath2 ophiuchus .",
    "while there are difficulties in the classification of some of our objects ( section  [ sec_protostars ] ) , we can fairly easily rule out a 1:10 ratio for the full sample , and the statistics are more consistent with a 1:1 ratio .",
    "this suggests that the lifetime of a class  0 source in a lynds dark cloud is as long as the lifetime of a class  i source , a result that is supported by the dynamical lifetimes of the outflows .",
    "the mean dynamical age of the class  0 outflows presented here is @xmath158  yr , compared with the class  i outflows , of @xmath159  yr . even if the dynamical lifetime of the outflow in l1246 is overestimated due to the uncertainty in its distance , the mean age of the remaining class  0 outflows is @xmath160  yr , similar to that measured for the class  i sources .",
    "the lifetime of the class  i phase is believed to be reasonably well established due to complete infrared surveys of the @xmath2 ophiuchus and taurus star forming regions ( wilking , lada , & young 1989 ; kenyon et al .",
    "if a lifetime of @xmath3  yr is adopted for class  i protostars , the statistical lifetime of class  0 sources in this sample will be similar .",
    "of course , this assumes that stars form in molecular clouds continuously and in a homogeneous fashion .",
    "however , the different ratio of the numbers of class  0 to class  i sources found here , compared with other surveys , might indicate that stars do not form in such a homogeneous way , demonstrating that the star formation process is highly dependent on the local environment .",
    "there are three ways this might work :    * class  0 sources may represent a different branch of star formation , and may not be precursors of class  i sources .",
    "indeed , jayawardhana , hartmann , & calvet ( 2001 ) have suggested that some class  0 sources may be protostars forming in very high density regions , and are in fact at the same evolutionary stage as the class  i sources forming in lower density environments . if this were true , however , it would imply that the lynds dark clouds are of higher density than the cores in @xmath2 ophiuchus .",
    "a comparison of our results with those of motte et al.(1998 ) shows the opposite to be the case . *",
    "if class  0 sources are precursors to class  i sources , it may be that the environment , with its local initial conditions , determines how long the class  0 phase lasts .",
    "for example , if the lynds clouds represent a more quiescent environment than the clouds in @xmath2 ophiuchus , there may be more time for the starless cores in the lynds clouds to evolve towards a singular isothermal sphere before the onset of collapse . in this case",
    "the collapse might progress with a constant accretion rate , and the class  0 phase could then last longer in these clouds . in @xmath2",
    "ophiuchus the star formation may be triggered before the starless cores reach a singular state , in which case a more dramatic class  0 phase ( higher accretion rates ) would precede the class  i phase .",
    "however , none of the starless cores detected here has the characteristics of a singular isothermal sphere on small scales . *",
    "perhaps a more likely possibility is that star formation is not a steady process .",
    "if star formation relies heavily on triggering , the sample of embedded protostars in @xmath2 ophiuchus may be dominated by an older , more evolved population due to a burst of star formation some @xmath4  yr ago . indeed , on large scales it is thought that star formation in @xmath2 ophuichus may have been triggered by a supernova in the scorpio - centaurus ob association ( de geus 1992 ) .",
    "motte et al.(1998 ) conclude that the small - scale structure of the @xmath2 ophiuchi main cloud is also consistent with the passage of a shock , and that the youth of the protostars over a large region indicate star formation must have been synchronized by an external mechanism .",
    "the previous , short , lifetimes derived for class  0 protostars in @xmath2 ophiuchus also had another important implication for accretion during early protostellar evolution .",
    "a distinguishing feature of class  0 protostars is that they are surrounded by a considerably larger reservoir of circumstellar material than class  i protostars ( see , e.g. , table  [ tab_proto ] ) , and a short time spent in this phase implied a considerably higher accretion rate for class  0 protostars compared with the class  i phase . if , instead , protostars spend a similar amount of time in the class  0 and class  i phases , there may be no such initial period of rapid accretion .",
    "there are 26 starless cores compared with a total of 12 or 13 embedded protostars in our sample of lynds clouds , so the ratio is approximately 2:1 .",
    "this suggests that the lifetime of a starless core as detected in the scuba survey is only twice as long as the lifetime of an embedded protostar .",
    "the lifetime of the class  0 and class",
    "i phase combined is @xmath161  yr , and from this the estimated lifetime of starless cores is @xmath162  yr .",
    "this is only 23 times the free - fall time for an average core in the sample , @xmath163  yr . using the power - law density profiles given in table  [ tab_starless ] we have examined whether the thermal pressure of gas at a temperature of 1012  k is sufficient to provide support against gravitational collapse for the starless cores on scales @xmath164  au . in all cases a velocity dispersion of @xmath1650.2  km  s@xmath25",
    "is required , comparable to the isothermal sound speed for gas at 10  k. it therefore seems entirely feasible that the starless cores are in hydrostatic equilibrium and do not need the support of magnetic fields _ on these size scales_. the cores are , therefore , on the verge of collapse , and it is unlikely that strong magnetic fields are important for the collapse dynamics of starless cores once they reach densities of @xmath166  m@xmath49 .",
    "of course , this does not rule out the possibility that magnetic fields are important for providing support in molecular clouds on larger size scales , nor does it suggest that magnetic fields may not be important dynamically for the _ formation _ of the starless cores .",
    "since all the compact cores are observed in half the sample of dark clouds the other half of the sample are quiescent clouds .",
    "the combined duration of the starless core phase and embedded phase is @xmath167  yr , and the statistical lifetime of a quiescent lynds class 6 cloud is thus also @xmath167  yr . the comparison made here is , however , difficult , since all the clouds have different sizes , and some of the clouds are complexes of smaller clouds ( e.g. , l673 ) .",
    "nevertheless , these clouds are known to have reasonably long lifetimes and should at least be stable for long enough to form stars .",
    "some t  tauri stars are also still found in this type of cloud , suggesting that the clouds have lifetimes @xmath168  yr .",
    "we have surveyed a sample of optically - selected dark clouds for the submillimeter dust emission associated with embedded protostars and starless dense cores .",
    "the optical selection criterion is equivalent to a limiting column density ( @xmath12 mag ) , and avoids biases relating to the infrared properties of older protostars and other indicators of star formation potential or activity .",
    "furthermore , the clouds are predominantly nearby , giving a sample for which good spatial resolution can be obtained .",
    "all clouds were imaged at @xmath169  @xmath1 m , with a spatial resolution of @xmath17010,000  au , depending on the distance . a total of 42 dark clouds , covering an area of 0.5 square degrees ,",
    "are included in the survey .",
    "compact submillimeter cores have been identified in the clouds , and we have established whether the cores contain embedded protostars through a combination of association with iras emission and/or the presence of high - velocity co(21 ) emission from protostellar outflows .",
    "the survey is complete for starless cores , and for class  0 and class  i protostars , to a mass limit of 0.015  @xmath38 .",
    "half of the clouds , 21 in total , do not contain any compact submillimeter cores , and are therefore quiescent as far as star formation activity is concerned .",
    "the other half contain a total of 7 class  0 protostars , 5 class  i protostars , one class  ii source , a candidate protostar ( l673@xmath15smm3 ) , and 26 starless cores . the ratio of class  0 to class  i protostars found in this survey is therefore close to unity , and is not consistent with the previous result found for the @xmath2 ophiuchi cloud , where a ratio of 1 to 10 has been observed ( andr & montmerle 1994 ; motte et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the ratio of starless cores to cores containing embedded protostars is approximately 2 to 1 .",
    "the implied lifetimes of the class  0 and starless core phases are therefore @xmath171  yr and @xmath162  yr respectively .",
    "the different ratio of class  0 to class  i protostars detected in our survey compared with previous work suggests star formation is highly dependent on the local environment .",
    "our new results provide several possibilities for the nature of low - mass star formation : _",
    "( i ) _ class  0 sources are at the same evolutionary stage as class  i sources , but represent a different branch of star formation , e.g. , star formation in high density environments .",
    "however , a comparison between our study and that of motte et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggests the lynds clouds are actually less dense than those in @xmath2 ophiuchus ; _ ( ii ) _ if class  0 sources are precursors to class  i sources , the local environment may determine the lifetime of the class  0 phase .",
    "for example , if the lynds clouds are more quiescent than those in @xmath2 ophiuchus , they may have more time to evolve towards the singular @xmath136 , which predicts a more uniform accretion rate . however",
    ", none of the starless cores detected here has the characteristics of a singular isothermal sphere ; _ ( iii ) _ star formation is not steady , and relies heavily on triggering .",
    "the ratio of class  0 to class  i protostars in @xmath2 ophiuchus can then be explained by being dominated by an older , more evolved population caused by a burst of star formation some @xmath4  yr ago .",
    "_ we regard this as the most likely possibility . _ furthermore , if the lifetime of the class  0 phase is actually similar to that of the class  i phase , class  0 protostars may not have such dramatically high accretion rates compared with class  i protostars , as has previously been assumed .",
    "the lifetime of the starless cores found in this survey is similar to the @xmath172  yr derived from surveys using the lack of an iras association to define `` starless '' ( e.g. , lee & myers 1999 ) .",
    "the cores therefore last only 23 free - fall times before collapsing .",
    "temperatures of only @xmath2412  k are needed for the dominant support mechanism of the cores to be thermal pressure .",
    "the starless cores are therefore on the verge of collapse , and it is unlikely that strong magnetic fields are important for the collapse dynamics of the cores on scales @xmath164  au .",
    "further work is needed to determine the velocity structure of these cores through molecular line spectroscopy .",
    "the authors thank the staff of the jcmt for carrying out some of the @xmath75co observations of the outflows in service observing mode .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for his / her careful reading of the text , and comments that have helped to clarify the paper .",

    "<S> we have carried out a survey of optically - selected dark clouds using the bolometer array scuba on the james clerk maxwell telescope , at @xmath0  @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> the survey covers a total of 0.5 square degrees and is unbiased with reference to cloud size , star formation activity , or the presence of infrared emission . </S>",
    "<S> several new protostars and starless cores have been discovered ; the protostars are confirmed through the detection of their accompanying outflows in co(21 ) emission . </S>",
    "<S> the survey is believed to be complete for class  0 and class  i protostars , and yields two important results regarding the lifetimes of these phases . </S>",
    "<S> first , the ratio of class  0 to class  i protostars in the sample is roughly unity , very different from the 1:10 ratio that has previously been observed for the @xmath2 ophiuchi star - forming region . assuming star formation to be a homogeneous process in the dark clouds , </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the class  0 lifetime is similar to the class  i phase , which from infrared surveys has been established to be @xmath3  yr . </S>",
    "<S> it also suggests there is no rapid initial accretion phase in class  0 objects . </S>",
    "<S> a burst of triggered star formation some @xmath4  yr ago can explain the earlier results for @xmath2 ophiuchus . </S>",
    "<S> second , the number of starless cores is approximately twice that of the total number of protostars , indicating a starless core lifetime of @xmath5  yr . </S>",
    "<S> these starless cores are therefore very short - lived , surviving only two or three free - fall times . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that , on size scales of @xmath6  au at least , the dynamical evolution of starless cores is probably not controlled by magnetic processes . </S>"
