    "in order to circumvent the point - charge singularity appearing in the maxwell theory , alternative lagrangians to the electromagnetism have been proposed or emerged ( as effective theories ) by other more fundamental theories .",
    "the common property of these lagrangians is that they are built up just in terms of the two local lorentz invariants of the electromagnetism @xcite in a nonlinear way .",
    "we cite for example the born - infeld lagrangian @xcite . under the theoretical point of view , such a lagrangian is interesting in the sense it renders a finite self - energy to the electron @xcite , it leads to an exact solution in general relativity @xcite , and a similar form to it appears as an effective lagrangian to the low - energy limit in string theory @xcite .",

    ", the effective medium interpretation can be applied @xcite .",
    "the converse is not necessarily true , as the dielectric tensors must satisfy certain differentiability constraints in order to assure the existence of a lagrangian .",
    "it would be true , for instance , for a medium whose permittivity and permeability are just dependent upon the electric and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "hence the aforesaid map could be useful for testing analogously nonlinear theories proposed in the literature ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) by means of engineering adequate metamaterials @xcite , as in general they are unlikely to be found in nature .",

    "it requires breaking time - reversal and parity symmetries of the system @xcite .",
    "it is possible to tailor some metamaterials to present asymmetry in light propagation @xcite .",
    "conditions have already been reached to obtain one - way propagation in terms of both phase and group velocities in some photonic crystals @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address the issue of one - way propagation of light in another context , namely , the nonlinear media described by dielectric coefficients , by proposing a model where such an effect is expected to take place . for doing so , we rely on the method of field disturbances applied to nonlinear media in the limit of geometric optics @xcite . for a limiting case ,",
    "we show that the proposed medium can be mapped onto the born - infeld lagrangian such that the one - way effect can be used to assess such theory .",
    "thus , this investigation would also be useful as an analog model , since the born - infeld scale field ( as large as @xmath0 ) is unlikely to be reached on terrestrial laboratories at the present time .    in the next section we elaborate on the general problem of propagation of disturbances in the limit of geometric optics by making use of the formalism developed by hadamard and papapetrou @xcite .",

    "in this work , we shall be interested in the propagation of weak electromagnetic disturbances in symmetric media described by @xmath52\\label{03}\\ ] ] and @xmath53\\label{04},\\ ] ] with @xmath54 a parameter characterizing each medium , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 its ( isotropic ) permittivity and permeability in the absence of fields .",

    "( [ 16 ] ) , the phase velocities tend to @xmath78 , as we already expected from the definition of @xmath79 .",
    "one also sees from the same equation that the family of media under interest is such that no ordinary waves ( isotropic waves @xcite ) propagate .",
    "the above equations show us that the birefringence effect ( defined here as the presence of two waves in a same wave vector direction , which implies that upon refraction two rays will propagate in the medium under interest ; see eqs .",
    "( [ 18])([20 ] ) and refs .",
    "@xcite ) will take place only in the region of the @xmath63 plane defined by @xmath80 hence , this region will exist iff @xmath81 . from now on , we shall consider this to be the case .",
    "it implies that the underlying medium ( picking out a particular @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) must present some negative dielectric tensor components , since in principle @xmath56 and @xmath55 could also be negative , for allowing the birefringence effect .",
    "notice that no condition is imposed on the controllable magnetic field for having the aforesaid optical effect .",
    "this will be in sharp contrast with the group velocity analysis , as we shall show later .",
    "once the limit of geometric optics is just meaningful for media where losses are negligible @xcite , we will assume that @xmath82 a case where the controllable fields lead to the phenomenon of birefringence in depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the selected set of the fields , the birefringent region",
    "is encompassed by the two thick straight lines .",
    "for the angles limited by the two dashed straight lines , no waves propagate . for the remaining angles ,",
    "just an extraordinary wave is present .    since the deduction of eq .",
    "( [ 014 ] ) has been done in the limit of geometric optics , it follows that the physically relevant velocities to be analyzed are the group velocities , that define the speed of the rays @xcite .",
    "this is the case once packets could be formed due to the linearization process brought by this limit when weak disturbances are present @xcite .",
    "the group velocities can be easily obtained from an implicit differentiation of the dispersion relation [ eq .",
    "( [ 014 ] ) ] @xcite by considering that @xmath83 and @xmath84 . from fields and waves",
    "satisfying our previous conditions , it is easy to show that the extraordinary group velocities associated with the extraordinary phase velocities , here denoted by @xmath85 , are given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a shortcut to @xmath90 , given by eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "hence , the extraordinary group velocities remain in the same plane as the phase velocities .",
    "it is possible to obtain analytically the main features concerning the group velocities . if one defines @xmath91 as the angle between the group velocity and the @xmath68 axis , then from eqs .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) , @xmath92 one sees that when @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "then , it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) that @xmath95 is symmetric about the @xmath68 axis , or @xmath96 .",
    "hence it suffices just analyzing the region @xmath97 .    if one substitutes eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) , one obtains @xmath98 where @xmath99 the solution to eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) is @xmath100\\label{25},\\ ] ] for @xmath101 .",
    "the above equation gives the relationship between the directions of the phase velocity and its associated group velocity .",
    "the `` @xmath102 '' signs mean that in general for a group velocity direction there are two associated wave vector directions .",
    "the converse is also true , as we commented before .",
    "for the case where eq .",
    "( [ 17b ] ) is valid , we already know that the phase velocity can not be imaginary by any angle @xmath66 and it implies from eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) that @xmath103 since @xmath104 by definition .",
    "therefore , the group velocities are always restricted to a region of the @xmath63 plane .",
    "[ fig2 ] depicts the above discussion for the same set of the parameters used in fig .",
    "birefringence is present for any chosen angle inside the two thick straight lines . in other words , for any angle inside this region , two extraordinary rays ( `` @xmath105 '' and `` @xmath106 '' ) propagate in a same direction . outside this region",
    ", rays do not propagate .",
    "phase and group velocities generally behave differently whenever the former is dependent upon the wave vector . in this case , it is easy to show that the group velocity can be cast as @xmath107 where @xmath108 stands for any of the extraordinary phase velocities solutions to the fresnel equation .",
    "hence , whenever @xmath109 , an orthogonal term to the phase velocity appears in the group velocity .",
    "this is precisely what leads in general to a difference in the aforesaid velocities .",
    "naturally this is the case in our analysis , as explicitly given by eqs .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) and depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for a particular choice of the strength fields and @xmath79 .    whenever one considers @xmath110 , eq .",
    "( [ 17b ] ) is trivially satisfied and one just has one refraction in terms of both waves and rays .",
    "the associated extraordinary waves and rays tend to @xmath111 when @xmath54 goes to infinity , as expected .",
    "nonetheless , setting @xmath81 and imposing real dielectric coefficients , a much richer scenario arises . in this configuration , there will always be a region where the one - way propagation phenomenon takes place in terms of rays , accompanied by birefringence .",
    "as we stressed previously , under certain conditions , there exists a correspondence between the maxwell theory in a nonlinear material medium and a nonlinear theory of electromagnetism .",
    "this theory , characterized by a given nonlinear lagrangian @xmath112 , emerges by the identifications @xcite @xmath113 in our case , the dielectric coefficients given by eqs .",
    "( [ 03 ] ) and ( [ 04 ] ) do not in general admit a lagrangian .",
    "this is so since the general condition fo guaranteeing the existence of @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( [ dihi ] ) , viz .",
    ", @xmath114 is not satisfied solely due to the fact that @xmath115 in general .",
    "nevertheless , for the particular case @xmath116 ( vacuum ) , we do have @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the two local invariants of the electromagnetism , and now the aforementioned medium parameter @xmath54 plays the role of the fundamental scale field to the theory .",
    "the above lagrangian is analogous to the born - infeld lagrangian @xcite and naturally raises from our analysis as a limiting case .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the born - infeld theory has recently been applied to the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that both in the nonrelativistic and relativistic theories of quantum mechanics , the fundamental scale field to the born - infeld theory must be much larger than @xmath120 , which was determined by born and infeld themselves by assuming the unitarian viewpoint @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , a definite value for such a scale field was not found .",
    "the aforementioned viewpoint does not influence the derivation of the born - infeld theory and it has been assumed under more philosophical grounds . since quantum mechanics is basically founded on the dualistic viewpoint @xcite and due to the success of the former theory relying on the maxwell lagrangian for the electromagnetic fields , the above mentioned result is not surprising . under the experimental point of view , such a fact makes the tests of the born - infeld lagrangian even subtler , since fields as large as the ones mentioned above are at the present time unrealistic in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "notice that the denominators of eqs .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) are proportional to the square - root term in eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "it means that whenever @xmath121 is negative , the group velocities associated with eqs .  ( [ 03 ] ) and ( [ 04 ] ) become superluminal , whilst this is not the case for the phase velocities . if the dielectric tensors are real ( losses are negligible and geometric optics is meaningful @xcite ) , it is then guaranteed that @xmath121 is positive [ see eqs .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) and ( [ 17b ] ) ] and hence superluminal group solutions do not rise in our model . besides , our reasoning also implies that whenever eq .",
    "( [ 17b ] ) is set , the controllable fields are not independent in the sense that the electric field must be dependent upon typically magnetic parameters , such as currents , and magnetic fields must depend upon charge densities .",
    "indeed this is the case , since the associated field equations are nonlinear .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the dielectric coefficients given by eq .",
    "( [ 03 ] ) and ( [ 04 ] ) for @xmath122 have a notable property : their associated fresnel equation is independent of @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the aforementioned media that have dielectric tensors with @xmath124 , but without the @xmath123 dependence , are also expected to display birefringence and one - way propagation effects .",
    "this could possibly be of experimental importance .",
    "other powers of @xmath123 in eqs .",
    "( [ 03 ] ) and ( [ 04 ] ) for @xmath79 close to unity would lead to similar optical effects as the ones in the media sketched out before just in the vicinities of @xmath125 .",
    "kruglov @xcite has analyzed some wave aspects of a modified version of the born - infeld lagrangian , where there are two scale fields .",
    "when the scale fields are the same in his description , birefringence disappears due to the simple fact it was assumed that the waves propagate just in an external magnetic field .",
    "this result can be immediately seen from our description when @xmath126 [ see eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) ] .    if the media characterized by eqs .  ( [ 03 ] ) and ( [ 04 ] ) could be tailored and fields inside them could be controlled by convenient charge densities , then birefringence and one - way propagation of light are supposed to take place .",
    "besides , as a quick glance in eqs .",
    "( [ 03 ] ) , ( [ 04 ] ) , ( [ 17b ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) reveal , the underlying media must present some negative dielectric components for allowing the above - mentioned optical effects .",
    "this suggests that birefringence and one - way propagation of light could be found just in the realm of metamaterials and probably have not been observed due to the very fine tuning of fields and tailored media they require . as a by - product of the aforementioned investigation , using continuity arguments for @xmath79 , one could indirectly assess the born - infeld lagrangian in the realm of fields larger than its scale parameter .",
    "direct investigations of such a lagrangian would be possible just in the limiting case @xmath79 tends to one , the case of a medium whose dielectric properties in the absence of controllable fields are close to the vacuum .",
    "anisotropic media could emerge from the so - called layered media @xcite . by a convenient choice of the base layers ,",
    "nonlinear media that exhibit negative dielectric coefficients can always be tailored .",
    "we hope this could be the case for the media proposed in this work , or they could rise by other means , as the technology of manipulating metamaterials is developing quickly @xcite .",
    "issues connected with losses in metamaterials are also of importance , since in the limit of geometric optics , wave and ray propagation are just meaningful in lossless media @xcite .",
    "it is known that significant progresses are being made in this direction @xcite .",
    "applications concerning the optical effects analyzed in this work could be envisaged , for instance as optical diodes , due to the controlled unidirectional nature these metamaterials are expected to display either in terms of waves or rays . besides , one could also in principle investigate analogously phenomena in black holes physics , as one - way propagation is also supposed to take place in such a scenario .",
