    "when constraining the star formation , metallicity and gas / dust content of galaxies , the initial mass function ( imf ) is often assumed to be universal and equal to that of the solar neighborhood ( kroupa 2001 ; chabrier 2003 ; bastian , covey & meyer 2010 ) .",
    "however , evidence has recently emerged that the imf might evolve ( dav 2008 ; van dokkum 2008 ) or depend on the stellar mass of the system ( e.g. worthey 1992 ; trager et al .",

    "van dokkum & conroy ( 2010 ; hereafter vdc10 ) suggested that low - mass stars ( @xmath13 ) could be more prevalent in massive early - type galaxies .",
    "the increase in the mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) of galaxies with galaxy mass may thus be partly due to a changing imf rather than an increasing dark matter fraction , consistent with previous suggestions ( treu et al .",

    "vdc10 showed that some spectral features , such as the @xmath14 doublet ( called nai0.82 by cvd12 ) , depend strongly on surface gravity at fixed effective temperature , betraying the presence of faint m dwarfs in integrated light spectra .",
    "if correct , the low - mass end of the imf can be inferred directly from red / near - ir spectra of old populations .",
    "hence , the strength of the doublet versus another sodium feature , such as the nad doublet ( called na0.59 by cvd12 ) , should provide a powerful means for separating the imf from other effects .",
    "specifically for the purpose of determining the low - mass imf down to @xmath15 for metal - rich stellar populations with ages of 313.5 gyr , conroy & van dokkum ( 2012 ; hereafter cvd12 ) presented new population synthesis models .",
    "the nad feature responds more strongly to na - enhancement than imf in the cvd12 models , while the doublet is strong in stars with mass @xmath16 and weak or absent in all other types of stars . unfortunately , nai0.82 is also sensitive to age and metallicity , and nad is influenced by any interstellar medium .",
    "it is therefore necessary to test these models over a range of age and metallicity indicators , as well as against other lines caused by low - mass stars . in this letter , we focus on the nai feature as indicator of low - mass stars .",
    "we use nad as indicator of a change in sodium abundance and h@xmath17 and [ mgfe ] as indicators of age and metallicity , respectively .",
    "this allows us to assess model degeneracies and deficiencies .",
    "we propose the use of the tio feature at @xmath36230 as an indicator of the presence of low - mass stars .",
    "we find that both of these features ( nai and tio ) correlate with galaxy velocity dispersion , implying a steepening of the imf slope in etgs with @xmath18 .",

    "the lens galaxy shows a surprisingly deep nai0.82 feature ( fig.[fig : spectra ] ) , making it an extremely interesting target for studying the low - mass end of the imf in etgs .",
    "we measure the luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy from the reduced flux - calibrated 1d uvb  vis spectrum using the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) code of cappellari & emsellem ( 2004 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath23 , in agreement with the previously published value ( @xmath24 ; bolton et al .",

    "we examine one system , sdssj0041 - 0914 , separately because it has a nai0.82 feature comparably deep to the xlens system .",
    "we use the synthetic spectra of cvd12 to analyze the stellar populations of these galaxies .",
    "the models make use of two separate empirical libraries , the miles library covering 35007400  ( snchez - blzquez et al .",

    "we refer to cvd12 for details .",
    "the abundance variations of single elements are implemented at fixed [ fe / h ] , which implies that the total metallicity @xmath26 varies from model to model .",

    "we define a modified index around the doublet @xmath28 , which seems to be strongly dependent on the low - mass end of the imf ( table  1 ) .",

    "given the uncertainties in the line - strengths of the two individual galaxies ( sdssj0912 + 0029 and sdssj0041 - 0914 ) , we are unable to determine their ages and metallicities precisely , but their line strengths are similar to the mean of the highest - mass sdss sample , with a deviation from the average ew smaller than @xmath37 in both age and metallicity .",
    "the nai and nad indices can in principle be used to constrain the imf slope ( cvd12 ) , and this relation is shown in figure 2b . although the data match the models for low - dispersion systems ( @xmath38250@xmath12 ) , the models with solar [ na / fe ] abundance do not match the nad strengths and only models with @xmath5}=+0.3 \\,-\\,+0.4 $ ] dex match the nad indices for higher - mass etgs .",
    "we suggest two possible explanations for this behavior : ( i ) nad is highly contaminated by the interstellar medium ( ism ) for higher mass etgs ; for example , dust lanes provide additional absorption in this resonance line ( sparks et al .",
    "interstellar absorption within a galaxy may alter the stellar absorption profile and therefore the calculated ew , leading to an incorrect inference of the underlying stellar population .",
    "( ii ) very massive etgs have higher [ na / fe ] abundances ( @xmath39 dex ) _ and _ slightly bottom - heavy imfs which correlate with their stellar velocity dispersions . therefore ,",
    "if we explain the strengths of these features in giant etgs using abundance ratios , we require an average iron abundance in excess of solar ( [ fe / h ] @xmath40 ) , a imf with @xmath30 and a high sodium abundance ( [ na / h ] @xmath41 ) . in the @xmath42enhanced bulge of the galaxy , fulbright et al .",

    "it is therefore possible for massive ellipticals to have high [ na / fe ] . in both cases ,",
    "the models seem consistent with a salpeter imf at the low - dispersion end and a slightly bottom - heavy imf for the high - dispersion end , if these effects are accounted for , but the models predict a steeper imf slope of @xmath48 for both the xlens galaxy sdssj0912 + 0029 and sdssj0041 - 0914 .",

    "we find that ti enhancement only affect the nai index by 1% .",
    "overall we conclude that the nad ews and its trend with stellar mass remain unexplained for systems with @xmath50@xmath12 .",
    "we find that ssp models predict that tio features also depend strongly on the slope of the low - mass end of the imf , such as tio2 , shown in figures 2c and 2d .",
    "this indicator gives more support to the conclusion that the sodium strengths of the xlens etg , sdssj0912 + 0029 , still remain somewhat difficult to explain by current stellar population models , although most sdss systems can be matched in nai for most etgs ( if not in nad ) .",
    "together the tio2 and nai indices both imply a bottom - heavy imf , steepening from salpeter to possibly @xmath51 for the most massive sdss etgs . as in treu",

    "<S> we measure equivalent widths ( ew )  focussing on two unique features ( nai and tio2 ) of low - mass stars ( @xmath0m@xmath1 )  for luminous red galaxy spectra from the the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and x - shooter lens survey ( xlens ) in order to study the low - mass end of the initial mass function ( imf ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these ews to those derived from simple stellar population models computed with different imfs , ages , [ @xmath2/fe ] , and elemental abundances . </S>",
    "<S> we find that models are able to simultaneously reproduce the observed nad @xmath35895 and @xmath38190 features for lower - mass ( @xmath4 ) early - type galaxies ( etgs ) but deviate increasingly for more massive etgs , due do strongly mismatching nad ews . </S>",
    "<S> the tio2 @xmath36230 and the @xmath38190 features together appear to be a powerful imf diagnostic , with age and metallicity effects orthogonal to the effect of imf . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both features correlate strongly with galaxy velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the xlens etg ( sdssj0912 + 0029 ) and an sdss etg ( sdssj0041 - 0914 ) appear to require both an extreme dwarf - rich imf and a high sodium enhancement ( @xmath5}=+0.4 $ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , lensing constraints on the total mass of the xlens system within its einstein radius limit a bottom - heavy imf with a power - law slope to @xmath6 at the @xmath7 c.l . we conclude that nai and tio features , in comparison with state - of - the - art ssp models , suggest a mildly steepening imf from salpeter ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 ) to @xmath10 for etgs in the range @xmath11@xmath12 . </S>"
