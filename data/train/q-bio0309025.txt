    "coherent neuronal oscillations have been implicated widely as a correlate of brain function  @xcite . however , our understanding of the mechanisms underlying such activity is still in its infancy .",
    "( see @xcite  ( @xcite ) and @xcite  ( @xcite ) for recent reviews ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite , computationally  @xcite , and analytically  @xcite that mutual inhibition can generate stable synchronous oscillations .",
    "previous analytical work mostly concentrated on the mechanisms responsible for synchronization . here",
    "we address the mechanisms for controlling the network frequency and the interplay between frequency and synchronization .",
    "previously  @xcite , we showed that synchronization of inhibitory networks can occur in a wide range of frequencies for homogeneous neurons , but in the presence of heterogeneity network synchronization is very fragile in some parameter regimes .",
    "we have identified a pair of parameter regimes , denoted ` phasic ' and ` tonic ' ; in the former some coherence is maintained in the presence of mild heterogeneity , while in the latter it is lost . in this paper , we relate these regimes to the parameters that determine the frequency of the network when it is synchronized .",
    "there are three important time constants in the network dynamics .",
    "one is an intrinsic time constant of the uncoupled cell , dependent on the conductances and the capacitance of the membrane .",
    "the second is the decay time of the inhibition .",
    "the third , the network period , depends on the other two time scales and other parameters , notably the synaptic conductance and injected current . the aim of this paper is to understand how the first and second time constants influence the third .",
    "we show that there are three asymptotic regimes , in which the network period varies differently as the inhibitory time constant is changed .",
    "two of these are the tonic and phasic  @xcite regimes mentioned above and the third we call ` fast ' . in the tonic regime ,",
    "the period is small compared with both the intrinsic time scale and the synaptic decay time . in this regime , we show that the network frequency is only weakly dependent on the inhibitory decay time ; indeed , the frequency is affected mainly by the average amount of inhibition , not by the time course of that inhibition . in the phasic regime ,",
    "the intrinsic membrane time scale is small compared with the network period and the synaptic decay time . in this regime",
    ", we show that the network period is proportional to the decay time , with the proportionality constant a function of other network parameters . in the fast regime ,",
    "the synaptic decay time is short compared to the network period . in this regime ,",
    "the period is dominated by the intrinsic time constant .",
    "we give constraints on the network parameters ( intrinsic membrane time scale , synaptic decay time , synaptic conductance and applied current ) for the network to fall into each of the three asymptotic regimes .",
    "the three regimes can be related to the behavior of the network in the presence of mild heterogeneity , as shown numerically in white _ et al . _  ( @xcite )",
    ". in the fast regime , the synaptic influence acts as a brief inhibitory pulse which has been shown to lead to stable anti - synchronous oscillations @xcite . in the phasic and tonic regimes , synchrony through inhibition is fairly robust for homogeneous networks of neurons over a wide range of network frequencies  @xcite .",
    "however , it is very fragile when even mild heterogeneity is included @xcite .",
    "we showed that the loss of coherence of the network happens by different mechanisms in the tonic and phasic regimes @xcite . in the tonic regime ,",
    "mildly heterogeneous networks are effectively de - coupled and exhibit asynchrony ( loss of phase relationships among the cells ) ; in the phasic regime , the network can lose some coherence via suppression , in which the slower cells receive enough inhibition to prevent their firing .",
    "our analytical work uses a reduced membrane description for the neuron with a biophysically - based synaptic model .",
    "the analysis is for a homogeneous network ; when considering the frequency of a synchronous solution , we can regard the network as a single self - inhibited neuron .",
    "we show that in the phasic regime , the synaptic current dominates and the actual intrinsic membrane dynamics are not as important for the firing frequency . in the tonic regime ,",
    "the intrinsic dynamics do become more important .",
    "we give a comparison between our analytical estimates for the period and those obtained numerically for conductance - based neuron models .",
    "the work in this paper , in conjunction with  @xcite  ( @xcite ) shows that , in the presence of mild heterogeneity , the control of frequency is strongly tied to the time scale of the mechanism that produces the synchronization .",
    "that is , in order to have coherence for a mildly heterogeneous system , the latter must be in the phasic regime , which then implies that the frequency is controlled by the time constant of the inhibitory decay .",
    "it was found experimentally and numerically that the frequency of coherently firing interneurons in the ca1 region of the hippocampus is strongly dependent on the decay time of the inhibitory synapse  @xcite .",
    "the analytical work given in this paper clarifies the reasons for this frequency behavior as well as the remark found in many papers that the inhibitory decay time can be a critical factor in the determination of the network frequency  @xcite .",
    "we consider the frequency control of so called type i neuronal dynamics  @xcite and examine simplifications that would make it more amenable to analysis .",
    "these neurons are distinguished by the fact that they have positive _ phase response curves _ ( prc )  @xcite .",
    "i.e.  a positive depolarizing current always advances the time of the next spike .",
    "it has been shown recently that neurons which admit very low frequency oscillations near the critical applied current are type i  @xcite although the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "we note that the type of bifurcation to firing of the neuron is not important for our analysis .",
    "type i neurons have been used to represent inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus  @xcite .",
    "we consider an inhibitory network of single - compartment neurons with membrane potential dynamics of the form  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an applied current , @xmath2 are the ionic currents responsible for spike generation and recovery and @xmath3 is the synaptic current induced by the spikes of other neurons coupled pre - synaptically .",
    "the ionic currents @xmath2 are functions of potential and the dependent dynamical variables , which are in turn governed by a system of differential equations . in the appendix",
    "we give the equations for two conductance - based neuron models  @xcite , which are type i or at least very close to type i ( data not shown ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spike ] shows example voltage traces for the two models .",
    "the coupling between the neurons is exclusively through chemical synapses represented by the synaptic current which takes the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the synaptic rise and decay rates , @xmath8 is the membrane potential of the pre - synaptic neuron , and @xmath9)$ ]",
    ". we will often consider the synaptic decay time @xmath10 .",
    "we approximate the full conductance - based dynamics with integrate - and - fire dynamics where the firing of the neuron is represented by the resetting of the membrane potential whenever it crosses a threshold .",
    "our justification for using this approximation hinges on three considerations : 1 ) both the conductance - based and integrate - and - fire models are type i ( in the sense of positive prc ) , 2 ) the action potentials ( spike widths ) are narrow compared to their typical spiking period so the frequency is dominated by the membrane recovery time , and 3 ) the time scale for spike generation is very fast compared to the recovery time so an effective threshold for spiking can be defined .",
    "the first point was verified by observing that the measured prc of the conductance - based models near the bifurcation to firing is positive .",
    "we model the approach to threshold with a simple passive decay to obtain dynamics governed by a single equation of the form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an effective membrane recovery conductance , @xmath13 is an effective membrane reversal potential and @xmath14 is a synaptic reversal potential .",
    "@xmath15 is reset to @xmath16 whenever it reaches the threshold potential @xmath17 .",
    "the passive decay to threshold is a very good approximation for some neuronal models such as the reduced traub and miles model given in the appendix  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we will show that even when the passive decay is not a good approximation to the slow dynamics of the neuron model , it can still adequately describe the frequency behavior , especially in the phasic regime where the synaptic current dominates .",
    "the synaptic current @xmath18 is generated from the spikes of pre - synaptic neurons .",
    "this must be emulated in the reduced model ( [ if1 ] ) .",
    "here we consider @xmath18 to be an arbitrary time dependent function . in sec .",
    "[ sec : syn ] , we analyze some biophysical synaptic models in detail and explicitly derive the time course of @xmath18 in response to a pre - synaptic spike .    to simplify the analysis , we rescale eq .",
    "( [ if1 ] ) so that only dimensionless parameters remain .",
    "the voltage can be rescaled via @xmath19 , so that the reset potential is at @xmath20 and the threshold is at @xmath21 .",
    "we define an intrinsic membrane decay time @xmath22 and rescale time by @xmath23 .",

    "the neuron is said to fire each time @xmath29 reaches 1 , whereupon it immediately resets to @xmath20 .",
    "it is important to note that this does not restrict @xmath29 to nonnegative values away from @xmath30 .",

    "( [ re ] ) as model 1 and the one given by eq .",
    "( [ re2 ] ) as model 2 .",
    "the two models differ in that the synapse acts solely as a forcing function in model 2 , but also affects the membrane decay rate in model 1 .",
    "as we will show , the frequency behavior of the two models is qualitatively similar even if @xmath33 is not small .",
    "we will focus most attention on model 2 in our analysis .",
    "the synchronization tendencies of model 2 for slow synapses has been studied thoroughly @xcite .",
    "in conductance - based neuron models , the post - synaptic current is initiated by a pre - synaptic spike . in the reduced model , the spikes",
    "have been eliminated so this process must be modeled .",
    "we do so by deriving the synaptic time course for eq .",

    "we divide synapses into two types  _ saturating _ and _ nonsaturating_. if the synaptic variable @xmath35 increases without bound as the rate of firing of the pre - synaptic cell approaches infinity then we call this a nonsaturating synapse . if however , @xmath35 saturates to a fixed value as the firing rate approaches infinity then we call this a saturating synapse",

    "this is expected because the period behavior is dominated by the choice of synaptic model ( which is the same in the analysis and simulations ) . in the tonic regime ,",
    "the effect of the synapse is weak and the frequency characteristics are more like that of the uncoupled neuron .",
    "thus differences in the intrinsic membrane dynamics will be the most prominent here .",
    "the period of the uncoupled reduced model obeys the classic result @xmath160  @xcite , and we showed in the tonic regime that the synapse affects the period only by changing the amount of tonic input the neuron receives .",
    "the period of the type i neurons in the sense of @xcite  ( @xcite ) behave as @xmath161 near the bifurcation point .",
    "thus at least near the onset of firing , the frequency behavior as a function of @xmath102 should not be the same .",
    "as the synapse becomes stronger , the influence of the synaptic dynamics begins to compete with the intrinsic membrane dynamics . deep within the phasic regime",
    "the synaptic dynamics completely dominate and the period is primarily determined by the response of the neuron to inhibition .",
    "our analysis showed that the intrinsic dynamics are not important in the phasic regime .",
    "however , the use of model 2 instead of model 1 for equation ( [ transfull ] ) will result in quantitative inaccuracies even well within in the phasic regime .",
    "in this paper , we show that a fully synchronized network can have its frequency determined by several parameters , including applied currents , synaptic strength and synaptic decay time",
    ". however , in regimes other than the phasic regime , in which parameters other than the synaptic decay dominate the network frequency , even mild heterogeneity can eliminate coherence  @xcite . indeed , in that work we showed that increasing the drive @xmath102 , which increases the uncoupled frequency of each cell or the common frequency of a homogenous inhibitory network , can desynchronize a mildly heterogeneous network .",
    "this is true even if the percentage difference in natural frequencies over the population is held constant .",
    "decreasing the drive sufficiently puts the network in a regime where inhibition suppresses spiking in less excitable cells .",
    "this also causes a loss of coherence albeit through a different mechanism .",
    "these two effects limit the possible frequencies at which the network can be synchronized , and the time scale of the synapse plays a crucial role in determining the width of this frequency band .    with respect to the hippocampus ,",
    "the analysis predicts the fast 200 hz ripples observed in ca1  @xcite , can not be solely mediated by gaba@xmath162 synaptic inhibition , whose time scales are much slower than 5  ms . an additional mechanism such as gap junction mediated electrical coupling may be responsible for the observed synchronous fast ripples .",
    "the 40 hz gamma rhythm , which is on the order of the time scale of gaba@xmath162 , can be supported by inhibition alone .",
    "this was observed in experiments in hippocampal slices  @xcite .",
    "our results on the dependence of the period on the synaptic decay time constant clarifies the experimental observations .",
    "our analysis predicts that for coherent oscillations , the network should be in the phasic regime . to compare with the analysis , we replotted the experimental data of @xcite  ( @xcite ) as _ period _ versus synaptic decay time in fig .",
    "[ fig : jeff ] .",
    "we note that the period @xmath78 is proportional to the decay time @xmath98 , as predicted for the phasic regime .",
    "furthermore , @xmath163 has a value less than 1 , consistent with the requirement for being in the phasic regime .    for homogeneous networks ,",
    "the time scale of the inhibition is not critical for the frequency of a synchronized network .",
    "a homogeneous network can stably synchronize at parameter regimes outside the phasic regime .",
    "however , for a mildly heterogeneous network , the synchronization mechanism must not only draw together phases , but must also help create a common frequency . as shown in  @xcite , inhibitory synapses in the phasic regime",
    "_ do _ provide such a mechanism for heterogeneous networks .",
    "we wish to point out that this frequency dependent synchronization is not necessary for all networks .",
    "for instance , consider a network coupled with ( nonrectified ) electrical coupling . in the fully synchronized state ,",
    "the coupling currents disappear and hence do not contribute to the network frequency . with mild heterogeneity , the network still can maintain coherence , but there is no time constant to affect the network frequency .",
    "the connection of the frequency of a synchronized network with inhibition to the inhibitory decay time has previously been understood intuitively  @xcite . here",
    "we present a simple example to clarify how all of the relevant time scales interact to produce the regimes in which that intuition is correct .",
    "these conclusions assume that the membrane potential between spikes is governed by a passive decay process that approaches a fixed threshold .",
    "the reduction from model 1 to model 2 simplifies the effect of the synapse .",
    "the accuracy of our analytical calculations depend on the validity of these approximations .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the three regimes to still exist for a much larger class of conductance based models and models of synapses .",
    "evidence for this conjecture was given in section  [ example ] .",
    "we note that  @xcite  ( @xcite ) have shown that for weakly coupled systems an arbitrary type i excitable neuron can be transformed into integrate - and - fire form by a piece - wise continuous change of variables .",
    "our results show that this correspondence can hold beyond the weak coupling limit .",
