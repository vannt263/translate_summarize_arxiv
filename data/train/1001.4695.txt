    "mathematics is the art of abstraction and generalization . historically ,",
    "`` numbers '' were first natural numbers ; then rational , negative , real , and complex numbers were introduced ( in some order ) .",
    "similarly , the concept of taking derivatives has been generalized from first , second , and higher order derivatives to `` fractional calculus '' of noninteger orders ( see for instance @xcite ) , and there is also some work on fractional iteration .",
    "however , when we add some number of terms , this number ( of terms ) is still generally considered a natural number : we can add two , seven , or possibly zero numbers , but what is the sum of the first @xmath0 natural numbers , or the first @xmath1 terms of the harmonic series ?    in this note , we show that there is a very natural way of extending summations to the case when the `` number of terms '' is real or even complex .",
    "one would think that this method should have been discovered at least two hundred years ago  and that is what we initially suspected as well . to our surprise , this method does not seem to have been investigated in the literature , or to be known by the experts , apart from sporadic remarks even in euler s work @xcite ( see equation ( [ eq : euler ] ) below ) .",
    "of course , one of the standard methods to introduce the @xmath2 function is an example of a summation with a complex number of terms ; we discuss this in section  [ secfromaxtodef ] , equation ( [ eqgamma ] ) .    since this note is meant to be an introduction to an unusual way of adding , we skip some of the proofs and refer the reader instead to the more formal note @xcite . some of our results were initially announced in @xcite .",
    "we start by giving natural conditions for summations with an arbitrary complex number of terms ; here @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are complex numbers and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are complex - valued functions defined on @xmath9 or subsets thereof , subject to some conditions that we specify later :    ( s1 ) continued summation : :    @xmath10 ( s2 ) translation invariance : :    @xmath11 ( s3 ) linearity : :    for arbitrary constants @xmath12 ,    @xmath13 ( s4 ) consistency with classical definition : :    @xmath14 ( s5 ) monomials : :    for every @xmath15 , the mapping    @xmath16 is holomorphic in @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath17 right shift continuity : :    if @xmath18 pointwise for every    @xmath19 , then    @xmath20 more generally , if there is a sequence of    polynomials @xmath21 of fixed degree    such that , as @xmath22 ,    @xmath23 for all    @xmath19 , we require that    @xmath24    the first four axioms ( s1)(s4 ) are so obvious that it is hard to imagine any summation theory that violates these . they easily imply @xmath25 for every @xmath26 , so we are being consistent with the classical definition of summation .",
    "axiom ( s5 ) is motivated by the well - known formulas @xmath27 and similarly for higher powers ; we shall show below that our axioms imply that all those formulas remain valid for arbitrary @xmath28 .",
    "finally , axiom @xmath17 is a natural condition also .",
    "the first case , in ( [ eqs5 ] ) , expresses the view that if @xmath7 tends to zero , then the summation `` on the bounded domain '' @xmath29 $ ] should do the same . in ( [ eqs5b ] ) ,",
    "the same holds , except an approximating polynomial is added ; compare the discussion after proposition  [ prop1 ] .",
    "it will turn out that for a large class of functions @xmath7 , there is a unique way to define a sum @xmath30 with @xmath19 that respects all these axioms . in the next section",
    ", we will derive this definition and denote such sums by @xmath31 .",
    "we call them `` fractional sums . ''      to see how these conditions determine a summation method uniquely , we start by summing up polynomials .",
    "the simplest such case is the sum @xmath32 with @xmath33 constant .",
    "if axiom ( s1 ) is respected , then @xmath34 applying axioms ( s2 ) on the left and ( s4 ) on the right - hand side , one gets @xmath35 it follows that @xmath36 .",
    "this simple calculation can be extended to cover every sum of polynomials with a rational number of terms .",

    "conversely , every summation theory that satisfies axioms ( s1 ) , ( s2 ) , ( s3 ) , and ( s4 ) also satisfies  ( [ eqsumpoly ] ) for every polynomial @xmath42 and all @xmath43 with rational difference @xmath44 .",
    "* every summation theory that satisfies ( s1 ) , ( s2 ) , ( s3 ) , ( s4 ) , and ( s5 ) also satisfies  ( [ eqsumpoly ] ) for every polynomial @xmath42 and all @xmath43 .    to prove the first statement ,",
    "suppose we use ( [ eqsumpoly ] ) as a definition .",
    "it is trivial to check that this definition satisfies ( s1 ) , ( s3 ) , ( s4 ) , and ( s5 ) . to see that it also satisfies ( s2 ) ,",
    "consider a polynomial @xmath42 and the unique corresponding polynomial @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath39 .",
    "define @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "hence @xmath51 to see that ( [ eqsumpoly ] ) also satisfies @xmath17 , let @xmath52 be the linear space of complex polynomials of degree less than or equal to @xmath53 .",
    "the definition @xmath54 for @xmath55 introduces a norm on @xmath52 .",
    "if we define a linear operator @xmath56 via @xmath57 , then this operator is bounded since @xmath58 .",
    "thus , if @xmath59 is a sequence of polynomials with @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 .",
    "axiom @xmath17 then follows from considering the sequence of polynomials @xmath62 with @xmath63 and noting that pointwise convergence to zero implies convergence to zero in the norm @xmath64 of @xmath65 , and thus of @xmath66 .    to prove the second statement , we extend the idea that we used above to show that @xmath67 . using ( s1 ) , we write for an integer @xmath68 @xmath69 where the left - hand side has a classical interpretation , using ( s1 ) , ( s2 ) , and ( s4 ) . rewriting the right - hand side according to ( s2 ) and using ( s3 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath70 where the @xmath71 are polynomials of degree @xmath72 ( and all @xmath73 ) .",
    "now we argue by induction .",
    "if @xmath74 , the previous equation clearly determines @xmath75 and by linearity also the corresponding sum over arbitrary constants @xmath33 .",
    "once the value of the sum of any polynomial of degree @xmath72 is determined , the equality also determines the value of @xmath76 , and by linearity , the sum of every polynomial @xmath42 of degree @xmath77 . using ( s2 ) again",
    ", we see that the axioms ( s1 ) to ( s4 ) uniquely determine the sum @xmath78 if @xmath44 .",
    "as we have seen , equation  ( [ eqsumpoly ] ) is a possible definition satisfying those axioms ; hence it is the only possible definition for @xmath44 .",
    "finally , it is clear how the restriction @xmath44 can be lifted by additionally assuming ( s5 ) ( equation ( [ eqsumpoly ] ) is already satisfied for @xmath79 by requiring just continuity in ( s5 ) ; holomorphy is required for @xmath80 ) .",
    "consider now an arbitrary function @xmath81 .",
    "if we are interested in @xmath82 for complex @xmath43 , we can write @xmath83 where @xmath26 is an arbitrary natural number .",
    "hence , @xmath84 what have we achieved by this elementary rearrangement ? in the last line , the first sum on the right - hand side involves an integer number of terms , so this can be evaluated classically .",
    "all the problems sit in the last sum on the right - hand side .",
    "the payoff is that we have translated the domain of summation by @xmath85 to the right .",
    "since ( [ eqheuristics ] ) holds for every integer @xmath85 , we can use @xmath17 to evaluate the limit as @xmath86 : if @xmath87 as @xmath86 for all @xmath5 , then @xmath17 implies that the limit as @xmath86 of the last sum should vanish .",
    "we get @xmath88    this is of course a special condition to impose on @xmath7 , but the same idea can be generalized .",
    "for example , if @xmath89 , then for @xmath90\\subset{\\mathbb{r}}^+$ ] , the values @xmath91 are approximated well by the constant function @xmath92 , with an error that tends to @xmath93 as @xmath86 : we say that @xmath94 is `` approximately constant . '' using ( s3 ) , @xmath95 for every @xmath26 .",
    "but by @xmath17 , the last sum vanishes as @xmath86 , while the first sum on the right - hand side has a constant summand and is evaluated using proposition  [ prop1 ] . taking the limit @xmath86 in ( [ eqheuristics ] )",
    ", it follows by necessity that @xmath96    before generalizing our definition further , we take courage by observing that this interpolates the factorial function in the classical way : we define @xmath97 and thus get @xmath98 using a well - known product representation of the @xmath2 function  @xcite .",
    "it is now straightforward to use the heuristic calculation in ( [ eqheuristics ] ) together with proposition  [ prop1 ] and axiom @xmath17 to derive a general definition : all we need is that the value of @xmath99 can be approximated by some sequence of polynomials @xmath100 of fixed degree for @xmath86 .",
    "some care is needed with the domains of definition : the example of the logarithm shows that it is inconvenient to restrict to functions which are defined on all of @xmath9 .",
    "all we need is a domain of definition @xmath101 with the property that @xmath102 implies @xmath103 .",
    "this leads to the following ( using the convention that the zero polynomial is the unique polynomial of degree @xmath104 ) .",
    "[ deffracsummable ] let @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "a function @xmath107 will be called _ fractional summable of degree @xmath108 _ if the following conditions are satisfied :    * @xmath109 for all @xmath110 ; * there exists a sequence of polynomials @xmath21 of fixed degree @xmath108 such that for all @xmath110 @xmath111 * for every @xmath112 , the limit @xmath113 exists , where @xmath114 is defined as in  ( [ eqsumpoly ] ) .    in this case",
    ", we will use the notation @xmath115 for this limit .",
    "moreover , we can define fractional products by @xmath116 whenever @xmath117 is fractional summable .",
    "note that this definition does not depend on the choice of the approximating polynomials @xmath21 : if @xmath118 is another choice of approximating polynomials , then @xmath119 for all @xmath110 , and hence for all @xmath120 since the set of polynomials of degree at most @xmath108 is a finite - dimensional linear space .",
    "as shown in proposition  [ prop1 ] , sums of polynomials satisfy axiom @xmath17 . substituting @xmath93 for @xmath7 and @xmath121 for @xmath122 in @xmath17",
    "proves that @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , this definition is the unique definition that satisfies axioms ( s1 ) to @xmath17 :    definition  [ deffracsummable ] satisfies all the axioms ( s1 ) to @xmath17 ( for suitable domains of definition ) , and it is the unique definition with this property ( for the class of functions that we are considering ) .",
    "we have already proved uniqueness above , by deriving definition  [ deffracsummable ] from the axioms ( s1 ) to @xmath17 .",
    "it remains to prove that this definition indeed satisfies all the axioms .",
    "clearly , ( s3 ) and ( s5 ) are automatically satisfied . substituting the definition into ( s1 ) , ( s2 ) , and ( s4 ) , these axioms can be confirmed by a few lines of direct calculation .",
    "to prove @xmath17 , we use the definition and the other axioms ( in particular continued summation ( s1 ) ) and calculate @xmath124 this proves that definition  [ deffracsummable ] satisfies all the axioms .",
    "now that we have a definition of sums with noninteger numbers of terms , it is interesting to find out how many of the properties of classical finite sums remain valid in this more general setting , and what new properties arise that are not visible in the classical case .",
    "one of the most basic identities for finite sums is the geometric series . for simplicity ,",
    "let @xmath125 .",
    "then the function @xmath126 is approximately zero ( we have @xmath127 for every @xmath19 ) , and the definition reads @xmath128 thus , the formula for the geometric series remains valid for every @xmath120 .",
    "a similar calculation shows that the binomial series remains valid in the fractional case : for every @xmath129 and @xmath120 with @xmath130 , we have @xmath131    there are generalizations of ( [ eqgeometric ] ) to the case @xmath132 and of ( [ eqbinomial ] ) to the case @xmath133 : these involve a `` left sum '' as introduced in section  [ secleftsummation ] .",
    "an example of a summation identity with more complicated structure is given by the series multiplication formula @xmath134 for every @xmath120 , given that all the three fractional sums exist ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  7 ) ; it generalizes the formula @xmath135 , and similarly for all positive integers @xmath3 .",

    "many basic fractional sums are related to special functions . as a first example , consider the harmonic series . since @xmath140 is approximately zero , the definition reads @xmath141 and in particular @xmath142 which was noticed already by euler  ( * ? ? ? * ,  19 ) . for general @xmath3",

    "everybody knows the formula @xmath158 , so @xmath159 , and thus by ( [ eqzeta12 ] ) @xmath160 it follows that @xmath161 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath162 ( in the second equality , we interchanged differentiation and fractional summation ; it is not hard to check that this is indeed allowed ) . since @xmath163",

    "similarly , differentiating ( [ eqhurwitz ] ) @xmath165 times with respect to @xmath166 and arguing as before ( compare also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec .  6 ) ) , we obtain @xmath167    there are some classically unexpected special values like @xmath168      there is an identity for classical sums which is almost never mentioned , because it seems so trivial .",
    "consider the sum @xmath169 obviously , there are two formally correct possibilities to write this sum , @xmath170 classically , it is clear that @xmath171 .",
    "does this carry over to the fractional case ?",
    "there is a fundamental problem : our definition of fractional sums involves @xmath172 , i.e. , @xmath7 is evaluated near @xmath173 , and when @xmath174 is replaced by @xmath175 then @xmath7 would be evaluated near @xmath104 where the values may be unrelated .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "looking back at the axioms given in section  [ sectheaxioms ] , there is one axiom that could possibly be modified : in @xmath17 , limits as @xmath22 are considered , but one could equally well look at limits as @xmath176 .",

    "it can be shown that this definition is the unique one that satisfies axioms ( s1 ) , ( s2 ) , ( s3 ) , ( s4 ) , ( s5 ) , and @xmath177 .",
    "note that in general , the existence of @xmath182 and @xmath183 are independent , and if both left and right fractional sums exist , they may have different values .",

    "what we do have is the obvious relation @xmath186",
    "fractional sums are not simply a new world with results that have no meaning in the classical context ; they allow us to derive identities that can be stated entirely in classical terms .",
    "some of these formulas are known and some seem to be new .",
    "of course , all these identities can in principle be computed without fractional sums . but proving them with the help of fractional sums is rather intuitive and simple , since most of the steps use fractional generalizations of basic , very well - known classical summation properties .      as a first example",
    ", we show how to compute a closed - form expression for the infinite product @xmath187 for @xmath188 .",

    "here is an example of a new identity : using the same steps as in the calculation above , one easily proves that for @xmath200 , @xmath201    resolving the definition and exponentiating , we get the following classical limit identity : @xmath202\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 2^{-\\frac 1 4 \\ln 2 + 4 \\zeta'\\left(-1,\\frac{x+1 } 2\\right)-4\\zeta'\\left(-1,\\frac x 2 + 1\\right ) } \\left (     \\frac{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{x+1 } 2 \\right ) }     { \\gamma\\left(\\frac x 2 + 1\\right ) } \\right)^{-2x\\ln 2}\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\quad e^ {     2 \\zeta''\\left(-1,\\frac x 2 + 1\\right)-2\\zeta''\\left(-1,\\frac{x+1 } 2\\right )     + x\\left (        \\zeta''\\left(0,\\frac { x+1 } 2\\right)-\\zeta''\\left(0,\\frac x 2 + 1\\right )     \\right ) } .\\label{eqcomplicated}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , we have used mathematica for a quick numerical check that is shown in figure  [ fig : secondzeta ] .    ) .",

    "this definition reproduces the classical gamma function : @xmath210 .",

    "thus , we have found an explicit formula for @xmath224 in terms of derivatives of the hurwitz @xmath147 function .",
    "equation  ( [ eqvlnv ] ) gives the special value @xmath225 these are of course very well - known results , but the calculations are strikingly simple .",
    "moreover , this example shows that there is a wide variety of interesting `` special functions '' that do not have to be defined separately , but can be treated in a unified manner by our theory of fractional sums .",

    "again , these formulas have classical limit representations looking like equation  ( [ eqcomplicated ] ) which we do not write down here explicitly .      the paper `` on some strange summation formulas '' @xcite contains some formulas like ( [ eqgosper ] ) below .",
    "there might possibly be very short proofs for all these identities using fractional sums .",
    "the only problem is that there is one single step ( indicated by the question mark ) which we are unable to justify : it is basically an interchange of a fractional sum and an infinite series .",
    "we will now use the basic identity @xmath235 for every @xmath120 and @xmath26 , which can be shown in two different ways : the first possibility is to see that for every @xmath236 , @xmath237 since even and odd terms cancel each other . by continued summation and proposition  [ prop1 ]",
    ", @xmath238 is a polynomial in @xmath3 , so equation  ( [ eqsumxminusx ] ) must be valid for every @xmath120 .",
    "going back to the fractional sum in ( [ eqsb ] ) , the odd function @xmath240 is holomorphic in the entire complex plane , except for a pole at @xmath241 , so we can develop it into a power series .",
