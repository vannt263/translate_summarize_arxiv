    "this isotropy of the percolation threshold , which means that the boolean model either percolates simultaneously in all directions or not at all , can be expected for boolean models for at least three reasons : first , consider the extreme case of aligned rectangles .",
    "a dilation can transform a boolean model with aligned squares into a boolean model with aligned rectangles of arbitrary aspect ratios .",
    "however , the affine transformation neither changes the area fraction nor the topology of the model .",
    "therefore , the percolation threshold for aligned rectangles must be independent of the aspect ratio . moreover , because the model can either be dilated in @xmath0- or @xmath1-direction , the percolation threshold must be isotropic .",
    "balberg and binenbaum  @xcite provide a similar argument for the anisotropic systems of sticks .",
    "they also discuss a renormalization - group argument why in an anisotropic square lattice an isotropic percolation threshold is expected .",
    "another plausibility argument for the isotropic percolation threshold is that , as indicated in section  [ sec : percolation_connectivity ] , percolation in @xmath0-direction is almost surely not possible along a straight line but only along a winded path .",
    "this requires that also grains with different @xmath1-coordinates are connected .",
    "the most fundamental reason for the isotropy of the percolation threshold is that it is closely related to the uniqueness of the percolating cluster in continuum percolation .",
    "meester and roy  @xcite have proven for boolean models of spheres with varying size that there can be at most one unbounded component , but the results can be generalized to grains with general shape , see also @xcite . either with probability one or zero",
    "there is either exactly one or no percolating cluster , in other words , the percolating cluster is ( almost surely ) unique .",
    "similar proofs could be derived for other percolation models  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but not in @xmath1-direction , there would appear with finite probability two percolating clusters ( dark blue and cyan ) not connected to each other ( indicated by the red line that lies wholly in the void phase).,scaledwidth=84.0% ]    the isotropy of the percolation threshold follows by a heuristic argument from the uniqueness of the percolating cluster .",
    "if we assume that the unbounded cluster spans the system only in @xmath0- but not in @xmath1-direction , two percolating clusters that are not connected to each other can appear with finite probability , see figure  [ fig : two_percolating_clusters ] .",
    "assume that the percolating ( dark blue ) cluster is bounded in @xmath1-direction , that is , the cluster lies completely below some bound ( maximum of red line ) . because of the statistical homogeneity of the system , the probability that there is another percolating cluster in the domain above the bound ( colored cyan in figure  [ fig : two_percolating_clusters ] ) should be nonzero",
    ". however , this would lead to a contradiction of the uniqueness of the unbounded cluster .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that in a statistically homogeneous system with almost surely at most one unique unbounded component this percolating cluster must be unbounded both in @xmath0- and in @xmath1-direction , and the percolation thresholds must coincide : @xmath50      the percolation threshold is by plausibility argument and empirical findings confirmed to be isotropic .",
    "so the finite size scaling from ( [ eq : scaling_xy ] ) can be replaced by @xmath51 where the percolation threshold in the infinite system @xmath7 is isotropic .",
    "it is because of the nonuniversal prefactors @xmath52 and @xmath53 that the effective percolation thresholds differ in @xmath0- and @xmath1-direction .     of boolean models with orientation distributions with different degrees of anisotropy ( @xmath12 randomly oriented and @xmath13 aligned rectangles ) as a function of their aspect ratio @xmath42 .",

    "the final results for the isotropic percolation thresholds @xmath7 are plotted in figure  [ fig : percolation_thresholds_isotropic ] .",
    "if the grains are aligned , the percolation threshold does not depend on the aspect ratio of the grains , because in this special case changes in the aspect ratio of the single grains correspond to dilations of the boolean model , as mentioned above .",
    "the latter do not change the topology and therefore not the percolation threshold .",
    "for all other orientation distributions of the grains , the percolation threshold decreases with a decreasing ratio of smaller to larger side length .",
    "put differently , the more elongated a rectangle with rotational degrees of freedom the smaller the percolation threshold . in the limit of stick percolation , that is , for vanishing aspect ratio @xmath54 , the percolation threshold vanishes as well @xmath55 .",
    "comparing different orientation distribution , we find in agreement with previous findings  @xcite , the more anisotropic the orientation distribution , the larger is the percolation threshold .",
    "numerical estimates of the percolation threshold can get computationally very expensive .",
    "however , applications might need the threshold for some specific model parameters for which no simulation results are yet available . a possibility to predict the percolation threshold without the need for expensive simulations",
    "would be of great importance ; that is , an explicit formula approximating the percolation threshold",
    ". such an explicit formula should be easy computable and as accurate as possible  @xcite .",
    "an example is the scaling relation for varying dimensions from @xcite , which is based on a lower bound  @xcite and a conjecture that no convex shape provides higher thresholds than the hyperspheres .",
    "a common approximation is the excluded area approximation ( or excluded volume in three dimensions )  @xcite .",
    "it tries to predict percolation thresholds based on simulation results of similar models by approximating the dependence of the critical intensity on the model parameters by the change in the excluded area .",
    "the excluded area for convex objects can be expressed explicitly by a so - called mixed intrinsic volume from integral geometry . in section  [ sec : excluded - area - approx ] , we compare the approximation of the excluded area to the percolation thresholds for the models with different degrees of anisotropy discussed above .",
    "in contrast to the excluded area approximation , which uses an empirical parameter , mecke and wagner  @xcite suggested a purely geometrical approximation .",
    "it uses an additive topological constant from integral geometry , the euler characteristic . for a compact set",
    ", it is given by the number of connected components minus the number of holes .",
    "the critical intensity is approximated by the zero of its mean value ( as a function of the intensity ) .",
    "the euler characteristic is positive for intensities below this zero and negative above . intuitively speaking ,",
    "this indicates a change from a predominant role of single clusters to a network - like structure .",
    "explicit formulas for the mean euler characteristic are known for very general boolean models  @xcite , that potentially allow for estimates of the percolation threshold .",
    "at least for the parametric boolean models studied here , the approximation is a lower bound , see section  [ sec : euler ] .",
    "we expect it to be a lower bound for even more general boolean models , because the euler characteristic does not distinguish holes in connected clusters from the percolating void phase .    moreover , we find that the trend , i.e. , the qualitative behavior , is very well described by the zero of the euler characteristic . for not too small aspect ratios of the rectangles ,",
    "this finding allows us to very accurately estimate the percolation thresholds of boolean models if the percolation threshold is known for squares that follow the same orientation distribution as the rectangles .",
    "the euler characteristic belongs to a class of so - called minkowski functionals ( or intrinsic volumes ) from integral geometry  @xcite . in two - dimensions ,",
    "the two other minkowski functionals are area and perimeter .",
    "we investigate the potential of further approximations of the percolation threshold that do not use an empirical parameter , namely , the extremal points of the variances and covariances of the minkowski functionals . in section  [ sec_percolation_cov ] , we given an outlook on candidates for close upper bounds on the percolation thresholds .",

    "<S> we examine how the value of the percolation threshold changes with the anisotropy of the system .    in section  [ sec : approx ] , we study analytic approximations of the percolation thresholds based on the excluded area ( section  [ sec : excluded - area - approx ] ) , the euler characteristic ( section  [ sec : euler ] ) , or the second moments of minkowski functionals ( section  [ sec_percolation_cov ] ) . in section  [ sec_conclusion_and_outlook ] , besides concluding remarks , we given an outlook to open problems and generalizations as well as to how our results suggest techniques for future research  @xcite . </S>"
