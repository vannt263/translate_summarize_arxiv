    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) is a unique and powerful observational tool for cosmology ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "it is a small distortion in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum caused by scattering of cmb photons off a distribution of high energy electrons in dense structures such as clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this effect has a unique property that the signal is independent of redshift , making it particularly well suited for deep cluster surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several sze  survey experiments are currently in progress @xcite , and are expected to generate a large sample of sz - selected clusters with masses greater than @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting large samples of galaxy clusters will enable direct measurements of the evolution of the number density of galaxy clusters as a function of redshift and in principle can provide a powerful constraint on the nature of dark energy @xcite .    to utilize the upcoming sze cluster surveys for cosmological studies , it is important to understand the relation between the sze observables and the mass of a cluster .",
    "if the evolution of clusters is dominated by gravitational processes , a simple model of cluster formation and evolution based on the virial theorem @xcite predicts simple power - law relations between cluster masses and certain integrated cluster properties , including the integrated sze flux ( which is proportional to , the integral of the compton-@xmath2 parameter over the solid angle of the cluster ) .",
    "numerical simulations further suggest that  should be an excellent proxy of cluster mass when measured on sufficiently large scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these simulations also predict that the slope and redshift evolution of the sze scaling relations are relatively insensitive to the details of cluster physics , although numerical simulations show that the input cluster physics affects the normalization of the sze scaling relations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate the properties of the sze scaling relations observationally .",
    "previous studies have addressed the correlation between the sze signal and x - ray properties .",
    "for instance , @xcite found a positive correlation between the central sze decrement and the x - ray luminosity in a sample of 14 clusters .",
    "similarly , @xcite detected correlations between the central sze decrement and x - ray determined mass , temperature , and luminosity for a 22 cluster sample , and @xcite for a sample of 24 clusters .",
    "these studies use data from multiple sze and x - ray experiments , making systematics more difficult to control , and focus on the relationship between the central values of the sze signal with the x - ray properties .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the integrated sze flux is a more robust observable than the central values of the sze signal , and found a strong correlation with x - ray temperatures using a sample of 15 clusters obtained by the sunyaev - zeldovich imaging experiment ( suzie , @xcite ) and x - ray temperatures from the _ asca _  experiment .",
    "this paper is the third in a series of papers combining sze and _ chandra _  x - ray measurements of galaxy clusters to study cosmological properties , following @xcite ( b2006 hereafter ) and @xcite ( l2006 hereafter ) .",
    "here we present observational studies of sze scaling relations for clusters of galaxies .",
    "this paper advances the results of previous cluster scaling relation works in several ways .",
    "first , we use the largest observational sample yet constructed (  clusters at redshift @xmath4=0.140.89 ) .",
    "second , our analysis is based on sze and x - ray observations obtained using the same instruments : all sze fluxes are determined using centimeter - wave interferometric data from the bima / ovro sze imaging experiments ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and all cluster x - ray properties are derived using data from the _ chandra _  _ x - ray observatory_. finally , our _ chandra _  observations have an order of magnitude better spatial resolution than the x - ray data used in previous studies , which greatly improves our ability to identify and exclude compact foreground sources which are superimposed on the cluster x - ray emission .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath6=0.3 , @xmath7=0.7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is defined such that @xmath10  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 .",
    "all uncertainties are at the 68.3% confidence level .",
    "in order to establish relationships between mass , sze flux and other cluster properties , one needs to define a radius out to which all quantities will be calculated .",
    "this radius should be physically motivated , reachable with the current x - ray and sze observations , and equivalent for clusters of different redshift .",
    "one candidate is the virial radius . in a friedman - robertson - walker universe ,",
    "an unperturbed spherical region expands indefinitely , while a perturbed overdense region ( the seed of a future cluster ) eventually recollapses .",
    "when the overdense region collapses under the effect of its own gravity , it is assumed to reach virial equilibrium when the radius is half of that at maximum expansion @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the mean cluster density to the background density at the time of virialization is @xmath12 for a universe with critical matter density ( @xmath13 ) . for a different cosmology with @xmath14",
    ", @xcite showed that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as found from a fit to numerical simulations @xcite .    with this characterization of the mean cluster density at time of virialization",
    ", the virial radius can be determined as the radius within which the average density of the cluster is  times the critical density , via    @xmath18    in which both ( @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath4 ) are cosmology dependent , and the critical density @xmath19 is defined as : @xmath20    unfortunately , the virial radius is usually unreachable with current x - ray and sze measurements , and one is forced to perform measurements out to a smaller radius . such a radius ( @xmath21 )",
    "is characterized by the density contrast parameter @xmath22 in place of @xmath23 in equation [ rvir ] , and corresponds to a higher average density , @xmath24 .",
    "we choose a contrast parameter @xmath25 , corresponding to an average density of 2500 times the critical density at the cluster s redshift .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that this is the radius typically reachable with our szeand x - ray data without any extrapolation of the models ( b2006 , l2006 ) .",
    "was shown by @xcite to give results similar to the case of a variable overdensity factor @xmath26 $ ] , in which the variable overdensity scales with redshift in order to keep the ratio of two comoving densities constant . ]",
    "the hierarchical structure formation theory developed by @xcite predicts simple relationships between physical parameters of collapsed structures , known as scaling relations . with the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and of an isothermal distribution for both the dark matter and the cluster gas ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , it can be shown that there is a simple relationship between a cluster s total mass and its gas temperature @xmath27 :    @xmath28    where the mass is calculated out to a radius of mean overdensity @xmath22 , @xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 ) ) , the expected relationship between the gas mass within @xmath32 and the gas temperature is    @xmath33    the compton-@xmath2 parameter is a measure of the pressure integrated along the line of sight : @xmath34 one can further integrate the @xmath2 parameter over the solid angle @xmath35 subtended by the cluster , to obtain the integrated compton-@xmath2 parameter : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the area of the cluster in the plane of the sky . in the context of an isothermal model ,",
    "is proportional to the integral of the electron density @xmath38 over a cylindrical volume , thus @xmath39 in section [ sz - x ] we consider the effect of integrating gas mass within a spherical volume while determining @xmath40 in a cylinder . using equation [ m - t ] we can rewrite equation [ y - da ] in terms of either @xmath41 or @xmath27 , or substitute @xmath42 for @xmath41 , to obtain : @xmath43 equations [ y - t ] are the scaling relations that we investigate observationally in this paper .",
    "we analyze the sze  and x - ray data observations of  clusters in the redshift range @xmath4=0.140.89 , observed with the _ bima _  and _ ovro _  interferometric arrays and with the _ chandra _  x - ray imaging spectrometers .",
    "both data modeling with the isothermal @xmath1 model and the data themselves are presented in b2006 and l2006 , the previous two papers in this series .",
    "we refer to l2006 for details on the observations and data modeling , and to @xcite for a detailed illustration of the modeling of the ovro / bima sze data in the fourier plane . in the following , we review those aspects of the data modeling and analysis that are relevant to the investigation of the scaling relations .",
    "the gas density model is based on the spherical @xmath1-model @xcite , which has the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the central electron number density , @xmath46 is the radius from the center of the cluster , @xmath47 is a core radius , and @xmath1 is a power - law index . when integrated along the line of sight to determine the projected sze decrement distribution ( @xmath48 ) and x - ray surface brightness ( @xmath49 ) , this model has the simple analytic forms @xmath50 where  is the central thermodynamic sze temperature decrement / increment and @xmath51 is the angular core radius of the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this model typically provides a good description of the x - ray surface brightness and sze decrement profiles out to @xmath52(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this simple model , however , does not provide a good description of the peaked x - ray surface brightness observed in the center of some clusters . to minimize the systematic bias associated with modeling of cluster cores , we therefore exclude the central 100  kpc from both the spatial and spectral x - ray data , as was done in the previous two papers in this series .",
    "the emission - weighted x - ray spectroscopic temperature is also determined by a single - temperature fit to the x - ray spectrum of photons extracted from an annulus between 100  kpc and @xmath53 ( l2006 ) .",
    "this 100  kpc - cut model was shown to recover the gas masses of simulated clusters with a range of dynamical states to better than 5% accuracy at  ( l2006 ) and , when applied to the determination of the hubble constant , yielded the same results as a more complex non - isothermal model ( b2006 ) .",
    "uncertainties associated with the isothermal assumption are included via an additional systematic error described in section [ method ] .",
    "following our earlier analysis methods , we do not model the dark matter distribution , and calculate the total mass directly from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( see equation [ eq : mtot_hse_iso ] below ) . an upcoming paper ( mroczkowski et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) will extend the analysis to use more sensitive data from the  @xcite and more accurate modeling of the cluster gas , based on the non - isothermal models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "best - fit model parameters and confidence intervals for all model parameters are obtained using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method described in detail by @xcite and b2006 .",
    "l2006 explains the implementation of the likelihood calculation for the 100  kpc - cut model . for each cluster ,",
    "the markov chain constrains the parameters @xmath54 , @xmath1 , @xmath51 , @xmath55 , @xmath27 , and abundance ( see l2006 for best - fit values ) .",
    "we use the cosmological parameters @xmath8 , @xmath56=0.3 and @xmath7=0.7 to calculate each cluster s angular diameter distance @xmath57 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from these model parameters we calculate  and @xmath58 through the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , @xmath59 in which @xmath60 is the mean molecular weight calculated using the x - ray metallicities and @xmath61 .",
    "one obtains  from the solution of the following equation : @xmath62 in which @xmath19 is given by equation [ rhocrit ] , @xmath25 , and the right hand side is just @xmath58 .",
    "we then compute the global cluster quantities needed for the analysis of sze and x - ray scaling relations .",
    "the gas mass is computed by integrating the gas density model , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mean molecular weight of the electrons , and is the central electron density , obtained from the parameters of the @xmath1 model ( l2006 , equation 12 ) .",
    "the integrated @xmath2 parameter ( , equation [ y - def ] ) is calculated using the measured sze decrement @xmath65 , which is directly proportional to the compton-@xmath2 parameter @xmath66 the factor @xmath67 is the frequency dependence of the sze : @xmath68 in which @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is a small relativistic correction factor . at our observing frequencies , @xmath71 .",
    "thus , @xmath72",
    "our measurements of masses and integrated @xmath2 parameters , using the method described in section [ data ] , are shown in table [ table : results ] .",
    "the errors in table [ table : results ] represent the photon - counting statistical uncertainties of the x - ray data and the statistical uncertainties of the sze observations .",
    "additional sources of uncertainty in the measurement of cluster parameters include cluster asphericity and projection effects , small - scale clumping of the gas , the presence of point sources in the field , cmb anisotropy , the assumption of isothermality , and instrumental calibration , as discussed by @xcite , l2006 , and b2006 .",
    "therefore , in fitting  versus @xmath73 , , and  ( equations [ y - t ] ) , we include an additional statistical error ( combined in quadrature ) of @xmath74% for the masses , and @xmath75% for  and @xmath73 .",
    "we perform a linear least - squares regression in log space , @xmath76 , following the method of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method accounts for errors in both measured parameters for each scaling relation , and it minimizes the @xmath77 statistic defined as @xmath78 in which @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and the linear errors @xmath81 and @xmath82 are obtained from the upper and lower uncertainties around the best - fit values as @xmath83 .",
    "the above derivation of the self - similar scaling relations does not include any variation of the gas fraction with cluster mass",
    ". however , there may be some evidence for such variation in both x - ray observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and simulations @xcite .",
    "we examine this in the present data by performing a logarithmic fit to the -  data using a linear relationship ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "we find no significant evidence for a variation of  with mass ( @xmath86 ) . in the following",
    "we therefore assume that  is a constant .",
    "we then perform similar logarithmic fits to the - , -  and -@xmath84 data .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : scaling ] and in table [ table : scaling ] . under the assumption of a constant ,",
    "all scaling relations are consistent ( within 2@xmath87 statistical uncertainty ) with the simple self - similar model of cluster evolution .",
    "the large number of clusters ( 38 ) and redshift coverage of our _ chandra _  and _ ovro_-_bima _   data ( @xmath88 ) enables the investigation of a possible redshift evolution of the sze scaling relations . for this purpose",
    ", we divide our sample evenly into low - redshift clusters ( @xmath89 , 19 clusters ) and high - redshift clusters ( @xmath90 , 19 clusters ) , and repeat the logarithmic fits of section [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "the results of table [ table : scaling ] indicate no evidence for redshift evolution of the sze scaling relations , as  is consistent with a constant for both low and high - redshift clusters .",
    "furthermore , the sze scaling relations are consistent with the self - similar slopes at or below the 2.5@xmath87 level .",
    "in the previous section we have examined the sze  scaling relations based on quantities derived jointly from sze and x - ray observations . here",
    "we compare the cluster properties derived from our sze observations without using the x - ray data in the fits , in order to determine whether the relations we observe depend strongly on the x - ray information .",
    "we analyze the sze data using the model of section [ model ] , using additional assumptions to provide the constraints that would otherwise be provided by the x - ray data . as a first assumption we fix @xmath91 and fit for @xmath51 and @xmath55 in equation [ eq : easy_sz_signal ] , following l2006 .",
    "the choice of fixing @xmath91 is determined by the fact that this is the median value for our sample ; l2006 also show that using values of 0.6 and 0.8 results in changes to the parameters that are small relative to the 68% statistical uncertainties .",
    "the data quality allows us to perform this sze - only analysis for 25 of the clusters in the full sample , as shown in table [ table : sz - results ] .",
    "knowledge of the gas temperature is required in order to determine , as can be seen from the combination of equations [ rvir ] and [ eq : mtot_hse_iso ] : @xmath92 in the absence of complementary x - ray spectroscopic data , we estimate the gas temperature directly from the sze data following the iterative method described by @xcite .",
    "we first choose an initial estimate of the gas temperature , from which we obtain  and @xmath58 .",
    "we derive @xmath93 using the equations described in section [ subsec : analysis ] , with the central gas density @xmath45 calculated from the parameters of the sze decrement model ( l2006 , equation 13 ) .",
    "we provide a final constraint by assuming that the gas mass fraction of each cluster is equal to the average value for this sample , @xmath94 ( l2006 ) , and iteratively solve the equation @xmath95 in order to find self - consistent estimates of @xmath96 and .",
    "results of the sze analysis are shown in table [ table : sz - results ] . in figure [ x - sz - comparison ]",
    "we compare the sze measurements of gas temperature , , , and gas mass with the values from the joint analysis of section [ data ] . in the joint analysis ,",
    "the x - ray data are solely responsible for the measurement of the temperature , and drive the fit of the spatial parameters and gas density .",
    "they therefore drive the measurements of @xmath53 and @xmath97 as well .",
    "the quantities inferred from the sze data are in good agreement with those from the joint analysis , indicating that we have not altered the scaling relations of section [ sec : scaling ] by incorporating the x - ray data .",
    "although these results show that it is possible to estimate  and the cluster gas mass from the sze data alone , the joint analysis is preferred because it provides the strongest constraints on cluster properties , requires fewer assumptions about the cluster structure and composition , and can be applied to the full 38-cluster sample .",
    "nevertheless , the ability to derive cluster properties from sze observations will be important for the many sze  cluster surveys currently underway @xcite ; these surveys are expected to generate large samples of sze - selected clusters but will not generally have access to deep x - ray observations for cluster characterization . the gas temperature may also be inferred from multi - frequency sze observations @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite indicate that the quantity @xmath98 , the x - ray analogue of , is a low - scatter proxy for the cluster total mass . for the isothermal",
    "@xmath1-model used in this paper , the gas mass can be estimated from x - ray data by using equation [ eq : mgas_single ] , and thus our data also provide a measurement of @xmath99 .",
    "we can therefore compare @xmath40 with @xmath99 , in order to establish observationally whether the two quantities are indeed equivalent . in the case of the isothermal @xmath1-model ,",
    "the integrated compton-@xmath2 parameter is an integral of the electron density over a cylinder @xmath100 of infinite length along the line of sight , and of area @xmath101 : @xmath102 since the gas mass is given by an integral over a sphere @xmath103 of radius @xmath53 , @xmath104 the relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath99 is @xmath105 where the constant @xmath106 accounts for the different domain of integration of @xmath40 and @xmath99 , and depends on the parameters of the @xmath1 model .",
    "we calculate @xmath107 separately for each cluster , and typically find @xmath1082 .    in figure [ y - yx ]",
    "we plot @xmath40 , as derived from the joint sze / x - ray analysis , against @xmath99 .",
    "a fit of the data to the relationship in equation [ eq : y - yx ] ( the dotted line in figure [ y - yx ] , with no degrees of freedom ) results in an acceptable @xmath77 statistic , corresponding to a null hypothesis probability of 80.4% .",
    "the agreement with the relationship in equation [ eq : y - yx ] shows that @xmath99 is an unbiased estimator of the integrated compton-@xmath2 parameter , within the uncertainties of the current measurements .",
    "we compare our results with those of recent cosmological cluster simulations @xcite that include radiative cooling , uv heating , star formation , and stellar feedback processes in addition to the standard gas dynamics . in figure [ daisuke ]",
    "we compare 16 clusters simulated at @xmath4=0 and 0.6 using cooling and star formation feedback processes ( in red ) , the same sets of clusters performed using non - radiative gas dynamics ( in green ) , and our 38 clusters observed with _",
    "chandra _  and",
    "ovro - bima ( in black ) .    the best - fit power - law models that describe the two simulations are shown as dashed lines in figure [ daisuke ] .",
    "a fit of our data to the cooling and star formation model ( red dashed line ) results in a @xmath77 null hypothesis probability of 99.9% , and the non - radiative model ( green dashed line ) has a probability of 0.5% .",
    "the comparison indicates that both simulation models show a similar slope to the observed clusters , with the cooling and star formation feedback model providing a better match to the data .",
    "we have investigated scaling relations between the integrated compton-@xmath2 parameter  and total mass , gas mass , and gas temperature using 38 clusters observed with _",
    "chandra _  and _ ovro_-_bima_. fits of the - , -  and -@xmath84 data to a power - law model agree with the slope predicted by a self - similar model in which the evolution of clusters is dominated by gravitational processes .",
    "the normalization of the -  scaling relation agrees well with the numerical simulations of @xcite , in which collisionless dynamics of dark matter and gas dynamics are complemented by cooling , star formation and feedback phenomena .",
    "the agreement provides observational evidence that non - gravitational phenomena may also be an important factor in the physics of clusters .",
    "the redshift coverage of our sample enabled an analysis of the scaling relations as function of redshift , by defining a low redshift sample ( @xmath109 , 19 clusters ) and a high - redshift sample ( @xmath110 , 19 clusters ) .",
    "both samples follow the prediction based on the self - similar model .",
    "our data indicate no significant evolution in the sze properties of clusters at redshift @xmath111 .",
    "we also measure the cluster mass and integrated y parameter using the sze data alone , without making use of the _ chandra _  spectral and spatial information .",
