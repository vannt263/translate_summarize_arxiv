    "semiconductor processing in industries , plasma etching has been one of the key technologies .",
    "we can categorize the material etching into two types : dry etching and wet etching @xcite .",
    "wet etching employs chemical reactions by liquid to etch materials , which is a relatively low cost process .",
    "however , when the trench size becomes small , it may cause undercut @xcite because etching direction becomes isotropic ( meaning the etching is uniform in all directions ) . on the other hand , dry etching employs charged gases to etch materials .",
    "ion bombardment resulting from acceleration by sheath potential is the primary mechanism for dry etching . by the dry etching , anisotropic etching",
    "can be achieved because the ion bombardment is primarily in one direction .    a capacitively coupled plasma ( ccp ) @xcite is frequently employed for plasma etching .",
    "a ccp can be seen as a plasma bounded by two plates .",
    "one plate with an etching target is connected to the radio frequency ( rf ) bias and the other is grounded .",
    "plasma discharge is sustained by stochastic heating in the sheath @xcite .",
    "when the plasma is generated , a sheath is developed near the material surface .",
    "the sheath accelerates ions and reflects electrons .",
    "sheath formation is the key mechanism for anisotropic ion bombardment . on the other hand , within the trench",
    ", we do not want sheath to be developed in the direction perpendicular to the trench .",
    "otherwise , the ions accelerated by the wall can erode sidewalls of the trench . in this work , the plasma behavior in the trench geometry is investigated by varying its size .",
    "we demonstrate that the trench width need to be smaller than a few debye length .",
    "the industrial trend shows that the etching scale is becoming smaller and smaller to reduce computational power @xcite , and improve memory size . to resolve sub - micron scale ,",
    "one may need to rely on molecular dynamics approach which can be numerically demanding , however . in this work , despite the scale is slightly larger ( than the sub - micron scale ) , we would like to establish a firm ground of self - consistent charged particle dynamics in a trench geometry ; whether ion anisotropy is kept or not . despite seemingly straightforward , particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation @xcite in a realistic two - dimensional trench geometry is not conducted by many authors @xcite .",
    "we consider the plasma discharge based on industrial setting between two plates as in a capacitively coupled plasma and investigate the stable discharge for etching process in the trench geometry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ] , the basic computational model in the presence of kinetic ions and the electrons is described . in section [ s3 ] , a series of two dimensional particle - in - cell simulation , that are in a square geometry , in a periodic square geometry , and finally with the trench geometry , are discussed .",
    "we summarize this work in section [ s4 ] .",
    "in this section , our computational model of two dimensional electrostatic pic simulation is described . in the numerical simulation",
    "we incorporate both the electron and an ion species .",
    "we extend our previous work in @xcite from one dimension to two dimension .    in this paper ,",
    "we denote @xmath0 as the background plasma density and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) as the electron ( ion ) temperature .",
    "we denote @xmath3 and @xmath4 as the mass and the charge of the species ( @xmath5 for electrons and @xmath6 for ions ) , and @xmath7 as the unit charge .",
    "the debye length is given by @xmath8 and the plasma frequency is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "we employ the mks unit in this paper . as in @xcite , after normalizing length by debye length , time by the inverse of plasma frequency @xcite , and the electrostatic potential by @xmath11 , the equations of motion are given by @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 for @xmath5 and @xmath17 for @xmath6 . here ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the coordinates of the configuration space and the velocity space , respectively .",
    "the normalized time variable is given by @xmath20 .",
    "as a reminder the velocities are normalized by the electron thermal velocity @xmath21 .    on the other hand , normalized two dimensional poisson equation is given by ( we normalize densities by @xmath0 ) @xmath22 in ( [ newton1])-([poisson ] ) , all the quantities with `` bar '' denote normalized ones . here ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 while @xmath25 is the electrostatic potential .",
    "for the numerical derivative , we take euler differencing using two mesh points at the boundaries ( central differencing taken , otherwise ) .",
    "in numerically integrating ( [ newton1])-([newton4 ] ) , we employ the leapfrog method @xcite . because @xmath26 and @xmath27 dynamics are independent , we evolve in the order of ( [ newton1 ] ) and ( [ newton2 ] ) , ( [ poisson ] ) , ( [ newton3 ] ) and ( [ newton4 ] ) . in solving two dimensional poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) ,",
    "we employ a gauss - seidel method and a jacobi method .",
    "this is to assure correctness of the solution in the complicated trench geometries first , despite it may not be one of the fastest numerical schemes .",
    "we employ a homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition for the electrostatic potential at one of the electrodes and a time dependent ( an rf like ) dirichlet boundary condition at the other electrode .",
    "in this section , we discuss our numerical simulation results by our newly developed two dimensional pic code . to reach our final goal of simulating a realistic trench geometry , we build our models by verifying from a simple square geometry .",
    "we then impose periodic condition in the direction parallel to the plates ( which we refer to as @xmath27 direction ) , and finally incorporate a trench geometry .",
    "plasma parameters employed in the numerical simulation are : plasma temperature @xmath28 ( the temperature ratio @xmath29 ) and a mass ratio of @xmath30 .",
    "for example , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we obtain @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "all the plasma dynamics in this work is regarded as collisionless .",
    "we first build a pic model for a simple square geometry shown in fig .  1 .",

    ", what we learn is that the control of the anisotropy can be related to the competition of sheath dynamics between two perpendicular directions which are `` @xmath26 '' ( direction toward the plates ) and `` @xmath27 '' ( direction across the trench ) .      as we discussed in [ s1 ] , we are also interested in the effect of charge build - ups on the trench surface @xcite . if ions keep hitting the trench region , it is possible that the trench bottom become positively charged and thus the potential can rise .",

    "the simulation results indicate ions can drift toward the sidewalls when the potential profile is developed in the trench region when the width is larger than a few debye length . to the contrary , anisotropy can be achieved in a relatively small trench size .",
    "furthermore , positive charging up on the trench bottom has been examined .",
    "the numerical simulation result indicates that if we have positive potential due to ions accumulation on the trench bottom , we can lose anisotropy .    to focus on the basic geometrical effects of the trench in the first place , the trench size we dealt in this work are larger than conventional ones ( while our bulk plasma size is comparable to the industrial processing plasmas ) . in the future",
    ", we would like to extend our two dimensional pic simulation to a sub - micron trench with a further speed - up of the numerical computation , the field solver in particular @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "another path is to develop an n - body simulation method ( as in gravitational n - body problems @xcite ) by calculating individual coulomb force between charged particles .    generally , secondary electron emission is not a preferable ingredient for etching .",
    "it causes the sheath instability and enhance power loss @xcite .",
    "however , in the trench region , it is possible that the secondary electron emissions reduce the plasma potential .",
    "ions affected by sidewalls can be reduced .",
    "inclusion of the secondary electron emission effects into our two dimensional model through the ion bombardment @xcite and the electron bombardment @xcite is yet our another near future task .",
