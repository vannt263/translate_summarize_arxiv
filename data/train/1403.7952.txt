    "nacl and kcl are important astrophysical species as they are simple , stable molecules containing atoms of relatively high cosmic abundance .",
    "na , k and cl are the 15th , 20th and 19th most abundant elements in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "in fact nacl could be as abundant as the widely - observed sio molecule @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the first detection of metal halides , nacl , kcl , alcl and , more tentatively , alf , in the circumstellar envelope of carbon star irc+10216 .",
    "these observations have been followed up recently by @xcite , who also observed cs , sio , sis and nacn .",
    "nacl has also been detected in the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen stars ik tauri and vy caris majoris @xcite .",
    "another environment in which these molecules have been found is the tenuous atmosphere of jupiter s moon io .",
    "submillimetre lines of nacl , and more tentatively kcl , were detected by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "nacl has also been identified in the cryovolcanic plumes of saturn s moon enceladus alongside its constituents na and cl @xcite .",
    "k was also detected but the presence of kcl could not be confirmed .",
    "furthermore nacl and kcl are expected to be present in super earth atmospheres @xcite and may form in the observable atmosphere of the known object gj1214b @xcite .",
    "the alkali chlorides are also of industrial importance as they are products of coal and straw combustion .",
    "their presence in coal increases the rate of corrosion in coal fired power plants @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to monitor their concentrations , which can be done spectroscopically provided the appropriate data is available .",
    "the importance of nacl and kcl spectra have motivated a number of laboratory studies , for example @xcite . the most recent and extensive research on kcl and nacl spectra has been performed by @xcite , whom investigated infrared emission lines of na@xmath1cl , na@xmath2cl and @xmath3k@xmath1cl , @xcite , whom measured microwave and millimetre wave lines of @xmath3k@xmath1cl , @xmath3k@xmath2cl , @xmath4k@xmath1cl , @xmath4k@xmath2cl and @xmath6k@xmath1cl , and @xcite , whom recorded microwave and millimetre wave lines of na@xmath1cl and na@xmath2cl .",
    "dipole moment measurements have been carried out by @xcite for na@xmath1cl and na@xmath2cl , @xcite for @xmath3k@xmath1cl and @xmath3k@xmath2cl , and @xcite for @xmath3k@xmath1cl , na@xmath1cl and",
    "na@xmath2cl .    it appears the only theoretical transition line lists for these molecules are catalogued in the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms ) , see @xcite .",
    "they were constructed using data reported in @xcite for nacl , and @xcite for kcl .",
    "the lists are limited to @xmath7 = 4 , @xmath8 = 159 and do not include a list for @xmath4k@xmath2cl . in this paper",
    "we aim to compute more comprehensive line lists for the previously studied isotopologues and the first theoretical line list for @xmath4k@xmath2cl .",
    "the exomol project aims to provide line lists on all the molecular transitions of importance in the atmospheres of planets .",
    "the aims , scope and methodology of the project have been summarised by @xcite .",
    "lines lists for x  @xmath9 xh molecules , x = be , mg , ca , and x  @xmath10 sio have already been published ( @xcite respectively ) . in this paper , we present ro - vibrational transition lists and associated spectra for two nacl and four kcl isotopologues .",
    "the nuclear motion schrdinger equation allowing for born - oppenheimer breakdown ( bob ) affects , is solved for species xcl using program level @xcite . to initiate these calculations , program dpotfit @xcite",
    "was used to generate a refined potential energy curve ( pec ) for each molecule by fitting _ ab initio _",
    "curves to laboratory data .",
    "the most comprehensive and accurate sets of available laboratory measurements are the infrared ro - vibrational emission lines of @xcite and the microwave rotational lines of @xcite and @xcite all of which were recorded at temperatures in the region of 1000 c , see table  [ tab : obsdata ] . for kcl fourier transform infrared emission spectra measured by @xcite",
    "has been re - analysed and re - assigned as part of this work , see section 2.2 .",
    "the dunham constants ( y@xmath5 ) obtained from this new fit are provided in table  [ tab : dunham ] .",
    "ro - vibrational emission lines derived from this were used in place of those presented by @xcite because of problems found in the previous analysis .",
    "@xcite reported spectroscopic constants derived from an infrared emission spectrum of kcl recorded with a high resolution fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) . by using the new constants derived from the millimetre wave spectrum by @xcite to simulate the infrared spectrum of @xmath3k@xmath1cl with pgopher @xcite , it was clear that @xcite had mis - assigned much of the complex spectrum .",
    "the @xcite spectrum was therefore re - analyzed .",
    "as a first step , the millimetre wave line list from @xcite was refitted with the addition of two dunham parameters , y@xmath11 and y@xmath12 .",
    "these parameters were found to improve the quality of the fit .",
    "the @xcite constants plus y@xmath11 and y@xmath12 were then used to calculate band constants used as input for pgopher .",
    "using pgopher the infrared line positions were selected manually and then refitted along with the caris data using our lsq fit program .",
    "there were 253 r branch lines of @xmath3k@xmath1cl fit from the 6 - 5 , 5 - 4 , 4 - 3 , 3 - 2 , 2 - 1 , and 1 - 0 bands , and the y@xmath13 , y@xmath14 and y@xmath15 vibrational constants were added . the quality of the observed spectrum was insufficient to fit additional bands or p branch lines .",
    "the final constants from our global fit are compared to the values reported by @xcite in table  [ tab : dunham ] .",
    "the y@xmath13 and y@xmath14 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) constants of @xcite were derived entirely from millimetre wave data using dunham relationships and are in good agreement with the values we have determined directly from infrared observations .",
