    "widespread usage of mobile devices , together with the emergence of social - based services and applications , have inspired novel and self - organized networking paradigms that capitalize on the ability of mobile devices to connect and share information in an ad - hoc fashion .",
    "contemporary networks , where users produce and exchange information , are  socio - technological \" in nature ; users do not necessarily exploit an exogenously designed network infrastructure , but rather form an endogenous network driven by the individual users quest for information . in this paper , we present a novel network formation model for information exchange over endogenously formed networks",
    ". albeit being abstract , our model provides insights into understanding and designing many emerging and envisioned classes of applications .",
    "many emerging networks are formed endogenously by self - interested agents , who take information sharing and production actions .",
    "examples of such networks are : dynamic spectrum management by wireless users @xcite , social networks overlaid on technological networks @xcite @xcite , device - to - device ( d2d ) communications , vehicular networks @xcite , internet - of - things ( iot ) @xcite , and smart sensor networks @xcite . in many of these networks ,",
    "users connect to each other in order to exchange and gather information .",
    "for instance , secondary users exchange information about spectrum occupancy in cognitive radio networks @xcite @xcite , autonomous rescue robots exchange environmental sensory information @xcite @xcite , d2d users engage in short range communications in order to exchange data content of social networks services ( snss ) @xcite , and self - interested users take capacity allocation decisions for multicast streaming over networks @xcite .",
    "users in such networks possess two key features : they are _ opportunistic _ , in the sense that they exploit their opportunistic encounter with other mobile users to establish short - range communication links with them , and they are _ cognitive _ , in the sense that they need to reason about establishing costly communication links with others given the value of information they can get via these links .",
    "information in this context is an abstraction for any class of data that users gather and process , such as multi - modal content , geographical information , event - related information , cached content , behavioral data , and personal sensory information @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for instance , mobile users who coexist in close proximity can share information about traffic congestion and road accidents which helps them update their routes via applications such as waze and google maps , and d2d users can gather offloaded traffic of context - aware applications from other users by forming short - range communications links @xcite .",
    "moreover , information can also be produced by the agents themselves in the form of user - generated content , such as the upload and creation of blogs , videos and photos on online social networks ( osn ) , the purchase of content from service providers in peer - to - peer networks , updating traffic information via an application such as waze , etc .",
    "thus , users in such networks can jointly decide how much information should they produce , and how much information should they opportunistically acquire from other users .",
    "as it is whenever users are self - interested , a game - theoretic framework is naturally deployed to study which networks will emerge at equilibrium and what are their characteristics . network formation has been studied in the economics , electrical engineering and computer science literature . in the following subsection ,",
    "we briefly review these related works on endogenous network formation .",
    "strategic network formation was first studied in the economics literature . some of this literature @xcite-@xcite asks which networks are stable ( according to some criteria ) and hence more likely to persist and be observed .",
    "a ( smaller ) literature asks which networks emerge as the result of some specific dynamic process @xcite @xcite . in all these works ,",
    "simplistic benefit functions are used : the value of each additional  good \" exchanged is constant @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , in realistic settings , information possessed by different agents can be redundant or complementary .",
    "for instance , secondary users in a multi - band cognitive radio system may be interested in gathering information about spectrum occupancy for bands that they do not sense by communicating with other users who do sense these bands @xcite ; sensors deployed over a correlated random field @xcite-@xcite may be interested in gathering complementary measurements about some set of physical processes of interest ; and mobile users who exchange offloaded traffic of snss and context - aware applications are only interested in gathering non - redundant traffic and data updates .",
    "this paper introduces a new model for strategic network formation where autonomous cognitive agents exchange valuable information .",
    "we refer to such networks as _ cognitive information networks _",
    "( cin ) ; networks in which agents self - organize to gather / exchange and produce information about a state of the world .",
    "this state of the world can be spectrum occupancy information and primary user activity in a multi - band cognitive radio system , location information provided by anchors of wireless networks , a set of messages sent by information sources in a multicast network , or blogs , videos , and data exchanged by users of social - physical networks .",
    "agents are _ cognitive _ since they _ perceive _ information possessed by other agents , _ reason _ about which links to establish , how much information to produce , and then take information production and link formation _ decisions _ which result in an endogenously - formed network topology .",
    "we assume that agents in a cin possess different amounts of information , benefit only from gathering non - redundant information , and they form links with each other in order to gather information and maximize their _ knowledge _ of the state of the world .    since the information possessed by different agents may be correlated ( redundant ) , and link formation is costly , agents should cognitively select _ which _ agents to link with .",
    "we formulate this problem as a _ non - cooperative network formation game_. using information - theoretic measures for the value of the information possessed by each agent , we aim at characterizing the emerging stable network topologies at nash equilibrium ( ne ) . throughout our analysis ,",
    "we focus on two classes of linking cost scenarios : homogeneous link formation cost and heterogeneous link formation costs . in",
    "the former , connecting to any agent entails the same cost , while in the later , the link cost is recipient - dependent .",
    "the link cost can correspond to tokens @xcite @xcite , or an abstraction for any monetary , energy , or delay costs incurred by the agent forming the link .",
    "an agent in the network is an abstraction for a mobile user , a mobile device , or a transmitter / receiver that is rational and self - interested .",
    "we show that the networks that emerge at equilibrium are minimally connected ; thus , agents tend to minimize the overall cost of constructing the network . with homogeneous link costs",
    ", equilibrium leads to a network in which each component is a star .",
    "moreover , we show how information redundancy affects the link cost ranges at which the network becomes connected or disconnected , in addition to its impact on the network efficiency by quantifying the price - of - anarchy ( poa ) .",
    "for instance , we show that for networks with low link costs , when the link costs are homogeneous , all emerging networks are efficient ; in contrast , information redundancy can induce costly anarchy in networks with heterogeneous link costs .",
    "finally , we consider a setting in which each agent will not only decide which links to form , but also the amount of information to produce and we provide a characterization for the emerging ne .",
    "we show that when the number of agents is large , the fraction of agents producing information at equilibrium depends on the amount of redundancy in the agents information .",
    "when the agents produce strongly correlated information , the fraction of information producers is small and tends to zero as the number of agents tends to infinity : most agents get the information they need from a small set of agents . on the other hand ,",
    "when agents have uncorrelated information , the number of information producers can grow at the same rate of total number of agents .",
    "thus , such networks violate what galeotti and goyal @xcite call the  _ law of the few _ \" .",
    "in addition , we quantify the total amount of information produced in an asymptotically large network and identify scenarios in which the amount of information produced at equilibrium grows with the number of agents .",
    "this paper introduces a new model for cognitive agents exchanging information / knowledge and studying what networks emerge endogenously as a result of self - organizing cognitive agents .",
    "since many applications can use the presented model , we do not delve on the idiosyncratic details of specific applications .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formalize the network formation game among agents in a cin . section iii characterizes the emerging stable networks when the link formation costs are homogeneous , and the efficiency of such networks are investigated .",
    "section iv analyzes the network topology and equilibrium efficiency for the case of heterogeneous link costs . the joint information production and link formation game",
    "is studied in section v. suggested future extensions for our model are provided in section vi .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section vii .",
    "in this section , we discuss the problem setting and propose a basic model to formulate the endogenous network formation game emerging among cognitive agents .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of agents in the cin .",
    "each agent @xmath1 possesses exogenous information in the form of a discrete random variable @xmath2 and aims to form links with other agents to maximize its utility , which is defined as the benefit from the total information it possesses minus the linking cost .",
    "the formation of links is costly ; thus , an agent has to trade off the benefits of the information it obtains from another agent versus the cost it needs to pay for connecting with that agent .",
    "the amount of information in @xmath2 is quantified by the _ entropy _",
    "function @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the random variables of all agents may be correlated , which indicates that some agents may possess similar information that is redundant to that of the other agents .",
    "the common information between agent @xmath1 and @xmath4 is captured by the _ mutual information _ @xmath5 .",
    "the information possessed by the set of agents @xmath6 is captured by an _ entropic vector _ that we define as follows .",
    "* entropic vector- * a vector @xmath7 is said to be an entropic vector of order @xmath8 if there exists a random variable tuple @xmath9 , where associated with any subset @xmath10 of @xmath6 , there is a joint entropy @xmath11 that is an element of @xmath7 , where @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the elements of @xmath7 represent the joint entropies between all possible subsets of random variables possessed by agents in @xmath6 .",

    "in particular , the kl divergence of @xmath46 from @xmath47 is equal to the difference between the amount of information possessed jointly by the agents , and the corresponding amount of information possessed by the same agents if such information has no redundancies . throughout the paper",

    "moreover , the aggregate information can be expressed in terms of the mutual information as @xmath73 where the term @xmath74 represents the net information that agent @xmath1 acquires after connecting to the agents in @xmath75 , where the term @xmath76 captures the redundancy between the information of agent @xmath1 and the information it acquires from the set @xmath77 .",

    "the network is fully disconnected and the amount of information possessed by each agent @xmath1 is @xmath3 ( no information is shared ) .",
    "see appendix c.    from the above lemma , we can see that three factors affect the connectivity of a network : the link cost , the amount of information possessed by each agent , and the redundancies among the agents information .",
    "based on the result of lemma 1 , we define three regions for the connectivity of the ne networks based on the link cost as follows :    * _ connected agents region _ ( @xmath140 ) : a network with an entropic vector @xmath7 has a single component when the link cost is @xmath135 .",
    "* _ isolated agents region _ ( @xmath141 ) : the network has @xmath8 components when the link cost is @xmath138 . *",
    "_ mixed region _ ( @xmath142 ) : depending on the entropic vector , the network can have different number of components ranging from 1 to @xmath8 when the link cost is @xmath143 .    while the connectivity regions describe the impact of link cost on network topology , they also have informational significance .",
    "for instance , the amount of information possessed by any agent in the @xmath140 region is @xmath137 , while in the @xmath141 region , no agent @xmath1 gathers any extra information other than its own intrinsic information @xmath3 . on the other hand , agents in the @xmath142 region can end up gathering different amounts of information as there are potentially multiple equilibria with different topologies and connectedness . in the following illustrative example , we demonstrate the impact of the link cost and information redundancy on the network s connectivity regions .    to illustrate the impact of information redundancy and link cost on the ne networks connectivity , we plot the @xmath142 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 regions in the link cost - information redundancy plane for 2 different families of entropic vectors .",
    "assume that we have a 3-agent cin , with @xmath128 , and @xmath144 , and that agent 1 has non - redundant information , i.e. the random variable @xmath97 is independent on @xmath98 and @xmath145 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath146 .",
    "we consider two different families of entropic vectors ( i.e. two different assignments for the values of individual agents entropies ) , the first is given by @xmath147 , whereas the second is given by @xmath148 . the connectivity regions associated with entropic vector family @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath149 .",
    "an exemplary utility function of @xmath150 is used . in fig .",
    "2 , we plot the connectivity regions in the cost - kl divergence plane for the 2 families of entropic vectors . for both families of entropic vectors ,",
    "the @xmath142 region shrinks as the information redundancy increases .",
    "that is , when agents share more information in common , the ne network connectivity becomes less  uncertain \" since the @xmath142 region ( which is the only region with potentially multiple equilibria with different levels of connectivity ) in this case will correspond to a limited range of link costs .",
    "moreover , we note that for the first family of entropic vectors , when agents 2 and 3 information are fully redundant ( i.e. @xmath151 ) , we have a sharp threshold on the link cost , below which we have a connected network , and above which we have a fully disconnected network ( i.e. the @xmath142 region is empty ) .",
    "the intuition behind this is that since agents 2 and 3 are fully  correlated \" , they only benefit from connecting to agent 1 .",
    "thus , agent 1 acts as the only information source , and it is the benefit from getting agent s 1 information that solely determines the cost at which the network would be connected or not . if agents 2 and 3 information are not redundant , they add value to the network , and the cost thresholds become dependent on their information as well",
    ". however , for the second family of entropic vector , since there is more heterogeneity in the amount of information possessed by the agents , no single agents monopolizes the information at any value of the kl divergence , thus the @xmath142 region does not vanish for the second vector for any value of @xmath133 .",
    "while lemma 1 focuses on the impact of link cost on the connectivity of the network , it does not provide a complete characterization for an ne network . in the next theorem ,",
    "we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of an arbitrary cin topology in ne .        a network in which the components are precisely @xmath152 can be supported in a ne if and only if the following relationships between the cost and the value of information are satisfied    1 .",

    "2 .   @xmath155 .",
    "see appendix d.    from theorem 2 we know that , at ne , the network is generally composed of multiple components and each component is minimally connected .",
    "each component possesses a set of random variables that are jointly highly correlated to the joint random variables possessed by other components .",
    "condition ( 1 ) in theorem 2 implies that each agent in a component either benefits from forming a link to some other agent in that component , or other agents benefit from linking to it , while condition ( 2 ) implies that agents in different components have no incentives to connect to agents in other components .",
    "note that due to indirect information sharing , many equilibria can exist with highly variant topologies .",

    "a network is a strict ne if and only if the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied    * all conditions stated in theorem 2 are satisfied . * for each component @xmath62 of size @xmath156 , there exists a set @xmath157 with @xmath158 such that @xmath159 * each non - singleton component forms a core - sponsored star topology , where the periphery agents belong to the set @xmath160",
    ".    see appendix e.    this theorem states that for homogeneous link formation costs , each network component of size @xmath161 comprises a single agent bearing the cost of getting connected to @xmath162 other agents .",
    "such networks exhibit a _",
    "core - periphery _ structure , i.e. a single agent at the core is connected to a set of @xmath162 periphery agents .",
    "the conditions in theorem 3 state that the periphery agents must be _ high entropy _ agents .",
    "this is because the benefit obtained by connecting to a periphery agent @xmath4 at equilibrium must exceed the cost , i.e. @xmath163 . the intuition behind this condition is as follows .",
    "for an agent to be a periphery agent , it must have both high entropy and low redundancy with the information possessed by other component members such that core agents have an incentive to form a link with it .",

    ", we study the efficiency of the ne networks and compare the self - organized cins to those designed by a network planner .",
    "the goal of this subsection is to investigate the equilibrium efficiency of @xmath94 with homogeneous link costs by quantifying the poa and the mil .",
    "we start by quantifying the poa of cins in the following lemma .    for a cin with homogeneous link costs ,",
    "the price - of - anarchy satisfies @xmath164 and @xmath165    see appendix f.    this lemma shows that all ne networks in the @xmath140 and @xmath141 regions are socially optimal . while in the @xmath140 region multiple equilibria exist , they all have the same social welfare of @xmath166 . however , in the @xmath142 region the ne networks may not be socially optimal , and we give an upper bound on the poa . when all agents possess non - redundant information , the poa is upper bounded by @xmath8 , whereas when agents possess redundant information , we have @xmath167 , which gives an indication that information redundancy reduces the poa in the @xmath142 region .",
    "while the social welfare captures the sum utilities , it does not quantify the individual losses by agents . in the next corollary",
    ", we quantify the mil for different connectivity regions .    for a cin with homogeneous link cost ,",
    "the mil satisfies @xmath168 and @xmath169    see appendix g.    fig .",
    "x depicts the poa for a 3-agent cin with the first family of entropic vectors defined in illustrative example 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the poa is greater than 1 only in the @xmath142 region .",
    "in addition , the poa decreases as the kl divergence increases , since the value of information in the network decreases , which means that the best equilibrium ( connected network ) achieves a smaller social welfare while the welfare of the worst equilibrium ( fully disconnected network ) is independent of the kl divergence .",
    "the poa also decreases as the link cost increases . from fig .",
    "x , we can see that when @xmath170 , the network exhibit an empty @xmath142 region , i.e. the network changes from a connected to a fully disconnected network if the cost exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "thus , for @xmath170 the network is robust to efficiency loss for all values of link cost as the @xmath142 region is the only region where efficiency loss can occur .",
    "x depicts the mil upper bound for the same network .",
    "it is also observed that the mil upper bound decreases monotonically with the increasing information redundancy .",
    "in this section , we extend the analysis done in the previous section for the game @xmath94 , but assuming that the cost of link formation is exclusively recipient - dependent , i.e. @xmath171 .",
    "it is easy to show that proposition 1 applies to the case of heterogeneous link costs , i.e. all network components that satisfy the ne conditions are minimally connected .",
    "the following proposition relates the link costs to the connectivity of the ne networks .",
    "a.   if @xmath172 , then , at every ne ( a ) the network is minimally connected ( the network has one component ) and ( b ) the amount of information possessed by each agent is @xmath137 ( all information is shared ) . b.   if @xmath173 where @xmath174 , then there is a unique ne which is strict . at this equilibrium ,",
    "the network is fully disconnected and the amount of information possessed by each agent @xmath1 is @xmath3 ( no information is shared ) .",
    "this can be proven straightforwardly using the same arguments in the proof of lemma 1 .",
    "this proposition shows that the network topology is highly dependent on the heterogeneity of the agents as it depends both on the heterogeneous costs and heterogeneous information of agents .",
    "also the case when all ne networks are connected corresponds to the @xmath140 region in the homogeneous cost scenario , while the case when the ne is a fully disconnected network corresponds to the @xmath141 region .",
    "an appropriate definition for the connectivity regions for the heterogeneous cost case is given by ( [ moddef1 ] ) , ( [ moddef2 ] ) , and ( [ moddef3 ] ) .    @xmath175 @xmath176 @xmath177    in the following theorem , we give a generic characterization for this class of networks in ne .    a network in which the components are precisely @xmath152 can be supported in a ne if and only if the following relationships between the cost and the value of information are satisfied    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath179 , @xmath154 .",
    "this can be proven following the same idea for the proof of theorem 2 .",

    ", we analyze the efficiency of the ne networks .      in this subsection",
    ", we quantify the impact of the link costs heterogeneity on the network efficiency . unlike the case of the homogeneous link costs , we show that information redundancy induces costly anarchy in the @xmath140 region when the link costs are recipient - dependent . in the following lemma , we quantify the poa for the @xmath140 and @xmath141 regions .    for a cin with heterogeneous link costs ,",
    "the poa satisfies @xmath180 and @xmath181    see appendix h.    thus , unlike in the homogeneous cost scenario , not all ne networks in the @xmath140 region are socially optimal .",
    "in fact , any ne network other than a _ periphery - sponsored _ star with the agent having the lowest link cost residing in the core , is not socially optimal .",
    "how does information redundancy affect the poa in such networks ? the following theorem answers this question .    for a cin with recipient - dependent link costs in the @xmath140 region and for fixed values of the individual agents entropies ,",
    "the price - of - anarchy is a monotonically increasing function of the total information redundancy .",
    "see appendix i.    thus , in stark contrast with the results obtained for the homogeneous cost cins , theorem 5 states that information redundancy induces costly anarchy for a network in @xmath140 region .",
    "this results from the heterogeneity of the link formation costs , which promotes anarchy in the network as agents are no longer indifferent to the links they form as in the homogeneous cost scenario . as a matter of fact",
    ", some agents may end up forming  expensive \" links and getting the same amount of information that they could have gathered by forming a  cheaper \" link . when information redundancy increases , the value of the information gathered by agents decreases , thus , anarchy costs more and the poa increases .",
    "contrarily , in the @xmath142 region , the upper bound on poa decreases as the information redundancy increases in a similar manner to the homogenous link costs scenario . unlike the poa , the mil upper bound is not sensitive to cost heterogeneity since it is only sensitive to informational losses .",
    "it can be easily shown that the mil in recipient - dependent cins behaves in the same way as in the homogeneous cost scenario . in the next section",
    ", we tackle the problem of joint information production and link formation in cins .",
    "in the network formation game so far , we have assumed that agents in a cin are gifted with an exogenously determined entropic vector .",
    "nevertheless , in many practical cins , agents decide the amount of information to  produce \" given some production cost , e.g. mobile users in cellular systems may download data for social - based services by themselves via the cellular network infrastructure , or get this data opportunistically from other users by establishing d2d links @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we focus on a cin where each agent jointly decides the amount of information to produce and the links to form .",
    "when agents choose what information to produce , a crucial aspect that affects the network topology and information production is how information aggregates .",
    "@xcite assumes that information aggregates simply by addition ; this will be the case only if the value of each additional piece of information is constant ; thus , there are no complementarities nor redundancies .",
    "@xcite assumes a specific functional form , the _ dixit - stiglitz _ function ; this captures informational complementarities and redundancies in a very special way , i.e. agents appreciate",
    " diversity of information sources \" rather than the  diversity of the information \" . in this paper",
    ", we consider two modes of aggregation that seem more natural and are suggested by the formulation of information in terms of entropy .",
    "the information production decision taken by @xmath8 agents in a cin corresponds to the selection of a point inside the entropic region @xmath18 .",
    "correlations between the random variables of different agents are exogenously determined by external factors , e.g. geographical locations of sensors . to capture information redundancy",
    ", we define an aggregation function @xmath182 that maps the entropies of a set of agents to a joint entropy of these agents , i.e. @xmath183 .",
    "clearly , the range of the function @xmath184 should belong to @xmath18 . throughout this section ,",
    "we study two different aggregation functions : the first is the one corresponding to independent random variables @xmath16 , and the second is the one corresponding to strongly correlated random variables @xmath185 .",
    "both aggregation functions provide insights on how information redundancy affects the information production decisions at equilibrium .    in real - world networks ,",
    "the aggregation function captures the informational relationships between different agents in a cin .",
    "for instance , in a sensor network where sensors are deployed over a correlated random field @xcite , the information production decision can be thought of as the precision at which a sensor quantizes its measurements .",
    "larger precision corresponds to larger value for the entropy .",
    "however , no matter what precision a sensor uses , its measurements will be correlated to that of another nearby sensor .",
    "thus , the joint entropy of the two sensors would be governed not only by the precision they decide , but also by the redundancy in their information that is determined exogenously by their geographical locations and the nature of the physical process that they sense .",
    "the aggregation function captures such exogenous factors , and based on it , the behavior of cognitive agents is determined .    in the information production and link formation game , the strategy of an agent @xmath1",
    "is denoted by @xmath186 .",
    "a strategy profile of the game is written as @xmath187 , and the strategy space is @xmath188 .",
    "we denote the joint information production and link formation game by @xmath189 .",
    "thus , different from @xmath94 , agents do not observe an entropic vector , but they decide the entropic vector based on their knowledge of the aggregation function .",
    "the utility function of agent @xmath1 is given by @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the cost of producing one unit of information , @xmath192 is the number of agents which agent @xmath1 form links with , and @xmath193 is determined by @xmath194 given the production levels of all agents .",

    "we observe that agent @xmath296 can break this link and still receive the same benefit by gathering the same amount of information from path @xmath293 , thus receiving a strictly higher utility function as it will not pay the cost for the link with agent @xmath305 , which contradicts with the fact that @xmath306 is an ne .",
    "thus , a single path exists between any two agents .",

    "if this condition is satisfied for all agents , then the network is indeed disconnected , and part ( ii ) of the lemma follows .",

    "otherwise , this agent can get disconnected ( by having this agent breaking a link or other agents break their links with that agent ) from the component while strictly increasing its utility or the utility of other agents in the component .",
    "thus , we must have either @xmath312 or @xmath313 for all agents @xmath4 in @xmath311 .",
    "this should apply to all components in the network .",
    "hence , condition ( 1 ) follows .",
    "now focus on the interaction between different components of the network . if any agent in component @xmath311 benefits from forming a link to any agent in component @xmath314 , then the network is not ne since in this case an agent in @xmath311 can strictly increase its utility by unilateral deviation .",
    "hence , we should have @xmath315 for any two components in the network .",
    "thus , condition ( 2 ) follows .",
    "when the three conditions in theorem 3 are satisfied , then the network is a strict ne since the action of each agent is strictly better than any other action , i.e. core agents in each component strictly better off when sponsoring the periphery agents , and all the periphery agents strictly better off when they do not form any links .",
    "thus , no agent is indifferent to multiple actions , which implies that the ne is strict .",

    "thus , we conclude that @xmath322 .",

    "note that conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in theorem 2 should also be satisfied for the network to be an ne , while the feasibility of organizing each component as a core - sponsored star guarantees that the network is at strict ne .",
    "thus , strict ne exists if there exists an ne with the set @xmath160 having a cardinality that is not less than @xmath162 for all components , i.e. a single core agent can sponsor each component .",

    "recall that in the @xmath140 region , we have @xmath330 .",
    "thus , for any ( disconnected ) network with less than @xmath326 links , the social welfare can always be increased by adding a set of links that makes the network ( minimally ) connected . on the other hand , we know from the pigeonhole principle that any network with more than @xmath326 has cycles , thus the social welfare can always be increased by breaking a set of links such that all cycles are eliminated while keeping the network minimally connected .",

    "we compute an upper bound on the poa .",
    "the lowest social welfare of any equilibrium network in the @xmath141 region is lower bounded by @xmath335 , i.e. @xmath336 , with equality when @xmath337 , and @xmath338 ( i.e. , agents do not get immediate benefit from forming links to individual agents , thus a fully disconnected network is an ne since not forming a link is a best response for all agents in a fully disconnected network ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the social welfare of the socially optimal network in the @xmath142 region is upper bounded by @xmath329 , i.e. the social welfare is always strictly less than the sum benefit of all agents when they possess all the information in the network .",

    "for a connected network in the @xmath140 region , the utility of agent @xmath1 is given by @xmath348 .",
    "the social welfare is given by @xmath349 . since we know from proposition 1 that the network is minimally connected at equilibrium , then it has exactly @xmath326 links .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath350 , where @xmath351 is the set of links in the network designated by the index of link recipient , and @xmath352 .",
    "the social optimal topology is the connected network with minimum total link costs , which corresponds to a periphery - sponsored star with the agent @xmath353 residing in the core of the star .",
    "the social welfare of such topology is @xmath354 .",
    "note that this is also an ne equilibrium as each agent does not benefit from breaking its link with the core agent and linking to any other periphery agents .",
    "next , we identify the equilibrium with the worst social welfare .",
    "assume that the link costs are arranged ascendingly as @xmath355 .",
    "we know that the network is minimally connected , thus total costs of link formation is given by @xmath356 .",
    "what are the elements of the set @xmath351 such that the total cost is maximized and the network is at equilibrium ?",
    "note that for the socially optimal profile , @xmath357 , with a cardinality of @xmath326 . now assume a line network with @xmath358 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath359 .",
    "thus , @xmath360 .",
    "it can be easily shown that this line network is stable , since no agent @xmath1 can break its link with agent @xmath361 and increase its utility .",
    "for instance , if @xmath1 breaks its link with @xmath361 , it must connect to any agent @xmath362 to receive the same amount of information but at a higher cost .",
    "it can be also shown that this is the worst equilibrium .",
    "this is because for a connected network , only one agent @xmath1 connects to the agent @xmath8 with the highest link cost , and others can connect to @xmath1 ( which has a lower link cost ) and get the information of @xmath8 via indirect sharing .",
    "the same applies to agent @xmath326 , where one agent connects to it , and others share information by connecting to that agent .",
    "thus , to maximize the total link cost and maintain equilibrium , only one link is formed with each agent except the one with the minimum link cost .",
    "thus , the social welfare in this case is @xmath363 , and the poa formula follows .    for the @xmath141 and @xmath142 regions ,",
    "the proof is the same as that of lemma 2 .",
    "in the @xmath140 region , the poa can be written as @xmath364 .",
    "it can be easily shown that if the kl divergence varies from @xmath365 to @xmath366 , where @xmath367 and the values of the individual agents entropies are fixed , then the poa increases , i.e. we have @xmath368 .",
    "we start with the case of @xmath212 .",
    "assume that there exists a link in @xmath306 with @xmath316 . in this case , agent @xmath1 can always better off by breaking this link and producing an amount @xmath197 of information .",
    "this applies to any agent @xmath1 in @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we have a unique equilibrium with @xmath369 , and @xmath235 , @xmath370 .",
    "now focus on the case of @xmath215 .",
    "we show that if @xmath371 satisfies ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) , then @xmath371 is an ne .",
    "the minimality of each network component can be easily proved using proposition 1 .",
    "now we show that the connected network is an ne . in a disconnected network ,",
    "an agent has to produce an amount @xmath197 of information , which is not optimal since @xmath215 .",
    "thus , no agent in a connected network has incentive to break its link and part ( i ) follows .",
    "since the network is minimally connected , then each agent obtains all the total amount of information @xmath137 . if @xmath372 , then no agent in the component has incentive to alter their information production profile because all agents benefit only from obtaining an amount @xmath197 of information",
    "thus , part ( ii ) is proved . finally , if @xmath373 , then no agent in the network has incentive to break the link it forms and produce an amount @xmath374 of information on its own .",
    "thus , @xmath371 is a nash equilibrium .",
    "we now prove the converse .",
    "let @xmath371 be an equilibrium .",
    "assume that the network has two components @xmath375 and @xmath376 . the total amount of information in each component",
    "must be @xmath197 at equilibrium , thus , any agent with positive amount of information production in one component will better off by not producing any information and forming a link to the other component .",
    "thus , the network is connected in ne and part ( i ) follows . due to indirect information sharing , part ( ii )",
    "is directly concluded .",
    "finally , if @xmath371 is an equilibrium and @xmath377 , then this should be optimal for agent @xmath1 , thus @xmath378 .",
    "the case of @xmath212 is exactly the same as in theorem 6 and the proof will be similar to that in appendix j. now focus on the case of @xmath215 .",
    "we show that if @xmath371 satisfies ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) , then @xmath371 is an ne . part ( i ) follows from proposition 1 and the proof of theorem 6 .",
    "now assume that only one agent in the network produces @xmath197 information and all others do not produce any information and only form links in the network .",
    "in this case , the agent producing information does not better off by producing any amount of information other than @xmath197 .",
    "in addition , the agents forming links do not better off by forming new links or breaking their links and producing information since @xmath215 . thus , part ( ii ) follows .",
    "since there are @xmath326 agents forming links , then the network is connected , and no agent benefits from forming an extra link in the network , which concludes part ( iii ) .",
    "we now prove the converse .",
    "let @xmath371 be an equilibrium .",
    "due to indirect information sharing , part ( i ) follow straightforwardly .",
    "assume that we have two agents with @xmath379 , then agent @xmath4 can always better off by setting @xmath380 since the aggregate information of @xmath1 and @xmath4 is @xmath381 . therefore",
    ", the agent with maximum information production has to set @xmath235 , and all others do not produce information and form a link in the network since @xmath215",
    ". finally , since @xmath371 is an equilibrium , agents act optimally ( their actions are best responses to the actions of others ) , thus each agent from the set of @xmath326 non - producers forms exactly one link in the network .",
    "from theorem 6 , we know that when @xmath212 , then we have a unique equilibrium @xmath195 for both @xmath241 and @xmath242 in which @xmath382 and @xmath235 . thus , we have @xmath383 and @xmath384 , which applies when the number of agents in the cin grows to infinity , hence ( [ thermeq1 ] ) follows .",
    "next , we focus on the total amount of information in the network . for @xmath242 , we have @xmath385 , and ( [ thermeq3 ] ) follows . finally , for @xmath241 , we have @xmath386 , and ( [ thermeq5 ] ) follows .",
    "we start by deriving ( [ thermeq12 ] ) . from theorem 7 , we know that for @xmath241 , every equilibrium has only one information producer .",
    "when the number of agents grows to infinity , we will still have one information producer and @xmath387 . in order to prove ( [ thermeq22 ] )",

    "for this network , we have @xmath389 .",
    "we want to show that this network is an ne by showing that every agents strategy is best response to all others .",
    "it is easy to see that since @xmath215 , each periphery agent has no incentive to break its link with the core since @xmath390 when @xmath8 is asymptotically large .",
    "moreover , no agent has incentive to alter its information production profile since the total information in the network is @xmath391 .",
    "thus , @xmath371 is an ne . since this applies to any @xmath8 , ( [ thermeq22 ] ) follows .",
