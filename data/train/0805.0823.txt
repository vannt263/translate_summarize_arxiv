    "the stellar system @xmath0 centauri is unusual in many respects .",
    "when considered as part of the galaxy s globular cluster population it is among the most luminous and the most massive , with estimates for the cluster mass ranging from 2 to 5 @xmath3 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unlike other globular clusters though , @xmath0  cen exhibits the characteristics of system that has undergone substantial chemical self - enrichment , with its member stars showing a wide spread in abundance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and complex distributions of element - to - iron abundance ratios ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) .",
    "the abundance picture is further complicated by the discovery that the lower main sequence of the cluster is bimodal @xcite , with the bluer sequence having a higher abundance @xcite .",
    "these observations can be explained if the metal - rich but bluer sequence has a substantially higher helium abundance ( y @xmath9 0.40 , see : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but generating such large helium abundances within the context of chemical evolution models is difficult ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an extensive spectroscopic survey of @xmath0  cen post - main - sequence members that characterizes the many and diverse properties of this cluster is presented in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0  cen are also unusual .",
    "unlike most globular clusters , it has a notably flattened shape and rotates comparatively rapidly ( see * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the stellar abundances and stellar kinematics are correlated , with the more metal - rich stars being not only more centrally concentrated but also kinematically cooler ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although see also @xcite . possible substructures with the cluster may also exist .",
    "for example , @xcite find evidence in their kinematic analysis for a separate disk - like component between 1 and 3 arcmin from the cluster center .",
    "finally , the orbit of @xmath0  cen is also unusual in that it is tightly bound and _ retrograde _ with apo- and peri - galactocentric distances of 6.2 and 1.2 kpc , respectively , and a period of 120 myr @xcite .",
    "the cluster never rises very far above the galactic plane : @xcite give @xmath10 as @xmath11 kpc .",
    "these characteristics have led to increasing support for the idea ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that @xmath0  cen has not evolved in isolation , but in fact represents the nuclear remnant of a now disrupted nucleated dwarf galaxy that has been accreted by the milky way .",
    "models of the orbital decay and disruption of a nucleated dwarf , which is presumed to lie initially far from the galaxy s centre , have shown that this process is dynamically plausible , with most of the dwarf s mass lost as the nucleus settles into an orbit like that of the present - day @xmath0  cen @xcite .",
    "these dynamical models , however , do not cover a full hubble time and while the likely present - day outcome is that the surviving nucleus is an isolated bound remnant , one may seek to confirm this prediction observationally .",
    "for example , in the model of @xcite , the mass of the stellar envelope surrounding the nucleus , which comes from the disrupting dwarf , is still fully @xmath150% of the mass of the nucleus at the end of the calculations 2.6 gyr after the initiation of the interaction . at this point",
    "the nucleus has achieved an orbit comparable to that of @xmath0  cen . the most likely signature of any remnant from such an interaction would be in the form of structure beyond the tidal radius of the cluster ( nucleus ) , probably in the form of tidal tails .    extra - tidal structure , particularly in the form of tidal tails , is well established around a number of globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) , with the most striking example being pal  5 @xcite .",
    "the origin of these features though lies with the interaction between the cluster and the tidal field of the galaxy rather than as a remnant from any merger process .",
    "tidal tails have been claimed to exist in @xmath0  cen by @xcite who analyzed the spatial distribution of color - magnitude diagram selected stellar samples , chosen to maximize the contrast between field and cluster stars in their photographic data . for @xmath0",
    "cen they found `` two large and significant tidal tails '' extending up to @xmath12 degrees to the north and south of the cluster and estimated that the features contained up to 1% of the cluster mass .",
    "they noted , however , that dust absorption , which they did not account for , might affect the star counts .",
    "subsequent work by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , showed that these features are much less prominent when reddening variations are properly accounted for .",
    "in this paper we present the results of an extensive spectroscopic survey in which we use radial velocity and line strength information to investigate the number and distribution of @xmath0  cen stars both within and beyond the cluster tidal radius , and to place constraints on the outer structure of the cluster and on any extra - tidal population present .",
    "the following section describes the selection of the sample , the observations and the derivation of the radial velocities .",
    "section 3 provides the analysis for stars both in the cluster and outside the cluster tidal radius .",
    "the main results are discussed in  4 and the conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "in a forthcoming paper , @xcite will present the results of an imaging survey of a region @xmath12.4 @xmath3 3.9 deg@xmath4 in size centered on @xmath0  cen .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13-band photometry was obtained with the 8k @xmath3 8k ccd mosaic camera mounted on the anu 1 m telescope at siding spring observatory . the observation , reduction and analysis techniques employed are essentially the same as those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ cmd ] shows a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) from the survey for stars that lie in the radial range 10@xmath5 @xmath14 r @xmath14 25@xmath5 from the cluster center .",
    "the principal cluster sequences such as the horizontal and giant branches , and the main sequence turnoff , are readily visible although equally , considerable field contamination is visible , a consequence of @xmath0  cen s relatively low galactic latitude ( b @xmath9 + 15@xmath15 ) .",
    "it is fortunate , however , that the radial velocity of the cluster is relatively large ( + 232 km s@xmath2 ) permitting a generally clean separation of members from non - members via the measurement of radial velocities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a substantial radial velocity survey is required , nevertheless , in order to generate a sample of likely members in the outer parts of the cluster and beyond .",
    "the two - degree field ( 2df ) multi - fibre instrument on the anglo - australian telescope @xcite provides an efficient way to conduct such a survey .",
    "the 2df is a double - buffered system allowing the fibres for the next field to be configured while observing the current field .",
    "the reconfiguration time is of order 45 - 60 minutes .",
    "consequently , the most efficient survey rate is achieved by selecting a magnitude interval that allows spectra with appropriate signal - to - noise for velocity and line - strength measurements to be obtained in total exposure times comparable to the reconfiguration time , for a given 2df instrumental setup .",
    "the instrumental setup chosen used the 1200b gratings centered at @xmath164250 giving a wavelength coverage of approximately @xmath173700 - 4800 at a scale of 1.1  / pix .",
    "the resulting spectra have a resolution of @xmath12.5 .",
    "these considerations led to the choice of the magnitude range 15.4 @xmath14 @xmath12 @xmath14 16.75 for the initial sample selection .",
    "the corresponding color limits were then set by allowing for photometric errors and by noting that the giant branch of @xmath0  cen has a significant intrinsic color width .",
    "the selection box is outlined on fig .",
    "we note that over the area of the imaging survey there are significant variations in the amount of interstellar reddening ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the limits of the selection box were altered by the appropriate amounts given the difference in mean reddening between each ccd mosaic field and the central field .",
    "the largest shift applied was 0.08 mag in @xmath18 and 0.18 in @xmath12 . the initial selected sample",
    "was then modified to exclude any candidate that lay within @xmath110@xmath19 of a bright neighbor .",
    "the imaging survey covers a rectangular region @xmath12.4@xmath15 ( ew ) by 3.9@xmath15 ( ns ) in size while the 2df field is circular .",
    "we therefore chose four 2df field centers to the n , s , e and w of the cluster center to maximize the coverage of the imaging survey area .",
    "stars closer to the cluster center than 20@xmath5 were excluded to minimize crowding concerns while still leaving enough likely members to define radial velocity and line strength distributions .",
    "six configurations were generated for both the n and s field centers and four for the e and w fields with a total of approximately 5500 candidates .",
    "for each field approximately 15 stars were kept in common between all configurations while a modest number of stars in the overlap regions between fields were retained in the configurations for both field centers , all to allow monitoring of any systematic effects .",
    "each configuration also included @xmath140 fibres allocated to blank sky regions , evenly distributed between the two 2df spectrographs .",
    "these regions were selected from the imaging survey to contain no detected stars ( i.e.  @xmath20 ) within a radius of 10@xmath19 .",
    "the observing run took place over 5 nights in 2003 may and a total of 16 configurations were observed : six in each of the n and s fields and two each in the e and w fields . the observing sequence for each configuration consisted of three 1800 sec exposures preceded and followed by arc lamp exposures and a fibre flat field exposure .",
    "multiple exposures , including exposures recorded in each of the two 2df spectrographs , were also obtained of six bright radial velocity standards .",
    "these spectra provide templates for cross - correlations with the program star spectra and for setting the velocity zero point .",
    "the observed data sets , which come in pairs as the 400 2df fibres feed two separate spectrographs each imaging 200 fibres onto a ccd detector , were reduced with the 2df reduction program _",
    "2dfdr_. the fibre flat field exposure was used to generate the ` tram line ' map , which was then rotated and shifted to track the pixel locations of the individual fibre spectra .",
    "the fibre spectra were then ` fit ' extracted with the wavelength calibration coming from the appropriate arc lamp exposures .",
    "the fibre spectra for the blank sky regions were then median - combined to form a single sky spectrum , which was then subtracted from each object spectrum using a weighting appropriate for the transmission of the object fibre .",
    "the relative fibre transmissions were determined either from twilight sky exposures with the same configuration , or from median combined offset sky exposures obtained as part of the observing sequence .",
    "the reduced spectra from the individual exposures for each configuration were then median combined to remove cosmic - ray contamination .",
    "examples of the reduced spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "the radial velocities were determined by cross - correlation techniques using the iraf routine _ fxcor_. the velocity analysis was carried out independently for each of the two 2df spectrograph data sets , including the use of template spectra observed with the appropriate spectrograph .",
    "only spectra that had at least 400 counts at the g - band ( @xmath1@xmath164300 ) were included in order to minimize the velocity errors .",
    "the primary template spectra employed were those of the @xmath12=6.20 f8 iv - v star hd162396 which provided the best spectral match to the program stars .",
    "the correlation was carried out over the wavelength range @xmath1738004700 , a spectral region that encompasses a number of strong features such as the caii h and k lines , the g - band of ch and the h@xmath21 and h@xmath22 hydrogen lines ( cf .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "heliocentric corrections were then applied to correct for the earth s motion resulting in velocities for 4105 program objects relative to the velocities for the two template spectra ( i.e.  the velocity zero points for the two data sets ) which remain to be determined . these were determined through the observations of standard stars of known velocity : the zero points are set so that the mean difference between the observed and catalogue velocities for the standards is zero .",
    "six observations of four standards in addition to that of the primary template were employed for the spectrograph 1 data set while five observations of the same four standards plus that of the primary template were used for the spectrograph 2 data .",
    "the uncertainty in the zero points is then the standard error of these mean differences .",
    "the values are @xmath62 km s@xmath2 for the spectrograph 1 data and @xmath63 km s@xmath2 for the spectrograph 2 data .",
    "the overall process was verified by making use of the eight programs stars that had at least two velocity determinations in both the spectrograph 1 and the spectrograph 2 data . the mean velocity difference ( spectrograph 1  spectrograph 2 ) for these stars is 2 km s@xmath2 with a standard error of the mean of 4 km s@xmath2 , indicating excellent consistency between the two data sets .",
    "the errors in the individual program star velocities were then determined from the 19 program stars that had at least five observations during the observing run , including observations across both data sets .",
    "the mean standard deviation from these sets of multiple observations , which we take as the error associated with a single program star velocity determination , is 11 km s@xmath2 ; the uncertainty in this value is @xmath61 km s@xmath2 .",
    "[ vel_pos ] shows the spatial location of the 4105 program stars with measured velocities .",
    "figure [ vel_histo1 ] shows velocity histograms for all stars inside the adopted cluster tidal radius of 57@xmath5 .",
    "this value has been taken from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "given the importance of this parameter , a brief discussion is appropriate .",
    "@xcite list a core radius of 2.6@xmath5 for the cluster and a concentration index _ c_=1.24 , which implies a tidal radius of 45@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite derived similar values ( 2.6@xmath5 , 1.22 , 44@xmath5 ) from @xcite model fits , but noted that the observed data indicated a larger value for the tidal radius .",
    "the best - fit dynamical models of @xcite and @xcite , which are a sizeable improvement over the simple @xcite models , have tidal radii between 46@xmath5 and 60@xmath5 , with the larger values showing a better fit to the outermost observed surface density data points .",
    "the data presented in  3.3 also imply a tidal radius consistent with the @xcite value . fortunately ,",
    "none of the results of this paper depend significantly on the actual value of the cluster tidal radius , provided it is similar that adopted to within a few arcmin .",
    "the histogram in fig .",
    "[ vel_histo1 ] outlined by the solid line shows the velocity distribution for the stars with radial distances from the cluster center between 20@xmath5 and 30@xmath5 .",
    "it is clearly bimodal with one population , predominantly foreground disk stars , centered near zero velocity and a second population , predominantly cluster members , centered near the cluster velocity of 232 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mean velocity for the 119 stars within the velocity interval 190270 km s@xmath2 ( chosen to encompass all likely members given the distribution in fig .  [ vel_histo1 ] ) is 229 km s@xmath2 with a dispersion of 14 km s@xmath2 . the mean velocity agrees well with the known cluster velocity given the uncertainty in the velocity system zero point discussed above .",
    "moreover , the observed dispersion value is consistent with that expected from the combination of the intrinsic dispersion of the cluster at these radii , @xmath18 km s@xmath2 , ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) and the individual velocity errors .",
    "these stars will be referred to as the _ inner _ cluster sample .",
    "the histogram outlined by the dot - dash line in fig .",
    "[ vel_histo1 ] is for stars with radial distances between 30@xmath5 and 57@xmath5 . because of the larger area and the decreasing density of cluster stars with increasing radial distance , the contaminating population now considerably outweighs the cluster population , which nevertheless remains detectable above the high velocity tail of the field star distribution . using the same selection interval as for the inner region ,",
    "the 46 candidate cluster members have a mean velocity of 227 km s@xmath2 and a velocity dispersion of 17 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the increased velocity dispersion over that seen for the inner region presumably suggests that this outer sample is contaminated to some extent with non - cluster members .",
    "these stars will be referred to as the _ outer _ cluster sample .",
    "two other criteria can be used to investigate the question of cluster membership .",
    "first , noting that the expected proper motion of cluster members is small ( cf .",
    "* ) , we can use published proper motion catalogs to weed out from the sample any stars with significant motions , as they are unlikely to be cluster members ( though equally a small proper motion does not guarantee cluster membership ) .",
    "second , while it is well established that @xmath0  cen has a substantial internal abundance range , we can still use the spectra to define relations between various line strength parameters and again seek outliers from the relations defined by the majority of stars .",
    "considering first proper motions , since the majority of the candidates are too faint to be included in the ucac2 catalog @xcite , we extracted from the supercosmos science archive proper motions for all the stars in the outer cluster sample ( due to crowding effects we did not consider the proper motions for the inner cluster sample ) .",
    "@xcite indicate that for the magnitude range of our program stars , the estimated proper motion accuracy is of order 10 mas / yr . the mean motions in ra and dec for the 46 stars were calculated along with the standard deviations , which were 6.3 mas / yr in ra and 5.5 mas / yr in dec , respectively .",
    "one star , 6_6_1259 ( cf .",
    "table [ nonmembers ] ) lay outside the error ellipse defined by 3@xmath23 and 3@xmath24 .",
    "it was not considered in the analysis of spectral line strengths .    for line strength parameters we first removed the overall continuum shape of the spectra by fitting a lower order polynomial using the iraf routine _",
    "continuum_. following , for example , @xcite , we then measured via numerical integration the equivalent widths of the caii k line and the g - band of ch and , via gaussian fits , the equivalent widths of the h@xmath21 and h@xmath22 hydrogen lines ( cf .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "the continuum and feature band passes used are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the k - line and g - band strengths serve as metal abundance indicators while the hydrogen line strengths serve as an indicator of effective temperature .",
    "the mean uncertainties in the line strengths were then determined from the standard deviations of the measurements for the seven stars in the inner sample that have at least 6 observations . for stars with multiple spectra",
    "the individual line strength measurements were averaged . only for one star was it not possible to measure all 4 indices : for star 8_6_15256 the h@xmath21 line was significantly affected by noise and no reliable measurement could be made .",
    "the other line strengths , however , are consistent with cluster membership .    given that the inner sample is likely to consist largely of cluster members , we used this sample to define relations between the k - line strength and the average hydrogen line strength @xmath25/2 $ ] , and between the g - band strength and @xmath26 for probable cluster stars .",
    "these relations are shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ ew_fig ] . turning first to the upper left panel",
    ", we can see that , as expected given the well established abundance range in @xmath0  cen , there is a significant range in the k - line strengths for the inner sample stars that is anti - correlated with hydrogen line strength .",
    "the solid line in the panel represents a least squares fit to the data , while the dotted lines represent @xmath62@xmath3 the rms about the fit after excluding the four stars plotted as open circles .",
    "two of these are clearly deviant , but exclusion of the two stars with the weakest k - lines deserves some comment . the abundance distribution in @xmath0  cen is well established ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and is characterized by a steep initial rise to the mean abundance followed by a long tail to higher abundances . excluding the two stars with the lowest k - line strengths , the distribution of k - line strengths in the panel reflects this general shape and for that reason the two stars have been excluded .",
    "a small number of stars also lie to the right of the + 2@xmath27 line in the panel .",
    "these are nevertheless considered members because they all show very strong g - bands and other features indicating probable carbon over - abundances ( see fig .",
    "[ cstarsfig ] ) .",
    "the exclusion of 4 stars from the inner sample as possible non - members is consistent with the number of field stars expected in the adopted cluster velocity range , given the number of stars in the velocity intervals adjacent to that for the cluster seen in the solid histogram in fig .",
    "[ vel_histo1 ] .",
    "the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ ew_fig ] shows the distribution of g - band strengths for the inner sample .",
    "once again the solid line is a least squares fit and the dotted lines are @xmath62@xmath3 the rms about the fit after again excluding the four stars plotted as open circles .",
    "there is clearly a very large range in g - band strengths for the stars in this sample .",
    "many of the stars with strong g - bands also show additional ch absorption in the region around @xmath164370 ; some examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ cstarsfig ] .",
    "the existence of stars in @xmath0  cen with a range of overabundances of carbon is well established ; see , for example , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the lower left panel shows the w@xmath28,w@xmath29 for the stars in the outer sample .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are reproduced from the equivalent panel for the inner sample .",
    "given that there is evidence for a radial abundance gradient in the cluster , in the sense that metal - rich objects are less frequent in the outer regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it seems unlikely that the outer sample would contain comparatively more metal - rich objects than the inner sample .",
    "consequently , for the stars with strong k - lines , we have considered stars with w@xmath28 @xmath30 10.6  to be non - members even if they are within the @xmath62@xmath27 boundaries . in many cases these stars have g - band strengths that fall outside in the @xmath62@xmath27 boundary in the lower right panel , confirming their probable non - member status .",
    "all - in - all we classify 6 of the outer sample stars as non - members .",
    "as noted above there is seventh probable non - member in the outer sample based on a discrepant proper motion .",
    "interestingly , like the inner region , the outer region also contains a number of ch - strong stars .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ cstarsfig ] .",
    "inspection of the dashed line histogram in fig .",
    "[ vel_histo1 ] suggests that excluding 7 stars from the outer sample as likely non - members is perhaps a conservative number ; there may well be an additional number of approximately the same size of non - member stars in this sample that we have not been able to conclusively identify .",
    "such identification would require velocities with a higher degree of precision than that presented here as well as knowledge of the cluster velocity dispersion in this outer region .",
    "one star deserves special mention .",
    "this is star 10_2_28 whose spectrum is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "* ) but the known members stars with similar spectra , such as roa 577 ( see fig .  25 of * ? ?",
    "* ) , are found on the red giant branch at considerably brighter magnitudes .",
    "determining the radial velocity of 10_2_28 is not straightforward given the very different spectral type .",
    "nevertheless , cross - correlations with the latest spectral - type among the observed radial velocity standards and with probable @xmath0  cen members such as 8_8_4146 ( cf .",

    "clearly more accurate velocities and abundance information are required to more firmly establish the association or otherwise of these stars with @xmath0  cen , but for the present we will assume that they are all extra - tidal members of the cluster and treat derived quantities as upper limits . the alternative assumption , that all or some of these stars are simply members of the field halo population , can not be ruled out .    the immediate question to ask is what fraction of the mass of @xmath0  cen is potentially represented by the extra - tidal stars . assuming that the extra - tidal population is identical with that of the cluster , we can estimate the fraction as follows . using a core radius of 2.4@xmath5 and a tidal radius of 57@xmath5 and the integral formulae given in @xcite , the percentage of the total luminosity of the cluster contained between 20@xmath5 and the tidal radius is approximately 10 per cent .",
    "assuming mass follows light , this figure also represents the fraction of the total mass contained in this radial region .",
    "the region is also characterized by the 154 likely members we have identified , whereas using the surface density calculated above , the region between one and two tidal radii is estimated to contain , _ at most _ , approximately 10 extra - tidal members with the same characteristics .",
    "consequently , combining these numbers , we conclude that an",
    "_ upper limit _ on the amount of mass in extra - tidal material lying between one and two tidal radii from the cluster centre is of order 0.7 @xmath6 0.2 per cent of the total cluster mass",
    ". it may well be considerably less .",
    "the uncertainty quoted comes solely from assuming poisson statistics apply to the sample of 6 identified extra - tidal member candidates .",
    "this limit is comparable to the results of @xcite who estimated a @xmath11% upper limit on the extra - tidal populations of three globular clusters ( ngc  288 , m30 and m55 ) but differs from that of @xcite who estimate that at least 3% of the present cluster mass is associated with the tidal tails of the globular cluster ngc  5466 .",
    "the biggest contrast is of course with pal 5 , where the mass in the extensive tidal tails exceeds the mass of the cluster itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in fig .",
    "[ sb_prof ] we show the ( circularly averaged ) surface density profile of @xmath0  cen from the center to the outermost regions , covering a factor of @xmath110@xmath38 in surface density .",
    "the profile combines the surface photometry and star - count data from @xcite , together with the circularly averaged surface density data from @xcite and that derived from our cluster member sample .",
    "the points from @xcite are for stars from just below the turnoff and brighter ( cf .",
    "[ cmd ] ) and are for regions where image crowding is not a concern .",
    "the background density was determined from the extensive region beyond the tidal radius covered in the imaging survey .",
    "the stars included correspond to those that dominate the integrated light and thus no systematic effects are expected in scaling the surface density count data to the surface brightness observations ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any case",
    "the long 2-body relaxation time of @xmath0  cen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially in the outer parts , means that significant mass segregation in this cluster is unlikely .",
    "indeed @xcite find no dynamical evidence for any change in _",
    "m / l _ with radius , as expected given the relatively long relaxation time .",
    "the surface density points from the cluster member sample were determined as follows .",
    "first , we grouped the radial distribution of the 154 probable @xmath0  cen members into annuli .",
    "mean surface densities were then calculated with errors determined from the number of stars in each annulus . while fig .",
    "[ vel_pos ] shows that each annulus has not been completely surveyed , we assume that there is no radial variation in the degree of incompleteness .",
    "the resulting surface densities were then matched with the existing data in the region between 20@xmath5 and 26@xmath5 . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ sb_prof ] the agreement between the new and existing data at these , and larger radii , is excellent .",
    "this serves as confirmation that our sample , while not complete , is suitably representative .",
    "overall the profile shows a rapidly declining surface density distribution with a limiting radius consistent with the value we have adopted for the cluster tidal radius , shown by the vertical line in the figure .",
    "[ sb_prof ] also shows the density inferred for the extra - tidal population in the region between one and two tidal radii , _ if _ the six candidates identified here are all associated with the cluster .",
    "given the extensive range in surface density , the complete profile shown in fig .",
    "[ sb_prof ] , not surprisingly , can not be adequately represented by analytic formulae such as those of @xcite , or by simple models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , more complex models , for example those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , do appear capable of fitting the entire profile .",
    "we note in passing that the models of @xcite adopt a tidal radius of 45@xmath5 , which on the basis of fig .",
    "[ sb_prof ] , is somewhat too small . the core radius of the cluster is well established at r@xmath39 ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "table [ sb_tab ] lists the surface density data from @xcite , and from this work , in a manner that is directly compatible with table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the photometric work of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) concluded that @xmath0  cen lacks any notable extra - tidal structure , with the extensive tidal tails originally proposed by @xcite arising from the lack of allowance for the effects of reddening variations across the field ( a possibility that @xcite themselves acknowledged ) .",
    "our spectroscopy based results are consistent with , and strengthen , this result .",
    "as noted in  1 , the presence of extra - tidal structure , particularly in the form of tidal tails , is relatively well established in a number of globular clusters with the most striking example being pal  5 @xcite . clearly , however",
    ", @xmath0  cen does not obviously fall into this category .",
    "the most likely explanation for this is as follows . the largest dynamical influence on @xmath0  cen is the ` tidal shocking ' that occurs each time the cluster passes through the galactic plane ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , as is also the case for pal  5 ( cf .",
    "@xcite present a detailed model of the structure of @xmath0  cen , constrained by high quality proper motions and radial velocities for many thousands of cluster member stars , and we can use this model to estimate the effects of tidal shocks on the outer parts of the cluster . with the parameters given in  9.5 of @xcite , which rely on the @xmath0  cen orbital parameters listed by @xcite ,",
    "the average change in the velocity of an @xmath0  cen star as a result of the impulse that occurs as the cluster traverses the galactic plane is estimated as @xmath40@xmath41_v_@xmath40 @xmath42 0.17 r@xmath5 km s@xmath2 , where r@xmath5 is the radial distance of the star from the cluster center in arcmin .",
    "this is to be compared with the local escape velocity , which can be approximated by twice the local velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the form of the velocity dispersion in the outer parts of @xmath0  cen is not well established ( even the observations of @xcite reach only a maximum of @xmath130@xmath5 from the center ) but it is clear that it is only in the outermost parts of the cluster that the tidal shock effects are large enough to add sufficient energy to ( some ) cluster stars to cause them to escape . indeed as @xcite note , the phase - space structure of the outer parts of @xmath0  cen may well be completely dominated by the effects of the relatively frequent tidal shocks : @xcite estimate that the cluster is immersed in the disk and feels the additional gravitational field for @xmath110% of the @xmath1120 myr orbital period .",
    "the main point here though is that the region of @xmath0  cen which is most strongly influenced by the tidal shocks contains only a very small fraction of the total mass of the cluster , unlike the situation for pal  5 @xcite .",
    "for example , only @xmath11% of the @xmath0  cen mass lies between @xmath140@xmath5 and the tidal radius .",
    "consequently , it is likely that tidal shocks are indeed driving the escape of stars consistent with the limits on the extra - tidal population observed here .",
    "further , we note that if stars leave the cluster with a relative velocity of @xmath11 km s@xmath2 , then that is sufficient for the star to traverse the region between 1 and 2 tidal radii in less than the orbital period of the cluster around the galaxy . thus even if tidal shocks are driving the escape of a small number of stars",
    ", the number remaining close to the cluster will be small , again consistent with the observed lack of extra - tidal stars in our study .",
    "indeed this suggests that if it were possible to isolate putative @xmath0  cen main sequence stars at and beyond the tidal radius against the enormous field contamination , it may well be possible to characterize tidal tails from @xmath0  cen",
    ". such discrimination might be possible with gaia data though many square degrees of sky would need to be searched .",
    "in the context of the model in which @xmath0  cen is the remnant nucleus of a disrupted former dwarf galaxy , it is clear from the above that any stars which are more loosely bound than those in the outer parts of the remnant nucleus / star cluster will be even more strongly affected by the tidal shocks .",
    "consequently , they would have been lost from the vicinity of the remnant nucleus / star cluster at relatively early stages in the interaction , once the disrupting dwarf galaxy has approached the current orbit of @xmath0  cen .",
    "the dynamical models of @xcite and @xcite show that this occurs within about 3 gyr of the initiation of the interaction .",
    "given that any gas in the original dwarf would have been used up in star formation ( cf .",
    "* ) ( and any remaining stripped out ) in the first phases of the interaction , and that @xmath0  cen contains only stars with ages in excess of @xmath110 gyr , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is evident that the more loosely bound stars have been lost from the vicinity of @xmath0  cen many gyr ago , and are now widely dispersed around the galaxy .",
    "the kinematic signatures of local field stars that may have had their origin with the disrupted system that once contained @xmath0  cen have been modeled , and such stars may well have been observationally detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this sense",
    "the currently disrupting dwarf galaxy sagittarius and its central massive star cluster m54 provide a similar example to the postulated scenario for @xmath0  cen , but on a longer timescale  eventually the sgr field stars will disperse uniformly around the galaxy but like @xmath0  cen , m54 will retain its dynamical integrity for a very long time .",
    "we have carried out an extensive radial velocity and line - strength analysis of observations of a large sample of stars that covers the outer parts of the globular cluster @xmath0  cen and a substantial area beyond the cluster s tidal radius . while the analysis has led to the establishment of cluster membership for @xmath1150 stars in the outer parts of the cluster , and revealed that the steeply declining radial surface density distribution of these stars is consistent with other extant data , the survey has identified only a very small number of objects that can be plausibly classified as extra - tidal cluster stars .",
    "the upper limit on the amount of mass potentially contained in the region between 1 and 2 tidal radii is less than one percent of the present cluster mass .",
    "we conclude therefore that there is no compelling evidence for any significant extra - tidal population associated with @xmath0  cen .",
