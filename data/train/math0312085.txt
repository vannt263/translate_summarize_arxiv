    "we have seen that only six `` types '' can occur ( see theorem  [ thm1 ] below ) .",
    "we showed the existences for a few cases by giving explicit examples , such as coadjoint orbits or toric varieties . in this paper , we illustrate a method for constructing such manifolds .",
    "as a consequence , this proves the existences of the manifolds with those prescribed types as in @xcite .",

    "we mainly use symplectic topological method and related results on symplectic 4-manifolds .",
    "recall that the moment map @xmath3 is a perfect morse - bott function .",
    "the fixed point sets of the circle action are exactly the critical sets of @xmath3 .",
    "each critical set has even index .",
    "@xmath3 has a unique local minimum and a unique local maximum ( @xcite ) .",
    "recall the following definitions from @xcite :    let @xmath0 be a connected , compact 6-dimensional symplectic manifold equipped with a semi - free hamiltonian @xmath1 action such that the fixed point set consists of isolated points or surfaces .",
    "assume dim @xmath2 .",
    "for each such manifold , we define the @xmath4 to be the diffeomorphism type of the fixed point sets , their indices , and @xmath5 , where @xmath5 denotes the 1st chern number of the normal bundle of the minimum when the minimum is a surface .",
    "if the minimum ( or the maximum ) is a surface , then for a regular value right above the minimum ( or right below the maximum ) , the reduced space is diffeomorphic to the total space of an @xmath6 fibration over the minimum ( or over the maximum ) .",
    "when the fixed point set consists only of surfaces , the reduced spaces at the non - extremal values are all diffeomorphic , and there is a canonical isomorphism between their ( co)homology groups ( see @xcite ) .    let @xmath7 be a compact connected 6-dimensional symplectic manifold equipped with a semi - free hamiltonian circle action . assume the fixed point set consists only of surfaces .",
    "if the fibers of the reduced spaces at a regular level right above the minimum and right below the maximum can be represented by the same cohomology class of the reduced space , we say there is @xmath8 ; otherwise , we say there is a @xmath9 .    in @xcite , we have shown the following    [ thm1 ] let @xmath7 be a connected compact 6 dimensional symplectic manifold equipped with a semi - free hamiltonian circle action such that the fixed point set consists of isolated points or surfaces .",

    "[ rem1 ] the picture gives us an order of how the moment map crosses the fixed point sets .",
    "for instance , manifold of type ( 1 ) means that the manifold has an isolated minimum , an index 2 sphere , and an isolated maximum .    for manifold of type ( 2 ) , the two index 2 spheres can not be on the same level of the moment map .    for manifolds of type ( 3 ) and ( 5 )",
    ", the moment map can cross the two non - extremal fixed point sets in any order or the 2 fixed point sets are on the same level of the moment map .",
    "[ rem1 ] in @xcite , we have seen that when there is an index 2 surface or the maximum is a surface in a certain `` type '' , the 1st chern numbers of the normal bundles of these surfaces are uniquely determined by the fixed point data and the twist type .",
    "( this is the reason that @xmath13 is not included in the definition of the @xmath4 . ) for instance , for manifolds of type ( 1 ) , the 1st chern numbers of the positive normal bundle and the negative normal bundle of the index 2 sphere are both @xmath14 ; for manifolds of type ( 2 ) , the 1st chern numbers of the positive normal bundle and the negative normal bundle of the 1st ( counting from bottom ) index 2 sphere are @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , and those of the second index 2 sphere are respectively @xmath16 and @xmath15 . notice that in type ( 4 ) and type ( 5 ) , @xmath5 and @xmath13 have fixed values , in types ( 3 ) , ( 6a ) and ( 6b ) , on the other hand , @xmath5 can vary , and in particular , for type ( 6a ) , the genuses @xmath11 and @xmath12 can vary .",
    "different values of these `` variables '' of course give different manifolds .",
    "[ rem2 ] we have shown in @xcite that there exists a manifold of type ( 1 ) which is a coadjoint orbit of @xmath17 .",
    "we constructed toric varieties for type ( 3 ) when @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for type ( 4 ) and for type ( 6b ) with @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , we have shown that all manifolds of type ( 4 ) are diffeomorphic to @xmath21 , and all manifolds of type ( 6b ) with @xmath20 are diffeomorphic to the corresponding toric variety which is @xmath21 blow up at a point .    in @xcite and in this paper",
    ", the @xmath4 has a certain meaning , for the sake of convenience .",
    "more generally , similar data ( looser or stronger ) is an important tool for the studying of symplectic lie group actions , especially for the studying of hamiltonian lie group actions .",
    "it captures important geometrical and topological information about the manifolds .",
    "as we have seen in @xcite , for a fixed `` type '' in theorem  [ thm1 ] , the @xmath4 uniquely determines the equivariant ( ordinary ) cohomology ring and equivariant ( ordinary ) chern classes of the manifold .",
    "more significantly , for some cases , this data classifies the manifolds up to diffeomorphism ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recall that for all the types of manifolds in theorem  [ thm1 ] , the reduced spaces ( except at the extremal values ) are @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "we understand well the symplectic structures of these 4-manifolds and their symplectic submanifolds . in this paper",
    ", we use this special feature to construct manifolds with the types prescribed in theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "we will show that for each `` type '' in theorem  [ thm1 ] , except for type ( 6a ) with @xmath24 , this `` local '' data ( related in a global way , however ) allows us to construct a `` global '' manifold with the prescribed data .",
    "in fact , except for type ( 6a ) with @xmath24 , this data uniquely determines the inverse image ( under the moment map ) of a small neighborhood of each critical or regular value of the moment map up to equivariant symplectomorphism ( see section 2 ) .",
    "let us call these `` local pieces '' .",
    "a `` local piece '' for the minimum or the maximum can always be constructed .",
    "the main problem is to construct a `` local piece '' for an index 2 surface . in this case",
    ", we need 4 pieces of information @xmath25 ( see section 2 for its meaning ) , where @xmath26 is the reduced space at this critical level , and @xmath27 has to be a symplectic submanifold of @xmath26 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath27 is the symplectically embedded image of the index 2 surface in @xmath26 ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the prescribed type must make this to be true .",
    "of course , the prescribed type must guarantee that each reduced space is symplectic , i.e. , the cohomology classes of the reduced symplectic forms ( we can only know the cohomology classes of the forms ) do contain symplectic forms ( see section 3 ) .",
    "for ( 6a ) , if @xmath24 , the dual class ( which can be computed from the `` type '' ) of the surface in the reduced space can not represent the symplectically embedded image of the index 2 surface . that is the reason we failed to construct such manifolds for type ( 6a )",
    "when @xmath24 .",
    "in order to construct the manifolds globally , we need to perform some gluing along some regular levels .",
    "the main reason we can perform the gluing is that for a regular level of the moment map , two different symplectic forms in the same cohomology class of the reduced space ( which is @xmath22 or a @xmath28 ) are diffeomorphic .",
    "these classification results on the symplectic structures on @xmath22 or @xmath23 are due to taubes and lalonde - mcduff ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in @xcite and in this paper , we assumed that @xmath10 @xmath2 . under this assumption",
    ", we defined @xmath4 .",
    "notice that the definition of @xmath9 does not depend on this restriction , it is defined when the fixed point set consists only of surfaces . as we mentioned in remark",
    "[ rem1 ] , when there is an index 2 surface or the maximum is a surface in a certain `` type '' , the 1st chern numbers of the normal bundles of these surfaces are uniquely determined by the fixed point data .",
    "the `` twist type '' controls the `` top '' and the `` bottom '' .",
    "if we remove the assumption @xmath10 @xmath2 , we have more fixed point set components .",
    "if the fixed point set consists only of surfaces , we still have our definition of @xmath9 .",
    "if the fixed point set also consists index 2 or index 4 isolated points , then the reduced spaces change not only by diffeomorphism , but also by blow up or blow downs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reduced spaces and their cohomologies are more complicated .",
    "the definition of @xmath9 needs to be properly addressed . for the definition of @xmath4",
    ", we need to specify more 1st chern numbers of the normal bundles of the fixed point set components to determine those of the other fixed point set components . alternatively , depending on the purposes , we may assume that all these chern numbers for all the fixed point set components are compatibly given and we include all of them in the definition .",
    "for the construction of these more complicated manifolds , we may not understand the symplectic structures on the reduced spaces well enough to do the local construction or to perform the global gluing .",
    "certainly , in good cases , if our requrements are satisfied , we can still construct the manifolds with certain `` types '' other than those in theorem  [ thm1 ] .    in summary , in order to construct a global manifold from a prescribed type ,",
    "we need the `` data '' to be `` compatibly matched '' , and we need the reduced spaces to be `` good enough '' to allow us to perform the gluing .",
    "the idea itself can be applied to more general constructions of hamiltonian @xmath1 manifolds , for instance , for non - semi - free hamiltonian circle actions on other dimensional symplectic manifolds with other fixed point set components . or more generally , depending on what is given , the idea itself may be applied to the setting with no hamiltonian circle actions .",
    "the main result of this paper is    [ thm2 ] there exists a manifold for any of the prescribed fixed point data and twist type as in theorem  [ thm1 ] , except that for type ( 6a ) , the genuses @xmath11 and @xmath12 must satisfy @xmath29 .    recall that for type ( 6a ) , we computed the dual class @xmath30 of the index 2 surface in the reduced space at the critical level in @xcite : @xmath31 for even @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for odd @xmath32 ( see section 3 for the meaning of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "if @xmath24 , then these dual classes can not represent the connected symplectically embedded index 2 surface in the reduced spaces .",
    "the class @xmath36 ( for even @xmath32 ) or @xmath37 ( for odd @xmath32 ) represents non - connected symplectic submanifolds .",
    "the classes @xmath31 or @xmath33 with @xmath38 can not represent the symplectically embedded image of the genus @xmath12 index 2 surface due to the following reason : the projection of the embedded surface ( represented by @xmath31 or @xmath33 ) to the `` base '' of the @xmath6 fibration ( represented by @xmath35 ) is a smooth degree 2 map from a genus @xmath12 riemann surface to a genus @xmath11 riemann surface . by the analogue hurwitz formula for smooth maps between riemann surfaces ( see theorem 1 in @xcite ) , @xmath12 and @xmath11 must satisfy @xmath39 .",
    "this is the reason we can not construct such manifolds .",
    "this fact also helps us to strengthen theorem  [ thm1 ] :    for type ( 6a ) in theorem  [ thm1 ] , the genuses of the surfaces must satisfy @xmath29 .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] and this corollary give us a complete list of the possible `` types '' .",
    "theorem  [ thm2 ] shows that there exist manifolds of all these `` types '' .",
    "together , they give us exactly the `` types '' of manifolds that can occur under the assumptions of theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
