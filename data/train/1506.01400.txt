    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are the oldest and most massive stellar aggregates in our galaxy . as such",
    ", they are the best natural laboratories to study large , co - eval populations of stars at known distance and metallicity .",
    "indeed , much of our understanding of star formation and evolution has been derived from observational studies of gcs .",
    "nonetheless , we still lack an understanding of the very low mass stars ( vlmss ) around the faint end of the hydrogen - burning main sequence ( ms ) and of objects beyond that limit , i.e. , sub - stellar sources , so called `` brown dwarfs '' ( bds ) .",
    "this is especially true for objects at the low - metallicities typical for the gcs in our milky way ( see below ) .",
    "bds present a link between stars and planets , and thus are important for our understanding of both star and planet formation and evolution .",
    "bds are sub - stellar objects that are not massive enough to ignite and sustain hydrogen burning .",
    "thus , where low - mass stars will retain their luminosity for a hubble time or longer , a bd will continue to cool and become fainter with age . like giant gas planets ,",
    "bds have complex atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the distinction between stars , bds and planets is either based on mass or on formation . in general , stars have masses @xmath4 and can sustain hydrogen burning , bds have masses between 80 and 13 @xmath5 and can not sustain hydrogen burning but a short period of deuterium burning , and giant planets have masses below 13 @xmath5 and can not sustain deuterium burning ( burrows et al .  1997 , stamatellos 2014 , but see also sect .",
    "[ hmass ] ) . because low - mass stars and bds have life - times much longer than the age of the galaxy , the gc vlmss and bds are also important tracers of galactic formation and chemical evolution .    the formation of bds is a matter of considerable dispute .",
    "they might have formed in the same way as ( low - mass ) stars from turbulent cloud fragmentation @xcite , which would imply a continuous extension of the imf into the sub - stellar regime . on the other hand",
    ", bds might form e.g. from the ejection of stellar embryos or sub - stellar clumps which did not have the chance to accumulate enough mass @xcite .",
    "kroupa & bouvier ( 2003 ) suggested that bds form via photo - evaporation of protostars through nearby massive stars .",
    "this might also suggest an increase in the number of bds with cluster mass , as more massive clusters have more o stars which can produce more bds .",
    "bds might also form from the fragmentation of circumstellar disks ( stamatellos et al .",
    "2011 , thies et al .",
    "2010 , kaplan et al .",
    "2012 ) . in this case",
    ", the number of bds in clusters could be enhanced in dense clusters as dynamical interactions between cluster stars lead to more disk fragmentation .",
    "thies et al .",
    "( 2015 ) concluded that bds likely form not just via one formation scenario , but from a combination of various channels .",
    "large surveys undertaken in the past decade have detected large numbers of bds .",
    "for example , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , the united kingdom infrared telescope deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al .  2007 ) , the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , wright et al .",
    "2010 ) all sky survey have been very successful in finding such cool , low - mass objects . however , for most of these bds , key physical properties like metallicity and age are unconstrained ( see e.g. ) .",
    "in fact , determining the physical parameters is extremely difficult and a major hurdle in bd research .",
    "observations of open star clusters and star forming regions , where all sources are at the same distance and metallicity , can mitigate this problem ( e.g. steele et al .  1995 , rebolo et al .",
    "1996 , martn et al.2001 , pinfield et al .",
    "2003 , boudreault & lodieu 2013 , casewell et al .",
    "2014 ) , but only for young and metal - rich objects .",
    "thus the need for benchmark sources is especially evident for the metal - poor regime , and indeed we still do not know much about _ old , metal - poor _ bds .",
    "so far , only very few low - metallicity , old vlmss near the h - burning limit , and even fewer sub - stellar ( candidate ) halo objects have been identified ( e.g. burgasser et al .",
    "2003 , 2009 , lpine et al .",
    "2004 , burgasser & kirkpatrick 2006 , cushing et al .",
    "2009 , sivarani et al .",
    "2009 , murray et al .",

    "2013 , pinfield et al .",
    "2014 , luhman & sheppard 2014 , burningham et al.2014 , kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "this is where gcs come in : they are massive , and thus might have produced bds in large numbers , and they are also the oldest and most metal - poor stellar aggregates in our galaxy .",
    "potentially , gcs are the ideal hunting ground for old , metal - poor benchmark vlmss and bds which are much needed if we are to test stellar and sub - stellar formation and evolution theories and models of metal - poor ( sub-)stellar atmospheres .",
    "however , identifying substellar objects in gc is challenging due to their intrinsic faintness .",
    "therefore , the closest gcs make the best targets for this kind of research . out of the gcs in our galaxy , m4 ( ngc6121 )",
    "is the closest gc to us ; distance estimates range from 1.7 kpc ( hansen et al .",
    "2004 ) to @xmath6 2 kpc ( e.g. bedin et al.2009 ) .",
    "braga et al .  (",
    "2015 ) estimated a true distance modulus of 11.28 mag based on rr lyrae period - luminosity and period - wesenheit relations , resulting in a distance of 1.8 kpc , which agrees well with previous estimates .",
    "malavolta et al .",
    "( 2014 ) analyzed 7250 spectra for 2771 cluster stars and found a metallicity of @xmath7=-1.07 $ ] dex ( rgb ) to @xmath7=-1.16 $ ] dex ( sub giant branch and ms stars ) , which is well in line with previous metallicity estimates ( e.g. @xmath7=-1.15 $ ] dex according to the 2010 update of the harris , 1996 , catalogue of globular clusters in the milky way ) .",
    "as such , m4 is a prime target for ultra - deep observational studies . indeed , deep optical studies with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) have been undertaken by richer et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2004 ) and bedin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , yielding impressive results .",
    "richer et al . ( 1997 , 2004 ) estimated the fraction of similar - mass photometric binaries to be small ( just 2% in their outer field , falling to just 1% towards the cluster core ) .",
    "milone et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggested a much higher total binary fraction , raising from 10% at the halfmass radius to 15% towards the cluster core .",
    "the present day mass function of the lower - mass ms stars is flat ( bedin et al .",
    "2001 ) , with a slope of @xmath8 and a further flattening towards the cluster centre ( richer et al .",
    "the cluster wds suggest that the initial mass function ( imf ) above 0.8 @xmath9 was much steeper than the present day mass function .",
    "bedin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented the deepest optical colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) to date of this cluster and located the faint end of the wd cooling sequence in m4 at @xmath10 mag , suggesting an age of 11.6@xmath110.6 gyr .",
    "this agrees with the finding of hansen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who found a wd based age of 12.1 gyr .",
    "the ongoing _ hst _ m4 core project ( pi l. bedin , go-12911 ) searches for binary dark companions to ms stars .",
    "the high - accuracy astrometry and photometry of this data - set , together with archival material and a part of the deep near - ir ( nir ) data presented in this paper , have already been used to identify two distinct sequences along the lower - mass ms @xcite .",
    "m4 is also so far the only gc known to host a planetary system , psr b1620 - 26 ( sigurdsson et al .",
    "2003 ) , which challenged the planet - metallicity relation of the standard planet formation model at that time @xcite .",
    "recently , hasegawa & hirashita ( 2014 ) suggested that the critical metallicity for gas giant formation is [ fe / h]@xmath12 dex , which agrees with m4 s metallicity .",
    "beer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested a metallicity - independent formation scenario , in which the planet in m4 formed through dynamically induced instability in a circumbinary disc .",
    "if true , then we can expect many planets to form especially in the dense gcs in which dynamical interactions between cluster stars are ubiquitous . since bds might form in a similar way , we then might also expect that many more bds form in dense gcs compared to open clusters .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ obs ]",
    "we describe the observations and reduction of our nir and archival optical data . in section  [ cmds ]",
    "we present and discuss the nir and optical - nir cmds , and our results and conclusions are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the nir observations of the globular cluster m4 were carried out in april 2012 with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on board the _ hst _ , using the @xmath3 and @xmath13 filters ( program go12602 , pi : dieball ) .",
    "all observations were made at a single pointing position on a field centred at about one core radius north east from the cluster centre .",
    "this region in the cluster had been the focus of the programs go-5461 ( richer et al .",
    "1997 , 2004 ) and go10146 ( bedin et al .",
    "2009 ) and thus is fully covered by deep optical observations .",
    "a standard 4-point wfc3-irdither - box - min dither pattern and a sampling of nsamp14 spars50 was applied during the observations to get a well - sampled point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the wfc3 field of view is @xmath14 in the ir channel , with a resolution of @xmath15 per pixel .",
    "all nir observations were carried out during two consecutive orbits on april 16th ( @xmath3 ) and four orbits on april 20th to 21st ( @xmath13 ) , comprising a total of 8 individual images in @xmath3 and 16 images in @xmath13 , each 653 seconds , resulting in total exposure times of 5223 seconds ( @xmath3 ) and 10447 seconds ( @xmath13 ) .    using the pipeline produced flat - fielded ( flt ) images , we first created a master image for each of our ir filters , using multidrizzle running under pyraf ( the python - based interface to iraf ) .",
    "multidrizzle corrects geometric distortions that are present in the input images and combines them into a master image .",
    "shifts between the individual images are expected , as we have applied a dither pattern .",
    "on top of this , telescope breathing can affect guide star tracking and as a result can cause small shifts , typically on a sub - pixel scale ( see e.g.  the multidrizzle handbook available on the stsci webpages ) . in order to ascertain that all shifts are taken into account",
    ", we created geometric - distortion corrected individual images .",
    "based on the coordinates of the same 10 stars in each of these images ( selected to be well distributed over the field of view ) , accurate shifts between the individual and the master images were then determined using tweakshift .",
    "the master images created in this way are displayed in figures  [ f110 ] and [ f160 ] .",
    "note that these master images serve as reference images for the positions of the stars detected by dolphot , but the photometry was actually performed on the individual images ( see [ dolphot ] below ) .",
    "photometry was performed on the individual flt images using the dolphot software developed by a. dolphin as a generalized version of hstphot @xcite .",
    "dolphot runs on the flt images downloaded from the stsci archive , i.e. , no further processing of the images is necessary nor recommended .",
    "photometry is performed on each of the input images , using the wfc3 module which replaces the analytic psf model with a look - up table computed using tiny tim psfs ( krist & hook 2011 ) . for our data",
    ", we used jay anderson s psf libraries for the wfc3/ir filters and the pixel area maps available from the dolphot webpage .",
    "the wfc3 module also includes a photometric calibration to the vegamag system . as a reference frame for a common physical ( image )",
    "coordinate system we use our deepest image , i.e. , the master image created with multidrizzle .",
    "the dolphot package also provides routines to mask all pixels that are flagged as bad in the data quality arrays , to multiply with the pixel area maps , to calculate sky images , and to align all input images ( or rather the source coordinates found in each input image ) to the reference frame ( our drizzled master images ) using user defined lists of stellar coordinates in each input and the reference image . for these steps , we used the recommended wfc3 ir parameter settings .",
    "note that performing photometry on the drizzled image is expected to provide sub - optimal photometry , because the drizzling process affects the psf and the noise characteristics of the drizzled images . instead ,",
    "dolphot runs on all input images simultaneously and thus is capable of providing deep photometry .",
    "we started with the recommended parameters , and then refined some parameters to push our photometry as deep as possible .",
    "dolphot can run on data from multiple filters and cameras , thus we were able to do the photometry on both @xmath3 and @xmath13 data sets simultaneously .",
    "the output file includes x and y positions , photometric parameters like sharpness , crowding ( the magnitude difference to the measured magnitude if no neighbouring sources would be fit simultaneously ) , the object type , and magnitudes in the vegamag system for all sources detected in the @xmath3 and @xmath13 data .",
    "a calibrated nir cmd is plotted in fig .",
    "[ cmdirall ] . as can be seen",
    ", the cmd is exceptionally deep .",
    "the total catalogue contained 51311 sources , but a large number of those will be spurious detections .",
    "+      among the archival _ hst _ material the only images which offer any hope of detecting bds in the optical are those deep and in the reddest filters available , i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( indeed , technically @xmath182/3 of these pass - bands are already in the nir wavelength range ) .",
    "we extensively searched in the _ hst _ archive , and identified four @xmath191200 seconds deep images taken with acs / wfc in @xmath16 under program go-10146 ( pi : bedin ) as the optimal for our purposes , as those images were taken in low - sky mode , are well dithered , and collected in a well defined epoch in 2005.48 ( i.e. , about 6.8 years before the go-12602 data ) .",
    "images were reduced with the software described in great detail in anderson et al .",
    "briefly , the method is essentially a psf - fitting where all pixels from all images are simultaneously fitted using the appropriate psfs which account for the spatial and temporal shape - variation on each individual image .",
    "the key to the method is an optimal knowledge on how to transform those pixels into a common reference frame and an exquisite empirical psf modeling .",
    "this software is well tested and used in all the twelve works of the series `` the acs survey of galactic globular clusters '' ( see , sarajedini et al.2007 ) .",
    "the first photometric run returned 19990 optical detections .",
    "as the detection of bds might be only marginal in these optical images , we relaxed the finding criteria in a second photometric run , imposing to save all the local maxima , and not only the significant ones , resulting in 1.5 million detections .",
    "although most of these local maxima likely are just fluctuations of the background noise , we can still use them to set an optical upper limit to the nir - detected bd candidates .    for visual inspection of the wds and bd candidates",
    ", stacked images were created from the cte - corrected flt images .",
    "the stacked images have pixels values resulting from median clipping of the cte - corrected flt individual images , and are supersampled by a factor of 2 in each direction ( see anderson et al .",
    "2008 and anderson & bedin 2010 for further details ) .",
    "we used the data in the two nir filters @xmath3 and @xmath13 to create a nir cmd .",
    "as the full nir catalogue contains a large number of spurious detections , we created a best - photometry nir cmd ( described below in sect .",
    "[ nircmds ] ) .",
    "however , since wds and bd candidates have similar magnitudes and colours in the nir , bd candidates can not be distinguished based on the nir data alone .",
    "we then used additional optical f775w data to create proper motion cleaned optical - nir cmds ( see sect .  [ nircmds ] ) in which the wd and ms sequence are clearly separate .",
    "thus , the optical data are used to distinguish the wds from the bd candidates .      in order to produce a clean cmd of only `` good '' stellar sources , we selected the output catalogue in such a way that the faint sources will be dominated by true stellar detections while keeping the number of spurious detections at bay . * * the resulting best - photometry catalogue includes 2526 sources , i.e , @xmath20 of all detections .",
    "the best - photometry cmd is remarkably clean , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cmdirsel ] .",
    "we can clearly see the ms delineating down towards the expected h - burning limit and going beyond that to fainter sources .",
    "note that this cmd is not proper motion cleaned , as we show all nir sources that satisfy our selection criterion on the photometry .",
    "all sources with magnitudes fainter than 24 mag in @xmath3 were visually inspected on the @xmath3 master image , resulting in 177 visually confirmed nir sources around or fainter than the h - burning limit in @xmath3 ( see sect  [ hmass ] below ) .",
    "the ms is narrow between the two ms `` knees ''",
    "( @xmath21 mag and @xmath22 mag ) .",
    "the first `` knee '' occurs around @xmath23 k and a mass of @xmath24 and is due to the formation of molecules in the cool stellar atmospheres , and the second knee is a result of increasing electron degeneracy in the ( sub)-stellar interior close to the h - burning limit ( baraffe et al .",
    "below the second knee , the ms broadens towards fainter and lower - mass ms stars .",
    "indeed , the low - mass ms splits into two branches , as shown in milone et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who had first pointed out multiple stellar generations among vlmss in m4 , based on high - precision deep optical _",
    "data from the _ hst _ m4 core project and our nir data . the split can be clearly seen in the nir cmd ( see milone et al .",
    "2014 , their fig .",
    "2 ) , as opposed to the optical data , demonstrating that the nir is also an ideal waveband to search for multiple sequences along the lowest - mass and hence faintest ms .",
    "note that the goal in milone et al .",
    "( 2014 ) was to search for multiple generations along the low mass ms based on very precise photometry . in contrast , in this paper , our goal is to go deep and well beyond the h - burning limit .    in our fig .",
    "[ cmdirsel ] , we can see the ms delineating further down towards the expected end of the h - burning sequence , marked with red slashed lines and light - red shaded area .",
    "see sect .",
    "[ hmass ] below for a discussion on the mass and nir magnitude at the h - burning limit . around @xmath25 mag",
    "the number of sources on the ms decreases and the ms peters out . on the blue side of the faint ms ,",
    "the wd sequence can be seen , starting around @xmath26 mag and @xmath27 mag and going fainter and redder .",
    "an increase in source number seems to be apparent below @xmath28 mag , i.e. , below the expected end of the h - burning sequence .",
    "this is the area in the cmd where we expect the bds to appear .",
    "this happens to coincide with the wd sequence as well , i.e. , this is the region where wd and bd cooling sequences would be expected to cross .",
    "unfortunately , this also means that we can not disentangle wds and bd candidates based on our nir data alone . in order to help with both cluster membership determination and distinguishing wds and bd candidates ,",
    "the deep optical data from go10146 were used ( see sect .",
    "[ optobs ] and sect ,  [ optnircmds ] ) .",
    "the wd as well as the bd regions have been indicated in fig .",
    "[ cmdirsel ] . for orientation purposes ,",
    "we have plotted a wd sequence ( blue line ) .",
    "the wd cooling sequence was constructed by interpolating on the wood ( 1995 ) grid of theoretical wd cooling curves , adopting a mean wd mass of @xmath29 . using a grid of synthetic da wd spectra kindly provided by b. gnsicke ( see gnsicke et al .",
    "1995 ) we carried out synthetic photometry with pysynphot .",
    "note that we have shifted the wd cooling sequence to get a reasonable match to the underlying cmd .",
    "this required a rather large distance of 2.2 kpc and a reddening of @xmath30 mag ( a standard reddening law ( seaton 1979 ) is built into pysynphot ) .",
    "our cooling sequence starts at @xmath31 k and terminates at @xmath32 , but note that the coolest wds in m4 have temperatures as low as @xmath33 ( bedin et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "in addition , we have marked the location of the known field bd sdss - j125637.13 - 022452.4 @xcite , which has a metallicity similar to m4 but is likely several gyr younger . as a consequence ,",
    "its cooling time is shorter and thus it is expected to be brighter than the m4 bds .",
    "the observed @xmath34- and @xmath35-band magnitudes agree with a 5 gyr old , @xmath36 source at a metallicity of [ m / h]=-0.5 dex .",
    "we scaled the observed @xmath34- and @xmath35-band magnitudes to the wfc3 nir filters and applied m4 s distance and reddening ( following hendricks et al .",
    "2012 , we adopted a reddening of @xmath37 mag , a true distance modulus of 11.28 mag , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) and over - plotted the field bd on our cmd .",
    "its location supports that our data are indeed deep enough to reach well into the bd zone .",
    "two 12 gyr isochrones have been overplotted on the best - photometry cmd , a bt - settl model based on the asplund et al .",

    "note that we do not attempt to derive cluster parameters from the isochrone fitting , instead , we have fit the isochrones by eye so that they best overlap with the underlying cmd for the dartmouth isochrone . for the bt - settl isochrone , we chose a smaller distance modulus of 11 mag and @xmath44 .",
    "the difference in shape of the isochrones , as well as the difference in the best - fit parameters , reflect the differences in the underlying physics , i.e. treatment of the stellar atmospheres including molecules . for a more in - depth discussion of the input physics to the models we refer the reader to the bt - settl and dartmouth webpages and the references given there ( https://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/grids/bt-settl/ and http://stellar.dartmouth.edu/models/ ) . ] .",
    "note also that both sets terminate at a stellar mass of 0.083 @xmath9 ( bt - settl ) or 0.1 @xmath9 ( dartmouth ) , i.e. , they do not reach to the h - burning limit .          our nir and optical catalogues have been matched using a six - parameter linear transformations between the star positions in the different epochs . as reference stars for the transformations we used only well - measured , isolated , non - saturated cluster stars with a high signal - to - noise and low residuals .",
    "the _ predicted positions _ of the first epoch sources in the second epoch are compared with the _ observed positions _ and the displacements between first and second epoch are calculated .",
    "the top panel in figures  [ cmdj ] , [ cmdh ] , [ pmcmdir110 ] and [ pmcmdir160 ] shows the displacements in wfc3/ir , based on the total dolphot nir ( 51311 detections ) and optical ( 19990 sources ) catalogue .",
    "since cluster stars have been used for the reference list , we expect cluster members to agglomerate around zero in the displacement vector point diagram .",
    "indeed , two populations can be distinguished : a dense and tight agglomeration of data points around @xmath45 and @xmath46 which denotes the cluster members , and a more widely spread data region centering around @xmath47 and @xmath48 which denotes field sources .",
    "the latter are mostly bulge sources , reflecting the low tangential motion of m4 around the galactic center ( see also bedin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the corresponding cmds are plotted in the second row in figures  [ cmdj ] , [ cmdh ] , [ pmcmdir110 ] and [ pmcmdir160 ] .",
    "the left cmds show all sources within up to two wfc3 pixels displacement , the middle cmds show only sources with a displacement of no more than 0.1 pixels which suggests that they are cluster members , and all non - cluster sources are shown in the right diagrams .",
    "a displacement of 0.1 pixels corresponds to a proper motion of 1.9 mas / year , based on our timeline of 6.8 years and a pixel scale of 0.13@xmath49 .",
    "this agrees well with e.g.  bedin et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2009 ) and zloczewski et al .",
    "as can be seen , the proper - motion cleaned `` cluster '' cmds ( middle diagrams ) show a well defined ms , terminating around @xmath50 mag in both cmds in figures  [ cmdj ] and  [ cmdh ] , as well as a well defined wd sequence ( light - blue data points ) going down to the bottom of the wd sequence around @xmath2 mag .            on the other hand , the proper - motion cleaned optical - nir cmds do not show any bd candidates , i.e. , sources fainter than @xmath51 mag and redder than @xmath52 or @xmath53 mag ( see also fig .  [ models ] )",
    "this was expected , as the deep optical cmd presented in bedin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) did not show any potential ms sources fainter than the h - burning limit .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of deep _ hst_/wfc3 near - ir ( nir ) imaging data of the globular cluster m4 . the best - photometry nir colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) </S>",
    "<S> clearly shows the main sequence extending towards the expected end of the hydrogen - burning limit and going beyond this point towards fainter sources . </S>",
    "<S> the white dwarf sequence can be identified . as such , this is the deepest nir cmd of a globular cluster to date . </S>",
    "<S> archival _ hst _ </S>",
    "<S> optical data were used for proper - motion cleaning of the cmd and for distinguishing the white dwarfs ( wds ) from brown dwarf ( bd ) candidates . </S>",
    "<S> detection limits in the nir are around @xmath0 mag and @xmath1 mag , and in the optical around @xmath2 mag . </S>",
    "<S> comparing our observed cmds with theoretical models , we conclude that we have reached beyond the h - burning limit in our nir cmd and are probably just above or around this limit in our optical - nir cmds . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any faint nir sources that have no optical counterpart are potential bd candidates , since the optical data are not deep enough to detect them . </S>",
    "<S> we visually inspected the positions of nir sources which are fainter than the h - burning limit in @xmath3 and for which the optical photometry did not return a counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we found in total five sources for which we did not get an optical measurement . for four of these five sources </S>",
    "<S> , a faint optical counterpart could be visually identified , and an upper optical magnitude was estimated . </S>",
    "<S> based on these upper optical magnitude limits , we conclude that one source is likely a wd , one source could either be a wd or bd candidate , and the remaining two sources agree with being bd candidates . for only one source no optical counterpart could be detected , which makes this source a good bd candidate . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that we found in total four good bd candidates . </S>"
