    "the dark matter problem is one of the most important cosmological problems.@xcite one promising candidate for cold dark matter is the axion.@xcite this is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson associated with the peccei - quinn @xmath0 symmetry breaking.@xcite the introduction of this @xmath0 symmetry is the most natural solution for the strong cp problem.@xcite thus the existence of the axion is not only motivated by this problem in particle physics but can also contribute to the cosmological dark matter problem at the same time .",
    "the axion model has two important parameters .",
    "one is the breaking energy scale of the peccei - quinn symmetry , @xmath1 , which determines the magnitude of the axion mass .",
    "the other is the color anomaly , @xmath2 , which is an integer and equal to the number of the ground states of the effective potential for the axion field , which corresponds to the phase of the peccei - quinn field .",
    "the determination of the numerical values of these parameters is closely related to the evolution of the topological defects included in the axion model .    in the axion model context , at the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the peccei - quinn symmetry and at the mass acquisition of the axion around the qcd scale , topological defects are produced in the process of cosmological evolution.@xcite since the peccei - quinn symmetry is a global @xmath0 symmetry , global strings are produced at the scale @xmath1 .",
    "these strings are axionic strings . at the qcd scale",
    ", a @xmath3 discrete symmetry appears through the instanton effect , and this symmetry is broken spontaneously so that two - dimensional topological defects stem from the axionic strings .",
    "these are axionic domain walls and @xmath2 pieces of them stretch out from each axionic string .",
    "when @xmath2 is greater than one , the string - wall system survives long enough so that the energy density of the axionic domain walls dominates the universe , and the standard cosmological evolution description should fail , since multiple walls can stabilize the axionic string network.@xcite therefore the @xmath4 domain wall is not accepted cosmologically and @xmath2 must be unity . when @xmath5 , the axionic domain walls disappear quickly enough not to over - close the universe.@xcite    the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale , @xmath1 , is strictly constrained by considerations of accelerator experiments and various astrophysical and cosmological observations .",
    "the permitted region is given by @xmath6 which is called the axion window.@xcite the upper bound on @xmath1 is found by the constraint that the total amount of the axion should not be contradicted by observational facts , since the axion contribution to the present density depends on @xmath1 .",
    "the main production mechanism of the axion is the collapse of topological defects .",
    "the present energy density of the axion due to axionic strings normalized by the critical density of the universe is estimated to be@xcite@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hubble constant in units of 100  km / sec / mpc , and comparable axions are supplied by the axionic domain walls as@xcite @xmath9 on the other hand , the contribution from the axion field oscillation due to the axion field misalignment is considered to be@xcite @xmath10 which gives a less stringent constraint on @xmath1 than eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ostring ] ) and ( [ eq : owall ] ) do .",
    "the above estimations suggest that in an extreme case the axion window might be tightly closed .",
    "however , some uncertainties are not explicitly expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ostring ] ) other than unknown parameters in the scaling formula of number and size distribution of the axionic strings .",
    "in addition , the estimation ( [ eq : owall ] ) is based on the assumption that one axionic domain wall of horizon size exists within horizon volume , which is inconsistent with the scaling distribution of the axionic strings used in the estimation ( [ eq : ostring ] ) .",
    "first of all the scale - invariant behavior of infinitely long strings and string loops itself is confirmed only by numerical simulations in the case of the local string .",
    "this may be inappropriate since axionic strings are global strings without any gauge field and have unlimitedly spread gradient energy , so that their evolution could be modified from that of the cosmic local strings .",
    "we pay particular attention to whether the damping of the string motion due to the background matter can be neglected and the scaling distribution can be realized .",
    "although the value of the energy which the axion emitted from the axionic string possesses is still controversial,@xcite we concentrate on the uncertainty which depends on the nature of the distribution .    in this paper",
    ", we justify one of the necessary conditions for the scaling behavior of the axionic string evolution .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 is calculated using the same assumption of the defect distribution as the case of @xmath12 , and the importance of the axionic domain wall collapse is verified . in the next section ,",
    "we examine how the scattering amplitude of particles from the string is related to the transition time of the string evolution from the friction regime to the scaling regime .",
    "the interaction cross section between fermions and an axionic string is calculated in @xmath133 .",
    "the axion energy density originating from the axionic domain walls is reexamined in @xmath134 .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "one of the important factors for the establishment of the scaling distribution of axionic strings is that the damping force exerted on them by the radiation background should be negligible so that they move freely by the time of the axionic domain wall formation , @xmath14 .",
    "the temperature at @xmath14 , @xmath15 , is derived from the condition that the axion mass grows greater than the expansion rate of the universe , and the dynamics of the wall are determined by its tension using the temperature dependence of the axion mass,@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the qcd scale .",
    "the expression of @xmath15 is written as@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relativistic degrees of freedom at @xmath20 gev , and @xmath21 is the zero temperature axion mass when @xmath22 gev .    conventional cosmic strings which are suitable for the initial perturbation seeds of the cosmological structures exist in the scaling evolution regime before @xmath14 . their energy scale , however , is typically equal to the grand unification scale,@xcite and it is much higher than that of the axionic string formation , @xmath1",
    ". then it might be possible that the frictional force on the axionic strings remains dominant until @xmath14 .    actually , the temperature of the transition from the friction regime to the scale - invariant regime , @xmath23 , is written as@xcite @xmath24 which is a rough estimation .",
    "it might not be a trivial matter whether @xmath23 is well above @xmath15 and the scaling assumption holds during the entire period of the axion emission from the axionic strings .",
    "the longer the friction regime of the axionic strings lasts , the smaller the contribution from the axionic string loops becomes , since in that case all the energy which the axionic strings have may not be converted to axions",
    ". then the number of the axions produced should decrease and the allowed region of the axion model parameter , @xmath1 , could be extended .",
    "for example , if the loop formation is suppressed and only the infinite strings exist , the expected @xmath12 would be even less than one tenth of the value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ostring ] ) , since the axion energy density from the axionic string loops is much larger than that from the infinite axionic strings.@xcite however , the most dominant contribution from the axionic strings comes from the low temperature phase , that is , the time just before axionic domain wall generation , so that the confirmation that @xmath23 can not be smaller than @xmath15 would be sufficient for the practical estimation of the axion density .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : ttime ] ) is derived by the condition that the tension of the axionic strings , @xmath25 , is balanced with the friction due to the background plasma in the universe , @xmath26 .",
    "the former is written using the line energy density of the string , @xmath27 , and the curvature radius of the string , @xmath28 , by @xmath29 the energy density per unit length of the global string is expressed by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the width scale of the string core , and @xmath32 is the cutoff scale , for example , the mean separation between strings . in calculating the numerical value of the formula ( [ eq : ttime ] ) , we have substituted @xmath33 as @xmath34 , where the parameters are @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 , which is the horizon scale at @xmath14 , that is , the maximum scale of the axionic string length .",
    "the frictional force per unit string length is proportional to the scattering cross section of interacting particles from the axionic string , @xmath37 . with the conventional formula for the local strings ,",
    "@xmath37 is proportional to the inverse of @xmath38 , the momentum of the particle : @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a correction factor which we will calculate in the next section . using the number density of the particles which interact with the axionic string , @xmath41",
    ", the frictional force can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the velocity of the string motion and the momentum transfer is evaluated as @xmath44 .",
    "although the scattering cross section may take various values depending on the species of particle , we temporarily assume that @xmath37 is common to all . then by equating @xmath25 with @xmath26 and assuming that @xmath45",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath46 after substitution of the usual relation between @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the standard cosmology into eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpro ] ) , and using the relation @xmath49 ( that is , the length of the string equals the horizon length ) , we can show @xmath50 one point we would like to note is that the temperature @xmath23 is in inverse proportion to the correction factor of @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , for axionic strings of smaller @xmath27 than that used in the estimation ( [ eq : ttime ] ) due to some kinds of refinement , the factor @xmath51 can approach unity , so that @xmath23 should be much lower .",
    "the evolution of axionic strings may be controlled by the frictional force rather than the string tension even around @xmath15 if @xmath40 is sufficiently large .",
    "when we employ a simple geometric cross section , @xmath40 can be estimated to be @xmath52 .",
    "although we can say this is not disastrous to the scaling approximation , the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath23 is not enormous .",
    "the exact value of @xmath40 should be evaluated by analysis of the interaction between an axionic string and fermions .",
    "the scattering problem of the particles from the string was treated for gauged strings,@xcite the electroweak strings@xcite and the global strings.@xcite however , the interaction of an axionic string with fermions , which is necessary for the calculation of ( [ eq : lsigma ] ) , has not been considered in past work .",
    "particularly , consideration of the case in which the coupling constant is an integer , which is the case in the usual axion model , is missing in the literature .",
    "although the momentum dependence may be predicted as @xmath53,@xcite the numerical factor would be known only after actual calculation .",
    "in this section , the scattering cross section of relativistic fermions from a static , straight , infinitely long axionic string @xmath37 is computed . since the local cosmic string has been the main object of study in this field , a systematic picture for the global string is lacking .",
    "hence we would like to show not only the result but also the calculation procedure briefly .",
    "here we consider the derivative coupling of the axion field with fermions,@xcite where the non - zero vacuum expectation value of the peccei - quinn field does not influence their mass .",
    "the interaction lagrangian is expressed by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a coupling constant , @xmath56 is the axion field , and @xmath57 is a fermion spinor which we regard as massless for simplicity .    in the background , where a global axionic string exists , @xmath56 is spatially dependent . as a result , the dirac equation is altered to the formula @xmath58 when the gamma matrix representation as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is employed , the equations for the upper and lower two components of the spinor are separated as @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 are components of the cylindrical coordinate whose @xmath64-axis coincides with the string axis . in the case of the static , straight , axial symmetric axionic string , @xmath56 depends only on the azimuthal angle @xmath65 . hence @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 must be zero , which are substituted hereafter .    in order to solve the scattering problem , the dirac spinor is decomposed into eigenstates of the angular momentum around the string axis as usual : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the total energy of the fermion , and @xmath71 is the @xmath64-component of the fermion momentum .",
    "the equations for each decomposed spinor are simplified to @xmath72 for right - handed fermions and @xmath73 for left - handed ones .",
    "hereafter we consider the case of right - handed components , since the calculation for left - handed components is almost identical , and the resulting cross section can be applied to the left - handed case .    in a region sufficiently far from the axionic string ,",
    "the axion field takes the value of the solution for the static , straight , infinitely long and axially symmetric string .",
    "that is , @xmath74 for the string whose winding number is one .",
    "then the spatial derivative of @xmath56 is expressed by @xmath75 for the cylindrical coordinate which we adopt",
    ". then the differential equations ( [ eq : right1 ] ) and ( [ eq : right2 ] ) take the form of bessel equations as @xmath76 and the solutions for @xmath77 and @xmath78 are written by the bessel functions as @xmath79 when @xmath55 is not an integer and @xmath80 when @xmath55 is an integer , where the argument of the above functions , @xmath81 , is defined by @xmath82 the subscript , @xmath83 , is defined by @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 are arbitrary constants , and @xmath87    we consider the incoming plain wave as the boundary condition at the region infinitely far from the axionic string for the purpose of calculating the scattering cross section .",
    "the combination of the plain wave which proceeds in the direction of @xmath88-axis and the scattered cylindrical wave is written as @xmath89 for the case in which the plain wave comes from negative infinity and @xmath90 for that when the plain wave comes from positive infinity .",
    "we can obtain the scattering cross section of the fermion from the string per unit string length , @xmath37 , as @xmath91 using the coefficients of the scattered wave .    in order to evaluate @xmath92",
    ", we must determine the inside boundary condition at the string core .",
    "for this purpose we employ the step - function - like configuration at @xmath93 .",
    "that is , the axion field takes a trivial value in the interior of the string core , @xmath94 , and assumes the value corresponding to distances infinitely far from the string in the exterior of the string core . under the condition that the spinors are regular at the origin , @xmath95",
    ", the solutions inside the string core are written as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "then the coefficient @xmath92 can be determined by the junction condition between the internal solution and the external solution at @xmath93 .",
    "the results are summarized as follows ( where @xmath98 is the fermion momentum perpendicular to the string axis and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the solutions in the case that @xmath55 is not an integer are @xmath100 / b_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath101 oriented incoming wave and @xmath102 / b_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath103 oriented incoming wave , where @xmath104 those in the case that @xmath55 is an integer are @xmath105 for the @xmath101 oriented incoming wave and @xmath106 for the @xmath103 oriented incoming wave .",
    "finally when @xmath107 , which holds in a universe whose temperature is sufficiently lower than @xmath1 , the scattering cross section can be deduced as @xmath108 for a non - integer @xmath55 , which has the same form as the aharonov - bohm cross section,@xcite and @xmath109 for an integer @xmath55 , which has a form similar to everett s cross section.@xcite the important features that @xmath37 is proportional to the inverse of @xmath110 , the logarithmic dependence on @xmath111 appears when the coupling charge is an integer , and the sine of the charge itself is multiplied in the contrary case , resemble very much that of the electroweak string.@xcite when the mass of the fermions is included , the helicity flip cross section and the helicity conserving cross section will be defined as is the electroweak string case , and the essential properties of the total cross section would not be changed .",
    "although the above result shows that @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath112 rather than the total momentum , the calculation of @xmath23 , the temperature when the friction regime finishes , should not be modified , since the momentum transfer in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff ] ) is replaced by @xmath113 , and the subsequent procedure is identical .",
    "the correction factor , @xmath40 , which is determined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lsigma ] ) is equal to @xmath114    when @xmath115 , @xmath40 decreases extremely rapidly .",
    "thus when @xmath55 is an integer or a sufficiently small non - integer , the interaction of the axionic strings with the background fermions is fairly strongly suppressed , so that the frictional force becomes insignificant much earlier than the time of the axionic domain wall formation , @xmath14 . even in a parameter range",
    "in which @xmath55 is nearly a half - integer , @xmath40 is at most approximately 2 .",
    "the correction factor can not be much larger than unity , and the estimation of @xmath23 in the representation ( [ eq : ttime ] ) is not completely unreasonable .",
    "hence @xmath116 is shown to be a good approximation .",
    "now the wall number density can be explicitly calculated using the distribution formula of the axionic strings .",
    "once the scaling approximation is justified , we can utilize numerical simulations of strings in which the frictional force they experience is not included .",
    "then the numerical values of the parameters in the string distribution formula enable the quantitative estimation of the axion density from the axionic domain walls .",
    "until now , the wall contribution has been neglected,@xcite or its treatment is based on a naive simplification.@xcite as we will see , this contribution is not minor compared with the string contribution .    in the framework of the one - scale model ,",
    "the smoothing of the small scale structure of infinitely long strings which supplies additional string loops , and the energy loss of loops occur continuously .",
    "the resulting energy density of the strings has certain formulae , although some model parameters are left inexactly determined.@xcite    first , the energy density of infinitely long axionic strings at @xmath14 is written as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the inverse squared correlation scale , since we can expect that the large - scale string network should be formulated by brownian random walks .",
    "its numerical value has been estimated to be @xmath119 by numerical simulations of cosmic strings.@xcite    on the other hand , in order to determine the size and number distribution for the loops , we must acquire the complete formula of that for the loops created from the long strings .",
    "however , such a determination is beyond current computational power",
    ". therefore we utilize the simple assumption that all loops have the same relative size to the horizon length . then the energy density contribution from the axionic string loops during the radiation dominated era in the interval from @xmath120 to @xmath121",
    "is expressed by @xmath122 which is valid for the range of length @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the assumed loop creation size at @xmath47 .",
    "although the lower bound of the region where the above formula is effective should be defined by the minimum size of the loop , we set it to zero .",
    "this does not affect the final conclusion .",
    "the normalization factor , @xmath125 , is defined by @xmath126 where the parameter @xmath127 is defined by the velocity of the strings . using the value of the velocity dispersion of the cosmic string motion ,",
    "@xmath128 obtained by string simulations , @xmath129 can be deduced.@xcite the radiation back - reaction scale @xmath130 is derived as @xmath131 which defines the energy loss rate of a string loop and suggests that the lifetime of a loop created at @xmath47 should be approximately @xmath132.@xcite the parameter in this formula is the efficiency factor of the axion emission power from the axionic string loops , @xmath133 , and it should be determined by numerical simulations of global strings as @xmath134.@xcite the numerical value of @xmath135 ranges from @xmath136 to @xmath137 , according to the variation of @xmath14 due to @xmath1 .    before we proceed to the calculation of @xmath11 ,",
    "let us review the result for @xmath12 briefly .",
    "the following numerical value is basically quoted from ref .",
    "@xcite , but the normalization is different ; the expression of @xmath125 is replaced by that in ref . @xcite and",
    "the estimation is carried out at @xmath14 , not @xmath138 when the line energy of the horizon size loop becomes equivalent to the surface energy of the domain wall surrounded by this loop : @xmath139 here the surface energy density of the axionic domain wall is written as@xcite @xmath140 using the energy density of long strings ( [ eq : rhols ] ) , the density parameter due to the contribution of the axions produced by infinitely long axionic string decay is rewritten as @xmath141 where the common normalization factor to all @xmath142 is defined by @xmath143 note that @xmath144 is independent of @xmath135 since the long string distribution is determined only by @xmath118 . on the other hand , using the energy density of loops ( [ eq : rholp ] ) , the density parameter of the axions by the loop decay source is also rewritten as @xmath145\\left(\\frac{c_a}{0.4}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_a}{65}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\zeta}{13}\\right)\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : ostloop}\\ ] ] the ratio of @xmath146 to @xmath144 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ostring ] with the conventional values of the parameter such as @xmath147.@xcite evidently the contribution from the loops is dominant in the range of reasonable parameter values .    the energy density of the axions from the axionic domain wall when they become non - relativistic can be calculated using that at @xmath14 , @xmath148 , as @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the scale factor and @xmath151 is the averaged energy of the emitted axions from the walls at @xmath14 .",
    "we have obtained the relation @xmath152 in simulations of the axionic domain walls.@xcite thus @xmath11 will be estimated using this numerical value .",
    "we can rewrite the formula ( [ eq : rhols ] ) as @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the characteristic length scale of the string network , so that we can easily regard this as being equal to the averaged distance between the axionic domain walls and at the same time , their mean radius .",
    "thus the energy density of the axionic domain walls attached to the long axionic strings is derived as @xmath155 and the axion density due to these walls is estimated to be @xmath156 we can expect that by a string loop of length @xmath120 , a piece of wall of area @xmath157 surrounded by the incident loop , will be created .",

    "we can see this property in fig .",
    "[ fig : owall ] more clearly .",
    "this is because that the larger a defect grows , the more dominant the wall energy becomes in relation to the string energy .",
    "the dependence on @xmath135 implies that when @xmath162 is constant , a larger value of @xmath135 and also of @xmath163 is favorable for the greater share of the walls attached to loops .",
    "this can be interpreted as the effect that the larger loop creation size must be important since the wall piece distribution at a certain time @xmath14 is in question in the wall case .",
    "the distinct feature compared with the string contribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : ostring ] is that @xmath164 becomes smaller as @xmath162 increases .",
    "this can be explained , roughly speaking , by noting that the energy density of walls is a remnant of the axionic string energy , so a decrease in the efficiency of the axion emission from the strings implies an increase in the amount of energy possessed by the axionic domain walls",
    ".    finally we compare @xmath165 with @xmath12 + @xmath166 , which is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : oratio ] .",
    "the ratio takes the form @xmath167\\left(\\frac{c}{0.4}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_a}{65}\\right)}\\left(\\frac{\\zeta}{13}\\right)^{-1/2}\\ , \\label{eq : oratio}\\ ] ] and it satisfies @xmath168 which means the wall contribution is larger than or comparable to that of the strings .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ fig : oratio ] shows the case when @xmath169 , we can not distinguish its appearance from the other parameter value cases , such as @xmath170 or @xmath171 .",
    "this is because the dominant contribution from axionic domain walls is that from the walls of long strings which is independent of @xmath135 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : owlong ] ) , and the string contribution also depends only on @xmath162 , which can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ostloop ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that all the energy density contribution is in proportion to the square root of the estimation time : @xmath172 so that the total amount of the axion would be twice as large as the value obtained in this paper if we were to calculate it at @xmath138 , which is employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since @xmath173 .",
    "the relative fraction of the axionic domain wall contribution , however , is invariant even when the time of the final string expiration and the wall collapse would be shifted .",
    "we may say that the energy density of the axions produced by the axionic domain walls which stem from the long axionic strings yields the most dominant contribution to the present axion density among the axion production mechanisms by the topological defects .",
    "we have investigated whether the scale - invariant distribution of the axionic strings is realized .",
    "this is very important in the estimation of the axion production by axionic string radiation . as the key element in the confirmation or refutation of this assumption",
    ", the scattering cross section of the relativistic fermions from the axionic string has been calculated using a simple model with a generic form of interaction .",
    "the one - scale model conjecture can be justified when the peccei - quinn charges of the particles are properly chosen so that the friction regime of the axionic strings ends up at an energy scale which is much higher than that when the axionic domain wall rules the evolution of the wall - string system .",
    "for instance , the hadronic axion has only slight interactions with the leptons .",
    "then the scatter of these particles can be neglected , which means the correction factor becomes effectively small , and @xmath23 increases . even if the parameter @xmath55 has an amplitude of order 1 , which is the most natural choice in various models , the era near @xmath15 when the main contribution from the axions of the axionic string origin is radiated does not seem to be in the friction regime .    since the scaling distribution of the axionic string",
    "is shown to be more plausible , the axion energy density due to the axionic domain walls can be calculated using the wall distribution inferred from it .",
    "consequently , we have found that the wall contribution , @xmath11 , is not less important than @xmath12 within the region of reasonable values of the model parameter and the estimation time .",
    "the relative importance of the walls stuck to the infinitely long strings reflects the property of a wall that it is a two - dimensional defect and its energy is proportional to the area surrounded by the string .",
    "note that the ratio ( [ eq : oratio ] ) is proportional to @xmath174 and the numerical value , @xmath175 , is evaluated by simulations of gauged strings . in the case of global axionic strings ,",
    "a long - range interaction would make the smoothing scale larger , i.e. , @xmath118 should be much smaller",
    ". then the ratio of @xmath11 to @xmath12 grows greater , although their absolute amplitudes decrease .",
    "if the line energy density of the axionic string , @xmath27 , could be reduced , the friction dominant era of the axionic strings would continue so long that the string distribution around @xmath15 might be modified as the relation ( [ eq : tpropo ] ) indicates .",
    "in such a situation , the energy density of the loop tends to be small .",
    "the dominance of @xmath11 over the string contribution is , however , preserved as long as a certain quantity of the horizon scale string remains .    in any case , the evolution of the axionic strings and their manner of distribution should be analyzed in detail . since the axionic strings are global strings , they have wide extended line energy density , and this may affect the estimation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in addition to the enhanced smoothing . even if the scaling distribution is correct , the actual calculation of @xmath142 is indispensable in the evaluation of the parameters such as the minimal loop - size and the energy loss rate by the gravitational waves , which are concerned with the ambiguity of the typical size and the number density of the strings .",
    "moreover , the true energy spectrum of radiated axions is also closely connected with the string dynamics .",
    "further investigation of axionic strings must be made carefully in order to provide precise constraints on the axion model .",
