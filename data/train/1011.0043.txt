    "the data one has about a particular matrix are not based on the trace of the matrix , but rather on some other analytical information : the spectrum or pseudospectrum , the numerical range or polynomial numerical hull , the singular values , a unitarily invariant norm , and so forth .",
    "our concern in the present paper is with a solution to the unitary similarity problem that is based on a particular choice of unitarily invariant norm .",
    "let @xmath7 be the space of all @xmath0 complex matrices ; we denote the unitary group by @xmath8 .",
    "two matrices @xmath9 are unitarily similar , which we express by @xmath10 , if there is a @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "the norm under study is defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spectral radius of @xmath15 .",
    "the norm has the property that @xmath16 , for all @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and it coincides with the largest singular value of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath17 is considered as a linear transformation on the complex inner product space @xmath19 with respect to the standard inner product @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , then @xmath22    let @xmath23 denote the ring of polynomials with complex coefficients .",
    "if @xmath10 , then necessarily @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath9 are such that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , then @xmath2 and @xmath1 yield to the same matrix analysis :    \\(i ) @xmath2 and @xmath1 have the same spectrum ;    \\(ii ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 have the same condition numbers , for all nonspectral @xmath28 in the complex plane ;    \\(iii ) @xmath2 and @xmath1 have the same polynomial numerical hulls and , in particular , the same numerical range ;    \\(iv ) @xmath2 and @xmath1 have the same spectral set ;    \\(v ) @xmath2 and @xmath1 have the same pseudospectrum .",

    "if one drops the requirement that @xmath36 be toeplitz , yet remain upper triangular and unicellular , then the values of @xmath37 , for @xmath25 , are insufficient to identify @xmath36 up to unitary similarity ( proposition [ ws ] ) . but with our second main result , theorem [ main result ] , we augment the criterion slightly to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions that classify unicellular matrices up to unitary similarity ( see , also , proposition [ si ] ) .",

    "let us consider one of its consequences , namely corollary [ alg iso ] below , which is of interest in linear - algebraic analysis .",
