    "the research in the field of nanoparticles is the basis for the development of nanotechnology @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the possibility of modifying the physical properties of these systems through the control of the system size .",
    "silver nanoparticles are particularly interesting because they have a number of exciting potential applications in various fields including electronics and biology @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the structure of a material determines its properties .",
    "for instance , in bulk face - centered cubic materials the formation of other structures is suppressed kinetically , whereas nanoparticles of the same materials exhibit different structural modifications such as icosahedron , decahedron and amorphous with a great variety of physical and chemical properties @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to understand the structure of metal nanoparticles , obtained from liquid phase , it is important to investigate their structural evolution during solidification under different conditions .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have proved to be among the most effective methods in the investigation ( at atomic level ) of the properties of nanoparticles , which is difficult to carry out experimentally .",
    "in fact , the structural evolution during cooling of metallic nanoparticles was extensively studied employing md @xcite . for the case of silver nanoparticles one can find some works about , for instance , investigations of the most stable structures and the melting process of small silver clusters @xcite , as well as the superheating of ag nanowires @xcite .",
    "the freezing of silver clusters and nanowires has also been studied recently @xcite . in such work",
    "the authors conclude that the final structure of ag clusters of @xmath32.3 nm is a fcc polyhedron despite the different cooling rates employed .",
    "in contrast , the study of the cooling rate dependence of solidification microstructures of silver by tian @xcite indicates that the cooling rate plays a crucial effect on the silver structure of the solid state . for this case",
    ", they find a critical cooling rate for crystal forming of @xmath31.0@xmath4 .",
    "baletto @xcite analyzed the equilibrium structure and melting of some magic number ag nanoparticles , concluding that for relatively large clusters the fcc polyhedron is the most stable .",
    "however , according to experimental results of reinhard @xcite , both icosahedral and fcc structures are observed in large ( up to 10 nm in diameter ) free ag clusters produced in an inert - gas - aggregation source .",
    "hence , details of thermal stability , melting and freezing temperature for nanosized non equilibrium systems still remain unclear . in this work",
    ", we investigate the structural transitions of silver nanoparticles during fast cooling .",
    "the structural changes have been simulated employing a tight - binding many - body potential .",
    "furthermore , the possible changes of the electronic properties of silver nanoparticles at different temperatures were analyzed by calculating the electronic density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec . 2 is devoted to present the details of the md simulations , the structural analysis , and the hamiltonian model for the calculation of the dos .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "some concluding remarks are provided in section 4 .",
    "the ag nanoparticles are simulated by md methods employing the many - body potentials developed by rosato @xcite on the basis of the second - moment approximation to the tight - binding model ( sma - tb ) . in this framework ,",
    "the band energy of an atom @xmath5 in a given position is proportional to the square root of the second moment of the local density of states .",
    "the energy of this atom is then written as a sum of two terms : @xmath6 where @xmath7\\rbrace^{1/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath8 as an effective hopping integral , @xmath9 the distance between the atom @xmath5 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 the cut - off radius for the interaction , @xmath12 the first - neighbour distance , and @xmath13 describes the distance dependence of the hopping integral . the second term in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) is the repulsive energy of the born - mayer type : @xmath14,\\ ] ] the model parameters ( @xmath15 ) are fitted to the bulk properties of the metal .",
    "the cut - off distance of the atomic interaction is set between the second and third neighbour distance .",
    "the parameters used in the simulation are taken from @xcite ; i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "the md simulations of a silver nanoparticle are carried out for a cubic box without periodic boundary conditions , so that the nanoparticle surface is free .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated in time using a velocity verlet algorithm .",
    "energy conservation with an error less than @xmath17 was achieved with a time step of 6.4 fs .",
    "the almost spherical nanoparticle was prepared by cutting a spherical region of a desired radius from a big face centered cubic crystal .",
    "we have considered silver nanoparticles of different sizes ranging from 147 atoms up to 2869 atoms , but the results presented here are for systems of 2869 atoms , , ( in some cases we also present results for nanoparticles of 147 atoms , ag@xmath18 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath19 ( and 147 ) belongs to the set of magic numbers for icosahedral symmetries @xcite . in order to obtain an equilibrium liquid - like state for the nanoparticle , we start the simulation at 1500 k which is a temperature higher than the equilibrium melting temperature of the nanoparticle ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the system is kept at this temperature for @xmath21 time steps ( 640 ps ) .",
    "six different quenching processes are then carried out .",
    "the overall cooling rate was controlled by changing the number of md steps at each run . as our first cooling process we chose a slow one in which the system is cooled from a liquid state at 1500 k to a temperature of 300 k employing @xmath22 md steps , which corresponds to a cooling rate of ( @xmath23 process ) . in the last one , a fast cooling process , we employ @xmath24 md steps , which corresponds to a cooling rate of ( @xmath25 process ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recently chen @xcite employed the same cooling rates ( @xmath23 , and @xmath25 ) to study the structure and dynamics of a gold nanoparticle of similar size ( 2112 atoms ) .",
    "thus , we consider these two cooling rates as our extreme cases so that we can compare the results for both nanoparticles .",
    "the other four cooling rates @xmath26 were chosen such that @xmath27 .",
    "on cooling , the temperature was decreased to room temperature ( 300 k ) by steps of @xmath28 .",
    "the internal energy and structural configurations are recorded during the simulation .      *",
    "the pair correlation function*. the pair correlation function ( pcf ) @xmath29 has been widely used to describe the atomic structure in amorphous , liquid and crystalline states .",
    "this quantity is given by @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the atomic density ( n / v ) , and @xmath32 is the average number of atoms within a spherical shell surrounded by @xmath33 and @xmath34 around an arbitrary atom . + * pair analysis technique*. the common neighbours analysis ( cna ) technique , introduced by honeycutt and anderson @xcite , is a standard tool for the interpretation of molecular dynamics simulations of structural transformations .",
    "the local environment of a pair of atoms is characterized by a set of four indexes ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the first one indicates whether the pair of atoms are closer than a given cutoff distance @xmath11 . in the present work @xmath11",
    "is chosen to be equal the semisum of the first and second nearest neighbours distance in the perfect fcc ag lattice , that is @xmath11 = 0.35 nm .",
    "the second index @xmath10 is the number of common neighbours to the two atoms , and the third one is the number of bonds between the common neighbours .",
    "the fourth index is added to provide a unique correspondence between number and diagrams @xcite .",
    "for instance , the 1551 pairs characterize the icosahedral - like local structure whereas the 1421 and 1422 pairs represent the fcc - like and hcp - like local structures , respectively .",
    "additionally , icosahedral and fcc systems with structural defects are characterized by the 1541 and 1431 pairs , respectively .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that pairs are named as type i if @xmath36 and type ii otherwise .      in order to calculate the electronic properties of silver nanoparticles we employ a _ tight - binding _ hamiltonian given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the orthonormal ( atomic - like ) basis set centered at the site @xmath39 with one orbital @xmath40 in each site .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath41 are defined by @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 as the on - site and hopping terms , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the same parameter employed in the cna technique ( see above ) .",
    "the atomic positions @xmath45 , known from the md simulation ( see section [ atstr ] ) , are fixed for these calculations .",
    "a physically relevant quantity for the study of the electronic properties of the system under study is the density of states projected on the atomic position @xmath46 , also known as the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "this quantity can be determined from @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the diagonal element of the one - particle green function @xmath49 .",
    "the recursion procedure is a real - space technique to tridiagonalize a symmetric ( hermitian ) hamiltonian such that @xmath50 can be expressed as a continued fraction formed by the so - called recursion coefficients .",
    "details about the recursion method can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this procedure allows us to collect ldos in differente ways .",
    "considering that an atom in a fcc - solid have 12 first neighbours , for the nanoparticle we sum all the ldos corresponding to atoms with 12 neighbours within @xmath11 ( fcc - like dos , fdos ) .",
    "thus , in a well ordered nanoparticle with fcc - like structure the fdos will be the main contribution to the total dos . in this way we can compare the structural and electronic changes during the transformation .",
    "the nanoparticle is initially in the liquid state forming a nanodrop of approximately 4.4 nm diameter . as a result of quenching at different cooling rates we obtain , at 300 k , nanoparticles either in a crystal - like ( cooling rate @xmath51 ) or metallic glass ( cooling rate @xmath52 ) structure , as illustrated qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . an imperfect nanocrystal with noticeable faceted morphology",
    "is obtained at a lower cooling rate ( @xmath23 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) and ( b ) . at a fast cooling rate ( @xmath25 )",
    "nucleation of equilibrium phases are suppressed , and atoms exhibit random arrangements .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the variation of the average internal energy , @xmath53 , as a function of temperature for various cooling rates . at a cooling rate of @xmath51the internal energy undergoes a sharp variation as the temperature decreases from approximately 600 to 500 k. as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the transformation from liquid to crystal occurs in a wide temperature range ( 650 - 450 k ) : the peak of the heat capacity curve @xmath54 , located at 527 k , is not sharp . on the other hand , at a cooling rate of @xmath52the caloric curve @xmath53 has no inflexion in the whole temperature range .",
    "the continuous change of the curve indicates that the system does not suffer structural changes ; i.e. an amorphous solid is obtained in the undercooling state .",
    "the reason for this is that high cooling rate restricts the atomic diffusion .",
    "this behavior is very similar to that reported by chen @xcite for a gold nanoparticle of 2112 atoms .",
    "the critical cooling rate , @xmath55 , is the minimum value which is necessary to avoid crystallization . for the nanoparticle we estimate @xmath55 from the analysis of the time evolution of the energy , @xmath56 , as well as its temperature evolution , @xmath57 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) , and the corresponding pcfs @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we obtain the value of @xmath58 . although this value is close to that obtained for solid silver @xcite , @xmath55 depends on the size of the nanoparticle .",
    "it is also noticeable that the silver nano glass , obtained at the cooling rate of , is very unstable .",
    "for instance , at room temperature after 6.4 ps the nano glass transforms to the crystal - like structure in agreement with @xcite .",
    "nanoparticle for various cooling rates .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the pcf at several temperatures and for the @xmath23 and @xmath25 cooling rates .",
    "first , in the temperature interval from 1500 to 600 k , we note for both cooling processes that the pcfs are identical , and reveal the typical structural features of an amorphous liquid with short - range topological ordering . at the cooling rate of the amorphous structure of the nanoparticle is conserved down to room temperature . as temperature decreases , it is clearly noticeable the splitting of the second peak in the pcf , which is characteristic of amorphous structures @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the pcf of the nanoparticles cooled at a rate of , below 500 k shows a typical structure corresponding to the fcc crystal .",
    "more detailed information on the atomic structure in the can be obtained using cna . at the beginning liquid state ( 1500 k ) , the most abundant pairs are 1201 ( 21% ) , 1311 ( 21% ) , 1101 ( 12% ) , and 1422 ( 5.7% ) , for type i ; and 2101 , 2211 pairs , for type ii . figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] show the variation of the relative numbers of several principal bonded pairs versus temperature .",
    "quantities are normalized such that the total numbers of pairs with @xmath36 is unity . for temperatures above 650 k",
    "the number of principal pairs decreases slowly , but in the same proportion , after increasing the temperature which occurs independently of the cooling proceses ( @xmath23 or @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is an indication that the structure of the nanoparticle is not changing appreciably , which is in agreement with the pcfs analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "however , for temperatures below @xmath3625 k the nanoparticle , cooled at a rate of , undergo drastic structural changes .",
    "the number of 1421 pairs increases from 8% to 50% when the temperature decreases from 625k to 450 k , while the number of 1431 pairs , which represents defect - fcc structure , practically falls to zero .",
    "furthermore , the number of 1541 and 1551 bonded pairs increases equally , when temperature decreases to 625 k , for both @xmath23 and @xmath25 cooling processes .",
    "below this temperature the ratio of 1541 and 1551 pairs falls practically to zero for a relatively slow cooling rate of , while for a faster cooling process ( e.g. @xmath25 ) , the ratio of these pairs increases , reaching values of 12% , and 9% at room temperature , respectively ( see figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "it seems that a low cooling rate allows the reorganization of the atomic order .",
    "as the present simulation reveals , the fcc crystalline silver nanoparticle of 4.4 nm size is more stable than an icosahedral one , which is consistent with the results of baletto @xcite .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the cna of a gold nanoparticle of 2112 atoms @xcite . in the case of the small nanoparticle of 147 atoms the number of 1422 pairs , corresponding to hcp - like structures , increases up to 35% ( 300 k ) whereas the number of 1421 and 1551 pairs reach the values of @xmath59% at room temperatures . in summary , for the small ( 147 atoms ) and large ( 2869 atoms ) nanoparticles predominate , after the transition , the fcc - like and hcp - like structures , respectively .",

    "this changes completely at 300 k. for the @xmath23 cooling rate , the total dos at room temperature is slightly more similar to the dos of the fcc - solid sample ( not shown here ) , especially for the main peak at @xmath66 , which is not observed in the case for @xmath25 .",
    "this should indicate , in agreement with the analysis of the atomic order ( see previous sub - section ) , that the silver nanoparticle with a slow cooling rate becomes more ordered ( close to its solid counterpart ) after decreasing the temperature .",
