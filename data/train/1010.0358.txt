    "there is a natural function on moduli space , called the systole function , which associates to a hyperbolic surface the length of its shortest non - trivial closed curve .",
    "unless the hyperbolic surface is topologically a pair of pants , the curve in question is a simple closed geodesic generally called the systole or the systolic loop .",
    "although there exist surfaces with arbitrarily small systole , the systole function is bounded over any given moduli space ( of complete finite area surfaces of a given signature ) .",
    "furthermore via mumford s compactness theorem , there is ( at least ) a surface in each moduli space which realizes the maximum length systole .",
    "the study of these surfaces , and more generally the study of critical points of the systole function , largely initiated by schmutz schaller @xcite , has generated quite a bit of interest and can be thought of as a type of hyperbolic sphere packing problem .",
    "notable results include a sharp upper bound on the systole among all surfaces of genus @xmath0 @xcite , the fact that principal congruence subgroups of @xmath1 give rise to global maxima in their respective signatures @xcite and akrout s theorem that the systole function is in fact a topological morse function @xcite ( partial results previously due to schmutz schaller @xcite ) .    if we define @xmath2 ( or more generally @xmath3 ) to be the maximum length of a systole among all hyperbolic surfaces of genus @xmath4 ( resp . of genus",
    "@xmath4 with @xmath5 cusps ) , it is also an interesting question to ask how these constants grow as a function of topology . as it turns out ,",
    "the more interesting question is how these constants grow as a function of genus , because for large enough @xmath5 , they cease to grow @xcite .",
    "note that the systole length of a closed hyperbolic surface is exactly twice the length of the minimum injectivity radius .",
    "thus if a surface has a systole of length @xmath6 , then around any point of the surface , there is an embedded open disk of radius @xmath7 . by considering the area of a disk around a point in the hyperbolic plane , which grows roughly exponentially in radius",
    ", one immediately sees that the systole function is bounded by roughly @xmath8 . in the more general case of closed riemannian surfaces with area normalized to @xmath9 ,",
    "the result is also true and this is a theorem of gromov @xcite .",
    "conversely , there are constructions of families of surfaces , one in each genus , where the systoles grow roughly like @xmath8 .",
    "the first of these constructions was due to buser and sarnak @xcite , and there have been others since @xcite .",
    "both buser - sarnak , and gromov in the more general setting of riemannian metrics , also considered the homological systole @xmath10 , i.e. , the shortest homologically non - trivial curve on a surface @xmath11 of genus @xmath4 .",
    "of course one has the obvious inequality @xmath12 for any surface @xmath11 and it is easy to construct surfaces where the inequality is an equality , resp .",
    "where the inequality is strict .",
    "notice that the embedded disk argument above does not necessarily give a homologically non - trivial curve . nonetheless , as in the case of the homotopy systole , it is not too difficult to find a rough @xmath8 upper bound on the homology systole of a hyperbolic surface of genus @xmath4 @xcite . again , the rough @xmath8 bound remains true in the setting of riemannian metrics of normalized area @xcite .",
    "the goal of this note is to observe that in any signature , there are surfaces which realize the supremum of the homological systole function @xmath13 ( @xmath14 in the closed case ) and that in the closed and once - punctured cases , these are the same surfaces that realize the maximum homotopy systole .",
    "specifically , in section [ sec : proof ] , the following is shown .",
    "[ thm : main ] if @xmath11 is maximal for @xmath15 among all closed genus @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "genus @xmath4 with one cusp ) hyperbolic surfaces , then it is maximal for @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , it is clear that one can not hope to generalize the above result to arbitrary signature . indeed , via buser s hairy torus examples @xcite , one can construct a family of surfaces of genus @xmath19 with @xmath5 cusps with homology systoles of length roughly @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , the homotopy systole of a surface of genus @xmath19 , no matter how many cusps it has , is uniformly bounded . in section [ sec : mul ] , this example is adapted to arbitrary genus to show @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "we ll begin by showing that like the usual systole , the homological systole admits a maximum over the moduli space of genus @xmath4 hyperbolic surfaces with @xmath5 cusps . for the systole function , this is an immediate consequence of the continuity of the systole function and mumford s compactness theorem @xcite which states the set of surfaces with injectivity radius bounded below is a compact subset of moduli space .",
    "here we need to be more careful because a priori surfaces could be arbitrarily close to the supremum of the homological systole and have a an arbitrarily small systole ( which in this case would be homologically trivial ) .",
    "the following lemma will allow us to again apply mumford s compactness theorem . before stating the lemma , we set @xmath23 to be the set of all surfaces of genus @xmath4 with systole bounded below by @xmath24 and @xmath25 to be the set of all surfaces with systole strictly less than @xmath24 .

    "the collar lemma @xcite ensures that if a simple closed geodesic @xmath40 is sufficiently short , then any simple closed geodesic that intersects it transversally is long ( where long depends only on how short the geodesic is ) .",
    "in particular , as @xmath16 is bounded above over @xmath41 , if @xmath42 is less than a certain constant @xmath43 ( which depends only on the topology ) then all of the surface s homological systoles are disjoint from @xmath42 .",
    "we can now apply lemma [ lem : lel ] to increase the ( homologically trivial ) systoles of @xmath11 by some small @xmath44 which will give us a new surface with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this process can be repeated until either the systole of the surface is now @xmath47 , or there is a homological systole which crosses each of the homologically trivial systoles . in the latter case , both the homologically trivial and non - trivial systoles are at least of length equal to the constant @xmath43 .",
    "we set @xmath48 and the lemma is proved .",

    "this operation does not decrease the girth of the graph .",
    "we view the resulting graph as the graph of a pants decomposition , and construct a surface by inserting ( hyperbolic ) pants with boundary lengths all equal to @xmath66 in the usual way , without paying any attention to twist parameters . the resulting surface @xmath67 has a single boundary geodesic of length @xmath66 .",
    "to obtain a surface with @xmath0 cusps , we glue a pair of pants with @xmath0 cusps and a boundary geodesic of length @xmath66 along the boundary geodesic of @xmath67 . as an illustration ,",

    "our claim is that the systoles of this surface are exactly the @xmath69 ( @xmath70 in the @xmath63 case ) geodesics of length @xmath66 which were the boundary geodesics of the pants .",

    "we begin by taking any curve @xmath42 that crosses one of the curves @xmath75 and has an arc @xmath52 that leaves and comes back on the same side of @xmath75 .",
    "( in the event where this curve is @xmath72 we consider the arc of @xmath42 not contained in the pair of pants with @xmath0 cusps . )",
    "we replace @xmath52 with the unique shortest geodesic @xmath76 in the free homotopy class where the endpoints are allowed to slide on @xmath75 .",
    "now @xmath76 separates @xmath75 into two arcs , one of which , say @xmath77 , has length less than @xmath78 . via standard hyperbolic trigonometric arguments , the unique geodesic in the homotopy class of @xmath79 has length less than @xmath80 , thus less than @xmath81 , and less than @xmath82 .",
    "it follows that we can restrict our attention to curves that do nt have this  backtracking \" property .",
    "such curves describe non - trivial cycles in the underlying graph , and have cycle length at least @xmath62 .",
    "it follows that they pass through at least @xmath62 pairs of pants and as a consequence , their length is at least @xmath62 times the shortest distance between boundary curves of the pants .",
    "again , via standard hyperbolic trigonometry , this distance is @xmath83 .",
    "these curves are thus at least of length @xmath84 .",
    "we conclude by observing that although the curve @xmath72 is a systole , it is not straight . indeed , on the pair of pants with @xmath72 and the two cusps",
    ", there is a unique simple geodesic path @xmath73 , perpendicular to @xmath72 in both endpoints .",
    "again , via hyperbolic trigonometry its length is exactly @xmath78 .",
    "it is thus a distance realizing path between the endpoints and is not contained in @xmath72 .",

    "we proceed by contradiction .",

    "one of these arcs , say @xmath52 , has the property of being of length less than @xmath86 this arc @xmath52 can be of two types : either @xmath52 has its endpoints on the two copies of @xmath42 , or it has both endpoints on the same copy .",
    "in the first case , we consider the shortest arc @xmath76 of @xmath42 between the two endpoints of @xmath52 . clearly @xmath87 .",

    "as @xmath101 is maximal , the curve @xmath85 must cross a homological systole @xmath42 , otherwise by the length expansion lemma , one can increase @xmath85 to strictly increase the length of all simple closed geodesics that do not cross @xmath85 , thus including all homological systoles . now @xmath85 is separating and essentially intersects @xmath42 , thus @xmath85 must intersect @xmath42 at least twice which by lemma [ lem : int ] is a contradiction .",
    "one could ask what happens for multiply punctured surfaces .",
    "what fails in the proof is that for @xmath106 , the systole of a surface is no longer necessarily straight .",
    "note that the equality may in fact hold for @xmath107 , only the method given here does nt work .",
    "a general inequality of the form @xmath108 is deemed to fail however , as will be explained in what follows .",

    "one way of making this effective is by examining buser s hairy torus examples ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we recall briefly the construction and features of these surfaces .",
    "one begins by constructing a hyperbolic  square \" ( a right angled quadrilateral with equal length sides ) with a cusp in the middle .",
    "each side of the square can be taken to be of length @xmath78 .",
    "one then constructs an @xmath109 checker board using @xmath110 of these squares .",
    "the board now has its @xmath62 sides of length @xmath111 .",
    "a torus is then obtained by gluing the opposite sides in the obvious way . now if one cuts along a non - homologically trivial curve on this surface",
    ", the genus must be reduced .",
    "such a curve must cross either every horizontal line or every vertical line .",
    "as such , it must have length at least @xmath111 .    to obtain surfaces of genus @xmath4 surfaces which enjoy the same property , one can paste together @xmath4 copies of a hairy torus . to paste two tori together",
    ", one can replace a cusp on each torus by a very short geodesic in the standard way .",
    "the very short geodesic is homologically trivial , and again by the collar lemma , any curve that crosses it must be very long . in particular , a homology systole will not cross this curve and will thus remain in one of the two tori .",
    "one now repeats the construction to obtain a string of hairy tori ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the resulting surface is of signature @xmath112 with homology systole at least @xmath111 .",
    "in contrast , note that for fixed genus , the systole length of a surface is uniformly bounded .",
    "more specifically , schmutz schaller @xcite proved that the systole of a surface of signature @xmath26 is bounded by @xmath113 ( which is uniformly bounded by a constant which depends on @xmath4 ) . for each @xmath4 , we can now compute the minimal @xmath114 for which @xmath115 with @xmath116 . the first @xmath114 for which this occurs is @xmath117 . as a result of this construction , and the monoticity of @xmath39 in @xmath5 , we obtain the following .",
