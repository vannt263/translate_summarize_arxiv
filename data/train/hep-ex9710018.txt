    "high energy collisions between photons and protons can produce jets in the final state . in leading order quantum chromodynamics",

    "the photon participates in the hard scatter via either boson - gluon fusion or qcd compton scattering . in",
    "resolved processes the photon acts as a source of quarks and gluons , and only a fraction of its momentum participates in the hard scatter .",
    "this separation between direct and resolved photoproduction is only well defined in this way at leading order . to make a measurement which can be compared to calculations at any order ,",
    "the variable @xmath72 is used to separate these two types of event  @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath72 is the fraction of the photon s momentum contributing to the production of the two highest transverse energy ( @xmath0 ) jets .",
    "it is defined for the photoproduction of jets in positron - proton scattering as : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the initial positron energy and @xmath75 is the jet pseudorapidityln@xmath76 ) where @xmath77 is the polar angle with respect to the @xmath78 axis , which in the zeus coordinate system is defined to be the proton beam direction . ] .",
    "the inelasticity @xmath79 is defined in the zeus frame as @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the energy and polar angle of the outgoing positron . in a leading order calculation ,",
    "direct processes have @xmath83 since all the photon s momentum participates in the production of the high transverse energy jets , while resolved processes have @xmath84 since part of the photon s momentum goes into the photon remnant . throughout the following , in both the data and the calculations , direct and resolved samples",
    "are defined in terms of a cut on @xmath72 rather than in terms of the lo diagrams . in a recent analysis by the h1 collaboration ,",
    "a similar variable was used to determine an effective parton distribution in the photon  @xcite .    in a previous analysis",
    "@xcite dijet cross sections were measured using 1993 zeus data in the kinematic regime where the difference between the pseudorapidities of the two jets is small ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this condition constrains @xmath86 , the angle between the jet - jet axis and the beam axis in the dijet centre of mass system , to be close to @xmath87 . the cross section as a function of @xmath88 then has maximal sensitivity to the parton distributions in both the photon and proton  @xcite . in @xcite , the comparison between data and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations based on the lo direct and resolved processes showed that the jet profiles , as described by the transverse energy flow around the jet axis , are poorly reproduced for jets with low @xmath0 produced in the forward ( proton ) direction . in the present analysis",
    "a comparison will be made with mc simulations which include multiparton interactions , and an improved description of the data is obtained .    to compare data and theoretical cross sections based on next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations , it is essential that similar jet definitions be employed for both the measurement and calculations .",
    "the dijet cross sections as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath89 , for low and high @xmath72 , are measured in the hadronic final state using various jet definitions , including the @xmath90 algorithm .",
    "the resulting cross sections are compared to nlo qcd calculations at the parton level .",
    "the uncertainties due to hadronization effects are not yet theoretically estimated and are not considered in the comparison . after a brief description of the experimental setup , a discussion of the issues involved in the various jet definitions in both theory and experiment is presented , followed by our results and conclusions .",
    "in 1994 hera provided 27.5  gev positrons and 820  gev protons colliding in 153 bunches .",
    "additional unpaired positron and proton bunches circulated to allow monitoring of the background from beam - gas interactions .",
    "events from empty beam crossings ( that is bunches containing neither positrons nor protons ) were used to estimate the background from cosmic rays .",
    "the total integrated luminosity used in this analysis is @xmath91  pb@xmath92 with an uncertainty of @xmath931.5% .",
    "details of the zeus detector have been described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the primary components used in this analysis are the central tracking system and the calorimeter .",
    "the central tracking system consists of a vertex detector  @xcite and a central tracking detector  @xcite enclosed in a 1.43  t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "the uranium and scintillator calorimeter  @xcite covers 99.7% of the total solid angle and is subdivided into three parts : forward ( fcal ) covering @xmath94 , barrel ( bcal ) covering the central region @xmath95 and rear ( rcal ) covering the backward region @xmath96 , for a collision at the nominal interaction point .",
    "each calorimeter part consists of an electromagnetic section followed by an hadronic section .",
    "the cells of these sections have inner face sizes of @xmath97 @xmath98 ( @xmath99 @xmath98 in the rear calorimeter ) and @xmath100 @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "a lead and scintillator calorimeter is used to measure the luminosity via the the detection of photons from the positron - proton bremsstrahlung process .",
    "this calorimeter is installed 107  m along the hera tunnel from the interaction point in the positron direction and subtends a small angle at the interaction vertex  @xcite .",
    "a fraction of the positrons scattered through small angles are detected in a similar lead and scintillator calorimeter positioned at @xmath101  m.",
    "most of the previous measurements of jet cross sections at hadron - hadron colliders and in photoproduction at hera have used some variation of a cone - based jet algorithm . in these algorithms , according to the standardisation of cone jet algorithms at the snowmass meeting in 1990 @xcite , jets consist of calorimeter cells ( or , in a theoretical description , partons ) @xmath102 with a distance @xmath103 from the jet centre . here",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath105 are the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity of the cell ( or parton ) , and @xmath106 is the jet cone radius . in this analysis ,",
    "the geometric centre of the cell is used to define the position .",
    "the parameters for the jet are calculated as : @xmath107 in which the sums run over all calorimeter cells ( or partons ) belonging to the jet .",
    "different approaches are possible to the choice of the ` seed ' with which to begin jet finding , and to how and when overlapping jets are merged .",
    "the approach is not fixed by the snowmass convention .",
    "we use two different cone algorithms to determine dijet cross sections in photoproduction .",
    "the jet cone radius @xmath108 is chosen for both algorithms .",
    "we also use a cluster algorithm , which does not suffer from these ambiguities .",
    "a further advantage of the cluster algorithm is that it is infrared safe to all orders , which is not always the case for cone algorithms  @xcite . in the following",
    "the three algorithms will be described in detail considering as an example the case of calorimeter cells .",
    "identical algorithms are used in this analysis to define jets in the hadronic final state starting from the final state particles .    in the first cone algorithm ( eucell ) a window in the @xmath109 space of the calorimeter cells is moved around to find those positions where the @xmath110 in the window is @xmath111  gev to use as seeds .",
    "the jet quantities are initially calculated using the cells in a cone centred on the seed . equations ( [ snow - eqn ] ) and  ( [ jetpar_eqn ] ) are then applied to choose the cells belonging to the jets and to update the jet quantities in an iterative procedure until a stable jet is found .",
    "only the highest transverse energy jet is accepted , the cells within the jet are removed , and the whole process is repeated . in this way eucell produces no overlapping jets .    the second cone algorithm ( pucell )",
    "was adapted from the algorithm used by cdf  @xcite and determines seeds by finding the single calorimeter cell of highest transverse energy and placing a cone around it .",
    "all the cells within the selected cone are assigned to this seed and excluded from the search for further seeds , which is then continued .",
    "the jet quantities are initially calculated using the cells in the seed and equations ( [ snow - eqn ] ) and  ( [ jetpar_eqn ] ) are then applied iteratively as for eucell until a stable jet is found . at this stage",
    "all jets are provisionally accepted .",
    "thus it may happen that two stable jets overlap .",
    "if the overlapping transverse energy amounts to more than 75% of the smallest jet , they are merged , otherwise the overlapping energy is split such that cells are associated with the closest jet .    in the cluster algorithm ktclus",
    "@xcite the quantity @xmath112 is calculated for each pair of objects ( where the initial objects are the calorimeter cells ) , and for each individual object : @xmath113 if , of all the numbers [ @xmath114 , @xmath115 is the smallest then objects @xmath116 and @xmath117 are combined into a single new object . if however @xmath118 is the smallest , then object @xmath116 is a jet and is removed from the sample .",
    "this is repeated until all objects are assigned to jets .",
    "as with the cone algorithms , eq .",
    "( [ jetpar_eqn ] ) is used to determine the parameters of the jets .",
    "it is also used to determine the parameters of the intermediate objects .",
    "equations  ( [ snow - eqn ] ) and  ( [ jetpar_eqn ] ) imply that in a nlo calculation , two partons must be a distance @xmath119 from each other to be combined , where @xmath120 is the transverse energy of parton @xmath116 .",
    "this implies that if two partons have approximately equal transverse energy they may be separated from each other by as much as @xmath121 and still satisfy eq.([snow - eqn ] ) .",
    "however , as parton @xmath122 does not then lie inside a cone of radius @xmath106 around parton @xmath102 and vice versa , one might with some justification also count the two partons separately .",
    "if one wishes to compare theory with measurement it is necessary to match the theoretical treatment of such cases to the operation of the jet finding and jet merging criteria used experimentally .",
    "this is done by introducing an additional parameter , @xmath123 , to the theory to restrict the maximum separation between two partons in a single jet @xcite .",
    "( [ snow - parton - eqn ] ) then becomes @xmath124.\\ ] ] the valid range of @xmath123 is between @xmath125 and @xmath121 .",
    "for a nlo three parton final state , it is found that @xmath126 corresponds to eucell , @xmath127 to pucell , and @xmath128 to ktclus  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "all three jet definitions will be used for a comparison of the resulting dijet cross sections .",
    "an alternative approach would be to treat @xmath129 as a parameter , and tune it in order to take into account possible theoretical uncertainties such as higher order contributions .",
    "however , in the present analysis this approach has not been followed and @xmath129 is fixed by the functionality of each jet algorithm .",
    "the zeus detector uses a three - level trigger system .",
    "the first level selects events used in this analysis with a coincidence of a regional or transverse energy sum in the calorimeter , and at least one track from the interaction point measured in the central tracking chamber . at the second level , at least 8  gev total transverse energy , excluding the eight calorimeter towers immediately surrounding the forward beampipe , is required , and cuts on calorimeter energies and timing are used to suppress events caused by interactions between the proton beam and residual gas in the beam pipe  @xcite . at the third level",
    ", a cone algorithm uses the calorimeter cell energies and positions to identify jets .",
    "events are required to have at least two jets , each of which has @xmath130  gev and @xmath131 or @xmath132  gev and @xmath133 .",
    "additional tracking cuts were made to reject proton beam - gas interactions and cosmic ray events .",
    "further cuts are applied offline .",
    "charged current deep inelastic scattering events are rejected by a cut on the missing transverse momentum measured in the calorimeter . to reject remaining beam - gas and cosmic ray background events , tighter cuts using the final @xmath134vertex position , other tracking information and timing information",
    "are applied .",
    "two additional cuts are made  @xcite , based upon two different measurements of @xmath79 :    1 .",
    "events with a positron candidate in the uranium calorimeter are removed if @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the value of @xmath79 as measured assuming the positron candidate is the scattered positron .",
    "a cut is made on the jacquet - blondel measurement of @xmath79  @xcite , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 , and @xmath139 is the energy deposited in the calorimeter cell @xmath102 which has a polar angle @xmath140 with respect to the measured @xmath78-vertex of the event .",
    "the sum runs over all calorimeter cells . for any event where the scattered positron entered the uranium calorimeter and either is not identified or gives @xmath136 above @xmath141",
    ", the value of @xmath142 will be near to one .",
    "proton beam - gas events will have low values of @xmath142 . to further reduce the contamination from both these sources",
    ", it is required that @xmath143 .",
    "this range corresponds approximately to the true @xmath79 range of @xmath144 .",
    "these cuts restrict the range of the photon virtuality to less than @xmath145  gev@xmath146 , with a median of around @xmath147  gev@xmath148 , which excludes deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) events .    to select dijet candidates with a particular jet algorithm ,",
    "the algorithm is applied to the calorimeter cells . in each case , the jet transverse energy measured in the zeus detector is corrected as a function of @xmath149 and @xmath150 . the variable @xmath150 is used to denote the transverse energy of a jet before correction for the effects of inactive material .",
    "this correction is derived from the mc events described in the next section by comparing the true transverse energy of the jet , found by applying the algorithm to the final state particles , to the ( lower ) transverse energy measured in the calorimeter simulation , obtaining the average shift between the two transverse energies for each jet algorithm .",
    "the average shift in jet energies is around @xmath151 for all three jet algorithms , and varies between @xmath152 and @xmath153 depending upon @xmath154 .",
    "the largest shifts occur at the boundaries between the fcal and bcal and between the bcal and rcal .",
    "no correction was applied to @xmath149 since , from mc , the average shift in @xmath155 between the particle and detector jets is less than @xmath930.05 for all @xmath155 values in the range used for the cross section measurements .",
    "the description of the calorimeter response to particles and jets in the mc has been tuned using several methods  @xcite , including ( i ) the comparison of charged track momenta with calorimeter energy measurements , ( ii ) comparison of jet and positron variables in dis events and ( iii ) the comparison of the measurement of the incident photon energy deduced from the energy of the positron measured in the small - angle positron calorimeter , to that calculated from energy deposits in the uranium calorimeter .",
    "the fivefold increase in statistics in 1994 allowed the calorimeter energy scale to be studied in more detail than before , and these studies revealed a @xmath156 difference between data and mc .",
    "this difference was removed in the present analysis ( in the 1993 analysis  @xcite , this difference was not corrected , but the possibility of such a discrepancy was allowed for in the systematic errors ) .",
    "studies using jet photoproduction events allow us to assign an uncertainty of 5% to the calorimeter response for the jets used in this analysis  @xcite .",
    "other studies have shown that of this 5% uncertainty , 3% arises from the absolute energy scale of the calorimeter  @xcite .    after the jet energy correction , events are required to have at least two jets with @xmath157  gev , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "the mc gives a good description of the @xmath160 distribution around this region . for events with three or more jets ,",
    "the two highest @xmath0 jets are used to calculate all jet - related event properties .",
    "this procedure is also employed later in all the theoretical and mc predictions shown .",
    "after these cuts about 25000 events remain , of which about 20% have @xmath161 ( the exact number depending upon the jet algorithm ) .",
    "events with a third jet which passes the @xmath0 and @xmath75 cuts comprise about 8% of the final sample .",
    "of all events , 22% have their scattered positrons detected in the small - angle tagger , which is the fraction expected for a sample of photoproduction events  @xcite .",
    "no event from unpaired @xmath162 or @xmath163 bunches survives the selection cuts , implying that the non-@xmath164 background is negligible .",
    "the contamination from events with photon virtualities greater than 4  gev@xmath148 is estimated using simulated dis events .",
    "this contribution is much smaller than the statistical errors and is therefore not subtracted from the data .",
    "in fig .  [ f : fig1 ] the @xmath72 distribution of the zeus data selected using the ktclus algorithm with ( corrected ) @xmath1 gev , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 is shown ( black dots ) .",
    "this @xmath72 is determined by using the corrected jet energies and corrected @xmath142 .",
    "the correction to @xmath142 is determined using mc generated events , by comparing @xmath142 to the true @xmath79 , as a function of the @xmath72 calculated using uncorrected variables .",
    "the peak at high @xmath72 due to direct photon processes and the rise at low @xmath72 due to resolved photon processes are both clearly visible .",
    "the sharp fall off for @xmath165 is a result of the @xmath0 and @xmath75 kinematic cuts .",
    "the data are compared to the results of two lo qcd - based mc simulation programs , herwig58  @xcite ( solid line ) and pythia57  @xcite ( dashed line ) .",
    "all the mc events have been passed through a detailed simulation of the zeus detector and through the same jet energy correction procedure as was applied to the data .",
    "the grv  @xcite parton distributions are used for the photon and the mrsa  @xcite parton distributions are used for the proton .",
    "the simulation programs are based on lo qcd calculations for the hard scatter and include parton showering and hadronisation effects . the minimum transverse momentum of the partonic hard scatter ( @xmath166 ) is set to 2.5  gev in both herwig and pythia . for both programs",
    "the direct and resolved photon processes are generated separately .    in the case of the resolved processes multiparton interactions ( mi )",
    "are included  @xcite as an attempt to simulate the energy from additional softer scatters ( ` underlying event ' ) , in both the dashed pythia curve and the solid herwig curve .",
    "this has been shown to improve the simulation of the energy flow around the jet axis  @xcite .    in order to obtain the best agreement with the data the normalisations of the two processes were determined by allowing them to vary independently and fitting to the uncorrected @xmath72 distribution . as a result ,",
    "the cross section from herwig for resolved processes was scaled by 1.2 with respect to the direct .",
    "the ratio of direct and resolved contributions using this scaled cross section was then 0.12 , to be compared with 0.15 when using the unscaled cross sections within herwig . for pythia the equivalent scale factor for the resolved cross section , and the ratio of direct and resolved , were found to be the same as for herwig within the precision quoted here .",
    "the dotted line shows the distribution for herwig without mi . for the mi ,",
    "models based upon the independent statistical replication of scatters ( eikonal models ) are used which allow the generation of additional independent partonic scatters ( with transverse momenta above for herwig and 1.4 gev for pythia ) in resolved photon events . for herwig",
    "the average number of scatters for events generated with these parameters is 1.05 and for pythia it is 1.66 .",
    "one effect of mi is to increase the number of events at low @xmath72 .",
    "however , even after the inclusion of mi with these parameters , the data still lie above the simulation    the uncorrected transverse energy flow around the jets is shown in fig .  [ f : fig2 ] , for events in various bins of @xmath150 and @xmath149 for ktclus jets , and is compared to the distributions from the herwig mc both with and without mi after full simulation of the detector .",
    "the jet profiles are described reasonably well by the mc with mi for most of the kinematic range , although there is still a tendency for mc jets to have too much energy inside the central region and too little energy outside this region , particularly for low @xmath110 jets in the forward region .",
    "this tendency is significantly stronger for mc samples which do not include multiparton interactions .",
    "however , we do not rule out the possibility that other models for the underlying event , or different mi parameters not investigated here , may provide a similar or better description of the data .",
    "the resolution of the kinematic variables has been studied by comparing , in the mc simulation , jets reconstructed from final state particles ( hadron jets ) with jets reconstructed from the energies measured in the calorimeter ( detector jets ) , and by comparing @xmath142 with the true @xmath79 .",
    "the distribution of the difference in @xmath89 between the hadron and detector jets has a mean of zero , a width of 0.15 units and depends weakly on @xmath89 , exhibiting shifts of about 0.05 units close to the boundaries between the bcal and the fcal or rcal .",
    "the resolution in @xmath72 is 8% at @xmath167 . for @xmath0 and @xmath79 ,",
    "the resolutions are 15% and 0.09 units , respectively .",
    "the jet cross sections presented in this analysis refer to jets in the hadronic final state .",
    "the mc samples have been used to correct the data for the inefficiencies of the trigger and selection cuts and for migrations caused by detector effects .",
    "the correction factors are calculated as the ratio @xmath168 in each bin .",
    "@xmath169 is the number of events generated in the bin and @xmath170 is the number of events reconstructed in the bin after detector smearing and all experimental cuts .",
    "the final bin - by - bin correction factors are between 0.5 and 1.5 for all the cross sections measured .",
    "the dominant effect arises from migrations over the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the sensitivity of the measured cross sections to the selection cuts has been investigated by varying the cuts on the reconstructed variables in the data and herwig mc samples and re - evaluating the cross sections  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cross sections were re - evaluated using a ratio of the direct and resolved contributions derived from the cross sections from herwig without additional scaling ( direct / resolved=0.15 ) , and by using the pythia sample .",
    "they were also evaluated using the herwig model with and without multiparton interactions .",
    "these effects are included as systematic errors on the cross sections , and are correlated to some extent .",
    "the possibility that the detector simulation may incorrectly simulate the detector energy response by up to @xmath171% has also been considered , as mentioned in section  [ sec - ev - sel ] .",
    "this effect is added in quadrature to the overall normalisation error of @xmath172 arising from the uncertainty in the measurement of the integrated luminosity .",
    "this principal correlated uncertainty is indicated in the figures as a shaded band and should be added to the other systematic errors to give the overall uncertainty .",
    "the measured cross sections are now discussed and compared to theoretical expectations .",
    "the cross section is first measured over the whole @xmath72 region and its shape is compared to that of mc expectations .",
    "this cross section includes @xmath72 values down to 0.05 , the lowest value allowed by the other kinematic cuts . at the lower values of @xmath72 , the jet profiles and fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] indicate discrepancies between the data and the mc simulations .",
    "nevertheless , this cross section remains interesting as its shape is less biased by kinematic cuts than those of the cross sections to be discussed in section  7.2 .",
    "we compare the shape to mc simulations which include models for mi , parton showering and hadronisation , but have large scale dependences due to the fact that they include only lo matrix elements .",
    "next , @xmath72 cuts are applied to select regions where contributions arising from an underlying event - which may be responsible for the low-@xmath72 discrepancy in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] - are reduced and hence nlo qcd can be expected to provide a better description of the jet production process . the cross sections measured here in the hadronic final state",
    "are compared to nlo qcd calculations of partonic cross sections .",
    "these calculations have a reduced scale dependence but do not include parton showering beyond a single branching .",
    "mi and hadronization effects are also not included since no theoretical estimation of these two contributions is yet available for these calculations .",
    "this uncertainty is not considered in the following comparisons .",
    "the cross section @xmath174 for @xmath175 dijets @xmath176 in the range @xmath159 , @xmath177 and for virtualities of the exchanged photon less than @xmath178  gev@xmath148 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] and given in table  [ xs_kt_al_tab ] for the ktclus algorithm , requiring @xmath1  gev .",
    "the cross section rises from around 0.2  nb per unit of pseudorapidity at @xmath179 to around 3  nb per unit of pseudorapidity for @xmath180 .",
    "the data may be compared with the predictions of the herwig mc using the direct / resolved ratio of 0.15 given by herwig . while the simulation can describe the shape of the cross section , these predictions fail to describe the overall normalisation , requiring an ad hoc multiplicative scale factor of about 1.8 to agree with the data .",
    "such a factor is not unreasonable given the scale dependence of the mc .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] shows various predictions of the herwig mc after including the factor of 1.8 . with the value of @xmath181  gev used here ,",
    "the data slightly favour the grv parton distribution  @xcite with mi .",
    "the lac1  @xcite or the grv distribution without mi also gives reasonable description of the data .",
    "however the lac1 distribution with mi is ruled out .    the effect of mi in the simulations is a strong function of the choice of the photon parton distributions , in particular the gluon component , which is where the major difference between lac1 and grv lies .",
    "additionally , it should be noted that the effect of mi is also a strong function of the choice of @xmath166  @xcite . no comparison is presented here with nlo perturbative qcd calculations since they do not include mi .",
    "these comparisons are performed in the next subsection , after applying @xmath72 cuts to reduce such effects .",

    "@xmath161 : direct photoproduction .",
    "@xmath182 : resolved photoproduction excluding the low-@xmath72 region .    for each @xmath72 region , the cross sections @xmath174 for @xmath183 dijets @xmath184 in the range @xmath159 , @xmath185 and for virtualities of the exchanged photon @xmath186  gev@xmath148 are measured for four different values of the @xmath0 threshold , @xmath187 = 6 , 8 , 11 and 15  gev .",
    "the cross sections are measured for the three different jet algorithms discussed in section  3 .",

    "since the jets may be accompanied by other soft gluons ( outside the jets ) , there is a potential problem when the two jets have the same @xmath0 . the infrared singularity associated with summing the soft gluon contributions",
    "is usually cancelled by the singularity coming from the one - loop contribution . for two jets with the same @xmath0 ,",
    "some of the phase space for the soft gluon terms is restricted and an incomplete cancellation may occur in some calculations . as a consequence , klasen and kramer  @xcite have allowed the second jet to have an @xmath0 less than @xmath187 if the third ( unobserved gluon ) jet has a transverse energy of less than 1  gev . however , the cross section is then sensitive to changes in the value used for this cut on the third jet .",
    "harris and owens  @xcite have applied a low cutoff on the energy of the very soft gluons and found that the dependence of the cross sections on the value of the low energy cutoff used is much less than the quoted errors on the data .",

    "the photoproduction cross section for @xmath161 and @xmath190  gev ( fig .",

    "this decrease arises from the cutoff on the minimum @xmath0 and the cuts on @xmath79 .",
    "the eucell jet cross sections are systematically higher than the pucell cross sections , which in turn are slightly above the ktclus cross sections .",
