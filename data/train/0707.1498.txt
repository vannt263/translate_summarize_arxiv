    "the study of the properties of self - organized systems has increased dramatically in recent years .",
    "this interest originates from the possibility to control the formation of patterns having an important impact on applications that use large - scale self - assembly to create specific pattern morphologies .",
    "this kind of structures occur in systems from diverse areas including chemistry @xcite and biology @xcite . in physics",
    ", it was predicted that systems which fall into this morphological category are generated by the competition between short - range attraction and long - range repulsion @xcite .",
    "this competitive interaction appears in many systems , such as magnetic materials @xcite , colloids @xcite , and two - dimensional electron systems @xcite .",
    "experimentally , colloidal systems are one of the most studied systems , which in combination with theoretical predictions , may lead to the design of novel soft materials and to an understanding of the glass and gel state of matter @xcite .",
    "recently , it was observed that a similar type of pattern formation can also arise in particular classes of ultrasoft colloids with a strictly repulsive inter - particle potential @xcite .    besides presenting a rich variety of cluster types and showing an excellent model for technological applications , colloidal systems have the added advantage of the facility to control the interaction between particles and of real time imaging of their configuration through video microscopy .",
    "a wide variety of studies of colloidal systems were performed in order to understand the structure and dynamics of different kind of systems , such as colloidal particles interacting through a short - range attractive and long - range repulsive potential @xcite .",
    "for instance , a binary system of superparamagnetic colloidal particles that are confined by a two - dimensional ( 2d ) water - air interface and exposed to an external magnetic field perpendicular to the interface showed diverse stable configurations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the authors observed that clustering appeared only for one type of particles , instead of both types of particles .",
    "recently , several models were developed having a small number of interacting particles in order to understand the behavior of colloidal systems as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "different melting scenarios were studied extensively in systems consisting of charged particles for a range of different inter - particle interaction and trap types , such as a system of binary charged particles confined by a circular hard - wall potential interacting by a repulsive dipole potential @xcite , confined by a parabolic trap potential and interacting by a coulomb inter - particle potential @xcite , and non - confined particles with short - range attraction and long - range repulsion interaction @xcite .",
    "motivated by the increased interest in the behavior of systems of particles that are characterized by a competition between short - range attraction and long - range repulsion , we analyze here the melting of a system composed of a finite number of classical particles interacting through a potential which is composed of a repulsive coulomb and an attractive exponential term .",
    "the particles move in a 2d plane that are confined by a parabolic trap .",
    "the zero temperature configurations of this system were studied by nelissen _",
    "they observed several kinds of topological different configurations ( e.g. , ring and bubble configuration ) . but from this rise the question about the stability of those kinds of configuration against thermal fluctuation .",
    "this motivated us to study the melting of these ordered configurations and to analyze the effect of the interplay between the short - range and the long range interaction on the melting process .",
    "we found , that if one increases the temperature , some of the bubble configurations exhibit a thermally induced structural phase transition and a remarkable re - entrant behavior .",
    "in addition , we found that this system exhibits hysteresis behavior for the mean radial displacement when we increase and decrease the temperature and the configuration goes through a thermally induced structural phase transition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the mathematical model and the numerical approach to obtain the ground state configurations . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the melting process for different inter - particle potentials .",
    "temperature induced re - entrant and hysteresis effects are discussed in sec .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec . v.",
    "we consider a 2d cluster with @xmath3 classical particles interacting through a potential composed of a repulsive coulomb and an attractive exponential term as in ref .",
    "the particles are kept together by a parabolic potential centered at the origin .",
    "the general dimensionless hamiltonian of the system is written as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the distance of the @xmath6th particles from the center of the parabolic confinement .",
    "the energy and the distance are in units of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "notice that the @xmath1 and @xmath0 parameters determine the exponential contribution in the hamiltonian , where @xmath1 determines the strength and @xmath9 the interaction range of the attractive part of the inter - particle potential ( the third term in eq . ( [ hamiltonianii ] ) ) .",
    "note also that the @xmath0 parameter is inversely proportional to the range of the attractive part in the potential .",
    "now the state of the system is determined by @xmath1 , @xmath0 and the number of particles @xmath3 .",
    "temperature is expressed in units of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the ground state configurations ( @xmath12 ) of the two - dimensional system were obtained by the monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation method ( using the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite ) extended with the newton optimization method @xcite . the particles were allowed to reach a steady state configuration after @xmath13 simulation steps , starting from different initial random positions . in the same time , we calculate the frequencies of the normal modes of the system using the householder diagonalization technique @xcite .",
    "the configuration was taken as final if all frequencies of the normal modes were positive and the energy did not decrease further .    in order to understand the trajectory of each particle correctly , we study the melting of the system using molecular dynamic simulation ( md ) . the temperature of system was increased from @xmath12 ( ground state configuration ) with successive steps of @xmath14 and equilibrating at the new temperature during @xmath15 md steps , ( with a typical step size of @xmath16 ) .",
    "after this equilibrium , the average energy was calculated , together with the mean squared radial displacement given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average inter - particle distance at zero temperature . the symbol @xmath19 stands for an average over typically @xmath20 - @xmath21 md steps after equilibration of the system .",
    "the melting temperature was determined through a lindemann - like criterion , which has been widely used for 2d finite size clusters .",
    "this criterion states that melting occurs when @xmath22 reaches 0.1 of the inter - particle distance at zero temperature @xcite . but",
    "what is essential is that melting is characterized by a rapid increase of the fluctuation of particles when temperature reaches the melting temperature .",
    "in the following , we analyze the melting temperature and as an example we consider systems composed of @xmath23 and @xmath24 particles and study its dependence on the @xmath1 and @xmath0 parameters .",
    "these two systems are the typical examples of the @xmath12 configurations consisting of rings or bubbles .      in this section",
    ", we study the melting temperature , as a function of the strength of the attractive part of the inter - particle interaction ( @xmath1 ) , for @xmath25 and @xmath26 particles and a fixed value of @xmath0 .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_varb ] that different @xmath1-regions exhibit a different melting temperature ( @xmath27 ) dependence .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath25 and @xmath28 , we find that the melting temperature decreases when @xmath1 increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_varb](a ) ) , whereas the opposite behavior is found for large @xmath1 values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_varb](b ) ) . the behavior of fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_varb](a ) is in some sense a surprising result since @xmath1 is the strength of the short - range attraction , and one may expect that the larger the attraction strength , the more packed the particles are , and therefore the higher the melting temperature .",
    "this concept is correct since the attractive part of the potential is large enough to compete with the repulsive potential part , but on the contrary , the opposite effect happens because the total inter - particle potential is purely repulsive in the case of the cluster of fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_varb](a ) .",
    "in this situation , when the value of @xmath1 increases , the repulsive potential decreases [ see eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonianii ] ) ] in the same way as the melting temperature due to the decrease of the coupling among the particles .",
    "this behavior was also observed for the system with @xmath24 particles and @xmath29 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_varb](c ) ] .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_varb](b ) and [ fig : tmelt_varb](d ) , we show the dependence of the melting temperature as a function of @xmath1 for the cluster with @xmath25 , @xmath28 and @xmath26 , @xmath29 , respectively in the large b - region .",
    "as seen , the attractive part of the potential is large enough to form small clusters , and therefore the melting temperature increases with @xmath1 as a consequence of the increase of the attractive part of the inter - particle potential .",
    "hence when the system is composed of bubbles , the melting temperature increases with @xmath1 due to the increase of the coupling among particles in the small bubbles . the behavior of figs .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_varb](a ) , [ fig : tmelt_varb](c ) and figs .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_varb](b ) , [ fig : tmelt_varb](d ) clearly shows the dependence of the melting temperature on @xmath1 , which is opposite for pure ring configurations and bubble configurations .          in this section",
    ", we present the melting temperature as a function of @xmath0 , the range of the attractive part of the inter - particle potential , for @xmath25 and @xmath26 particles and a fixed value of @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to remember that the @xmath0-parameter is inversely proportional to the range of the attractive part of the inter - particle potential . although the attractive range presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_vark](a ) is too small to agglomerate particles , it is significant to change the melting temperature for small @xmath0-values . in other words ,",
    "when the value of @xmath0 is increased from @xmath30 to higher values , the attraction between the particles decreases and consequently the coulomb repulsion increases .",
    "consequently , the particles become more packed and the melting temperature increases . for large @xmath0-values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_vark](a ) , the attraction range is too small either to form small clusters or to influence the melting temperature .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that the coupling among particles saturates for large @xmath0-values , that is , the particles can not be more densely packed and therefore the value of the melting temperature becomes almost constant .",
    "for the situation when bubbles are present ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_vark](b ) ) , we find that the melting temperature also increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this general behavior is due to a decrease of the attractive part of the inter - particle potential when @xmath0 increases .",
    "moreover , we observe that for small @xmath0-values shown in fig . [",
    "fig : tmelt_vark](b ) , the range of the attraction is large enough to form bubbles but does not influence the melting temperature considerably .",
    "in other words , the particles are weakly coupled in small bubbles for small values of @xmath0 and the small difference of @xmath0 does not change strongly the coupling among particles and therefore the melting temperature . on the another hand , for large @xmath0-values in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_vark](b ) , the different attraction range changes the melting temperature due to the increase of the coupling among the particles . in this situation ,",
    "a small difference of @xmath0 increases the packing among particles and therefore changes the melting temperature .",
    "a similar trend in the melting temperature is found for other clusters with @xmath24 particles [ figs .",
    "[ fig : tmelt_vark](c ) and [ fig : tmelt_vark](d ) respectively ] .",
    "we can see that the behavior of the melting temperature is in general the same for the different configurations , i.e. , the higher the value of @xmath0 , the higher the coupling among particles and consequently the higher the melting temperature .",
    "however , the melting temperature has different regimes as a function of @xmath0 for the same configuration .    in this section ,",
    "we observed clearly the different dependence of the melting temperature with respect to the strength and the range of the attractive inter - particle potential . for different strength of the attractive potential ,",
    "the behavior of the melting temperature is determined by the configuration of the system , i.e. , pure ring configurations or bubble configurations .",
    "on the another hand , the range of the attractive potential is important to determine the trend of the melting temperature for a specific configuration .",
    "the bubble configurations presented in this section did not exhibit a structural transition from bubble to ring configuration when the temperature is increased .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the melting temperature of the ring configurations are smaller than that of the bubble configurations , i.e. , the bubble configurations are more stable than the ring configurations for the strength and the range of the attractive potential presented in figs .

    "]    recently , colloidal systems exhibited several new and interesting features , such as re - entrant behavior @xcite and a hysteresis effect @xcite . in this section , we show for a specific short - range interaction that our system can present a different re - entrant effect and a hysteresis behavior as a function of temperature .",

    "[ fig : urr2_b7_k4](a ) for a system with @xmath31 and @xmath29 .",

    "this re - entrant behavior was observed both in experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite which , in the present case , is due to an increase of the stability of the whole system caused by an increase of the symmetry of the system configuration . in other words , the value of the mean radial displacement decreases after @xmath34 as a result of the change in the configuration of the system .    in order to confirm that the re - entrant behavior is caused by the change in the configuration , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : urr2_b7_k4](b ) the position of the particles with respect to the center of the confinement potential as a function of temperature .",
    "specifically , in each md step we organize the distance of each particle in such a way that @xmath36 correspond to the first , second , third , ... , @xmath3th closest particles from the center of the cluster , respectively .",

    "as can be seen , the system remains in the bubble configuration from @xmath12 to @xmath34 .",
    "we will label this configuration as ( @xmath39 ) which means that there is one ring of @xmath40 particles and @xmath41 bubbles of @xmath42 particles [ see the left inset of fig .",

    "[ fig : urr2_b7_k4](a ) and [ fig : urr2_b7_k4](b ) that the value of the mean radial displacement decreases when the configuration changes from ( @xmath39 ) to ( @xmath43 ) and increases rapidly when the temperature approaches the melting temperature of the ring configuration .",
    "therefore , this change of configuration is a structural transition which stabilizes the system .",
    "this transition occurs before the system is completely melted and is a thermally induced structural phase transition .",
    "this interesting phenomenon was found in diverse previous studies @xcite but , in this case , it is the result of the increase of disorder in small bubbles when the temperature approaches @xmath34 .    in order to better understand the local disorder of the particles , we present in figs .",

    "<S> a self - organized system composed of classical particles confined in a two - dimensional parabolic trap and interacting through a potential with a short - range attractive part and long - range repulsive part is studied as function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the competition between the short - range attractive part of the inter - particle potential and its long - range repulsive part on the melting temperature is studied . </S>",
    "<S> different behaviors of the melting temperature are found depending on the screening length ( @xmath0 ) and the strength ( @xmath1 ) of the attractive part of the inter - particle potential . a re - entrant behavior and a thermal induced phase transition </S>",
    "<S> is observed in a small region of ( @xmath2)-space . a structural hysteresis effect is observed as a function of temperature and physically understood as due to the presence of a potential barrier between different configurations of the system . </S>"
