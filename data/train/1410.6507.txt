    "the potts model @xcite is a cornerstone of classical statistical physics . first appearing in potts ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite as a generalization of the ising model , it is a simple but highly nontrivial model . indeed , the family of @xmath0-state antiferromagnetic ( af ) potts models displays a rich and complex range of behavior , providing many examples of different phase transitions , critical phenomena , ordered states , and universality classes .",
    "although the @xmath2 potts model is equivalent to the ising model , and thus has exact solutions for all planar lattices with nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite , including the square @xcite , triangular @xcite , and honeycomb @xcite geometries , exact results for @xmath3 are rare .",
    "many other problems in statistical mechanics are closely related to the potts model , including vertex models @xcite , bond and vertex coloring problems @xcite , and loop models @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the af potts model is dictated by the interplay between @xmath0 , the number of states per site , and the lattice geometry .",
    "when @xmath0 is small compared to the average coordination number @xmath4 of the lattice , at low temperatures the limited number of degrees of freedom will in general be fixed , and ordered , by geometrical and interaction requirements .",
    "however , when @xmath0 is similar to or greater than @xmath4 , the entropy is such that the system may not order at any temperature @xcite .",
    "in addition to the conventional zero - temperature limits of complete order or disorder , af potts models show two further possibilities .",
    "one is that the ground state is genuinely critical , the result of an arrested `` zero - temperature phase transition '' to an ordered state ; this type of physics is known in the @xmath5 af potts model on the square @xcite and kagome @xcite lattices and in the @xmath6 af potts model on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "the other is that some , but not all , of the degrees of freedom of the system may form a state of partial long - range order @xcite ; partial or complete ordering processes occur at different types of `` finite - temperature phase transition . ''    at a conventional phase transition , the order parameter becomes finite everywhere in the system to minimize the free energy , and the result is a state of complete order at zero temperature . in the example of the ferromagnetic ising model",
    ", all spins are oriented either upwards or downwards in the ground state . however , in systems with sufficiently many degrees of freedom ( sufficiently large entropy , as in a potts model with sufficiently high @xmath0 ) , the crossover to a ground state optimizing the resulting entropic contribution may occur in a step - wise fashion .",
    "the minimization of energy may be achieved in many different ways , and may involve only some of the lattice sites .",
    "the remaining degeneracy , and the type of order , is then determined by the maximization of entropy .",
    "the result is an `` entropy - driven '' transition , usually occurring at a finite temperature , and to a state of partial order .",
    "on cooling to zero temperature , if the system retains a nonzero `` residual '' entropy then a ground state with order on only a subset of the lattice sites can be achieved .",
    "the best - known example of the physics of extensive ground - state degeneracy is found in ice @xcite .",
    "the majority of prior work on partial order has concerned frustrated systems , where the energy can not be minimized locally , meaning for all bonds simultaneously @xcite . the af ising model on the triangular lattice @xcite is an archetypal frustrated system , because no spin configuration can minimize all three bonds on a triangle simultaneously .",
    "frustrated systems share the same property of highly degenerate ground states , arising from their frustrated interactions , and the formation of partially ordered states offers one avenue for partial frustration relief and partial entropy reduction .",
    "when partial order arises in unfrustrated systems @xcite , its origin lies only in configurational entropy effects . in 2008 ,",
    "kotecky and coauthors @xcite found partial long - range order in the @xmath5 af potts model on the diced lattice , performing both analytical and numerical studies of the accompanying finite - temperature phase transition . in 2011 , we @xcite traced their result to the extensive zero - temperature entropy ( residual entropy per site ) of this lattice , which arises because it is `` irregular '' in the sense of having differently coordinated sites ( we defer a discussion of lattice types to sec .",
    "ii ) . from this insight we demonstrated the existence of finite - temperature phase transitions and partial order in the @xmath6 potts models on the union - jack and centered diced lattices .",
    "partial order is the result of a partial symmetry - breaking , and we found that , depending on the potts model in question , the singularity associated with this breaking of symmetry may be either almost as strong as a full symmetry - breaking , or may be remarkably weak and difficult to detect .",
    "partial order in the ground state is known exactly in a number of models . in the spin-@xmath7",
    "af ising model on the triangular lattice , for sufficiently large @xmath7 the ground state is partially ordered on two of the hexagonal sublattices but disordered on the third @xcite . also in two dimensions , the ground states of the af ising model on the union - jack lattice @xcite , kagome lattice @xcite , dilute centered square lattice @xcite , anisotropic triangular lattice @xcite , and villain lattice ( anisotropic square lattice ) @xcite are all partially ordered .",
    "partial order also exists for some frustrated systems , such as the @xmath5 potts model on the villain lattice @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional classical models with partial order are mostly frustrated , including the ising model on the accumulated triangular @xcite and body - centered cubic ( bcc ) @xcite lattices , the classical heisenberg model on the bcc lattice @xcite , models on the simple cubic lattice @xcite , the @xmath6 af potts model on the diamond lattice @xcite and the xy model on the checkerboard lattice @xcite .",
    "experimentally , partial order has been observed in the frustrated af material gd@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "partial order is also predicted for the periodic anderson model on the triangular lattice @xcite and the heisenberg model on the bcc lattice @xcite .",
    "although the potts model is one of the simplest in statistical physics , its analytical study has been restricted by the limited number of exactly known results beyond @xmath2 .",
    "methods including height mapping @xcite have some general utility , while mappings to related coloring problems @xcite are useful in specific cases .",
    "previous numerical studies of potts models have made use of monte carlo @xcite and transfer - matrix @xcite techniques .",
    "monte carlo simulations are accurate , and can study large but finite lattice sizes , while transfer - matrix methods are infinite in one spatial dimension but finite in the other(s ) , and can be used to study fractional values of @xmath0 .    in this paper we introduce ( sec .",
    "iii ) a set of tensor - based numerical methods , which are quite generally applicable in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the partition function is written as the trace over a network of tensors representing the states of the system on an infinite lattice , and in its evaluation the truncation is performed systematically in the tensor dimension . because it evaluates the partition function",
    ", this calculational approach gives access in principle to all thermodynamic quantities , and is not very resource - intensive in comparison with other numerical techniques .",
    "we apply the tensor - network approach to perform a detailed analysis of partial order in af potts models @xcite .",
    "we consider a number of irregular lattices in two dimensions , and calculate thermodynamic quantities including the entropy , specific heat , magnetization , and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we use these qualitatively to investigate the partial order or partial breaking of symmetry , which is shown by all the models , and quantitatively to characterize the phase transitions and partially ordered states .",
    "we find lower bounds for the critical values of @xmath0 on each lattice and illustrate the phenomenon of double phase transitions in particular models .",

    "vii we examine potts models on two lattices , which have a high ground - state degeneracy and do display partial order , but where the entropy is sub - extensive , i.e.  the residual entropy per site is @xmath10 .",
    "section viii contains a brief summary and conclusion .",
    "in a @xmath0-state potts model , the local variable at site @xmath11 may take one of @xmath0 different states , which we label as @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 consists of two terms , one for interactions between nearest - neighbor local variables for every bond of the lattice , and one for an external field @xmath14 coupled to one of the @xmath0 states and for one sublattice @xmath15 . in the ferromagnetic potts model , @xmath16 , a negative energy contribution is obtained if the neighboring sites are in the same state , while in the af case , @xmath17 , neighboring sites tend to occupy different states .    in the case",
    "@xmath16 , long - range order is favored and the ground state always has ferromagnetic order .",
    "it has been proven in two dimensions that the finite - temperature phase transition to a disordered state is continuous if @xmath18 and is first - order if @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "although there is no exact solution in three dimensions , numerical results @xcite indicate that a first - order phase transition occurs for @xmath20 .",
    "the af case is far richer and more complex .",
    "if the different local states are denoted by different colors , at zero temperature the neighboring sites should not have the same color .",
    "thus the af potts model at @xmath21 is equivalent to a vertex coloring problem .",
    "by using the dobrushin uniqueness theorem @xcite , salas and sokal @xcite proved that for sufficiently large @xmath0 the correlation function exhibits exponential decay at all temperatures , including @xmath21 .",
    "the model is therefore disordered even in the ground state , and no phase transition occurs . for small @xmath0 , by contrast , an ordered ( or , from above , partially ordered ) ground state is likely .",
    "based on this insight , it is thought that for every lattice there exists a value @xmath22 for which the system is disordered at all temperatures if @xmath23 . for @xmath24",
    "the system is critical at zero temperature , a situation we discuss below .",

    "the results for the @xmath26 on the square @xcite and kagome lattices @xcite , and @xmath1 = 4 for the triangular lattice @xcite are obtained from exact solutions at zero temperature , in which they are proved to be critical at these values of @xmath0 . on the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "the fractional value of the critical @xmath0 is determined by conjecture @xcite .",
    "the results for the decorated square and honeycomb lattices are obtained by mapping the af model to a ferromagnetic model whose critical value of @xmath0 is known @xcite .",
    "results for all other lattices are based on our calculations .",
    "table i shows a very close relationship between the lattice coordination number and @xmath1 , with larger values of @xmath4 requiring larger @xmath1 . beyond this coordination number ,",
    "however , it is clear that site equivalence also plays a key role .",
    "although the diced lattice has the same average coordination number as the square and kagome lattices , it shows a finite - temperature transition to a partially ordered ground state @xcite , and therefore @xmath27 .",
    "the crucial difference is that , while all sites in the regular square and kagome lattices are equivalent , the diced lattice is irregular , being composed of two inequivalent sublattices of three - fold and six - fold coordinated sites .",
    "lattices in which all sites are equivalent are known as archimedean .",
    "this category includes the honeycomb , square , kagome , and triangular lattices .",
    "there are 11 planar archimedean lattices , all of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ archimedean ] . on an archimedean lattice",
    ", the coordination number is the same for every site .",
    "the planar lattice is equivalent to a tiling of polygons , each site belonging to different polygons , but with the number and type of polygons to which each site belongs being the same .",
    "if the coordination number of the archimedean lattice is @xmath28 , the lattice is said to be `` @xmath29-colorable '' for any @xmath30 ; although this creates an af intersite color condition , there is no known relation between @xmath29 and @xmath1 .",
    "the archimedean lattices have systematic names . for",
    "any given vertex , the attached polygons are listed ( for example in clockwise order ) by their number of edges .",
    "while this process generates multiple names for several lattices , depending on the starting polygon , the convention is to choose the lexicographically shortest name by using exponents to abbreviate two or more consecutive entries .",
    "thus the square lattice is also known as @xmath31 , or @xmath32 , and this notation is used in fig .",
    "[ archimedean ] .",
    "the dual transformation of a planar lattice is defined by adding one site at the center of each polygon and connecting these new sites to those of all neighboring polygons .",
    "this is a vertex - to - face , face - to - vertex , edge - to - edge transformation , and is reversible .",
    "the square lattice is manifestly self - dual and the honeycomb and triangular lattices are mutually dual .",
    "however , the dual lattices of the remaining eight archimedean lattices are not archimedean ; clearly , the centering sites of the different polygons in these eight lattices have different connectivity .",
    "these are known as the laves lattices , and they are shown in fig .",
    "[ laves ] .",
    "the laves lattices with integer average coordination number @xmath4 play an important role in our considerations , and here we will study in detail the diced lattice ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , the union - jack lattice ( @xmath35 , @xmath4 = 6 ) , and the centered diced lattice ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) . according to the four - color theorem @xcite , a planar lattice may only be bipartite ( such as the diced lattice ) , tripartite ( such as the union - jack lattice ) , or quadripartite .",
    "the lattices we investigate in this paper are either bipartite or tripartite .",
    "a bipartite lattice contains only two sublattices of unconnected sites , and can be generated in one of two ways .",
    "one type is a lattice formed only by polygons with an even number of edges [ square , honeycomb , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , also the diced lattice ( @xmath33 ) ] . on these lattices ,",
    "each site a is connected only to sites of type b , and vice versa , and each polygon is composed alternately of a and b sites .",
    "the second type is the decorated lattice , formed by adding a site to each edge of a starting lattice .",
    "the original lattice sites and the decorating sites belong to different sublattices , and by taking a partial trace over the potts variables on the decorating sites , the @xmath0-state af potts model on a decorated lattice can always be mapped onto a ferromagnetic potts model with the same @xmath0 on the original lattice @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 af potts ( ising ) model on the bipartite lattice is always ordered at low temperature and disordered at high temperatures , with a finite - temperature phase transition .",
    "the @xmath5 af potts model on a bipartite lattice is more complicated , and its ground state can be disordered , critical , or ordered .",
    "typical examples of these cases are respectively the honeycomb , square , and diced lattices .",
    "there is in general no finite - temperature phase transition for the @xmath6 af potts model on bipartite lattices .",

    "any order in the ground state will be partial , because the model is frustrated on a tripartite lattice .",
    "the development of numerical methods for condensed matter and lattice systems based on tensor - network representations @xcite is motivated by developments in quantum information theory , and a great deal of progress has taken place in the last five years .",
    "tensor - based numerical methods have already been used to study spin @xcite , bosonic @xcite , and fermionic models @xcite , and to deal with quantum critical systems @xcite and topological quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "they have been combined with monte carlo techniques @xcite to take advantage of the best features of both methods and they have been extended to deal with classical systems such as classical xy models @xcite .",
    "when dealing with models in classical statistical mechanics , the quantity expressed as the contraction of a tensor network is the partition function . in one dimension , this quantity is a product of matrices , which is easy to evaluate . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the appropriate representation is by a network of tensors whose rank matches the coordination number of the lattice ; in this situation , the dimension of the tensors obtained after each contraction step increases if the same amount of information is to be stored , and so a truncation is required to keep the contraction under control .",
    "a large number of methods has been developed to perform this truncation , including the tensor renormalization group ( trg ) @xcite , second renormalization group @xcite , infinite time - evolving block decimation ( itebd ) @xcite , corner transfer matrix @xcite , plaquette renormalization group @xcite , and a renormalization - group method based on higher - order singular value decomposition ( hosvd ) @xcite .",

    "the partition function of a fpl model is @xmath154 where the fugacity @xmath29 is the weight of every loop , @xmath155 is the number of loops , and the sum is over all configurations @xmath156 of loops . because the edges of each loop may be red - blue - red - blue or blue - red - blue - red, the fugacity is @xmath157 .",
    "the @xmath157 fpl model is known @xcite to be critical on both the square and the honeycomb lattices , but not on the 4 - 8 lattice , which is completely consistent with the existence of partial order on the 4 - 8 lattice .    finally ,",

    "the primary focus of our investigation is the phenomenon of partial long - range order , which arises in the presence of high state degeneracies .",
    "quite generally , this partial order sets in at a `` finite - temperature phase transition , '' which is the defining property of the potts model in question , but whose properties can differ widely as a consequence of the interplay between lattice geometry and @xmath0 value .",
    "an essential ingredient of the partial ordering scenario is the nature of the lattice . in the absence of frustration , ordering transitions occur when the site coordination number @xmath28 constrains the number of degrees of freedom @xmath0 . for sufficiently large @xmath0 , the af potts model on any lattice",
    "is insufficiently constrained and is disordered at all temperatures . in restricting our considerations to archimedean and laves lattices , one of the key qualitative properties of a lattice is whether it is regular ( all sites equivalent ) or irregular , meaning that it has different types of site with different local coordination numbers . while both types of system may possess a large number of potts configurations minimizing the total energy , the irregular lattices have nontrivial entropies , which in a number of cases drive only a partial ordering transition on some of the inequivalent sublattices .",
    "the majority of our results are obtained for three particular laves lattices , the diced , union - jack , and centered diced lattices , which have integer average coordination number @xmath4 but behavior rather different from regular lattices with @xmath320 .",
    "specifically , for the value @xmath321 where the regular lattice is critical , they all show finite - temperature transitions to states of partial order .",
    "thus the irregular lattice geometry leads quite generally to high values of @xmath1 ( indeed , @xmath322 for @xmath128 on the centered diced lattice ) .",
    "the entropic selection mechanism is such that the partial order is always on the site of highest local coordination , which creates a high number of satisfied bonds while imposing a @xmath323 potts degeneracy on all of the connected sites .",
    "the finite - temperature transitions from partially ordered states to disordered states may in different cases be very obvious or extremely subtle .",
    "we have analyzed both types and shown that this is a function of the number of competing partially ordered states ; when there is no unique sublattice with the largest connectivity , then the system must resolve this competition and the result can be a very weak transition . indeed , the existence of inequivalent sites in a lattice can not on its own guarantee a partially ordered ground state , because sufficiently large @xmath0 will always cause disorder , and so the existence of order must be tested in every case .",
    "however , the effectiveness of thermal fluctuations in suppressing the partial order parameter is determined not only by the number of degenerate states in the manifold but also by the nature of the competition between partially ordered states .",
    "another factor in this competition can be the nature of the entropic driving forces . in most of the models",
    "we have studied , the entropy of the ground manifold of minimum - energy states is extensive , scaling with the volume of the system .",
    "however , we have also discovered some situations where the balance of connectivity ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath0 , and the interactions ( @xmath195 ) is such that the ground state has one - dimensional correlations and the degeneracy scales only with the linear dimension of the system . despite the resulting sub - extensive entropy ,",
    "the ground manifold remains highly degenerate , and this is sufficient to preserve the physics of partial order .",
    "we comment here that we have largely avoided considering systems with frustrated interactions .",
    "frustration is regarded as a very general driving force for ( complete ) suppression of order parameters and in certain systems for the existence of only partially ordered ground states .",
    "the family of af potts models can largely be categorized into three regimes , one with @xmath324 , which exhibits disorder at all temperatures , one with ( crudely ) @xmath325 , which exhibits phenomena including zero - temperature criticality and entropy - driven partial order , and one with @xmath326 where the ground state usually has complete order .",
    "frustration is the key factor affecting the nature and extent of order in the last of these categories .",
    "this paper concerns almost exclusively the intermediate category , where entropic effects dominate and frustration is absent  quite simply , a triangle is not a frustrated unit when @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to partially ordered ground states , we have also investigated the formation of partially ordered states at intermediate temperatures . in the models we consider ,",
    "these occur in systems with conventional , fully ordered ground states , which are also states of low ( or zero ) degeneracy . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the huge entropic preference for partially ordered states of high degeneracy can drive an additional phase transition .",
    "the typical regime for this type of behavior is where @xmath0 is slightly smaller than in the systems with partially ordered ground states .",
    "the consequence is a system with multiple phase transitions , from order to partial order at low temperatures and then from partial order to complete disorder , which we are able to characterize completely by computing the magnetizations on every sublattice .",
    "potts models possess both the symmetry of their lattice and the @xmath0-fold permutation symmetry of the potts variable , and models showing separate phase transitions give a very clear example of sequential breaking or restoration of partial symmetries , which can be used to classify the transition type ( universality class)@xcite .",
    "one of the key features of our calculations is that they yield quantitative thermodynamic information about potts models , and in particular about the partially ordered states at low temperatures .",
    "highly accurate values for the entropies and magnetizations can be compared with expectations for different , competing , partially ordered model states , to deduce their contributions to the true ground state . in this study",
    ", we have exposed a number of models where the thermodynamic properties do not match with naive expectations based on perfect order on the highest - coordinated sublattice . for reasons of space ,",
    "we have not dwelled on the development of scenarios for improving the analytical description of potts states , although our data allow direct comparisons with models for the leading `` defect '' configurations within a state of perfect partial order .",
    "when these defects are present at finite densities due to their entropic contributions , their effects will be observable in the entropy and sublattice magnetization we compute .",
    "our results also permit detailed comparisons with different models in classical statistical mechanics , further developing cross - links within the field .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated the power of tensor - based numerical methods for problems in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the ability to express the partition function as a tensor product , to renormalize systematically , and to truncate in the tensor dimension , gives unprecedented access to accurate thermodynamic information .",
    "the method is completely general in that calculations can be performed for all lattice geometries and all values of @xmath0 , with no restrictions to special cases .",
    "we have exploited this power to find and characterize previously unknown phase transitions , to quantify thermodynamic properties both at the transition and at low temperatures , and thus to gain extra insight into the physics of partial ordering processes .",
    "we close by noting that the development of tensor - based numerical techniques remains in its relative infancy , and that significant improvements in size ( tensor dimension ) and accuracy may still be expected .",
    "this would make possible a new level of quantitative discussion for topics such as scaling exponents and universality at phase transitions , which are currently still at the frontiers of our capabilities .",
