    "the behaviour of nuclear matter at the extreme densities reached in neutron - star cores is determined by the properties of fundamental interactions in regimes that are still poorly known and that are not accessible in experiments on earth . a broad variety of different models for supernuclear matter , and thus for the inner structure of neutron stars , has been proposed .",
    "although neutron - star properties depend sensitively on the equation of state ( eos ) , approximately `` universal '' relations between several dimensionless quantities have been found during the last years .",
    "the `` universal '' character in these relations comes from their weak dependence on the eos and this allows one to use them to constrain quantities that are difficult to access experimentally , such as the neutron star radius .    already in 1994",
    ", @xcite highlighted an apparently universal relation between the normalized moment of inertia @xmath3 and the stellar compactness @xmath4 in the case of eoss without an extreme softening at supernuclear densities .",
    "this relation was later refined by @xcite and @xcite , and then employed by @xcite to point out that using such an empirical relation it is possible to estimate the radius of a neutron star via the combined measurement of the mass and moment of inertia of a pulsar in a binary system .",
    "additional evidence that eos - independent relations could be found among quantities characterizing compact stars was also pointed out by @xcite [ and later on revisited by @xcite ] , who showed that a tight correlation exists between the frequency of the fundamental mode of oscillation and the stellar average density .",
    "more recently , however , @xcite have found that suitably normalized expressions for the moment of inertia @xmath5 , the quadrupole moment @xmath6 and the tidal love number @xmath7 are related by functions independent of the eos to within @xmath8 in the slow - rotation approximation and assuming small tidal deformations [ see also the related and earlier work by @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "these relations are particularly useful as they may help remove some degeneracies as those appearing , for instance , in the modelling of the gravitational - wave signal from inspiralling binaries [ see @xcite ; @xcite for a discussion ] .",
    "the universality , however , should be meant as approximate and is indeed preserved only within large but defined regimes , such as the slow - rotation approximation or when the magnetic fields are not particularly strong .",
    "more specifically , it has been shown by @xcite that the universality in the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 breaks down in the case of rapid rotation for sequences with constant spin frequency .",
    "this result was partially revised by @xcite , who have shown that the @xmath5@xmath6 universality is partly recovered if the rotation is characterized not by the spin frequency , but by the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the angular momentum and mass of the star , respectively [ see also @xcite ] . at the same time , @xcite have shown that the universality between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is lost for stars with long spin periods , i.e. ,  @xmath12s , and strong magnetic fields , i.e. ,  @xmath13 g .",
    "the reason behind this behaviour is rather simple : the anisotropic stresses introduced by a magnetic field can break the overall spherical symmetry present for stars that are nonrotating or in slow rotation . in turn , this affects the universal behaviour , which is based on the balance between gravity and the behaviour of fluids in strong gravitational fields .    over the last couple of years ,",
    "this area of research has been extremely active , with investigations that have considered universality also with higher multipoles @xcite or that have sought universality in response to alternative theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "a large bulk of work has also tried to provide a phenomenological justification for the existence of such a behaviour .",
    "for instance , it has been suggested that @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 are determined mostly by the behaviour of matter at comparatively low rest - mass densities , where realistic eoss do not differ significantly because they are better constrained by nuclear - physics experiments @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that the multipole moments approach the limiting values of a black hole towards high compactness , which implies that approximate no - hair - like relations exist also for non - vacuum spacetimes @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been proposed that nuclear - physics eoss are stiff enough that the nuclear matter can be modelled with an incompressible eos . in this interpretation , low - mass stars , which are composed mainly of soft matter at low densities ,",
    "would depend more sensitively on the underlying eos , while the universality is much stronger towards higher compactness , where matter approaches the limit of an incompressible fluid @xcite .    in this paper , we take a slightly different view and reconsider well - known universal relations to devise an effective tool to constrain the radius of a compact star from the combined knowledge of the mass and moment of inertia in a binary system containing a pulsar . more specifically ,",
    "we first show that a universal relation holds for the maximum mass of uniformly rotating stars when expressed in terms of the dimensionless and normalized angular momentum .",
    "this relation extends and provides a natural explanation for the evidence brought about by @xcite of a proportionality between the maximum mass allowed by uniform rotation and the maximum mass of the corresponding nonrotating configuration .",
    "finally , we show that the dimensionless moment of inertia @xmath14 for slowly rotating compact stars correlates tightly and universally with the compactness @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the radius of the star .",
    "next , we provide an analytical expression for such a correlation and show that it improves on previous expressions , yielding relative errors in the estimate of the radius that are @xmath17 for a large range of masses and moment of inertia",
    ". we should note that universal relations @xmath18@xmath7 and @xmath7@xmath19 have been shown to hold by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that a universal relation @xmath18@xmath19 also holds .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that such a relation is discussed in detail and that its implications are investigated in terms of astrophysical measurements .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : setup ] , we briefly review the mathematical and numerical setup used for the calculation of our equilibrium stellar models ( from nonrotating configurations to rapidly rotating ones ) .",
    "section [ sec : maximumass ] is dedicated to our results and in particular to the new universal relation between the maximum mass and the normalized angular momentum .",
    "section [ sec : results ] is instead dedicated to the comparison between our expression for the dimensionless moment of inertia and previous results in the literature , while in section [ sec : applications ] we discuss how the new relation can be used to deduce the radius of a compact star once a measurement is made of its mass and moment of inertia . finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions and prospects for future work ; the appendix provides the derivation of an analytic expression to evaluate the relative error in the estimate .",
    "we have constructed a large number of equilibrium models of compact stars that are either nonrotating , slowly or rapidly rotating . in the first two cases",
    ", solutions can be obtained after the integration of ordinary differential equations in spherical symmetry , while in the third case we have made use of a two - dimensional numerical code solving elliptic partial differential equations .",
    "more specifically , we consider the stellar matter as a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath22 the four - metric , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fluid energy density and pressure , respectively . in the case of non - rotating stars ,",
    "we take a spherically symmetric metric @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are metric functions of the radial coordinate @xmath28 only .",
    "equilibrium models are then found as solutions of the tolman ",
    "oppenheimer  volkoff ( tov ) equations @xmath29 where the function @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 these tov equations need to be supplemented with an eos providing a relation between different thermodynamic quantities , and we have used 15 nuclear - physics eoss in tabulated form . for all of them ,",
    "beta equilibrium and zero temperature were assumed , so that the eos reduces to a relation between the pressure and the rest - mass density ( or the energy density ) . for more complex eoss",
    "in which a temperature dependence is available , we have used the slice at the lowest temperature . in our analysis",
    "we have considered 28 several different theoretical approaches to the eos and , in particular : the nuclear many - body theory [ apr4 , @xcite ; wff1 , wff2 , @xcite ] , the non - relativistic skyrme mean - field model [ rs , sk255 , sk272 , ska , skb , ski2-ski6 , skmp , @xcite , sly2 , sly4 , sly9 , @xcite ] , the mean - field theory approach [ eos l , @xcite ; hs dd2 , hs nl3 , hs tm1 , hs tma , sfho , sfhx , @xcite ; gshen - nl3 , @xcite , the walecka model [ eos - o , @xcite ] and the liquid - drop model [ ls220 ; @xcite ] .",
    "all of these models are able to support a neutron star with a maximum mass of at least 2.0 @xmath32 and are therefore compatible with the discovery of neutron stars with masses of about 2 @xmath32 @xcite . at the same time",
    ", we note that because strong phase transitions above nuclear saturation density can affect the radii of low - mass neutron stars , determining whether a phase transition occurs ( and if so at which rest - mass density ) represents an important consideration not contemplated in these eoss , but that will be the focus of future work .",
    "it is possible to extend the validity of the tov solutions by considering stellar models in the slow - rotation approximation @xcite .",
    "however , already in @xcite , a full second - order treatment was developed , and subsequently applied by @xcite for a systematic study of rotating relativistic stars . ] . in this case , spherical symmetry is still preserved , but rotational corrections do appear at first order in the stellar angular velocity @xmath33 , and the line element is replaced by its slow - rotation counterpart @xcite @xmath34\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are still functions of the radial coordinate only and @xmath35 represents the angular velocity of the inertial frames dragged by the stellar rotation .",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : m])([eq : nu ] ) needs then to be augmented with a differential equation for the relative angular velocity @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the difference between the angular velocity @xmath38 acquired by an observer falling freely from infinity and the angular velocity of a fluid element measured by an observer at rest at some point in the fluid .",
    "a numerical solution to equations ( [ eq : m])([eq : omega ] ) can be obtained by integrating them outwards from the stellar centre using , for instance , a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm . at the stellar surface",
    ", @xmath39 must be matched to the analytic exterior solution which has the form @xmath40 where @xmath10 is the total angular momentum of the star .",
    "the integration , which can be started with an arbitrary value for @xmath39 , can then be adjusted so as to match the boundary condition .",
    "once a slowly rotating solution with angular momentum @xmath10 and spin frequency @xmath33 has been found , the corresponding moment of inertia can then be computed as @xmath41 where the derivative in the last equality is meant to be taken at the stellar surface .",
    "note that at this order the angular momentum @xmath10 depends linearly on the angular velocity @xmath33 , so that the moment of inertia does not depend on @xmath33 .",
    "quite generically , the moment of inertia increases almost linearly with the mass for sufficiently small masses ; however , as the maximum mass is approached , it decreases rapidly .",
    "this behaviour is due to the fact that @xmath5 depends quadratically on the radius , which decreases significantly near the maximum mass .",
    "we should note that treatments higher than the first - order in @xmath33 have been also presented , in @xcite , where even the third - order terms were included [ see also @xcite ] .",
    "these treatments , however , are still not very accurate for rapidly rotating models of compact stars .",
    "hence , we have relied on fully numerical solutions constructed using the open - source code rns , which solves the einstein equations in axisymmetry and in the conformally flat approximation @xcite . in this case , the spacetime is assumed to be stationary and axisymmetric , and can be described by a metric of the form @xmath42 where the metric potentials @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath38 are functions of the quasi - isotropic coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath46 .",
    "stellar models can then be computed along sequences in which the central energy density and the axis ratio ( or spin frequency ) is varied @xcite .",
    "with the exception of those works that have looked at the existence of universality in merging systems of neutron - star binaries @xcite , all of the work done so far on universal relations in isolated relativistic stars has concentrated on _ stable _ equilibrium configurations .",
    "this is of course the most natural part of the space of parameters that is worth investigating .",
    "yet , it is interesting to assess whether universality is present also for stellar models that are either marginally stable or that actually represent unstable equilibrium models . to this scope",
    ", we have investigated whether a universal behaviour can be found also for models whose gravitational mass is at the critical - mass limit or reasonably close to it .",
    "we recall that @xcite proved that a sequence of uniformly rotating barotropic stars is secularly unstable on one side of a turning point , i.e. ,  when it is an extremum of mass along a sequence of constant angular momentum , or an extremum of angular momentum along a sequence of constant rest - mass . furthermore , arguing that viscosity would lead to uniform rotation , they concluded that the turning point should identify the onset of secular instability .",
    "while for nonrotating stars the turning point does coincides with the secular - instability point ( and with the dynamical - instability point for a barotropic star if the perturbation satisfies the same equation of state of the equilibrium model ) , for rotating stars it is only a sufficient condition for a secular instability , although it is commonly used to find a dynamical instability in simulations  @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have computed the neutral - stability line for a large class of stellar models , i.e. ,  the set of stellar models whose @xmath47-mode frequency is vanishingly small ; such a neutral - stability point in a nonrotating star marks the dynamical - stability limit . the latter coincides with the turning - point line of  @xcite for nonrotating stars , but differs from it as the angular momentum is increased , being located at smaller central rest - mass densities as the angular momentum is increased .",
    "stated differently , the results of @xcite have shown that equilibrium stellar models on the turning - point line are effectively dynamically _",
    "unstable_. this result , which was also confirmed by numerical simulations , does not contradict turning - point criterion since the latter is only a sufficient condition for secular instability [ see also the discussion by @xcite ] .    determining the critical mass in a way that is independent of the eos is critical in many astrophysical scenarios , starting from those that want to associate fast radio bursts @xcite to a `` blitzar '' and hence to the collapse of a supramassive neutron star @xcite , over to those that apply this scenario to the merger of binary neutron - star systems @xcite and are thus interested in the survival time of the merger to extract information on the eos @xcite , or to those scenarios in which the late collapse of the binary merger product can be used to explain the extended x - ray emission in short gamma - ray burst @xcite .",
    "we should note that this is not the first time that `` universal '' relations in the critical mass are considered .",
    "indeed , @xcite have already discussed that there is a close correlation between the `` mass - shedding '' ( or keplerian ) frequency @xmath48 and the mass and radius of the maximum mass configuration in the limit of no rotation , i.e. ,  @xmath1 and @xmath49 .",
    "because larger masses can support larger keplerian frequencies , the maximum critical mass is defined as the largest mass for stellar models on the critical ( turning - point ) line . after considering a large set of eoss ,",
    "@xcite have shown that there exists a universal proportionality between the radii and masses of maximally rotating and of static configurations .    in view of the simplicity of computing stellar models on the turning - point line and given that these models are very close to those on the neutral - stability line , we have computed the maximum masses of models along constant angular momentum - sequences , i.e. ,  such that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the central rest - mass density .",
    "although these models are strictly speaking unstable , for simplicity we have dubbed them `` critical masses '' , @xmath52 .",
    "the values of these masses as a function of the angular momentum @xmath10 are reported in the left panel of of fig .",
    "[ fig : critical ] , which shows that a large variance exists with the eos when the data is reported in this way .",
    "each sequence terminates with the `` maximum '' ( critical ) mass that is supported via ( uniform ) rotation @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the maximum angular momentum that can be attained normalised to the maximum mass , i.e. ,  @xmath55 .",
    "note that the maximum mass in this case can range from values as small as @xmath56 for @xmath57 , up to @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "the same data , however , can be expressed in terms of dimensionless quantities and , more specifically , in terms of the critical mass normalised to the maximum value of the corresponding nonrotating configuration , i.e. ,  @xmath60 and of the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath61 when the latter is normalized to the maximum value allowed for that eos , @xmath54 .",
    "such a data is collected in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : critical ] and shows that the variance in this case is extremely small .",
    "indeed , it is possible to express such a behaviour with a simple polynomial fitting function of the type @xmath62 where the coefficients are found to be @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with a reduced chi squared @xmath65 and where , of course , @xmath66 for @xmath67 .    an immediate consequence of eq .",
    "is also a very important result .",
    "irrespective of the eos , in fact , the maximum mass that can be supported through uniform rotation is simply obtained after setting @xmath68 and is therefore given by @xmath69 where we have taken as error not the statistical one ( which would be far smaller ) but the largest one shown in the comparison between the fit and the data .    in summary ,",
    "although different eoss give substantially different maximum masses and are able to reach substantially different angular momenta , the maximum mass that can be supported at the mass - shedding limit is essentially universal and is about 20% larger than the corresponding amount in the absence of rotation . also shown in the bottom part of the panel is the relative error between the normalised critical mass @xmath70 and its estimate coming from the fit , @xmath71 .",
    "note that the error for the largest angular momentum is below @xmath72 for all the eoss considered and that it is below @xmath73 for most rotation rates .",
    "similar conclusions on the maximum mass were reached also by @xcite , although with a larger variance , probably due to the use of eoss that did not satisfy the constraint of @xmath74 and different normalizations .",
    "this confirms the idea that the uncertainties in correlations of this type could be further reduced if future observations will increase the value of the maximum mass @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "more importantly , expression highlights that a universal relation is present not only for the maximum critical mass , but is is valid also for any value of the dimensionless angular momentum , with a variance that is actually smaller for slowly rotating models .",
    "this is a result that was not discussed by @xcite .    despite the important implications that expression has , its use in the form above",
    "is very limited as it requires the implicit knowledge of @xmath75 , as well as of @xmath61 and @xmath76 .",
    "a way round this limitation is possible if one makes the reasonable assumption that for a given angular momentum , the mass and radius of the mass - shedding model is proportional to the mass and radius of the maximum - mass nonrotating model , i.e. ,  @xmath77 and that the keplerian frequency follows the classical scaling in mass and radius @xmath78 as a result , the angular momentum at the mass - shedding limit can be expressed also as a function of the maximum - mass nonrotating configuration @xmath79 and thus @xmath80 the coefficients @xmath81 , and @xmath82 can be computed via a fit to the data , yielding : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , while the coefficient @xmath86 can be derived as @xmath87 . alternatively , and more accurately ,",
    "@xmath86 can be computed via a direct fit of expression , which then yields @xmath88 .",
    "we can now use expression in the dimensionless fit to obtain @xmath89 where the coefficients have numerical values @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "expression has the desired features , since the critical mass is now function only of the stellar angular momentum @xmath10 and of the properties ( mass and radius ) of the maximum - mass nonorotating configuration , @xmath1 and @xmath49 .",
    "note that expression is not in an explicit form , since the right - hand side still contains information on the critical mass via @xmath92 .",
    "however , a simple root - finding algorithm can be used to obtain @xmath93 once @xmath10 , @xmath1 , and @xmath49 are specified .",
    "in what follows we discuss universal relations between the moment of inertia @xmath94 and the compactness @xmath19 . we will first consider the case of slowly rotating stars ( section [ sec : ic_sr ] ) and then that of rapidly rotating ones ( section [ sec : ic_rr ] ) .      starting with @xcite , a number of authors have pointed out that the dimensionless moment of inertia @xmath95 can be expressed in terms of the stellar compactness @xmath19 via simple low - order polynomial expressions that have a weak dependence on the eos .",
    "expressions of this type have been proposed by @xcite , as well as by @xcite , with comparable level of precision .",
    "a higher - order polynomial fit was proposed subsequently by @xcite ( ls ) , who expressed it as @xmath96 and discussed how such a relation could be used to constrain the stellar radius once @xmath5 and @xmath11 are measured , e.g. ,  in a pulsar within a binary system .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ls ] reports with a scatter plot the values of @xmath97 relative to slowly rotating stars [ i.e. ,  stars treated in the slow - rotation approximation ] as computed for a number of different eoss and in a large range of compactnesses , i.e. ,  with @xmath98 $ ] ; this is also the range in compactness over which the fits are performed .",
    "different symbols and colours refer to different eoss as reported in the legend .",
    "also indicated with a black solid line is the ls fit expressed by , while the shaded band band reports the error in the fitting coefficients .",
    "the fitting coefficients found originally by @xcite are : @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , while those produced by our analysis are slightly different and given by : @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the main differences in the estimates ( especially in the quartic term ) are due to the different set of eoss used and , more importantly , to the fact that the estimates by @xcite were based in part on eoss which are now excluded by observations of a 2 @xmath105 neutron star .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that fitting functions of the type were valid for a wide range of eos except the ones which exhibited extreme softening .",
    "this is measured by the relative error @xmath106 , which is reported in the lower part of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ls ] , and which shows the errors are generally below @xmath107 . at the same time",
    ", the large scatter of the data suggests that a tighter fit could be obtained if a different normalization is found for the moment of inertia .",
    "hence , inspired by the normalization s proposed by @xcite and @xcite , we have considered to fit the moment of inertia through a functional expansion of the type @xmath108 there are two main motivations behind this choice .",
    "the first one is that it is clear that at lowest order @xmath109 and hence an expansion in terms of inverse powers of the compactness is rather natural .",
    "the second one is the realisation that universal relations exist between @xmath110 and @xmath7 @xcite and between @xmath7 and @xmath19 @xcite , so that a universal relation should also exist also between @xmath110 and @xmath19 , although not yet discussed in the literature .",

    ". the last column reports instead the largest infinity norm , i.e. ,  the largest residual across all eoss .",
    "the values of the last two columns are reported as shaded areas ( red and blue , respectively ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : ls ] . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]            three remarks are worth making .",
    "first , the fitting could be further improved if the normalization of the moment of inertia is modified in terms of dimensionless quantities , e.g. ,  a given power of the compactness as suggested by @xcite .",
    "while useful to tighten the fit , we are not certain that this approach is effective in general or provides additional insight ; hence , we will not adopt it here .",
    "second , the quantity @xmath18 is sometimes associated to what is called the `` effective compactness '' @xmath113 @xcite , where one is considering that @xmath114 .",
    "clearly , as the fit in expression reveals , this association is reasonable only at the lowest order . finally , while the relation @xmath18@xmath19 provides a description of the universal behaviour of the moment of inertia that is slightly more accurate than the one captured by the @xmath97@xmath19 relation , the visual impression provided by fig .",
    "[ fig : ls ] enhances the impression of a better fit for the @xmath18@xmath19 relation . in practice , the much larger range span by @xmath18 across the relevant compactnesses induces one to believe that the universality is far superior in this latter case . as testified by the data in the lower plots , the error is , on average , only slightly smaller .      as mentioned in section [ sec : setup ] , within the slow - rotation approximation the properties of the compact stars do not depend on the magnitude of rotation and the surface is still given by a 2-sphere of constant radial coordinate .",
    "when the stars are rapidly rotating , on the other hand , not only the effect of the frame dragging needs to be included , but also the change in the stellar surface needs to be taken into account . more specifically , as a rotating star approaches the `` mass - shedding '' ( or keplerian ) limit , that is , the limit at which it is spinning so fast so as to lose matter at the equator , its mass and equatorial radius increase while the polar radius decreases , leading to an overall oblate shape . since the moment of inertia is influenced mostly by the mass in the outer regions of the star , the increases in mass and radius lead quite generically to larger moments of inertia .",
    "since the @xmath5@xmath7@xmath6 universal relations were first discussed in the limit of slow rotation and small tidal deformations , @xcite have investigated the impact of rapid uniform rotation on these relations and , in particular , on the between the moment of inertia for sequences with constant angular velocity @xmath33 .",
    "what was found in this case is that the @xmath115 universality was lost , with deviations from the slow - rotation limit of up to 40% with increasing rotation rate .",
    "interestingly , however , @xcite also found that the universality is restored ( within limits ) if the dimensionless moment of inertia is ordered not along sequences of constant @xmath33 , but along sequences of constant dimensionless spin parameter @xmath116 .",
    "in particular , along each sequence the @xmath115 relation is independent of the eos up to about 1% , but it is of course a function of the spin parameter @xmath61 .    hence , it is natural to investigate whether the @xmath117 relation we have discussed in the previous section in the case of slowly rotating stars , continues to be valid also in the case of rapid rotation .",
    "this is summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsrot ] , whose two panels show respectively @xmath97 and @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 , with the shaded band marking the uncertainty band coming from the fit within the slow - rotation approximation , the data reported in fig . [",

    "[ fig : ls ] , i.e. ,  eoss : apr4 , sly4 , ls220 , wff1 , wff2 , l , n , o , hs @xmath118 , hs @xmath119 , hs @xmath120 , hs @xmath121 , sfho , sfhx . ] .",
    "following @xcite , and expecting it will yield a tighter correlation , we order the data along sequences of constant @xmath61 .",
    "note that while the data for @xmath122 ( red symbols ) lies almost on top of the results for the slow - rotation limit , the sequences for @xmath123 ( light - green ) show larger deviations , and for @xmath124 ( blue symbols ) the data lies completely outside of the error band for the slow - rotation fit .",
    "indeed , along the @xmath124 sequence , which is also near the mass - shedding limit for most eoss , the deviation in the fitted range can be as large as @xmath125 .    despite the complete loss of universality at high rotation rates and small compactnesses , and the fact that universality is present only along specific directions ( i.e. ,  @xmath126 sequences ) , the @xmath97@xmath19 relation remains effective for a large portion of the space of parameters .",
    "we recall , in fact , that the fastest known rotating pulsar has a spin frequency of 716 hz ( or a period of @xmath127 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could correspond to @xmath128 depending on the pulsar s mass @xcite . for the eoss used here , however , @xmath129 for this pulsar and would therefore lie within the error band of the fit for the slow - rotation limit for most of that range .",
    "for completeness , and following what was done for the slow - rotation approximation , we report in table [ table : fit_coeffs ] the numerical values of the fitting coefficients in eq . for the various @xmath126 sequences considered .",
    "already @xcite had pointed out that the binding energy of a compact star , defined as the difference between the total rest mass @xmath130 and the gravitational mass of an equilibrium configuration , @xmath131 could show a behaviour that is essentially independent of the eos . in particular , considering the dimensionless binding energy @xmath132 , @xcite found a good fit to the data with an expression of the type @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we have revisited the ansatz using more modern eoss satisfying the two solar - mass constraint and found that the fit to the data yields values for the coefficients and in particular that @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the reduced chi squared for the two different sets of coefficients is different , being @xmath138 for the original fit of @xcite and of @xmath139 for our new fit .    yet , because expression is effectively a second - order polynomial for small values of @xmath19 , we have also considered a different functional form for the fitting ansatz and which , in the spirit of expression , is a quadratic polynomial in the stellar compactness , i.e. ,  @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the fit in this case is marginally better than that obtained with expression , with a reduced chi square of @xmath143 .",
    "all things considered , and on the basis of the eoss used here , expression is only a marginally better description of the functional behaviour of the reduced binding energy and should be considered effectively equivalent to expression .",
    "interestingly , expression can also be easily extended to encompass the case of rotating stars after replacing the coefficients @xmath144 and @xmath145 with new expressions that contain rotation - induced corrections in terms of the dimensionless angular momentum , i.e. ,  @xmath146 and @xmath147 in , where @xmath148 where @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "note that the linear coefficients are very small , as are the errors in the estimates of the quadratic coefficients .",
    "the reduced chi square obtained when comparing the values of the reduced binding energy @xmath132 obtained via  with those obtained from the rns is rather small and given by @xmath153 .",
    "finally , we note that expressing the binding energy in terms of the radius rather than of the mass changes the functional behaviour of the fitting function since @xmath154 , but not the overall quality of the fit .",
    "while the origin of the universal relations is still unclear and the subject of an intense research ( and debate ) , we take here the more pragmatic view in which universal relations are seen as an interesting behaviour of compact stars in a special area of the space of solutions : namely , those of slowly rotating , low - magnetisation stars . in this view",
    ", universal relations can be used to constrain phenomenologically quantities which are not directly accessible by observations or whose behaviour is degenerate .",
    "for instance , the simultaneous measurement of the mass and of the moment of inertia of a compact star , e.g. ,  of a pulsar in a binary system of compact stars , does not necessarily provide information on the radius . on the other hand , the same measurements , together with the use of the universal relation ( [ eq : br_fit ] ) can set constraints on the radius and hence on the eos . to illustrate how this can be done in practice",
    "let us consider the case in which the moment of inertia is measured with an observational error of 10% ; this may well be an optimistic expectation but is not totally unrealistic [ a similar assumption was made also by @xcite ] .",
    "if the mass is observed with a much larger precision [ as it is natural to expect from pulsar measurements in binary neutron - star systems  @xcite ] , then it is possible to define regions in the @xmath155 plane that are compatible with such observations . in turn , the comparison with the expectations from different eoss will set constraints on the radius of the star .    in practice , given a measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath11 , it is sufficient to invert the fitting function ( [ eq : br_fit ] ) to obtain the range of radii that is compatible with the measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath11 . examples of these compatibility regions in the @xmath155 plane are represented by the coloured shaded regions in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : radiusconstr ] , where we have considered respectively @xmath156 ( red - shaded region ) , @xmath157 ( green - shaded region ) , and @xmath158 ( blue - shaded region ) ) . ] . given then a measure of the mass (",
    "we have considered a canonical mass of @xmath159 and indicated it with an horizontal black dashed line ) , the intersection of the corresponding constraint with a given shaded region sets a range for the possible value of the radius .",
    "for instance , a measurement of @xmath157 and @xmath159 would require radii in excess of @xmath160 , thus excluding relatively soft eoss such as apr4 .",
    "similar considerations can be made also for rapidly rotating stars .",
    "this is shown as is shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : radiusconstr ] , where we consider again three different hypothetical measurements of the moment of inertia , but also consider the extension of the universal relation along sequences of constant dimensionless spin parameter @xmath61 . we indicate with a black solid line the fit relative to the slowly rotating models and with red , green and blue dashed lines the fits corresponding to @xmath161 , and @xmath124 , respectively . note that even the largest considered value for @xmath61 , the sequences are within the error bands imposed by the observational error on @xmath5 and by the uncertainties on the fitting function .",
    "following the considerations above , we next compute the error made in estimating the radius of the star for any eos once a measurement is made of @xmath5 and @xmath11 . to this scope",
    "we need to account both for the error due to the observational uncertainty of the moment of inertia and for the error on the fitting function . because the error on the fit ( [ eq : br_fit ] ) is of the order of 5% for a large part of the considered range in the compactness",
    ", the error on the radius made when inverting the fitting function ( [ eq : br_fit ] ) can be estimated via the standard gaussian error - propagation law .",
    "more specifically , we assume that the total error in the radius estimate is given by the sum in quadrature of two errors , i.e. ,  @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the error in the fit when computed as the @xmath164-norm of the relative deviation of the fit from the data [ cf . ,   eq . ] , while @xmath165 is the error in the observed moment of inertia .",
    "the error on the fit is approximately given by @xmath166 where @xmath164 is the maximum relative error @xmath167 .",

    "different colours refer to different values of the moment of inertia ( red , green and blue lines for @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively ) .",
    "the error estimates includes an observational uncertainty of the moment of inertia of 10% and the error on the fitting function . ]    figure [ fig : err ] summarises the results of this error analysis by reporting the relative error in the measurement of the stellar radius @xmath170 for any eos once the mass of the star is measured to high precision and the moment of inertia is estimated with a relative error of @xmath107 .",
    "more specifically , eqs . and",
    "are inverted numerically to estimate @xmath16 from @xmath11 and @xmath5 , while @xmath171 is computed as the difference between the radius obtained from the inverted fitting function and the inverted relation with the errors on the moment of inertia and the fitting function taken into account .",
    "figure [ fig : err ] shows this relative error @xmath170 as a function of the measured mass and also in this case we report with lines of different colours the three different hypothetical measurements of the moment of inertia .",
    "note that we indicate with solid lines the errors deduced using the new fit ( br fit ) and with dashed lines the corresponding fit coming from expression of @xcite ( ls fit ) .",
    "the two prescriptions provide rather different behaviours in the error estimates as a function of mass .",
    "in particular , for small masses , i.e. ,  @xmath172 , the modelling in terms of @xmath97 and @xmath18 yield comparable errors . however , for large masses , i.e. ,  @xmath173 , the modelling in terms of @xmath18 yields considerably smaller errors .",
    "we have shown that a universal relation is exhibited also by equilibrium solutions that are not stable .",
    "in particular , we have considered uniformly rotating configurations on the turning - point line , that is , whose mass is an extremum along a sequence of constant angular momentum .",
    "such stellar configurations are unstable since they are found at larger central rest - mass densities than those that on the neutral - point line and therefore marginally stable @xcite .",
    "while hints of this relation were already discussed in the literature @xcite , we have here shown that it holds not only for the maximum value of the angular momentum , but also for any rotation rate .",
    "the importance of this universal relation is that it has allowed us to compute the maximum mass sustainable through rapid uniform rotation , finding that for any eos it is about 20% larger than the maximum mass supported by the corresponding nonrotating configuration .",
    "finally , using universal relations for some of the properties of compact stars , we have revisited the possibility of constraining the radius of a compact star from the combined measurement of its mass and moment of inertia , as is expected to be possible in a binary system containing a pulsar . in particular , after considering both stellar models in the slow - rotation approximation and in very rapid rotation , we have shown that the dimensionless moment of inertia @xmath174 for slowly rotating compact stars correlates tightly and universally with the stellar compactness @xmath175 in a manner that does not depend on the eos .",
    "we have also derived an analytical expression for such a correlation , which improves on a previous expression obtained with the dimensionless moment of inertia @xmath176 @xcite .    assuming that a measurement of the moment of inertia is made with a realistic precision of 10% and that a much more accurate measurement is made of the mass",
    ", we have found that the new relation yields relative errors in the estimate of the stellar radius that are @xmath17 for a large range of masses and moment of inertia .",
    "radius measurements of this precision have the potential of setting serious constraints on the eos .",
    "interestingly , the universal relation between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is not restricted to slowly rotating models , but can be found also in stellar models that are spinning near the mass - shedding limit . in this case , the universal relation needs to be parameterized in terms of the dimensionless angular momentum , but the functional behaviour is very close to the nonrotating limit also at the most extreme rotation rates .",
