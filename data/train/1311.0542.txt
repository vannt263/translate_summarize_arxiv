    "before proving theorem 2 , we shall introduce the concept of two dimensional wavelet transform .",
    "first , let the unknown solution @xmath22 to eq.(1.1 ) be a two dimensional signal , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are displacement - coordinate and time - coordinate respectively .",
    "one can use the functions which have short support or rapid reduction ones to detect the locations of singular points of the solution @xmath12 . for convenience , we take gaussian distribution function @xmath25 since @xmath12 can be understood as a two - dimensional signal",
    ", it would be necessary to employ the two - dimensional wavelet transform .",
    "that means one should extend one - dimensional gaussian distribution function to two - dimensional gaussian distribution function as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a scale parameter .",
    "then denote @xmath28 as a function generated by @xmath29 with two - dimensional displacement , @xmath30 apply the convolution integral to @xmath12 and @xmath28 , @xmath31    let @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the smooth operator can be expressed by @xmath35 then , the convolution integral in eq.(2.4 ) can be represented by @xmath36 the muti - scale differential operator of the wavelet transform can be expressed by @xmath37    in this paper , the first and second derivatives are sufficient to deal with the problem .",
    "hence , we ignore the higher derivatives .",
    "let @xmath38 where @xmath39 .    denote @xmath40 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\varpsi_{\\sigma;b_1,b_2}(x , t)\\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath41",
    ".    without the influence of the noise ( wavelet transform is often influenced by noise at small scale and may produce false extreme points ) , the corresponding relationship between the local maxima or zeros of the wavelet transform modulus and singularity for @xmath12 ( signal ) is very accurate .",
    "the smaller the scale parameter @xmath27 is , the more accurate the corresponding relationship will be . usually , we choose @xmath42 [ 6 ] the details will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "the proof of theorem 2 can be divided into 2 cases  curve @xmath0 does intersect with @xmath23-axis and does not intersect with @xmath23-axis .    without loss of generality , select a small neighborhood of discontinuous point @xmath43 .",
    "if the curve @xmath0 intersects with @xmath23-axis at point @xmath44 , then we can consider @xmath45 and get the modulus by using one - dimensional wavelet transform @xmath46 where @xmath47 is modulus .    since @xmath48 is discontinuous at @xmath49 , then by wtmm , at @xmath50",
    ", @xmath51 is maximum modulus in the small neighorhood of @xmath52 .",
    "figure 2 gives an example of 1d wtmm which may present a visualized way to help reader understand it well .",
    "here s the process of wtmm for 1d signal . *",
    "a ) * is the signal with jump discontinuities at @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; * b ) * discontinuities are smoothed when convoluted with @xmath55 ; * c ) * discontinuities are local maxima when convoluted with @xmath56 ; * d ) * discontinuities are zeros when convoluted with @xmath57.,width=264,height=188 ]    finally , apply dalembert formula , it is clear that the modulus maximum will spread along the characteristics : @xmath58 .    if the curve @xmath0 has no intersection with @xmath23-axis , then we pick an arbitrary point @xmath59 . by hypothesis , the solution @xmath60 has second derivative jump discontinuity ( shock ) . for the two - dimensional wtmm , inspired by canny s [ 4 ] edge detector , mallat and hwang [ 6 ] showed that the components of the wavelet transform are proportional to the coordinates of the gradient vector of @xmath12 smoothed by @xmath61 ;",
    "in other word , @xmath62 wt_{t}u(\\sigma;b_1,b_2)\\end{array } \\right ) = \\sigma\\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(p_{\\sigma}\\varpsi*u)\\\\[0.1 in ] \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(p_{\\sigma}\\varpsi*u)\\end{array } \\right ) = \\sigma \\nabla ( p_{\\sigma}\\varpsi*u).\\ ] ] canny [ 3 ] pointed out that the edge points where the modulus of the gradient vector of @xmath63 is maximum in the direction where the gradient vector points too .",
    "the orientation of the gradient vector indicates the direction where partial derivative of @xmath12 has an absolute value which is maximum .",
    "mallat and hwang [ 6 ] showed that eq.(2.14 ) implies an angle between the horizontal and gradient vector , that is @xmath64 furthermore , the locally modulus maximum of @xmath12 is along the gradient direction with the angle @xmath65 if @xmath42 .    in our proof",
    ", for @xmath66 , let @xmath67 represent the partial derivative of @xmath66 along @xmath0 respect to @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the modulus maximum operator of two - dimensional wtmm .",
    "consider a small neighborhood of point @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 is modulus maximum in the small neigborhood of @xmath52 .",
    "then , when @xmath71 , the partial derivative of @xmath72 respect to @xmath24 is @xmath73 similarly , at @xmath71 , we have @xmath74 is modulus maxima in the small neigborhood of @xmath52 . and @xmath75    note that direction of wtmm is same with the gradiant vector , and @xmath23 is a function of @xmath24 .",
    "without loss of generality , we may assume @xmath76 .",
    "since there exists wtmm at @xmath71 , we have @xmath77 consider the derivatives respect to @xmath24 along the curve @xmath0 .",
    "( this direction is the wtmm orientation , since @xmath23 is a function of @xmath24 ) .",
    "then we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it implies the following systems , @xmath80 in words , as @xmath81 , the wavelet transform values of @xmath67 and @xmath82 on @xmath13 and @xmath14 are approaching to the values at @xmath71 on @xmath0 .",
    "next , use the convolution integral and wavelet transform on each side of eq.(1.5 ) , we have @xmath83 by eq.(3.10)-(3.11 ) , we have @xmath84 eq.(3.12 ) has nonzero solution , for the direction of derivatives of @xmath85 and @xmath86 respect to @xmath24 may not be always along @xmath0 .",
    "thus , determinant of eq.(3.12 ) is equal to zero . by the arbitrary of @xmath87",
    ", we have @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore , one can also show that for the equation @xmath90 the weakly discontinuity will also spread along the characteristics .    according to the above discussion",
    ", we have a conclusion for one - dimensional homogeneous hyperbolic pde with cauchy problem under the conditions mentioned in section 1 , that is    suppose there exists a weakly discontinuous curve @xmath91 on the solutions , then the orientation of two - dimensional wavelet transform modulus maxima are along the characteristics .    from the proof of theorem 2",
    ", we can see that wavelet transform modulus maxima appear on the weakly discontinuities .",
    "apply theorem 1 , discontinuous solutions are spreading along the characteristics .",
    "that means wavelet transform modulus maxima are along the characteristics .",
    "we can not assure at all the points where signal changes rapidly are the discontinuities .",
    "so it is necessary to distinguish them by using lipshitz index .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 intersects with @xmath23-axis at point @xmath49 , the discontinuous points on @xmath0 are jump discontinuity ( shock ) , @xmath92 approximate @xmath93 at point @xmath49 by a step function , then in a small neighborhood of discontinuous point @xmath49 , we have @xmath94 lipschitz index @xmath95",
    ".    then , for @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 since the derivative of @xmath98 is a dirac function , by ( 3.3 ) , we have @xmath99 lipschitz index @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the solution of @xmath12 at the discontinuous point @xmath49 will appear `` shock '' which is quite different from other point in the neighborhood . and",
    "the solutions on the characteristics also have the same feature .",
    "moreover , coefficients of wavelet transform in the interval section @xmath101 $ ] satisfy [ 6 ] @xmath102 when @xmath103 , maxima of wavelet transform modulus decreases with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "hence , small scale parameter can avoid the confusion of the images of singularity and point which has rapid change .    if @xmath0 does not intersect with @xmath23-axis , one should consider two - dimensional signal .",
    "the details about the two - dimensional wtmm lipschitz index can be found in [ 6 ] .",
    "an approach to prove theorem 2 by using wtmm is given in this paper .",
    "the main idea is to use convolution to smooth the solution containing weakly discontinuous points , and change the problem into finding the modulus maxima .",
    "the orientation of wtmm is also given in proposition 3 .",
