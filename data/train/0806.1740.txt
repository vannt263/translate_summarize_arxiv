    "gravitational instabilities can activate in a disk when the toomre ( 1964 ) parameter @xmath2 for a thick disk ( see durisen et al .",
    "2007 ) , where @xmath3 is the sound speed , @xmath4 is the surface density , and @xmath5 is the epicyclic frequency . as indicated by @xmath6 ,",
    "a disk is unstable against gis when it is cold and/or massive .",
    "the resulting spiral waves driven by self - gravity efficiently transfer angular momentum outward and mass inward ( e.g. , lynden - bell & kalnajs 1972 ; durisen et al .",
    "another mechanism that can efficiently transfer angular momentum outward is the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; see balbus & hawley 1991 ; desch 2004 ) .",
    "in contrast to gis , the mri only requires a weak magnetic field coupled to the gas .",
    "these mechanisms , either separately or in combination , are likely to be the principal way t tauri stars accrete gas from a disk ( hartmann et al .  2006 ) .    in order for the mri to occur",
    ", ionized species must be present in the gas phase .",
    "thermal ionization of alkalis occurs wherever @xmath7 k , but depletion of ions by dust grains may move the temperature threshold closer to @xmath8 k ( desch 1999 ; sano et al .",
    "2000 ) , where the dust sublimates completely .",
    "elsewhere , the ionization must be driven by a nonthermal source , e.g. , energetic particles ( eps ) . for this discussion ,",
    "eps refers to any particles that could ionize the gas , e.g. , x - rays .",
    "gammie ( 1996 ) proposed that disks may have active and inactive mri layers due to attenuation of eps by the gas . in the inner regions of a disk ( at radii @xmath9 few au ) where the column densities are large",
    ", mri may only be active in a thin layer , resulting in _",
    "layered accretion_. as one moves outward , column densities drop , and the entire disk can become mri active .",
    "the region where the mri is mostly absent is called the _",
    "dead zone_. eps are attenuated by a surface density of only about 100 g @xmath10 ( stepinski 1992 ) , and so even a minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) will likely exhibit layered accretion ( desch 2004 ) . even if mass accretion is only reduced and not altogether halted as a result of reynolds stresses ( fleming & stone 2003 ; oishi et al .  2007 )",
    ", mass may still pile up in the dead zone .",
    "if enough mass accumulates , then even for an otherwise low - mass disk , gis can activate .",
    "the fu orionis phenomenon is characterized by a rapid ( 1 - 10s yr ) increase in optical brightness of a young t tauri object , typically by 5 magnitudes , and is driven by sudden mass accretion of the order @xmath11 from the inner disk onto the star ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) . because fu ori objects appear to have decay timescales of about 100 yr , the entire mass of a mmsn ( @xmath12 ) can be accreted onto the star . to date , the best explanation for the optical outburst is a thermal instability ( e.g. , bell & lin 1994 ; kley & lin 1999 ; see discussions in hartmann & kenyon 1996 , green et al .",
    "2006 ; and zhu et al .",
    "armitage et al .  ( 2001 ) suggested that gis in a bursting dead zone might be able to trigger an fu ori outburst by rapidly increasing the accretion into the inner disk ( @xmath13 au ) and initiating an mri through thermal ionization .",
    "hartmann ( 2007 , in private communication ) and zhu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also suggest that the heating due to gravitational torques might drive an mri for @xmath14 au , which would then feed mass inside 0.1 au until a thermal instability sets in",
    ". the fu ori phenomenon may be a result of a _ cascade _ of instabilities , starting with a burst of gi activity in a dead zone , followed by accretion due to an mri , followed finally by a thermal instability ( cf kley & lin 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , recent observations of fu ori indicate that very large mass fluxes are present out to at least @xmath15 au ( zhu et al .",
    "2007 ) .    although details are still being debated , most chondrules formed in the first 1 to 3 myr of the solar nebula s evolution ( bizzarro et al .  2004 ; russell et al .",
    "chondrule precursors were flash melted from solidus to liquidus , where high temperatures @xmath8 k were experienced by the precursors for a few minutes .",
    "the melts then cooled over hours , with the actual cooling time depending on chondrule type .",
    "chondrule collisional histories and isotopic fractionation data , chondrule - matrix complementarity , fine - grained rim accumulation , and petrological and parent body location arguments ( krot et al .",
    "2005 ) suggest that chondrules formed in the solar nebula ( wood 1963 ) in strong , localized , repeatable heating events .",
    "the shock wave model for chondrule formation can accommodate these observational constraints and reproduce heating and cooling rates required to form chondrule textures ( iida et al .",
    "2001 ; desch & connolly 2002 ; cielsa & hood 2002 ; miura & nakamoto 2006 ) .",
    "one plausible source of chondrule - producing shocks is a global spiral wave ( wood 1996 ) .",
    "harker & desch ( 2002 ) suggest that spiral waves could also explain thermal processing at distances as large as 10 au , which may be necessary to explain observations of comets ( wooden et al .",
    "2005 ) and recent _ stardust _ results ( e.g. , mckeegan et al .",
    "it has been suggested that bursts of gis may be able to produce the required shock strengths ( boss & durisen 2005 ) and provide a source of turbulence and mixing ( boss 2004b ; boley et al .",
    "global spiral shocks are appealing because they fit many of the constraints above .",
    "they may be repeatable , depending on the formation mechanism for the spiral waves ; they are global , but produce fairly local heating ; they can form chondrules in the disk ; and they can work in the inner disk as well as the outer disk .",
    "knowing under what conditions protoplanetary disks can fragment is crucial to understanding disk evolution inasmuch as a fragmented disk may produce gravitationally bound clumps .",
    "this has become known as the _ disk instability _",
    "hypothesis for the formation of gas giant planets ( kuiper 1951 ; cameron 1978 ; boss 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the strength of gis is regulated by the cooling rate in disks ( tomley et al .",
    "1991 , 1994 ; pickett et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 , 2003 ) , and if the cooling rate is high enough in a low-@xmath6 disk , a disk can fragment ( gammie 2001 ) .",
    "gammie quantified that a disk will fragment when @xmath16 for a disk with a @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the two - dimensional adiabatic index , such that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the gas pressure and @xmath21 is the vertical direction in the disk . here",
    ", @xmath22 is the local cooling time and @xmath23 is the angular speed of the gas .",
    "this criterion was approximately confirmed in 3d disk simulations by rice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and meja et al .",
    "rice et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed through 3d disk simulations that this fragmentation criterion depends on the 3d adiabatic index @xmath24 and , for @xmath25 or 7/5 , the fragmentation limit occurs when @xmath26 or 12 , respectively .",
    "these results show that a change by a factor of about 1.2 in @xmath27 has a factor of two effect on the critical cooling time .",
    "in addition , these results indicate that the cooling time must be roughly equal to the dynamical time of the gas for the disk to be unstable against fragmentation when @xmath28",
    ".    do such prodigious cooling rates occur in disks when realistic opacities are used with self - consistent radiation physics ?",
    "this question is heavily debated in the literature ( e.g. , nelson et al .",
    "2000 ; boss 2001 , 2004a , 2005 ; rafikov 2005 , 2007 ; boley et al .",
    "2006 , 2007b ; mayer et al .  2007 ; stamatellos & whitworth 2008 ) .",
    "the simulations to date use a wide variety of numerical methods , including very different approximations for radiation physics , and only two groups have published results of radiative transfer tests appropriate for disks ( boley et al .  2007b ; stamatellos & whitworth 2008 ) .    nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used 2d sph simulations with radiation physics to study protoplanetary disk evolution .",
    "because their simulations were evolved in 2d , they assumed that the disk at any given moment was in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium . using a polytropic vertical density structure and pollack et al .",
    "( 1994 ) opacities , they cooled each particle according to an appropriate effective temperature . in their simulations ,",
    "the cooling rates are too low for fragmentation .",
    "in contrast , boss ( 2001 , 2005 ) employed radiative diffusion in his 3d grid - based code ; fragmentation occurs in his simulated disks .",
    "besides the difference in dimensionality of the simulations , boss assumed a fixed temperature structure for rosseland mean optical depths less than 10 , as measured along the radial coordinate ( cf recent flux - limited simulations by boss 2008 ) .",
    "boss ( 2002 ) found that the fragmentation in his disks is insensitive to the metallicity of the gas and attributed this independence to fast cooling by convection ( boss 2004a ) .",
    "however , it must be noted that nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) assumed a vertically polytropic density structure . because the specific entropy @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the polytropic equation of state and @xmath31 is the gas density , the nelson et al .",

    "( 2006 ) , boley et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007b ) , and stamatellos & whitworth ( 2008 ) find long cooling rates and no efficient cooling by convection .",
    "cai et al .",
    "also show that the strength of gis is dependent on the metallicity .",
    "furthermore , boley & durisen ( 2006 ) suggest that shock bores , which can cause a rapid vertical expansion in the post - shock region of spiral shocks , could be misidentified as `` convective '' flows . in both contrast and support of these studies , mayer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) use sph simulations with 3d flux - limited diffusion and find that fragmentation only occurs once the mean molecular weight of the gas @xmath32 .",
    "however , the simulations presented by meja ( 2004 ) , cai et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and boley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) unintentionally were evolved with @xmath33 due to an error in the inclusion of he in the opacity tables , and their disks do not fragment .",
    "the issue of fragmentation in radiatively cooled disks thus remains unsettled .      for this study",
    ", we adopt the hypothesis , which we refer to as the _ unified theory _ , that bursts of gi activity in dead zones drive the fu ori phenomenon and produce chondrule - forming shocks .",
    "this hypothesis is an amalgamation of ideas presented in wood ( 1996 , 2005 ) , gammie ( 1996 ) , armitage et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and boss & durisen ( 2005 ) . in order to investigate this scenario",
    ", we designed a numerical experiment to evolve a massive , highly unstable disk with an initial radial extent between 2 and 10 au .",
    "commensurately , we investigate the stability of these massive , gravitationally unstable disks against fragmentation to assess the feasibility of the disk instability hypothesis for gas giant formation .",
    "the shock speed @xmath34 for a fluid element entering a global , logarithmic spiral wave with pitch angle @xmath35 is approximately described by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the corotation radius of the spiral pattern and where we have assumed that the gas azimuthal motion is keplerian and @xmath38 is negligible .",
    "when @xmath39 , the shock speed limits to the keplerian speed times @xmath40 ; whether spiral waves with large @xmath37 produce chondrules is mainly dependent on the pitch angle of the spiral wave .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath41 , the speed increases as @xmath42 , and even shallow pitch angles can produce chondrules .",
    "for example , consider the mmsn , where the midplane @xmath43 g @xmath44 ( hayashi et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath34-@xmath31 plane with heavy , solid curves indicating shock speeds for @xmath45 , 2.5 , 5 , and @xmath46 au and with @xmath47 and 30@xmath48 .",
    "the colored regions on the plot highlight where chondrule formation is expected in a mmsn ( yellow ) and a 10@xmath49mmsm ( orange ) .",
    "the chondrule - forming curves are based on the results of desch & connolly ( 2002 ) , which we summarize by @xmath50 .",
    "the boundaries set by these curves are meant to be illustrative , not definitive .",
    "spiral shocks along shallow pitch angle spiral waves ( @xmath51 ) are mostly if not entirely out of the chondrule - forming range between @xmath52 and 5 au for shocks inside corotation .",
    "however , spirals with corotation in the inner disk can produce chondrule - forming shocks for a wide range of radii , depending on the actual @xmath37 .",
    "if the spiral waves have very open pitch angles ( @xmath53 ) , then spiral waves with corotation near @xmath54 au can produce chondrule - forming shocks near the asteroid belt and at cometary distances . the mass of the disk does not change these general behaviors .",
    "a major caveat for this simple - minded approach is that the fluid elements motions may be poorly described by equation ( 1 ) if vertical and radial excursions induced by shock bores ( boley & durisen 2006 ) can not be neglected .",
    "the possibility of producing chondrules in the asteroid belt and at comet distances during the same burst is attractive .",
    "moreover , we would also like to use these simulations to study other phenomena such as radiation transport , convection , and disk fragmentation in the 2 - 10 au region .",
    "for these reasons , we tried to design a numerical experiment to investigate the connection between gis , fu orionis events , and chondrule formation that is biased toward producing strong shocks with a corotation near 5 au and with open pitch angles .",
    "if chondrule - producing shocks can not be created in simulations biased in their favor , then it would present a serious problem for gis as the source of chondrule processing .",
    "the reader should keep in mind that the model , at this stage , is not necessarily meant to be representative of a typical disk , although the massive disk we present may be plausible for early class i objects ( e.g. , l1551 ; osorio et al .",
    "2003 ) . to create the initial conditions ( ics ) , consider a disk that is vertically polytropic , is axisymmetric , has a constant @xmath27 , and is keplerian ( @xmath55 ) . also assume that self - gravity is negligible . with these assumptions ,",

    "the critical surface density power law is then @xmath66 for @xmath28 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath69 , radial thermal convection may set in for a constant @xmath6 disk .",
    "however , the radial entropy gradient is not the only stability criterion for radial thermal convection in disks ( klahr & bodenheimer 2003 ) .",
    "equations ( 2 ) through ( 5 ) are used to generate the ics for this study .",
    "the disk is massive , @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , initially between about 2 and 10 au in radius and with a @xmath72 everywhere .",
    "although the surface density power law is steep , it is consistent with the nice - mmsn ( desch 2007 ) .",
    "because the analytic model ignores self - gravity , assumes a constant @xmath27 ( see  3.2 below ) , and has sharp disk truncation edges , the model must be relaxed to a new equilibrium structure in the hydro code . once the ics are generated ,",
    "they are loaded into our code and evolved without cooling at very low azimuthal resolution , essentially two - dimensionally .",
    "the radial and vertical momenta are damped to allow the disk to relax calmly to an equilibrium configuration , which takes about ten orbits at 10 au . to create a mass concentration in the disk , mass",
    "is then added to the disk linearly in time with a gaussian profile .",
    "the specific internal energy is held constant .",
    "the peak of the gaussian is centered on 5 au .",
    "the radial fwhm of the gaussian is chosen to be 3 au , which is roughly the size of the most unstable radial wavelength @xmath73 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "mass is added until nonaxisymmetry is visible in midplane density images , which takes approximately 190 yr , i.e. , 6 orp of evolution ( 1 orp is defined as 1 outer rotation period at 10 au for this model , which is about 33 yr ) . the total mass added is about 0.08 @xmath74 , and so if one were to imagine a corresponding accretion rate , it would be about @xmath75 yr@xmath76 . it is probably unphysical to add so much mass so quickly to the disk without increasing the temperature",
    "however , we remind the reader that the study is a numerical experiment .",
    "figures 2 and 3 illustrate the density distributions of the disk before and after the mass accretion .",
    "the mass buildup increases the total mass of the simulated disk to @xmath77 m@xmath78 and it decreases @xmath6 below unity in a narrow region around 5 au just before strong gi activation . because the ring is grown over 6 orp , the instability is not obviously overshot .",
    "the mass - weighted average @xmath79 over the fwhm of the gaussian centered at 5 au is approximately unity when the ring becomes unstable .",
    "this implies that @xmath6 must approach unity for a spatial range of at least the most unstable radial wavelength before gis will activate in a disk .      the disk is evolved with the chymera code ( boley 2007 ) , which employs the boley et al .",
    "( 2007b ) radiation physics algorithm .",
    "chymera is an eulerian code that solves the hydrodynamics equations on a fixed , cylindrical grid .",

    "the hydrodynamics scheme in chymera is eulerian , and does not give direct information on the histories of tracer fluid elements . in order to derive detailed and statistical shock information and to capture the complex gas motions in unstable disk simulations ,",

    "velocities and thermodynamic quantities , e.g. , temperature and density , are interpolated once each time step . because the hydrodynamics code explicitly solves the equation of motion for the gas , the algorithm only needs time and velocity information to integrate the positions of the fluid elements .",
    "the runge - kutta integrator was intended to be fourth - order accurate ; unfortunately , an implementation error when combining the integration scheme into chymera resulted in a first - order accurate scheme in time . because tracing fluid element histories is an important point of this paper ,",

    "the sample deviations indicate that the variations between the the two schemes are also marginal for the radial and azimuthal directions . there is considerably larger scatter in the vertical direction , where spiral shocks can create complicated vertical flows ( boley & durisen 2006 ) .",
    "because the fluid elements are used to gather shock information , the scatter in the vertical positions between the two schemes is not a major concern for this study .",
    "the effect is similar to redistributing the fluid elements vertically , keeping the same @xmath42 and @xmath106 , every few orbits .",
    "an akima spline is similar to a natural cubic spline , but typically yields better results for curves with sudden changes ( see akima 1970 ) , as are expected in shock profiles .",
    "although the spline fits a curve to a one - dimensional set of data points , the interpolation can be extended to data in three dimensions .",
    "first , consider a cubic volume with data at the vertices .",
    "a value anywhere in the volume can be approximated by seven linear interpolations : four to calculate values between each vertex in a particular direction , two to calculate the values along the projections of the desired point onto the interpolated lines , and a final interpolation through the point of interest .",
    "extending this from a simple tri - linear fit to a tri - akima spline is relatively straightforward . instead of using the eight nearest points that enclose a volume",
    ", one uses the 125 closest points , with five data points used for every akima spline fit .",
    "the central data point is the closest data value to the point of interest .",
    "we use the gnu scientific library akima spline algorithm for performing fits .",

    "the images at @xmath116 yr indicate that except for the @xmath98 simulation , the burst has a well - defined , three - arm spiral and that the spiral arms become denser as the opacity is lowered . by 77 yr , the disk structures are noticeably different .",

    "the lower opacity simulations appear to have stronger amplitudes , with denser spiral arms and stronger mid - order fourier components ( see below ) . as will be discussed , the @xmath95 @xmath5 simulation is on the verge of fragmentation .",

    "the @xmath97 simulation is not shown for readability , but if falls between the @xmath93 and @xmath98 simulations and has the least amount of divergence between the 512 and 1024 simulations at large @xmath84 .",
    "for all runs , the fourier @xmath123 through 6 dominate , and the power in the @xmath124 spectra drops off steeply around @xmath125 .",

    "the energetics of the disk simulations are shown in figures 9 and 10 , where cumulative energy loss by radiation ( blue ) and cumulative energy dissipation by shocks ( red ) are plotted .",
    "these quantities are integrated during the evolution , so they represent the actual heating and cooling in these disks . for both resolutions of the standard case",
    ", the shock heating clearly dominates over the cooling ; the disk is heating up over the entire evolution .",
    "energy is transported inefficiently for the highly optically thick disk , and the disk evolves like an adiabatic simulation . when the opacity is reduced by a factor of 100 , the cooling becomes much more important than it is in the standard simulation , with radiative energy losses becoming comparable to heating by shocks .",
    "in addition , the shock heating rate becomes somewhat larger during the burst .",
    "the 1024 standard and @xmath93 @xmath5 show additional heating .",
    "this heating is quite strong in the 1024 standard simulation , and it must be stopped even earlier than the 512 standard due to high temperatures , as discussed above .",
    "the 1024 @xmath93 @xmath5 is very similar to its 512 counterpart .",
    "there is additional heating and cooling during the burst , but the heating and cooling curves for both resolutions roughly track each other .",
    "the adiabatic curve , which is only shown to 33 yr ( 1 orp ) , is difficult to see because it tracks the standard cases extremely closely .",
    "when the opacity is reduced by a factor of @xmath127 , the radiative cooling is even more efficient and surpasses shock heating .",
    "the @xmath128 opacity reduction shows the strongest shock heating and the fastest disk cooling .",
    "the 1024 @xmath95 @xmath5 simulation curves track the 512 curves , with the burst contributing the most to the offset of the curves .",
    "unlike the higher opacity simulations , for @xmath98 , there is less shock heating and less total cooling at higher resolution .",
    "the 1024 @xmath94 @xmath5 simulation roughly tracks the 512 counterpart , with the strongest deviation near 66 yr ( 2 orp ) .",
    "the adiabatic curve is shown again as a reference .",
    "as one would expect from analytic arguments , the opacity has a profound effect on disk cooling and , consequently , on spiral shocks .",
    "the effect of opacity on energy losses is also demonstrated in figures 11 and 12 . in these figures ,",
    "brightness temperature maps for the 1024 simulations are shown for similar times as in figure 6 , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 is vertical outward intensity as calculated by the ray solution in chymera .",
    "in addition , we define a cooling temperature @xmath131dz/\\sigma)^{1/4}$ ] , which is the temperature that corresponds to a given column s effective flux if all of the energy were to leave the column vertically .",
    "if the column is being heated , @xmath132 is set to zero and appears as black in the images .",
    "as the opacity is lowered , the spiral structure becomes more clearly outlined , and the disk becomes brighter because the photons can leave from hotter regions .",
    "the brightness maps also demonstrate that sustained fast cooling by convection is absent . if hot gas near an optically thick midplane is quickly transported to altitudes where @xmath101 , convection can , in principle , enhance disk cooling . however , the efficacy of convective cooling is controlled by the rate at which that energy can be radiated from the photosphere of the disk .",
    "if localized convective flows were responsible for fast cooling in the optically thick disks , one would expect to find strong , localized @xmath133 and @xmath132 enhancements .",
    "for example , the standard and @xmath96 simulations would need to have regions as bright as the @xmath98 simulation .",
    "there are thin regions along the spiral shocks in the @xmath96 simulation that show large @xmath132 , but they do not correspond to enhancements in @xmath133 as well .",
    "this suggests that the energy from the spiral shocks is not transported efficiently to altitudes where it can be quickly lost from the disk .",
    "this assessment is supported by the net radiative heating in regions surrounding the strong shocks , e.g. , the black outlines ( areas experiencing net radiative heating ) around the thin , hot spiral waves . the corresponding energy flux that is needed for convection to be sustained and to cool the disk does not occur ( see also boley et al .  2006 , 2007b , nelson 2006 , & rafikov 2007 ) .    the importance of the opacity for disk cooling is also shown in figures 13 through 15 . on these plots ,",

    "regardless , it serves as a general indicator for disk fragmentaiton .    as figures 13 through 15 demonstrate ,",
    "the disk is approaching a state of constant @xmath6 for a wide range of radii , as expected in an asymptotic phase ( meja et al .",
    "the mass - weighted average @xmath6s between 3 and 6 au are given in table 1 and tend to decrease , as expected , when the opacity decreases .",
    "they do not seem to be greatly affected by resolution .",
    "the variation in the average @xmath6 with opacity is roughly consistent with the @xmath140 measurements .",
    "one should keep in mind that the @xmath6 profiles represent snapshots of the disk , while the @xmath140 measurements are time averages .",
    "the standard simulation is not shown in the stability plots , but the analysis of the 512 standard disk shows that it is highly stable against fragmentation .    because the cooling times fluctuate rapidly , we average the integrated cooling rates and the internal energies for the , roughly , 65- and 70/80-year snapshots .",
    "the cooling time profiles for the appropriate @xmath24 only drop substantially below unity over extended regions where @xmath6 is high ; these disks are stable against fragmentation .",
    "as the opacity is lowered , the cooling times decrease as well , with the @xmath95 @xmath5 simulation close to the fragmentation limit .",
    "it should also be noted that the only disk that behaves like a constant @xmath24 disk is the standard opacity simulation ( not shown ) , and for all other simulations , a constant @xmath24 is inappropriate ( see boley et al .",
    "2007a ) .",
    "mass in these disks is redistributed efficiently during the activation of gis .",
    "time - averaged mass fluxes are calculated by differencing the mass inside a cylinder at two different times .",

    "the inward and outward accretion rates vary , and in all simulations , can be well above @xmath141 yr@xmath76 ( fig .",
    "16 ) .",
    "due to our resolution , shocks are spread over scales of about @xmath142 cm or larger , whereas 1d calculations of chondrule - producing shocks give structures @xmath143 cm ( desch & connolly 2002 ) . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we measure the pressure difference between the pre- and post - shock regions to calculate the mach number @xmath144 . using the pressure and temperature histories for each fluid element ,",
    "a possible shock is identified whenever the @xmath145 changes from negative to positive then back to negative .",
    "the pre - shock flow is taken to be the first sign switch , and the post - shock flow is the second sign switch .",
    "let @xmath146 be the fractional pressure change , where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the pre- and post - shock pressures , respectively , and where @xmath27 is the average of the pre- and post - shock first adiabatic index .",
    "if @xmath149 , the event is counted as a shock .",
    "once @xmath144 is determined , the pre - shock velocity @xmath150 is calculated , where @xmath151 is the pre - shock adiabatic sound speed of the gas .",
    "the shock strengths are also derived using the ratio of the post - shock to pre - shock temperatures : @xmath152 .",
    "both approaches should give the same answer whenever the shocks are cleanly defined and adiabatic . however , if radiative cooling becomes very efficient , then assuming adiabatic shock conditions may be incorrect .",
    "furthermore , secondary waves or shocks ( boley & durisen 2006 ) may make identifying pre- and post - shcok regions very difficult .",
    "neither method is clearly favored , and both will only provide crude estimates .",
    "we estimate a shock to be chondrule - forming when @xmath34 lies in a 1 km s@xmath76 band between 5 km s@xmath76 and 11 km s@xmath76 and when the pre - shock density is between @xmath153 = -8.5 and -10.5 . this estimate is based on the desch & connolly ( 2002 ) 1d calculations , similar to the relation used to locate chondrule - producing shocks in figure 1 .",
    "chondrule - forming shocks should be thought of as having the potential to form chondrules , but may not yield chondritic material due to incompatible dust to gas ratios , too high or low cooling rates , and fractionation .",
    "table 2 indicates shock information as extracted from the pressure histories of the fluid elements . estimating shock strengths with the temperature ratio yields comparable numbers except for the chondrule - forming shocks ( see below ) .",
    "column two shows approximately the total number of detected shocks ( ts ) with @xmath154 , and column three displays the average number of shocks per fluid element .",
    "columns four ( ts mass ) and five ( cs mass ) show the total dust mass ( see below ) that goes through a shock with @xmath155 and the total dust mass that encounters a chondrule - forming shock , respectively . to estimate how much dust",
    "is processed in shocks , we assign each fluid element a mass by calculating the total disk mass within some @xmath156 and distributing that material evenly among all fluid elements in that @xmath156 .",
    "a gas to solids ratio of 100 is assumed everywhere for the dust processing calculations .",
    "although this is inconsistent with the growth and settling of solids assumed in six of the simulations , we do not worry about this detail inasmuch as the midplane will process more solids per shock and the high - altitude shocks will process less . finally , column six shows the total number ( total fe ) of fluid elements that remain after the 70 yr time period , i.e. , the elements that were not accreted onto the star or fluxed into background density regions .",
    "we check whether the total number of detected shocks is reasonable by evaluating the expected number of shocks in a keplerian disk with @xmath84-arm spiral waves .",
    "if the corotation radius for the pattern is @xmath37 , the number of shocks during some time period @xmath157 for a fluid element orbiting at @xmath42 is @xmath158 evaluating equation ( 6 ) for 1000 fluid elements evenly distributed in annuli between 2 and 8 au , with @xmath159 au , with @xmath160 , and with @xmath161 yr yields approximately 8000 shocks .",
    "so the number of detected shocks in these simulations is reasonable .",
    "the total number of shocks per fluid element are roughly consistent for each simulation except for the @xmath98 runs . the more flocculent spiral structure in these simulations not only produces a larger number of shocks in the disk , but also creates candidate chondrule - producing shocks for four fluid elements ; the 1024 @xmath97 simulation has one fluid element that experiences a possible chondrule - forming shock .",
    "several thousand @xmath162 of dust are pushed through shocks in each simulation , implying that almost all dust experiences a shock with @xmath154 .",
    "in addition , a few @xmath162 of dust experience chondrule - forming shocks in the @xmath98 runs .",
    "we remind the reader that these are only crude , order of magnitude estimates .",
    "when the temperature ratio is used , shocks with chondrule - forming strengths are _ undetected _ , but the total dust mass pushed through shocks remains the same to about one percent .",
    "in this section , we review the implications of the results of this study for disk fragmentation , the effects of opacity on disk cooling , the fu ori phenomenon , and chondrule formation . we remind the reader that the simulations presented here are meant to be a numerical experiment that explores the possible connection between chondrules , fu ori outbursts , and bursts of gi - activity .",
    "moreover , this experiment provides a systematic study of the effects of opacity on disk cooling , which complements the cai et al .",
    "( 2006 ) metallicity study and provides a test bed for disk fragmentation criteria .",
    "after the onset of the burst , none of the disks fragments , and only the 512 @xmath95 @xmath5 simulation shows dense knot formation during the peak of the burst ( 10 - 30 yr ) .",
    "these knots do not break from the spiral wave even in the 1024 simulation , and so clump formation does not seem to be missed due to poor resolution .",
    "one should also keep in mind that for these simulations , the disk is first relaxed to equilibrium with standard opacity and then the opacity is suddenly dropped by a factor of 10@xmath163 at @xmath164 . in effect , the dust settling is treated as instantaneous .",
    "knot formation may not occur in a disk with more realistic settling timescales . as discussed below , this is also a caveat for the chondrule formation results . on the other hand",
    ", it does suggest that disk fragmentation might occur inside 10 au under even more extreme , but perhaps unphysical , conditions than we have modeled .",
    "the stability of these disks against fragmentation is supported by figures 13 through 15 .",
    "the cooling rates for the standard and @xmath96 simulations are too low to cause disk fragmentation .",
    "the @xmath94 and @xmath98 simulations do have areas where @xmath165 , but the disks approach stability against gis in those regions ( @xmath166 ; durisen et al .",
    "2007 ) . as noted in  4.2",
    ", @xmath167 is not a strict instability criterion , but it does serve as an estimate for disk stability against fragmentation . for no simulation is @xmath168 well below unity where @xmath6 is also @xmath169 .    lowering the opacity increases the cooling rates .",
    "the @xmath95 @xmath5 simulations exhibit the most rapid cooling because the midplane optical depths are near unity , which results in the most efficient radiative cooling possible .",
    "_ changes in dust opacity have a profound effect on disk cooling_. although not modeled , if the opacity were to continue to drop such that the midplane optical depth becomes well below unity , cooling would once again become inefficient .",
    "in addition , supercooling of the high optical depth disks ( standard and @xmath96 ) by convection does not occur . based on our results",
    ", we believe that hydraulic jumps as a result of shock bores ( boley & durisen 2006 ) rather than convection are a better explanation for the upwellings around spiral arms reported by boss ( 2004a ) and mayer et al .  ( 2007 ) .",
    "these findings are consistent with analytic arguments by rafikov ( 2005 , 2007 ) , with numerical studies of disk fragmentation criteria by gammie ( 2001 ) , johnson & gammie ( 2003 ) , and rice et al .",

    "figure 15 suggests , although for a later time , that increasing the cooling rates by a factor of two would drop @xmath168 well below unity in low-@xmath6 regions .",
    "figure 17 confirms that the disk fragments with such enhanced cooling . however , we remind the reader that the @xmath98 simulation has the optimal optical depth for cooling ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "we can not imagine any physical process that could cause a factor of two enhancement in cooling .",
    "three clumps form , one for each spiral wave , between 4 and 5 au .",
    "the location of clump formation is consistent with the prediction by durisen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that a spiral wave is most susceptible to fragmentation near corotation .",

    "fluid elements approach peak temperatures of @xmath177 k in all simulations ( fig .",
    "it is not difficult to speculate that if a larger extent of the disk were modeled , the temperatures due to shocks would be large enough to ionize alkalis thermally and possibly sublimate dust ( 1400 - 1700 k ) .",
    "if such a condition is met , then an mri could activate and rapidly carry mass into the innermost regions of the disk . from these simulations",
    "it appears to be plausible , but by no means proven , that a burst of gi activity as far out as 4 au can drive mass into the inner regions of the disk and create strong temperature fluctuations , which may then be responsible for a thermal instablility .",
    "although we are simulating very massive disks , we note that such systems may exist during the class i yso phase .",
    "additional studies need to be conducted , preferably with a self - consistent buildup of a dead zone , to address the efficiency of this mechanism in low mass disks .",
    "there are at least three observable signatures for this mechanism .",
    "first , if a gi - bursting mass concentration at a few au ultimately results in an fu ori phenomenon , then one would expect to see an infrared precursor from the gi burst , with a rise time of approximately tens of years .",
    "second , one would also expect for a large abundance of molecular species , which would normally be frozen on dust grains , to be present in the gas phase during the infrared burst due to shock heating ( hartquist 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "third , approximately the first ten au of the disk should have large mass flows if the burst takes place near @xmath0 to 5 au .",
    "we speculate based on these results that if the burst were to take place at 1 au , then high outward mass fluxes should be observable out to a few au .",
    "each simulation shows that a large fraction of material goes through shocks with @xmath154 .",
    "although these shocks are weak , their abundant numbers may result in the processing of dust to some degree everywhere in the 2 - 10 au region .",

    "because @xmath187 in gravitationally unstable disks , the linear wkb analysis may be marginally applicable . equation ( 7 ) predicts that linear spiral waves in these disks should have pitch angles @xmath188 to 11@xmath48 for @xmath186 between 1 and 1/2 , respectively .",
    "it appears that this estimate for @xmath35 extends accurately to the nonlinear regime , a result we did not expect .",

    "these low opacity disks have relatively flocculent spiral morphologies , including kinks in spiral waves .",
    "the @xmath98 simulations are on the verge of fragmentation . when interpreting these results , it is important to remember that the opacities were lowered abruptly and in a quite unphysical way .",
    "in addition , these detections are based on the fractional pressure change @xmath189 .",
    "if the temperature change is used , no chondrule - producing shocks are detected .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to efficient radiative cooling , which may make the assumption of adiabatic shock conditions incorrect , and/or to confusion with additional waves induced by shock bores .",
    "for the rest of this section , we assume that the pressure difference is the reliable shock identifier in order to discuss the implications of detecting chondrule - forming shocks in these disks .",
    "a thermal and spatial history for a fluid element that experiences a possible chondrule - forming shock is shown in figure 19 .",
    "to estimate the occurrence of a chondrule - forming shock , we employ a generous @xmath34-@xmath31 criterion ( fig .",
    "we do not take into account the optical depth criterion of miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) on grounds that the large scale over which these shocks take place can allow for chondrules to equilibrate with their surroundings ( cuzzi & alexander 2006 ) .",
    "however , one should be aware that the optical depth criterion of miura & nakamoto will likely exclude all chondrule - producing shocks inside 4 au in the @xmath34-@xmath31 plane for these simulations .",
    "all candidate chondrule - forming shocks occur between @xmath190 and 5 au and at altitudes that are roughly less than a third of the gas scale height .",
    "because a large degree of settling is assumed , these shocks are located in regions that may be consistent with the dusty environments in which chondrules formed ( wood 1963 ; krot et al .  2005 ) .",
    "we estimate that @xmath191 of dust is processed through chondrule - forming shocks . because these shocks are limited to the onset of the gi burst , a few@xmath192 of dust",
    "would be processed in the @xmath95 @xmath5 disks if they went through about ten outbursts .",
    "if more outbursts take place than those that lead to an fu orionis event , then more chondritic material could be produced . in order to produce these shocks ,",
    "the disk was pushed toward fragmentation by suddenly dropping the opacity by a factor of @xmath128 .",
    "we conclude that for bursts of gis near 4 or 5 au to produce chondrules , the disk must be close to fragmentation .",
    "the hypothesis behind the work summarized here is that bursts of gi activity , dead zones , the fu ori phenomenon , and chondrule formation are linked .",
    "the general picture is that mass builds up in a dead zone due to layered accretion and that gis erupt once @xmath6 becomes low .",
    "this activation of the instability causes a sudden rise in the mass accretion rate that heats up the disk inside 1 au to temperatures that can sustain thermal ionization and an mri .",
    "the mri shortly thereafter activates the thermal instability ( bell & lin .",
    "1994 ; armitage et al .  2001 ; zhu et al .",
