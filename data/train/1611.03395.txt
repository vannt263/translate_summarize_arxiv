    "although we not always use them , or even are not aware that a given quantity can be presented in such , iterative way .    on the other hand it is well known that some markov processes can be presented in an iterative way . in particular processes connected with filtration problems ( corrections are here called innovation processes ) , or some processes appearing in analysis of queuing systems can be naturally presented in an iterative way .",
    "such markov processes not necessarily converge ( or more generally stabilize their behavior ) as the number of iteration tends to infinity .",
    "the behavior of such processes for large values of indices can be very complex and sometimes exceeds the scope of this monograph",
    ". we will not consider such general situations .",
    "instead we will concentrate on iterative procedures converging to nonrandom constants .",
    "the number of random phenomena that can described by such procedures is so large that not all of them will be analyzed here .",
    "we will concentrate here on :    * _ laws of large numbers ( lln ) and their connections to mathematical analysis and in particular to the theory of summability and the theory of orthogonal series , _ * _ some procedures of stochastic approximation , _ * _ some procedures of density estimation , _ * _ some procedures of identification . _",
    "the title refers to laws of large numbers and their applications in technology and statistics .",
    "typical applications of the laws of large numbers in technology or physics are applications in the theory of measurements",
    ". suppose that we are given a series of measurements of some quantity . then if some relatively mild conditions , under which the measurements were performed , are satisfied , the arithmetic means of the measured values can be considered as good approximations of the measured quantity .",
    "it is worth noticing that this approximation is getting better if the number of measurements is greater .",
    "typical application of lln in statistics are estimators . usually we observe , that the larger sample the estimator is based upon , the closer the value of an estimator is to the theoretical value of the parameter .",
    "this basic property is called consistency ( of an estimator ) .",
    "in fact the fact that lln can be applied is the base on which one states that the given estimator is strongly consistent or not .",
    "other rather typical applications of lln are the so called monte carlo methods and based on them simulations .",
    "monte carlo methods are used in numerical methods to estimate values of some difficult to find constants ( given by say hard to compute integrals ) and also in physics to estimate , hard to get directly , constants used in description of physical phenomena , mainly , but not necessarily , in statistical physics",
    ".    variations of lln are used in described above estimation theory , measurement theory , monte carlo methods or statistical physics are simple . in mostly cases",
    "one assumes that random variables used there are independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) .",
    "convergence problem then is very simple .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing that random variables in question satisfy lln are known and simple .",
    "they will be discussed in sections [ sspwl_iid ] and [ smpwl_iid ] of chapter [ simpwl ] .",
    "difficulties associated with say monte carlo methods lie elsewhere .",
    "namely they lie in defining estimator with good properties or finding such physical experiment that could be easily simulated and in which the estimated constant would appear .",
    "discussion of these problems would lead us too far from probability theory and would require separate book .",
    "reader interested in monte carlo methods or stochastic simulations we refer to monographs of r. zieliski @xcite and d. w. heermann @xcite .    to be consistent with the title we decided to present three applications of lln important in technology ( identification , density estimation ) or stochastic optimization ( stochastic approximation ) .",
    "these applications can be also considered as parts of mathematical statistics , less known and less obviously associated with lln .",
    "moreover we were able to indicate formal similarities in description and formulation of these problems and convergence problems appearing in lln .",
    "it turns out that methods developed in chapter [ zbiez ] , can be applied in chapter [ simpwl ] dedicated to laws of large numbers as well as in chapters [ aproksymacja ] , [ metody_jadrowe ] , [ identyf ] dedicated respectively to stochastic approximation , kernel methods of density estimation or identification methods . on the other hand",
    "each of the mentioned applications contains dozens of cases .",
    "each of these applications is extensively described in the literature .",
    "thus it is impossible to present it exhaustively . on",
    "should write the separate volumes to make such presentation . besides it is not the aim of this book .",
    "as it was already stated above the aim of the author was to present problems connected with lln and indicate their connection with classical parts of mathematical analysis such as summation theory , convergence theory of orthogonal series .",
    "as it was mentioned before the aim of the author was relatively extensive presenting of problems associated with lln and indicate strong bounds with classical sections of mathematical analysis and at the same time indicate that laws of large numbers are the base for intensively developing sections of statistics such as stochastic optimization nonparametric estimation or adaptive identification .",
    "we are convinced that many statisticians working in stochastic optimization or nonparametric estimation are not aware how closely the are in their research to classical problems of analysis .",
    "similarly mathematicians working in the theory of summability or orthogonal series are not aware that their results can have practical applications .",
    "the author wanted to visualize those fact to both groups of researchers . to do this one",
    "must not mired in the details .",
    "basically the book was written for students of mathematics or physics or for the engineers applying mathematics .",
    "author assumes that the reader knows basic course of probability and elements of mathematical statistics .",
    "nevertheless some important notions and facts that are important for the logic of argument were recalled .",
    "the book is written as mathematical text that is facts are presented in the form of theorems .",
    "proofs of the majority of theorems are presented in the main bulk of the book .",
    "some of the proofs that are less important or are longer are shifted to the appendix .",
    "the facts that came from more deep or more complicated theories are recalled without proofs .",
    "the aims of the book are different and depend on the reader .",
    "students are exposed here to interesting applications of mathematics that make them aware that many issues coming from different sections of mathematics can be treated by the same methods .",
    "the books makes mathematicians or statisticians to realize that the methods developed specially for one section of mathematics can be useful in the other .",
    "finally those readers that do not work in stochastic optimization or nonparametric estimation are acquainted with those sections of statistics    it should be underlined that neither of the topics raised in the book is not exhausted .",
    "what seems to be the book s advantage is that it presents unified approach to different , at first sight , applications .",
    "we use in fact the same basic theorems to prove convergence of some orthogonal series , procedures of stochastic approximation , iterative procedures of density estimation or iterative procedures of identification .",
    "another advantage of the book seem to be great number and variety of examples illustrated by drawings made basically by mathcad and mathematica .",
    "looking at these examples one can get an idea how effective are the discussed methods or how quick is the convergence in the described random phenomenon .",
    "instead of introduction we will present the most important random phenomena called sometimes _ pearls of probability _ _  _ ( see e.g. hoffman - jorgensen @xcite ) . by this we mean _ laws of large numbers _ ( lln ) , _ central limit theorem _ ( clt ) _ _  _ _ and _  law of iterated logarithm _",
    "( lil)_. _ in the sequel we will show that these phenomena can be presented in an iterative form so that problems appearing in their analysis lie naturally within the scope of this monograph .",
    "not all of these problem could be solved by the simple methods developed in this book .",
    "sometimes one should refer to more advanced means .",
    "mathematical problems appearing in analysis of these pearls of probability are connected mainly with convergence .",
    "the types of convergence considered in probability are recalled in appendix [ rzbiez ] .",
    "in the three subsequent sections we will present the three random phenomena mentioned above , point out analogies and differences between them and present some of the related open problems . as it will turn out that the forms of these phenomena are very similar . the differences concern properties of some of the parameters and the types of convergence that these phenomena obey .",
    "so first we will present these random phenomena and later we will return to general questions .",
    "let @xmath62 be a sequence of random variables having expectations .",
    "let us denote @xmath63    [ lln]we say that the sequence @xmath62 satisfies _ weak ( strong ) _ law of large numbers _ _  _ _ ( briefly wlln ( slln ) ) , _ if _ @xmath64 where convergence is either in probability ( for the wlln ) or with probability @xmath65 ( for the slln ) .    on considers",
    "also the so called generalized lln , that is sequences of random variables that are summable by the so called riesz method .",
    "more precisely we say that the sequence @xmath66 satisfies _ weak ( strong ) _ generalized law of large numbers ( briefly wglln , sglln ) with weights",
    "@xmath67 , if @xmath68 where , as before , convergence is in probability for the wglln and with probability @xmath65 for the sglln .",
    "we will return to this definition in section [ riesz ]    following intentions of this book we will present random sequence @xmath69 in a recursive ( iterative ) form . namely we have : @xmath70 , or equivalently in slightly different more general forms : @xmath71 where @xmath72 . in the sequel we will be interested in convergence of the sequence @xmath73 to zero , and also convergence of the series @xmath74 .",
    "the form ( [ forma1 ] ) will be more useful in examining convergence , while ( [ forma2 ] ) will be more useful in analyzing stochastic approximation procedures , since due to it one can easily noticed connections between stochastic approximation and laws of large numbers .    as the first example of application of the law of large numbers",
    "let us consider problem of measuring the unknown quantity @xmath75 . as the result of independent , and performed in the same conditions , measurements , we obtain observations : @xmath76 . we assume the following model of taking measurement : @xmath77 if one can assume that the sequence of measurements @xmath57 , @xmath78 satisfies slln , then the sequence of quantities @xmath79 converges almost surely to @xmath80 .",
    "hence the postulate to approximate the measured quantity by the mean of the measurements makes sense .    other more spectacular example of application of lln concerns estimating the number of fish in the pond .",
    "suppose that we would like to get information on the number of fish without emptying the pond which would inevitably kill the fish . to this end",
    "we release to the pond @xmath81 marked fish ( those can be fish of the other species ) .",
    "next we perform @xmath82 catches with return .",
    "each time we note if the caught fish was marked or not .",
    "let @xmath83 be the unknown number of fish in the pond .",

    "if one can assume that the sequence @xmath86 satisfies lln , then for sufficiently large @xmath82 we have approximate equality : @xmath87 now it is elementary to solve this equality for @xmath83 .",
    "[ identification][ident]in the last example let us consider the following time series ( i.e. solution of the following recursive equation ) : @xmath88 we assume that random variables @xmath89 form an i.i.d .",
    "( independent identically distributed ) sequence with zero expectations .",
    "let us suppose that we are given observations @xmath90 and using only them we would like to estimate the value of parameter @xmath3 . can one find a sequence of functions of these observations that would converge to @xmath3 ?",
    "it turns out that if one assumes that the sequences @xmath91 and @xmath92 satisfy strong law of large numbers and moreover that @xmath93 , then such a sequence is defined by the following formula : @xmath94 to be convinced let us notice that @xmath95 .",
    "moreover as it can be easily noticed , for every @xmath96 , @xmath97 is a function of @xmath98 for @xmath99 ( other words is @xmath100 measurable ) , hence @xmath101 .",
    "as a result we have @xmath102 with probability @xmath65 .",
    "the above mentioned examples underline how important is to be sure that a given sequence satisfies or not a version of lln .",
    "under what assumptions a given sequence of random variables @xmath90 satisfies a version of law of large numbers will be presented in detail in chapter [ simpwl ] .",
    "in this part we will present only one simulation illustrating the law of large numbers .",
    "it will illustrate the example [ ident ] .",
