    "we focus on pairs of initially quiescent solitons ( rather than moving ones ) , as the interaction effects are strongest in such a case .",
    "our analysis was performed for several combinations of stable asymmetric solutions , for all the three values of the spin considered here , @xmath13 .",
    "first , we examined the interaction between identical solitons separated by distance @xmath146 , namely : @xmath147 .",

    "@xcite ( not shown here ) .",
    "in particular , in this case the collisions maintain the symmetry between the two components , and do not lead to the appearance of any asymmetric final states .",
    "we have introduced a model of a 2d dual - core waveguide with the cq ( cubic - quintic ) nonlinearity inside each core and the linear coupling between them .",
    "families of fundamental ( @xmath3 ) and vortical solitons , with spins @xmath1 and @xmath2 , have been constructed , and their stability has been investigated .",
    "the model may be realized as a dual - core planar optical waveguide , or as a set of two tunnel - coupled parallel pancake - shaped traps for bec . in the former case ,",
    "the solitons are planar light bullets `` . in particular , vortex solitons may be interpreted as a new species of the bullets '' , _",
    "viz_. , spatiotemporal vortices .",
    "the main objective of the work was to study symmetry - breaking bifurcations of the 2d solitons , both fundamental and vortical ones . if the inter - core coupling constant , @xmath0 , is not too large , the bifurcation diagrams for the solitons of all the types form closed loops , which connect points of direct and reverse bifurcations .",
    "the stability of all the solutions was investigated via the calculation of the corresponding eigenvalues for infinitely small perturbations around the solitons .",
    "in particular , it was found that , at sufficiently small values of @xmath0 , the loop for the fundamental solitons ( @xmath3 ) includes two bistability regions , which may be of interest for potential applications , such as all - optical switching .",
    "this is also a new feature of the loop in comparison with its earlier studied counterpart in the 1d version of the model , which could feature a single bistability domain . at larger values of @xmath0 , both bistable regions vanish and the loop s shape becomes plainly convex . with the further increase of @xmath0 , the loop shrinks to zilch and disappears , leaving only stable symmetric solitons .",
    "the vortical solitons may be easily destabilized by azimuthal perturbations , but they also have stability regions , as long as the corresponding bifurcation loop keeps its double - concave shape .",
    "we have also developed a quasi - analytical approach to the description of the bifurcation diagrams , based on the variational approximation , which produces reasonably accurate predictions , in comparison with the numerical results .    in direct simulations",
    ", we have demonstrated the splitting of azimuthally unstable asymmetric solitons into sets of fragments .",
    "the number of the fragments usually corresponds to the azimuthal index of the most unstable eigenmode of small perturbations .",
    "we have also studied interactions between initially quiescent solitons , and confirmed the earlier prediction phase , which states that the usual attractive / repulsive sign of the interaction between the in - phase/@xmath156-out - of - phase solitons with even values of the spin ( @xmath3 or @xmath2 ) , is reversed for the odd spin ( @xmath1 ) . in the case of the attraction ,",
    "the vortex solitons merge into disordered patterns , losing the initial topological structure .",
    "this work may be naturally extended in other directions .",
    "in particular , it may be interesting to study symmetry - breaking effects in two - component 2d solitons and vortices in the system of nlses coupled by both linear and nonlinear terms , which may describe the co - propagation of two polarizations of light in a single nonlinear waveguide @xcite .",
    "moreover , the latter version of the model is meaningful in the 3d geometry too .",
    "another relevant generalization still pertains to the dual - core waveguide , with the linear coupling between the two waves , while the competing nonlinear terms are quadratic and cubic , rather than cubic and quintic , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in that case",
    ", one may also expect bifurcation loops accounting for the breaking and restoration of the symmetry of two - component solitons .",
