    "this paper presents a theoretical investigation of the three - photon decay rates from @xmath2 and @xmath3 states in the helium atom .",
    "the primary motivation for these calculations is the recent series of spectroscopic tests of bose - einstein statistics for the system of two photons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the experiments use a selection rule [ 2 , 3 ] for atomic transitions that is closely related to the landau - yang theorem ( lyt ) @xcite .",
    "the selection rule states that two equivalents photons can not participate in any process that would require them to be in a state with total angular momentum equal to one .",
    "an evident example in the high - energy physics is the prohibition of the two - photon decay for the neutral spin - one @xmath4-boson .",
    "the same concerns the annihilation decay of orthopositronium ( also spin-1 state ) .",
    "however both these decays are also forbidden by charge - parity conservation law .",
    "positronium presents a real neutral system ( it coincides with itself after charge conjugation ) , therefore it possesses a definite charge parity @xcite , connected with the total spin value @xmath5 : parapositronium ( @xmath6 ) is charge - positive and orthopositronium ( @xmath7 ) is charge negative .",
    "since the charge parity of a system of @xmath8 photons equals @xmath9 @xcite , parapositronium can not decay into an odd number of ( not necessarily equivalent ) photons and orthopositronium can not decay into an even number of photons .",
    "the @xmath10-boson as a charge - parity - negative particle can not decay into an even number of photons .",
    "recently lyt was employed for the proof that the heavy particle discovered at lhc @xcite has spin @xmath6 , i.e. presents higgs boson .",
    "a similar situation exists for atomic transitions .",
    "the early calculations of the two - photon decay of the singlet @xmath11 and triplet @xmath12 excited states of he and he - like ions to the ground @xmath13 state revealed the crucial difference in the photon frequency distributions in both cases @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the decay probability for the triplet case turns to zero when the frequencies of the emitted photons are equal .",
    "later these conclusions were confirmed within the fully relativistic calculations ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "a neutral atom unlike positronium is not a real neutral system and does not possess a definite charge parity .",
    "therefore the differencies in atomic transitions are exclusively due to the bose - einstein statistics .    in @xcite",
    "the spin - statistics selections rules ( sssrs ) for multiphoton transitions with equal photons in atomic systems were established which present an extension of lyt to the 3- and 4-photon systems .",
    "the sssr-1 sounds like : two equivalent photons can not participate in any atomic transition that would require them to have total ( common ) odd angular momentum .",
    "the sssr-2 is : three equivalent dipole photons can not participate in any atomic transition that would require the to have total even angular momentum .",
    "the sssr-3 claims that four equivalent dipole photons can not have total odd angular momentum .    for the experimental tests of sssrs it is possible to use laser source . unlike original lyt formulation ( this was mentioned both by landau @xcite and yang @xcite ) the derivation @xcite is valid also for the collinear i.e. for the laser photons . as particular examples the two- , three- and four - photon transitions in he - like u were considered in @xcite .",
    "this choice was explained , from the one side by the relative simplicity of the calculations in two - electron ions with the full neglect of the interelectron interaction .",
    "this neglect does not change the sssrs but makes the numerical results inaccurate .",
    "the inaccuracy drops down with increase of the nuclear charge and is minimal ( about 1% ) for u. from the other side the spectrum in two - electron atoms is reach enough to provide all interesting multiphoton transitions .",
    "however such atomic system as he - like uranium are not suitable for possible experimental tests of sssrs . for @xmath14 the energy difference between states @xmath2 , @xmath3 and ground state @xmath15 is of hundreds kev and prevents the use of optical lasers .",
    "an advantage of the use of the laser source is that all the photons will have the same frequency .",
    "if we divide the energy interval @xmath16 between appropriate atomic states by an integer number @xmath17 and adjust the laser frequency @xmath18 to this value , @xmath19 , the number of photons @xmath17 in the absorption process will be fixed .",
    "the value of the total angular momentum @xmath20 for @xmath21-photon system can be fixed by choosing the appropriate values @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the initial ( lower ) and final ( upper ) atomic levels in the transition process .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 the sssr-2 can be tested for @xmath27 which prohibits three dipole photons with the same parity and equal frequency to be in a quantum state with total angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "what we can not fix is the multipolarity of photon , i.e. a total angular momentum @xmath29 of every separate photon .",
    "a laser light in the beam can be decomposed in all possible multipolarities .",
    "this means , for example that together with e1e1e1 transition , all transitions with the same total parity constructed with the higher multipoles , i.e. e1m1e2 , e1e1m2 etc . will be always absorbed .",
    "however the processes with the photons of higher multipolarities are usually strongly suppressed in atoms , therefore the e1e1e1 transition will be dominant . measuring the absorption rate at the @xmath19 frequency one can establish the validity or non - validity of the particular sssr : the atomic vapour should be transparent for the laser light at the frequency @xmath19 .",
    "note also that unlike the spontaneous emission which is very weak for multiphoton transitions , the multiphoton absorption depends on the laser intensity and can be well observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "for the test of sssr-2 one can choose , in particular the transition @xmath30 with transition energy @xmath31 ev .",
    "this transition should obey the sssr-2 , i.e. three - photon absorption of the laser photons with equal frequencies should be absent .",
    "for comparison it is convenient to employ @xmath32 transition with the transition energy @xmath33 ev , which should not exhibit such properties since in this case three equal photons should have the total angular momentum @xmath34 .",
    "it is important that in both cases the initial @xmath35 state is metastable what enables to perform laser absorption experiments .",
    "the most advantageous for the experimental tests of sssrs is neutral helium atom where transitions correspond to the optical or infrared region .",
    "for example for the test of sssr-2 three - photon transitions between the @xmath35 state and excited @xmath2 and @xmath3 states can be used . unlike @xmath36 ion the calculations for neutral he atom can be performed with high accuracy .",
    "the application of sssrs to neutral he is the main purpose of the present paper .",
    "accurate variational calculations of the three - photon transitions are given , based on the employment of the variational wave functions . unlike the case of @xmath36 these calculations can be done with nonrelativistic wave functions ( overall accuracy of about 0.01% ) .",
    "a powerful method for obtaining the variational wave functions of hylleraas type developed in @xcite-@xcite was employed for these calculations .",
    "we have calculated @xmath37 , @xmath38,@xmath39 and @xmath40 three - photon transition rates .",
    "transitions from @xmath3 level exhibit the behaviour governed by sssr-2 and transitions from @xmath41 level were calculated for comparison .",
    "the three - photon decay of @xmath2 state is qualitatively different from @xmath3 three - photon decay since the sssr-2 plays significant role in @xmath42 transition .",
    "this difference affects both the angular and the energy distributions of three photons . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in he - like uranium @xmath42 transition rate turns to zero when the frequencies of three photons are equal while @xmath43 transition rate has the maximum in the same situation .",
    "this is also true for the neutral helium because the angular part remains the same .",
    "fully relativistic form of the differential transition rate in conjunction with the integration over photon directions @xmath44 and summation over the photon polarizations @xmath45 of all the photons with the account for all permutations of photons is @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the photon frequencies , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the photon angular momenta and their projections , @xmath50 , the indices @xmath51 represent the initial , intermediate and final atomic states respectively .",
    "summation over @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) extends over entire atomic spectrum .",

    "we have only to take into account the spin - orbit interaction for describing the intercombination transitions .    in the nonrelativistic limit ( @xmath65 ) with @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the dipole photons",
    "( [ 3 ] ) reduces to the form @xmath68 using definition for the spherical components of vector @xmath69 @xmath70 eq .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) yields @xmath72 in the @xmath73-electron atom @xmath74 , where @xmath75 are the spherical components of radius - vector for @xmath76-th electron .",
    "then the total transition rate can be defined as @xmath77 summation over all projections appearing in the expression ( [ 11 ] ) can be performed numerically for each value of corresponding angular momenta .    to perform the numerical calculations of three - photon transitions in two - electron atomic systems we use the variational wave functions of hylleraas type @xcite .",

    "these function are obtained by the variational method developed in @xcite-@xcite .",
