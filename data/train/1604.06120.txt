    "physical parameters of glaxy clusters , such as total mass and gas mass , are commonly studied through scaling relations .",
    "these relations assume that both growing and mature clusters are relaxed , self - similar systems such that relations between e.g. @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath2 , @xmath7 , etc .",
    "are simple power laws ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for a recent review ) . deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) ( or from virialisation ) and self - similarity during cluster mergers",
    "will cause scatter around the scaling relations .",
    "studies in the literature aim to use these relations to make accurate determinations of e.g. total cluster mass , and therefore often focus on minimising the scatter either by careful sample selection of low - redshift , relaxed clusters ( e.g. , , @xcite , @xcite ) , or by finding a particularly low - scatter mass proxy ( e.g. @xcite , , , @xcite ) .",
    "these approaches often produce low - scatter relations that agree with the self - similar predictions .",
    "however , @xcite , using simulations of two - body cluster mergers to track the evolution of a merger ( from a relaxed system before the start of the merger through to relaxation of the merged system ) in the plane of a scaling relation , find large changes in cluster observables _ along _ the relation with little perpendicular displacement .",
    "assessment of these cluster parameter values through calculation from sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz , @xcite ) and x - ray observation provides a critical probe of the dynamical state of the cluster gas due to the difference in dependencies of the sz and x - ray flux densities on the electron number density , @xmath0 .",
    "the sz effect is the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by hot cluster gas , and is @xmath12 , where @xmath7 is the plasma temperature and @xmath13 the line element along the line of sight through the cluster .",
    "the x - ray bremsstrahlung signal is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cooling function ( @xmath15@xmath16 @xmath17 for the clusters in this paper ) .",
    "parameter values estimated from measurement of sz and x - ray signals will , therefore , also depend differently on @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "as cluster mergers are known to produce regions of higher density gas , through processes such as shocking , x - ray parameter estimation is likely more sensitive to dynamical state , and will produce larger displacements along scaling relations during a merger than sz parameter values .",
    "this implies that merger activity can be identified by looking at discrepancies between sz and x - ray measurements .    to test this observationally ,",
    "we use the clash sample of well - studied clusters selected by @xcite to form a sample of massive clusters , most of which are classified in the literature as relaxed , plus a small number of clusters with pronounced strong gravitational lensing ( see section [ sec : sample ] ) . here",
    "we discuss measurements of a sub - sample of clash clusters via the sz effect using the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami , @xcite ) .",
    "the sz signal measures the comptonization parameter , @xmath18 , the line - of - sight integral of the number of collisions multiplied by the mean fractional energy change of the cmb photons per collision : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the thomson scattering cross - section , @xmath21 the electron mass , @xmath22 the speed of light .",
    "equation [ eq : ypar ] shows that the sz surface brightness is proportional to the electron pressure , @xmath23 , assuming an ideal gas law , integrated along the line of sight .",
    "integrating @xmath18 over the solid angle @xmath24 subtended by the cluster gives @xmath25 , which quantifies the internal energy of the cluster gas , providing a proxy for total mass , given redshift information .    in x - ray studies",
    "@xmath1 , found from @xmath26 , is used as an analogue of @xmath25 which is proportional to the product of the gas mass and the mean temperature measured from sz within a sphere ( or a cylinder ) .",
    "@xcite find , using simulated data , that @xmath1 provides an equally good proxy for total mass as @xmath25 .",
    "the mean cluster temperature has also been widely used as a proxy for total cluster mass .",
    "cluster @xmath7 has traditionally been measured through x - ray spectroscopy ; with good enough sensitivity and angular resolution , annular averaging gives temperature profiles out to , for some clusters , radii of @xmath271mpc ( see e.g. accept database , @xcite , @xcite , ) . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that a gas temperature profile can also be obtained via sz observation , given assumed geometry and dynamical state , and given a prior on the gas fraction @xmath28 at @xmath29 .    in this study ,",
    "cluster parameters are derived from our ami sz measurements in a fully bayesian way using the model described in @xcite and ( 2013 ) .",
    "this model uses a navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) profile to describe the dark matter density , which is believed , from cosmological n - body simulations , to accurately model all dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "a generalised navarro , frenk and white ( gnfw ) profile is used to describe the gas pressure , shown to follow self - similarity more closely than the density or temperature at high radius @xcite .",
    "further conditions of spherical symmetry , hse , and a small @xmath30 compared to unity , produces cluster properties as functions of radius .    throughout , we assume @xmath31 = 70  km  @xmath32 and a concordance @xmath15cdm cosmology with @xmath33 = 0.3 , @xmath34 = 0.7 , @xmath35 = 0 , @xmath36 = 0.041 , @xmath37 = @xmath381 , @xmath39 = 0 and @xmath40 = 0.8 .",
    "all cluster parameter values are at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "we emphasise that we denote @xmath41 as @xmath1 for either sz or x - ray .",
    "the clash ( cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ) sample consists of 25 massive clusters , covering a large redshift range ( @xmath42 from 0.213 to 0.888 ) , selected for strong and weak lensing observation with hubble and _ subaru _ @xcite . 20 of these clusters were selected from @xmath4 x - ray observations to be dynamically relaxed .",
    "the remaining five clusters were selected solely based on their high lensing - strength and consequently include some of the most disturbed clusters known @xcite .",
    "eleven of these clusters are visible to ami which is currently restricted to a declination range of 20@xmath43 to 85@xmath43 . since the clash sample",
    "is composed mainly of abell and macs clusters , all eleven clusters in the sub - sample had in fact been observed ( with varying sensitivities ) by ami in 2009 to 2012 .",
    "these observations showed that the field of view of maj1720 + 3536 contains too bright a source to allow sz mapping with ami .",
    "we discard this cluster leaving an ami - clash sub - sample of ten .",

    "the model we employ for this analysis is described in @xcite and @xcite , and is based on a number of key assumptions .",
    "the first two are the functional forms of the dark matter density profile and the gas pressure profile within a spherical geometry .",
    "the non - baryonic matter distribution of a cluster is described using a nfw model ,    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is an overall normalisation coefficient and the scale radius , @xmath64 , is the value of @xmath65 at which @xmath66 .",

    "we focus on the comprehensive work of @xcite , which follows the cluster merger process for three merger mass ratios for each of three merger impact parameters ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "from example merger stages in the paper itself and the suite of simulation videos online , at http://visav.phys.uvic.ca/~babul/merger_paperi/ , this study provides simulations of both the x - ray and the sz signals , ideal for the focus of this paper , as well as the x - ray temperature , gas surface density and entropy .",
    "while these simulations include the effects of radiative cooling , star formation and minimal feedback from supernovae , @xcite make clear that they do not include factors such as feedback from agn , magnetic fields , pressure due to cosmic rays , and conduction .    in the following ,",
    "we compare the simulated x - ray morphology and temperature maps with real x - ray maps and temperature profiles on the @xmath4 accept database . for clusters that appear relaxed , or very close to relaxed , we class their dynamical state as @xmath825gyr since first pericentre ( the first closest approach of the secondary cluster to the primary ) , as depicted by poole et al . :",
    "we class a611 , a1423 , a2261 and maj1423 + 2404 in this way .",
    "the x - ray morphologies of a611 and a1423 do not look similar to any of the simulated merger stages , with circular shapes and no visible concentrations of x - ray emission .",

    "simulations after 5gyr apart from an area of isolated substructure lying approximately 0.7mpc from the cluster centre ( see e.g. maughan et al . ) .",
    "given the low x - ray temperature and agreement of sz and x - ray parameter estimates , it could be the start of a very high mass - ratio merger , well before first pericentre .",
    "maj1423 + 2404 also has a relaxed x - ray morphology and displays little discrepancy between x - ray - estimated and sz - estimated @xmath1 vs @xmath2 in figure [ fig : ymratio ] and @xmath5 vs @xmath6 in figure [ fig : tempszx ] , also supporting a relaxed classification .",
    "rxj1532 + 3021 is reportedly a very strong cool - core cluster , supporting a relaxed classification .",
    "@xcite investigate the x - ray morphology using @xmath83-@xmath84 and deep @xmath4 observations and reveal central substructure from substantial agn activity and a cold front .",
    "the authors conclude that the origin of the cold front is either cool gas dragged out by the agn outburst or turbulence from sloshing of the cool core induced by a minor merger .",
    "figure [ fig : tempszx ] shows good agreement between @xmath5 and @xmath6 values but sz- and x - ray - derived @xmath1 and @xmath2 values in figure [ fig : ymratio ] are more discrepant .",
    "this supports the theory of a low - level merger proposed by hlavacek - larrondo et al . which may be old enough to no longer exhibit the higher temperatures associated with mergers .",
    "although clj1226 + 3332 is classed by @xcite and @xcite as relaxed given its x - ray morphology , differences in sz and x - ray parameter values suggest otherwise .",
    "figures [ fig : ymratio ] and [ fig : tempszx ] show large discrepancies between x - ray and sz in @xmath1 and @xmath2 and in average temperature estimates .",
    "the average x - ray temperature and temperature profiles from @xmath4 on the accept database , and @xmath83-@xmath84 in @xcite , show very high temperatures for the low mass of clj1226 + 3332 , suggesting an early - stage merger . in conjunction with its circular shape ,",
    "slightly displaced x - ray peak brightness from the cluster centre and some substructure towards the south - west , clj1226 + 3332 is likely a recent , close to head - on , minor merger .",
    "maughan et al . and",
    "@xcite also discuss the non - relaxed state of clj1226 + 3332 .",
    "jee & tyson compare their weak - lensing mass reconstruction with the x - ray temperature map of maughan et al . : they note the correlation of a high - temperature asymmetry with an area of low - luminosity substructure to the south - west of the cluster centre , concluding that the substructure has just passed through the primary cluster .    maj0647 + 7015 ( strong - lensing selected ) has high values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , both of which are very discrepant from the sz values in figure [ fig : tempszx ] .",
    "figure [ fig : ymratio ] shows large differences also between sz and x - ray @xmath1 and @xmath2 values .",
    "the x - ray morphology is non - circular with no central peak in x - ray surface brightness which , along with the high @xmath6 values , indicate maj0647 + 7015 has recently undergone a close to head - on major merger .",
    "maj0717 + 3745 has a complicated x - ray morphology that suggests multiple mergers : a triple merger , according to @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : ymratio ] shows large differences between x - ray and sz measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "no significant discrepancy is evident between the sz and x - ray temperatures at 700kpc , in figure [ fig : tempszx ] .",
    "this is likely due to effects of annular averaging over a complex x - ray temperature distribution that is poorly approximated by the model profile in both x - ray and sz analyses .",
    "this is supported by a larger discrepancy in average temperature , for which annular averaging was not used .",
    "parameter estimation for maj0744 + 3927 suggests a relaxed state .",
    "both @xmath85 and @xmath86 are consistent with the values estimated from sz , shown by figure [ fig : tempszx ] , and there is no significant discrepancy in @xmath1 and @xmath2 between sz and x - ray in figure [ fig : ymratio ] .",
    "the accept x - ray temperature profile shows a low peak temperature for the mass of the cluster and some evidence for a cool - core .",
    "however , the x - ray morphology does not appear relaxed : there is a clear displacement in x - ray peak brightness from the centre and some extended clump features .",
    "these indicate an old merger returning to a relaxed state , supported by the small cool core .    in a strong - lensing investigation of maj1149",
    "+ 2223 , @xcite found the mass distribution to be best described as a main dark matter halo plus three , group - sized halos .",
    "@xcite suggest that the high velocity dispersion , measured by @xcite , arises from merging along the line of sight .",
    "there is , however , no significant discrepancy between x - ray  estimated and sz  estimated parameter values in figures [ fig : ymratio ] and [ fig : tempszx ] ; we argue that there are two reasons that may explain this .",
    "the first reason concerns the mass of the main halo compared with any of the masses of the group halos .",
    "given the findings of smith et al . and the low x - ray temperature , we expect the individual merging groups to be of low mass relative to the primary cluster : @xcite show the x - ray temperatures reached in binary mergers of 1:1 and 3:1 are much higher than in 10:1 mergers , where the temperature is lower with larger impact parameter .",
    "the lack of a high x - ray surface - brightness region in the accept @xmath4 maps also indicates that mergers are of high impact - parameter .",
    "the second reason concerns the complex shape of the system , evident in the accept images , for which annular averaging will be problematic .",
    "we expect the x - ray temperature profile to be biased low due to cooler , higher - radius gas being included in each annulus .",
    "we have observed the eleven clusters in the clash sample that are accessible to ami , and discard one due to a very bright source on the edge of the field of view .",
    "the remaining ten clusters have been analysed in a fully bayesian way to give estimated parameter values from sz measurement .    1 .",
    "although 20 out of the 25 clash sample members were selected to be relaxed , we find disagreement in the literature on the dynamical states of many of our ami - clash sub - sample , illustrating the difficulty in determining cluster dynamical state and identifying mergers .",
    "we investigate the correlations in our model and use it to calculate @xmath87@xmath88 curves , varying @xmath30 and redshift .",
    "we discuss the effect these parameters have on the power - laws fitted to the curves : @xmath87@xmath88 is dependent on the cluster redshift and on the value of @xmath30 .",
    "x - ray studies have found sensitivity of the scatter about scaling relations to the dynamical states of the clusters included . here",
    ", we investigate the sensitivity of our model correlations to dynamical state by introducing variations in cluster pressure profile shape parameters : a consequence of merger activity that can be induced in the analysis . in our analysis",
    "these are fixed to the  universal \" values .",
    "varying @xmath70 , the shape parameter best constrained by ami sz data , over a large range induces only small changes in scaling relation power - laws .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who track cluster observables of merging systems in the plane of scaling relations , finding very little perpendicular scatter but large variations along the scaling relation , over the course of a merger .",
    "4 .   due to the difference in dependence of sz and x - ray measurement on @xmath0 ,",
    "x - ray observables are much more sensitive to changes in mass , pressure , temperature and density during a merger .",
    "discrepancies between parameter estimates derived from sz and x - ray measurement can help identify clusters undergoing mergers . denoting @xmath41 by @xmath1 ( for x - ray and sz ) , we compare two @xmath1@xmath2 scaling relations of the sub - sample members : one plotted using ami sz parameter values and the second using @xmath4 x - ray parameters from @xcite .",
    "in addition to a difference in scatter we see an apparent  movement \" of sample members along the line of the relation , between sz and x - ray .",
    "these discrepancies are visualised by plotting the ratios of ami and @xmath4 @xmath1 and @xmath2 values showing a population of our sub - sample for which the sz and x - ray parameters agree well .",
    "other clusters are discrepant by up to @xmath602 , all towards higher x - ray @xmath1 and @xmath2 values _ along _ the line of the relation .",
    "we also plot temperature estimates made from sz and x - ray observation and find a similar split of clusters into two populations that are in agreement with those found from the ratios of ami and @xmath4 @xmath1 and @xmath2 values .",
    "this result comes from the comparison of ami sz parameter estimates with those from three independent x - ray analyses , addressing possible inconsistencies between methods .",
    "dynamical state classifications in the literature of the ten clusters report : a611 , maj1423 + 2404 and rxj1532 + 3021 are relaxed ; maj0647 + 7015 , maj0717 + 3745 and maj1149 + 2223 are mergers ; and a1423 , a2261 , clj1226 + 3332 , and maj0744 + 3927 have mixed reports .",
    "using discrepancies in sz and x - ray parameter estimates and comparisons of @xcite merger simulations with x - ray morphology we determine the dynamical states of the ten clusters in the sub - sample .",

    "maj1149 + 2223 , although reported in the literature as highly disturbed , shows no significant discrepancies between sz and x - ray parameters .",
    "we conclude that low mass infalling cluster groups with high impact - parameters will cause less gas shocking and/or fractionation than lower mass - ratio mergers .",
