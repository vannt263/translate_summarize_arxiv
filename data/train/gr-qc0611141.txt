    "the really novel feature of general relativity ( henceforth abbreviated gr ) , as compared to other field theories in physics , is that spacetime is not a fixed background arena that merely stages physical processes .",
    "rather , spacetime is itself a dynamical entity , meaning that its properties depend in parts on its specific matter content .",
    "hence , contrary to the newtonian picture , in which spacetime acts ( via its inertial structure ) but is not acted upon by matter , the interaction between matter and spacetime now goes both ways .",
    "saying that the spacetime is ` dynamic ' does not mean that it ` changes ' with respect to any given external time .",
    "time is clearly within , not external to spacetime .",
    "accordingly , solutions to einstein s equations , which are whole spacetimes , do not as such describe anything evolving . in order to take such an evolutionary form , which is , for example , necessary to formulate an initial value problem",
    ", we have to re - introduce a notion of ` time ' with reference to which we may speak of ` evolution ' .",
    "this is done by introducing a structure that somehow allows to split spacetime into space and time .",

    "we assume that @xmath7 can be foliated by a family @xmath9 of spacelike leaves .",
    "that is , for each number @xmath10 there is an embedding of a fixed 3-dimensional manifold @xmath0 into @xmath7 , @xmath11 whose image @xmath12 is just @xmath4 , which is a spacelike submanifold of @xmath7 ; see fig.[fig : nico1 ] .",
    "it receives a riemannian metric by restricting the lorentzian metric @xmath8 of @xmath7 to the tangent vectors of @xmath4 .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of the 3-manifold @xmath0 .",
    "if we endow @xmath0 with the riemannian metric @xmath13 then @xmath14 is isometric to the submanifold @xmath4 with the induced metric .",
    "each three dimensional leaf @xmath4 now corresponds to an instant of time @xmath10 , where @xmath10 is so far only a topological time : it faithfully labels instants in a continuous fashion , but no implication is made as to its relation to actual clock readings .",
    "the statement of such relations can eventually only be made on the basis of dynamical models for clocks coupled to the gravitational field .    by means of the foliation",
    "we now recover a notion of time : we view spacetime , @xmath15 , as the one - parameter family of spaces , @xmath16 .",
    "spacetime then becomes nothing but a ` trajectory of spaces ' . in this way",
    "we obtain a dynamical system whose configuration variable is the riemannian metric on a 3-manifold @xmath0 .",
    "it is to make this point precise that we carefully distinguish between the manifold @xmath0 and its images @xmath4 in @xmath7 . in the dynamical formulation",
    "given now , there simply is no spacetime to start with and hence no possibility to embed @xmath0 into something . only _",
    "after _ solving the dynamical equations can we construct spacetime and interpret the time dependence of the metric of @xmath0 as being brought about by ` wafting ' @xmath0 through @xmath7 via a one - parameter family of embeddings @xmath1 .",
    "but initially there is only a 3-manifold @xmath0 of some topological type , that is , solutions exist for _ any _ topology .",
    "however , one often imposes additional requirements on the solution .",
    "for example , one may require that there exists a moment of time symmetry , which will make the corresponding instant @xmath4 a totally geodesic submanifold of @xmath7 , like e.g. in recollapsing cosmological models at the moment of maximal expansion . in this case the topology of @xmath0 will be severely restricted .",
    "in fact , most topologies @xmath0 will only support geometries that always expand or contract somewhere . ] and the equations of motion together with some suitable initial data . for a fuller discussion",
    "we refer to the comprehensive work by isham and kucha  @xcite .",
    "whereas a specified motion of @xmath0 through @xmath7 , characterized by the family of embeddings  ( [ eq : sigmaembedding ] ) , gives rise to a one - parameter family of metrics @xmath17 , the converse is not true .",
    "that is to say , it is not true that _ any _ one - parameter family of metrics @xmath17 of @xmath0 can be obtained by finding a spacetime @xmath15 and a one parameter family of embeddings @xmath1 , such that ( [ eq : spatialmetric ] ) holds .    moreover , there is clearly a huge redundancy in creating @xmath15 from the family @xmath18 , since there are obviously many different motions of @xmath0 through the same @xmath7 , which give rise to apparently different solution curves @xmath17 .",
    "this redundancy can be locally parameterized by four functions , on @xmath0 : a scalar field @xmath19 and a vector field @xmath20 . in the embedding picture",
    ", they describe the components of the velocity vector field @xmath21 normal and tangential to the leaves @xmath4 respectively .",
    "we write @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the normal to @xmath4 . the tangential component",

    "hence we write @xmath32 in the embedding picture @xmath33 is the extrinsic curvature of @xmath4 in @xmath7 .    the first order evolution equations that result from einstein s field equations are then of the general form @xmath34 where @xmath35 in ( [ eq : evolution1 ] ) is given by the right - hand side of ( [ eq : hdot ] ) .",
    "@xmath36 is a more complicated function whose precise structure need not interest us now and which also depends on matter variables ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , the initial data for the gravitational variables consist of a differentiable 3-manifold @xmath0 , a riemannian metric @xmath30  the configuration variable , and another symmetric second rank tensor field @xmath31 on @xmath0  the velocity variable",
    ". however , the pair @xmath37 can not be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "this is because there is a large redundancy in describing a fixed spacetime @xmath7 by a foliation ( [ eq : sigmaembedding ] ) . on the infinitesimal level",
    "this gauge freedom is just the freedom of choosing @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the gauge transformations generated by @xmath20 are just the spatial diffeomorphisms of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath20 may be an arbitrary function of @xmath10 , which corresponds to the fact that we may arbitrarily permute the points in each leaf @xmath4 separately ( only restricted by some differentiability conditions ) .",
    "the gauge transformations generated by @xmath19 correspond to pointwise changes in the velocities with which the leaves @xmath4 push through @xmath7 .",
    "these too may vary arbitrarily within the leaves as well as with coordinate time @xmath10 .",
    "whenever there is gauge freedom in a dynamical theory , there are so - called _ constraints _ , that is , conditions which restrict the initial data ; see e.g.  @xcite . for each gauge freedom parameterized by an arbitrary function ,",
    "there is one functional combination of the initial data which has to vanish . in our case",
    "there are four gauge functions , @xmath19 , and the three components of @xmath20 .",
    "accordingly there are four constraints , which group into one _ scalar or hamiltonian constraint _ , @xmath38=0 $ ] , and three combined in the _ vector or diffeomorphism constraint _ , @xmath39=0 $ ] .",
    "their explicit expressions are : and use the abbreviation @xmath40 . hence @xmath41 has the physical dimension of @xmath42 .",

    "finally @xmath50 is the so called dewitt metric , which at each point of @xmath0 defines an @xmath30-dependent lorentzian metric on the @xmath51  dimensional space of symmetric second - rank tensors at that point .",
    "its explicit form is given by @xmath52 note that the linear space of symmetric second - rank tensors is viewed here as the tangent space ( ` velocity space ' ) of the space @xmath53 of riemannian metrics on @xmath0 . from ( [ eq : wdwmetric1 ] ) one sees that it is the trace part of the ` velocities ' , corresponding to changes of the scale ( conformal part ) of the riemannian metric , that span the negative - norm velocity directions .",
    "the presence of constraints and their relation to the evolution equations is the key structure in canonical gr .",
    "it is therefore instructive to point out how this structure arises from the conventional , four dimensional form of einstein s equations . before doing this , it is useful to first remind ourselves on the analogous situation in electrodynamics .",
    "so let us first consider electrodynamics in minkowski space . as usual , we write the field tensor @xmath54 as exterior differential of a vector potential @xmath55 , that is @xmath56 . in components this reads @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 are the components of the electric , @xmath59 of the magnetic field , where @xmath60 is a cyclic permutation of 123 .",
    "the homogeneous maxwell equations now simply read @xmath61 , whereas the inhomogeneous maxwell equations are given by ( in components ) : @xmath62 where here @xmath63 is the electric four - current . due to its antisymmetry , the field tensor obeys the identity @xmath64 taking the divergence of ( [ eq : inhmaxwelleq ] ) and using ( [ eq : maxwellid1 ] ) leads to @xmath65 showing the well known fact that maxwell s equations imply charge conservation as integrability condition .    let us now interpret the role of charge conservation in the initial - value problem .",
    "decomposing ( [ eq : maxwellid1 ] ) into space and time derivatives yields @xmath66 even though the right - hand side contains third derivatives in the field @xmath67 , time derivatives appear at most in second order ( since @xmath68 is spatial ) .",
    "hence , since it is an identity , @xmath69 contains time derivatives only up to first order .",
    "but the initial data for the second order equation ( [ eq : inhmaxwelleq ] ) consist of the field @xmath67 and its first time derivative . hence the time component @xmath70 of maxwell s equations gives a relation amongst initial data , in other words , it is a _",
    "constraint_. clearly this is just the gau constraint @xmath71 ( here @xmath45 is the electric charge density )",
    ". only the three spatial components of ( [ eq : inhmaxwelleq ] ) contain second time derivatives and hence propagate the fields .",
    "they provide the evolutionary part of maxwell s equations .",
    "now , assume we are given initial data satisfying the constraint @xmath72 , which we evolve according to @xmath73 .",
    "how can we be sure that the evolved data again satisfy the constraint ?",
    "to see when this is the case , we use the identity ( [ eq : maxwellid2 ] ) and solve it for the time derivative of @xmath70 : @xmath74 this shows : if initially @xmath73 ( and hence @xmath75 ) , then the constraint @xmath72 is preserved in time if and only if @xmath76 .",
    "charge conservation is thus recognized as the necessary and sufficient condition for the compatibility between the constraint part and the evolutionary part of maxwell s equations .",
    "finally we wish to make another remark concerning the interplay between constraints and evolution equations .",
    "it is clear that a solution @xmath77 to ( [ eq : inhmaxwelleq ] ) satisfies the constraint on _ any _ simultaneity hypersurface of an inertial observer ( i.e. spacelike plane ) .",
    "if the normal to the hypersurface is @xmath78 , this just states that @xmath79 implies @xmath80 .",
    "but the converse is obviously also true : if @xmath80 for all timelike @xmath78 , then @xmath79 . in words :",
    "given an electromagnetic field that satisfies the constraint ( for given external current @xmath63 ) on _ any _ spacelike plane in minkowski space , then this field must necessarily satisfy maxwell s equations . in this sense ,",
    "maxwell s equations are the _ unique _ propagation law that is compatible with gau constraint .    after this digression we return to gr , where we can perform an entirely analogous reasoning .",
    "we start with einstein s equations , in which the spacetime metric @xmath81 is the analog of @xmath67 and the einstein tensor @xmath82 is the analog of @xmath83 .",
    "they read @xmath84 due to four dimensional diffeomorphism invariance , we have the identity ( twice contracted second bianchi - identity ) : @xmath85 which is the analog of ( [ eq : maxwellid1 ] ) . taking the covariant divergence of ( [ eq : einsteinequation ] ) and using ( [ eq : bianchiid ] ) yields @xmath86 which is the analog of ( [ eq : maxwellid2 ] ) .",
    "hence the vanishing covariant divergence of @xmath87 is an integrability condition of einstein s equations , just as the divergencelessness of the electric four - current was an integrability condition of maxwell s equations .",
    "does not as such imply a conservation law . only in presence of a spacetime symmetry ,",
    "i.e. a killing vector field @xmath88 , the current @xmath89 is conserved , @xmath90 , and hence gives rise to a conserved quantity . ]    in order to talk about ` evolution ' , we consider the foliation ( [ eq : sigmaembedding ] ) of @xmath7 and locally use coordinates @xmath91 such that @xmath92 is the normal @xmath23 to the leaves and all @xmath93 are tangential . expanding ( [ eq : bianchiid ] ) in terms of partial derivatives gives : @xmath94 which is the analog of ( [ eq : maxwellid3 ] ) .",
    "now , since the @xmath95 contain at most second and the @xmath96 at most first derivatives of the metric @xmath81 , this identity immediately shows that the four components @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) contain at most first time derivatives @xmath92 .",
    "but einstein s equations are of second order , hence the four equations @xmath99 are relations amongst the initial data , rather than being evolution equations .",
    "in fact , up to a factor of -2 they are just the constraints  ( [ eq : hamconstraint1][eq : diffconstraint1 ] ) : @xmath100 moreover , the remaining purely spatial components of einstein s equations are equivalent to the twelve first - order evolution equations ( [ eq : evolution1]-[eq : evolution2 ] ) .",
    "the interplay between constraints and evolution equations can now be followed along the very same lines as for the electrodynamic analogy .",
    "expanding the left equality of ( [ eq : einsteinid ] ) in terms of partial derivatives gives @xmath101 which is the analog of ( [ eq : maxwellid4 ] ) .",
    "it shows that the constraints are preserved by the evolution if and only if the energy - momentum tensor of the matter has vanishing covariant divergence .",
    "let us now turn to the last analogy : the uniqueness of the evolution preserving constraints .",
    "clearly einstein s equations @xmath102 imply @xmath103 for any timelike vector field @xmath78 . hence the constraints are satisfied on any spacelike slice through spacetime . again",
    "the converse is also true : given a gravitational field such that @xmath103 for any timelike @xmath78 ( and given external @xmath87 ) , then this field must necessarily satisfy einstein s equations . in this sense einstein s equations follow uniquely from the condition of constraint preservation",
    ".    this property will be crucial for the interpretation of the quantum theory discussed below .",
    "we know from quantum mechanics that the classical trajectories have completely disappeared at the fundamental level . as we have discussed above , the analogue to a trajectory is in gr provided by a spacetime given as a set of three dimensional geometries . in quantum gravity ,",
    "the spacetime will therefore disappear like the classical trajectory in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the evolution equations and will be absent in quantum gravity .",
    "all the information will be contained in the quantized form of the constraints and .",
    "we have seen above that einstein s equations can be written as a dynamical system ( [ eq : evolution1][eq : evolution2 ] ) with constraints ( [ eq : hamconstraint1][eq : diffconstraint1 ] ) . here",
    "we wish to give its canonical formulation .",
    "basically this means to introduce momenta for the velocities and write the first - order equations of motions as hamilton equations .",
    "this means to identify the poisson structure and the hamiltonian .",
    "the result is this : as before , the configuration variable is the riemannian metric @xmath104 on @xmath0 .",
    "its canonical momentum is now given by @xmath105 so that the poisson brackets are @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the dirac distribution on @xmath0 .",
    "elimination of @xmath108 in favour of @xmath109 in the constraints leads to their canonical form : @xmath110 & & \\,=\\,2\\kappa\\,g_{ab\\,cd}\\pi^{ab}\\pi^{cd } \\,-\\,(2\\kappa)^{-1}\\sqrt{h}({}^{\\scriptscriptstyle ( 3)}\\!r-2\\lambda)\\ , + \\,\\sqrt{h}\\rho\\,,\\\\ \\label{eq : diffconstraint3 } & d^a[h,\\pi ] & & \\,=-2\\nabla_b\\pi^{ab}\\,+\\,\\sqrt{h}j^a\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now ) .",
    "@xmath111 is the inverse to @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath112 , and _ not _ obtained by simply lowering the indices using @xmath104 . ]",
    "@xmath113 likewise , rewriting ( [ eq : evolution1][eq : evolution2 ] ) in terms of the canonical variables shows that they are just the flow equations for the following hamiltonian : @xmath114=\\int_\\sigma d^3x \\bigl\\{\\alpha(x ) h[h,\\pi_{ab}](x)+\\beta^a(x)d_a[h,\\pi](x)\\bigr\\}+\\text{boundary terms}\\,.\\ ] ] the crucial observation to be made here is , that , up to boundary terms , the total hamiltonian is a combination of pure constraints .",
    "the boundary terms generally appear if @xmath0 is non - compact , as it will be the case for the description of isolated systems , like stars or black holes . in this case",
    "the boundary terms are taken over closed surfaces at spatial infinity and represent conserved poincar charges , like energy , linear- and angular momentum , and the quantity associated with asymptotic boost transformations .",
    "if , however , @xmath0 is closed ( i.e. compact without boundary ) all of the evolution will be generated by constraints , that is , pure gauge transformations ! in that case , evolution , as described here , is not an observable change .",
    "for that to be the case we would need an extrinsic clock , with respect to which ` change ' can be defined . but a closed universe already contains  by definition  everything physical , so that no external clock exists .",
    "accordingly , there is no external time parameter .",
    "rather , all physical time parameters are to be constructed from within our system , that is , as functional of the canonical variables . a priori",
    "there is no preferred choice of such an intrinsic time parameter . the absence of an extrinsic time and the non - preference of an intrinsic one is commonly known as the _ problem of time _ in hamiltonian ( quantum- ) cosmology .",
    "finally we turn to the commutation relation between the various constraints . for this",
    "it is convenient to integrate the local constraints ( [ eq : hamconstraint3][eq : diffconstraint3 ] ) over lapse and shift functions .",

    "first ,  ( [ eq : calgebra1 ] ) shows that the diffeomorphism generators form a lie subalgebra .",
    "second ,  ( [ eq : calgebra2 ] ) shows that this lie subalgebra is not a lie ideal .",
    "this means that the flow of the hamiltonian constraint does not leave invariant the constraint hypersurface of the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "finally , the term @xmath118 in ( [ eq : calgebra3 ] ) contains the canonical variable @xmath30 , which is used implicitly to raise the index in the differential in order to get the gradient @xmath47 .",
    "this means that the relations above do not make the set of all @xmath119 and all @xmath120 into a lie algebra .",
    "in this section we wish to point out that the relations ( [ eq : calgebra1][eq : calgebra3 ] ) follow a general pattern , namely to represent the ` algebra ' of hypersurface deformations , or in other words , infinitesimal changes of embeddings @xmath121 . to make this explicit , we introduce local coordinates @xmath122 on @xmath0 and @xmath123 on @xmath7 .",
    "an embedding is then locally given by four functions @xmath124 , such that the @xmath125 matrix @xmath126 has its maximum rank 3 ( we write @xmath127 ) .",
    "the components of the normal to the image @xmath128 are denoted by @xmath129 , which should be considered as functional of @xmath124 .",
    "the generators of normal and tangential deformations of @xmath130 with respect to the lapse function @xmath19 and shift vector field @xmath20 are then given by @xmath131\\,\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta y^\\mu(x)}\\,,\\\\   \\label{eq : tangentdef } & t_\\beta & & \\,=\\ , \\int_\\sigma d^3x\\ \\beta^a(x)\\,y^\\mu_{,a}(x)\\ ,   \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta y^\\mu(x)}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which may be understood as tangent vectors to the space of embeddings of @xmath0 into @xmath7 .",

    "( in technical terms , the mapping from vector fields to phase - space functions is a lie-_anti_-homomorphism . )",
    "this shows that ( [ eq : calgebra1][eq : calgebra3 ] ) just mean that we have a hamiltonian realization of hypersurface deformations . in particular , ( [ eq : calgebra1][eq : calgebra3 ] ) is neither characteristic of the action nor the field content : _ any",
    "_ four dimensional diffeomorphism invariant theory will gives rise to this very same ` algebra ' .",
    "it can be shown that under certain general locality assumptions the expressions ( [ eq : hamconstraint3 ] ) and ( [ eq : diffconstraint3 ] ) give the unique 2-parameter ( here @xmath41 and @xmath136 ) family of realizations for @xmath137 and @xmath138 satisfying ( [ eq : alghypdef1][eq : alghypdef3 ] ) on the phase space parameterized by @xmath139 ; see  @xcite and also  @xcite .",
    "as we have just discussed , einstein s equations take the form of a constrained hamiltonian system if put into canonical form .",
    "the unconstrained configuration space is the space of all riemannian metrics on some chosen 3-manifold @xmath0 .",
    "this space is denoted by @xmath140 .",
    "any two riemannian metrics that differ by an action of the diffeomorphism constraint are gauge equivalent and hence to be considered as physically indistinguishable .",
    "let us briefly mention that the question of whether and when the diffeomorphism constraint actually generates all diffeomorphisms of @xmath0 is rather subtle .",
    "certainly , what is generated lies only in the identity component of the latter , but even on that it may not be onto .",
    "this occurs , for example , in the case where @xmath0 contains asymptotically flat ends with non - vanishing poincar charges associated .",
    "asymptotic poincar transformations are then not interpreted as gauge transformations ( otherwise the poincar charges were necessarily zero ) , but as proper physical symmetries ( i.e. changes of state that are observable in principle ) .",
    "leaving aside the possible difference between what is generated by the constraints and the full group @xmath141 of diffeomorphisms of @xmath0 , we may consider the quotient space @xmath142 of riemannian _",
    "geometries_. this space is called _ superspace _ in the relativity community ( this has nothing to do with supersymmetry ) , which we denote by @xmath143 . now from a topological viewpoint @xmath140 is rather trivial .",

    "but upon factoring out @xmath141 the quotient space @xmath143 inherits some of the topological information concerning @xmath0 , basically because @xmath141 contains that information  @xcite .",

    "however , if topology changes , @xmath15 necessarily contains closed timelike curves  @xcite .",
    "this fact has sometimes been taken as rationale for ruling out topology change in ( classical ) gr .",
    "but it should be stressed that closed timelike curves do not necessarily ruin conventional concepts of predictability . in any case , let us accept this slight pathology and ask what other structures we wish to define on @xmath7 .",
    "for example , in order to define fermionic matter fields on @xmath7 we certainly wish to endow @xmath7 with a @xmath150 spin structure .",
    "this is where now the first real obstructions for topological transitions appear  @xcite .",
    "be the spacelike boundary of the lorentz manifold @xmath7 , then @xmath151 has to be even for @xmath7 to admit an @xmath150 spin structure . ]",
    "it is then possible to translate them into selection rules for transitions between all known 3-manifolds  @xcite .",
    "so far the considerations were purely kinematical . what additional obstructions arise if the spacetime @xmath15 is required to satisfy the field equations ?",
    "here the situation becomes worse .",
    "it is , for example , known that any topology - changing spacetime that satisfies einstein s equations with matter that satisfies the weak - energy condition @xmath152 for all lightlike @xmath153 must necessarily be singular . for all lightlike @xmath153 . ]",
    "hence it seems that we need to consider degenerate metrics already on the classical level if topology change is to occur .",
    "can we relax the notion of ` solution to einstein s equations ' so as to contain these degenerate cases as well ?",
    "the answer is ` yes ' if instead of taking the metric as basic variable we rewrite the equations in terms of vierbeine and connections ( first oder formalism ) .",
    "it turns out that the kind of singularities one has to cope with are very mild indeed : the vierbeine become degenerate on sets of measure zero but , somewhat surprisingly , the curvature stays bounded everywhere .",
    "in fact , there is a very general method to generate an abundance of such solutions  @xcite .",
    "it is a much debated question whether topology changing amplitudes are suppressed or , to the contrary , needed in quantum gravity . on one hand ,",
    "it has been shown in the context of specific lower dimensional models that matter fields on topology - changing backgrounds may give rise to singularities corresponding to infinite densities of particle production  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "leaving out topology changing amplitudes in the sum - over - histories approach is heuristically argued to be in conflict with expected properties of localized pseudo - particle - like excitations in gravity ( so called geons ) , like , for example , the usual spin - statistic relation  @xcite .",
    "here there still seems to be much room for speculations .",
    "just in the same way as any lagrangian theory endows the configuration space with the kinetic - energy metric , @xmath140 inherits a metric structure from the ` kinetic - energy ' part of ( [ eq : hamconstraint1 ] ) .",
    "tangent vectors at @xmath144 are symmetric second - rank tensor fields on @xmath0 and their inner product is given by the so - called _ wheeler  dewitt metric _ : @xmath154 due to the pointwise lorentzian signature ( 1 + 5 ) of @xmath50 it is of a hyper - lorentzian structure with infinitely many negative , null , and positive directions each .",
    "however , not all directions in the tangent space @xmath155 correspond to physical changes .",
    "those generated by diffeomorphism , which are of the form @xmath156 for some vector field @xmath20 on @xmath0 are pure gauge .",

    "moreover , it is easily seen that the inner product ( [ eq : dewittmetric ] ) is invariant under @xmath141 .",

    "however , this procedure only works if the horizontal subspace of @xmath155 is truly complementary to the vertical space of gauge directions .",
    "however , this is not guaranteed due to @xmath165 not being positive definite : whenever there are vertical directions of zero @xmath164norm , there will be non - trivial intersections of horizontal and vertical spaces .",
    "sufficient conditions on @xmath30 for this _ not _ to happen can be derived , like , for example , a strictly negative ricci tensor  @xcite .",
    "the emerging picture is that there are open sets in @xmath143 in which well defined hyper - lorentzian geometries exist , which are separated by closed transition regions in which the signature of these metrics change .",

    "einstein s theory of gr has now been brought into a form where it can be subject to the procedure of canonical quantization . as we have argued above , all the information that is needed",

    "one might first attempt to solve the constraints on the classical level and then to quantize only the reduced , physical , degrees of freedom .",
    "this is already impossible in quantum electrodynamics ( except the case of freely propagating fields ) , and it is illusory to achieve in gr .",
    "one therefore usually follows the procedure proposed by dirac and tries to implement the constraints as conditions on physically allowed wave functionals .",
    "the constraints and the become the quantum conditions @xmath166 where the ` hat ' is a symbolic indication for the fact that the classical expressions have been turned into operators .",
    "this procedure also applies if other variables instead of the three - metric and its momentum are used ; for example , such quantum constraints also play the role in loop quantum gravity , cf .",
    "the contributions of nicolai and peeters as well as thiemann to this volume . in the present case the resulting formalism",
    "is called quantum geometrodynamics .",
    "quantum geometrodynamics is defined by the transformation of @xmath167 into a multiplication operator and @xmath168 into a functional derivative operator , @xmath169 .",
    "the constraints and then assume the form , restricting here to the vacuum case for simplicity , @xmath170 equation is called the",
    "_ wheeler  dewitt equation _ in honour of the work by bryce dewitt and john wheeler ; see e.g. @xcite for details and references .",
    "in fact , these are again infinitely many equations ( one equation per space point ) .",
    "the constraints are called the _ quantum diffeomorphism ( or momentum ) constraints_. occasionally , both ( [ wdw ] ) and ( [ momentum ] ) are referred to as wheeler  dewitt equations . in the presence of non - gravitational fields ,",
    "these equations are augmented by the corresponding terms .",
    "the argument of the wave functional @xmath171 is the three - metric @xmath167 ( plus non - gravitational fields ) .",
    "however , because of , @xmath171 is invariant under coordinate transformations on three dimensional space ( it may acquire a phase with respect to ` large diffeomorphisms ' that are not connected with the identity ) .",
    "a most remarkable feature of the quantum constraint equations is their ` timeless ' nature  the external parameter @xmath10 has completely disappeared . instead of an external time",
    "one may consider an ` intrinsic time ' that is distinguished by the kinetic term of .",
    "as can be recognized from the signature of the dewitt metric , the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation is locally hyperbolic , that is , it assumes the form of a local wave equation .",
    "the intrinsic timelike direction is related to the conformal part of the three - metric . with respect to the discussion in the last section one",
    "may ask whether there are regions in superspace where the wheeler  dewitt metric exists and has precisely one negative direction . in that case the wheeler  dewitt equation would be strictly hyperbolic ( rather than ultrahyperbolic ) in a neighbourhood of that point .",
    "it has been shown that such regions indeed exist and that they include neighbourhoods of the standard round three - sphere geometry  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the full wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation that describes fluctuations around the positive curvature friedmann universe is strictly hyperbolic . in this case",
    "the scale factor of the friedmann universe could serve as an intrinsic time .",
    "the indefinite nature of the kinetic term reflects the fact that gravity is attractive  @xcite .",
    "there are many problems associated with the quantum constraints and .",
    "an obvious problem is the ` factor - ordering problem ' : the precise form of the kinetic term is open  there could be additional terms proportional to @xmath172 containing at most first derivatives in the metric .",
    "since second functional derivatives at the same space point usually lead to undefined expressions such as @xmath173 , a regularization ( and perhaps renormalization ) scheme has to be employed . connected with this is the potential presence of anomalies , cf .",
    "the contribution by nicolai and peeters .",
    "another central problem is what choice of hilbert space one has to make , if any , for the interpretation of the wave functionals .",
    "no final answer to this problem is available in this approach  @xcite .    what about the semiclassical approximation and the recovery of an appropriate external time parameter in some limit ?",
    "for the full quantum constraints this can at least be achieved in a formal sense ( i.e. , treating functional derivatives as if they were ordinary derivatives and neglecting the problem of anomalies ) ; see  @xcite .",
    "the discussion is also connected to the question : where does the imaginary unit i in the ( functional ) schrdinger equation come from ?",
    "the full wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation is real , and one would thus also expect real solutions for @xmath171 .",
    "an approximate solution is found through a born  oppenheimer - type of scheme , in analogy to molecular physics .",
    "the state then assumes the form @xmath174/\\hbar ) \\ , \\psi[h,\\phi]\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 is an abbreviation for the three - metric , and @xmath175 stands for non - gravitational fields .",
    "in short , one finds that    * @xmath176 obeys the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation for the gravitational field and thereby defines a classical spacetime which is a solution to einstein s equations ( this order is formally similar to the recovery of geometrical optics from wave optics via the eikonal equation ) .",
    "* @xmath177 obeys an approximate ( functional ) schrdinger equation , @xmath178 where @xmath179 denotes the hamiltonian for the non - gravitational fields @xmath175 .",
    "note that the expression on the left - hand side of is a shorthand notation for an integral over space , in which @xmath47 stands for functional derivatives with respect to the three - metric .",
    "semiclassical time @xmath10 is thus defined in this limit from the dynamical variables . *",
    "the next order of the born - oppenheimer scheme yields quantum gravitational correction terms proportional to the inverse planck mass squared , @xmath180 .",
    "the presence of such terms may in principle lead to observable effects , for example , in the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "oppenheimer expansion scheme distinguishes a state of the form from its complex conjugate .",
    "in fact , in a generic situation both states will decohere from each other , that is , they will become dynamically independent  @xcite .",
    "this is a type of symmetry breaking , in analogy to the occurrence of parity violating states in chiral molecules .",
    "it is through this mechanism that the i and the @xmath10 in the schrdinger equation emerge .",
    "the recovery of the schrdinger equation raises an interesting issue .",
    "it is well known that the notion of hilbert space is connected with the conservation of probability ( unitarity ) and thus with the presence of an external time ( with respect to which the probability is conserved ) .",
    "the question then arises whether the concept of a hilbert space is still required in the _ full _ theory where no external time is present .",
    "it could be that this concept makes sense only on the semiclassical level where holds .",
    "the major physical applications of quantum gravity concern cosmology and black holes .",
    "although the above presented formalism exists , as yet , only on a formal level , one can study models that present no mathematical obstacles .",
    "typically , such models are obtained by imposing symmetries on the equations  @xcite .",
    "examples are spherical symmetry ( useful for black holes ) and homogeneity and isotropy ( useful for cosmology ) .",
    "quantum cosmology is the application of quantum theory to the universe as a whole .",
    "let us consider a simple example : a friedmann universe with scale factor @xmath181 containing a massive scalar field @xmath175 . in this case",
    ", the diffeomorphism constraints are identically fulfilled , and the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation reads @xmath182 this equation is simple enough to find solutions ( at least numerically ) and to study physical aspects such as the dynamics of wave packets and the semiclassical limit  @xcite .",
    "there is one interesting aspect in quantum cosmology that possesses far - reaching physical consequences . because does not contain an external time parameter @xmath10 , the quantum theory exhibits a kind of determinism drastically different from the classical theory  @xcite@xcite .",
    "consider a model with a two - dimensional configuration space spanned by the scale factor , @xmath183 , and a homogeneous scalar field , @xmath175 , see fig .",
    "( such a model is described , for example , by with @xmath184 . ) the classical model be such that there are solutions where the universe expands from an initial singularity , reaches a maximum , and recollapses to a final singularity .",
    "classically , one would impose , in a lagrangian formulation , @xmath185 ( satisfying the constraint ) at some @xmath186 ( for example , at the left leg of the trajectory ) , and then the trajectory would be determined .",
    "this is indicated on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "6 .        in the quantum theory ,",
    "on the other hand , there is no @xmath10",
    ". the hyperbolic nature of a minisuperspace equation such as suggests to impose boundary conditions at @xmath187 constant . in order to represent the classical trajectory by narrow wave packets",
    ", the ` returning part ' of the packet must be present ` initially ' ( with respect to @xmath183 ) .",
    "the determinism of the quantum theory then proceeds from small @xmath183 to large @xmath183 , not along a classical trajectory ( which does not exist ) .",
    "this behaviour has consequences for the validity of the semiclassical approximation and the arrow of time .",
    "in fact , it may in principle be possible to understand the origin of irreversibility from quantum cosmology , by the very fact that the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation is asymmetric with respect to the intrinsic time given by @xmath183 .",
    "the framework of canonical quantum cosmology is also suitable to address the quantum - to - classical transition for cosmological variables such as the volume of the universe  @xcite@xcite . using the approach of loop quantum gravity ( see thiemann s contribution )",
    "one arrives at a wheeler  dewitt equation in cosmology which is fundamentally a difference equation instead of a differential equation of the type . in the ensuing framework of loop quantum gravity",
    "it seems that the classical singularities of gr can be avoided .",
    "singularity avoidance for collapse situations can also be found from spherically symmetric models of quantum geometrodynamics .",
    "for example , in a model with a collapsing null dust cloud , an initially collapsing wave packet evolves into a superposition of collapsing and expanding packet  @xcite .",
    "this leads to destructive interference at the place where the singularity in the classical theory occurs .",
    "other issues , such as the attempt to give a microscopic derivation of the bekenstein  hawking entropy ( see the contribution by c.  kiefer to this volume ) , have been mainly addressed in loop quantum gravity .",
