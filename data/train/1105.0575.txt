    "a farey sequence of order @xmath0 is the sorted sequence of irreducible fractions between @xmath1 and @xmath2 with denominators less than or equal to @xmath0 and arranged in increasing values .",
    "therefore , each farey sequence starts with @xmath1 and ends with @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the farey sequences of orders 1 to 4 are : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "farey sequences , which in some papers are incorrectly called farey series , can be constructed using mediants ( the mediant of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath11 ) : the farey sequence of order @xmath0 is obtained from the farey sequence of order @xmath12 by computing the mediant of each two consecutive values in the farey sequence of order @xmath12 , keeping only the subset of mediants that have denominator @xmath0 , and placing each mediant between the two values from which it was computed .",
    "note that neighboring fractions in a sequence are unimodular , i.e. if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are neighboring fractions , then @xmath15 .",
    "it was john farey who in 1816 conjectured that new terms in @xmath16 could be obtained as mediants from two consecutive terms in @xmath17 .",
    "cauchy proved the conjecture and used the term farey sequences for the first time .",
    "however , farey sequences were in fact introduced in 1802 by c. haros , see @xcite .",
    "farey sequences have many interesting properties , which we will not review here and we refer the interested reader to the abundant literature on this topic , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "as we are interested in some connections of these sequences with graph theory , we first mention their relation with farey trees ( which some authors call farey graphs , but are a different structure than the graphs studied in this paper ) . a farey tree is a binary tree labeled in terms of a farey sequence and it is constructed as follows : the left child of any number is its mediant with the nearest smaller ancestor , and the right child is the mediant with its nearest larger ancestor . using 2/3 as an example",
    ", its closest smaller ancestor is 1/2 , so the left child is 3/5 , and its closest larger ancestor is 1/1 , and the right child is 3/4 .",
    "the process can continue indefinitely , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fareytree ] . note that on each level the numbers appear always in order and that all the rationals within the interval [ 0,1 ] are included in the infinite farey tree .",
    "moreover , the farey sequence of order @xmath0 may be found by an inorder traversal of this tree , backtracking whenever a number with denominator greater than @xmath0 is reached .",
    "the farey tree is a subtree of the stern - brocot tree which contains all positive rationals , see for example  @xcite .",
    "a farey sequence can be related to a graph construction known as farey graph .",
    "a farey graph @xmath18 is a graph with vertex set on irreducible rational numbers between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and two rational numbers @xmath13 and @xmath14 are adjacent in @xmath18 if and only if @xmath15 or @xmath19 , or equivalently if they are consecutive terms in some farey sequence @xmath20 .",
    "note that the graph can be obtained from a subtree of the farey tree by adding new edges , or equivalently , a subtree of the farey tree is a spanning tree of a farey graph .",
    "this graph was first introduced by matula and kornerup in 1979 and further studied by colbourn in 1982 , and has many interesting properties .",
    "for example , they are minimally 3-colorable , uniquely hamiltonian , maximally outerplanar and perfect , see @xcite        in this paper we introduce a simple construction method for a family of farey graphs , inspired by the mediant calculation of new nodes in the farey tree .",
    "other than the properties proved for general farey graphs in  @xcite , we determine analytically , for this family of graphs , their order , size , degree distribution , degree correlations , clustering and transitivity coefficients , diameter , and average distance .",
    "the graphs are of interest as models for complex systems  @xcite , as the parameters computed match those of their associated networks .",
    "they have small - world characteristics ( a large clustering with small average distance ) and they are minors of the pseudo - fractal networks  @xcite and apollonian graphs  @xcite , but in these cases the graphs are also scale - free ( their degree distribution follows a power - law ) , see  @xcite , while in our case the degrees follow an exponential distribution",
    ". however , relevant networks , which describe technological and biological systems , like some electronic circuits and protein networks are almost planar and have an exponential degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "this farey graph family is also related to some random networks constructed following the method known as geographical attachment  @xcite .",
    "in this section we give an iterative construction method for a family of farey graphs . when modeling real world networks , iterative methods can be used to mimic the processes that drive their evolution .",
    "for example , in social , collaborative and some technological and biological networks it is very likely that a new node will join to nodes that are already adjacent .",
    "this suggests the following graph construction :    [ def : fareygraph ] the graph @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with vertex set @xmath24 and edge set @xmath25 is constructed as follows :    for @xmath26 , @xmath27 has two vertices and an edge joining them .    for @xmath28 , @xmath21 is obtained from @xmath29 by adding to every edge introduced at step @xmath30 a new vertex adjacent to the endvertices of this edge .    .",
    "therefore , at @xmath26 , @xmath27 is @xmath31 , at @xmath32 the graph is @xmath33 , at @xmath34 the graph has five vertices and seven edges , etc .",
    "notice that the graph @xmath21 , @xmath35 , can also be constructed recursively from two copies of @xmath29 , by identifying two initial vertices -one from each copy of @xmath29- and adding a new edge between the other two initial vertices , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fareygraphs0to3 ] .    in what follows",
    "we will call a _ generating edge _ an edge that , according to the definition  [ def : fareygraph ] , is used to introduce a new vertex in the next iteration step .     to @xmath36 .",
    ", width=453 ]    this graph construction is deterministic , and uses an iteration process similar to that of  @xcite where dorogovtsev _ et al . _ introduced a graph , which they called `` pseudofractal scale - free web '' constructed as follows : at each step , for every edge of the graph ( not only those introduced at the last step as in our graph construction ) , a new node is added , which is attached to the endvertices of the edge . in their construction",
    "the starting graph is @xmath33 .",
    "this graph construction was generalized in  @xcite .",
    "all these graphs have relevant distinct properties with respect to the farey graph family defined here .",
    "finally , our graphs constitute the extreme case @xmath37 of the random construction in  @xcite , where at each step an edge is chosen with probability @xmath38 , and after the insertion of the new vertex and edges , the edge is removed .",
    "we can see that our construction produces farey graphs by labeling the vertices : if the two initial vertices are labeled @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and each new added vertex is labeled with the mediant of the two vertices where it is joined , the vertices verify the definition of farey graphs as given , for example , by colbourn in  @xcite or biggs in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , as has been proved there , the graphs @xmath21 are minimally 3-colorable , uniquely hamiltonian , maximally outerplanar and perfect .    thanks to the deterministic nature of the graphs @xmath21 , we can give exact values for the relevant topological properties of this graph family , namely , order , size , degree distribution , clustering , transitivity , diameter and average distance .    to find the order and size of @xmath21",
    ", we denote the number of new vertices and edges added at step @xmath41 by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "these edges are generating edges .",
    "thus , initially ( @xmath26 ) , we have @xmath44 vertices and @xmath45 edges in @xmath27 .    as each generating edge produces a new vertex and two generating edges at the next iteration ,",
    "we have that @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which leads to @xmath48 and @xmath49    therefore , the order of the graph is @xmath50 and the total number of edges is @xmath51 and we have :    the order and size of the graph @xmath22 are , respectively , @xmath52    the average degree is @xmath53 . for large @xmath41 ,",
    "it is small and approximately equal to @xmath54 .",
    "many real - life networks are sparse in the sense that the number of links in the network is much less than @xmath55 , the maximum number of links  @xcite .",
    "in this section we find analytically the degree distribution , degree correlations , clustering and transitivity coefficients , diameter and average distance of the graphs @xmath21 .",
    "when studying networks associated with complex systems , the degree distribution is an important characteristic related to their topological , functional and dynamical properties .",
    "most real life networks follow a power - law degree distribution and are called scale - free networks",
    ". however , relevant networks , which describe technological and biological systems , like some electronic circuits and protein networks have an exponential degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "the well known watts - strogatz small world network model also follows an exponential degree distribution  @xcite as it is the case of the farey graphs analyzed here .",
    "the degree distribution of @xmath21 is deduced from the following facts : initially , at @xmath26 , the graph has two vertices of degree one .",
    "when a new vertex @xmath56 is added to the graph at step @xmath57 , this vertex has degree @xmath58 and it is connected to two generating edges . from the construction process",
    ", all vertices of the graph , except the initial two vertices , are always connected to two generating edges and will increase their degrees by two units at the next step .",
    "[ deg - dist ] the cumulative degree distribution of the graph @xmath21 follows an exponential distribution @xmath59    we denote the degree of vertex @xmath56 at step @xmath41 by @xmath60 . by construction",
    ", we have @xmath61 if @xmath57 ( @xmath62 ) is the step at which a vertex @xmath56 is added to the graph , then @xmath63 and hence @xmath64 therefore , the degree distribution of the vertices of the graph @xmath21 is as follows : the number of vertices of degree @xmath65 , equals , respectively , to @xmath66 and the two initial vertices have degree @xmath67 .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath68 for a network gives the probability that a randomly selected vertex has exactly @xmath69 edges . in the analysis of the degree distribution of real life networks ,",
    "see  @xcite , it is usual to consider their cumulative degree distribution , @xmath70 which is the probability that the degree of a vertex is greater than or equal to @xmath69 .",
    "networks whose degree distributions are exponential : @xmath71 , have also an exponential cumulative distribution with the same exponent : @xmath72    because the contribution to the degree distribution of the two initial vertices of a farey graph is small , we can use eq .",
    "( [ deg - growing ] ) , and we have for @xmath21 that @xmath73 .",
    "hence , for large @xmath41 @xmath74      the study of degree correlations in a graph is a particularly interesting subject in the context of network analysis , as they account for some important network structure - related effects  @xcite .",
    "one first parameter is the average degree of the nearest neighbors for vertices with degree @xmath69 as a function of this degree value  @xcite , which we denote as @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath75 increases with @xmath69 , it means that vertices have a tendency to connect to vertices with a similar or larger degree . in this case",
    "the graph is called assortative  @xcite . in contrast , if @xmath75 decreases with @xmath69 , which implies that vertices of large degree are likely to be adjacent to vertices with small degree , then the graph is said to be disassortative .",
    "the graph is uncorrelated if @xmath76 .",
    "we can obtain an exact analytical expression of @xmath75 for the farey graphs @xmath21 . note that except for the initial two vertices of step @xmath1 , no vertices introduced at the same time step , which have the same degree , will be adjacent to each other .",
    "all adjacencies to vertices with a larger degree are produced when the vertex is added to the graph , and then the adjacencies to vertices with a smaller degree are made at each subsequent step .",
    "this results in the expression [ deg - growing ] , i.e. @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and we can write :    @xmath79\\ ] ]    where @xmath80 represents the degree of a vertex at step @xmath41 , which was generated at step @xmath81 . here",
    "the first sum on the left - hand side accounts for the adjacencies made to vertices with larger degree ( i.e. @xmath82 ) when the vertex was introduced at step @xmath81 .",
    "the second sum represents the edges introduced to vertices with a smaller degree at each step @xmath83 .",
    "and the last term explains the adjacencies made to the initial vertices of step @xmath1 .",
    "( [ knn01 ] ) leads to @xmath84 writing eq .",
    "( [ knn02 ] ) in terms of @xmath69 , we have @xmath85 thus we have obtained the degree correlations for those vertices generated at step @xmath86 . for the initial two vertices ,",

    "( [ knn03 ] ) and  ( [ knn04 ] ) , it is obvious that for large graphs ( i.e. @xmath89 ) , @xmath90 is approximately a linear function of @xmath69 , which suggests that farey graphs are assortative .",
    "degree correlations can also be described by the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath91 of the degrees of the endvertices of the edges . for a general graph @xmath92",

    "this coefficient is in the range @xmath98 .",
    "if the graph is uncorrelated , the correlation coefficient equals zero .",
    "disassortative graphs have @xmath99 , while assortative graphs have a value of @xmath100 .",
    "if @xmath101 denotes the pearson degree correlation of @xmath21 , we have    the pearson degree correlation coefficient of the graph @xmath21 is @xmath102[corrft ]    we find the degrees of the endvertices for every edge of the farey graph . let @xmath103 stand for the @xmath96th edge in @xmath21 connecting two vertices with degrees @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "then the initial edge created at step @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath104 . by construction , at step @xmath81 ( @xmath105 ) , @xmath106 new edges are added to the graphs .",
    "each new iteration will increase the degree of these vertices .",
    "these edges connect new vertices , which have degree 2 , to every vertex in @xmath107 which have the following degree distribution at step @xmath108 : @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) and @xmath111 . at each of the subsequent steps of @xmath108",
    ", all these vertices will increase their degrees by two , except the two initial vertices , the degree of which grow by one unit .",
    "thus , at step @xmath41 , the number of edges @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) is @xmath114 and the number of edges @xmath115 is 2 .",
    "now we can explicitly find the sums in eq .",
    "[ rne ] : @xmath116 which lead to the stated result .",
    "we can easily see that for @xmath41 large , @xmath101 tends to the value @xmath117 , which again indicates that the farey graphs are assortative .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a graph is another parameter used to characterize small - world networks .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a vertex was introduced in  @xcite to quantify this concept : given a graph @xmath118 , for each vertex @xmath119 with degree @xmath120 , its _ clustering coefficient _",
    "@xmath121 is defined as the fraction of the @xmath122 possible edges among the neighbors of @xmath56 that are present in @xmath123 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath124 is the number of edges between the @xmath120 vertices adjacent to vertex @xmath56 , its clustering coefficient is @xmath125 whereas the _ clustering coefficient _ of @xmath123 , denoted by @xmath126 , is the average of @xmath121 over all vertices @xmath56 of @xmath123 : @xmath127    some authors , see for example @xcite , use another definition of _ clustering coefficient _ of @xmath123 : @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are , respectively , the number of _ triangles _ ( subgraphs isomorphic to @xmath33 ) and the number of _ triples _ ( subgraphs isomorphic to a path on @xmath131 vertices ) of @xmath123 .",
    "a triple at a vertex @xmath56 is a @xmath131-path with central vertex @xmath56 .",
    "thus the number of triples at @xmath56 is @xmath132 the total number of triples of @xmath123 is denoted by @xmath133 .    using these parameters ,",
    "note that the clustering coefficient of a vertex @xmath56 can also be written as @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the number of triangles of @xmath123 which contain vertex @xmath56 . from this result",
    ", we see that @xmath136 if , and only if , @xmath137 and this is true for regular graphs or for graphs such that all vertices have the same clustering coefficient .",
    "@xmath138 is known in the context of social networks as _",

    "when a new vertex @xmath56 joins the graph , its degree is @xmath142 and @xmath124 equals 1 .",
    "each subsequent addition of an edge to this vertex increases both parameters by one .",
    "thus , @xmath124 equals to @xmath143 for all vertices at all steps .",
    "therefore there is a one - to - one correspondence between the degree of a vertex and its clustering . for a vertex @xmath56 of degree @xmath120 ,",
    "the expression for its clustering coefficient is @xmath144 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this scaling of the clustering coefficient with the degree has been observed empirically in several real - life networks  @xcite .",
    "the same value has also been obtained in other models  @xcite .",
    "we use the degree distribution found above to calculate the the clustering coefficient of the graph @xmath21 .",
    "clearly , the number of vertices with clustering coefficient @xmath2 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , is equal to @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "thus , the clustering coefficient of the graph @xmath139 is easily obtained for any arbitrary step @xmath41 : @xmath152 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2^t+1}\\left [   2^{t}\\ln 2 -\\frac{1}{2 } \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2},1,1+t\\right)+\\frac{4}{t+1}\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the clustering coefficient @xmath139 tends to @xmath153 for large @xmath41 .",
    "thus the clustering coefficient of @xmath21 is high .    to find the transitivity coefficient we need to calculate the number of triangles and the number of triples of the graph .",
    "the number of triangles of @xmath21 is @xmath154    at a given step @xmath41 the number of new triangles introduced to the graph is the number of generating edges , which are the edges introduced in the former step @xmath155 .",
    "therefore @xmath156 , and as @xmath157 , we have the result .",
    "moreover , again from the results found above giving the number of vertices of each degree , we obtain straightforwardly the following result for the number of triples :    the number of triples of @xmath21 is @xmath158    @xmath159    now the transitivity coefficient follows from the former two lemmas .",
    "the transitivity coefficient of @xmath21 is : @xmath160    we see that while the clustering coefficient increases with @xmath41 and tends to @xmath153 , the transitivity coefficient tends to 0 .",
    "the small - world concept describes the fact that , in many real - life networks , there is a relatively short distance between any pair of nodes . in this case",
    "we will expect an average distance , and in some cases a diameter , which scales logarithmically with the graph order .",
    "next we verify this two relations for the farey graphs @xmath161 .",
    "computing the exact diameter of @xmath21 can be done analytically , and gives the result shown below .",

    "the diameter is 1 .    at each step",
    "@xmath165 , by the construction process , the longest path between a pair of vertices is for some vertices added at this step .",
    "vertices added at a given step @xmath28 are not adjacent among them and are always connected to two vertices that were introduced at different former steps .",
    "now consider two vertices introduced at step @xmath165 , say @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "@xmath166 is adjacent to two vertices , and one of them must have been added to the graph at step @xmath168 or a previous one .",
    "we consider two cases : ( a ) for @xmath169 even and from @xmath166 we reach in @xmath170 `` jumps '' a vertex of the graph @xmath27 , which we can also reach from @xmath167 in a similar way .",
    "thus @xmath171 .",
    "( b ) @xmath172 is odd . in this case",
    "we can stop after @xmath170 jumps at @xmath173 , for which we know that the diameter is 1 , and make @xmath170 jumps in a similar way to reach @xmath167 . thus @xmath174 .",
    "this bound is reached by pairs of vertices created at step @xmath41 .",
    "more precisely , by those two vertices @xmath166 and @xmath167 which have the property of being connected to two vertices introduced at steps @xmath30 , @xmath168 .",
