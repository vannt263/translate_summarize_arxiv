    "sn 1572 was well observed in europe ( as well as in the far  east ) for almost two years .",
    "it added a new aspect to the debate at the time over the aristotelian cosmological views , as it forced to reconsider the immutability of the heavens and the solid nature of the celestial spheres : the `` star '' gained brightness and lost it during a period of two years , but it showed no detectable parallax . according to prevalent views about the heavens , mutability would only happen in the sublunar region .",
    "this was even the place where comets were assumed to originate .",
    "the appearence of sn 1572 challenged the order of the celestial spheres .",
    "the observers who followed it up[multiblock footnote omitted ] took sides with respect to established aristotelian views . today",
    "we can still use their observations to see whether that supernova would be of use for cosmology in a different way , as a distance indicator if seen by observers billions of years away from us .",
    "it is indeed possible to have a clear idea of where sn 1572 stands among its class .",
    "after several centuries of questioning the nature of sn 1572 , the identification as a type i supernova came through the revision of the light curve done by baade ( 1945 ) and based on data taken or quoted by tycho brahe ( 1603a ) . before that time there were still speculations on whether it was a variable star of some kind , a nova ( morgan 1945 ) and it was even still considered the suggestion of its cometary nature ( lynn 1883 ) .",
    "the cometary idea expressed in 1573 by jernimo muoz was based on the fact that the event is aligned with the milky way , so its decay in luminosity could be explained if it was a comet born among the stars that would first approach and then move away from us just along the line of sight .",
    "tycho s _ stella nova _ lies indeed only 4998 pc above the galactic plane .    in modern times",
    ", its comparison with other sne allowed its classification as a type i supernova ( baade 1945 ) .",
    "later on , this class was shown to contain events of very different nature : those identified with the explosion of white dwarfs ( type ia ) and those corresponding to the collapse of massive stars whose envelope had lost its hydrogen content in the interaction with a binary companion ( type ib or c ) .",
    "sn 1572 was of the type ia class as discussed by de vaucouleurs ( 1985 ) and by van den bergh ( 1993 ) .",
    "no further doubts that it is a type ia sn can now be held in view of the x  ray spectrum , which clearly differentiates snia events from sne coming from the collapse of massive stars ( hughes et al . 1995 ) .",
    "a first comparison of its luminosity at maximum with the bulk of sneia would have led to think that it was fainter than normal sneia .",
    "van den bergh ( 1993 ) considers whether it could be a peculiar , subluminous snia , like sn 1991bg .",
    "however , sn 1572 was heavily obscured .",
    "it was reddened by e(b ",
    "v)=0.6@xmath3 0.04 as it corresponds to the reddening of the stars near its position ( ruiz  lapuente et al .",
    "2003a , b ) . after taking into account the extinction undergone across the milky way , as well as the measurement of its decline rate",
    ", it is concluded that sn1572 was not a 91bg  like event .",
    "neither was it an overluminous snia like sn 1991 t or similars , but rather an event in the middle of the snia class .",
    "the date of maximum of sn 1572 is , from the available accounts , the most uncertain record .",
    "the first observation was done on nov 6 though there is no record of the magnitude at that date ( see for a full discussion stephenson & green 2002 ) . on nov 2",
    "it was not yet noticeable as reported by muoz ( 1573 ) . in nov 11 , date of the first observation done by tycho brahe ( 1603a ) and the first reported observation by muoz ( 1573 )",
    ", it seems to have achieved a magnitude between those of jupiter and venus .",
    "the nov 5 detection given in the report of the _ progymnasmata _ by tycho brahe ( 1603b ) is an erroneous date , as we have checked in the original . on nov 16 and 17 ,",
    "when caspar peucer and johannes prtorius saw it , it seems to have a magnitude close to venus ( table 1 and notes ) .",
    "later on , in jan 7 , it was already fainter than jupiter ( muoz 1573 ) .",
    "the reconstruction of the observations suggests an apparent visual magnitude at maximum of 4.0@xmath3 0.3 ( baade 1945 ; de vaucouleurs 1985 ) .",
    "the overall light curve fitting done in the present work by trying different decline rates ( see below ) indicates that the maximum was broad and that it should have taken place around nov 21 . on nov 11 , and even on nov 16 , when peucer and prtorius observed it , it would be still on the rise .",
    "this is consistent with the mean risetime to maximum of sneia of 17.8@xmath4 days ( goldhaber et al .",
    "while most authors have taken arbitrarily nov 15 as the date of visual maximum , it seems obvious that the maximum could not have happened before nov 20 .",
    "the sn 1572 data are compared in this section to templates using the stretch factor _",
    "s _ as characterization of the rate of decline ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; goldhaber et al 2001 ; nobili et al .",
    "the stretch factor _ s _",
    "method is used by the supernova cosmology project to quantify the decline rate of the supernova from data extending up to 60 days after maximum . even in absence of a measurement of the brightness at maximum",
    ", the method allows to produce a fine description of the supernova within the family of decline rates .",
    "the magnitudes and limits on magnitudes for sn 1572 , when compared to templates , lead us to conclude that this supernova was not fast . the best agreement found for sn 1572 corresponds to _ s _ @xmath0 0.9 . in this regard ,",
    "sn 1572 is very similar to sn 1996x which had a _ s _",
    "= 0.889 . a comparison can be seen in figure 1 , where the data of sn 1572 are shown overplotted to a s = 0.9 snia template in v. we also show for comparison the visual light curves of sn 1996x ( normal snia of _ s _ @xmath2 0.889 ) and sn 1991bg ( a fast subluminous event of _ s _ @xmath2 0.62 ) .",
    "therefore , these first 60 days show that there is no similarity with the fast subluminous sn 1991bg .",
    "a broad light curve as the one of sn 1991 t can also be excluded from the constraints about its decline ( see figure 1 ) .      an additional proof that sn 1572 is a standard snia comes from its slow late decline between 100 and 450 days after maximum , similar to that of the bulk of sneia .",
    "sn 1572 had a late decline of 1.4 mag in 100 days during that epoch , in concordance with normal sneia and far from the fast decline of sn 1991bg ( filippenko et al .",
    "1992 ; leibundgut et al .",
    "1993 ; ruiz  lapuente et al . 1993 ; turatto et al .",
    "sn 1990n and other normal sneia had decline rates in such period of 1.381.5 mag in 100 days .",
    "in consistency with the findings near maximum , late  time and overall similarity to the light curves of normal snia is found . in order to test the adequacy of the fit using the whole light curve",
    ", we construct new templates for a normal event of s = 0.9 ( well exemplified by sn 1996x ) , a subluminous 91bg  type event and an overluminous 91t  type event matching the available early and late  time observations . before 60 days",
    "those templates are equal to the hamuy et al .",
    "1996b templates and the scp templates for the corresponding stretches of those sneia . at later times",
    "they follow the available late ",
    "time photometry ( schmidt et al . 1993 ; salvo et al . 2001 ) to their latest available epoch .",
    "the fit of the sn 1572 data to the snia template corresponding to s = 0.9 has a @xmath5 of 14.44 for 10 degrees of freedom , which is acceptable .",
    "in contrast , the fit to the template of a fast declining , underluminous snia like sn 1991bg ( s = 0.62 ) has an exceedingly high @xmath5 of 53.55 for 4 degrees of freedom ( the two premaximum points as well as the last 4 points have been excluded because of the lack of data for those subluminous sneia at such stage ) . in the other extreme ,",
    "the fit to the template of a slow - declining , overluminous snia like sn 1991 t ( s = 1.2 ) is almost as bad , with a @xmath5 of 82.99 for 10 degrees of freedom .    in figure 2 , we show the overall visual light curve till almost 500 days compared with that of sn 1996x and the templates for sn 1991bg and sn 1991 t .",
    "the last upper limit given by tycho brahe indicates that the supernova had not yet leveled off at 480 days past maximum due to a light echo produced in an intervening dust cloud .",
    "not all the sneia in dusty regions have shown light echoes associated with the scattering of the supernova light in neighboring dust clouds , though .",
    "the production of light echos depends on the spatial distribution of dust relative to both observer and supernova . in the case of sn 1986 g , a very heavily reddened supernova ,",
    "such light echo was not observed ( schmidt et al . 1993 ) .",
    "however , for sn 1572 one can not exclude a leveling off occuring later , at a fainter magnitude level .",
    "sn 1991 t and sn 1998bu have indeed shown a slowing down of the v magnitude decline at around 400 days as result of the light echo ( schmidt et al .",
    "1993 , cappellaro et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the leveling off occurs at 500 days about 10 magnitudes below the maximum brigthness . for sn 1572",
    "an equivalent step in the level of brightness would correspond to v@xmath26 , which is about the naked eye limit .",
    "sn 1998bu is a snia very similar to sn 1996x and sn 1572 but with a reddening of e(b ",
    "v)@xmath2 0.32 @xmath3 0.04 ( hernandez et al . 2000 ; cappellaro et al .",
    "in fact , we can think of tycho brahe s supernova as sn 1998bu with twice the reddening .",
    "moreover , the late  time decline of sn 1572 informs us of deposition of the energy from the decay @xmath6co",
    "@xmath7 @xmath6fe in the ejecta of this supernova .",
    "its slow decline would fit the declines predicted for sneia coming from the explosion of chandrasekhar  mass wds .",
    "time decline in v indicates a significant deposition of the energy of the positrons which arise in the decay @xmath6co",
    "@xmath7 @xmath6fe . after 200 days since explosion",
    ", positrons become the dominant source of luminosity .",
    "departures from full trapping of @xmath6co decay are seen in all sneia and they are expected .",
    "they arise from lack of confinement of positrons to the ejecta of the supernova and/or incomplete thermalization of their energies .",
    "various effects can lead to the diversity in the late ",
    "time sn bolometric light curves : nucleosynthesis , kinematic differences , ejected mass , degree of mixing of the ejecta , and configuration and intensity of the magnetic field . in particular , as suggested in ruiz  lapuente & spruit ( 1998 ) , those late  time declines can serve to investigate the magnetic field configuration of the sn and trace it back to the original configuration of the wd right before explosion .",
    "it is found that departures from the full trapping of @xmath6co decay of the order of 1015@xmath8 at about 400 days can be explained by the distribution of radioactive material .",
    "larger departures , of 3040@xmath8 or larger , have to be interpreted in terms of lack of magnetic field confinement of positrons , or even enhancement of the escape favored by a radially combed configuration of the magnetic field . in the case of sn",
    "1991bg the very fast drop of the late light curve suggests not only a total ejected mass well below the chandrasekhar mass , but an absence of a significant tangled magnetic field .",
    "an exploration of the late  time decline predicted for different explosion models compared with a sizeable sample of bolometric light curves was done by milne , the and leising ( 1999 ) .",
    "for sn 1572 , the availability of data is limited to the visual band .",
    "though , analogies can be drawn with similar sneia for which the bolometric data are available .",
    "the late decline is , as seen above , a major proof which confirms that this historical supernova is not part of the estimated 16@xmath8 of intrinsically subluminous sneia ( li et al .",
    "2001 ) , likely arising from a different class of explosion ejecting a smaller amount of mass ( ruiz  lapuente et al .",
    "1993 ) . if it were part of the class of peculiar subluminous sneia , caution should be given when used for cosmology , because it is not clear whether those subluminous events are in the linear relation brightness ",
    "rate of decline .",
    "the most direct estimate of the reddening comes from our measurement of the reddening and extinction of the stars around the geometrical center of sn 1572 at the distance of the supernova ( ruiz  lapuente et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "the stars which are compatible with a distance in the range of 3@xmath31 kpc ( see de vaucouleurs 1985 for a review of the distances towards sn 1572 ) have reddenings which average to e(b  v)=0.6 @xmath3 0.04 .",
    "those values were derived in the programme of search of the companion star of galactic sneia ( ruiz  lapuente et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "star candidates within a radius compatible with the degree of precision on the center and distance gained during the 431 years since explosion are modeled to determine t@xmath9 , log g , metallicity , distance and e(b  v ) .",
    "the radial velocities are measured .",
    "the individual reddening values found in that programme for the stars within 35@xmath8 of the radius of the remnant go from e(b  v ) = 0.50 to e(b  v)=0.8 , the values increasing with distance .",
    "the above mean reddening to sn 1572 corresponds to an extinction @xmath10 1.86 @xmath3 0.12  mag if we take @xmath11 3.1 ( sneden et al .",
    "1978 ; riecke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "the galactic extinction data based on cobe / dirbe observations ( drimmel & spergel 2001 ) give a value of @xmath12 in that direction ( the maximum galactic extinction being @xmath13 there ) . thus the extinction measured at the distance of sn 1572 is in agreement with the cobe results . correcting the apparent brightness from the dimming by dust , we find again that tycho s sn was not subluminous but a `` normal '' sn ia",
    ".    we can correct as well the color of the supernova from the records of the epoch and derive the intrinsic color evolution .",
    "sneia are found to show a similar color evolution two months after maximum , with a well  established law of low intrinsic dispersion valid from 30 to 90 days , explored in phillips et al .",
    "1999 ( ph99 ) based on the work of lira ( 1995 ) :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the time since visual maximum .",
    "the color of sn 1572 two months after discovery was reported to be similar to mars and aldebaran ( thus b  v in the range 1.361.54 ) .",
    "previous and subsequent color estimates are also shown in table 2 .",
    "after correcting the observed color by our measurement of reddening @xmath16 0.6 @xmath3 0.04 , the intrinsic color at 55 @xmath310 days is @xmath17 0.76 @xmath3 0.24 , very much in agreement with the expected @xmath17 0.78 @xmath30.15 for that epoch .",
    "such color fits very well in the ph99 law for the time evolution of the intrinsic color of the sneia . in agreement with that law ,",
    "nobili et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that the color evolution of the bulk of sneia has a low dispersion of 0.1 mag in the tail . before maximum",
    "the corrected color of sn 1572 would be @xmath17 0.22 @xmath3 0.29 , thus consistent with the fact that normal sneia have @xmath18 @xmath0 0 .",
    "sn 1991bg and other subluminous sneia clearly deviate from the standard color evolution at early epochs , being intrinsically red at maximum @xmath19 ( leibundgut et al .",
    "1993 ; ph99 ) .",
    "moreover , the color evolution derived from the b and v templates for a s @xmath2 0.9 snia gives a good agreement with the supernova . in figure 3",
    "we show the color light curve of sn 1572 , corrected by its e(b  v)@xmath2 0.6 , compared with that of `` normal '' sneia . both the peculiar sn 1991bg and the normal sn 1996x",
    "are also shown in their reddening  corrected colors .",
    "the data displayed in this figure come from different observers ( see table 2 and notes ) .",
    "color estimates by eye are difficulted by the lack of an established system which encompases the whole range of colors .",
    "the conversion of eye  estimated colors to our filter scale is addressed in pskovskii ( 1977 ) and schaefer ( 1996 ) . to add to the inherent eye uncertainty in estimating color",
    ", it has to be noted that the first comparisons done by the observers of the time using planets like jupiter , venus or saturn as references , were difficulted by the fact that the planets were often very far from the position of sn 1572 ( away in the sky by 59@xmath20 ) .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1985 ) discussed the effect of that on the early visual estimates ( later estimates since they are done through comparison with particular stars are more reliable ) .    in the nebular phase , at 175 days according to tycho brahe s records ( table 2 ) the supernova went back to a white color , which is consistent , after correcting for extinction , with what is found in normal sneia as well .",
    "uncertainties in the color estimates have been assigned and new records included .",
    "given the apparent visual magnitude , the luminosity of tycho brahe s supernova would have corresponded to a visual absolute magnitude of @xmath21 .",
    "if corrected for @xmath22 = 1.86 @xmath30.12 , this means @xmath23 .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1985 ) gives as the most likely estimate to the distance to sn 1572 3.2 @xmath3 0.3 kpc .",
    "taking 3.2 kpc for the distance , the luminosity would be 19.38 @xmath3 0.42 .",
    "that compares well with the value @xmath24 , the mean magnitude from the caln / tololo sample ( hamuy et al .",
    "1996a ) .    to get a more refined distance to sn 1572",
    ", one would need to follow a similar procedure as in winkler , gupta & knox ( 2003 ) for sn 1006 .",
    "these authors obtained a distance to sn 1006 of 2.18 @xmath3 0.08 kpc using the snr expanding parallax method ( kirshner , winkler & chevalier 1987 ) with precise measurements of the proper motion of the filaments in sn 1006 and narrower estimates of the shock velocity of the expanding remnant .    the proper motion of the filaments in sn 1572 was measured by kamper & van den bergh ( 1978 ) , and it is about 0.22 @xmath3 0.02 @xmath25 yr@xmath26 .",
    "there is , however , a larger uncertainty in the estimate of the shock velocity , which is obtained through modeling of the broad h@xmath27 emission of the material swept up by the sn .",
    "the estimate is model dependent and improves with a better knowledge of the composition of the fully ionized plasma behind the shock .",
    "kirshner , winkler & chevalier ( 1987 ) had suggested from the observations available at that time a distance to sn 1006 between 1.4 and 2.1 kpc and a distance to sn 1572 of 2.02.8 kpc .",
    "the estimates of the shock velocity , though , could soon be revised from the wealth of spectral observations on sn 1572 s filaments taken during the last years .",
    "a rough estimate of the distance to tycho s sn can be made by comparison of the angular diameters of the two historical sneia .",
    "the angular diameter of g327.6 + 14.6 ( the remnant of sn 1006 ) is @xmath28 arcmin whereas that of tycho is @xmath29 arcmin .",
    "we can place @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the respective ages of the remnants and @xmath33 is the ratio of the average expansion velocities of the two sn ejecta .",
    "such approach gives , if we use the distance obtained by winkler , gupta & long ( 2003 ) to sn 1006 , a distance to sn 1572 of @xmath34 kpc , well in the middle of other estimates .",
    "all of the above shows that it is at present hard to escape from the uncertain range in the distance to sn 1572 , i.e. from 2 to 4 kpc with the analyses done so far .",
    "such limitation does not prevent to infer the right place of sn 1572 within the luminosity sample : the conclusion on the brightness ",
    "rate of decline for sn 1572 is based on the gathered empirical evidence and the well  established use of the peak luminosity  decline correlation .",
    "incidentally , if a good distance would be available for sn 1572 , one could obtain the distance to sn 1996x , which is not well determined with the present available methods .",
    "the d@xmath35@xmath36 relation gives a distance modulus @xmath37 = 31.32 @xmath3 0.4 ( faber et al .",
    "1989 ) , whereas the sneia calibration using h@xmath38 = 65 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 would place it a significantly larger distance ( salvo et al .",
    "the very good agreement between the late time light curves of sn 1572 and sn 1996x allows us to infer a @xmath39(sn1572sn1996x ) @xmath2 18.9 @xmath3 0.12 between both sneia .",
