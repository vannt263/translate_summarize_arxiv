    "in a non - centrosymmetric chiral lattice , the competition between the symmetric ferromagnetic exchange , the anti - symmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) and an applied magnetic field can stabilize a highly ordered spin - texture presenting as a hexagonal lattice of spin - vortices called skyrmions @xcite .",
    "magnetic skyrmions have been experimentally detected in materials having the b20-type crystal structure such as mnsi @xcite , fe@xmath3co@xmath4si @xcite , fege @xcite , cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 @xcite and recently also on systems like gav@xmath5s@xmath6 @xcite and beta - mn - type alloys @xcite .",
    "small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) studies of bulk solids evidenced the formation of an hexagonal skyrmion lattice confined in a very narrow region of temperature and magnetic field ( t - b ) in the phase diagram @xcite . in thin films and thinly cut slices of the same compounds instead",
    ", skyrmions can be stabilized over a wider t - b range as revealed by experiments using cryo - lorentz transmission electron microscopy ( ltem ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was proposed that skyrmions can also exist as isolated objects before the formation of the ordered skyrmion lattice in the proximity of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "a recent resonant x - ray diffraction experiment also suggested the formation of two skyrmion sublattices giving rise to regular superstructures @xcite .    on reducing the geometry of interest to two - dimensions ( 2d ) , long - range ordering can be significantly altered by the presence of defects and disorder .",
    "indeed , the competition between order and disorder within the context of lattice formation continues to be an issue of fundamental importance .",
    "here condensed matter systems are well - known to provide important test - beds for exploring theories of structural order in solids and glasses . an archetypal , and conceptually relevant example is the superconducting vortex lattice , where real - space imaging studies allow direct access to the positional correlations and local coordination numbers @xcite . up until now , however , analogous studies of skyrmion lattices have not been reported even though ( as for superconducting vortices ) it is well - known that defects and dislocations present in a sample can pin the motion of skyrmions induced by external perturbations such as an electric field @xcite or a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this competition between disorder and elasticity will clearly give rise to a complex energy landscape promoting diverse metastable states @xcite , and superstructures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , up to now , previous imaging studies of skyrmion lattices could probe only the short range order due to limitations in the size of the imaged area and its homogeneity .    in this paper , by systematic observations using cryo - ltem , we reveal the magnetic field - dependent evolution of the skyrmion - related spin textures in cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 thin plate and study their long - range ordering properties imaging up to @xmath7 lattice constants .",
    "the different phases of the spin textures are analyzed with state - of - the - art methods to unravel their spatial properties . at low magnetic fields , the coexistence of two helical domains",
    "is observed , in contrast to previous studies @xcite ; the angle between the two helices axis is retrieved _ via _ a reciprocal space analysis . at the magnetic field close to the helical - skyrmion phase transition , evidence for a glassy skyrmion phase",
    "is found _ via _ cross - correlation analysis , a method which has recently been applied to the analysis of both x - rays and electron diffraction patterns to retrieve information on the local order and symmetry of colloidal systems @xcite . in this phase ,",
    "we reveal also patches of octagonally distorted skyrmion lattice distribution . in the skyrmion phase , by locating the position of each skyrmion and generating an angle map of the hexagonal unit cell they formed , we obtain a direct - space distortion map of the skyrmion lattice .",
    "this distortion map evidences the presence of orientation - disordered skyrmion lattice domains present within the single crystalline sample .",
    "each domain boundary coincides with a dislocation formed by a seven - five or a five - eight - five frenkel type defect .",
    "the number of such dislocations decreases with increasing magnetic field , and large single - domain regions are formed .",
    "the formation of these mesoscopic domains was also filmed with camera - rate ( msec ) time - resolution .",
    "the presence of differently oriented skyrmion lattice domains was observed in spatially separated regions , or in a same area of the sample but at a different moment in time .",
    "the formation of regular superstructures arising from co - existing misoriented skyrmion lattices proposed by @xcite is ruled out by these experiments .",
    "the observation of split magnetic bragg peaks in reciprocal space can be explained in terms of a spatial or temporal integration of a fluctuating skyrmion lattice , highlighting the importance of a direct - space , real - time probe .",
    "a flat and smooth single - crystalline cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 plate was thinned to 150  nm by the focused ion beam technique .",
    "the sample was prepared as a plate with uniform thickness instead of the wedge shaped sample used in previous studies @xcite .",
    "this sample geometry prevents significant positional drift of skyrmions as it is common for wedge - shaped samples , due to thickness variations or the temperature gradient .",
    "the smoothness and homogeneity of our sample is corroborated by the thickness map shown in the supplementary fig.[thickness map ] .",
    "we capture more than 70,000 skyrmions and span their low temperature phase diagram as a function of the external magnetic field .",
    "all images were recorded in the ( 111 ) sample plane and the magnetic field was applied along the @xmath8-direction .",

    "these two domains are marked by a and b in the insets and are characterized by a stripe period of @xmath18  70  nm . each domain generates a centrosymmetric pair of peaks in reciprocal space , with the propagation vectors for each helical domain rotated with respect to one another by @xmath19 for both @xmath15  g and 128  g ( fig.[fig1]f , g ) .",
    "the intensity of each pair of centrosymmetric peaks in the ft reflects the degree of occupancy of the corresponding helical domain in the real - space image .",
    "these results contrast those of a previous study where only one helimagnetic domain was observed within a probed area of 300 nm @xcite .",
    "however , periodicity values ranging from 50  nm to 70  nm are reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "this variation in the periodicity relates to the strength of the dmi constant d relative to exchange j. it should be independent of sample geometry or size but can depend quite weakly on the applied magnetic field .    at an external field of @xmath17  g , just before the onset of the skyrmion phase , the system is characterized by a glassy distribution with patches of isolated skyrmions and skyrmions in small hexagonal distribution ( fig.[fig1]c and inset ) . here",

    "the corresponding reciprocal space image shows the familiar hexagonal pattern ( fig.[fig1]i , j ) .      to investigate the topology of the magnetic structures at all fields",
    ", we analyzed the reciprocal space patterns obtained from the ft of the direct - space images ( shown in fig.[fig1]f - j ) by means of the cross correlation function ( ccf ) defined as : @xmath22 where , @xmath23 represents the scattered intensity at defined scattering vector @xmath24 , and azimuthal angle @xmath25 , while @xmath26 is the shift between two azimuthal angles .",

    "we apply this methodology to the ft at the phase transition field , where a glassy distribution of skyrmions is observed . in panels g - i of fig.[fig1 ]",
    ", the reciprocal space scattering distribution is shown for three different applied magnetic fields , and a few significant scattering vectors @xmath27 ( with i = 1,2,3,4 ) are highlighted by white circles . at @xmath16  g ,",
    "the scattering features related to the helices , which have a pitch of @xmath28  nm , are found at @xmath29 . at this scattering vector ,",
    "the computation of the ccf yields the orange trace in fig.[fig2]a . upon increasing the magnetic field until the value @xmath17  g two different periodicities are determined in the ccf at @xmath20 .",
    "the first represented by the purple curve is obtained from the two centrosymmetric peaks originating from the helical distribution at this field .",
    "when the peaks from the helical arrangement are masked from the diffraction pattern , the underlying diffuse magnetic scattering in the background at @xmath20 is accessible .",
    "the ccf of the background at @xmath20 shows a hexagonal arrangement ( red curves ) that can be fitted to a harmonic function .",
    "the six - fold periodicity retrieved at @xmath17  g from the magnetic speckle in the background reflects the presence of a disordered hexagonal lattice of skyrmions forming in the proximity of the phase transition and co - existing with one of the two helical domains .",
    "thus at this field , the ccf unravels an incipient orientational order of the skyrmion distribution . upon entering the skyrmion phase , @xmath30  g",
    ", the orientational order is established and the ccf shows sharp peaks ( blue trace ) . since all the periodicities reported in fig.[fig2]a are found at the same distance in reciprocal space , this confirms the equivalent periodicity of both the helical and skyrmion lattice magnetic structures .    the positional order of the incipient skyrmion phase at the transition field ( @xmath17  g ) can be investigated by looking at the scattering vector dependence of the ccf , fig.[fig2]b . at @xmath31 ( @xmath32  nm ) no periodicities are determined ( yellow trace ) , while at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , corresponding to a real - space distance of @xmath28  nm , and @xmath33  nm , six fold ( red trace ) and eight - fold ( blue trace ) modulated ccfs are found , respectively .",
    "the eight fold symmetry is found at a scattering vector corresponding to a slightly larger lattice constant as expected from packing a larger number of skyrmions within the unit cell . at scattering vectors smaller than @xmath34 ( @xmath35  nm ) , no periodicities are determined .",
    "this observation suggests that patches of both orientationally disordered hexagonal and octagonal distribution of skyrmions are found , in which the skyrmion - skyrmion distance is included in the range @xmath36  nm . the presence of such an octagonal distribution can also be seen directly in the real - space image as highlighted in fig.[fig2]c .",
    "the average ccf computed from the ft of all the octagonal regions found in the @xmath13  @xmath11m@xmath12 real - space image is shown in fig.[fig2]d indicating a clear eight - fold periodicity .          in the skyrmion phase ,",
    "we evaluate the role of disorder and defects in the lattice by locating the skyrmions in the real - space image and counting the number of nearest neighbors of each skyrmion via delaunay triangulation .",
    "a representative skyrmion lattice at @xmath37  g is shown in fig.[fig3]a in the background , and the delaunay triangulated lattice is shown as magenta lines .",
    "a perfect skyrmion coordination has a hexagonal symmetry .",
    "an imperfect skyrmion coordination can have more or less than six neighbors and forms a lattice defect . a skyrmion pair with seven and five neighbors",
    "is highlighted with black and red lines , respectively .",
    "a spatial angle map of the orientation of skyrmions ( sections iii and iv of the supplementary information ) is depicted in fig.[fig3]b .",
    "the formation of a multi - domain skyrmion lattice is readily visible in this map with different colors representing different domains .",
    "the delaunay triangulation and the defects are plotted on the foreground of this map .",
    "it is important to note that the domain boundaries coincide with the defects . a zoom - in of a small region marked by a square in panel b is shown in fig.[fig3]c .",
    "the formation of a dislocation at the site of a five - seven defect is evidenced as four lines can be drawn on one side of the seven - five defect , while only three lines can be drawn on the other side .",
    "this dislocation line forms the domain boundary between the two orientations of the skyrmion - lattice that are characterized by blue and yellow regions .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed at all the magnetic fields and the images are shown in the supplementary fig.s9 - 12 . however , as the magnetic field is increased the dislocation density decreases , and large single - domain regions form .",
    "this highlights the fact that a stronger applied field induces higher levels of order .          to understand the fluctuations of the skyrmion - lattice in real - time",
    ", we analyzed a movie acquired for 50s .",
    "each frame is exposed for 100ms and an image is acquired every 500ms .",
    "the full movie is shown in the supplementary movie1 , four frames at selected time points are displayed in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "panels ( a - d ) depict the real - space images and panels ( e - h ) represent the corresponding fts . within this movie , the orientation of the skyrmion lattice",
    "is observed to fluctuate and regions of well - distinguished orientations can be separated . at 0s ( panels a , e ) , the skyrmion lattice forms a single domain .",
    "the corresponding ft shows a relatively sharp hexagonal pattern .",
    "the position of a single bragg peak marked by a black circle can be used as the reference position for marking the deviations in the subsequent frames . at 4s ( panels b , f ) two domains with slightly different orientations",
    "are formed .",
    "accordingly , a set of split bragg peaks is obtained in the reciprocal space map , where the splitting corresponds to the angle between the two domains in the sample with different skyrmion lattice orientations .",
    "one of the two sub - peaks is found within the black reference circle indicating that out of the two domains one domain has the same orientation as that found at 0s while a second domain with a slightly different orientation has formed within this acquisition time . at 12s ( panels c , g ) ,",
    "the peak separation is larger and also the sub - peaks are further away from the black circle indicating a stronger fluctuation of skyrmion lattice .",
    "an interesting point to note in this time frame is that the reciprocal space map of a small region marked by square in panel c also reveals the tendency to have split bragg peaks ( panel c inset ) . in this particular time and space - point , either the two different orientations are found in the same frame at the same time , or switching between the two has happened within the 100ms exposure time . at 32s ( panels d , h )",
    "one of the two domains disappears and forms a new single domain skyrmion lattice which is rotated by about @xmath38 from the domain formed at 0s .",
    "this is evidenced by the single bragg peak found away from the black circle in the ft .",
    "our results clearly emphasize the importance of the time dimension for a proper investigation of the system .",
    "moreover , these observations underline the importance of resolving the skrymion lattice in space and time for revealing its exact topology and the dynamical evolution caused by fluctuations and disordering effects .",
    "our results rule out the existence of two superposed skyrmion sub - lattices within a single magnetic structure domain , as proposed in @xcite , and imply that the observation of a splitting in the magnetic bragg diffraction is caused by the spatial and/or temporal overlap of different lattice orientations within the experimental acquisition time .",
    "remarkably , in specific areas of the sample , we find that disorder can provoke sudden switches between well - defined orientations .",
    "this suggests that the energy landscape of the magnetic system has a complex nature with several local minima separated by subtle barriers .",
    "the ability to resolve the switching between these different minima would allow to estimate and control the energy barriers via _ ad hoc _ external stimuli such as light , electrons or electric fields .",
    "currently , the switching we observed was not entirely resolved due to limitations in the time - resolution of the camera - rate acquisitions .",
    "future experiments with time - resolution in the microseconds to nanoseconds in our ultrafast tem @xcite should therefore be able to fully resolve this behavior .",
    "the application of cryo - ltem for investigating skyrmion dynamics paves the way to advance towards a promising set of spintronics applications arising from the motion and manipulation of the skyrmion lattice .",
    "high - quality single crystals of cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 were synthesized by the method of chemical vapor transport redox reactions .",
    "the crystal was thinned to 150 nm by the focused ion beam technique .",
    "the magnetic structures of the films were investigated by using jeol jem-2200fs cryo - ltem .",
    "images were acquired in the fresnel mode , _",
    "i.e_. defocused imaging @xcite , so that the objective lens was not utilized for imaging but for applying the magnetic field .",
    "the microscope was operated at 200  kv and equipped with a field emission source .",
    "the sample was cooled down to @xmath39  k using the liquid helium tem holder ( gatan ults ) , and a magnetic field ranging from @xmath40  g was applied normal to the thin plate along the [ 111 ] direction .",
