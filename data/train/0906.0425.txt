    "quantum dots ( qds ) recently have attracted much attention as very suitable candidates for studying evolution of a single quantum system .",
    "moreover , qds are very promising candidates for quantum information processing .",
    "an electron spin in a quantum dot is a good representation for a qubit , being a natural two - state quantum system .",
    "manipulations of the single qds and double - qd ( dqd ) systems can be achieved using external magnetic fields and gate voltages @xcite , which implement injection of an electron ( or pair of electrons for dqd ) in a given spin state , or some unitary rotation in a two - spin space .",
    "however , it is not easy to achieve the full set of transformations in the hilbert space of two coupled spins @xcite : some transformations require a strong gradient of magnetic fields on a nanometer scale , and advanced techniques are needed for performing spin rotations rapidly and reliably .",
    "thus , it is interesting to explore other possible ways of manipulating electron spins in dqd structures . in particular",
    ", it is natural to study whether measurement of the charge state of the dqd may help drive the desired evolution of the two - spin system .",
    "the weak continuous measurement @xcite , which monitors the system in question , and therefore affects its evolution , may provide an additional and useful tool for controlling the electron spins in dqd systems . at some level of description of a probed quantum system plus detector ,",
    "it is postulated that the fundamental measurement process consists of direct particle detections ( e.g. , photons , electrons , etc . ) or absence of any detection .",
    "the absence of a detection for specific time interval constitutes a negative result . in both cases ( `` detection '' or `` no detection '' )",
    "the quantum state of the system evolves according to the provided information and the evolution can be described using quantum bayesian inference.@xcite e.g. , for a two - level atom which did not decay by time @xmath0 the evolution of the atom s density matrix takes the form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the conditional probability not to decay from the excited state @xmath3 ( ground state @xmath4 is supposed stable ) , @xmath5 is the spontaneous decay rate , and @xmath6 . the classical bayesian update of the diagonal elements , eq.([atom - bayes1 ] ) , reflects an information - related evolution . also , eq.([atom - bayes2 ] ) shows that the coherence ratio @xmath7 is conserved ; in particular , a pure state remains pure .",
    "the above evolution has been proposed and discussed mainly in the context of quantum optics . @xcite@xmath8@xcite for solid state systems , it has been realized recently , using an artificial two - level system : a superconducting `` phase '' qubit , measured via tunneling of its superconducting phase.@xcite the detection of tunneling was considered as an instantaneous process@xcite in the highly non - linear detector ( dc - squid ) that implies detector relaxation rates much faster than the qubit `` decay rate '' .",
    "is affected by the charge state of the dqd . in quantum zeno regime",
    "the tunneling between dots is suppressed while the spin qubit undergoes continuous negative - result evolution.,width=268 ]    in this paper we consider another realization of a solid state qubit and a linear detector measuring continuously .",
    "nevertheless , it can behave similarly to the above examples in certain measurement regimes .",
    "we will consider a semiconductor double quantum dot ( dqd ) spin system ( fig.[schematic ] ) where two electrons can be in either of the dots and the relevant states are spin - charge states.@xcite at relatively small time scales ( from ns to @xmath9s ) the electron tunneling between the dots preserves the system s total spin that allows spin - selective evolution and leads to the so called spin - to - charge conversion.@xcite this allows the measurement of the dqd spin system by a charge sensitive detector such as a quantum point contact ( qpc)@xcite or single electron transistor ( set).@xcite    for our system ( fig.[schematic ] ) the spin qubit@xcite is formed by the singlet spin state @xmath10 and the triplet state @xmath11 that has a zero spin projection on an external magnetic field ( here , e.g. , @xmath12 denotes a charge state when one electron is in the left dot and the other is in the right dot ) .",
    "spin conservation allows transition between the singlet @xmath10 and the localized singlet , @xmath13 , while a transition from the triplet state is spin - blocked .",
    "thus , the state @xmath13 can be used for preparation and subsequent measurement of the spin qubit . for a weak measurement",
    "the system - detector coupling @xmath14 is finite and defines the time scale of measurement evolution ( in particular , @xmath15 is of the order of the time needed to distinguish the two different charge states by the qpc ) .",
    "the spin system evolution will be an interplay of the non - unitary dynamics due to measurement and the dynamics associated with the system s internal hamiltonian .",
    "the purpose of this work is to develop the theory of quantum evolution of a dqd two - electron spin system under the continuous measurement by a linear charge detector such as a qpc that is based on the bayesian approach.@xcite initially motivated by experiment@xcite we pose the question : `` how the measurement by a qpc will affect the spin qubit state and is it possible to use continuous measurement for manipulation of the quantum state ? ''",
    "the system state is continuously updated according to a given measurement record due to quantum back action.@xcite on typical system s times when many electrons pass through the qpc , the quantum evolution is conditioned on the fluctuating detector current @xmath16 .",
    "we identify regimes when the system - detector coupling becomes large relative to a typical system frequency , that leads to suppression of coherent tunneling transitions .",
    "the associated stabilization of the states in continuous measurement ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) is an analog of the well known quantum zeno effect.@xcite since the system - detector coupling is finite , the zeno stabilization does not last forever .",
    "the stabilized states switch to each other with a rate @xmath17 .",
    "the switching happens on a time scale @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , on this time scale the switching transition becomes irreversible .",
    "for an ensemble averaged description of the state evolution we will show that the irreversibility corresponds to an exponential decay ( compare with ref.@xcite ) with the decay rate @xmath18 .",
    "correspondingly , in the case of a spin qubit we show via numerical simulation of the measurement process that the switching rate @xmath18 plays the role of the spontaneous decay rate @xmath5 for the two - level atom described above . despite the quantum back action noise reflecting the noisy output , the spin qubit state will evolve according to eqs.([atom - bayes1 ] ) , ( [ atom - bayes2 ] ) in a spin - charge basis that corresponds to the zeno stabilized states .",
    "in particular , in our analysis the negative - result evolution of the qubit subsystem is not postulated but emerges from continuous noisy measurement evolution and hamiltonian evolution at a microscopic level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in sec.ii we review / derive the bayesian equations for weak continuous measurement of a dqd two - electron spin system . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the measurement collapse scenarios for different coupling regimes and give qualitative and quantitative explanations of the obtained results . in sec .",
    "iv we estimate the detector - system coupling and other important parameters that could be relevant for an experiment to confirm our results",
    ". we also comment on the role of various sources of decoherence .",
    "the system of two electrons confined in the dqd , and the quantum point contact as a charge sensing detector are shown in fig.[schematic ] .",
    "external gate voltages form the potential profile of the dqd and are well controlled in the experiment.@xcite in particular , changing the energy difference between the dots , @xmath19 , allows continuous tuning of the charge configuration between @xmath12 and @xmath20 : when the electrons are in the right dot @xmath20 the ground state is the spin singlet @xmath13 .",
    "the interdot tunneling coupling @xmath21 allows coherent transitions between the singlet spin - charge states @xmath10 and @xmath13 which are close in energy ( for @xmath22 , the states @xmath10 and @xmath13 are in resonance ) .",
    "transitions between the triplet states @xmath23 and @xmath24 are suppressed due to large energy mismatch : the highly energetic triplet states @xmath25 are well separated in energy from the singlet @xmath13@xcite ( @xmath26 ) due to tight confinement and on site exchange interaction . in the @xmath12 configuration",
    "the spin qubit subspace is formed by the singlet @xmath10 and the triplet state @xmath27 with zero spin projection on an external magnetic field @xmath28 ; the applied field removes the triplet degeneracy by splitting off the @xmath29 states ( splitting @xmath30 for the gaas dqd described in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus , the dqd spin system is considered below as a three state quantum system ( qutrit ) .    introducing the short notations for the relevant three states : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , we write the system hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath34 the presence of the @xmath25 states induces small exchange energies @xmath35 , @xmath36 which can be taken into account perturbatively;@xcite in what follows we will neglect these energies that are of the order of @xmath37 .",
    "other possible terms in the hamiltonian @xmath38 ( that are present for a general qutrit system@xcite ) are suppressed due to conservation of spin .    in the total hamiltonian of system plus detector @xmath39 the ( low transparency ) qpc detector @xcite",
    "is described with @xmath40 here the operator @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) creates an electron in the lower ( upper ) lead of the detector ( fig.[schematic ] ) and the tunneling @xmath43 between leads is assumed energy independent .",
    "the system  detector interaction can be written in analogy with the qubit case ; for a general qutrit measured by a hypothetical detector that can distinguish all three states one formally writes the interaction hamiltonian as proportional to the two [ @xmath44 generators , that are diagonal in the spin - charge basis : @xmath45 \\label{int-2spin } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing detector transmission probability @xmath46 for each system state @xmath47 , the average currents can be expressed as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the detector bias voltage , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the densities of states in the lower and upper lead . in the case of qpc , which can not distinguish between states @xmath32 and @xmath33 the tunneling amplitudes @xmath52 and @xmath28 are not independent : @xmath53 , since the corresponding average currents are equal , @xmath54 .",
    "for the state @xmath31 the average current @xmath55 and it can be distinguished from the @xmath12 states .    in what follows we consider a situation when the internal detector dynamics given by eqs.([detector ] ) , ( [ int-2spin ] ) is much faster than the two - spin dynamics due to @xmath38 .",
    "also , it is assumed that the voltage applied to detector is large so that a typical detector decoherence time is much smaller than the typical electron tunneling times ; thus , @xmath56 .",
    "the first inequality implies that coherences between different electron passages in the qpc can be neglected .",
    "thus , the qpc detector will behave essentially classically on the typical time scale of the dqd two - spin dynamics .",
    "the quantum state evolution of an open quantum system@xcite has an analog in a classical state estimation procedure;@xcite it takes into account the actual measurement record that is imperfectly correlated with the system state . in a situation",
    "when the qpc is a weakly responding detector , @xmath57 , when every tunneling electron brings a little information about the system state , it is reasonable to condition the system evolution on the quasicontinuous noisy detector current @xmath16.@xcite typical measurement time ( that reflects accumulation of a signal - to - noise ratio of order one ) can be introduced@xcite@xmath8@xcite , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the low - frequency spectral density of the detector shot noise .",
    "[ we have neglected small differences between shot noises .",
    "] the finite measurement time implies that given the noisy current @xmath16 , the system state is updated gradually . below we sketch the derivation of the measurement evolution equations for a qutrit related to the `` informational '' bayesian approach.@xcite    for the measurement evolution alone , the most straightforward way is to consider the elementary act of scattering of an incoming electron , @xmath60 , off the qpc tunnel barrier that depends on the charge state of the system , @xmath47 .",
    "the scattered state is expressed as a linear transform of the initial state : @xmath61 where the scattering matrix is ( see , e.g. , ref . )",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the reflection and transmission amplitudes . following jordan and korotkov,@xcite",
    "every tunneling electron can be mapped to an ancilla qubit , whose basis states are the scattering states : @xmath65 for a reflected electron , and @xmath66 for a transmitted electron",
    ". scattering will entangle the states of the ancilla qubit and the qutrit .",
    "then projective measurement on the ancilla will lead to povm ( positive operator - valued measure ) measurement operators@xcite of the form : @xmath67 and @xmath68 that satisfy the completeness condition @xmath69 .",
    "the diagonal form of these operators in the qutrit basis ( the spin - charge basis ) follows from the diagonal form of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath70 , eq.([int-2spin ] ) . for collecting electrons in the upper lead ,",
    "the count of an electron updates the qutrit density matrix according to a povm formula @xmath71 where @xmath72= \\sum_k \\rho_{kk } t_k$ ] is the total probability to find an electron in the upper lead and @xmath73 are the transmission probabilities introduced in the previous section . if an electron was not counted a similar update takes place using the measurement operator @xmath74 and the reflection probabilities , @xmath75 .",
    "in the basis where @xmath76 are diagonal these evolutions take the form of bayesian updates.@xcite    the evolution rate of the system density matrix will be related to the rate of tunneling through the qpc .",
    "introducing an average number @xmath77 of ( independent ) tunneling attempts per time @xmath78 , the average current@xcite ( given the system state @xmath47 ) is then @xmath79 . for times of the order of individual tunneling times , @xmath80",
    ", we can consider a negative - result evolution of the qutrit density matrix .",
    "for the evolution of the diagonal elements in case of no tunneling we write : @xmath81",

    "the evolution of the non - diagonal elements can be shown to be of the form similar to eq.([atom - bayes2 ] ) .",
    "the above evolution can be hardly observed , since for typical system times , @xmath88 , many electrons pass through qpc . for @xmath89 independent attempts one can derive the conditional probability for @xmath90 successful tunnelings@xcite ( per time @xmath91 ) given",
    "the system is in state @xmath47 @xmath92 so that the bayesian update of the system ( qutrit ) density matrix can be shown to be of the form : @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "an set is usually highly non - ideal@xcite , however it may reach ideality close to 1 in the co - tunneling or cooper pair tunneling regime.@xcite it is worthwhile to note that the measurement evolution and the hamiltonian evolution enter in eq.([bayes1 ] ) independently ; they just reflect the measurement ( povm ) and unitary postulates applied to the system at a coarse grained time @xmath119 where the evolution is noisy and quasicontinuous . in sec .",
    "iii we will show via numerical solutions of eq.([bayes1 ] ) that the continuous measurement evolution and the hamiltonian evolution interplay non - trivially so that new effective ( negative - result ) measurement and hamiltonian evolutions of the system arise at a larger time scale .",
    "a total ignorance of a particular measurement result @xmath120 corresponds to a situation when the qpc detector is considered just as a part of a ( markovian ) environment surrounding the system .",

    "other sources of decoherence of the dqd system will be discussed in sec .",
    "when the unitary evolution of the three - state system is taken into account one has to explore the full bayesian eq.([bayes1 ] ) , which , as a rule , does not provide simple solutions . in what follows , using eq.([bayes1 ] ) , we will perform numerical simulation of the measurement process for various regimes of the system - detector dynamics .",
    "the non - trivial interplay of the quantum dynamics can be seen if one compares the effects of measurement evolution alone vs. total evolution .",
    "the measurement alone tends to collapse the system ( qutrit ) in either the state @xmath133 or to the qubit subspace @xmath134 leaving states @xmath135 and @xmath136 unresolved .",
    "however , adding the continuous coherent mixing of @xmath133 and @xmath135 by @xmath38 leads to effective resolution of the states @xmath135 and @xmath136 , so that a continuous collapse happens either to the state @xmath136 or to the remaining spin - singlet subspace .",
    "if the continuous collapse happens to the singlet subspace , at small coupling @xmath14 the system will perform quantum oscillations , that are weakly perturbed by the measurement . when the coupling becomes large",
    "the picture is qualitatively different : one reaches the regime of zeno stabilization of the system s singlet states . the latter is characterized by long time intervals when the qpc current is either @xmath137 or @xmath138 , interupted by rare switching between them ; the qutrit state is correspondingly @xmath32 or @xmath31 . if the system was initially into the qubit subspace , the continuous collapse takes the form of a slow negative - result evolution of the qubit state until it eventually switches to @xmath13 .",
    "the negative - result evolution is a bayesian evolution conditioned by the information that the `` qubit did not switch '' .",
    "this evolution emerges in the zeno regime as a solution of the underlying bayesian stochastic evolution , eq.([bayes1 ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the key feature for establishing a negative - result evolution is the irreversibility of the switching event ( compare with ref . ) . within the stochastic measurement evolution ,",
    "the irreversibility is consistent with an important property of eq.([bayes1 ] ) that is seen in numerical simulations : given a measurement record @xmath16 , two evolutions that start from different initial states , @xmath139 or @xmath140 , will become undistinguishable@xcite at a time scale of the order or greater than @xmath15 . in other words",
    "the system `` forgets '' its initial state , @xmath141 so that further evolution is dominated by the result , @xmath16 itself .",
    "the regime of current stabilization , ( that is essentially classical@xcite ) then would correspond to irreversibility of the switching event .      for a numerical simulation of the measurement process we use eq.([bayes1 ] ) , supplemented with the relation for the current signal , eq.([current - model ] ) , where we incorporated the current level degeneracy for the states @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( @xmath142 ) . in order to understand the collapse scenarios it is instructive to look at the stochastic equation for the relevant density matrix elements transformed from eq.([bayes1 ] ) to their it form@xcite ( below we use @xmath143 ) .",
    "@xmath144 @xmath145 , and @xmath146 here @xmath147 is the current difference between the charge subspaces that can be distinguished by the qpc .",
    "the system - detector coupling explicitly enters in eqs.([r12-ito]),([r13-ito ] ) as @xmath148    in the absence of the hamiltonian , @xmath149 , the equation for @xmath150 becomes a pure noise and decouples ; it can be heuristically considered as a ( position dependent ) wiener process for the restricted variable @xmath151 with a diffusion coefficient , @xmath152 , approaching a minimum ( zero ) at the endpoints , @xmath153 or @xmath154 .",
    "just as in the single qubit case@xcite it suggests that the endpoints are the two possible attractors for a given realization of the measurement . in the qutrit case , the measurement also preserves the ratio @xmath155 and the measurement evolution happens on a ray @xmath156 in the physical triangle of the plane @xmath157 [ @xmath158 . switching on the hamiltonian mixes the density matrix components leaving @xmath159 unaffected ; geometrically this is represented as a horizontal moving in the plane @xmath157 that changes @xmath160 [ causing the system to change from one ray to another ] . from this point of view",
    "it is easy to imagine how the new attractors become @xmath161 ( a horizontal ray ) or the point @xmath162 .",
    "finally , it is clear from eq.([r33 ] ) that if the system is in either of the subspaces , @xmath163 or @xmath136 , it will remain there : neither hamiltonian nor measurement evolution mixes the subspaces , which is true for any dqd parameters , @xmath19 , @xmath21 .",
    "the decoupling of subspaces is a consequence of the spin blockade and indistinguishability of the states @xmath135 and @xmath136 by measurement .",
    "the decoupling implies that the system will continuously collapse to one of the subspaces under a weak continuous measurement as seen in numerical simulations , fig.[weak ] .",
    "since the corresponding ensemble averaged equation for @xmath164 is simply @xmath165 ( ensemble averaging implies just nullifying of the noise in it form of the equations@xcite ) , then the ensemble averaged density matrix element is conserved : @xmath166 .",
    "thus , it must be that the fraction of members of the ensemble that collapses to @xmath167 ( after a sufficient measurement time @xmath0 ) is just @xmath168 , which means that the probability of collapse to either of the subspaces is @xmath168 and @xmath169 respectively ( i.e. , the usual probability rules apply ) .      in order to characterize the emergence of a negative result evolution from continuous noisy measurement we will first consider the case when the system may establish quantum oscillations weakly perturbed by the measurement , i.e. , when negative - result evolution is not yet established . in particular , this happens for small system - detector coupling , @xmath170 while the quantum dots detuning @xmath19 is also small .",

    "on the same time scale , weakly perturbed quantum oscillations are established in this subspace [ solid line on fig.[weak]a ) for @xmath172 ] .",
    "the oscillation scenario in case of collapse to the singlet subspace is easily understood .",
    "once @xmath164 gets to zero , eqs.([r11-ito]),([r12-ito ] ) just become of the same form as that describing quantum oscillations for a single qubit.@xcite for zero detunning , @xmath179 decouples ( @xmath180 ) , while @xmath181 $ ] and @xmath182 $ ] oscillate with a unity amplitude ( for @xmath171 ) , with phase @xmath183 that slowly diffuses in time.@xcite correspondingly , the oscillating scenario can be distinguished by the average current @xmath184 or by the current spectral density @xmath185 ( with @xmath186 being the current correlation function ) .",
    "since the evolution of @xmath164 is transitional in character ( see fig.[weak ] ) , it will not affect the long - time average @xmath187 .",

    "simulations show ( if collapse happened to the spin - singlet subspace ) that the amplitude of quantum oscillations is less than @xmath196 and fluctuates in time .",

    "we have derived in the weak coupling regime ( compare with ref.@xcite ) @xmath198 $ ] so that the qutrit state remains mixed ; for small @xmath129 the qutrit purity approaches @xmath199 . if collapse happens to @xmath200 , the state will purify even for measurement with a non - ideal detector .",
