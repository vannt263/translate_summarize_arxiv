    "multiple quantum ( mq ) coherences are quite suitable for investigations of the dependence of the relaxation time on the size of the quantum system @xcite .",

    "the theoretical methods ( for example , ref.@xcite ) describing the experiments @xcite are phenomenological ones and the development of theoretical and numerical approaches from `` the first principles '' are fully justified . at the same time , numerical methods of mq nmr dynamics allow us , generally speaking , to investigate systems consisting of not more than twenty spins @xcite .",
    "some progress in the study of the larger systems ( up to 40 spins ) is achieved due to the special techniques based on the chebyshev polynomial expansion @xcite and on the phenomenon of quantum parallelism @xcite .",
    "the new perspectives are opened by mq nmr in systems of equivalent spins where the special method has been worked out @xcite allowing one to investigate mq nmr dynamics of hundreds of spins and even more .",
    "such systems of equivalent spins can be created in a nanopore compound placed in a strong external magnetic field if the nanopores are filled with a gas of spin - carring molecules ( atoms ) @xcite . since the characteristic time of the molecular diffusion is much less than the spin flip - flop time @xcite , the dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) of spins",
    "are averaged ( but not to zero ) and the residual ddi can be described by the single coupling constant . as a result , all spins can be considered as equivalent ones , which significantly simplifies the numerical simulations .",
    "the above method can be applied to the investigation of the decay of mq nmr coherence intensities of different orders caused by the secular ddi in systems containing hundreds of spins . in the simplest case",
    "this decay occurs on the evolution period of the mq nmr experiment @xcite .",

    ", the decay takes place on the preparation period .    in this paper",
    "we study the decay of mq nmr coherence intensities created in systems with a large number of equivalent spins .",

    "the mq nmr experiment consists of four distinct periods of time ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) : preparation ( @xmath0 ) , evolution ( @xmath1 ) , mixing ( @xmath0 ) and detection .",

    ", the dynamics of spin system is described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "we consider two types of pulse sequences on the preparation period .",
    "the first one is the standard pulse sequence resulting in the averaged non - secular two - spin / two - quantum hamiltonian , describing the mq nmr dynamics on the preparation period of the standard mq nmr experiment @xcite , i.e. @xmath5 : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the coupling constant between spins @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath11 is the distance between spins @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath12 is the angle between the vectors @xmath13 and @xmath2 and @xmath14 are the raising and lowering operators of spin @xmath8 . the second type of pulse sequences is introduced in ref.@xcite , where a modification of the preparation period of the mq nmr experiment was suggested . in this case , the preparation period consists of the cycles of the duration @xmath15 and each cycle concatenates the short evolution period @xmath16 under the perturbation hamiltonian @xmath17 ( which is responsible for the secular ddi @xcite ) , @xmath18 with the evolution period @xmath19 under the ideal mq hamiltonian @xmath20 ( [ h ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath21 . introducing the relative strength @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) of the perturbation one can find that the resulting evolution can be described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath4 given by the following equation @xcite : @xmath24 let the preparation period consist of @xmath25 ( a big number ) cycles of the duration @xmath15 , so that one can introduce the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "note , that @xmath27 , which means that the standard preparation period , used , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , is a particular case of the described modification .",
    "hereafter we study the mq nmr dynamics of equivalent spins .",
    "such a case can be realized , for instance , by the dipolar coupling spins in a nanopore where the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is averaged ( but not to zero ) by the fast molecular diffusion @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath20 and @xmath28 with the averaged coupling constant @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) can be rewritten as follows @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the number of spins ) , @xmath34 and the operator @xmath35 is the square of the total spin angular momentum .",

    "these two cases are considered separately in secs.[section : first ] and [ section : second ] respectively .",
    "we consider the time evolution of the coherences in mq nmr experiments with the standard preparation period @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we take @xmath42 in eqs.([h_eff ] ) and ( [ h_ev ] ) , which read : @xmath44 so that the coherence decay occurs on the evolution period . in order to investigate the mq nmr dynamics of the system one should find the density matrix @xmath45 on the preparation period solving the liouville evolution equation @xcite @xmath46\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the initial thermodynamic equilibrium state @xmath47 in the high temperature approximation @xcite . taking into account the pointed information about the hamiltonians on the different periods of mq nmr experiment one can write the expression for the longitudinal polarization @xmath48 after the mixing period of mq nmr experiment ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the solution to eq.([l ] ) and @xmath51 .",
    "it is convenient to expand the spin density matrix @xmath45 in the series as follows @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the contribution to @xmath45 from mq coherence of the @xmath9th order and satisfies the following commutation relation @xcite : @xmath54 then eq.([i_z ] ) reads @xmath55 eq.([iz ] ) defines the intensity @xmath56 of the mq nmr coherence of order @xmath9 as follows : @xmath57 in analogy to the autocorrelation function for the decay of the transverse magnetization @xcite , eq.([j_n ] ) reveals the decay of mq nmr coherences due to the secular ddi on the evolution period . since we consider a system of equivalent spins , numerical simulation of eq.([j_n ] ) may be simplified allowing one to perform calculations in the systems with the large number of spins .",

    "these blocks correspond to different total spin numbers @xmath64 $ ] @xcite .",
    "all blocks are degenerated and their degeneracy @xmath65 is determined as follows @xcite : @xmath66 thus , the problem is reduced to the set of analogous problems of lower dimensions .",
    "the intensities of mq nmr coherences @xmath67 can be calculated for all blocks .",
    "then the observable intensities @xmath56 ( @xmath68 ) are following @xcite : @xmath69 the results of numerical simulations of these intensities are represented below .",
    "we study the dynamics of mq nmr coherence intensities in the nanopore filled with the spin - carring particles numerically .",
    "let us emphasize one more time that we are dealing with the highly symmetrical model where any two spins interact with the same constant of ddi because the diffusion characteristic time in the nanopore is much shorter then the spin flip - flop time @xcite .",
    "this fact simplifies the numerical calculations significantly since all particles are `` nearest neighbors '' in this model and we consider interactions among all of them .",
    "our calculations showed @xcite that mq nmr coherence intensities are quickly oscillating functions .",
    "for this reason we follow the strategy of ref .",
    "@xcite and consider the averaged intensities @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the dimensionless times associated with the preparation and evolution periods respectively , @xmath73 is the minimal eigenvalue of the @xmath60 hamiltonian .",
    "this value belongs to the block @xmath74 of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the choice of @xmath75 is motivated by the requirement that the coherences of all possible orders have appeared and one can think that the quasi - stationary distribution of the intensities is realized , which has been verified in ref.@xcite .",
    "the averaging is performed over two maximal periods @xmath76 of oscilations , which is taken from the requirement that the increase of the averaging interval does not change @xmath77 @xcite . the averaged intensities decay with the time @xmath78 of the evolution period .",
    "the time moments @xmath79 ( such that @xmath80 for an arbitrary @xmath9 ) versus mq coherence order in systems with 201 , 401 and 601 spins are shown in fig.[fig : exp12 ] .",
    "we can see from this figure that    1 .",
    "mq nmr coherence decay times decrease with the increase in the number of spins ; 2 .   mq nmr coherence decay times decrease with the increase in their order .",
    "the times @xmath81 of the decay of mq nmr coherences of order @xmath82 can be approximated by the hyperbolic cotangent , as it is shown in fig.[fig : exp12 ] : @xmath83 where parameters @xmath84 may be found by the least square method : @xmath85     the approximation given by eq.([coth ] ) shows that the decay rate of the high order coherence intensities is almost independent on their order .",
    "this happens because mq coherence phases ( acquired during the evolution period ) are approximately proportional to their order , see eq .",
    "( [ phi_com ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the rates of mq coherence decays increase with their order and the decay time @xmath81 is @xmath86 .",
    "thus , for the high order coherences , we have @xmath87 , i.e. the decay times of the @xmath9th and @xmath88th coherences are almost the same , which is reflected in eq.([coth ] ) .",
    "regarding the zero - order coherence , its intensity @xmath89 does not decay owing to the commutation relation @xmath90=0 $ ] , which follows from the fact that both @xmath41 ( [ h_dz ] ) and @xmath91 are diagonal in the chosen basis .",
    "it is worthwile to note that the dynamics of the multi - spin cluster growth during the evolution of the solid spin system considered , for instance , in @xcite is essentially different in comparison with that in the system of equivalent spins .",
    "the matter is that only the strongly interacting spins are joined in the clusters initially , usually the nearest neighbors in the crystal lattice @xcite .",
    "after that , the next neighbors become involved in the cluster and so on .",
    "thus more and more remote spins become embedded in the cluster with time . as a result , it becomes possible to observe the growth of the multi - spin clusters in mq nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamics of the spin clusters is quite different in the high symmetrical spin system such as the system of equivalent spins .",
    "all spins are `` nearest neighbors '' in this case , so that the spin cluster consisting of all @xmath33 spins is formed much more quickly during the time interval @xmath92 , where @xmath29 is the constant of ddi , which is the same for any two spins .",
    "it becomes hard to follow the process of the cluster growth in the high symmetrical system of equivalent spins , unlike the solids @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is some reorganization of the spin cluster diring the evolution , when the system is irradiated by the multipulse sequence @xcite , resulting to the high order mq coherences .",
    "now let us turn to the decay of mq nmr coherences .",
    "we consider the `` cluster '' of mq nmr coherences as a family of such coherences whose intensities exceed some fixed value @xmath93 , say , @xmath94 .",
    "this minimal value is taken since the smaller intensities are hardly observable in the experiment    .",
    "the size @xmath95 of the cluster of mq coherences does evolve , which is demonstrated in fig.[fig : exp13 ] .",
    "this evolution is a consequence of the fact that the rate of the decay increases with the increase in the order of mq nmr coherences .",
    "we see also that the rate of decrease of the coherence cluster size increases with the increase in @xmath33 .",
    "the described experiment may be used in order to prepare the coherence clusters of desirable size varying the duration of the evolution period .",
    "it is very important to investigate the degradation of quantum superposition states .",
    "nmr experiments @xcite allow us to make it .",
    "to this end the modification of the preparation period of the mq nmr experiment was suggested in ref.@xcite . in this section",
    "we consider eqs.([h_eff ] ) and ( [ h_ev ] ) with @xmath96 , so that the system is governed by the general hamiltonian @xmath4 during the preparation period and by the hamiltonian @xmath97 during the evolution period .",
    "thus the coherence decay occurs on the preparation period of the mq nmr experiment .",
    "the calculations analogous to those used for the derivation of eq.([j_n ] ) yield the following expression for the intensities of mq nmr coherences : @xmath98 where @xmath99    if @xmath100 , then it is simple to demonstrate that the intensities vary proportionally to @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , the liouville equation on the preparation period can be rewritten as follows : @xmath102.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solving eq.([l2 ] ) by the methods of the perturbation theory @xcite one can obtain @xmath103d\\tau',\\\\\\nonumber & & \\rho_2(\\tau)= \\int_0^{\\tau}d\\tau'\\int_0^{\\tau'}d\\tau''[e^{i\\bar h_{mq } ( \\tau'-\\tau)}(\\bar h_{dz}-\\\\\\nonumber & & \\bar h_{mq } )   e^{-i\\bar h_{mq } ( \\tau'- \\tau)},[e^{i\\bar h_{mq } ( \\tau''-\\tau)}(\\bar h_{dz}-\\\\\\nonumber & & \\bar h_{mq } )   e^{-i\\bar h_{mq } ( \\tau''- \\tau)},\\rho(\\tau)]],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the solution to eq.([l ] ) .",
    "it is evident from eq.([rho2 ] ) that @xmath104\\times \\\\\\nonumber & & [ e^{i\\bar h_{mq } ( \\tau''-\\tau)}(\\bar h_{dz}-\\bar h_{mq } )   e^{-i\\bar h_{mq } ( \\tau''- \\tau)},\\rho(\\tau)]\\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the behavior of the intensities with the increase in @xmath105 is defined by the sign of @xmath106 .",
    "we do not determine this sign for an arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "however , one has for small @xmath0 : @xmath107 ^ 2 > 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath108 is the sum of the intensities of mq nmr coherences for the standard mq nmr experiment and @xmath109 is the analogous sum , when the perturbations are taken into account one can conclude that the intensities decrease with the increase in the square of the perturbation strength at least for small @xmath0 , which is confirmed below by the numerical simulations .",
    "we refer to @xmath71 as the dimensionless evolution time in this section . before proceed to the numerical simulations ,",
    "let us underline the basic difference between the experiments considered in secs.[section : first ] and [ section : second ] .",
    "the matter is that the high frequency oscillations of mq nmr coherences are formed on the preparation period with the duration @xmath0 , while the decay of these coherences occurs on the evolution period ( with the duration @xmath1 ) in sec.[section : first ] . for this reason we consider the intensities averaged over the parameter @xmath0 in that section .",
    "however , the situation is different in sec.[section : second ] , because the decay occurs on the preparation period , so that the parameter @xmath0 is responsible for the both oscilations and decay of mq nmr coherences . because of this fact , we are not able to consider the averaged intensities . instead of this",
    ", we relate the decay time @xmath110 of the intensity @xmath111 with the decay times @xmath112 of its envelopes . here",
    "the subscript @xmath105 indicates that the parameter @xmath113 depends on the value of @xmath105 in the hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "parameters @xmath112 may be found simply by plotting the graphs of the envelopes @xmath114 of the quickly oscillating intensity @xmath111 , @xmath115 .",
    "then the decay times of the envelopes @xmath112 are the first zeros of @xmath114 appeared after the amplitude of the @xmath9th intensity gets its maximal value : @xmath116 .",
    "all this suggests us to calculate the decay time @xmath110 of the @xmath9th coherence as follows .",
    "first , we have to find numerically all solutions @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) to the equation @xmath119 , such that @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath121 be the number of such solutions .",
    "then the decay time of the @xmath9th coherence intensity may be found as the averaged value of these solutions : @xmath122 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath110 on the coherence number is shown in fig.[fig : exp21 ] for @xmath123 .",
    "it is found that this decay may be approximated as follows : @xmath124 .",
    "parameters @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 have been found by the least square method , see table i.    .the parameters of the approximation @xmath129 for the spin system with @xmath123 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : hpst1 ]     we see that the decay time of the high order coherence intensity depends slightly on its order in accordance with the represented formula .",
    "this conclusion is similar to that given in sec.[section : num_first ] , see eq.([coth ] ) .",
    "similar to sec.[section : num_first ] , we may introduce the cluster of mq coherences at any time moment @xmath130 as a family of such coherences that @xmath131 .",
    "evolution of the cluster size @xmath132 is shown in fig.[fig : exp22 ] for different @xmath33 and @xmath105 .",
    "we see that the results of our simulations agree qualitatively with the experimental ones obtained in @xcite .",
    "namely , there is the period of the coherence cluster growth @xmath133 @xcite and the period of the cluster decay , @xmath134 .",
    "fig.[fig : exp22 ] demonstrates that the cluster size gets its maximal value at the time moment @xmath135 , which is slightly dependent on the both parameters @xmath33 and @xmath105 .",
    "this confirms our assumptions that all spins become embedded in the cluster during the time interval @xmath136 , or @xmath137 .",
    "this feature of the cluster growth in the system of equivalent spins is different from that in solids @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : exp22 ] demonstrates also that the maximal size of the cluster increases with the increase in @xmath33 and slightly decreases with the increase in @xmath105 .",
    "the rate of the cluster decay increases with the increase in both @xmath33 and @xmath105 .",
    "comparison of figs.[fig : exp13 ] and [ fig : exp22 ] shows that the case of the modified preparation period is more flexible in preparation of the coherence clusters with the desirable size because of the parameter @xmath105 which does not appear in sec.[section : first ] .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that the appearance of mq nmr coherences and their relaxation are determined by the same ddi , which is valid in the models both suggested in @xcite and considered in the previous sections .",
    "this leads to some peculiarities of the relaxation process .",
    "we show that the sum of areas of the signals of mq nmr coherences in the frequency domain is not changed in the relaxation process although their maximal amplitudes decrease . for the sake of simplicity , we turn to the case considered in sec.[section : first ] , where the decay occurs on the evolution period",
    ". then the intensities of mq nmr coherences are determined by eq.([j_n ] ) . performing the fourier transform of the intensities @xmath56 of eq.([j_n ] ) over the time @xmath1 of the evolution period ( we suppose that @xmath138 for @xmath139 and @xmath140 , where @xmath76 is the duration of the evolution period ) @xmath141 one can find that the area @xmath142 under @xmath143 in the frequency domain is @xmath144 then the sum of the areas @xmath145 for all mq nmr coherences can be expressed as follows",
    ": @xmath146 however , it is known that @xmath147 @xcite . thus , eq.([a ] ) means that the areas @xmath142 are redistributing during the relaxation process so that their sum is conserved .",
    "similarly , replacing @xmath1 with @xmath105 and @xmath76 with @xmath148 in eqs.([f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) one derives the same conservation law for mq nmr experiment of sec.[section : second ] .",
    "the results of this section demonstrate some peculiarities of the used relaxation model .",
    "using the numerical methods describing the spin dynamics in large systems of equivalent spins @xcite , we study the decay of mq nmr coherences in such systems .",
    "this decay is caused by the hamiltonian @xmath41 appearing either on the preparation or evolution period of the mq nmr experiment .",
    "numerical simulations are performed for the systems consisting of 200 - 600 spins .",

    "we emphasize that the used model @xcite is the first one for the experimental investigation of the relaxation of the correlated spin clusters of the large size .",
    "it is worth to note that the evolution of the intensities of mq nmr coherences in the system of equivalent spins is accompanied by the reversion phenomena .",
