    "as a model for the interface we consider the unduloid , a family of constant mean curvature surfaces that appear in the study of soap films  @xcite .",
    "these have also been used to describe the pearling instability in fluid membrane tubes  @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "the unduloid surfaces have the convenient property that their geometry can be tuned continuously and rather simply from cylindrical to spherical .",
    "this family of surfaces is described by two parameters : @xmath0 which varies from @xmath1 for the cylinder to @xmath2 for a necklace of spheres , and the size scale @xmath3 which sets the radius of the cylinder at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath0 describe an undulated cylinder surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : unduloid ] ) . following ref .",
    "@xcite , the surface can be represented parametrically with a vector that maps @xmath5 , the coordinate along the cylinder axis , and @xmath6 , the azimuthal coordinate , to points on the interface between the charged and hydrophobic blocks , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 we see that @xmath10 is periodic as @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to note that , while @xmath3 describes the radius of the cylinders , the radii of the spheres at @xmath4 is @xmath12 .",
    "note that at small @xmath13 , the unduloid describes a simple sinusoidal modulation of the cylinder radius , @xmath14 in the case of soap films , unduloids are necessarily unstable due to their finite length .",
    "for diblock copolymers , however , we will see the situation is far more complicated .",
    "the free energy of polyelectroyte copolymer micelles is a sum of four terms , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the stretching energy of the chains in the core , @xmath17 is the interfacial energy between the core and dissolved brush domains , @xmath18 is the stretching energy of the brush , and @xmath19 is the contribution to the free energy from the charged groups on the chain and the ions in solution . in the remainder of this section we provide results and motivation for the expressions , leaving their detailed evaluation to the appendix .",
    "if the polymer block composing the core region is sufficiently hydrophobic , then the concentration of solvent in the core region is negligible and the chains in the core are in the molten state with constant density @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the techniques of self - consistent strong - segregation theory of diblock copolymers in a melt can be applied @xcite . in the strong - segregation limit ,",
    "the width interface between domains is small compared to the size of the domains , and the free energy can be expressed in terms of the geometry of the interface . to this end",
    "we employ the `` wedge model '' of milner and olmsted  @xcite in which we partition the core region  contained by the unduloid surface  into a series of wedges small enough so that all chains within effectively experience a single , fixed geometry .",
    "the total stretching free energy is computed by , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes an integral over the volume of the core domain , appropriately apportioned into infinitesimal wedges , @xmath23 is the distance along the chain trajectory to the interface , @xmath20 is the density of monomers in the core , @xmath24 is the molecular weight of the chains in the core and @xmath25 is the kuhn length .",
    "we assume that the chains meet the interface along the surface normal .",
    "one advantage of using the unduloid representation of the interface rather than a cylinder with a cosine modulation of the radius is that , for all values of @xmath0 , the chain paths do not cross , allowing us to follow the transition all the way from the cylinder morphology at @xmath26 to a chain of spheres at @xmath4 .",
    "we show in the appendix that the stretching energy per chain can be put into the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of chains , @xmath29 is the dimensionless volume of the micelle core , @xmath30 is the core volume , and @xmath31 is the dimensionless stretching energy for the chains in the core . since this term represents the entropic cost of confining a chain within a brush , the free energy simply scales as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the unperturbed radius of gyration of the polymer block .    at the interface between the core and dissolved brush domains ,",
    "the hydrophobic block is exposed to solvent , as well as the polyelectrolyte block .",
    "assuming that the interface is sufficiently narrow , we can capture energetic cost of this exposure by introducing a free energy per unit area , or surface tension , @xmath34 .",
    "in general , such a surface tension will have a complicated dependence on the relative concentrations of solvent and polymer at the interface , free charge and salt concentration , _ etc . _ we will treat , @xmath34 , as an unknown phenomenological parameter effectively fixed for a given system at constant temperature . the interfacial energy per chain is then given by @xmath35 where @xmath34 is the surface tension ( in units of @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 is the interface area , and @xmath38 the dimensionless area of the unduloid surface .      in the limit that the concentration of free ions ( both counter ions and salt ions ) in the brush is large ,",
    "the primary effect of these free charges is to maintain electroneutrality @xcite . in this limit , the so - called  osmotic - brush \" regime ,",
    "the stretching of the chains is balanced by the entropy of the counterions confined to the brush , and the counterions locally neutralize the charge on the chains @xcite . in the present calculation",
    ", we consider chains that are equally - stretched  @xcite , and neglect polymer trajectory fluctuations .",
    "the latter approximation can be justified in the low - salt limit and the limit of large polyelectrolyte block monomer number , @xmath39 .",
    "fluctuations of chain path around the mean trajectory have characteristic size , @xmath40 , while simple scaling considerations show that in the low - salt limit the brush height grows as @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the asymptotic , large @xmath39 limit , such fluctuations can be ignored .",
    "further , jusufi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have found that these these approximations lead to reasonable quantitative agreement with simulations for star polymers because the osmotic pressure of the counterions lead to highly stretched chains .",
    "however , their model includes two effects which we neglect here : ( 1 ) the condensation of counterions , which we simply absorb into a redefinition of the fraction of charged monomers , @xmath42 , and ( 2 ) the impartial neutralization of the brush due to the escape of counterions to solution .",
    "a schematic of the chain model is shown is figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "we assume a brush height , @xmath43 , and gaussian chains with stretching energy @xmath44 where for simplicity we take the kuhn length of the polyelectrolyte block to be , @xmath25 , as it is for the insoluble block .    to allow for appropriate generality",
    ", we introduce into our _ ansatz _ another parameter @xmath45 which describes the average direction of the chains in the brush , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the unit normal of the interface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) . in the regions of high negative mean curvature ,",
    "the density of chains , and hence the osmotic pressure , is much larger than the rest of the brush .",
    "since charged brushes do not typically overlap  @xcite , we can allow the configurations to relax away from overlap in two ways .",
    "one on hand , the chains trajectories can tip radially away from the high density region , as is described by a @xmath48 configuration .",
    "we could further allow the brush to compress by imposing a sinusoidal variation of the brush height , @xmath49 .",
    "for configurations without overlap , we set @xmath50 , and otherwise , we choose the smallest @xmath51 such that the brush does not overlap .",
    "indeed , we find over a large range of parameters the free energy favors uncompressed states , with @xmath52 . by suitably rescaling @xmath18 , the dimensionless corona stretching per chain ,",
    "@xmath53 $ ] , can be defined as @xmath54}{{{\\cal v}}(\\epsilon)},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the height of the brush measured in units of the core size .",
    "finally , we assume that each chain has a fraction @xmath42 of charged monomers equally distributed along the chain .",
    "that is , we assume that the charge distribution is quenched . the counterion contribution to the free energy is then  @xcite @xmath56,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the position - dependent concentration of positive and negative ions , @xmath58 is the concentration of ions in bulk solution , and the integral is over the volume of the brush .",
    "the mean - field counterion densities should , properly , come from solving the poisson - boltzmann equation for the charge distribution described by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the local concentration of monomer in the brush which depends on the brush geometry ( see appendix ) . to derive this expression ,",
    "we have assumed local electroneutrality , @xmath61  @xcite , which is valid in the osmotic regime  @xcite . from the poisson - boltzmann equation",
    ", we also have the relation @xmath62 for a @xmath63 electrolyte .",
    "this allows us to derive expressions for the ion concentrations in terms of @xmath64 and @xmath58 : @xmath65 strictly speaking , we are considering the limit of the poisson - boltmann theory in the limit that the debye screening length , @xmath66 , is small compared to brush dimensions @xcite .",
    "this is valid for the case when the concentration of free charge ( counterions and salt ) in the brush is sufficiently large .",
    "we note that the expression for the osmotic pressure used in a similar mean - field calculation for polyelectrolyte copolymers by borisov and zhulina @xcite can be obtained by taking the @xmath67 limit of the above expressions .",
    "in general , one expects that some fraction of the counterions will be condensed onto the chains  we can absorb this into a redefinition of the fraction of charged monomers @xmath42 and assume that @xmath42 does not change overly much when the interface geometry changes .",
    "additionally , some fraction of the counterions will escape the corona , an effect we also ignore in our approximations .",
    "this will lead to region near the edge of the brush which is non - neutral .",
    "however , we expect that the size of such a region will be proportional to the electrostatic screening length , which is small compared to the brush size .",
    "it seems doubtful that these approximations will change the overall qualitative conclusions of this paper , though they are likely to play a quantitative role in some aspects of our calculation .",
    "this will be discussed where appropriate in the following .",
    "given the energetics described here we obtain mean - field results by minimizing the free energy per chain over unconstrained parameters .",
    "for the case of the equilibrium calculations discussed below , we minimize all free parameters .",
    "the counterion free energy density does not depend on the core size @xmath3 , allowing us to minimize over @xmath3 analytically , only on the ratio of brush height to core size , @xmath68 .",
    "we retain three parameters to be minimized over numerically : the brush height @xmath69 , the undulation parameter @xmath0 , and the brush chain direction @xmath45 .",
    "this gives us @xmath70 \\}},\\ ] ] where @xmath71 .",
    "we computed mean - field phase diagrams for  crew - cut \" ( @xmath72 ) , symmetric ( @xmath73 ) and  hairy \" ( @xmath74 ) micelles .",
    "the free - energy minimization was performed for fixed charge fraction , @xmath42 , and salt concentration , @xmath58 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath75 , and we consider copolymers composed of @xmath76 monomers per chain , roughly equivalent to the experiments of bendejacq _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "we set the surface tension to @xmath77 and find that hairy micelles ( @xmath72 ) are computed to have core radii in the range of 5 to 10 nm ( assuming @xmath78 5  ) , which is in good agreement with the experimental observations of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the phase behavior for hairy micelles ( @xmath72 ) as a function of charge fraction @xmath42 and dimensionless salt concentration @xmath79",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagramf0p3 ] . the free energy per chain of cylindrical and spherical micelles are equal along the dashed line . at high salt and low polymer charge cylindrical micelles",
    "are stable , while at low salt and high charge spherical micelles become stable .",
    "however , cylindrical micelles that persist into the stability region of spheres become unstable to undulation .",
    "these undulations are driven by the frustration induced by the counterions , which prefer interfaces with positive gaussian curvature in order to increase their free volume . however",
    ", this tendency toward the formation of spheres must be balanced by the significant increase in free ion concentration in the regions of negative gaussian curvature which is only partially mitigated by the migration of chains toward the positive curvature region ( i.e. surface density of chains is reduced in the saddle regions ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] for a schematic description ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the undulated cylinder shape is _",
    "metastable_.    in figure [ fig : epvsalpha ] we plot @xmath13 and @xmath45 as function of @xmath80 for fixed salt concentration ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "when the cylinders first become unstable at low charge fraction , the undulated cylinders have eccentricities on the order of @xmath82 and @xmath83 so that the chains are almost nearly directed normal to the interface . as the charge fraction",
    "is increased , the increased osmotic pressure within the brush increases its height ( see fig . [",
    "fig : epvsalpha ] ) .",
    "this effect leads to an increase in the monomer and counterion concentration in the negative curvature regions .",
    "the subsequent rise in osmotic pressure leads to a tendency of the chain trajectories to tip toward the radial direction .",
    "once @xmath45 decreases to zero and the brush chains extend radially from the cylinder axis , the counterions no longer gain any entropy from the extra interfacial curvature of the unduloid .",
    "in fact , the core free energies , the core stretching and interfacial energy , are minimal for the @xmath84 cylindrical state . and since the brush free energy is not lower for an unduloid state with @xmath85 than the @xmath84 state , @xmath13 decreases back to 0 for large @xmath80 .",
    "the boundary of the undulated cylinder region at high charge fraction is determined by the condition @xmath26 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : epvsalpha ] ) .    the phase behavior of symmetric ( @xmath73 ) and crew - cut ( @xmath74 )",
    "micelles is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : symphase ] and  [ fig : crewphase ] respectively , and is very similar to the hairy case . as we progress toward the crew - cut limit , the cs transition moves toward larger charge fractions and lower salt concentrations .",
    "this may be due to the core energy which prefers cylindrical micelles over spheres and is dominated by the interfactial term , ( [ eq : int ] ) , becomes more important as the size of the core block , @xmath24 , increases . as the core chain length increases , the undulated cylinder behavior no longer disappears at large charge fraction for @xmath86 . as in the case of hairy micelles , however , spheres become energetically favorable well before the uc region in both cases .",
    "given our model for the free energy of micelles constructed from the unduloid surfaces , we build an _ ansatz _ for the shapes of the ends to micelles of cylindrical micelles from consider piecewise constant mean curvature surfaces .",
    "this is done by `` gluing '' two unduloids quarter - periods and a spherical hemisphere to the end of a cylinder with radius @xmath3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : endansatz ] ) .",
    "one of the unduloid pieces changes radius from @xmath3 to @xmath87 , the neck radius .",
    "the second piece increases the radius from @xmath87 to the spherical cap radius , @xmath88 .",
    "since we assume that the micelles are effectively infinite , the end pieces can increase in volume by pulling chains from the infinite cylindrical portion , and thus , raise or lower the energy of that particular chain relative to its energy in the cylinder .",
    "thus , to compute the free energy of these ends we consider that the ends are in contact with an infinite source of polymer chains at fixed chemical potential , which is set by the free energy per chain of the infinite cylindrical state .",
    "the cylinder radius , @xmath3 , is set to the equilibrium value of an infinite cylinder , and we minimize the free energy of the end over all remaining unconstrained parameters .",
    "many of the features of the characteristic end shapes can be explained by considering the free energy per chain in different geometries . in the region of cylinder stability ( at low charge and high salt ) , chains in the endcap have a higher free energy than those in the bulk cylinder , and therefore preferentially migrate into the cylinder region .",
    "this has the effect of decreasing the radius of the spherical endcap , @xmath88 , giving the appearance of the interface at @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig : endshape ] . in the spherical stability regime ( at high charge and low salt ) , we find that the endcap , @xmath88 , is generically larger than the cylinder radius , @xmath3 . since in this regime the free energy of chains within the spherical bulges is lower than for chains with the cylindrical portion , chains preferentially migrate toward the spherical cap , increasing the radius of end cap , @xmath88 .",
    "to best approximate the preferred spherical geometry , the neck radius @xmath87 , pinches down to well below @xmath3 .",
    "this procedure yields a spherical cap radius @xmath88 very close to the ideal spherical micelle size .",
    "this characteristic  bulbous \" end shape has been widely observed in a number of polymeric micelle systems @xcite , and is similar to the ends conjectured to appear in the context of bicontinuous phases of emulsions  @xcite . however , despite the preference for a spherical micelle configuration indicated by these bulbous end shapes , the free energy always has a minimum at finite neck size .",
    "indeed , the high osmotic pressure induced by the large ion concentration in the saddle regions of the charged brush domain lead to sizable energy barriers to `` pinching off '' ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "these barriers are discussed in detail below .",
    "since undulated cylinders are a metastable state , we consider here the free energy barriers governing the eventual breakup of the micelles into spheres .",
    "diblock copolymer kinetics is a subject of ongoing theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite research . since diblocks in solvent are the polymeric equivalent of amphiphilic surfactants , it is instructive to compare the kinetics of their respective micellar distributions . in surfactants ,",
    "there is a substantial fraction of free molecules and the primary kinetic mechanism for morphological changes is the aniansson - wall ( aw ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the exchange of single surfactant molecules ( unimers ) from micelle to bulk solution is fast enough to allow the direct formation of spheres and the subsequent depletion of molecules from cylindrical to spherical micelles . in the higher molecular weight copolymers , however ,",
    "the concentration of free chains is significantly suppressed @xcite and , consequently , the aw unimer exchange mechanism is drastically slowed @xcite . instead , dormidontova has found that fission - fusion events of micelles likely play a significant role in the relaxation kinetics of copolymers solutions  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the kinetic pathway connecting cylindrical and spherical micelle distributions may be dominated by states of fixed polymer number and intermediate interfacial geometry , such as undulated cylinders @xcite .",
    "we turn our attention to the calculation of the free energy barriers for the fission of a cylindrical ( or undulated ) micelle end into spherical micelles .",
    "our end shape _",
    "ansatz _ allows us to compute the energetic barrier for budding a sphere from the end of a cylindrical micelle by continuously tuning the neck size , @xmath87 .",
    "a schematic free energy plot for this pathway is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : budpath ] .",
    "we consider a pathway which is divided into three stages : ( 1 ) contraction of the neck radius , ( 2 ) scission of the neck , and ( 3 ) bud relaxation .",
    "while , in principle , we could imagine a pathway in which @xmath87 contracts continuously to zero ( or at least some molecular size ) , we find that allowing for neck scission lowers the over barrier considerably . therefore , once the neck size has decreased below some critical size , the bud neck breaks , thereby exposing an area of the core @xmath91 to solution . at the point of neck scission , we estimate the cost of exposing core monomers to solution as @xmath34 , the interfacial surface tension , times the exposed surface area . to compute the minimum energy pathway within our _ ansatz _",
    "we minimize the free energy barrier , @xmath92 , over this critical neck radius .",
    "our calculation for the barrier height for end fission of spherical micelle from a cylinder end is plotted in figure [ fig : barrier ] for hairy micelles ( @xmath72 ) and for low salt ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath92 _ decreases _ for increased @xmath42 .",
    "when @xmath42 is small , the barrier heights can be quite large ( thousands of @xmath36 ) . for larger",
    "@xmath42 , however , the barrier heights fall precipitously to tens or hundreds of @xmath36 . in comparison to the case neutral copolymer melts  @xcite , the free energy barriers computed here are quite large , up to 1000 times larger .    a simple consideration of the free energy scale set by the brush free energy shows that the excluded volume interaction induced by the brush electrostatics should indeed lead to free energy barriers of this magnitude .",
    "while excluded volume effects are screened in molten polymer brushes , the cs transition is frustrated by the increased osmotic pressure in the neck region of the end bud .",
    "typically , such an end bud will contain @xmath94 polymer chains , and each of those chains entrains @xmath95 counter ions within the dissolved brush .",
    "given that each of those counterions represents roughly @xmath36 worth of free energy due to the entropy lost in confinement , it is then not surprising that such a topological transition could cost thousands of @xmath36 .",
    "nonetheless , we see from figure [ fig : barrier ] that changing the effective charge of the polyelectrolyte block can _ decrease _ the barrier at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "the qualitative explanation of this effect is simple . as @xmath80 increases",
    ", the equilibrium size of the micelles decreases , indicating that fewer chains comprise the micelle ends , leading to an overall decrease in @xmath92 .",
    "the barrier heights for hairy micelles are plotted on a log - log scale in figure  [ fig : logbarrier ] for a number of different salt concentrations .",
    "we find two characteristic regimes of power law behavior , one at low charging and one at high charging . at high salt concentration and large @xmath42",
    ", we find that the barrier height decreases as @xmath96 . in this regime ,",
    "the decrease in neck radius @xmath87 is small and the free energy barrier is dominated by direct scission . here",
    ", the dependence on @xmath42 comes directly from the equlilibrium scaling of the cylinder radius with @xmath80 at high salt in the limit @xmath97 , @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "largely , we expect the equilibrium neck radius to scale with @xmath3 , therefore , direct scission predicts a free energy barrier , @xmath99 , which yields the observed power law .",
    "we have developed a free energy expression for diblock copolymer cylinders with a hydrophobic block and a charged corona , and used this to understand the stability of various axisymmetric structures .",
    "we use a family of constant mean curvature surfaces called unduloids to parametrize possible interfaces from cylinder to a necklace of spheres . this _",
    "ansatz _ allows us to probe the full , non - linear dependence of the free energy on the micelle surface geometry .",
    "our results indicate that there is a metastable undulated cylinder phase , as observed in experiments  @xcite which occurs generically in parameter ranges where the free energy per chain for spherical micelles is lower still .",
    "we have studied the shape of the spherical endcaps and found , in particular , that in the regime in which cylinders are stable , the ends show a distinct decrease in radius below the equilibrium value . when spherical micelles are preferred in equilibrium , the spherical cap radius is larger than the cylinder radius  and is close to the preferred spherical micelle size .",
    "we use these results to compute dependence the free energy barriers for budding spherical micelles from cylindrical micelles on polymer charge , @xmath80 , and solution salt concentration , @xmath58 .",
    "our calculation of the free energy is variational and therefore our values for the free energy barrier to budding , @xmath92 , necessarily provide upper bounds . however , certain conclusions from this study are robust . indeed , these results along with the fact that the aw step - wise kinetic mechanism is suppressed in polymeric systems @xcite strongly support the suggestion that distributions of polymer micelles in selective solvent  non - ergodic , \" with micelles essentially trapped within a fixed , quenched topology @xcite .",
    "in contrast with neutral copolymer solutions , however , we find here a strong , tunable dependence of barrier height on polymer charge and salt concentration .",
    "kramers kinetic theory predicts that the cs transition rate , @xmath100 should depend on the the free energy as @xmath101 @xcite . at small @xmath42 , the cs pathway investigated here",
    "is kinetically arrested by large barrier heights . supposing the aw unimer exchange mechanism is also sufficiently slow , these large barrier heights suggest that the metastable undulated cylinder regime may be observed .",
    "such undulated cylinders have been observed experimentally in a number of amphiphilic polymeric systems , both charged and uncharged  @xcite . at large @xmath80 and low @xmath58",
    ", @xmath92 may fall to sufficiently low values that the transition to spherical micelles may proceed on experimental time scales .",
    "this suggests that the observed `` phase boundary '' between cylindrical and spherical micelles in ref .",
    "@xcite , may reflect that fact that these kinetic barriers depend quite strongly on @xmath80 and @xmath58 .",
    "given that @xmath92 varies by two orders of magnitude , we expect an extremely sharp dependence of the @xmath100 on @xmath80 and @xmath58 over the same parameter range .",
    "the geometry of self - assembled structures is often cast in terms of constant mean curvature ( cmc ) surfaces  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the energy of any interface can be expanded in powers of the curvature , resulting in the helfrich energy , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the total micelle interfacial area , @xmath104 is the mean curvature , @xmath105 is the gaussian curvature , @xmath106 is the spontaneous curvature , which comes from the molecular asymmetry of the chains and the corona - solvent interaction .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is the surface tension .",
    "finally , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are effective bending rigidities for the mean and gaussian curvatures respectively , which must be derived from a microscopic model . for @xmath109 ,",
    "this energy describes the shape of soap bubbles , and cmc surfaces minimize the energy in this limit . in the context of diblock copolymers",
    "@xcite or fluid membrane shapes @xcite , the additional curvature terms modify the shape and stability of various structures .",
    "higher order curvature terms are typically neglected as being subleading , but we will show equation ( [ eq : helfrich ] ) fails to describe our results , even qualitatively , without them .    we restrict ourselves to interfaces belonging to the unduloid family of surfaces capped at both ends .",

    "the only dependence on @xmath0 comes from the volume and area of the interface ( recall that @xmath116 does not change with @xmath0 ) which , at fixed @xmath3 , is minimum for @xmath117 no matter the value of spontaneous curvature .",
    "this reflects the fact that spheres minimize the area for a fixed volume , and indeed , this is a manifestation of the well - known rayleigh instability of fluid interfaces @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous curvature only sets the overall size scale of the micelles , not their topology .",
    "we conclude that higher order curvature terms to equation ( [ eq : helfrich ] ) are required to understand the local stability of undulated cylinders in terms of universal geometrical measures of the block interface  @xcite .",
    "this is , perhaps , not surprising since higher order corrections introduce length scales on the order of @xmath3 for axisymmetric shapes  @xcite . in the case of vesicles , where equation ( [ eq : helfrich ] ) is known to apply ,",

    "<S> self - assembly in diblock copolymers is driven by two competing effects : the immiscibility of the two blocks drives their phase separation , yet the connectivity of the blocks prevents a true macroscopic phase separation . even in the simplest case of copolymer melts , this competition leads to the formation of a variety of generic structures , including spherical and cylindrical micelles , lamellae and bicontinuous gyroid phase  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the selection of these various morphologies is determined by a balance of surface tension between microphase separated regions and the chain stretching of the polymers and can , in certain cases , be analyzed purely from the point of view of the interfacial geometry  @xcite .    in selective solvents , on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of copolymer structures is also affected by solvent - polymer interactions , widening the both the range of possible structures and the ability to control morphological transitions by tuning the solvent conditions . moreover , in solution , the volume - filling constraints of the molten state are relaxed . in this way , </S>",

    "<S> , this focus is due to the fact the self - assembly in polyelectrolyte copolymer solutions has been well characterized experimentally @xcite . while similar experiments have address the morphological transition between wormlike micelles and spheres for neutral block copolymers  @xcite , the added control provided by modulating the charge and salt conditions of the polyelectrolyte domains allow for a systematic investigation of , in particular , the cylinder to sphere ( cs ) transition . </S>",

    "<S> we develop a mean - field model for diblock copolymer micelles with interfacial geometry between straight cylinders and individual spheres . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , this can be realized by first forming the cylinders , then changing solvent conditions to frustrate the geometry toward the formation of spherical micelles , as was the method in the experiments of ref . </S>",

    "<S> , we construct a class of micellar morphologies whose geometry can be continuously varied from cylindrical to spherical and compute the free energy within a variational , mean - field scheme . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that under certain salt and charge conditions , cylindrical micelles become unstable to the formation of undulated cylinders . </S>",

    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite must indicate a large kinetic barrier to the breakup of undulated cylinders to spheres . </S>",
    "<S> our model allows us to calculate an upper bound on the free - energy barrier for fission of a cylinder into spheres , and we find a strong dependence of the barrier height on salt concentration of the solution and the effective charge of the polyelectrolyte blocks . </S>",
    "<S> combined these calculations enable us qualitatively to understand the `` phase diagram '' observed in reference  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> our approach is to construct the simplest possible model for the energetics of undulated cylinders that contains the essential physics . in this spirit </S>",
