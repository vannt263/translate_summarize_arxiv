    "information flow from unauthorized access is of vital importance for today s applications .",
    "the concept of information secrecy however is not new and dates back to the pioneering work of shannon @xcite .",
    "shannon considered a strong notion of secrecy requiring essentially that the eavesdropper s received signal be independent of the communicated message . under",
    "this constraint shannon showed that the transmitter must share a private key with the legitimate receiver whose entropy is at least as large as the message s entropy .",
    "this negative result lead to the development of modern cryptographic systems whose objective is not to provide strong secrecy but rather to make security breaches computationally prohibitive .",
    "these encryption algorithms are employed today in most systems where secrecy is required .",
    "this wide deployment , however , should not obscure the fact that these methods do not offer strong security guarantees . information - theoretical security can provide such guarantees and as such has attracted considerable attention lately",
    ".    the pessimistic result of shannon is due to the implicit assumption that the eavesdropper observes the same signal as the legitimate receiver . in his celebrated paper @xcite",
    ", wyner challenged this assumption by introducing the wiretap channel , a channel in which an eavesdropper observes a degraded version of the signal received by the legitimate receiver .",
    "wyner also considered a different notion of secrecy which requires that asymptotically the equivocation of the eavesdropper about the transmitted message should converge to the message s entropy . with this new framework , and for discrete memoryless channels ( dmcs ) , wyner gave a complete description of the tradeoff between the information rate at the legitimate receiver and the information leaked to the eavesdropper .",
    "wyner showed that for a dmc there exists an intrinsic quantity called the _ secrecy capacity _ which gives the maximum information rate that can be reliably transmitted to the legitimate receiver with zero leakage of information to the eavesdropper .",
    "since then , the wiretap channel has become one of the core topics in information theoretic security and several results are available today .",
    "csiszar and korner @xcite extended wyner s study to nondegraded dmcs .",
    "the degraded gaussian wiretap channel was studied in @xcite .",
    "multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) gaussian wiretap channels have been the subject of an extensive interest lately @xcite-@xcite .",
    "wiretap channels in the presence of fading have been also investigated in @xcite-@xcite ( and the references therein ) .",
    "the results of @xcite show that a non - zero secrecy capacity requires that the legitimate receiver s channel be less noisy than the eavesdropper s . for rf channels , however ,",
    "this is difficult to guarantee in practice due to the possibility of multipath fading . indeed , even if the legitimate receiver is closer to the transmitter than the eavesdropper is , the legitimate receiver may still have a weaker channel due to fading .",
    "moreover , since the fading state is a sensitive function of the position of the receivers , it is difficult to predict the degree of fading experienced by the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper given imperfect information about their locations .",
    "one possible solution to this problem is to use optical or near - optical frequencies instead of rf . for optical wireless systems ,",
    "the detector is usually multiple orders of magnitude larger than the wavelength of the transmitted beam , which provides natural immunity against multipath fading via spatial diversity  @xcite .",
    "this immunity makes predictions about the quality of the legitimate receiver s and the eavesdropper s signal based on their position more accurate .",
    "in fact , with the multipath problem gone , the only major channel impairment remaining is the pathloss which can be safely assumed to be higher for the eavesdropper if the legitimate receiver can guarantee that he is closer to the transmitter .",
    "another advantage of optical communications over rf is that the transmitted signal is highly directional , making interception by a malevolent third party more difficult .",
    "this should be contrasted with the relatively - omnidirectional nature of rf transmissions , for which the signal is broadcasted over a wide angle .",
    "yet another advantage of wireless optical communication is the spatial confinement of the transmitted optical signal .",
    "indeed , at optical wavelengths , the transmitted signal is absorbed by the atmosphere and beyond a certain range it becomes undetectable .",
    "this is desirable from a security standpoint as an eavesdropper located beyond this range is literally kept in the dark .",
    "all of these features give wireless optical communications a clear advantage for security .",
    "this technology is already being deployed in the form of infrared communications @xcite-@xcite , and ultraviolet ( uv ) systems are currently under development @xcite-@xcite . however , despite the numerous benefits that this technology offers , coding is still needed for those scenarios in which the channel itself does not provide absolute secrecy , such as when the beam of light is reflected or scattered by solid objects , dust or water droplets @xcite .",
    "although in this case the signal has been degraded , an eavesdropper could still gain valuable information .",
    "we examine the fundamental limits of coding for secure communication over optical channels by studying the secrecy capacity of the poisson channel , a common model for direct detection optical communications systems . in such systems",
    "the transmitter sends information by modulating the intensity of an optical signal while the receiver observes the arrival moments of individual photons .",
    "the capacity of this channel has been determined under peak power constraint on the transmitted optical power by kabanov @xcite and under both average and peak power constraint by davis @xcite .",
    "wyner @xcite derived the reliability function of this channel for all rates below capacity and constructed exponentially optimal codes .",
    "multiple - access poisson channels were studied in @xcite-@xcite whereas broadcast poisson channels were considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the capacity of the poisson channel has been also investigated in the presence of fading @xcite .",
    "we study in this paper the degraded poisson wiretap channel .",
    "the legitimate receiver observes a doubly stochastic poisson process with instantaneous rate @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the signal transmitted .",
    "the eavesdropper s observation is also a doubly stochastic poisson process with instantaneous rate @xmath2 .",
    "for degradedness we assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in theorem 1",
    "we provide a closed form expression of the secrecy capacity as a function of the parameters @xmath5 .",
    "this result is further extended by theorem 5 which gives a full characterization of the rate equivocation region .",
    "our achievability proof uses stochastic encoding as well as the structured codes constructed by wyner for the poisson channel @xcite . as for the converse",
    ", we will see that the infinite bandwidth nature of the poisson channel makes it possible to prove the converse using only simple properties of the conditional expectation combined with basic information theoretical inequalities .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the converse of the ( finite bandwidth ) gaussian channel which is proved using the entropy power inequality ( epi ) . as an illustration for the basic ideas that underpin the converse for the poisson channel , we will start by considering here the more familiar infinite bandwidth gaussian channel and we will see also that for this channel the proof of the converse simplifies considerably .    for this purpose , consider the continuous time gaussian wiretap channel with bandwidth @xmath6 ( later we will let @xmath6 tend to infinity ) and with a power constraint @xmath7 .",
    "this continuous time channel is equivalent to @xmath8 uses per second of the discrete time gaussian channel depicted in fig .",
    "the input signal is power constrained , i.e. , @xmath9\\leq p$ ] , the legitimate receiver observes @xmath10 and the eavesdropper receives @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "define @xmath14 by @xmath15 and observe that @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath18 and @xmath19=0 $ ] , it follows therefore that @xmath20 ( since they are jointly gaussian ) . for the discrete time gaussian wiretap channel",
    ", it is known that the secrecy capacity is given by @xmath21 . for the continuous time channel counterpart with bandwidth @xmath6 ,",
    "the secrecy capacity becomes @xmath22 .    in @xcite , using the celebrated epi , a closed form expression for the secrecy capacity of the discrete time gaussian wiretap channel was obtained . in just a few steps",
    ", we will see that the secrecy capacity of the infinite bandwidth ( @xmath23 ) gaussian wiretap channel can be found much more simply . starting with ( [ gaussian ] ) we obtain the following sequence of inequalities @xmath24 inequality @xmath25 follows from the data processing inequality , equalities in @xmath26 and @xmath27 are standard information theory identities , @xmath28 follows from the independence bound on entropy and finally @xmath29 holds because @xmath30 and @xmath31 are conditionally independent given @xmath32 ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) . basically ,",
    "the key identity needed to go from @xmath25 to @xmath27 is the following : if @xmath34 , then we have @xmath35 .",
    "a proof of this simple inequality in a more general setting will be given later and will be used in part of the converse for the poisson channel .",
    "going back to the gaussian problem , we see that @xmath36 for a fixed bandwidth @xmath6 , this last inequality is not tight . now letting @xmath23 we obtain @xmath37 however , since @xmath38",
    ", we also have that @xmath39 it follows that @xmath40 .",
    "this remarkably simple approach will be particularly useful for the poisson channel . more specifically ,",
    "when @xmath41 , the eavesdropper s signal @xmath42 is a thinned version of the legitimate receiver s signal @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 where @xmath45 , the approach above gives that @xmath46 . since @xmath47 is itself a doubly stochastic poisson process ,",
    "the mutual information @xmath48 can be maximized using the martingale techniques of kabanov @xcite and an ( achievable ) upperbound can be obtained on @xmath49 . when @xmath50 , a different bounding technique using only simple properties of the conditional expectation will be devised .    although no  sophisticated \" tools are required to prove the converse , we show in the appendix that using some new results in information theory an alternative proof can be provided .",
    "this different proof hinges on the link that has been established between the mutual information ( mi ) and the minimum mean square estimation ( mmse ) in poisson channels @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that the link between the mi and the mmse in the gaussian setting @xcite has been also used recently for different gaussian wiretap channels @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of the distinctive aspects in this paper is that we do not resort to the @xmath51-discretization method introduced by wyner @xcite .",
    "this method was used to approximate the poisson channel by a binary dmc thereby allowing the transposition of the widely known results for dmcs to the poisson channel .",
    "this technique leads to extensive computations , especially when we are interested in the secrecy capacity as there are now two conflicting objectives involved , the maximization of the information rate at the legitimate receiver and the minimization of the information leakage at the eavesdropper .",
    "we circumvent the use of this method by using the techniques described above .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section describes the setup of the problem and presents the main result of this paper as well as some interpretations of the obtained result .",
    "the proof of the achievability of the secrecy capacity is given in section iii and the proof of the converse is presented in section iv . in section",
    "v we extend the main result of the paper by giving a complete characterization of the rate - equivocation region . finally , in section vi , some possible future directions are discussed .",
    "the input process to the poisson channel is a waveform denoted by @xmath52 satisfying @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .",
    "we further assume that the input process is peak power limited , i.e. , @xmath55 for all @xmath54 .",
    "the received signal at the legitimate receiver @xmath56 is a doubly stochastic poisson process with instantaneous rate @xmath0 , i.e. , given @xmath57 the stochastic process @xmath56 has independent increments with @xmath58 and for @xmath59 we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 the parameter @xmath62 accounts for possible signal attenuation at the receiver .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 is the dark current intensity which results from background noise and bears no information on the input process @xmath57 . similarly the output process of the eavesdropper @xmath64 is a doubly stochastic poisson process with instantaneous rate @xmath2 .    in this paper ,",

    "lapidoth et al .",
    "@xcite gave conditions on the parameters @xmath5 for stochastic degradedness .",
    "these conditions are presented in the following lemma . in order to prepare for the results to come we will also briefly go over the proof of this lemma .",
    "the eavesdropper s channel is stochastically degraded with respect to the legitimate receiver s channel , if @xmath76 and @xmath77    let @xmath78 ( cf .",

    "it follows that @xmath78 is a doubly stochastic poisson process with instantaneous rate @xmath84 .",
    "the process @xmath64 is then obtained from @xmath78 by thinning with erasure probability @xmath85 ( note that because of ( [ intensity ] ) this quantity is @xmath86 ) .    in the rest of this paper",
    "we will assume that at least one of the inequalities ( [ intensity ] ) or ( [ dark ] ) is strict .",
    "note that this assumption can be made without losing generality for if there was an equality in ( [ intensity ] ) and ( [ dark ] ) then the legitimate receiver s channel and the eavesdropper s channel will be identical and the secrecy capacity will be zero .",
    "we move now to the description of the information transmission aspect of the problem .",
    "the transmitter wishes to communicate a message @xmath87 uniformly distributed on @xmath88 .",
    "an @xmath89 code @xmath90 for the poisson wiretap channel is a stochastic encoder @xmath91 that maps a message @xmath87 to a waveform @xmath57 which satisfies the peak power constraint and a decoder @xmath92 .",

    "our goal is to make this quantity as small as possible .    a secrecy rate @xmath96 is said to be _ achievable _ for the poisson wiretap channel",

    "@xmath101 where @xmath102 is the unique solution in @xmath103 $ ] to the following equation @xmath104    this result assumes that @xmath105 is known to the transmitter .",
    "yet it follows that @xmath106 is an achievable rate with perfect secrecy even if the eavesdropper observes @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are unknown but satisfy @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus , only one - sided estimates of @xmath112 and @xmath113 are needed . in practice , an upper bound on @xmath112",
    "could be provided by guaranteeing that any potential eavesdropper is more than a certain distance away from the transmitter . a lower bound on the dark current @xmath113",
    "could be provided using ambient noise measurements and the known physical limitations of existing receivers .",
    "* worst case scenario : * a particularly insightful case is when @xmath114 .",
    "this situation happens when the eavesdropper observes a thinned version of the signal of the legitimate receiver , i.e. , @xmath115 in ( [ ytilda ] ) . in this case , after some algebraic manipulations , we obtain that @xmath116 and the secrecy capacity reduces to @xmath117 this is saying that the secrecy capacity is the difference between the capacity of the main channel ( the channel between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver ) and the capacity of the eavesdropper s channel .",
    "for instance , in the special case when there is no dark current @xmath118 , we find that @xmath119 and the secrecy capacity reduces to @xmath120 for a degraded dmc , wyner @xcite showed that the secrecy capacity is equal to @xmath21 .",
