    "suppose a continuous random variable @xmath0 has cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath1 and a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath2 .",
    "the differential entropy @xmath3 of the random variable @xmath0 is defined to be @xmath4 the entropy is one of the most applicable uncertainty measures in many statistical and engineering problems . in statistical literature ,",
    "the entropy is used in calculation of the kullback - leibler ( kl ) information which is a powerful mean for performing goodness of fit tests .",
    "the kullback - leibler ( k - l ) information of @xmath2 against @xmath5 is defined in [ 7 ] to be @xmath6 since @xmath7 has the property that @xmath8 , and the equality holds if only if @xmath9 , the estimate of the k - l information has also been considered as a goodness of fit test statistic by some authors including [ 2 ] and [ 5 ] . it has been shown in the aforementioned papers that the test statistics based on the k - l information perform very well for testing exponentiality [ 5 ] as compared , in terms of power , with some leading test statistics .    ranked set sampling ( rss ) has been developed by mcintyre ( 1952 ) .",
    "this method is applied for situations in which measuring a variable is costly or difficult , but where ranking in small subsets is easy . in this method ,",
    "we first subdivide a sample of size @xmath10 randomly into @xmath11 subsamples of size @xmath11 , rank each subsample visually or using any simple or cheap method and then in the @xmath12 subsample , measure and record only the unit of rank @xmath13 which is denoted by @xmath14 @xmath15 . since the subsamples are independent , @xmath14 s are independent random variables .",
    "also the marginal distribution of @xmath14 is the same as that of @xmath16 order statistic from a sample of size @xmath11 of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath17 . as it was proved by mcintyre , mean of this sample is an unbiased estimator of the mean of @xmath18 with an efficiency slightly less than @xmath19 , relative to the mean of a simple random sample ( srs ) of size @xmath11 .",
    "thus  ranked set sampling should be useful when the quantification of an element is difficult but the elements of a set are easily drawn and ranked by judgment . \"",
    "( dell and clutter 1972 ) .",
    "this method was also extended to estimating variance ( stokes 1980a ) , correlation coefficient ( stokes 1980b ) and the situations in which the sample is subdivided into subsamples of different sizes .    in this paper",
    ", we introduced two estimators for the entropy and compare them with each other and the estimator of the entropy in simple random sampling ( srs ) in the sense of bias and root of mean square errors ( rmse ) .",
    "it is observed that the rss scheme would improve this estimator .",
    "the best estimator of the entropy is used along with the estimator of the mean and two biased and unbiased estimators of variance based on rss scheme , to estimate the kl information and perform goodness of fit tests for exponentiality and normality .",
    "the desired critical values and powers are calculated .",
    "it is also observed that rss estimators would increase powers .",
    "the nonparametric estimation of the entropy @xmath20 an estimate of ( [ h ] ) can be constructed by replacing the distribution function @xmath21 by the empirical distribution @xmath22 the derivative of @xmath23 is estimated by @xmath24 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath25 is then @xmath26    .simulated minimum rmse ( mrmse ) and minimum absolute bias ( mab ) of @xmath27 and @xmath28 and optimal @xmath29 for @xmath30 and three distributions with different values of @xmath13 . [",
