    "jets span distances of hundreds of kpc to mpc and constitute the largest physical manifestation of the agn phenomenon .",
    "however , fundamental questions about the nature of jets remain unanswered , while emission processes associated with the production of x - rays and @xmath3-rays are critical to understanding quasars .",
    "the discovery of many x - ray jets over the last 6 years with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory @xcite ( _ chandra _ hereafter ) indicate that jets , and in particular large scale jets ( @xmath4  kpc ) are common ( e.g. schwartz et al 2000 , marshall et al 2001 , worrall et al 2001 , sambruna et al 2002 , siemiginowska et al 2003 , sambruna et al 2004 , marshall et al 2005 )    the synchrotron origin of the radio to optical jet emission has now been well established .",
    "however the origin of the jet x - ray emission is puzzling ( see harris & krawczynski 2006 for review ) since a straight extrapolation of the synchrotron ( radio - to - optical ) continuum into the x - rays severely underpredicts the luminosity of powerful _",
    "chandra _ large scale jets .",
    "thus , the same single power - law population of electrons can not produce the radio , optical , and x - ray emission in the framework of a homogeneous one - emission zone approximation ( see for example sambruna et al 2004 ) .",
    "the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process can not easily explain the data because it does not produce enough x - rays at the equipartition fields and therefore requires large departures from the minimum - power condition ( chartas et al 2000 , harris & krawczynski 2002 , kataoka & stawarz 2005 ) .",
    "it was proposed that the x - rays from large - scale quasar jets might be associated with inverse - compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb ) photons implying large jet bulk lorentz factors ( @xmath5 ) at hundreds of kpc from the active nuclei ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 , celotti et al .",
    "2001 , schwartz 2002 ) .",
    "however , recent _ chandra _ observations indicate several problems with this simple model : ( 1 ) the observed offsets between x - ray and radio peak brightnesses in some jet knots , with the x - ray peak being closer to the core ; ( 2 ) the large variety of x - ray spectral indices observed in several jets ; ( 3 ) the spectral dependence of the knot shapes and profiles , as well as possible knot substructure ( see harris & krawczynski 2006 for a wide discussion ) .",
    "the most widely discussed types of models fall into two main classes : ( i ) synchrotron scenarios invoking separate populations of radiating electrons and/or non - standard broad - band electron spectra ( dermer & atoyan 2004 , stawarz et al 2004 ) and ( ii ) more complex versions of the inverse - compton / cmb models involving knot inhomogeneity or jet deceleration ( tavecchio et al 2003 , georganopoulous & kazanas 2004 ) . the most recent _ spitzer _ and _ chandra _ observations of the famous 3c  273 jet reported by uchiyama et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and jester et al .",
    "( 2006 ) seem to favor the former ( i.e. synchrotron ) scenario , revealing peculiar spectral shapes of the _ synchrotron _ ( polarized ) knot continua in the ir - to - uv photon frequency range , and characteristic broad - band spectral changes along the outflow .",
    "both of these are consistent with the ` two - electron population'/`non - standard particle spectra ' synchrotron model , but could not be explained in the framework of the inverse - compton scenario . yet the question remains if the 3c  273 jet is representative of other large - scale quasar jets detected by _",
    "chandra _ , or is a unique source .",
    "a possible discriminant between synchrotron and ic / cmb emission models in all the sources is related to significant differences in lifetimes of the radiating particles , which will manifest itself in the observed jet morphologies at different wavelengths .",
    "in particular , x - rays emitting synchrotron electrons ( with lorentz factors @xmath6 ) have much shorter lifetimes than the lower energy radio emitting electrons and hence one may expect the x - ray emission from knots to be more compact than the corresponding radio emission .",
    "instead the electron cooling times related to the ic / cmb emission are long since the x - rays are produced by a low energy population of electrons ( @xmath7 ) thus implying continuous , intra - knot x - ray emission outside the bright knots .",
    "such an idealized picture may be however significantly complicated by intermittent / modulated jet activity and efficient particle acceleration acting within the entire jet volume ( stawarz et al .",
    "in such a case , the multiwavelength morphology of the outflow is controlled by the jet activity and acceleration timescales rather than by the radiative cooling timescales of the particles .",
    "the differences in the lifetimes of the radiating electrons could also shape the spectral profiles along the jets , i.e. runs of both broad - band ( e.g. , radio - to - optical ) power - law slopes , and also of the narrow - band ( e.g. , radio , or x - ray ) spectral indices .",
    "however , in order to extract such informations from the data , deep multiwavelength observations are needed .",
    "we note that sambruna et al ( 2004 ) found very flat ( @xmath8 ) to almost inverted ( @xmath9 ) spectra in a few x - ray jets ( though with large uncertainties - the majority have errors from 0.3 - 0.9 ) , which they associated with the ic / cmb from the electron population near the low energy cut - off of the electron distribution . alternatively ,",
    "in the framework of the synchrotron scenario , flat x - ray continua may indicate spectral pile - up occurring at the high - energy part of the electron energy distribution , which is in fact expected if the continuous particle acceleration acts efficiently enough ( see stawarz & ostrowski 2002 ) .",
    "one of the longest x - ray jets known was discovered by _",
    "chandra _ in the second year of the mission ( siemiginowska et al .",
    "2002 , paper i ) . with a length of almost 300  kpc projected onto the sky ,",
    "this jet , associated with the redshift z=1.18 radio - loud quasar pks  1127 - 145 , poses several questions for x - ray emission models .",
    "the one - sided jet shows an x - ray surface brightness which declines with the distance from the core , while the radio brightness increases .",
    "the jet slightly curves , with position angle ( with respect to the core ) changing from @xmath10 at the core to @xmath11 at the jet s end .",
    "the discovery observation identified three main knots along the jet with the furthest knot c being the weakest .",
    "the prominent knots a and b are connected by continuous x - ray emission that stops beyond knot b at @xmath12  arcsec from the core .",
    "the vla radio maps show very low brightness emission along the jet ( fig.5 in siemiginowska et al 2002 ) and the x - ray to radio intensity ratio decreases along the jet .",
    "the hst wfpc2 observation gives upper limits to the knots optical brightness , but they are too high for constraining the emission models . thus only radio and x - ray observations can be used to study emission processes in this jet .",
    "the new _ chandra _ data significantly improve on the discovery observation . with the deep exposure and high s",
    "/ n it is obvious that the jet morphology is complex and some substructure is clearly visible in the large knots .",
    "we now do not detect offsets of 0.8 - 2  arcsec between the x - ray and radio peak brightnesses reported in paper i , but conclude that they are now mostly attributable to the jet substructure .",
    "we also obtain well constrained spectral information for the main jet features .",
    "we discuss the results in the context of currently considered emission models and pose questions .",
    "this is clearly a remarkable jet providing us with many constraints on the current emission models .",
    "below we discuss in detail `` one - component '' emission models and show that they fail to explain the pks  1127 - 145  jet data .",
    "we suggest that a two - component model ( the proper jet and a sheath ) can describe the data .",
    "we also consider the possibility of modulated jet activity , which might be responsible for the observed jet morphology .",
    "the x - ray data are presented in section  [ section - chandra ] , radio data in section  [ section - radio ] , jet morphology and spectral properties are presented in sections  [ section - morphology ] and  [ section - spectra ] , optical data in section 6 , and a discussion of the results and implications for jet models is in section  [ section - models ] . throughout this paper",
    "we use the cosmological parameters based on the wmap measurements ( spergel et al .",

    "the new observation of pks  1127 - 145 with _",
    "chandra _ was obtained on april 25 - 27 , 2005 ( obsid 5708 ) with @xmath18106  ksec exposure .",
    "this was the second _ chandra _ observation of this quasar following the discovery of the x - ray jet in ao1 pointing ( 30  ksec , obsid=866 ) .",
    "the source was placed 30  arcsec from the default aim - point position on the acis - s backside illuminated ccd , chip s3 ( proposers observatory guide , pog ) . to reduce the effects of pileup we collected the data in 1/8 subarray readout mode of one ccd only , which resulted in a 0.441 sec frame readout time .",
    "the quasar s count rate of 0.62  cts  s@xmath14 gives 8 - 10@xmath20 pileup in the core for this choice of the readout mode ( see pog ) .",
    "after standard filtering , the effective exposure time for this observation was 103,203 sec .",
    "the standard off - set pointing was used in this observation to avoid the node boundary . however , due to the drift of the optical axis since the _ chandra _ launch in 1999 the aim point location has moved closer to the node boundary ( pog ) and the quasar core was crossing the node during the observation .",
    "this affected the core data and about 30% of the core photons were marked as bad due to their location on the node boundary .",
    "because of a choice of the roll angle the jet was placed away from the node and the jet data more than 3  arcsec away from the quasar centroid are not affected by the node boundary .",
    "the x - ray data analysis was performed with the ciao  3.3 software using calibration files from the caldb  3 database .",
    "we ran acis_process_events to remove pixel randomization and to obtain the highest resolution image data .",
    "the x - ray position of the quasar ( ra@xmath21 , dec@xmath22 j2000 ) agrees with the radio position  @xcite to better than 0.25@xmath23 , ( which is smaller than _ chandra _ s 90@xmath20 pointing accuracy of 0.6 , weisskopf et al .",
    "all spectral modeling was done in _ sherpa _ @xcite .",
    "the vla observations of feb 2001 from program ah730 ( 1.4 and 8.5 ghz ) are described in paper i , but are also included in table  [ tab - radio ] for completeness .",
    "the 1.4 ghz data were rummaged here with a smaller ( uniform weighted ) beam revealing the presence of the x - ray detected feature o. this is the only radio detection of this knot at the sensitivity of the higher frequency vla maps ( below ) .",
    "we also reduced 5 ghz observations obtained as part of this program ( june 2001 ) which were not available at the time of submission of paper i. these data were taken in a less extended ( b ) configuration to synthesize matched resolution images at different frequencies ( figure  6 ) .",
    "all data were calibrated in aips@xcite and imaging was done in difmap @xcite .",
    "four antennas were sub - arrayed to another project as our observations commenced , so effectively , only 23 antennas participated in this experiment .",
    "new longer integration 8.5 ghz data were obtained in may 2005 mainly to improve the sensitivity in order to better define the radio jet morphology than in the previous 2001 image published in paper i. three antennas were being retrofitted for the evla at the time leaving 24 in the new experiment .",
    "the first hours of observations were flagged as this was when the target was rising ( 15 - 25 deg elevation ) and high cloud cover was reported .",
    "this left 6.25 hours of on - source time in the 8 hr observing run .",
    "after standard calibration and imaging , we removed the core ( 3.23 jy ) with the uvsub task in aips to isolate the inner jet emission .",
    "we merged the new 8.5 ghz dataset with the previous one from 2001 but found no significant improvement in the images produced ; only data from the latter epoch are used here . in the final core - subtracted image",
    "clean components were convolved with a circular gaussian of fwhm=0.7  , so radio structures appearing non - circular in figures  7 &  8 are intrinsically elongated .    off - source",
    "rms levels for the radio images are listed in table  1 along with the resultant dynamic range relative to the image peaks . in all cases ,",
    "the rms is higher than the expected theoretical limit ( factors from @xmath18310 times larger ) .",
    "this is presumably due to a combination of the bright radio core and the low - declination of the target making the field difficult to map . in the vicinity of the core , imaging artifacts ( in the north - south direction )",
    "are somewhat obvious and the rms levels are even higher than the off - source values .",
    "this is reflected in the upper limits for several of the undetected inner radio knots reported in table  2 .",
    "we consider the x - ray morphology of the large scale jet starting @xmath18  3  arcsec away from the quasar centroid .",
    "the analysis of the quasar core and the small scale structure in the vicinity of the quasar will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the smoothed acis - s image in fig .  [ smooth ] shows a complex structure of a continuous x - ray emission along the jet up to @xmath24  arcsec distance from the core .",
    "there are several brightenings present within a diffuse x - ray emission between the brightest knots .",
    "the jet width is resolved and a structure at @xmath25  arcsec distance from the core showing a kink is `` real '' .",
    "we discuss this kink in the section below .",
    "we constructed an x - ray jet profile along the jet and a control profile with the regions shown in fig .",
    "[ jet - reg ] .",
    "the background for each jet s cell was taken from an annulus with radial widths of the jet cell , excluding the readout streaks , the control region and a bright point source .",
    "the resulting profile is presented in fig .",
    "[ profile - hr ] .",
    "the jet x - ray emission declines gradually along the jet with the knots a , b and c present .",
    "figure  [ profile - zoom ] is a zoomed version of fig .",
    "[ profile - hr ] to present the emission beyond knot b. the x - ray jet emission seems to stop at the `` edge '' of knot b before it slightly increases to form knot c. comparison between the jet and control profiles in fig .",
    "[ profile - zoom ] indicates that the emission of knot c ends at @xmath26  arcsec , although the emission within the final 4  arcsec ( between 26 - 30  ) is only marginally detected .",
    "the morphology of each knot is quite different .",
    "the profile of knot a shows a relatively sharp rise and a plateau before a gradual decline , while knot b profile is more peaked with a strong rise and decline ( see fig .",
    "[ profile - zoom ] ) .",
    "knot c is the faintest knot with the x - ray emission spread over a larger area .",
    "as we show below , x - ray emission covers the area of the strongest radio emission , which is also diffuse here .",
    "one gets an impression that knot c looks more like a lobe than a knot .",
    "although , even with _",
    "resolution we still can only resolve structures on @xmath27  arcsec scales and even `` compact '' knots a and b are of the size of the entire m87 jet for example ( see fig.6 in harris & krawczynski 2006 for comparison of the jet projected lengths ) . thus what we see reflects the overall integrated intensity within each region , while there might be many smaller scale regions which can not be resolved .",
    "looking at both the jet profile and the smoothed x - ray image it is clear that the morphology of the jet is complex .",
    "in addition to the three knots we identify brightenings ( knots o and i ) between the core and knot a , as well as a drop in the surface brightness at @xmath28  arcsec from the core .",
    "we also detect the emission in between the knots .",
    "the vla radio maps 1.4  ghz and 5  ghz are presented in fig .",
    "[ radiocl ] .",
    "the vla 8.5  ghz map is in fig .",
    "[ radio - x1 ] and fig .",
    "[ radio - x2 ] and in this map the core has been subtracted to highlight the very faint jet structure .",
    "it is obvious that the radio emission of the innermost jet is very faint , with knot a at the detection threshold .",
    "the emission becomes strong at the outermost regions with knots b and c being quite strong .",
    "there is continuous emission between the last two knots , so their peak brightnesses are connected .    the 8.5  ghz radio profile of the jet shown in fig .",
    "[ radio - x - profile ] shows the jet brightness increasing towards the final knot .",
    "the brightness of the last two knots is almost identical .",
    "the innermost regions of the jet , identified as region i are also detected at this frequency while there is only an upper limit to the radio emission at the location of the o feature .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] presents the radio flux density measurements for each map .",
    "given the three radio frequencies we can determine the radio spectral index for the brightest knots and get @xmath29 equal to 0.8 and 0.9 for knots b and c respectively .",
    "figure  [ radio - x - profile ] compares x - ray and radio intensities along the jet .",
    "the profile intensities were extracted assuming the same box region for the radio 8.5  ghz and x - ray ( 0.3 - 7  kev ) data ( using ds9 projection ) and taking 2.5  arcsec width for the region box .",
    "the two profiles look quite different .",
    "the x - ray intensity decreases with the knots on top of a continuous emission , while the radio intensity stays at a very low level to about 16  arcsec when it sharply rises to form knot b , than decays to a diffuse level and rises again to form knot c. the three knots i , a and b are the strongest x - ray features , while knots b and c dominate the radio emission .",
    "the x - ray emission of knot a is very prominent in comparison to the radio emission",
    ". it does not have an obvious peak , but rather a broad flat profile .",
    "knot a is very faint in radio and its radio spectrum is very steep ( @xmath30 ) in comparison to knots b and c whose spectra are more typical , @xmath31 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the emission from knot b is very prominent in both radio and x - rays and the knot profiles can be studied in more details . in paper",
    "i we reported the offsets between the radio and x - ray peak brightnesses of 1.4  arcsec for this knot ( using the radio data with the uncertainties of 1  arcsec at 1.4  ghz and x - rays with uncertainties of 0.3  arcsec ) .",
    "with the improved s / n _ chandra _ image and 8.5  ghz radio data we can model directly the profiles of the knot and obtain more accurate locations of the peaks ( see fig .  [ radio - x - profile ] ) .",
    "we measure that the radio ( 8.5  ghz ) and x - ray peak brightnesses are coincident to within 0.2  arcsec .",
    "the x - ray emission precedes the radio emission for this knot in the sense that the x - rays start rising before the radio and decay earlier than the radio .",
    "thus the x - ray profile of this knot seems to be shifted in comparison to the radio profile .",
    "the radio emission of knot c is strong and its profile shows a step before the final rise to the maximum at 28  arcsec .",
    "then the emission drops and the knot ends at 31  arcsec .",
    "the x - ray emission is very faint with constant intensity .",
    "[ profile - hr ] show the hardness ratio along the jet .",
    "we define the hardness ratio as ( h - s / h+s ) , where h is the hard source counts with 2 - 7  kev energies , and s is the soft source counts with 0.5 - 2  kev energies .",
    "the hardness ratio errors are calculated using the bayesian algorithm of park et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "the jet s x - ray spectrum has a constant hardness ratio up to about 8  arcsec , in the vicinity of the `` kink '' with a sudden drop in the jet intensity .",
    "the hardness ratio suggests a spectral change at this point which continues further along within knot a. it seems that the jet spectrum hardens along knot a , and then becomes softer again before hardening within knot b. the signal - to - noise ratio is too low to study the hardness ratio variations beyond knot b.    to characterize the jet spectral properties we extracted the x - ray spectra of small parts of the jet , assuming the box regions shown in fig.[jet - reg ] .",
    "the total number of counts and the best fit power law model parameters are presented in the table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the power law slope indicates a hard ( flat ) spectrum @xmath32 for the inner regions i , o and knot a and a soft ( steep ) spectrum , @xmath33 , for the outer knots b and c.    to check whether the difference in the x - ray emission from the inner and outer jet is significant we extracted the spectra from the two large regions : the inner jet region contains knots i , o and a , and the outer jet knots b and c. we then fit these two spectra ( using the calibration files appropriate for the new extraction regions ) with an absorbed power law model .",
    "we obtain the power law slopes for each region , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "thus the spectral difference between the two regions is at @xmath36 level .",
    "the hardness ratios based on the source counts for the inner and outer jets are -0.48@xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "we analyzed the x - ray emission between the knot a and b regions , e.g. in the annulus with inner and outer radii of 14 and 16.5 arcsec .",
    "there are total of 24 counts with energy between 0.3 - 8 kev and 18.3@xmath39 net counts ( assuming a background annulus with the same radii , but excluding the jet region ) .",
    "the detected number of counts is too small for detailed spectral analysis .",
    "however , the spectrum is soft based on the hardness ratio of -0.73@xmath40 .",
    "an optical image of pks  1127 - 145  that was taken with hst @xcite shows a number of galaxies with a large galaxy across the x - ray jet .",
    "a damped lyman-@xmath41 system ( dla ) at redshift 0.312 has been described by @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite for detailed optical spectra ) .",
    "because the dla galaxy has to be located close to the line of sight to the quasar , it may affect the emission from the quasar jet .",
    "our comparison between the x - ray and radio jet morphology indicates that the change in the jet shape is present in both bands ( see fig .",
    "[ smooth ] and fig .",
    "[ radiocl ] ) , thus we can exclude the absorption of jet emission by the foreground galaxy as a cause for the observed jet morphology . a slight change in the direction of the jet might therefore be intrinsic to the jet or a result of gravitational lensing of the jet by the foreground galaxy .",
    "there is no detection of the optical jet and the limits for the optical jet emission were given in @xcite for knots b and c. the limits for knot a and remaining inner knots can not be obtained due to the galaxies in the field .",
    "these limits are too high to provide additional constraints on the jet properties .",
    "deeper optical / ir imaging is necessary to improve the limits .",
    "the radio and x - ray images of the pks 1127 - 145 jet and the analysis of the jet s broad - band spectral properties reveal significant differences between the inner ( @xmath42 ) ( knots i , o , and a ; hereafter ` the inner jet ' ) , and the outer portions of the jet ( @xmath43 , knots b and c ; hereafter ` the outer jet ' ) .",
    "this is not unusual among the large - scale quasar jets and it is seen in the 3c  273 jet for example ( uchiyama et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "however , one should note the large extension of the pks 1127 - 145 jet : both its inner and outer parts have projected sizes of @xmath44 kpc each , while the entire 3c 273 jet structure is only @xmath45 kpc - long .",
    "the pks  1127 - 145 inner jet is very weak in the radio band , especially at high frequencies ( @xmath46  ghz ) , while it is bright in x - rays .",
    "however , the x - ray and radio luminosities of the outer jet are roughly comparable ( see figures 5 , 7 , and 9 ) . a general trend of a smooth decrease in the x - ray flux , and a slow increase in the radio flux can be noted along the jet , with the exception of the innermost knot i ( for which the measured radio fluxes may suffer from contamination of the extremely bright core ) .",
    "this , discussed previously by hardcastle ( 2006 ) , is again reminiscent of the 3c 273 jet .",
    "in particular , the ratio of @xmath47 kev to @xmath48 ghz luminosities decreases by about two orders of magnitude starting from @xmath49_{\\rm 1 \\ , kev } / [ \\nu l_{\\nu}]_{\\rm 1.4 \\ , ghz }   \\approx 50 $ ] at the position of knot o , to @xmath50 at the position of knot c. at high radio frequencies this decrease seems to be even stronger , since the upper limits for the @xmath46  ghz flux for knots o and a translates to the luminosity ratio @xmath49_{\\rm 1 \\ , kev } / [ \\nu l_{\\nu}]_{\\rm 8.5 \\ , ghz } > 100 $ ] .",
    "the x - ray spectral index is constant within the inner jet , @xmath51 , and it is slightly smaller than the radio spectral indices between @xmath48 , @xmath52 and @xmath46 ghz , namely @xmath53 . also it is smaller than the radio - to - x - ray power - law slopes ( see figure 10 ) , although the errors in estimating the appropriate radio fluxes are large .",
    "we note that at the position of knot a the @xmath46 ghz flux is especially low and the high frequency part of the radio continuum is very steep .",
    "thus , the electrons emitting x - ray photons in the inner jet , regardless of the particular emission process ( synchrotron or inverse - compton ) , are characterized by a much flatter energy spectrum than the radio - emitting ones .",
    "the situation is however much different for the outer jet . here",
    "the relatively large x - ray spectral indices , @xmath54 , seem to be larger than the radio - to - x - ray power - law slopes or radio spectral indices , which are all @xmath55 ( see figure 10 ) .",
    "lack of reliable optical data makes it difficult to investigate the broad - band energy distribution of the inner jet emission . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown recently by uchiyama et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and jester et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the case of the 3c 273 jet , a comparison between the broad - band radio - to - optical and the optical - to - x - ray power - law slopes _ can be misleading _ in deducing the origin of the jet x - ray emission _ unless detailed optical photometry _ , and not solely upper limits , is available .",
    "such detailed optical information is unfortunately not available for the pks 1127 - 145 jet , and so below we focus strictly on the confrontation of the radio and x - ray data , in particular their _ global _ characteristics , instead of modeling isolated knot regions .",
    "first we discuss whether the observed morphological and spectral properties of the radio / x - ray pks 1127 - 145 jet can be explained in the framework of the ` one emitting - zone ' ic / cmb and synchrotron models .",
    "the particular issues to be explained are : ( i ) a decrease of the x - ray flux , ( ii ) an increase of the radio flux , ( iii ) a steepening of the x - ray continuum , and ( iv ) a flattening of the radio continuum along the jet .",
    "later , in the last two sub - sections , we present a two - component jet emission model and finally discuss the application of intermittent / modulated jet activity to this source .      the simplest version of the one - zone ic / cmb model to consider would involve relativistic outflow with negligible bulk deceleration and energy dissipation , expanding adiabatically when propagating through the intergalactic medium .",
    "this , in fact , was argued by tavecchio et al .",

    "thus , the observed monochromatic synchrotron  e.g. , radio  luminosity scales as @xmath73 , since magnetic field intensity does change within adiabatically expanding outflow , @xmath74 . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of the observed inverse - compton to synchrotron luminosities at chosen observed frequencies ( e.g. , @xmath47 kev and @xmath48 ghz ) reads as @xmath75(r ) \\propto b^{-(p+1)/2}$ ] , assuming that the shape of the electron energy distribution is roughly the same all along the jet ( which is a good approximation for the value @xmath76 suggested by the observed range of the x - ray and low - frequency radio indices in the pks 1127 - 145 jet ) .",
    "note that the @xmath77 ratio is then completely described by the magnetic field evolution and the electron spectral index so long as @xmath59 does not change down the jet .",
    "it follows immediately from the above that in the case of adiabatic expansion of a jet with conserved magnetic energy flux , both inverse - compton _ and _ synchrotron luminosities decrease along the outflow . for example , if the jet magnetic field consists predominantly of a poloidal or toroidal component , the field is expected to scale with a distance as @xmath78 or @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "the former ( ` poloidal ' ) scaling can not however hold along the entire jet length , i.e. from the jet base ( a few to several schwartzschild radii from the nucleus ) up to the jet termination point ( about @xmath80 kpc from the active center ) . indeed , taking the maximum magnetic field intensity @xmath81 g at the jet base ( as appropriate for ten schwartzschild radii from the central black hole with mass @xmath82 ) it would imply unrealistically low intensities on hundred kpc scales , @xmath83  g ( see recent discussion in sikora et al .",
    "2005 regarding the magnetic field in quasar jets ) .",
    "therefore we consider only the @xmath84 case ( see in this context tavecchio et al .",
    "2004 ) , in which the x - ray ( inverse - compton ) luminosity scales with distance as @xmath85 while the radio ( synchrotron ) one as @xmath86 for the assumed @xmath87 .",
    "this scaling of luminosities indicates that in the framework of the one - zone ic / cmb model no adiabatic expansion of the pks 1127 - 145 jet is possible , since otherwise the expected attenuation of the x - ray and radio fluxes would be inconsistent with the data .",
    "indeed , taking the positions of knots o and c relative to the core as @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively ( see table 2 ) , one should expect @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "meanwhile , the observations indicate that although the @xmath47 kev luminosity decreases by about an order of magnitude between knots o and c , the @xmath48  ghz luminosity increases by as much as a factor of @xmath92 instead of decreasing be a factor of 100 ..    given the above conclusion we now consider an efficient confinement of the outflow , i.e. no jet expansion , which would give the slowest attenuation of the synchrotron ( radio ) luminosity .",
    "we also allow for the jet deceleration , @xmath93 , and non - adiabatic changes of the jet magnetic field due to the related dissipation of the jet kinetic energy .",
    "the expressions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) give then @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "in this case , an increase of the radio luminosity could be obtained if the jet magnetic field is amplified .",
    "for instance , for a choice of @xmath96 and @xmath97 the x - ray luminosity decreases as @xmath98 , while the radio luminosity increases like @xmath99 , resulting in ( required by the data ) a factor of @xmath100 change in the x - ray - to - radio luminosity ratio .",

    "if , therefore , the energy equipartition between the jet magnetic field and the radiating electrons is valid for knot o , @xmath103 , then for knot c the equipartition would have to be broken , @xmath104 . in order to keep the energy equipartition , one would have to assume that the normalization of the electron energy distribution also increases along the jet just like @xmath105 , giving @xmath106 and @xmath107 , i.e. that the amount of the jet energy dissipated to the radiating particles is always equal to the one transferred to the jet magnetic field .",

    "as shown above , this is in fact a natural consequence of the equipartition requirement in the ic / cmb model if the decreasing ( along the outflow ) x - ray luminosity anticorrelates with the radio one .",
    "tavecchio et al ( 2006 ) proposed that such changes in the jet parameters and the resulting radio and x - ray profiles are due to the entrainment of the intergalactic medium by the large - scale jet , but as shown by hardcastle ( 2006 ) the entrained masses required are implausibly high in some cases .    yet , the observed changes of the x - ray and radio spectral indices along the pks  1127 - 145 jet pose problems to the inverse - compton scenario .",
    "indeed , in the framework of the ic / cmb model electrons emitting the observed @xmath47 kev photons have lorentz factors @xmath110 , while the electrons emitting the observed @xmath48 ghz synchrotron radiation have lorentz factors @xmath111 , where @xmath112 g. thus , for any doppler factor @xmath113 and a magnetic field close to the equipartition value @xmath114 ( see siemiginowska et al .",
    "2002 , kataoka & stawarz 2005 ) one has @xmath115 .",
    "this means that radiative cooling , if being a dominant factor shaping the spectral indices profiles along the pks 1127 - 145 jet , would be more pronounced in radio frequencies than in the x - rays . in other words ,",
    "the radio continuum should have to steepen more significantly with distance than the x - ray continuum .",
    "in fact the observed behaviour is just the opposite : the radio spectral indices decrease along the jet , while the x - ray spectral index eventually increases . which is even more surprising is that in the outer portion of the jet the x - ray spectral index is larger than the radio one , what  in the framework of the ic / cmb model  would imply that the energy distribution of the radiating electrons unexpectedly _ steepens _ towards the lower energies .",
    "thus , we conclude that the simplest one - zone ic / cmb model is not consistent with the observed morphological and spectral properties of the pks 1127 - 145 radio / x - ray jet unless arbitrary additional assumptions are invoked . in any case",
    ", its adiabatic version can be completely rejected .      because of the extremely large jet lengths and extremely short radiative cooling timescales of electrons with energies required for the synchrotron x - ray emission ( lorentz factors @xmath116 ) one obvious requirement of the synchrotron hypothesis is continuous acceleration of the high - energy electrons along the jet .",
    "the simplest version of the ` one - zone ' synchrotron model would be therefore a scenario in which some unspecified acceleration mechanism is acting continuously and similarly within the entire uniform jet volume , producing and _ maintaining _ a uniform electron energy distribution with the steep power law plus flat spectrum component at high energies . such an energy spectrum could be characterized in a zero - order approximation by two power - laws with indices @xmath117 and @xmath118 at low and high electron energies , respectively . as in the case of the inverse compton hypothesis",
    "let us check if such a simple model can account for the observed properties of the pks  1127 - 145 jet .",
    "just like in the previous subsection , one can conclude that no adiabatic expansion of the jet is possible , since the radio luminosity would decrease along the jet much faster than the x - ray .",
    "an efficient confinement of the jet and non - negligible dissipation of the bulk kinetic energy give a scaling of the high- and low - energy synchrotron luminosities @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and thus @xmath121(r ) \\propto \\left(\\delta \\ , b\\right)^{(p_2-p_1)/2}$ ] .",
    "lets take the illustrative spectral indices of the electron energy distribution close to @xmath122 ( representing the low - frequency radio continuum ) and @xmath123 ( representing freshly accelerated , i.e. uncooled x - ray emitting electrons ) .",
    "we note that for example relatively well understood stochastic acceleration of particles due to resonant scattering on turbulent mhd waves characterized by the energy spectrum @xmath124 is expected to result in formation of the steady state particle energy distribution @xmath125 where @xmath126 ( for particle energies below the maximum energy defined by the radiative loss timescale ; see the discussion in kataoka et al .",
    "thus , for the typical turbulence energy index @xmath127 one should indeed expect particle spectra with @xmath128 , i.e. much flatter than the ones claimed by the shock scenarios ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "it follows immediately that the agreement between the predicted and the observed luminosity profiles along the pks  1127 - 145 jet is possible only if the high - energy spectral component of the radiating electrons is very flat , and if in addition the magnetic field is strongly amplified along the jet .",
    "namely , the decrease of the x - ray luminosity by a factor of @xmath130 and the increase of the radio luminosity by a factor of @xmath131 would be possible for @xmath132 only if @xmath133 and @xmath134 , while @xmath135 would require even more drastic magnetic field amplification .",
    "these changes of the jet parameters are worrisome , simply because it is difficult to isolate the appropriate mechanisms causing such a strong jet deceleration and extremely effective conversion of the jet kinetic energy to the magnetic one ( see again comments by hardcastle 2006 on the entrainment process on large scales ) .",
    "although it can be argued that _ some _ magnetic field amplification and _ some _ bulk deceleration are taking place along the extragalactic large - scale jets anyway , as suggested by the observed in many cases the increase in the radio surface brightness and decrease in the jet - couterjet brightness asymmetry away from a core , the particular model parameters obtained above are rather too extreme and should be considered implausible .",
    "on the other hand , the assumption about the uniform electron energy distribution within the entire jet is not a natural nor a realistic one for the synchrotron / continuous acceleration scenario .",
    "in fact , if the high - energy flat - spectrum ( pile - up ) component in the electron distribution is produced , it results most probably from turbulent acceleration processes .",
    "thus , the normalization , the effective spectral index , and the cut - off energy of such a pile - up component should depend on the local plasma conditions at a given distance along the jet ( magnetic field intensity , turbulence parameters , jet velocity structure , etc . ) .",
    "these factors can influence significantly model predictions when compared to the simplest scenario discussed above ( which can hardly explain the observed radio / x - ray flux profiles along the pks  1127 - 145 jet ) . discussing all these effects",
    "would require much deeper insight into the microscopic processes in relativistic magnetized plasma , which are still hardly known .",
    "we can however consider briefly one simple possibility and discuss the consequences of the assumption that the normalization of the high - energy flat spectrum electron component producing synchrotron x - rays depends on the kinematic parameters of the jet .",
    "since the jet shear boundary layer is the site of choice for generation of the high energy electrons ( stawarz & ostrowski 2002 ) , one could speculate that the efficiency of the particle acceleration process ( and thus the normalization of the electron distribution @xmath136 , where @xmath137 at high energies ) is somehow proportional to the velocity shear across the relativistic outflow , @xmath138 ( where @xmath139 is the radial jet dimension and @xmath140 is the jet radius ) , at any distance from the core .",
    "that is to say , for the confined cylindrical jet ( @xmath141 ) and a constant jet viewing angle , we introduce a simple scaling @xmath142 with the power - law coefficient being @xmath143 for generality .",
    "in such a case , with @xmath132 and @xmath122 considered previously , the synchrotron x - ray and radio luminosities should go like @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "taking therefore @xmath146 as an arbitrary illustrative value , one can find that moderate changes @xmath147 and @xmath148 reproduces well the luminosity profiles observed along pks 1127 - 145 jet .",
    "these are then not implausible anymore",
    ".    however , the observed changes of the x - ray and radio spectral indices are again problematic for the simple synchrotron model discussed here .",
    "while it is true that one should expect some ageing of the x - ray continuum , it is not clear why the observed increase of the x - ray spectral index is so gradual , and in addition accompanied with a flattening of the radio spectrum .",
    "if one assumes that the freshly accelerated high - energy part of the electron energy distribution is indeed very flat ( @xmath149 ) then the spectral index of the constantly injected radiatively cooled ( by the standard synchrotron - type energy losses ) high - energy particles should be equal to @xmath150 .",
    "this is quite close to the x - ray spectral index observed within the inner jet .",
    "meanwhile , in the outer jet the x - ray spectral index steepens , suggesting either a significant change in the initial power - law slope of the electron pile - up component ( down to @xmath151 ) , or significant differences in the cooling mechanism in the inner and outer jet .",
    "whatever the case , it is hard to understand why in the inner jet , where the postulated pile - up emission would be relative flat ( and hence the required acceleration process is especially efficient ) , the observed synchrotron continuum at high radio frequencies is very steep .    to summarize , we conclude that also the simplest one - emitting zone version of the synchrotron model with uniform ( though non - standard , i.e. concave ) electron energy spectrum ,",
    "can not easily explain the observed morphological and spectral properties of the pks 1127 - 145 radio / x - ray jet .",
    "a natural solution to the problems encountered by the homogeneous one zone models is to assume that the observed radio and x - ray radiative components are produced in separate regions , possibly by separate and different acceleration processes . here",
    ", we suggest that indeed the detected x - ray photons originate within the _ proper jet _ flow , while the radio photons come from a _ sheath _  a slow moving radial _",
    "extension _ of the jet boundary ( mixing ) layer .",
    "such a possibility is in fact not novel , since it is a variation of the stratified jet scenario ( see de young 1986 , komissarov 1990 , laing 1996 , ostrowski 2000 , discussing different aspects of this issue ) , noted before in the particular case of the _ chandra _ quasar jets by hardcastle ( 2006 ) .",
    "we emphasize , that this _ proper jet - sheath _ model is not exactly the same as the _ spine - shear layer_. the _ sheath _ here is associated with some extension of the jet boundary ( similarly to 3c  273 jet / cocoon system ; see bahcall et al .",
    "1995 ) , while the _ proper jet _ means a fast spine together with the shear layer .    in a framework of the two - component jet model , all the information regarding the broad - band jet emission",
    "is restricted to the x - ray band .",
    "in other words , there are not many additional constraints which could help to distinguish between the synchrotron and inverse - compton origin of the observed x - ray kev photons  both these possibilities have to be kept in mind . however , in an analogy to the x - ray jet in 3c 273 , where almost the same gradual decrease of the x - ray flux and steepening of the x - ray continuum along the jet is observed , one could argue that also in the case of pks  1127 - 145 the x - ray radiation is most probably due to the synchrotron emission of the high energy electrons accelerated continuously within the jet volume ( see a discussion in uchiyama et al .",
    "2006 , jester et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "note also , that assuming a radio - to - x - ray continuum characterized by a single power - law with a slope @xmath152 ( corresponding to the particle spectral index @xmath153 ) , the expected radio emission of the proper jet would be always below the observed radio emission from the pks  1127 - 145 jet regions , since all the radio - to - x - ray spectral indices shown in figure 10 are @xmath154 .",
    "the same is true for the optical emission , as the optical upper limits available for the knots b and c ( siemiginowska et al .",
    "2002 ) imply optical - to - x - ray power - law slopes @xmath155 .",
    "that is not to say that the jet broad - band emission is in reality a single power - law form .",
    "indeed , it may be characterized by a more complicated spectral shape for which however we do not have any strong evidence .    by definition ,",
    "a two - component model doubles the number of free parameters , making model predictions more flexible when confronted with the data . lets therefore briefly discuss whether the observational x - ray / radio constraints ( i)-(iv ) listed at the beginning of this section could be explained in a natural way in a framework of such a scenario .",
    "the observed smooth decrease of the x - ray flux , when unconnected with the increase of the radio one , is in fact expected as a result of the decrease in the inverse - compton or synchrotron luminosities along ( even extremely slowly ) decelerating and/or expanding jet .",
    "these luminosities ( see equations 1 and 2 above ) can be expressed as @xmath156_{ic } \\ , d\\nu \\sim \\delta^6 \\",
    ", \\gamma^{-2 } \\ , { c \\ , \\sigma_t \\over m_e c^2 } \\ ,   v ' \\ , u'_{cmb } \\ , { \\langle\\gamma^2\\rangle \\over \\langle\\gamma\\rangle } \\ , u'_e \\quad , \\ ] ] and @xmath157_{syn } \\ , d\\nu \\sim \\delta^4 \\ , { c \\ , \\sigma_t \\over m_e c^2 } \\ , v ' \\ , u'_b \\ ,   { \\langle\\gamma^2\\rangle \\over \\langle\\gamma\\rangle } \\ , u'_e \\quad , \\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath158 erg @xmath159 at the redshift of pks 1127 - 145 , where the factor @xmath160 characterizes the electron energy spectrum @xmath161 with @xmath162 considered hereafter , and @xmath163 is the comoving emitting volume of some cylindrical portion of the jet with the longitudinal and radial ( with respect to the jet axis ) dimensions @xmath164 and @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "for example , assuming the energy equipartition @xmath165 along the jet , an attenuation of the jet magnetic field @xmath166 ( where @xmath167 ) , and a constant jet s ( small ) opening angle @xmath168 , one obtains the synchrotron luminosity profile @xmath169 , if only the broad - band spectral shape of the emitting electrons ( i.e. , factor @xmath170 ) is roughly constant along the jet .",
    "thus , the observed decrease of the x - ray luminosity , by a factor of @xmath171 between knots i and c ( see figure 9 ) , requires @xmath172 for the negligible changes in the jet doppler factors .",
    "this , in turn , implies a decrease of the jet magnetic field by a factor of @xmath173 along the jet , which is the most extreme change needed , i.e. a lower limit , since some non - negligible ( though rather small ) decrease of the jet doppler factor should be expected .",
    "indeed , if the jet doppler factor decreases by only a factor of @xmath174 between knots i and c , then no decrease of the jet magnetic field intensity is needed to explain the observed decrease of the x - ray ( i.e. , synchrotron ) luminosity along the pks 1127 - 145 jet .",
    "this is much more comfortable situation than a significant amplification required by one - zone models discussed above .",
    "similarly , in the case of the inverse - compton x - ray luminosity assuming the radiating electrons - magnetic field energy equipartition @xmath175 , one gets @xmath176 , leading to the required @xmath177 for the negligible changes in the jet doppler factor between knots i and c. this would imply a significantly larger decrease of the jet magnetic field intensity than before ( by a factor of @xmath178 ) but , again , any small decrease of @xmath179 along the jet can adjust required parameters .",
    "we now check if the observed gradual increase in the jet x - ray spectral index ( i.e. when decoupled from flattening of the radio continuum ) can be incorporated into the synchrotron and the inverse - compton scenarios , by means of adjusting the appropriate radiative losses and dynamical time - scales .",
    "we note , that at the redshift of pks  1127 - 145 , the comoving energy density of the jet magnetic field dominates over the energy density of the cmb radiation as measured in the jet rest frame , @xmath180 , if only @xmath181 @xmath182 g .",
    "this condition is difficult to fulfill , since in the case of quasar large - scale jets we expect @xmath183 and @xmath184 @xmath182 g .",
    "thus , radiative cooling of the jet electrons in pks  1127 - 145 is expected to be mainly due to inverse - comptonization of the cmb photons .",
    "the transition between slow- and fast - cooling regimes for the x - ray emitting electrons occurs at the distance along the jet , @xmath185 , where the dynamical time - scale @xmath186 equals the radiative losses time - scale @xmath187 . here",
    "@xmath188 , and the @xmath189 value of the cmb energy density is @xmath190 erg @xmath159 . with @xmath191 , the observed x - ray photon energy @xmath192 kev , and the energy of the cmb photons @xmath193 mev at the redshift @xmath189 , one can find @xmath194 this , when compared to the projected distance of knot b at which the break in the x - ray spectrum is observed , @xmath195 kpc , is extremely large .",
    "in fact , it can be found that the deprojected distance of knot b equals the expected break radius only for unrealistic jet parameters .",
    "namely , @xmath196 ( where @xmath197 is the jet viewing angle ) requires large bulk lorentz factors of the jet and very large jet inclinations , @xmath198  deg @xmath199 @xmath200  deg for @xmath201 , leading to the energetic problems .",
    "this means that the ic / cmb model can not explain the observed steepening of the x - ray continuum along the pks  1127 - 145 jet in terms of the spectral ageing of the low - energy electrons . instead ,",
    "an _ ` intrinsic ' _ change of the electron spectral shape ( i.e. not due to the radiative cooling but particle acceleration processes ) has to be invoked to explain observations , what is also the case for the synchrotron scenario ( for which analogously evaluated @xmath185 is much smaller than @xmath202 ) .",
    "now we turn our attention to the jet sheath which , by assumption , dominates the observed radio emission of the pks 1127 - 145 jet . here",
    "we investigate if the sheath hypothesis can explain in a simple way the observed increase of the radio flux along the jet accompanied by a flattening of the radio continuum .",
    "note first , that a very similar spectral ( radio ) behaviour is in general observed in all lobes of fr ii radio galaxies .",
    "in particular , a steepening and an attenuation of the radio emission away from the jet termination point in the direction of the nucleus observed in fr ii sources is widely interpreted as a result of the spectral ageing of the radio - emitting plasma ( see kaiser 2000 and references therein ) . in the case of the pks  1127 - 145 ,",
    "however , we propose that the observed radio emission originates from some radial extension of the outflow rather than from the radio lobe ( i.e. plasma backflowing from the jet termination hot spot ) .",
    "thus the question we should answer is why the inner jet ( knots i  a ) produces a very weak and steep - spectrum radio sheath , while the outer jet ( knots b and c ) a relatively bright and flat spectrum one .",
    "( on the other hand , a strict distinction between a jet sheath and a lobe may be quite artificial , especially in the outer portions of the jet . )",
    "we propose that the reason for the observed pks  1127 - 145 jet behaviour is the difference in the dominant cooling process of the radio - emitting sheath s electrons : a radiative cooling within the inner sheath ( surrounding the inner jet ) , and an adiabatic cooling within the outer one ( corresponding to the outer jet ) .",
    "as is well known , the frequency independent adiabatic losses can not significantly affect the spectral shape of the synchrotron emission , while the frequency - dependent radiative losses result in a spectral steepening above a given frequency .",
    "such a steepening may be significant ( resulting even in spectral cut - offs at low radio frequencies ) , depending on the detailed evolution of the radiating particles , which in turn depends on the structure of the magnetic field in the emission region .",
    "this could possibly explain a flat radio spectrum outer sheath and steep spectrum outer sheath . in order to investigate this idea in more detail ,",
    "we assume a non - relativistic bulk velocity of the sheath plasma , and inefficient particle acceleration processes acting thereby .",
    "this is rather for illustrative purposes only and an order - of - magnitude estimate , since in the observer s rest - frame the sheath material may be still moving relativistically , if only the inertia of the proper jet is big enough to ensure a relativistic advance velocity of the jet s head .",
    "in fact , this may be the case of pks  1127 - 145 , which can also help to understand an apparent lack of the counter - sheath on the other side of the nucleus ( just like in 3c  273 as discussed in stawarz 2004 ) .",
    "the radiative ( synchrotron and ic / cmb at @xmath203 ) cooling time scale for the electrons emitting synchrotron photons at frequency @xmath204 can be expressed as @xmath205 where ` min ' indicates a minimum of two values , @xmath206 hz and , as before , @xmath207 g. meanwhile , the time scale for the adiabatic losses can be approximated as @xmath208 where @xmath209 kpc , and we assumed that the sheath expansion velocity is roughly constant at a given distance from the nucleus , @xmath210 .",

    "interestingly , for the expected @xmath227 on @xmath228 kpc distances from the center of the typical galaxy group environment ( see , e.g. , mathews & brighenti 2003 ) , coinciding by assumption with the core of pks 1127 - 145 radio source , our simple model gives very realistic value @xmath229 , and thus the radiative lifetime @xmath230 myrs for the electrons emitting @xmath231 ghz synchrotron photons .",
    "this timescale , as required , is then shorter than the expansion timescale @xmath232 myrs .",
    "moreover , the obtained radiative cooling is roughly comparable to the jet lifetime at the position of knot a , which can be crudely evaluated as @xmath233 myrs for the jet advance velocity @xmath234 and the assumed jet viewing angle @xmath235 .",
    "thus , a very weak ( and steep - spectrum ) radio emission at the position of knot a may be explained by the sheath hypothesis .",
    "meanwhile , further away from the core , at the position of the outer jet , a decreased pressure of the ambient medium is likely to result in a more rapid expansion of the sheath .",
    "namely , anticipating relatively steep profile of the igm density @xmath236 with @xmath237 , one can expect thermal medium surrounding the outer sheath being as rarified as @xmath238 . in this case , taking @xmath239 as before , one obtains the adiabatic cooling timescale @xmath240 myrs , likely shorter than ( or at least comparable with ) the radiative timescale for the electrons emitting @xmath241 ghz synchrotron photons , again as required by the model .",
    "thus , dominant adiabatic cooling can indeed result in the flat - spectrum radio emission at the position of knots b and c. interestingly , the expansion velocity of the outer sheath in a framework of the proposed scenario is expected to be larger than the sound speed in igm , @xmath242 .",
    "this can possibly result in formation of a weak shock in the thermal medium being in the closest vicinity of the radio structure .",
    "further investigation of this issue , involving analysis of the x - ray environment of pks  1127 - 145 radio source , is in preparation .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the pks  1127 - 145 nucleus , based on the observed optical - uv isotropic continuum , is about @xmath243erg  sec@xmath14 ( baejowski et al .",
    "the black hole mass determined by fan & cao ( 2004 ) is about @xmath244  m@xmath245 which gives an eddington luminosity of @xmath246 erg  sec@xmath14 .",
    "thus , pks  1127 - 145 seems to accrete close to the eddington limit , since @xmath247 . during the jet activity epoch the quasar",
    "would then provide a total energy of @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the efficiency factor of converting the accretion power into the kinetic power carried with the jet . because the @xmath250 kpc projected length of the pks  1127 - 145 jet implies @xmath251 myrs ( with the speed of light providing an upper limit for the jet advanced velocity , and with the illustrative jet viewing angle of @xmath252  deg ) , the total energy transported by the jet is @xmath253 ergs , assuming continuous jet activity ( i.e. constant kinetic power of the outflow during the entire activity epoch )    in this context we raise an issue on the nature of the knots in pks  1127 - 145 : can they be considered as the extended shock waves formed within a more or less continuous jet outflow ? in our opinion not , since the projected linear sizes of these knots are uncomfortably large ( @xmath254 kpc ) .",
    "instead , we believe that it is much more natural to consider knots i , o , a , b , and c as representing the separate portions of the jet produced by the active pks  1127 - 145 core in separate epochs of its higher activity ( see a discussion in stawarz et al .",
    "2004 and siemiginowska et al 2002 ) .",
    "since all of the pks 1127 - 145 knots are a few tens of kpc long , the postulated duration of a continuous activity epoch would be roughly @xmath255 yrs .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that this kind of intermittency is the most pronounced in pks  1127 - 145 , possessing the longest x - ray jet known .",
    "interestingly , the radio core of pks  1127 - 145 itself has been classified as a giga - hertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) source ( stanghellini et al .",
    "1998 ) , which are established to be young , i.e. @xmath256 yrs old , versions of powerful radio galaxies ( see odea 1998 ) .",
    "however , as argued by baejowski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) based on the multiwavelength spectrum and the luminosity dominated by @xmath3-rays , the unresolved core ( at least the component producing its high - energy emission ) seems to be related rather to the blazar phenomenon ( see in this context also tornikoski et al .",
    "the presence of @xmath257-kpc - long radio / x - ray jet additionally questions the gps nature of pks 1127 - 145 quasar . on the other hand , in a framework of the ` modulated jet activity ' scenario",
    " evidenced by double - double radio galaxies ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "1999 ) and postulated by reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) to explain statistics of gps sources  there may be no contradiction in the above .",
    "namely , the blazar core of pks  1127 - 145 at the moment of the observation could be considered as being again in the very active state , i.e. , producing another portion of the jet matter with the enhanced kinetic luminosity . at this moment",
    ", the new - born portion of the jet resembles the ` classical ' gps object , but at some later time it will be observed as an extended jet ` knot ' ( similar to the knots i , o , a , b and c discussed in this paper ) .",
    "we note that signatures of intermittent agn jet activity have been suggested also by many recent _ chandra _ observation of x - ray clusters ( fabian et al 2003 , mcnamarra et al 2005 ) .",
    "typical timescales for this activity can be determined from the cluster x - ray and radio morphology , and they are within 10@xmath258  years depending on the source ( see , e.g. , nulsen et al .",
    "2005a , 2005b , forman et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "a total energy of @xmath259  ergs contained within large radio cavities in the most powerful clusters provides an estimate of the total energy carried out by the jet and radio plasma , consistent with our estimates for the quasar pks  1127 - 145 .",
    "the new x - ray and radio data of the pks  1127 - 145 jet do not provide an unambiguous conclusion on the dominant jet x - ray emission process .",
    "it is clear that simple synchrotron or inverse - compton models do not apply and more complex models need to be developed .",
    "however , one needs to remember that the above discussion is based on averaging x - ray and radio morphologies that do not closely match and ignoring any individual sub - structures that might be present in the jet . as noted at the beginning of the discussion the pks  1127 - 145 jet is about 10 times longer than the 3c  273 jet , while characteristic timescales for energy losses in both jets are similar .",
    "in addition , nearby sources ( e.g. m87 or cen a ) show that jets have smaller scale structures that can not be resolved in the higher redshift sources .",
    "the x - ray and radio morphology and spectral properties of the pks 1127 - 145 jet are similar to the 3c 273 jet , indicating that the 3c  273 jet is not unusual but a representative case for other quasar jets .",
    "the homogeneous one - zone ( either ic / cmb or synchrotron ) models are not consistent with the pks  1127 - 145 x - ray and radio data , and their adiabatic versions can be rejected in general .",
    "a possible solution is a model in which the radio emission is produced within a jet sheath , while the x - rays come from the proper jet .",
    "this implies possibly a much different spectral and spatial evolution of the x - ray and radio spectra .",
    "in addition to this , we speculate that the jet intermittency also plays a role in shaping the observed jet morphology in pks 1127 - 145 .",
    "one needs to remember that the two highest redshift x - ray jets known to date ( gb 1508 + 5714 , siemiginowska et al . 2003 ; 1745 + 624 , cheung et al .",
    "2006 ) are faint and the resolution scale in x - rays is of order @xmath92  kpc .",
    "thus the conclusions about the dominant emission processes are based on averaging over unknown jet structures .",
    "statistical analysis of large samples of high redshift jets may be the only method available to study jet properties and their impact on the environment in the early universe .",
