    ", we show that simulations of muon showers and veritas telescope 1 reproduce the muon energy spectrum , maximum cherenkov angle , and the light collection efficiency of the telescope .",
    "veritas telescope 1@xcite is sited at the whipple observatory basecamp on mt .",
    "hopkins , at an altitude of @xmath0 .",
    "the telescope has a @xmath1 diameter reflector and a @xmath2 photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) camera read out by @xmath3 fadcs .",
    "the pmts are photonis xp2970/02 .",
    "the pixel spacing is @xmath4 .",
    "telescope 1 has been taking data since january , 2005@xcite ; the 5.6 hours of data used in this analysis were taken during may 9 - 13 , 2005 at an average zenith angle of @xmath5 40 .",
    "light cones had not yet been installed when this data was taken .",
    "cherenkov light is produced by charged particles when their speed exceeds the speed of light in the ambient medium , @xmath6 . at the altitude of telescope 1 , the threshold energy for a muon to produce cherenkov light is @xmath7 , and the cherenkov angle of a @xmath8 muon is within 0.01  of its maximum value of 1.32 .",
    "simulated muons are generated using corsika 6.031@xcite for the air showers and grisu@xcite for the detector simulation .",
    "muons are scattered with impact parameters within a radius of @xmath9 and at angles up to 1  off the telescope axis .",
    "they are injected at a distance of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 vertical distance ) from the telescope .",
    "the atmosphere is modelled using a corsika external atmosphere appropriate for midlatitude winter ( discussed below ) and atmospheric extinction is modelled using modtran 4@xcite .",
    "measurements of the mirror reflectivity are used over the range @xmath12 , and are extrapolated down to @xmath13 . the pmt quantum efficiency ( qe )",
    "is taken from manufacturer specifications covering the full range @xmath14 .",
    "fadc traces which are not part of an image are extracted from the data runs and used to provide pedestal traces for the simulations to accurately reproduce fluctuations from night - sky background and electronics noise .",
    "individual pixel gains and timing offsets are also applied to the simulations .",
    "a broken power law is used for the energy spectrum , with the spectral indices inferred from  @xcite : indices of @xmath15 and @xmath16 over the energy ranges @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "equal numbers of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are simulated .",
    "images are characterized according to a circle fit , minimizing the function @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the signal amplitude in pixel @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the fit parameters of the circle , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the coordinates of the @xmath29 pixel in the image .",
    "a two - pass fitting procedure is used : after the first pass , pixels which are more than 0.3  away from the circle are thrown out , and the image is fit again .",
    "this procedure improves the fit in cases where a muon is accompanied by light from an associated hadronic shower .",
    "figure  [ fig : muon ] shows a muon image recorded by the veritas telescope 1 camera .",
    "the black circle is a fit to the image .",
    "r0.5        muon images are selected from the data files on the basis of a number of cuts :    * hillas width@xcite of the image ( length of the semi - minor axis ) @xmath30 , * image size ( sum of fadc signals in pixels included in the 2nd - pass fit ) @xmath31 digital counts ( dc ) , * rms timespread in the arrival of light in the pixels @xmath32 , * rms width of the cherenkov ring @xmath33 , * completeness of the ring ( @xmath34 of azimuthal bins with a size above a 50-dc threshold ) , * ring center within 0.4  of the center of the field of view , and * a negligible change in ring parameters between the first- and second - pass fits .",
    "these cuts select complete and nearly complete rings with very little contamination from hadronic showers . except where otherwise noted ,",
    "all results below utilize all of the above cuts .    following the application of cuts , the simulated and data image size distributions",
    "are compared , and a scale factor @xmath35 is determined . if necessary , a second set of simulated muons is then generated with the pmt qe scaled by @xmath36 , independent of wavelength .",
    "this process is repeated until @xmath36 converges to unity .",
    "the net required change in qe is then a measure of our understanding of the telescope s light collection efficiency .",
    "the results shown below required no iteration .",
    "figure  [ fig : finver ] shows that the simulated muons reproduce basic characteristics of the data reasonably well . in each case , the simulated curves have been rescaled so that the area of the simulated histogram ( dotted line ) equals that of the data histogram ( solid line ) .",
    "in addition , the simulated image sizes ( figure  [ fig : finver]a ) have been rescaled by @xmath36 = 1.0034 so that their mean equals that of the data .",
    "the distribution of rescaled simulation image sizes agrees well with the data .",
    "the distributions of muon angles with respect to the telescope optic axis ( figure  [ fig : finver]b , with cut at 0.4  removed ) and the azimuthal distributions of light ( figure  [ fig : finver]c ) also agree well , showing that the simulations sample the same distribution of off - axis angles and impact parameters as the data .",
    "the shape of the cherenkov angle distribution ( figure  [ fig : finver]d ) depends on the muon energy spectrum , and it is likely that the muon spectrum is softer than assumed at a zenith angle of 40 .",
    "the maximum cherenkov angle depends on the index of refraction near the observation level ; the good agreement ( within @xmath37 between simulations and data on the maximum cherenkov angle ( @xmath38 ) is achieved by using an atmospheric model appropriate for midlatitude winter . a more appropriate model , the us 1976 standard atmosphere , underestimated the maximum cherenkov angle by @xmath39 .",

    "]    the dc / pe ratio is calculated from simulations as in figure  [ fig : dcperatio ] by selecting simulated events that pass the above cuts and fitting a line to a plot of the size in digital counts ( dc ) of the ring versus the number of photoelectrons generated by the simulation .",
    "the dc / pe ratio is the slope of the line , @xmath40 , which is in good agreement with the value found via special laser runs , @xmath41",
    ". it also agrees with the expected value of 5.57 based on the design parameters of the electronics chain , which verifies that the simulation is working as expected .",
    "if we take the dc / pe ratio as well measured , then we can use the scale factor @xmath36 to verify our understanding of the telescope s light collection efficiency .",
    "the telescope s light collection efficiency is determined by several factors : atmospheric extinction and scattering , mirror reflectivity , pmt qe , and the packing fraction of the camera . for this work",
    ", it is convenient to scale the pmt qe by @xmath36 . by iteratively generating simulated muons , each time scaling the pmt qe",
    ", we can determine the adjustment to the collection efficiency required to achieve @xmath42 .",
    "we find that the base simulation , modified to include the extrapolation of mirror reflectivity over @xmath43 , reproduces the telescope s collection efficiency to within @xmath44 on the first iteration .",
    "an earlier    r0.5        series of iterations which neglected this extrapolation required an efficiency adjustment of @xmath45 , consistent with the indication from simulations that for local muons approximately @xmath46 of the detected light is below @xmath47 .",
    "note that for gamma rays the contribution below @xmath47 to the detected light is negligible .",
    "comparison of muon rings in veritas telescope 1 data with simulations demonstrate that the simulation of the veritas telescopes reproduces well the properties of the images . combined with measurements of the single - pe amplitude via dedicated laser runs",
    ", this study shows that the base simulation reasonably reproduces the light - collection efficiency of the telescope .",
    "a dedicated high - multiplicity trigger is planned which will allow the individual telescopes of the veritas array to acquire muon images concurrent with regular data taking for continuous monitoring of the telescopes absolute gain and light collection efficiency .",
