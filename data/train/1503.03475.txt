    "water is an essential ingredient for life as we know it @xcite . in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky - way and also in external galaxies , water has been observed in the gas phase and as grain surface ice in a wide variety of environments .",
    "these environments include diffuse and dense molecular clouds , photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) , shocked gas , protostellar envelopes , and disks ( see review by @xcite ) . in diffuse and translucent clouds ,",
    "h@xmath1o is formed mainly in gas phase reactions via ion - molecule sequences @xcite .",
    "the ion - molecule reaction network is driven by cosmic - ray or x - ray ionization of h and h@xmath1 , that leads to the formation of h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 ions .",
    "these interact with atomic oxygen and form oh@xmath2 .",
    "a series of abstractions then lead to the formation of h@xmath4o@xmath2 , which makes oh and h@xmath1o through dissociative recombination .",
    "this formation mechanism is generally not very efficient , and only a small fraction of the oxygen is converted into water , the rest remains in atomic form , or freezes out as water ice @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the abundance of water vapor within diffuse clouds in the galaxy is remarkably constant , with @xmath5 , that is @xmath6 of the available oxygen . here",
    "@xmath7 is the h@xmath1o number density relative to the total hydrogen nuclei number density . towards the galactic center this value",
    "can be enhanced by up to a factor of @xmath8 @xcite .    at temperatures @xmath9",
    "k , h@xmath1o may form directly via the neutral - neutral reactions , o + h@xmath1 @xmath10 oh + h , followed by oh + h@xmath1 @xmath10 h@xmath1o + h. this formation route is particularly important in shocks , where the gas heats up to high temperatures , and can drive most of the oxygen into h@xmath1o @xcite .",
    "temperatures of a few hundreds k are also expected in very low metallicity gas environments , with elemental oxygen and carbon abundances of @xmath11 solar @xcite , associated with the epochs of the first enrichment of the ism with heavy elements , in the first generation of galaxies at high redshifts @xcite . at such low metallicities , cooling by fine structure transitions of metal species such as",
    "the [ cii ] @xmath12  @xmath13 m line , and by rotational transitions of heavy molecules such as co , becomes inefficient and the gas remains warm .",
    "could the enhanced rate of h@xmath1o formation via the neutral - neutral sequence in such warm gas , compensate for the low oxygen abundance at low metallicities ?",
    "@xcite studied the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas clumps at low metallicities .",
    "they found that for models with gas metallicities of @xmath14 solar , @xmath7 may reach @xmath15 , but only if the density , @xmath16 , of the gas approaches @xmath17  cm@xmath0 .",
    "photodissociation of molecules by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation was not included in their study . while at solar metallicity dust - grains shield the interior of gas clouds from the fuv radiation , at low metallicities photodissociation by fuv becomes a major removal process for h@xmath1o .",
    "photodissociation produces oh , which is then itself photodissociated into atomic oxygen .",
    "@xcite developed a theoretical model to study the abundances of various molecules , including h@xmath1o , in pdrs .",
    "their model included many important physical processes , such as freezeout of gas species , grain surface chemistry , and also photodissociation by fuv photons .",
    "however they focused on solar metallicity .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite report a water abundance close to @xmath15 in the optically thick core of their single pdr model for a low metallicity of 10@xmath19 ( with @xmath20  cm@xmath0 )",
    ". however , bayet et al .  did not investigate the effects of temperature and uv intensity variations on the water abundance in the low metallicity regime .",
    "recently , a comprehensive study of molecular abundances for the bulk ism gas as functions of the metallicity , were studied by @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bs15 ) , these models however , focused on the  low temperature \" ion - molecule formation chemistry .    in this _ letter",
    "_ we present results for the h@xmath1o abundance in low metallicity gas environments , for varying temperatures , fuv intensities and gas densities .",
    "we demonstrate the importance of the onset of the neutral - neutral formation sequence , and explore the role of the fuv field .",
    "we find that for temperatures @xmath21 in the range @xmath22 k , h@xmath1o may be abundant , comparable to or higher than that found in diffuse galactic clouds , provided that the fuv intensity to density ratio is smaller than a critical value . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] we discuss our physical and chemical model .",
    "we present our results in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "finally we summarize and discuss our conclusions in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we calculate the abundance of gas - phase h@xmath1o for low metallicity gas parcels , that are exposed to external fuv radiation and cosmic - ray and/or x - ray fluxes . given our chemical network we solve the steady state rate equations using our dedicated newton - based solver , and obtain @xmath7 as function of @xmath21 and the fuv intensity to density ratio .",
    "we adopt a 10@xmath23  k diluted blackbody spectrum , representative of radiation produced by massive pop - iii stars . the photon density in the 6 - 13.6 ev interval ,",
    "is @xmath24 , where @xmath25  photons  cm@xmath0 is the photon density in the interstellar radiation field ( isrf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is the  normalized intensity \" .",
    "thus @xmath26 corresponds to the fuv intensity in the draine isrf .",
    "cosmic - ray and/or x - ray ionization drive the ion - molecule chemical network .",
    "we assume an ionization rate per hydrogen nucleon @xmath27 ( s@xmath28 ) . in the galaxy , @xcite and",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath27 lies within the relatively narrow range @xmath29  s@xmath28 .",
    "we therefore introduce the  normalized ionization rate \" @xmath30  s@xmath31 .",
    "the ionization rate and the fuv intensity are likely correlated , as both should scale with the formation rate of massive ob stars .",
    "we thus set @xmath32 as our fiducial case but also consider the cases @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "dust shielding against the fuv radiation becomes ineffective at low metallicities .",
    "however , self absorption in the h@xmath1 lines may significantly attenuate the destructive lyman werner ( 11.2 - 13.6 ev ) radiation @xcite and high abundances of h@xmath1 may be maintained even at low metallicity ( bs15 ) . in the models presented here",
    "we assume an h@xmath1 shielding column of at least @xmath35  cm@xmath19 .",
    "( for such conditions co is also shielded by the h@xmath1 . )",
    "the lw flux is then attenuated by a self - shielding factor of @xmath37 and the h@xmath1 photodissociation rate is only @xmath38  s@xmath28 . with this assumption",
    "h@xmath1 photodissociation by lw photons is negligible compared to cosmic - ray and/or x - ray ionization as long as @xmath39 .",
    "however , even when the lyman werner band is fully blocked , oh and h@xmath1o are photodissociated because their energy thresholds for photodissociation are @xmath40 and 6 ev , respectively . for the low metallicities that we consider , photodissociation is generally the dominant removal mechanism for h@xmath1o and oh . we adopt the calculated oh and h@xmath1o photodissociation rates calculated by bs15 .    we assume thermal and chemical steady states . in the milky way , the bulk of the ism gas is considered to be at approximate thermal equilibrium , set by cooling and heating processes .",
    "we discuss the relevant chemical and thermal time - scales in  [ sub : time scales ] .    given the above mentioned assumptions , the steady state solutions for the species abundances depend on only two parameters , the temperature @xmath21 and the intensity to density ratio @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the total number density of hydrogen nuclei normalized to typical molecular cloud densities . @xmath21 and form our basic parameter space in our study .",
    "we consider a chemical network of 503 two - body reactions , between 56 atomic , molecular and ionic species of h , he , c , o , s , and si . we assume cosmological elemental helium abundance of 0.1 relative to hydrogen ( by number ) . for the metal elemental abundances",
    "we adopt the @xcite photospheric solar abundances , multiplied by a metallicity factor @xmath44 ( i.e. , @xmath45 is solar metallicity ) . in our fiducial model",
    "we assume @xmath46 , but we also explore cases with @xmath47 and @xmath48 . since our focus here is on the very low metallicity regime , where dust grains play a lesser role , we neglect any depletion on dust grains , and dust - grain chemistry ( except for h@xmath1 , as discussed further below ) .",
    "direct and induced ionizations and dissociations by the cosmic - ray / x - ray field ( @xmath49 ) are included .",
    "for the gas phase reactions , we adopt the rate coefficients given by the umist 2012 database @xcite .",
    "the formation of heavy molecules relies on molecular hydrogen .",
    "we consider two scenarios for h@xmath1 formation : ( a ) pure gas - phase formation ; and ( b ) gas - phase formation plus formation on dust grains . in gas - phase , radiative - attachment @xmath50 followed by associative - detachment @xmath51 is the dominant h@xmath1 formation route .",
    "h@xmath1 formation on the surface of dust grains is considered to be the dominant formation channel in the milky way .",
    "we adopt a standard rate coefficient @xmath52 @xcite , where @xmath53  k@xmath54 . in this expression",
    "we assume that the dust - to - gas ratio is linearly proportional to the metallicity @xmath44 .",
    "thus , in scenario ( b ) h@xmath1 formation on dust grains dominates even for @xmath46 .",
    "scenario ( a ) is the limit where the gas - phase channel dominates , as appropriate for dust - free environments or for superlinear dependence of the dust - to - gas ratio on @xmath44 ( see also bs15 ) .",
    "the timescale for the system to achieve chemical steady state is dictated by the relatively long h@xmath1 formation timescale . in the gas phase ( scenario [ a ] )",
    "it is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the electron fraction as set by ionization recombination equilibrium , and @xmath57  @xmath58  s@xmath28 is the rate coefficient for reaction ( [ r : h- form ] ) .    for formation on dust grains ( @xmath59 )",
    ", the timescale is generally shorter , with @xmath60 gas clouds with lifetimes @xmath61 will reach chemical steady state .",
    "the relevant timescale for thermal equilibrium is the cooling timescale . for low metallicity gas with @xmath46 , the cooling proceeds mainly via h@xmath1 rotational excitations @xcite .",
    "if the cooling rate per h@xmath1 molecule ( in erg s@xmath28 ) is @xmath62 , then the cooling timescale is given by @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant . for @xmath65  cm@xmath0 , and @xmath66",
    "k , @xmath67  erg  s@xmath28 @xcite , and the cooling time is very short @xmath68 yr . for densities much smaller than the critical density for h@xmath1 cooling , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the opposite limit , @xmath71 saturates and @xmath72 becomes independent of density .",
    "we see that generally @xmath73 .    because the free fall time @xmath74 is generally much shorter than @xmath75 , chemical steady state may be achieved only in stable , non - collapsing clouds , with lifetimes @xmath76 .",
    "obviously both @xmath75 and @xmath72 must be also shorter than the hubble time at the redshift of interest .",
    "next we present and discuss our results for the steady state , gas - phase h@xmath1o fraction @xmath77 , as function of temperature @xmath21 , and the fuv intensity to density ratio @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ fig : h2o_t_uv ] shows @xmath78 contours for the two scenarios described in   [ sub : chemical model ] . in one h@xmath1 forms in pure gas - phase ( scenario [ a ] - left panel ) , and in the other h@xmath1 forms also on dust - grains ( scenario [ b ] - right panel ) .",
    "our fiducial parameters are @xmath46 and @xmath79 . at the upper - left region of the parameter space , @xmath80 is generally low @xmath81 . in this regime ,",
    "h@xmath1o forms through the ion - molecule sequence , that is operative at low temperatures . in the lower right corner ,",
    "the neutral - neutral reactions become effective and 2o rises .    in both panels ,",
    "the solid line highlights the @xmath82 contour , which resembles the h@xmath1o gas phase abundance in diffuse and translucent galactic clouds .",
    "this line also delineates the borderline between the regimes where h@xmath1o forms via the  cold \" ion - molecule sequence , and the  warm \" neutral - neutral sequence .",
    "the temperature range at which the neutral - neutral sequence kicks - in is relatively narrow @xmath83  k , because the neutral - neutral reactions are limited by energy barriers that introduce an exponential dependence on temperature .",
    "the dependence on is introduced because the fuv photons photodissociate oh and h@xmath1o molecules and therefore increase the removal rate of h@xmath1o and at the same time suppress formation via the oh + h@xmath1 reaction .",
    "this gives rise to a critical value for @xmath41 below which h@xmath1o may become abundant .",
    "for pure gas - phase h@xmath1 formation ( scenario [ a ] - left panel ) , the gas remains predominantly atomic , and h@xmath1o formation is less efficient . in this case",
    "@xmath84 only when is smaller than a critical value of @xmath85 however , when h@xmath1 formation on dust is included ( scenario [ b ] - right panel ) , the hydrogen becomes fully molecular , and h@xmath1o formation is then more efficient . in this case",
    "@xmath80 may reach 10@xmath86 for @xmath41 smaller than @xmath87 an order of magnitude larger than for the pure - gas phase formation scenario .      in figure",
    "[ fig : variations ] we investigate the effects of variations in the value of @xmath44 and the normalization @xmath88 .",
    "the figure shows the @xmath82 contours for scenarios ( a ) ( left panels ) and ( b ) ( right panels ) . as discussed above , h@xmath1o is generally more abundant in scenario ( b ) because the hydrogen is fully molecular in this case , and therefore the 10@xmath86 contours are located at higher values in both right panels .",
    "the upper panels show the effect of variations in the metallicity value @xmath44 , for our fiducial normalization @xmath79 . in both panels ,",
    "the oxygen abundance rises , and @xmath80 increases with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "thus at higher @xmath44 , the 10@xmath86 contours shift to lower @xmath21 and higher @xmath41 and vice versa .",
    "an exception is the behavior of the @xmath47 curve , for which the metallicity is already high enough so that reactions with metal species dominate h@xmath1o removal for @xmath89 .",
    "the increase in metallicity then results in a _ decrease _ of the h@xmath1o abundance , and the 10@xmath86 contour shifts to the right . for @xmath90 removal by fuv dominates and",
    "the behavior is similar to that in the @xmath46 and @xmath48 cases .",
    "the lower panels show the effects of variations in the ionization rate normalization @xmath88 for our fiducial metallicity value of @xmath46 .",
    "first we consider the pure gas phase formation case ( scenario [ a ] - lower left panel ) . for the two cases @xmath91 and 10@xmath28 , the h@xmath1o removal is dominated by fuv photodissociation and therefore is independent of @xmath27 . as shown by bs15 ,",
    "the h@xmath1o formation rate is also independent of @xmath27 when the h@xmath1 forms in the gas - phase .",
    "therefore 2o is essentially independent of @xmath27 and the contours overlap . for the high ionization rate @xmath92 ,",
    "the proton abundance becomes high , and h@xmath1o reactions with h@xmath2 dominate h@xmath1o removal . in this limit",
    "2o decreases with @xmath27 and the 10@xmath86 contour moves down .    when h@xmath1 forms on dust ( scenario [ b ] - lower right panel ) , the h@xmath1o formation rate via the ion - molecule sequence is proportional to the h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 abundances , which rise with @xmath27 .",
    "since the gas is molecular , the proton fraction is low and the removal is always dominated by fuv photodissociations ( independent of @xmath27 ) . therefore , in this case @xmath80 _ increases _ with @xmath88 and the curves shift up and to the left , toward lower @xmath21 and higher @xmath41 .",
    "in this _ letter _ we have demonstrated that the h@xmath1o gas phase abundance may remain high even at very low metallicities of @xmath93 .",
    "the onset of the efficient neutral - neutral formation sequence at @xmath94  k , may compensate for the low metallicity , and form h@xmath1o in abundance similar to that found in diffuse clouds in the milky way .",
    "we have considered two scenarios for h@xmath1 formation , representing two limiting cases , one in which h@xmath1 is formed in pure gas phase ( scenario [ a ] ) , and one in which h@xmath1 forms both in gas - phase and on dust grains , assuming that the dust abundance scales linearly with @xmath44 ( scenario [ b ] ) .",
    "recent studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , suggest that the dust abundance might decrease faster then linearly with decreasing @xmath44 . as shown by bs15 , for @xmath46 and dust abundance that scales as @xmath95 with @xmath96 , h@xmath1 formation",
    "is dominated by the gas phase formation channel .",
    "therefore our scenario ( a ) is also applicable for models in which dust grains are present , with an abundance that scales superlinearly with @xmath44 .",
    "for both scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) we have found that the neutral - neutral formation channel yields @xmath97 , provided that @xmath41 is smaller than a critical value .",
    "for the first scenario we have found that this critical value is @xmath98 . for the second scenario @xmath99 .",
    "in our analysis we have assumed that the system had reached a chemical steady state . for initially atomic ( or ionized ) gas",
    ", this assumption offers the best conditions for the formation of molecules .",
    "however , chemical steady state might not always be achieved within a cloud lifetime or even within the hubble time .",
    "the timescale to achieve chemical steady state ( from an initially dissociated state ) is dictated by the h@xmath1 formation process , and is generally long at low metallicities . for @xmath46 and our fiducial parameters ,",
    "the timescales for both scenarios are of order of a few 10@xmath100 years ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and are comparable to the age of the universe at redshifts of @xmath101 .",
    "the generically high water abundances we find for warm conditions and low metallicities will be maintained in dynamically evolving systems so long as they remain h@xmath1-shielded .",
    "our results might have interesting implications for the question of how early could have life originated in the universe @xcite .",
    "our study addresses the first step of h@xmath1o formation in early enriched , molecular gas clouds .",
    "if such a cloud is to collapse and form a protoplanetary disk , some of the h@xmath1o may make its way to the surfaces of forming planets @xcite .",
    "however , the question of to what extent the h@xmath1o molecules that were formed in the initial molecular clouds , are preserved all the way through the process of planet formation , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
