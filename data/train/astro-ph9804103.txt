    "the discovery of bl lac objects and the paradoxes associated with their violent variability led to a major step forward in the theory of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , that is to the concept of relativistic jets .",
    "flat spectrum , radio  loud quasars ( angel & stockman 1980 ) share basically all of the properties of bl lac objects related to the presence of a strong non  thermal broad band continuum , except for the absence of broad emission lines .",
    "hence the common designation of blazars proposed by ed spiegel in 1978 .",
    "it was initially supposed that bl lacs represented the most extreme version of fsrqs , i.e. those with the most highly boosted continuum .",
    "instead , it has been recognized later ( e.g. ghisellini , madau & persic 1987 ; padovani 1992a ; ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 ) that the _ amount of relativistic beaming _ and the _ intrinsic _ power in the lines are lower in bl lacs than in fsrqs , implying some intrinsic difference between the two classes .",
    "differences are also found in the extended radio emission and jet structure ( e.g. padovani 1992a ; gabuzda et al .",
    "nevertheless the continuity of several observational properties including the luminosity functions ( maraschi & rovetti 1994 ) , the radio to x  ray seds ( sambruna et al .",
    "1996 ) and the luminosity of the lines ( scarpa & falomo 1997 ) suggests that blazars can still be considered as a single family , where the physical processes are essentially similar allowing for some scaling factor(s ) .",
    "the identification of these scaling factors would represent a substantial progress in the understanding of the blazar phenomenon .",
    "a special class of bl lacs was found from identification of x  ray sources .",
    "x  ray selected bl lacs ( xbl ) differ from the classical radio  selected bl lacs ( rbl ) in a lesser degree of `` activity '' ( including polarization ) , in the radio to optical emission and in the relative intensity of their x  ray and radio emission .",
    "this led to the suggestion that the x  ray radiation was less beamed than the radio one and that xbls were observed at larger inclination to the jet axis ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 for a review ) .",
    "giommi & padovani ( 1994 ) quantified the differences in seds between xbls and rbls , and padovani & giommi ( 1995 ) introduced the distinction between high  energy peak bl lacs ( hbl ) and low  energy peak bl lacs ( lbl ) , for objects which emit most of their synchrotron power at high ( uv  soft  x ) or low ( far  ir , near ",
    "ir ) frequencies respectively .",
    "quantitatively a distinction can be done on the basis of the ratio between radio and x - ray fluxes ( see also  3.2.2 ) .",
    "we will use the broad band spectral index @xmath3 .",
    "in broad band indices radio , optical and x  ray fluxes are taken at 5 ghz , 5500   and 1 kev , respectively . ] and call hbl and lbl objects having @xmath4 , @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "giommi and padovani also proposed that hbl represent a small fraction of the bl lac population and are numerous in x  ray surveys only due to selection effects .",
    "an alternative hypothesis ( fossati et al . 1997 ) relates the spectral properties to the source luminosity in such a way that low luminosity objects ( with high space density ) are hbls while high luminosity objects ( with low space density ) are lbls .",
    "we will include here x ",
    "ray selected bl lacs together with `` classical '' bl lacs in the blazar family , again assuming that the basic physical processes by which the continuum is produced are common to the whole family .",
    "the detection by egret , on board the compton gamma  ray observatory ( cgro ) , of many blazars at @xmath0ray energies ( e @xmath6 mev ) revealed that a substantial fraction and in some cases the bulk of their power is emitted in this very high energy band .",
    "the @xmath0ray emission is therefore of fundamental importance in the sed of blazars .    from the theoretical point of view the radio to uv continuum",
    "is universally attributed to synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet , while a flat inverse compton component due to upscattering of the low energy photons is expected to emerge at high energies as originally discussed in jones , odell & stein ( 1974 ) .",
    "the latter process is therefore a plausible candidate to explain the @xmath0ray emission .",
    "the soft photons to be upscattered could be either the synchrotron photons themselves ( synchrotron self  compton process , ssc , e.g. maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 ; bloom & marscher 1993 ) or photons produced by the disk and/or scattered /reprocessed in the broad line region ( blandford 1993 ; dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ; ghisellini & madau 1996 ) . understanding whether / how the @xmath0ray properties differ among subclasses is essential to assess the role of different mechanisms and to verify whether the idea of blazars as a unitary class can be maintained .",
    "here we study the systematics of the seds of blazars using data from the radio to the @xmath0-ray band .",
    "we confirm and extend previous results of maraschi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) by : i ) _ extending the sed to the @xmath0-ray range _ ; ii ) using a much larger complete sample of fsrq ; iii ) using the richer and brighter sample of x  ray selected bl lacs recently derived from the slew survey .",
    "we use the available @xmath0ray data for each sample but also indirect information derived from the @xmath0ray detected ( not complete ) sample discussed by comastri et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . since we find that the continuity hypothesis among blazars holds we also consider a merged `` global '' sample subdivided in luminosity bins irrespective of the original classification of the objects .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe how the data for the seds were collected and treated for each sample .",
    "the @xmath0ray properties of different samples are also discussed . in section 3",
    "we build average seds for the three sub  samples and for the global sample subdivided according to luminosity and present our results .",
    "these are discussed in section 4 , while our conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "we decided to consider the following three samples of blazars : the slew survey sample and the 1 jy sample of bl lac objects and the fsrq sample derived from the 2 jy sample of wall & peacock ( 1985 ) , motivated by the need of completeness , sufficient number of objects and observational coverage at other frequencies , as detailed below .",
    "the _ einstein _ slew survey ( elvis 1992 ) was derived from data taken with the ipc while the telescope scanned the sky in between different pointings .",
    "it has limited sensitivity ( flux limit of @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 in the ipc band [ 0.3 @xmath10 3.5 kev ] ) , but covers a large fraction of the sky ( @xmath2 36000 deg@xmath11 ) . in a restricted region of the sky",
    "perlman ( 1996a ) selected a sample of 48 bl lacs ( 40 hbl , 8 lbl ) which can be regarded as being practically complete .",
    "this is the largest available x  ray selected sample of bl lacs .",
    "the redshift is known for 41 out of the 48 objects , and 8/48 have been detected at @xmath0ray energies , ( 6 with egret , e@xmath12 100 mev , 1 with whipple , e@xmath12 0.3 tev , 1652 + 398 , and 1 with both instruments , 1101 + 384 ) .",
    "this is the largest complete radio sample of bl lacs compiled so far .",
    "the complete 1 jy bl lac sample was derived from the catalog of extragalactic sources with @xmath13 jy ( khr 1981 ) with additional requirements on radio flatness ( @xmath14 ) , optical brightness ( @xmath15 ) and the weakness of optical emission lines ( ew@xmath16  , evaluated in the source rest frame ) ( stickel 1991 ) .",
    "this yielded 34 ( 2 hbl , 32 lbl ) sources matching the criteria , 26 with a redshift determination and 4 with a lower limit on it ( stickel , meisenheimer & khr 1994 ) .",
    "out of these 34 objects , 9 have been detected at @xmath0ray energies ( 8 with egret , plus 1 with whipple , 1652 + 398 ) .      for fsrqs we considered the sample drawn by padovani & urry ( 1992 ) from the `` 2 jy sample '' ( wall & peacock 1985 ) , a complete flux ",
    "limited catalogue selected at 2.7 ghz , covering 9.81 sr , and including 233 sources with @xmath17 jy , and @xmath14 .",
    "it consists of 50 sources with almost complete polarization data , of which 20 are detected in @xmath0rays ( all with egret ) .",
    "combining the three samples yields a total of 126 blazars ( six of them are present in both the radio and x  ray selected samples of bl lacs ) , of which 33 detected in @xmath0rays",
    ". we will refer to them as the _ total blazar sample_.      in view of building average seds minimizing the bias introduced by incompleteness , we decided to focus on a few well covered frequencies , at which fluxes are available for most objects . in a separate paper ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) we consider a sub  sample of @xmath0ray loud blazars with extensive coverage in frequency with the scope of carrying out detailed model fitting for each source .",
    "we chose the following seven well sampled frequencies , that are sufficient to give the basic information on the sed shape from the radio to the x  ray band : radio at 5 ghz , millimeter at 230 ghz , far infrared ( iras data ) at 60 and 25 @xmath18 m , near infrared ( k band ) at 2.2 @xmath18 m , optical ( v band ) at 5500  , and soft x ",
    "rays at 1 kev .",
    "data were collected from a careful search in the literature and extensive usage of the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) derived from the a@xmath19 reported in the ned database according to the law a@xmath20 a@xmath21 ( riecke & lebofski 1985 ) ] . in the radio and optical bands the coverage is complete for all the objects in the three samples , while unfortunately for mm , far and near ir and x  ray fluxes data for some sources are lacking ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the worse case is the far ir ( 25 @xmath18 m ) band where only 28/126 objects have measured fluxes .    for each source , at each frequency _",
    "from radio to optical _ we assigned the average of all the fluxes found in literature .",
    "given the large variability these averages were performed logarithmically ( magnitudes ) .    in principle a suitable alternative to the averaging would be to consider in each band the maximum detected flux ( see for instance dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) .",
    "on one hand this choice could be particularly meaningful in view of the fact that in the @xmath0ray band , due to the limited sensitivity of detectors , we are biased towards measuring the brightest states .",
    "on the other hand also this option is biased since the value of the maximum flux is strongly dependent on the observational coverage and for most of the objects we only have a few ( sometimes a single ) observations .",
    "moreover the strength of this bias is band  dependent and can thus significantly affect the determination of the broad band spectral shape . as both choices present advantages and disadvantages , and since our goal is a statistical analysis",
    ", we consider them equally good .",
    "the averages option has been preferred because it is likely to be more robust with respect to the definition of radio  optical sed properties .    in table  1 a summary of the collected broad band data is reported , with the computed average flux values for each object .",
    "the knowledge of the x  ray properties is of special relevance because in this band both the synchrotron and inverse compton processes can contribute to the emission .",
    "since the first mechanism is expected to produce a steep continuum in this band while the second one should give rise to a flat component ( @xmath22 , rising in a @xmath23 plot ) the shape of the x  ray spectrum can give a fundamental hint for disentangling the two components and inferring the respective peak frequencies .",
    "we privileged the large and homogeneous _",
    "rosat _ data base .",
    "in fact , a large fraction of the 126 sources ( 90/126 ) has been observed with the _ rosat _ pspc allowing to uniformly derive x  ray fluxes and in many cases , that is for 73 targets of pointed observations , spectral shapes in the 0.12.4 kev range ( brunner et al .",
    "1994 ; lamer et al . 1996",
    "; perlman et al . 1996b ; urry et al . 1996 ; comastri et al . 1995 , 1997 ; sambruna 1997 ) .",
    "x  ray spectral indices were derived from the same observation and , when available , we adopted the @xmath24 resulting from fits with neutral hydrogen column density n@xmath25 allowed to vary .",
    "some of these 90 objects ( 17 ) have been only detected in the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) and fluxes are published by brinkmann , siebert & boller ( 1994 ) and brinkmann et al .",
    "monochromatic fluxes ( at 1 kev ) for these sources have been derived from the 0.1  2.4 kev integrated flux adopting the average spectral index of the sample to which they belong ( see table  4 ) and the value of the galactic column in the source direction ( elvis et al 1989 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ; lockman & savage 1995 ; murphy et al 1996 ) . when more than one observation was available we give the average flux .    of the remaining 36 sources ,",
    "24 belong to the slew survey sample and for them we used directly the _ einstein _ ipc flux from perlman et al .",
    "( 1996a ) .",
    "the fluxes at 2 kev listed by perlman et al .",
    "( 1996a ) were converted to 1 kev using the average _ rosat _ spectral index of the slew survey sample ( @xmath26 = 1.40 ) , derived from the 24 sources with a _ rosat _ measured value .    for other 3 sources , without rosat data",
    ", we used an _ einstein _",
    "ipc flux , bringing the total number of sources with measured x  ray flux to 117/126 .      within the three samples",
    "only a fraction of blazars were detected in @xmath0rays , namely 9/34 in the 1 jy sample , 8/48 in the slew sample , 20/50 in the fsrq sample .",
    "four of these sources ( 0235 + 164 , 0735 + 178 , 0851 + 202 and 1652 + 398 ) are present in both the bl lac object samples , giving a net number of @xmath0ray detections of 33 out of 126 blazars .",
    "all but one of them have been observed by egret in the 30 mev ",
    "30 gev band . for 28/32 a @xmath0ray spectral index has been determined .",
    "one source , 1652 + 398 ( mkn 501 ) , has only been detected at very high energies , beyond 0.3 tev by ground based cherenkov telescopes ( whipple and hegra , weekes et al .",
    "1996 ; bradbury et al .",
    "1997 ) , while egret yielded only an upper limit .",
    "it is worth noticing that the detected fraction is significantly different between quasars and bl lacs , being respectively @xmath27 % and @xmath28 % for xbls and rbls together .",
    "however for rbls only the fraction detected in @xmath0rays is @xmath29 % , consistent with that of quasars while xbls only yield @xmath30 % .",
    ".basic data for the 30 @xmath0ray detected sources not included in our samples : ( 1 ) : iau name ; ( 2 ) : redshift ; ( 3 ) : radio flux at 5 ghz ; ( 4 ) : @xmath0ray flux at 100 mev ; ( 5 ) : egret spectral index [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     * references to table 3 : *    \\(1 ) stickel et al .",
    "1994 ; ( 2 ) gear et al . 1994 ; ( 3 ) derived from iras data ; ( 4 ) bersanelli et al . 1992 ; ( 5 ) this work , see table  5 .",
    "all fluxes were k - corrected and luminosities were computed with the following choices :    * we considered lower limits on redshift ( 4 sources ) as detections , while we assigned the average redshift of the sample to the few sources without any estimate ( 4 in the 1 jy sample , for which @xmath31 , and 6 in the slew survey sample , @xmath32 ) ; * luminosity distances were calculated adopting h@xmath33=50 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and q@xmath33=0 ; * fluxes were k  corrected according to the following prescriptions . for radio  to  optical data we used average spectral indices derived from the literature ( see table  3 ) .",
    "for x  ray and @xmath0ray data we used measured power law spectral indices , when available , or the average index derived for the sources of the same sample ( see table  3 ) .",
    "since the fraction of objects detected in @xmath0-rays in the three samples is rather small , it is important to ask whether the detected sources are representative of each sample as a whole or are distinguished in other properties from the rest of the objects in it .",
    "moreover we want to verify whether the @xmath0-ray detected sources in general differ from those belonging to the complete samples .",
    "we therefore computed the distributions of various quantities , i.e. redshift , luminosities and broad band spectral indices , for objects belonging to each sample .",
    "these are shown in figs .",
    "15 for the three samples and",
    "the total blazar one , evidentiating those sources detected in the @xmath0ray band as grey shaded areas in the histograms .",
    "the redshift , radio ( at 5ghz ) and x  ray ( at 1kev ) luminosities ( expressed as @xmath34l@xmath35 , erg / sec ) are shown in figs .  13 , while the distributions of the broad band spectral indices @xmath36 and @xmath37 are plotted in figs .  4 and 5 , respectively .    the redshift distributions ( fig",
    ".  1 ) of the three complete samples show the known tendency towards the detection of fsrqs at higher @xmath38 , being the latter ones more powerful radio sources , as shown in fig .  2 .    in the same figure and in fig",
    "3 , the tendency for xbl to have similar x ",
    "ray but lower radio luminosities compared to rbl is also apparent .",
    "correspondingly , it appears from figs .",
    "4,5 that @xmath36 and @xmath37 increase from xbl to rbl while fsrq have @xmath36 slightly larger and @xmath37 similar to rbls .",
    "later on ( section 3.2 ) we will show that there is a relationship between these spectral indices and the peak frequency of the synchrotron component .",
    "we note that for all of the distributions there is continuity in properties not only between the two bl lac samples , but also between bl lacs and fsrqs .",
    "it is clear from figs .  1 - 5 that for the rbl and fsrq samples the @xmath0ray detected sources do not differ from non  detected ones in any of the considered quantities while for the slew sample there is a tendency for @xmath0ray loud sources to have larger l@xmath39 , @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "this indicates that either the radio luminosity or radio  loudness are important in determining the @xmath0ray detection . on the contrary , and in some sense",
    "surprisingly , the x  ray luminosity does not seem to play an important role with respect to the @xmath0ray emission , although the x - ray band is the closest in energy to the @xmath0rays .",
    "we will come back to this issue later on (  3.5 ) .",
    "we checked the possible difference of means and variances of the distributions with the t ",
    "student s test and only for the @xmath37 of the slew sample the significance is higher than 95 per cent .    except for the case of the slew survey , we conclude that the @xmath0ray detected sources are representative of the samples as a whole , being indistinguishable from the others in terms of radio to x - ray broad band properties and power .",
    "we also checked that the @xmath0-ray detected sources belonging to our samples are homogeneous with respect to all of the @xmath0-ray blazars detected so far . in fig .",
    "6 we compare the redshift distributions , the radio luminosities and fluxes and the @xmath0ray spectral index .",
    "the grey shaded areas represent the @xmath0ray sources belonging to the complete samples considered here .",
    "we conclude that there is no significant difference .",
    "nevertheless , we are aware that the limited sensitivity of the egret instrument implies that at a given radio flux , only the @xmath0ray loudest sources are detected . therefore the non detected ones are probably on average weaker in @xmath0-rays .",
    "impey ( 1996 ) quantified this effect by taking into account the correlation between radio and @xmath0ray luminosities ( see  3.3.1 ) , and other observables . assuming a gaussian distribution of the @xmath0ray to radio flux ratio he estimated the width of the distribution and the `` true '' ratio referring to the whole population , which could be a factor 10 lower than the observed one .",
    "there could be a real spread in the intrinsic properties of the blazar population , the @xmath0-ray detected blazars being intrinsically louder than the rest of the population .",
    "alternatively this may be due to variability , i.e. a source is detected only when it undergoes a flare .",
    "the observed ratio would thus refer to flaring states , while the average level of each source would be lower .",
    "since variability is a distinctive property of blazars and has been observed to occur also in @xmath0rays , often with extremely large amplitude ( greater than a factor 10 ) ( 3c 279 , maraschi et al 1994 ; pks 0528 + 134 , mukherjee et al .",
    "1996 ; 1622@xmath10297 , mattox et al .",
    "1997 ) the latter alternative is likely although the problem remains an open one .",
    "we conclude that the average @xmath0ray luminosities computed here are necessarily overestimated .",
    "however we chose not to correct for this effect given the uncertainties .",
    "in particular the `` bias factor '' for different classes of blazars could be different if their @xmath0ray variability properties ( amplitude and duty cycle ) are ( ulrich , maraschi & urry 1997 ) .      as previously noted",
    "the seds clearly show a broad peak between radio and uv  x  rays . in order to determine the position of the peak of the synchrotron component in individual objects with an objective procedure , we fitted the data points for each source ( in a @xmath34 vs. @xmath34l@xmath35 diagram ) with a third degree polynomial , which yields a complex sed profile , with an upturn allowing for x  ray data points not to lay on the direct extrapolation from the lower energy spectrum . in many cases",
    "there is evidence that the x  ray component , even in the soft _ rosat _ pspc band , is due to the inverse compton process ( e.g. sambruna 1997 ; comastri et al .",
    "thus to impose that the x  ray point smoothly connects to the lower energy data , as would happen in a parabolic fit , could be misleading for a determination of the synchrotron peak frequency .",
    "we used a simple parabola when the cubic fit was not able to find a maximum , which typically happens when the peak occurs at energies higher than x  rays .",
    "in fact when the peak moves to high enough frequencies ( typically beyond the ir band ) , the x  ray flux is completely dominated by the synchrotron emission , and the results given by the cubic and parabolic fits are fully consistent . in 8 cases neither the cubic nor the parabolic fit were able to determine a peak frequency / luminosity mainly due to the paucity of data points .",
    "the peak frequencies derived with the above procedure ( defined as the frequencies of the maximum in the fitted polynomial function ) are plotted in fig .",
    "7a , b , c versus the radio and @xmath0ray luminosities and vs the corresponding peak luminosities , as determined from the fits .",
    "let us stress once again the continuity between the different samples .",
    "considering the samples together strong correlations are present between these quantities , in the sense of @xmath40 decreasing with increasing luminosity .",
    "the results of kendall s @xmath41 statistical test ( table 4 ) show that the correlations are highly significant .",
    "since on one hand in flux limited samples spurious correlations can be introduced by the luminosity / redshift relation and on the other hand the correlations might be due to evolutionary effects genuinely related to redshift , we checked its role in two ways .",
    "we estimated the possible correlation of the relevant quantities with redshift directly , and performed partial correlation tests between two quantities subtracting out the common dependence on @xmath38 ( padovani 1992b)(see results in table  4 ) .",
    "in addition , in order to have an independent check on the redshift bias , we also considered the significance of the correlations restricting them to objects with @xmath42 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath40 and l@xmath43 still holds after subtraction of the very strong dependence on redshift .",
    "the same is true for the relation between @xmath40 and the @xmath0-ray luminosity , although the significance is much smaller , due to the smaller number of sources . on the other hand",
    "the correlation between @xmath40 and l@xmath44 is strongly weakened when subtracting the redshift effect .    considering only the @xmath42 interval the significance of the first two correlations persists and does not change when the redshift dependence is subtracted .",

    "a problem arises when @xmath40 moves at energies higher than that used to compute the broad band spectral index .",
    "the reason is that the ratio between , for instance , optical and radio luminosity is no longer sensitive to the peak moving further towards higher frequencies , because both the radio and optical bands lay on the same ( rising ) branch of the synchrotron `` bump '' .    for comparison",
    "we draw in fig .",

    "we would obtain a ratio between the two luminosities higher than that derived considering only the subsample of 10 sources , and presumably higher than the actual one , too .    to reduce this kind of effect we first normalized the monochromatic luminosities to the radio luminosity for each source",
    ", we computed average ratios @xmath58 , considering only the subsample of sources with a measured flux at @xmath59 , and used that ratio to compute the average monochromatic luminosity at @xmath60 for all sources in the sample as @xmath61 . in this way we basically averaged the spectral shape between @xmath59 and 5 ghz for the measured objects and assigned that spectral shape to the sample .",
    "the x  ray and @xmath0ray spectral indices have been averaged with a simple mean , without weighting .",
    "the average broad band spectra for each of the three samples are shown in fig .",
    "the 6 sources common to the radio and the x  ray selected bl lac samples are considered in both of them .",
    "average luminosities entering fig .",
    "10 are reported in table  5 together with the number of sources contributing at each frequency .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "10 that the three samples refer to objects with different average integrated luminosities and that the peak frequency of the power emitted between the radio and the x - ray band moves from the x - ray to the far infrared band going from the xbl to the fsrq samples as anticipated from the analysis of single objects in the previous section 3.2 .",
    "correspondingly the @xmath0ray luminosities increase and the @xmath0ray spectra steepen suggesting that also the peak frequency of the high energy emission moves to lower frequencies .",
    "the overall similarity and regularity of the seds of the different samples as well as the continuity in the properties of the individual objects discussed in section 3.2 suggest a basic similarity of all blazars irrespective of their original classification and different appearance in a specific spectral band .",

    "since in some luminosity bins the number of @xmath0-ray detected sources is small , we used an indirect procedure to associate @xmath0ray fluxes and spectra to our average seds , taking advantage of the whole body of information regarding the @xmath0ray properties of blazars .",
    "namely for each luminosity bin @xmath67l@xmath68 and @xmath69 were computed from blazars in the general egret  detected sample falling into the same l@xmath39 bin .",

    "the resulting seds are shown in fig .",

    "the most interesting result is that the trends pointed out for the three separate sub",
    " classes of blazars ( fig .",
    "10 ) hold for the total blazar sample , irrespective of the original classification of sources , when the radio luminosity is adopted as the key parameter characterizing each object .",
    "in fig .  12 we superimposed to the averaged data a set of ( dashed ) lines , whose main goal is to guide the eye .",
    "the radio  x  ray sed is approximated with a power law starting in the radio domain continuously connecting at @xmath70 hz with a parabolic branch .",
    "this latter describes the peak of the sed and its steepening beyond it . in soft x ",
    "rays a rising power law , representing the onset of the hard inverse compton component is summed to this curved  synchrotron \" component .",
    "the normalization of this second x  ray component is kept fixed relative to the radio one . based on our findings ( see fig .",
    "7a ) , we then assume that the peak frequency of the synchrotron spectral component is ( inversely ) related to radio luminosity .",
    "the simplest hypothesis of a straight unique relationship between @xmath40 and l@xmath39 does not give a good result when compared with the average seds .",
    "we then allow for a different sed ",
    "shape / luminosity dependence for high and low luminosity objects , a distinction that turns out to roughly correspond also to that between objects with and without prominent emission lines .",
    "we adopted a  two  branch \" relationship between @xmath40 and l@xmath39 in the form of two power laws @xmath71 l@xmath72 , with @xmath73 or @xmath74 for log(l@xmath39 ) higher or smaller than 42.5 , respectively .",
    "the shape of the analytic seds is parabolic with a smooth connection to a fixed power law in the radio and the loci of the maxima as defined above .",
    "a full description of the parameterization can be found in fossati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) where a similar scheme was proposed to account for the source number densities of bl lacs with different spectral properties ( lbl and hbl ) .",
    "the analytic representation of the second spectral component ( x  ray to @xmath0rays ) is a parabola of the same width as the synchrotron one , and has been obtained assuming that : ( a ) the ratio of the frequencies of the high and low energy peaks is constant ( @xmath75 ) , ( b ) the high energy ( @xmath0ray ) peak and radio luminosities have a fixed ratio , @xmath76l@xmath77l@xmath78 . given the extreme simplicity of the latter assumptions , it is remarkable that the phenomenological analytic model describes the run of the average seds reasonably well .",
    "the worst case refers to the second luminosity bin : the analytic model predicts a @xmath0-ray luminosity larger than the computed bin average by a factor of 10 ( but predicts the correct spectral shape ) .",
    "we note that only 5 @xmath0ray detected objects fall in this bin .",
    "the results derived from the above analysis ( see in particular figs .",
    "1012 ) can then be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "_ two peaks _ are present in all the seds .",
    "the first one ( synchrotron ) is anticorrelated with the source luminosity ( see figs .  7 and table  4 ) , moving from @xmath79 hz for less luminous sources to @xmath80 hz for the most luminous ones .",
    "the _ x  ray spectrum _ becomes harder while the @xmath0_ray spectrum _ softens with increasing luminosity , indicating that the second ( compton ) peak of the seds also moves to lower frequencies from @xmath81 hz for less luminous sources to @xmath82 hz for the most luminous ones ; 3 .",
    "therefore _ the frequencies of the two peaks are correlated _ : the smaller the @xmath40 the smaller the peak frequency of the high energy component ; a comparison with the analytic curves shows that the data are consistent with a constant ratio between the two peak frequencies ; 4 .   increasing l@xmath39 increases the @xmath0_ray dominance _ , the ratio of the power emitted in the inverse compton and synchrotron components , estimated with the ratio of their respective peak luminosities ( see also fig .",
    "the fact that the trends present when comparing the different samples ( fig .",
    "10 ) , persist when the total blazar sample is considered and binned according to radio luminosity only , suggests that we deal with a _ continuous spectral sequence _ within the blazar family , rather than with separate spectral classes .",
    "in particular the `` continuity '' clearly applies also to the hbl ",
    "lbl subgroups : hbl have the lowest luminosities and the highest peak frequencies .",
    "an interesting result apparent from the average seds is the variety and complexity of behaviour shown in the x  ray band .",
    "as expected the crossing between the synchrotron and inverse compton components can occur below or above the x - ray band affecting the relation between the x  ray luminosity and that in other bands .",
    "a source can be brighter than another at 1 kev being dimmer in the rest of the radio@xmath0ray spectrum except probably in the tev range .",
    "this effect narrows the range of values spanned by l@xmath83 and explains why @xmath0ray detected sources do not select a particular range in the x  ray luminosity distributions ( see fig .",
    "3 ) while this happens for l@xmath39 .    using this simple scheme of sed parameterization we can compute the luminosities in the egret ( 30 mev  3 gev ) and whipple ( 0.3  10 tev ) bands .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "13 ( bottom panel ) together with their ratio with the radio and x  ray luminosities ( top and middle panel respectively ) .",
    "it is easy to recognize that for a given radio flux sources with @xmath40 around @xmath84 have the largest relative flux in the egret band , because the peak of the compton component falls right there ( fig .  13 , top panel ) .",
    "for higher values of @xmath40 the @xmath0ray peak moves to higher energies too and the contribution in the egret band is reduced . for sufficiently high",
    "@xmath40 the @xmath0ray peak reaches the tev band where it becomes detectable .    qualitatively the same general behaviour is present also in the ratios between egret / whipple fluxes and the x  ray one ( fig .  13 , middle panel ) .",
    "there are however a couple of significant differences : firstly the egret / x  ray ratio profile , while still peaking around @xmath84 hz , is sharper than in the egret / radio case , secondly the tev relative flux distribution is broader and skewed towards lower values of the synchrotron peak frequency .",
    "thus , for a given x  ray flux ( as would be the case in a flux limited x  ray selected sample ) only those sources falling in the restricted interval @xmath85 hz would have a flux in the egret band high enough to be detectable . on the other hand , for the tev band",
    "it turns out that the chance of being observable is not confined to very extreme hbls , with x - ray synchrotron peaks , but also intermediate bl lacs could reach a comparable tev flux .",
    "since @xmath40 is directly related to both @xmath36 and @xmath37 we can understand now the tendency ( section 3.1 ) of @xmath0ray detected sources in the slew survey to have larger values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that in the slew sample lbls are only a small fraction , the discussion above explains also the lower egret detection rate with respect to other blazar samples .",
    "the proposed scenario relates the shape of the continuum to the total source power .",
    "it follows that predictions of this unifying scheme on both the detectability of blazars at @xmath0ray energies ( in view of more sensitive @xmath0ray detectors , glast , improved cherenkov telescopes , etc . ) , and their contribution to the @xmath0ray diffuse background depend on the combined effects of the sed shape , the luminosity functions and possibly evolution ( fossati et al . , in preparation ; see also stecker , de jager & salamon 1996 ) .",
    "in particular , an interesting and testable prediction of the scheme is the absence of high luminosity sources with synchrotron peaks in the x - ray range and strong associated tev emission .",
    "the extreme `` regularity '' of the seds of blazars and in particular the trends discussed above must derive from the common underlying physical processes .",
    "the common scenario envisaged is that of a relativistic jet pointing close to the line of sight . assuming the simple case of a single ( homogeneous ) zone model the shape of the sed depends on the spectrum of the high energy electrons radiating via synchrotron and inverse compton , the magnetic field and the nature of seed photons for the inverse compton process .",
    "the latter could be the synchrotron photons themselves ( synchrotron self compton , ssc ) or photons outside the jet (  external compton \" ec ) . in the following we discuss qualitatively the implications of the suggested trends for the two scenarios .",
    "let us assume a constant bulk lorentz factors in all blazars .",
    "should the ( homogeneous ) ssc model be valid for all sources , it is easy to see that the ( approximately ) constant ratio between the high and low peak frequencies yields an ( approximately ) constant value for the energy of the particles radiating at the peaks ( e.g. ghisellini , maraschi , dondi 1996 ) .",
    "if the energy of the radiating particles is similar in all sources the different peak frequencies should result from a systematic variation in magnetic field strength , hbls having the highest , fsrqs the lowest random field intensity .",
    "should instead the soft photons upscattered to the @xmath0ray range be produced outside the jet at a `` typical '' frequency ( the same for all sources ) the condition of a constant ratio between the peak frequencies implies a constant value of the magnetic field ( ghisellini , maraschi , dondi 1996 ) . as a consequence",
    "the energy of the particles radiating at the peaks should vary along the spectral sequence being lower in fsrqs and higher in hbls .",
    "it could also be that there is a smooth transition between the ssc and ec mechanisms depending on the physical conditions outside the jet . in all cases",
    "however the role of the luminosity , which phenomenologically appears dominant , does not find an immediate physical justification , although one could find plausible arguments to link it to the parameters mentioned above and in particular to the conditions surrounding the jet .    in a separate paper ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) , we perform model fits to the spectral energy distributions of 51 individual objects , deriving the ( model dependent ) physical parameters for each source .",
    "these computations indeed suggest the idea that the blazar sequence follows from a transition from the ssc to the ec scenario , rbls being the intermediate objects .",
    "the computed radiation energy densities , which determine the amount of radiative cooling , increase with increasing source luminosity and may be responsible for the lower energy of the particles radiating at the peaks in higher luminosity sources .",
    "the likely possibility that the external photon field involved in the ec process is ( or is related to ) the radiation reprocessed as broad emission lines , seems to be at least qualitatively in agreement with the observational evidence concerning the emission line luminosity in the suggested blazar sequence .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that despite the differences in the continuum shapes of different sub  classes of blazars , a unitary scheme is possible , whereby blazar continua can be described by a family of analytic curves with the source luminosity as the fundamental parameter .",
    "the `` scheme '' ( admittedly empirical ) determines both the frequency and luminosity of the peaks in the synchrotron and inverse compton power distributions ( and therefore also the @xmath0ray luminosity in the egret range ) starting from the radio luminosity only .",
    "the main suggested trend is that with increasing luminosity both the synchrotron peak and the inverse compton peak move to lower frequencies and that the latter becomes energetically more dominant .",
    "the scheme is testable , for instance it predicts that sources emitting strongly in the tev band have relatively low intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the `` spectral sequence '' finds a plausible interpretation in the framework of relativistic jet models radiating via the synchrotron and inverse compton processes if the physical parameters ( magnetic field and/or critical energy of the radiating electrons ) vary with luminosity or if photons outside the jet become increasingly important as seed photons for the inverse compton process in sources of larger luminosity .",
    "the latter alternative is supported at least qualitatively by the increasing dominance of emission lines in higher luminosity objects .    the proposed scenario , in which the intrinsic jet power regulates , in a continuous sequence , the observational properties from the weaker hbl , through lbl , to the most powerful fsrqs , also fits in very nicely with the unification of fr  i and fr  ii type radio galaxies as proposed by bicknell ( 1995 ) . after a long debate",
    "the prevailing view is that fr  i and fr  ii radio galaxies both contain relativistic jets which can be decelerated giving rise to the fr  i morphology depending on the kinetic power in the jet and the pressure of the ambient medium .",
    "the whole radio ",
    "loud agn population could be unified in a two parameter space one being the intrinsic jet power , the other the viewing angle .",
    "an interesting point for future discussion is whether a third parameter associated with the luminosity of an accretion disk is necessary or is already implicitly and uniquely linked to the jet power .",
