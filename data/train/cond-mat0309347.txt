    "it is now commonly accepted that the tendency toward phase separation is of fundamental importance for the physics of manganites and related compounds  @xcite .",
    "the self - trapping of charge carriers is the most widely discussed type of phase separation , first predicted in the seminal paper of nagaev  @xcite . in such phase - separated states , charge carriers",
    "are confined within small ferromagnetic metallic droplets ( magnetic polarons or ferrons ) located in an insulating antiferromagnetic matrix .",
    "it is usually assumed that the region of the perturbed spins around a ferron is rather narrow that is confirmed by numerical calculations for some models  @xcite . however , as first pointed out by de gennes @xcite , the distortion of the magnetic order around a magnetic defect ( e.g. a ferron ) may decay slowly with the distance .",
    "the possible existence of ferrons with such extended spin distortions was analyzed for one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnetic chain in refs .  .",
    "these calculations performed for an isolated impurity show that the characteristic length of the distorted spin surrounding can be much larger than the size of the trapping region .",
    "the problem arises what kind of ferrons should be expected at different values of the parameters of the system . to study this problem ,",
    "we consider in this paper 1d antiferromagnetic chain doped with non - magnetic donor impurities of finite density .",
    "we find that there are two possible magnetic structures : one characterized by extended spin distortions and another one with a narrow distorted region .",
    "for the relationship between parameters characteristic of manganites , the ground state for a regular distribution of impurities corresponds to the ferrons without extended spin distortions .",
    "the ferrons with extended spin distortions can appear as excited metastable states .",
    "we found that due to the overlapping of extended spin distortions , an attractive interaction among these ferrons arises in the system .",
    "this interaction could favor a phase - separation process , that would lead the system to an inhomogeneous state with clusters of ferrons , as observed in the experiment .",
    "in this section , we find the magnetic structure of the ground state of an 1d antiferromagnetic chain doped by non - magnetic donor impurities .",
    "we consider an one - dimensional chain of antiferromagnetically coupled local spins , the @xmath0-axis being the axis of the chain .",
    "we do not considered here specific effects related to one - dimensionality and start from the antiferromagnetic structure characteristic of the mean - field approximation .",
    "non - magnetic impurities occupy the sites of the chain at half - integer positions .",
    "the conduction electrons are assumed to be in a bound state of the impurity electrostatic potential .",
    "it is also assumed , for simplicity , that the wave function of the conduction electron extends only over the two neighbouring magnetic ions near an impurity .",
    "further on , we assume that for a given density of conduction electrons @xmath1 , the impurities are periodically distributed along the chain , and @xmath2 being the distance between neighboring impurities ( in units of the lattice constant ) .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian of the system    @xmath3    where @xmath4 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) , @xmath5 is the spin of the magnetic ion located at site @xmath6 , treated as classical vector , symbols @xmath7 , @xmath8 denote the creation and annihilation operators for the conduction electron with spin @xmath9 at site @xmath6 , and @xmath10 are pauli matrices . the second and third terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) are the antiferromagnetic exchange between local spins and the magnetic anisotropy energy , respectively .",
    "the two terms in @xmath11 describe the kinetic energy of the conduction electrons bounded by the impurities , which are located between sites with @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is an integer ) , and the hund - rule coupling between the conduction electrons and the localized spins .",
    "parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 of hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1a ] ) are considered to be positive and the @xmath19 axis is the easy axis .",
    "the energy of coulomb interaction between the conduction electron and the impurity is an additive constant and , for this reason , omitted in the calculation .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1a ] ) is applicable for the description both of wide - band and double - exchange ( like manganites ) magnetic semiconductors .",
    "the hierarchy of parameters in wide - band case is @xmath20 while for the double - exchange case we have @xmath21 . in both cases @xmath18",
    "is assumed to be the smallest parameter , which corresponds in the most cases the experimental situation .",
    "it is well known that due to the hund - rule coupling @xmath15 hamiltonian ( [ eq:1b ] ) favors the deviations from the ideal antiferromagnetic arrangement of spins .",
    "the deviations are the most pronounced for the sites neighboring to impurities .",
    "this can be illustrated by the diagonalization of hamiltonian @xmath11 ( [ eq:1b ] ) , which can be easily performed . as a result",
    ", we have that the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath11 corresponding to the ground state and the low - lying excitations can be written as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the angle between vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we can see that the lowest value of energy @xmath26 corresponds to the parallel orientation of spins nearest to the impurity .",
    "so , we get a  seed \" ferron centered at the impurity .    to the first approximation",
    ", both wide - band and double - exchange cases can be treated in the same manner . at @xmath27 , the first - order term in @xmath26 with respect to @xmath28",
    "has the form    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the number of impurities . in the case",
    "@xmath31 , the similar expression can be obtained by interchanging @xmath32 .",
    "further on , we discuss the double exchange case ( [ eq:2b ] ) , however , the results for the wide - band case can be obtained by the aforementioned change of the parameters .",
    "let us consider now the configuration of the local spins corresponding to the ground state .",
    "due to the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1a ] ) with respect to the easy axis , all local spins in the ground state should lie in a plane containing the easy axis .",
    "the deviations of any local spin from this plane results in the growth of the energy of the system .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that it is the @xmath33 plane .",
    "the direction of a local spin @xmath34 in the @xmath33 plane can be characterized by angle @xmath35 with respect to @xmath36 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "then , the spins located between any two neighboring impurities can be represented as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 or 1 .",
    "the passing through a ferron changes such a sequence of spins to another one .",
    "since the impurities are periodically arranged along the chain , the magnetic ordering of local spins in the ground state has to be also periodic .",
    "there exist several ways to join the solutions at impurities , which preserve the periodicity .",
    "the corresponding relationships can be written as @xmath40 . however , only two of them give the energy gain and correspond to the ferron - type solutions .",
    "the first one is @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "this means that the magnetic moments of ferrons are directed along the @xmath36-axis . in the second case ,",
    "the magnetic moments of ferrons are directed along the easy axis , and spins close to the @xmath14th impurity satisfy the equality @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the configuration of local spins corresponding to the first case is @xmath45 for all @xmath6 , and the symmetry condition is @xmath46 .",
    "the configuration of local spins corresponding to the second case can be written in the form @xmath47 for @xmath48 , and the symmetry condition in this case is @xmath49 . both configurations",
    "are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .    in the 1d antiferromagnetic chain under",
    "study the magnetic moments of neighboring ferrons are either parallel or antiparallel for odd and even @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath50 is odd integer , the periodicity condition is @xmath51 , and the magnetic moments of all ferrons are parallel each other . for even @xmath50 ,",
    "the periodicity condition is @xmath52 and the magnetic moments of neighboring ferrons are antiparallel .",
    "taking into account the periodicity of the problem and the aforementioned symmetry conditions , we readily come to the relationships between the canting angles @xmath23 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:2b ] ) and the angles @xmath53 , @xmath54 . for any @xmath50",
    ", these relationships can be written in the following form : @xmath55 where plus ( minus ) sign corresponds to the first ( second ) configuration .",
    "now let us find the form of magnetic ordering for local spins and the energy of the system corresponding to each configuration . substituting the expressions for @xmath34 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu ] ) for canting angles @xmath56 , into the eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:2b ] ) , we obtain the energy of the system in the following form    @xmath57    where we use the notation @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 in the case @xmath27 , or @xmath61 for @xmath31 . the plus ( minus ) sign in eq .",

    "the constant term in ( [ eq:2b ] ) is omitted here .    to find the spin structure of the ground state",
    ", one has to minimize the energy ( [ eq:3 ] ) with respect to the angles @xmath62 .",
    "a set of nonlinear equations is obtained    @xmath63    using the periodicity conditions @xmath64 , @xmath65 for odd @xmath50 , or @xmath66 , @xmath67 for even @xmath50 , the number of equations in system ( [ eq:4 ] ) becomes equal to @xmath50 .",
    "after this , the system of equations is solved numerically at different values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 assuming that @xmath70 . as a result",
    ", we obtain the magnetic structure of the system of local spins with donor impurities .",
    "this structure is discussed in the next section .",
    "the numerical analysis of the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) demonstrates that two types of ferrons schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] can exist in the system under study .",
    "for relatively large @xmath71 the ground state corresponds to the ferrons of the second type ( see right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . for @xmath72",
    ", we have a classical ferron configuration  @xcite , namely , ideal ferromagnetic ordering inside the localization region of the doped electron ( two lattice constants in our case ) and ideal antiferromagnetism outside this region . the solution corresponding to the first configuration of the local spins ( see left panel in fig .  [ fig:1 ] )",
    "is characterized by a long - range deviation from the ideal antiferromagnetic ordering and can be considered as an excitation above the ground state .",
    "this spin structure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where we plot the directions of local spins between two impurities for @xmath73 .    for smaller @xmath68 ,",
    "the ground state of the system corresponds to the first type of ferrons .",
    "however , in this limit the difference between the two types of ferrons is not so drastic .",
    "both types of ferrons create a distortion of antiferromagnetic ordering outside the electron localization region . moreover , the characteristic size of the distorted region is larger for the ferrons of the second type . therefore , we come to the conclusion that for any value of the ratio @xmath68 the ground state of the system corresponds to the ferrons with smaller radius of spin distortions .",
    "let us consider in more detail the case @xmath74 ( typical of manganites ) .",
    "let us refer the ferrons with and without extended spin distortions as  coated \" and  bare \" , respectively .",
    "the system of  bare \" ferrons forms the ground state , whereas , the system of  coated \" ferrons can form a metastable state . in figs .  [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] , we show the energy of the  coated \" ferron and the angle of the local spin in the trapping region , @xmath75 as functions of the inverse impurity density , @xmath76 .",
    "the ferron energy @xmath77 is defined as the difference between energies of the system with and without doped electrons divided by the number of impurities , that is , @xmath78 .",
    "the energy of the  bare \" ferron does not depend on the density of impurities ( up to @xmath79 ) and equals to @xmath80 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , we plot the energy of the  coated \" ferron as a function of the canting angle @xmath81 at different impurity densities . at small densities",
    "the minimum of the ferron energy corresponds to nonzero value of @xmath81 , whereas at the densities exceeding some critical value @xmath82 the ferron energy has a minimum at @xmath83 .",
    "the numerical analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) shows that for impurity densities higher or equal than some critical density @xmath82 , the angle @xmath84 ( which is one - half of the canting angle @xmath81 ) for the  coated \" ferrons is equal to zero ( see fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , all spins in the chain become perpendicular to the easy axis . thus , at @xmath85 , the periodic structure of  coated \" ferrons becomes unstable . indeed ,",
    "such ferrons become structurally identical to  bare \" ferrons but have higher energy .",
    "any rotation of this spin structure toward the easy axis leads to the monotonic decrease of its energy .",
    "in other words , at small densities each  coated \" ferron creates a long - range spin distortion of the antiferromagnetic background around it .",
    "this long - range spin distortion stabilizes the  coated \" ferrons .",
    "the radius of extended spin distortion created by a single  coated \" ferron can be estimated as @xmath86 . when the density increases , the distortions created by neighboring ferrons start to overlap , the corresponding energy barrier lowers , and disappears at @xmath87 .    the critical density increases with @xmath88 since any deviation of the spins from the easy axis become less favorable with the growth of anisotropy energy",
    ". the value of @xmath87 decreases with the increase of ratio @xmath68 since the smaller canting angles become more favorable with the growth of the electron kinetic energy @xmath16 compared with the exchange integral @xmath17 .",
    "note that for small values of @xmath89 both types of ferrons remain stable up to the density @xmath90 .",
    "let us consider now the low density limit @xmath91 .",
    "as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] , the ferron energy and angle @xmath84 are practically density independent at @xmath92 . therefore ,",
    "in zero approximation , we can consider  coated \" ferrons as isolated objects .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that the difference between energies of  coated \" and  bare \" ferrons @xmath93 , weakly depends on the ratio @xmath68 .",
    "following ref .  , it can be shown in continuous approximation that @xmath94 , which is confirmed by computational results .",
    "since the ground state of the system corresponds to  bare \" ferrons , the ferrons with extended spin distortions can be considered as elementary excitations with the energy @xmath93 .",
    "note , that these excitations can appear only in pairs since a creation of a single  coated \" ferron strongly disturbs the ground state and costs the energy at least of the order of @xmath95 .",
    "it is easy to see that to create a pair of neighboring  coated \" ferrons , one needs to overcome the energy barrier of the order of @xmath96 ( because it is necessary to change the orientation of all spins between two ferrons with respect to easy axis ) .",
    "so , at low densities , this pair can be considered as a metastable state .",
    "the energy of a ferron in excited state @xmath93 is proportional to the square root of @xmath88 and , for the case @xmath97 , it can be rather small in comparison with @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , even at low temperatures @xmath98 , one can expect to have a relatively large number of ferrons in excited state .",
    "using conventional formulas for thermal averages and having in mind that  coated \" ferrons arise in pairs , we have for the averaged density @xmath99 of excited ferrons @xmath100 .",
    "this approach is valid only when the density of impurities is less than @xmath82 , otherwise the ferrons could not be considered as weakly interacting particles .",
    "however , within the order of magnitude the estimates for @xmath101 and @xmath93 are valid up to @xmath102 . then , at @xmath103 the excitations under discussion become unstable if the temperature exceeds a certain critical value @xmath104 . at @xmath105 the density of  coated \" ferrons exceeds @xmath82 .",
    "the  coated \" ferrons can be treated as isolated objects only in the limit of @xmath91 . at finite @xmath1 ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account the density dependence of the ferron energy .",
    "since the energy of the  coated \" ferrons decreases with the growth of their density , the interaction between them is attractive .",
    "this interaction arises due to the overlapping of the spin distortions of neighboring ferrons and its characteristic length far exceeds the lattice constant . although the calculation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] is valid only for a periodic distribution of the impurities , it is natural to expect that the similar attractive interaction should take place for random distribution of  coated \" ferrons .",
    "the detailed calculation of an attractive interaction between ferrons in a general case is the subject of further research .",
    "we just note here that this attractive interaction can be , in principle , the possible mechanism for formation of a long - range phase - separated state involving large clusters of ferrons .",
    "we studied the magnetic structure for 1d antiferromagnetic chain doped by homogeneously distributed non - magnetic donor impurities .",
    "the ground state of the system corresponds to a set of ferrons with characteristic size of the order of the localization length of electrons near the impurity .",
    "the elementary excitations in the system are ferrons with extended long - range spin distortions",
