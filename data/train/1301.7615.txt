    "classical cepheid variable stars are primary distance indicators because owing to the famous period - luminosity ( @xmath4-@xmath5 ) relationship they rank among standard candles in establishing the cosmic distance scale .",
    "companions to cepheids , however , complicate the situation .",
    "the contribution of the secondary star to the observed brightness has to be taken into account when involving any particular cepheid in the calibration of the @xmath4-@xmath5 relationship .",
    "binaries among cepheids are not rare at all : their frequency exceeds 50 per cent for the brightest cepheids , while among the fainter cepheids an observational selection effect encumbers revealing binarity @xcite .",
    "it is essential to study cepheids individually from the point of view of binarity before involving them in any calibration procedure ( of e.g. @xmath4-@xmath5 or period - radius relationship ) .",
    "this attitude is especially important if cepheid - related relationships are calibrated using a small sample .",
    "however , a deep observational analysis of individual cepheids can only be performed in the case of their galactic representatives .",
    "when dealing with extragalactic cepheids , unrevealed binarity is one of the factors that contribute to the dispersion of the @xmath4-@xmath5 relationship .",
    "a detailed list of physical factors responsible for the finite width of the @xmath4-@xmath5 relationship around the ridge line approximation is given by @xcite .",
    "the orbital period of binaries involving a supergiant cepheid component can not be shorter than about a year .",
    "spectroscopic binaries involving a cepheid component with orbital periods longer than a decade are also known ( see the on - line data base on binaries among galactic cepheids : http://www.konkoly.hu/cep/orbit.html ) .",
    "therefore , a first - epoch radial velocity curve , especially based on data obtained in a single observational season , is usually insufficient for pointing out an orbital effect superimposed on the radial velocity changes due to pulsation .    in the case of pulsating variables , like cepheids ,",
    "spectroscopic binarity ( sb ) manifests itself in a periodic variation of the @xmath6-velocity ( i.e. , the radial velocity of the mass centre of the cepheid ) . in practice , the orbital radial velocity variation of the cepheid component is superimposed on the radial velocity variations of pulsational origin .",
    "to separate the orbital and pulsational effects , knowledge of the accurate pulsation period is essential , especially when comparing radial velocity data obtained at widely differing epochs .",
    "therefore , the pulsation period and its variations have been determined with the method of the @xmath3 diagram @xcite for each target cepheid .",
    "use of the accurate pulsation period obtained from the photometric data is a guarantee for the correct phase matching of the ( usually less precise ) radial velocity data .    in this paper",
    "we point out spectroscopic binarity of six bright galactic cepheids by analysing radial velocity data .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the new observations and the equipments utilized are described in section  [ newdata ] .",
    "section  [ results ] are devoted to the results on the six new sb cepheids : gh  carinae , v419  centauri , v898  centauri , ad  puppis , ay  sagittarii , and st  velorum , respectively .",

    "we performed a radial velocity ( rv ) survey of cepheids with the 2.3  m anu telescope located at siding spring observatory , australia .",
    "the main aim of the project was to detect cepheids in binary systems by measuring changes in the mean values of their rv curve which can be interpreted as the orbital motion of the cepheid around the center of mass in a binary system ( change of @xmath6-velocity ) .",
    "the target list was compiled to include cepheids with single - epoch radial velocity phase curve or without any published radial velocity data .",
    "several cepheids suspected members in spectroscopic binaries were also put on the target list . on 64 nights between october 2004 and march 2006 we monitored 40 cepheids with pulsation periods between 2 and 30 days .",
    "( v898  cen was observed in july 2009 , too ) .",
    "medium - resolution spectra were taken with the double beam spectrograph using the 1200  mm@xmath1 gratings in both arms of the spectrograph .",
    "the projected slit width was 2@xmath7 on the sky , which was about the median seeing during our observations .",
    "the spectra covered the wavelength ranges 42005200    in the blue arm and 57006700    in the red arm .",
    "the dispersion was 0.55    px@xmath1 , leading to a nominal resolution of about 1   .",
    "all spectra were reduced with standard tasks in iraf .",
    "reduction consisted of bias and flat field corrections , aperture extraction , wavelength calibration , and continuum normalisation .",
    "we checked the consistency of wavelength calibrations via the constant positions of strong telluric features , which proved the stability of the system .",
    "radial velocities were determined only for the red arm data with the task _ fxcor _ , applying the cross - correlation method using a well - matching theoretical template spectrum from the extensive spectral library of @xcite .",
    "then , we made barycentric corrections to every single rv value .",
    "this method resulted in a 1 - 2  km  s@xmath1 uncertainty in the individual radial velocities , while further tests have shown that our absolute velocity frame was stable to within @xmath82 - 3  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this level of precision is sufficient to detect a number of cepheid companions , as they can often cause @xmath6-velocity changes well above 10  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "v898  centauri was observed on four consecutive nights in april , 2011 , using the _ feros _ ( fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ) instrument on the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope in la silla observatory , chile ( see table  [ tab - v898cen - feros - data ] ) .",
    "the _ feros _ has a total wavelength coverage of 356 - 920 nm with a resolving power of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "two fibres , with entrance aperture of 27 , simultaneously recorded star light and sky background .",
    "the detector is a back - illuminated ccd with 2948@xmath104096 pixels of 15@xmath11 m size .",
    "basic data reduction was performed using a pipeline package for reductions ( drs ) , in midas environment .",
    "the pipeline performs the subtraction of bias and scattered light in the ccd , orders extraction , flat - fielding and wavelength calibration with a thar calibration frame ( the calibration measurements were performed at the beginning of each night , using the thar lamp ) .    after the continuum normalization of the spectra using iraf we determined the radial velocities with the task _ fxcor _ , as in the case of the sso spectra ( see sect .",
    "[ sso ] ) .",
    "the velocities were determined in the region 500 - 600  nm where a number of metallic lines are present and hydrogen lines are lacking .",
    "we made barycentric corrections to each rv value with the task _ rvcorrect_. the estimated uncertainty of the radial velocities is 0.05  kms@xmath1 .",

    "the instrument s design is described in @xcite ; recent instrumental updates are found in @xcite .",
    "the spectra are reduced by the efficient online reduction pipeline that performs bias correction , cosmics removal , and flatfielding using tungsten lamps .",
    "thar lamps are used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "the reduction pipeline directly determines the rv through cross - correlation @xcite using a mask that resembles a g2 spectral type .",
    "the rv stability of the instrument is excellent and for non - pulsating stars the rv precision is limited by photon - noise , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the precision achieved for cepheids is lower due to line asymmetries .",

    "our finding confirms the previous statement by @xcite about the high percentage of binaries among classical cepheids and the observational selection effect hindering the discovery of new cases .",
    "radial velocity data obtained prior to ours were instrumental in discovering binarity of v419  cen , ad  pup , ay  sgr , and st  vel , while the spectroscopic binary nature of gh  car and v898  cen has been discovered from our observations alone .",
    "a companion star may have various effects on the photometric properties of the cepheid component .",
    "various pieces of evidence of duplicity based on the photometric criteria are discussed by @xcite and @xcite . as to our targets , there is no obvious sign of companion from photometry alone .",
    "this indicates that the companion star can not be much hotter than the cepheid component in either case .",
    "nevertheless , weak evidence of anomalous photometric behaviour was reported for gh  car by @xcite ( abnormal phase shift between the light curves in different photometric bands ) and for v419  cen by @xcite ( anomalous behaviour when determining its physical parameters with the cors method ) .",
    "the strange spectral type of f3iii for v898  cen appearing in the simbad data base may be wrong because an f9 spectral type has been deduced from our spectra .",
    "further spectroscopic observations are necessary to characterise these binary systems . in addition",
    ", accurate future photometric observations can be instrumental in confirming the interpretation of the wavy pattern superimposed on the parabolic @xmath3 graph of ad  pup in terms of a light - time effect .",
    "regular monitoring of the radial velocities of a large number of cepheids will be instrumental in finding more long - period spectroscopic binaries among cepheids .",
    "quite recently @xcite reported on their on - going survey for pointing out binarity of cepheids from the existing rv data covering sufficiently long time interval .",
    "radial velocity data to be obtained with the gaia astrometric space probe ( expected launch : october 2013 ) will certainly result in revealing new spectroscopic binaries among cepheids brighter than 13 - 14th magnitude @xcite .    when determining the physical properties ( luminosity , temperature , radius , etc . ) of individual cepheids , the effects of the companion on the observed parameters ( apparent brightness , colour indices , etc . )",
    "have to be corrected for .",
    "this type of analysis , however , should be preceded by revealing the binarity of the given cepheid .",
