    "a central theme of contemporary atomic physics experiment is the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates and other correlated atomic gases .",

    "i.e. _ , spinor condensates .",
    "spin - one and spin - two spinor condensates have been realized as particular hyperfine states of alkali atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition the trapping and cooling of @xmath2cr atoms has led to the realization of a spin - three condensate @xcite . on the theoretical front , since the initial work of ohmi and machida @xcite and ho @xcite numerous interesting works have followed that discuss ground states , dynamics , and topological excitations of such systems ( see , for instance , a review in [ ] ) .",
    "recently , it was shown within mean - field theory that the ground states of spinor condensates exhibit a high degree of symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is opaque in the standard spinor description of the condensate . on the other hand ,",
    "the symmetry is transparent in the so - called reciprocal state representation . here",
    ", one uses the fact that the mean field ground state of a spin-@xmath0 condensate can be described by @xmath1 coherent spin states orthogonal to it .",
    "each one of these so - called reciprocal states is fully spin - polarized , pointing along some direction on the unit sphere .",
    "since there are @xmath1 such reciprocal states , the ground state is uniquely described ( up to an overall phase ) in terms of the @xmath1 points on the unit sphere @xcite . for typical spinor",
    "condensate hamiltonians , these points , which we denote `` spin nodes '' , form highly symmetric configurations .",
    "for instance , an @xmath3 condensate has a cyclic phase , where the spin nodes are arranged in a tetrahedron , as well as a square phase .",
    "the spin - node description of the ground states of spinor condensates provides an intuitive geometrical description of the state of the condensate .",
    "in addition , it provides a parametrization which readily exhibits the hidden point - group symmetries of the state . despite its appeal",
    ", however , this parametrization has not been used to describe the dynamics of spinor condensates .",
    "our goal in this paper is to provide a complete description of the hydrodynamics of spinor condensates in terms of such spin - nodes .",
    "the description of the dynamics we provide in this paper is hydrodynamic in the sense that it focuses on the low energy dynamics of the system associated with locally conserved quantities , or with the slow elastic deformation of spontaneously broken degrees of freedom .",
    "as with any fluid , such a macroscopic hydrodynamic description is highly illuminating and useful .",
    "here we derive such a description using the density , superfluid velocity , and the spin - nodes ( the @xmath1 vectors on the unit sphere ) as our basic degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition to the euler equations , which describe mass , momentum , and energy conservation , we obtain @xmath1 landau - lifshitz equations for the dynamics of the spin - nodes .",
    "furthermore , our derivation gives a natural generalization of the mermin - ho relation which connects the vorticity in a ferromagnetic spinor condensate with the pontryagin index of the order parameter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : background ] provides general background on spinor condensates , and reviews recent progress on the hydrodynamic description of ferromagnetic condensates @xcite . in sec .  [",
    "sec : spinrep ] we present the spin node representation of spinor - condensate degrees of freedom , and derive several useful identities within this formalism . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fhalf ] we proceed to obtain hydrodynamic equations for the spin - half condensate , using the spin - node formalism , and find an analytic solution for a skyrmion configuration . in secs .",
    "[ sec : fone ] and [ sec : genf ] , we derive the general hydrodynamic equations of motion for the spin - one condensate , and then for an arbitrary spin-@xmath0 condensate , which includes a generalization of the mermin - ho relation @xcite .    the treatment of the spin degrees of freedom in this paper is exact , and it accounts for the full geometrical structure of the hydrodynamics of spinor condensates .",
    "but the precision of the hydrodynamic description here comes at a price : this formalism becomes increasingly complex as the spin @xmath0 grows , and , for large @xmath0 , the analysis of its exact form becomes impractical .",
    "nevertheless , the equations derived here even for large @xmath0 become quite useful in their linearized form . in an accompanying paper @xcite",
    ", we show how approximate methods  such as linearizing the equations of motion about mean - field solutions  elucidate the low energy properties of spinor condensates with arbitrary spin in a powerful and elegant way .",
    "for a single component bec , it is natural to expect a simple hydrodynamic description in terms of density and flow velocity .",
    "we take the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) as our starting point : i_t = - ^2 + g where @xmath4 is the macroscopic wave function , and @xmath5 is the density ( here and after for notational simplicity we will use scaled units ) .",
    "this equation can be recast into a the form of local momentum and mass conservation laws ; with the superfluid velocity @xmath6 , one obtains @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the material derivative .",
    "the first of these is the mass continuity equation , while the second is the euler equation for a fluid , where a quantum pressure term appears .      in a series of recent experiments , the quench dynamics of a ferromagnetic spin - one condensate",

    "such hydrodynamic equations were also derived in @xcite to describe magnetic properties of quantum hall systems .",
    "making use of this simple description , lamacraft showed that the helical configuration of the ferromagnetic condensate @xcite is unstable .",
    "in general , it is clear that such a geometric description simplifies , at least conceptually , the analysis of spinor - condensate dynamics .",

    "quite generally , a spin-@xmath0 spinor condensate may exhibit several flavors of paramagnetic rather than ferromagnetic behavior in its ground state .",

    "the expectation value of the magnetization for such a state is clearly zero along any direction , @xmath39 .",

    "in addition to its geometrical transparency , such a description also reveals the highly symmetric nature of the mean - field ground states .",
    "all the paramagnetic phases found so far correspond to a spin node configuration which is invariant under point symmetry group operations , and sometimes under a larger symmetry .",
    "the nematic phase of the @xmath33 condensate , for instance , is described by two antipodal spin nodes .",
    "@xmath3 condensates can exhibit a nematic phase as well , but also a phase in which the spin - nodes are the vertices of a square , and a phase with the spin nodes at the vertices of a tetrahedron .",

    "the reciprocal - spinor description was so far only utilized to discuss equilibrium properties of spinor condensates . the remarkable geometrical properties and hidden symmetries of the mean - field ground state ,",

    "this causes the superfluid density to be depleted in a small region of order of the coherence length around the core .",
    "this can be energetically costly if the condensate is near the incompressible regime .",
    "on the other hand , this situation can be circumvented for a spinor condensate .",
    "consider for example , a two component ( spin - half ) condensate @xmath166 , and take the @xmath167 component to have a @xmath121 vortex .",
    "then around the vortex core , the density of @xmath168 can be transferred to the vortex - free @xmath169 keeping the total density across the vortex core finite .",
    "this is known as the skyrmion configuration which has been argued to be the relevant topological defect for ferromagnetic condensates @xcite .",
    "let us now derive the analytic time - independent solution of the equations of motion in the incompressible regime having the skyrmion texture shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : nskyr ] ) constitute an analytic stationary solution to the equations of motion for the skyrmion configuration .",
    "now we move on to considering the more complicated case of the spin - one condensate .",
    "the spin - one spinor can be broken down into its two spin - half components and be written as @xmath184 where @xmath185 , where we again make use of the large - spin notation defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinor ] ) . the normalization factor for this case",
    "is found to be @xmath186    it is also instructive to calculate the spin operator s expectation value .",
    "to start we can expand into products of spin - half expectation values @xmath187 then using the identity in eq .",
    "( [ id1 ] ) , and the fact that in the factored expression , @xmath81 is only acting on spin - half states , we obtain @xmath188 dividing this by the normalization , we get the spin - one expectation value of the magnetization : @xmath189    by similar techniques , the vector potential for the spin - one case , with some work , can be written as @xmath190 one sees that the first two terms in this expression are the vector potentials from the individual spin - half components while the final term , which is gauge invariant , describes their coupling .",
    "this expression was previously obtained in refs . @xcite and @xcite , where a geometrical relation for the berry phase of a spin - one spinor was given .",
    "the field tensor corresponding to this vector potential can also be similarly computed .",
    "the most simplified form we find is @xmath191 this is a generalization of the mermin - ho relation to the spin - one case . to our knowledge",
    "such an expression has not been previously derived .",
    "while its geometrical interpretation is not as immediate as the spin - half case ( which is the pontryagin density ) , this expression might be of use in computing topological invariant quantities for spin - one fields .",
    "this formula has a simplified form when locally restricted to mean - field ground states .",
    "for instance for the ferromagnetic sate ( @xmath192 ) the above expression reduces to @xmath193 it is also useful to note that for the nematic state ( @xmath194 ) the field tensor identically vanishes , @xmath195 .",
    "finally , the gauge invariant quantity @xmath118 can be worked out to be @xmath196 this is an explicit representation of the cp@xmath197 model which can be viewed as a generalization of the nonlinear sigma model . here ,",
    "too , it is instructive to consider what this expression reduces to when locally restricting to mean - field ground states . for the ferromagnetic state",
    ", one finds @xmath198 on the other hand , for the nematic state @xmath118 reduces to @xmath199      we now proceed to do a similar analysis for the spin one problem . for this",
    "we note that the spin one gp energy functional has the form @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the expectation value of the spin - one operator . the first two hydrodynamic equations  the mass continuity equation and the modified euler equation  are obtained , as before , by contracting the gross pitaevskii equation with @xmath139 .",
    "the analysis proceeds along similar lines as the spin half case .",
    "however , for this case we need the generalization of the mermin - ho relation for spin one given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhs1 ] ) to give the field tensor and thus the effective electric and magnetic fields , in addition to the spin one expressions for @xmath118 eq .  ( [ eq : upsilons1 ] ) and the magnetization @xmath201 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms1 ] ) . with these quantities ,",
    "the first two equations of motion are @xmath202 and @xmath203    next , let us discuss the spin dynamical equations .",
    "these are obtained by contracting the gpe with @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "as before , this causes several terms to vanish since these spinors are orthogonal to @xmath46 .",
    "contracting with @xmath204 gives the following equation which gives the time derivative of the first node @xmath206 a similar equation for the time derivative of @xmath207 is obtained by contracting with @xmath205 . in the above , we have collected the following terms into the @xmath208 parameter @xmath209 finally , separating the real and imaginary parts as @xmath210 , we obtain the landau - lifshitz equations @xmath211 @xmath212 this provides a complete set of equations describing the dynamics of the spin - one condensate .",
    "now that we have considered the hydrodynamic equations for spin - half and spin - one condensates in detail , in the following we will consider the general case .",
    "the first two equations of motion , the mass continuity equation and the euler equation are found , as before , to be @xmath202 and @xmath213 the effective electric and magnetic fields again follow from the field tensor @xmath214 constructed from @xmath215 . for a general spin , however , such quantities are cumbersome to express directly in terms of the spin nodes , and we will refrain from doing so .    to obtain the landau - lifshitz equations , we contract the gpe with @xmath216 .",
    "doing this gives @xmath217 in this expression , we have used the notation for interaction energy introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinintalt ] ) .",
    "in addition we have introduced the quantities @xmath218 , @xmath219    instead of writing eq .",
    "[ eq : llgen ] in terms of vectors as in the previous sections , we will stop at this point .",
    "this equation provides a natural starting point in the analysis of the linearized equations of motion which will be developed in the companion paper ref .",
    "one of the most striking and surprising features of spinor condensates is the hidden symmetry of their mean field ground states . in this work ,",
    "we have strived to bring this symmetry to the forefront , and describe hydrodynamics of these condensates using the objects that exhibit the hidden symmetry , namely , the spin - nodes , and reciprocal coherent states .    in this work , we derived the hydrodynamic equations of motion for condensates of general spin , demonstrated their use in the computation of the skyrmion configuration of a ferromagnetic spin - half gas , and generalized the mermin - ho relation to spin - one condensates .",
    "a hydrodynamic description tries to capture the low - energy behavior of a continuous medium in terms if conserved and other simple quantities .",
    "therefore , it comes particularly handy when we consider spinor - condensates close to their mean - field ground state . in a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we will concentrate on small oscillations of the spinor condensate in the vicinity of the mean field - ground state . as we will show",
    ", it is there that the hidden point - group symmetry becomes most apparent and accessible . using the spin - node formalism , and the parametrization of the spin - nodes in terms of a stereographic projection",
    ", we will reduce the problem of finding the @xmath1 spin - wave eigenmodes to a simple question of decomposing a representation of the appropriate point symmetry group to its irreducible representations .",
    "we will also provide a simple recipe that allows the direct extraction of the condensate s spin - wave eigenmodes using the derivatives of the spherical harmonics , coupled with the knowledge of atomic orbital degeneracy lifting under a crystal field .",
