    "in the current paradigm of structure formation in the universe ( white & rees 1978 ) , galaxies are built from the merging of smaller units , leading to a universal distribution of sub - halos , where smaller haloes are embedded within larger haloes on all scales . while this paradigm successfully recovers the observed large - scale distribution of galaxies ( geller & huchra 1989 ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) using numerical simulations with increasing fidelity ( davis et al . 1985 ; springel et al .",
    "2006 ) , it is not yet clear whether it applies equally well to sub - galactic scales . the so - called missing satellites problem , i.e. , the over - abundance of dark - matter dominated dwarf galaxies in theoretical simulations of the milky way relative to observations of local group dwarfs ( klypin et al . 1999 ; kravtsov et al .",
    "2004 ; diemand et al .",
    "2008 ) raises questions about the applicability of the prevailing cold dark matter model on sub - galactic scales .",
    "our characterization of dwarf galaxies makes use of the wealth of information that is imprinted within every galactic gas disk ",
    "coded by the perturbations excited by passing satellites .",
    "the outer gas disks of galaxies are particularly useful tracers of recent tidal interactions .",
    "firstly , the gas being cold , is more responsive to perturbations than the stars .",
    "secondly , disturbances in the gas disk dissipate on the order of a dynamical time  leaving a clean slate , and therefore allow an easier interpretation of satellite interactions than the stellar disk , where past interactions are still visible after a dynamical time .",
    "this combination of a responsive but forgetful character makes outer gas disks a powerful probe of the visible gravitational effects of dim dwarf galaxies . in prior papers ( chakrabarti & blitz 2009 , henceforth cb09 ; chakrabarti & blitz 2011 ) , we analyzed observed disturbances on the outskirts of the gas disk of the milky way ( levine , blitz & heiles 2006 ) .",
    "starting with the hypothesis that the observed disturbances arise from the gravitational pull of a satellite , we developed a method to quantitatively characterize galactic satellites from their tidal imprints on gas disks . here",
    ", we provide the proof of principle of the method by applying it to galaxies with @xmath1 tidally interacting optical companions .",
    "our work in this series of papers is motivated by the question  can dark ( or nearly dark ) galactic satellites be characterized from their tidal gravitational imprints on the outer gas disks of galaxies ?",
    "this question and our method have far - reaching implications in many areas of astrophysics .",
    "our method is complementary to gravitational lensing in probing mass distributions without requiring knowledge of their stellar light , although it is not subject to uncertainties in the projected mass distribution ( vegetti et al .",
    "2010 ) , as is lensing .",
    "it provides a means of indirect detection of dark matter dominated objects , and may be correlated with gamma ray studies ( strigari et al .",
    "2008 ; hooper et al . 2008 ) to hunt for dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , our tidal analysis method ( henceforth ta ) , unlike indirect methods of dark matter detection like gamma ray studies , does not make any assumptions about the @xmath2 of the dark matter particle .",
    "ta also offers a potential route to address the missing satellites problem , and therefore may allow us to investigate whether the prevailing cold dark matter model applies equally well to sub - galactic scales . finally , recent observations of disturbances in the outskirts of spiral galaxies ( levine , blitz & heiles 2006 ; thilker et al . 2007 ; bigiel et al .",
    "2010 ) prompt the question whether these disturbances arise from passing galactic companions , and trigger the observed star formation in the very outskirts .",
    "it is worth noting that while there has been considerable progress in performing global hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ; governato et al .",
    "2009 among other papers ) in many respects , ( notably in resolving the structure of galaxies on scales larger than giant molecular clouds and following the dynamical evolution of the gaseous component with a more realistic treatment of cooling and dissipation ) , the treatment of star formation and feedback in global simulations is done today with ( increasingly complex ) sub - grid prescriptions .",
    "the outer gas disks of galaxies present an opportunity to study a relatively simple gas dynamics problem that can be suitably addressed by current simulation technology .",
    "the outskirts are not as prone to star formation and feedback as the inner regions of galaxies are . in a separate paper ( chang & chakrabarti 2011 )",
    ", we show that the dynamics of outer gas disks nearly reduces to a test - particle calculation , and present scaling relations that allow us to infer the satellite mass from the fourier amplitudes of the hi surface density map . to use particle physics phraseology ",
    "the extended hi disks of galaxies ( that extend to many times the optical radius ) are the largest `` detectors '' we have available to study the gravitational signatures of dark matter dominated galaxies .    in this paper , we apply ta to analyze observed disturbances in the outer gas disks of galaxies with known optical companions to present the proof of principle of the method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we review the simulation setup . in  3.1 , we present the method and details of the analysis and apply it to characterize m51 s satellite , and in  3.2 , we apply it to ngc 1512 s satellite .",
    "we discuss the level of uncertainty in the determination of the mass of the satellite , pericenter distance , and azimuth when using ta .",
    "we discuss caveats and future work in  4 and conclude in  5 .",

    "the halo of the primary is initialized with a hernquist ( hernquist 1990 ) profile that is associated with a corresponding nfw halo with the same dark matter mass within @xmath7 , where the density is 200 times the critical density .",
    "initial conditions similar to these were used by springel et al .",

    "we follow the same setup here , with the primary difference being the addition of a flat extended hi disk .    for the m51 simulation ,",
    "we choose an effective concentration ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scale length of the nfw halo ) of @xmath10 , and a dimensionless spin parameter @xmath11 ( implemented by imparting an uniform rotation to the halo ) ; the choice of these parameters are motivated by cosmological simulations ( e.g. bullock et al .",
    "the spin axis of the disk is aligned with that of the halo , and the disk scale length is set by relating it to the angular momentum of the disk .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the dimensional angular momenta of the disk and halo respectively ( with the latter being proportional to the spin parameter ) , and @xmath15 is the dimensionless mass fraction of the disk .",
    "we take the disk mass fraction to be 4.6% of the total mass .",
    "we choose a circular velocity @xmath16 , which is consistent with the cited number of 219 km / s for the maximum circular velocity of m51 noted in leroy et al .",
    "the primary galaxy is by construction designed to be similar to the whirlpool galaxy , and we adopt parameters similar to those reported in the comprehensive observational study by leroy et al .",
    "thus , we include an exponential disk of stars and gas , with a flat extended hi disk , as found in surveys of spirals ( bigiel et al .",
    "the disk scale length is set by relating it to the angular momentum of the disk ; the procedure is described in detail in springel et al .",

    "the mass fraction of the extended hi disk relative to the total gas mass is equal to 0.52 , and its scale length is twenty times that of the exponential disk of gas and stars .",
    "initial conditions similar to these were used in our earlier studies as well ( chakrabarti & blitz 2009 ; chakrabarti & blitz 2011 ) , with the parameters ( circular velocity of the halo , gas fraction , etc . ) chosen in an observationally motivated manner whenever possible .",
    "the companion of m51 is placed on an initially parabolic orbit , i.e. , the potential energy is equal to the negative of the kinetic energy at its starting point ( that due to energy loss at pericentric approach becomes a bound orbit ) starting at @xmath20 .",
    "the initial conditions for the companion galaxy are prescribed in the same way as the primary galaxy ; the concentration of the companion is scaled to its mass using the concentration - mass relations given in maccio et al .",
    "cosmological simulations do not find a significant trend of the spin parameter varying with mass ( maccio et al .",
    "2008 ) , and we therefore adopt a spin parameter @xmath11 for all the simulations . we adopt a gas fraction of 10% for m51 s companion .",
    "we scale the number of particles in the companion to its mass ratio , i.e. , a 1:3 mass ratio companion would be modeled with one - third as many particles as the primary galaxy .",
    "the pericenter distances cited in tables 1 and 2 refer to the minimum relative distance between the center of mass of the primary galaxy and satellite during the duration of the simulation .",
    "the parameter space survey and simulations for m51 are given in table 1 .",
    "eqs refers to the equation of state , with 0 referring to isothermal and 0.25 to the fiducial choice of energy injection from supernovae as in the springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) model .",
    "the `` h '' inclination refers to a co - planar orbit and the `` e '' inclination refers to an inclined orbit , with the same nomenclature as in cox et al .",
    "the simulations are labeled by the mass of the satellite and pericenter approach distance , i.e. , a 3r15 refers to the interaction of a 1:3 mass ratio satellite with a pericenter approach distance of @xmath21 , with additional parameters ( like the equation of state , orbital inclination or velocity or bulge fraction ) denoted as part of the simulation name .",
    "our parameter survey here primarily explores the dependence of the mass and pericenter distance , as we have previously found these two parameters to drive the fit to the data ( cb09 ; cb11 ) , with cc11 confirming cb09 s early result that orbital inclination does not significantly affect the location of a simulation on the @xmath22 plane .",
    "we additionally explore here whether the orbital velocity of the satellite and bulge fraction of the primary galaxy can affect our results .",
    "as in prior work , we again include cases where we vary orbital inclination and equation of state of the gas . while this is not an exhaustive parameter survey ( which would be restrictive due to the multidimensional nature of the simulations ) , we are able to address whether the detailed trajectory of the satellite may influence our results ( by varying the orbital inclination and orbital velocity ) , as well as whether properties of the primary galaxy may influence our results ( by varying the bulge fraction and equation of state of the gas ) . in earlier work , we had found that modest variations in gas fraction do not affect our results ( when the gas fraction is varied within the range of local spirals ) ( cb09 ) .    for the simulation of ngc 1512 interacting with ngc 1510 ,",

    "our focus here will be on what we can learn from analysis of the extended hi arm in the outskirts of m51 .",
    "much work has been done on modeling the dynamical interaction between m51 and its companion .",
    "most of this work has been focused on the response of the stellar disk ( toomre 1980 ; hernquist 1990 ) excited by m51 s companion , while recent hydrodynamical simulations ( dobbs et al .",

    "the quantity @xmath37^{2}| $ ] is the residual of the @xmath38 mode only .",
    "the best - fit time snapshot is that which minimizes @xmath39 and @xmath40 for a given simulation .",
    "the entire simulation set is searched accordingly .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 for the data is determined with respect to the photometric center ( walter et al . 2008 ) . for the simulations , @xmath41 is determined with respect to the bulge center of mass if a bulge is present , and with respect to the baryonic center of mass if a bulge is not included .",
    "it is clear from inspection of figures [ f : m51data ] and [ f : m51sim ] that it is at the best - fit time that the simulation produces the optimal visual match to the data image of m51 as well .",
    "the best - fit simulation has a perturber mass ratio of @xmath42 and a pericentric approach distance of 15 kpc .",
    "the mass estimate agrees closely with observation estimates for the mass of m51 s companion , and with recent hydrodynamical studies of m51 ( dobbs et al . 2010 ; salo & laurikainen 2000 ; smith et al .",
    "furthermore , at the best - fit time , the perturber in the simulation is at a distance that is 1.5 times as large as the extent of the stellar spiral arms of m51 , which is within a factor of @xmath43 of the observed ratio .",
    "this ratio of distances ( the location of the perturber relative to the extent of the stellar spiral arms ) , which is similar to an aspect ratio , is not affected by projection effects .",
    "projection effects introduce an ambiguity into a purely radial distance , and the true deprojected distance to m51 s companion is not known . as shown in figure [",
    "f : m51data ] , m51 s companion lies at the short arm , and this is also the case at @xmath44 , at which time we achieve the best - fit to the fourier amplitudes .",
    "we discuss later that while the range of azimuth as determined from the phase of the @xmath38 mode varies by @xmath45 degrees due to the variation of initial conditions and orbits , the azimuth in all cases is in the right quadrant .",
    "it is important to note that our method will work best for galaxies that are seen close to face on , which is the case for both m51 and ngc 1512 .",
    "this is of course not true in general , and is a limitation of our method at present .",
    "the fourier amplitudes constrain both the mass and pericenter distance of the satellite .",
    "this may seem surprising as the tidal force is proportional to @xmath46 ( i.e. , it is the first term in the approximation for the tidal force when the pericenter distance is large relative to the galaxy size ) and one might expect a degeneracy between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however , as first shown by cb09 , one can break this degeneracy when one is not in the impulse approximation .",
    "the impulse approximation assumes that the primary galaxy does not respond along the course of the orbit of the perturber .",
    "we showed earlier ( figure 3 in cb09 ) that in reality , the nonlinear response of the gas in the primary galaxy along the course of the orbit of the perturber allows one to break this degeneracy , and determine @xmath49 and @xmath50 independently , from the fourier amplitudes .",
    "we also showed that the resultant fourier amplitudes are not significantly affected by the initial conditions of the simulated primary galaxy , such as the gas fraction ( provided the gas fraction is varied to within the range of typical spirals ) , equation of state , and the inclination of the orbit ( cb09 , chang & chakrabarti 2011 ) .",
    ".[fig : m51fourieramps],title=\"fig : \" ] .[fig : m51fourieramps],title=\"fig : \" ]    shown in figure [ fig : m51fourieramps ] ( a ) and figure [ fig : m51fourieramps ] ( b ) are the local fourier amplitudes of the data and best - fit simulation ( at the best - fit time ) respectively .",
    "the fourier amplitudes are shown here normalized to the axisymmetric ( @xmath51 ) mode .",
    "the best - fit simulation ( and best - fit time ) is determined by minimizing the difference between the variances of the fourier modes of the data and the simulations .",
    "although there is an overall level of agreement between the amplitudes of the simulations and the data , we are not seeking here to match the detailed features due to the possibility of missing diffuse emission in the interferometric hi maps .",
    "in other words , while there is general agreement for the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( which are @xmath52 over radius ) , there are differences at particular radii between the simulation and data fourier amplitudes .",
    "what we find is that a perfect fit to the fourier amplitudes is not necessary ( and indeed we do not attempt to do this ) to infer the mass and pericenter distance to within a factor of two , which given the other dependencies in the problem and the lack of single dish data , is of sufficient accuracy for our purposes here .    the magnitude of the @xmath38 and @xmath53 mode in the outskirts ( @xmath54 ) in both the simulations and the data is @xmath55 .",
    "we focus our analysis here on the outskirts ( @xmath54 ) because these regions are beyond the outer lindblad resonance where we can more cleanly separate the effects of the perturber from the self - excited response .",
    "we estimate the pattern speed of the two - armed spiral of the primary galaxy when it is evolving in isolation using the tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) method . the outer lindblad resonance is then given by graphically finding the radial region where @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the epicyclic frequency , which gives @xmath58 .",
    "this is an approximate measure , as there are multiple spiral patterns that are time - dependent .",
    "we have checked that for @xmath59 , the fourier amplitudes of the primary galaxy evolving in isolation are much lower ( a few percent at most ) .",
    "thus , we are confident that in the outskirts , we are looking at the tidal response produced by the companion .",
    "furthermore , the outskirts are hi dominated and are thus less subject to the effects of feedback from supernovae and star formation which complicate the ism structure ( and the modeling thereof ) in the inner regions of galaxies .",
    "we note here that we are not seeking to identify a given model as particularly unique so to allow the inference of orbital parameters . as mentioned in related papers ( cb09 ; chakrabarti & blitz 2011 ; chang & chakrabarti 2011 ) , the degeneracy due to inclination , for a given @xmath60 pair , does not allow us to determine the orbital history .",
    "this , coupled with the ( weak ) dependence on initial conditions of the simulated primary galaxy means that we can not clearly determine which orbital inclination , for a given mass and pericentric approach , would most uniquely fit the data .",
    "what we aim to do here is to convey the general trends in how well different simulations fit the data via their location on the variance vs variance plot .",
    "relative to the data , and the y - axis is the variance of fourier modes @xmath61 .",
    "on such a variance vs variance plot , the best - fit simulations fall close to the origin .",
    "the simulations are labeled by the mass ratio of the satellite and pericentric approach distance , i.e. , 3r15 is a 1:3 mass ratio satellite with a pericentric approach distance of @xmath21 . [",
    "f : m51s1to4 ] ]    figure [ f : m51s1to4 ] displays the simulation parameter space surveyed , and also which simulations best fit the data for m51 . figure [ f : m51s1to4 ] is a variance vs variance plot of fourier mode @xmath38 relative to the data ( @xmath39 ) , plotted versus the variance of fourier modes @xmath61 added in quadrature ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "on such a variance vs variance plot ( which shows the difference of the fourier modes in a given simulation relative to the data at their respective best - fit times ) , the best fits will lie close to the origin .",
    "a given simulation is labeled by the mass ratio of the satellite and pericentric approach distance , i.e. , 3r15 is m51 interacting with a 1:3 mass ratio perturber with a pericentric approach distance of @xmath21 .",
    "table 1 lists the symbols used in figure [ f : m51s1to4 ] and the simulations they refer to .",
    "the `` e '' inclination refers to @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the angle of the primary galaxy relative to the orbital angular momentum plane of the system ( we adopt the same nomenclature here for the orbits as in ( cox et al .",
    "2006 ) and ( barnes 1988 ) ) .",
    "it is immediately clear from figure [ f : m51s1to4 ] that low mass perturbers ( with mass ratios less than @xmath64 ) can not fit the data .",
    "the quantity @xmath40 scales approximately as the square root of the mass ratio of the satellite for a fixed pericentric approach distance for low - mass companions , a result also found by chang & chakrabarti ( 2011 ) ( for a similarly defined sum of the fourier amplitudes ) .",
    "the best - fit to the fourier amplitudes of m51(where the best - fit is derived by minimizing the difference in local fourier amplitudes of the simulations and data between @xmath65 for all simulations as a function of time ) is accomplished with a 1:3 mass ratio satellite with a pericentric approach distance of @xmath21 .",
    "we find that a pericentric approach distance of @xmath21 for a 1:3 mass ratio satellite yields a better fit than a 3r7 simulation ( a 1:3 satellite with pericenter distance of @xmath66 ) .",
    "a 3r15 ( black cross , and black filled circle , where the black filled circle corresponds to an isothermal equation of state and the black cross to a multiphase ism ) yields a slightly better fit than a 4r15 ( red asterisk ) and a significantly better fit than a 2r15 ( green cross ) .",
    "3r15 is significantly favored over 3r7 ( points in blue ) or 3r25 ( orange asterisk ) . a 3r7 yields",
    "a better fit than a 4r7 ( red cross ) or a 5r7 ( yellow cross ) .",
    "the points in blue all correspond to the `` variants of 3r7 '' , where we have held the mass of the companion and pericenter distance constant but varied other parameters that may affect the fourier amplitudes including : orbital inclination , equation of state , bulge mass fraction , orbital velocity .",
    "we do this to understand whether the mass and pericenter distance are truly the dominant parameters that drive the location of a given simulation on the variance vs variance plot .",
    "while the parameter space study that we show here is not exhaustive , we try to delineate the important dependencies of the problem and those that are not as significant .",
    "we see that varying orbital inclination ( blue asterisk showing an inclined orbit ) , or changing the equation of state ( blue filled circle ) , or modest changes in the orbital velocity ( blue triangle - 3r7v+ , blue square - 3r7v- ) , or including a bulge in the simulation ( blue diamond ) , do not significantly affect the fourier amplitudes .",
    "we have shown here cases where we increased ( decreased ) the relative orbital velocity of the companion by 30% relative to the standard case , finding that a decrease in the relative orbital velocity ( 3r7v- ) with respect to our standard case is slightly favored , but not significantly so .",
    "we have earlier demonstrated in cb09 that varying gas fraction from @xmath67 does not significantly affect the fourier amplitudes . in chang & chakrabarti ( 2011 ) ,",
    "we presented an extensive study of the dependence of the fourier amplitudes on orbital inclination , so we only show a couple of cases here to make the point that the orbital inclination of the perturber does not greatly affect the fourier amplitudes .",
    "inspection of the cases where the perturber mass and pericentric distance are held constant , but initial conditions , orbital inclination , equation of state , and orbital velocity are varied , shows that these other parameters affect the fit to the data only slightly .",
    "this weak dependence on all parameters aside from the mass of the perturber and pericentric approach distance allows us to solve the inverse problem .",
    "however , the dependence on other parameters does make it difficult to determine the pericentric approach distance and satellite mass to better than a factor of two .    in summary ,",
    "the best - fit mass ratio for the satellite for m51 is a 1:3 satellite with a pericentric approach distance of @xmath21 .",
    "the uncertainly in the mass determination is a factor of two , i.e. , a 1:5 yields a significantly poorer fit , and a 1:2 is also a poorer fit relative to the 1:3 ; the pericenteric approach is similarly unconstrained at the factor of two level . for massive companions ( @xmath68 ) that approach close to the galactic disk ( i.e. , close to the regions where the galactic disk has an exponential profiile ) ,",
    "the problem is not scale - free , and the fourier amplitudes depend in a more complex way on the mass ratio than the square root dependence ( for fixed @xmath50 ) found by chang & chakrabarti ( 2011 ) . we do not attempt to obtain scaling relations for the fourier amplitudes for massive companions in this paper .",
    "it is nonetheless clear that we can constrain the satellite mass and distance of closest approach using the numerically calculated fourier amplitudes to a factor of two , providing a quantitative ( albeit approximate ) means to hunt for dark - matter dominated galaxies even when they may be optically dim .    to demonstrate the dependence of the fourier amplitudes on the inclusion of a bulge",
    ", we explicitly show a case ( depicted in the blue diamond ) where we have included a bulge ( with a bulge mass fraction of 0.012 and a scale length for the bulge of 0.2 relative to the disk scale length ) and calculated the fourier amplitudes from the bulge center of mass . as is clear",
    ", this simulation is not markedly different from the other simulations in @xmath39 or @xmath40 . in principle , an offset in the center of mass ( of the component with respect to which the center of mass is calculated ) can introduce or suppress power in the @xmath38 mode .",
    "however , when it is expressed as the @xmath69 quantity @xmath39 , we find little change with respect to center of mass variations of the gas and bulge components .",
    "moreover , while the local fourier amplitude of the @xmath38 mode can be affected by different choices of the center of mass , the sum of the modes remains nearly constant , as the sum is equivalent to distributing power between the various modes .",
    "blitz ( 1994 ) gives a detailed review of various choices of the center of mass of the milky way and concludes that all the mass concentrations near the galactic center appear to have non - zero radial velocities .",
    "thus , it is difficult to establish which is the correct choice",
    ". fortunately , this consideration , as well as the inclusion of a bulge in the model , does not seriously affect the placement of a simulation in the @xmath70 plane .",

    "the model s validity ( and indeed this method s ) is reinforced when these two metrics independently yield the same information .",
    "finally , we speculate on some generalizations of the model that we have considered here and the resultant possible effects .",
    "namely , we briefly discuss the effects of multiple passages and the effects of multiple perturbers . while cosmological dark - matter only simulations ( diemand et al .",
    "2008 ) find an abundance of sub - structure , the tidal effects of sub - structure on the galactic gaseous disk depend not only on the mass distribution , but also on the pericentric approach distance , as well as the distribution of such impacts as a function of time .",
    "the latter dependence is particularly crucial for gaseous disks  as disturbances in the gas disk damp out on the order of a dynamical time .",
    "this @xmath95 of the gaseous component allows us to more cleanly disentangle the effect of the very last perturber from the ones that impacted the disk previously , i.e. , if impacts occurred significantly in excess of a dynamical time , then the gas disk retains essentially no memory of that impact .",
    "simulations predict impacts with @xmath96 mass ratio perturbers occur only once every @xmath97 ( diemand et al . 2008 ) .",
    "secondly , it is clear that if there is a distribution in mass that is similar to what is found in cosmological simulations , then the most massive perturber will dominate the response . in the impulsive heating approximation , the tidal effects of a sub - halo population scale as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the number density and satellite mass ( white 2000 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that the mass function of sub - halos is given by a power - law @xmath101 , with @xmath102 ( gao et al .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the dynamical effects of cdm sub - structures will be dominated by the most massive sub - structures similar to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "finally , the tidal force depends sensitively on where the impact occurs .",
    "cosmological simulations find very few close encounters for satellites of mass ratio @xmath96 or greater ( kuhlen et al .",
    "thus , although the prevalence of sub - structure in these simulations may suggest the importance of multiple perturbers , closer inspection finds that the effect of multiple perturbers is likely to be minimal , although they may well contribute a low level of baseline noise that needs to be modeled to more properly interpret these disturbances .",
    "another point that is important to note is that the aforementioned simulations were performed without the inclusion of gas , and the inclusion of gas may well affect the abundance of sub - structure .",
    "we have not analyzed here the vertical structure of the disk and the production of warps , which is a significant caveat to our work .",
    "a model that may explain the production and persistence of warps is cosmological infall",
    "( roskar et al . 2010 ) .",
    "however , unless the warp is large , it is likely to primarily affect the vertical structure rather than the planar disturbances , which is what we focus on here . in earlier papers , where we studied the time evolution of the gaseous disks of milky way - like spiral galaxies perturbed by small passing companions",
    ", we did find that the vertical thickness of the disk has some angular dependence ( chakrabarti & blitz 2011 ) .",
    "the addition of the analysis of the vertical structure of the disk and assessment of its parameter - dependence would render our study here prohibitively expensive .",
    "motivated by the work of roskar et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and others that have modeled the formation and persistence of warps as due to cosmic infall , we study the production of warps in detail in a forthcoming paper by analyzing hydrodynamical cosmological simulations .",
    "another point that bears mention is the effect of multiple passages of the same perturber in a bound orbit .",
    "the effects of single versus multiple passages of m51 s companion have been explored by salo & laurikainen ( 2000 ) using simulations .",
    "they find that both types of interactions can approximate the morphology of m51 , with certain observational features better matched by requiring two approaches of m51 s companion , namely the peculiar velocities in the north of the companion .",
    "however , even the multiple - encounter model fails to reproduce the observed velocity field in the outer disc region . in terms of our findings here ,",
    "i.e. , the derivation of the mass and pericentric approach distance , they find a range less than a factor of two in satellite mass for multiple passage models , and less than 30 % in pericentric approach distances that would satisfy the observed morphology .",
    "it appears therefore that at present we can not distinguish between multiple passages if they occur sufficiently rapidly .",
    "fortunately , this effect does not significantly increase the range of allowed masses and pericentric approach distances .",
    "we leave the investigation of the velocity field , which may potentially resolve the degeneracy here between single and multiple passages , to a future study .    finally , while cosmological simulations ( maccio et al . 08 ) predict concentration - mass relations for dark matter halos that we have adopted here and in related papers ( cb09 , cb10 , cc2011 ) , in principle this is an unknown quantity .",
    "the potential depth of the dark matter halo will certainly affect tidal tails , as has been shown for the mass dependence ( dubinski et al .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we do not attempt here to achieve an exact match to the fourier amplitudes or the morphology of the tidal tails , as our adopted metric of comparison is an intrinsically global quantity ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that small variations in the concentrations of dark matter halos will not affect our results .",
    "we leave the detailed study of how the fourier amplitudes will be affected by variations in the concentration of dark matter halos to a future paper .",
    "in summary , we have applied the tidal analysis method to two representative galaxies with known optical companions that cover a large range in perturber to primary galaxy mass ratio ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we find that we accurately recover the mass of the companion , its azimuthal location , and its relative separation for both m51 and ngc 1512 .",
    "the uncertainty in the determination of the satellite mass and pericentric distance for both these systems is a factor of two , with a total spread of @xmath104 degrees in the determination of the azimuth .",
    "these simulations represent the most sophisticated calculations of the interactions of m51 and ngc 1512 and their companions to date .",
    "our results demonstrate the power of this method for quantitatively ( albeit approximately ) characterizing cold dark matter sub - structure from hi observations of spiral galaxies .",
    "this method can be calibrated with respect to other indirect methods of cdm sub - structure identification such as gravitational lensing , to ultimately provide a determination of the evolution of cdm sub - structure with redshift .",
    "in addition , it has the potential to allow us to understand the impact of galactic satellites in triggering star formation in the very outskirts of galactic disks . in the future",
