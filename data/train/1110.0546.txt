    "right after the 1986 discovery of high-@xmath1 superconductivity in the cuprate materials , anderson made a seminal proposal @xcite that the on - site coulomb repulsion plays a crucial role . at half - filling , with each unit cell in the copper - oxide plane occupied by one electron from the conduction band ,",
    "the cuprate is a mott insulator with a full gap opening up in the charge degree of freedom . due to the odd number of @xmath2 spin per unit cell ,",
    "the spin degrees of freedom remain unfrozen , in contrast to a band insulator , and the localized spins antiferromagnetically interact with each other via a residual nearest - neighbor heisenberg superexchange coupling @xmath3 , to the leading order of approximation .",
    "it was then conjectured @xcite that the novel superconductivity should arise by doping such a mott insulator .    a prototype superconducting ground state incorporating the mottness",
    "is known as the gutzwiller - projected bcs state @xcite@xmath4where @xmath5 denotes an ordinary bcs superconducting state and @xmath6 is a gutzwiller projection operator enforcing the following no double occupancy constraint    @xmath7    there are two essential components in this ground state ansatz .",
    "first , the cooper pairing in @xmath5 is originated from the superexchange coupling @xmath3 .",
    "second , the gutzwiller projection @xmath6 removes those doubly occupied configurations which would cost high energy due to the large on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "in particular , because of @xmath6 , the cooper pairing in @xmath5 reduces to the neutralized singlet pairs of spins at half - filling , known as the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state @xcite , which is a mott insulator with the charge degree of freedom totally frozen out .",
    "hence an essential observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the localized spins have a tendency to form real - space singlet pairing in order to gain the superexchange energy .",
    "hole doping ( with removing the localized spins ) can then lead to high-@xmath1 superconductivity as the charge neutral rvb pairs start to move to the empty sites and become partially charged cooper pairs .",
    "today , strongly motivated by this idea , searching for new mott insulators with an rvb ( spin liquid ) ground state has become an important goal in material syntheses , with the hope to find new exotic superconductors upon doping .",
    "however , the electron ground state in the half - filled cuprates has turned out to be not simply a spin liquid with short - range rvb pairing . as a matter of fact",
    ", it was quickly established experimentally @xcite that the localized spins are long - range antiferromagnetically ( afm ) ordered instead .",
    "theoretically the ground state of the afm heisenberg model in two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice is also an afm ordered state theory whose properties are well in accord with those found in the cuprates at half - filling .",
    "nevertheless the afm long - range order disappears quickly upon doping the holes into the cuprates .",
    "consequently only short - range afm correlations remain beyond some finite doping concentration , which may be still effectively described , as one would hope , by some kind of rvb or spin liquid state @xcite . since there is already a sufficient amount of holes present , it would then become superconducting as envisaged @xcite in the original rvb proposal .    in this context ,",
    "a spin liquid state relevant to the superconductivity , if present in the cuprates , should be by itself an _ emergent _ state , arising after the long - range afm order of an antiferromagnet gets destroyed by the motion of the doped holes . the real challenge to understanding the superconducting mechanism in the cuprates is therefore to correctly demonstrate how the antiferromagnet at half - filling can be doped into a short - range afm state , where the doping itself plays the central role of dynamic frustration effect .",
    "the resulting state can be either simultaneously superconducting or , more generally , a pseudogap phase  with the superconducting phase naturally embedded inside",
    ".    this will be the central theme illustrated in this article .",
    "i will present convincing theoretical rationale of why it is absolutely necessary to carefully deal with the non - perturbative and singular nature of doping an antiferromagnet in order to correctly understand the superconducting and pseudogap physics in the cuprates . the resulting superconducting ground state @xcite , although bears a close resemblance to eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) , is generally qualitatively different from the latter because , as it turns out , the spin and charge degrees of freedom are intrinsically entangled together by a hidden fundamental law underlying the mottness ( see sec .",
    "iii ) , which is not manifested in eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) .",
    "as emphasized in introduction , the superconducting ground state in a doped mott insulator will reduce to a mott insulator at half - filling .",
    "in particular , the localized spin state should correctly recover the afm long - range ordered ground state of the heisenberg model in this limit .",
    "below we illustrate how to realize such a construction in a straightforward way .    ) ) , bosonic spins form singlet pairs with an amplitude @xmath8 , which only connects two spin partners at opposite ( a and b ) sublattices as indicated by a blue - colored bond .",
    "the marshall sign rule @xcite is precisely satisfied at half - filling , where @xmath9 is real and positive , and the wavefunction is very accurate to describe the ground state of the heisenberg model with a long - range afm order in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . in the superconducting phase ,",
    "such a state will reduce to a ghost  spin liquid background with @xmath8 becoming short - ranged ( cf .",
    "[ wf ] ) . ]    at half - filling ,",
    "although there is no exact solution in 2d , the liang - docout - anderson ( lda ) type bosonic rvb state @xcite can give rise to the most accurate variational energy for the heisenberg model with the correct long - range afm order . it can be written in the form@xmath10 in the electron @xmath11-operator representation . by nature",
    "this is a _",
    "state with a bosonic wavefunction @xmath12 for each given spin configuration @xmath13 as shown in fig .",
    "[ b - rvb]@xmath14 here the rvb pairing amplitude @xmath15 connects two _ antiparallel _ spins denoted by @xmath16 ( up spin ) and @xmath17 ( down spin ) at two opposite sublattices of the square lattice , with the summation running over all possible pairing partitions for a given @xmath18 .",
    "the staggered sign @xmath19 ( the marshall sign ) is explicitly separated from @xmath8 such that the latter remains a smooth function of the distance between even and odd lattice sites .",
    "a real and positive @xmath8 obeying the power law at large spatial separation of @xmath20 has been shown to optimize @xcite the ground state energy , with @xmath21 satisfying the marshall sign rule @xcite .    to start with @xmath22 , which is much more precise than eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) at half - filling , a ground state ansatz for the doped case may be constructed as follows @xcite@xmath23namely , the doped holes can be introduced by annihilating @xmath24 electrons from the vacuum  state @xmath22 .",
    "apparently such a new state automatically satisfies the no double occupancy constraint without invoking the gutzwiller projection @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the holes are created in pairs with an amplitude @xmath25 to realize the cooper pairing , which is energetically favorable so long as the rvb pairing persists in @xmath22 at low doping @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ wf ] .    here both @xmath25 and @xmath8 can be determined variationally weng_11 based on the t - j model and the main results are as follows .",
    "while @xmath25 is associated with the singlet d - wave cooper pairing , @xmath8 is found to change from a long - range power - law behavior ( @xmath26 ) to an exponential behavior : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the spatial distance and @xmath29 is the characteristic pair size determined by the doping concentration @xmath30 : @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the lattice constant ) .",
    "this indicates that @xmath22 indeed evolves from a long - range afm state to a _ short - ranged _ spin liquid self - consistently at finite doping .    generally speaking",
    ", one can not smoothly connect the ground state @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) to the gutzwiller - projected bcs state @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) . at finite doping ,",
    "the former is distinct from the latter by an explicit separation of the neutral spin rvb pairing and cooper pairing .",
    "thus , in contrast to the one - component  rvb state @xmath34 without explicitly distinguishing the cooper and rvb pairings , the construction in eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) may be regarded as a two - component  rvb structure .",
    "such a ground state can accurately describe the afm correlations , via a bosonic state @xmath35 at half - filling , while it can account for the right charge degree of freedom at finite doping without an additional projection procedure .",
    "the key in driving an afm state into a spin liquid involves an important doping effect through @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) . generally the phase shift factor @xmath36 emerges because the bosonic rvb pairing in @xmath22 and the cooper pairing of the electrons are not statistically compatible and each doped hole will create a nonlocal phase shift in the spin background . here @xmath36 will represent the most important and singular property of the mottness as to be elaborated below .",
    "the purely bosonic lda wavefunction , eq .",
    "( [ rvb ] ) , can be regarded as an important consequence of the mott physics .",
    "namely the electrons are fully bosonized in the restricted hilbert space at half - filling . in the opposite",
    "dilute electron limit , the fermi statistics of the electrons should get recovered",
    ". then the statistical sign structure of wavefunctions for a doped mott insulator is expected to be generally changed when holes are doped into the system @xcite .    explicitly identifying this effect",
    "turns out to be crucial in determining the phase shift factor @xmath36 in the wavefunction construction ( gs ) , which may be generally expressed by @xmath37where the phase shifts @xmath38 are associated with the holes , with @xmath39 denoting the hole occupation number at site @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is a bosonic wavefunction symmetric with regard to the hole coordinates @xmath42 , which is present to ensure gauge invariance of the phase shift fields .",
    "let us first introduce an exact theorem for the t - j model , known as the phase string effect @xcite , which holds for a bipartite lattice in any dimension , doping and temperature .",
    "the t - j model is one of the simplest models describing doped mott insulators in the limit that the on - site coulomb repulsion is much larger than the hopping integral @xmath43 .",
    "this model is composed of two terms , @xmath44 , with the hopping term@xmath45and the superexchange term@xmath46where @xmath47 * *  * * and @xmath48 are on - site spin and number operators , respectively , and the hilbert space is constrained by eq .",
    "( [ mottness ] ) as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ hilbert ] and the basic processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ t - j ] .",
    "it can be rigorously demonstrated @xcite that the partition function @xmath49tr@xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) in the reduced hilbert space ( figs .",

    ", it remains irreparable as @xmath53 , with an additional sign contribution by @xmath61 where @xmath62 counts the total number of hole - hole exchanges on the path @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "[ loop](b ) ) .    note that at half - filling , @xmath63 and there is no nontrivial sign in the model , which is totally bosonized as pointed out above .",
    "in essence , although the original electrons are fermions , due to the no double occupancy constraint ( [ mottness ] ) , the fermi - dirac statistics will no longer play a role in the restricted hilbert space as far as the real physical process is concerned . at finite doping ,",
    "the nontrivial sign does reemerge in eq .",

    "( [ pstring1 ] ) .",
    "although such sign structure is solely associated with the doped holes and looks much reduced  as compared to the full fermi signs associated with the original electrons , the phase string effect in @xmath56 will lead to the very singular effect : for any loop of a hole , a mere change of one spin orientation can result in a total change of the sign in @xmath56 and thus the phase interference from constructive to destructive , or _",
    "vice versa_. in particular , in contrast to the conventional statistical problem involving the identical particles , here the phase string effect is caused by the exchange between the holes and spins , and so a mutual statistical effect will emerge @xcite .",
    "figure [ oneloop ] illustrates some typical phase strings picked up by a closed loop motion of a hole in a spin background which is in ( a ) the nagaoka state in which spins are all polarized along the @xmath64-axis ; ( b ) an afm state with spins forming a nel order ; ( c ) a spin disordered state . by noting that a closed path of the hole always involves an even number of steps in a bipartite lattice",
    ", one can easily see that only in ( a ) the phase interference due to phase string effect is always constructive , whereas in ( b ) and ( c ) the phase string effect becomes nontrivial and singular since even one spin flip can result in a total sign change of @xmath58 .",
    "but in the partition function , the probability for ( a ) is extremely rare at finite @xmath3 and thus the phase string effect is generally crucial in mediating the entanglement  between the spin and charge degrees of freedom at finite doping .",
    "figure [ fermion ] further shows how fermionic objects may arise from the bound pairs of holes and spins , which are free of the phase string effect but retain the fermion signs between themselves via @xmath61 in eq .",

    "in the prototype rvb state ( [ bcs ] ) , the mottness simply implies the gutzwiller projection onto a hilbert space that excludes double occupancy of the electrons .",
    "note that double occupancy is still allowed in @xmath5 , which is basically a fermi liquid with the cooper channel instability .",
    "a fundamental question is if such a gutzwiller projection @xmath6 acting on a suitably chosen ordinary  state @xmath5 ( which may be considered as the ground state of an effective _ local _ hamiltonian of fermions ) is sufficient to capture the essential physics of the mottness ?    through this article",
    "i have pedagogically reviewed the efforts weng_07,weng_11,zaanen_09 to reexamine this important question .",
    "the basic conclusion is that , as a matter of principle , @xmath5 can not be ordinary  as described above and the singular feedback  effect of the constrained hilbert space should turn the effective hamiltonian of @xmath5 , if exists , into a new paradigm of non - fermi - dirac statistics . in other words",
    ", we have reached the conclusion that the essential physics of the mottness is not simply about imposing the constraint ( [ mottness ] ) on the hilbert space .",
    "rather , an electron fractionalization with mutual fractional statistics must take place in @xmath5 as a general consequence of the mottness @xcite .",
    "the resulting new ground state @xcite as given in eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) is distinct from the original rvb state @xcite in eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) by that the neutral rvb and cooper channels are clearly differentiated .",
    "it implies an electron fractionalization in which three essential types of correlations are explicitly separated and intrinsically embedded : i.e. , the afm correlations in @xmath22 ; the cooper pairing of the doped holes ; and the mutual influence / competition between these two channels via a mutual statistical phase in @xmath36 .",
    "as emphasized in this article , an accurate description of the afm state is a crucial starting point .",
    "so does the singular doping effect , which brings in the fundamental change in the statistical sign structure known as the phase string effect @xcite .",
    "based on these two basic properties of the mott physics , the pseudogap phenomenon and superconductivity arise naturally as a self - organization of the three essential types of correlations mentioned above . without holes ,",
    "the long - range afm order will always win in @xmath22 , which provides a highly accurate description @xcite of the ground state of the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "a sufficient concentration of doped holes will eventually turn the antiferromagnetism in @xmath22 into a true  spin liquid state with short - range afm correlations . by doing",
    "so the cooper paired holes can gain phase coherence to realize a high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "the pseudogap region is merely a crossover from the long - range afm order to superconducting order since the latter two are incompatible in nature .",
    "this incompatibility decides the complex crossover phenomenon of the pseudogap physics @xcite .",
    "there is nothing mysterious about them once the essence of the mottness is properly understood .",
    "deep inside the superconducting state , the spins are short - range rvb paired in @xmath22 such that the statistical signs get cancelled in @xmath36 , and the state ( [ gs ] ) resembles eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) proposed by anderson @xcite in that the cooper pairing is driven by the spin rvb pairing upon doping .",
    "the d - wave pairing symmetry and the rvb state as a prototype pseudogap phase were actually predicted @xcite before experimental discoveries .",
    "in fact , in a modified version of eq .",
    "( bcs ) , the fugacity  has been also introduced to stress the tendency towards a separation of the neutral rvb and cooper pairings @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the statistical signs in @xmath36 of eq . ( [ gs ] ) will play a critical role in dictating how the spin excitation affects the superconductivity and _ vice versa_. in order to properly understand the superconducting phase transition , the nature of pseudogap physics , and even the strange metal behavior at high temperatures , the mutual statistics encoded in  @xmath36 can not be omitted in a theory based on the doped mott insulator approach .",
