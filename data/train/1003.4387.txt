    "i.e. , the classical action up to nearest ( in terms of @xmath334 ) singularity determines the number of terms of expansion ( [ 5.3.1 ] ) for best accuracy . taking into account that the expansion in sec.5.4.1 is over even powers of @xmath272 , one can see that ( [ 5.1.8 ] ) and ( [ 5.3.8 ] ) coincide , but the result ( [ 5.3.8 ] ) is obtained in the general case .",

    "we can replace @xmath336 by the leading term of expansion ( [ 5.3.7 ] ) .",

    "one of the realizations of this experiment is the following .",
    "after a radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from a metastable @xmath341-state two photons are emitted having spins with opposite directions @xmath342 since the initial ( @xmath341 ) and final ( @xmath343 ) states of hydrogen atom have angular momentum equal to zero .",
    "however , the orientation of each spin is uncertain in the same manner as a position of a particle in a potential well .",
    "if the measurement of the direction of the spin of the first photon is performed the second photon takes the opposite direction of spin , according to ( [ 6.1.1 ] ) , independently of the distance between photons .",
    "the actual fixation of the spin orientation of the second photon happens immediately and it is an actual changing of its state ( bell s inequality @xcite ) .",
    "it does not contradict the relativistic restriction @xmath344 because the carrier of information is not material , i.e. it has no relation to the transfer of mass or energy .",
    "recent experiment @xcite demonstrates that the speed of quantum information is at least @xmath345 greater than the speed of light @xmath65 .",
    "this experiment confirms that an information field does exist . notice that this interpretation is in contradiction with wave - particle duality :",
    "the wave - type schrdinger equation describes just information field @xmath346 .",
    "thus , there is no duality because of two different physical substances - particles and information field .",
    "the interaction between particles and information fields is measurement which can not be formalized , i.e. to be written in mathematical form .",
