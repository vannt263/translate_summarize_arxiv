    "due to its relevance on fundamental problems of condensed matter physics , the statics and dynamics of elastic manifolds are a subject of great current interest . in general ,",
    "elastic manifolds can be related to problems such as domain wall motion in magnetic  @xcite or ferroelectric  @xcite materials , vortex matter in high temperature superconductors  @xcite , grain boundary fluctuations in materials science  @xcite , interface dynamics in deposition problems  @xcite , or crack propagation  @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients characterizing these problems might include the elastic energy of the internal degrees of freedom , the quenched disorder , and the interaction between different components of the system .",
    "it is known that when quenched disorder is present , these systems presents glassy characteristics such as disorder roughness exponents or non - stationary dynamics . in order to better understand such features as the slow out - of - equilibrium dynamics ,",
    "it is important to study in the first place the properties of simpler models , i.e. systems without disorder and/or interactions .",
    "it has been shown that even the simple edwards - wilkinson equation , a very well studied model of interface dynamics , presents glassy behavior  @xcite .",
    "since this is an harmonic solvable model , it is possible to obtain from it a lot of information about the out - of - equilibrium dynamics , such as the multiplicative aging scaling of the two - times roughness , the inclusion of finite size equilibration , and the generalization of scaling distribution functions .",
    "it is important to understand how these properties , obtained for the simple ew equation , can be generalized to other models as the non - linear kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation  @xcite , different discrete models  @xcite , and even different dimensions . for these cases ,",
    "however , the universal exponents characterizing static and dynamic properties might change , and then it becomes important to understand how such a change affects the glassy properties .    in particular , the study of the non - linear contributions to the elasticity should allow a better understanding of the glassy properties of more realistic elastic models . in this sense ,",
    "the study of the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the pure kpz equation serve as a first step to rationalize the aging behavior reported in  @xcite , where a driven non - linear elastic model with quenched disorder was analyzed .",
    "moreover , it shall also give a first insight into how the general picture obtained for the ew case can be generalized to more complex , and analytically non - solvable , models .",
    "in addition , it is now clear how important fluctuations are to describe the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of complex systems  @xcite .",
    "the thermally induced distribution functions of a given quantity contain more information than the first moments , which resulted in the proposal of using these fluctuations to characterize different universality classes  @xcite .",
    "the roughness distribution of elastic lines was studied in the steady state for various models on the saturation regime  @xcite , and also in the dynamic growth regime  @xcite .",
    "it was also analyzed in the context of depinning of elastic lines in random environments  @xcite and in relation to the @xmath0 noise  @xcite .",
    "its generalization to non - equilibrium situations has also been recently considered  @xcite . within this context",
    ", it seems important to test the scaling of the out - of - equilibrium roughness distribution for the kpz equation .",
    "therefore , with the aim of analyzing the glassy properties of non - linear elastic models , the numerical solution of the kpz equation in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions is presented in this work .",
    "two - times correlation functions , as the roughness and structure factor , are computed and compared with the ew results .",
    "the distribution function of the roughness in the aging regime is also considered .",
    "these results allow to generalize those previously obtained for the ew equation by properly including the kpz universal exponents .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the numerical details of the simulations , together with the out - of - equilibrium protocol , are presented in .",
    "the glassy properties for the different two - times quantities are presented and discussed in .",
    "finally , presents the conclusions .",
    "in the present section the numerical details of the simulation of the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the kpz equation are presented .",
    "this equation describes , in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , the evolution of a one - dimensional non - linear elastic object embedded in a two - dimensional space in the limit of small fluctuations .",
    "the non - linear contribution is a first order correction to elasticity , thus allowing the characterization of the line in terms of the univaluated field @xmath1 .",

    "the noise @xmath10 is now a random number uniformly distributed in @xmath11 .",
    "the particular choice of the finite difference representation of the non - linear term is given by @xmath12 ^ 2 + \\left[x_{i+1}(t)-x_i(t)\\right]\\left[x_i(t)-x_{i-1}(t)\\right]+\\left[x_i(t)-x_{i-1}(t)\\right]^2,\\ ] ] which not only gives the correct exponents in the kpz universality class but also the correct prefactors and the correct fluctuations in the saturation regime  @xcite .",
    "this is important in order to perform a direct comparison with the ew case . in this work ,",
    "the parameters used to numerically solve the kpz equation are @xmath13 ( except for the computation of distribution functions where the values @xmath14 and @xmath15 are also used in order to highlight the scaling properties ) , @xmath16 , which sets the time units , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . for the thermal average , @xmath19 noise realizations were considered for the evaluation of two - times correlations . in order to compute the roughness distributions ,",
    "@xmath20 thermal noise realizations were used for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while @xmath21 were used for @xmath13 .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the kpz equation was analyzed adopting the usual two - times protocol used to study glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "starting from a flat configuration , the system is first equilibrated at a given initial temperature @xmath22 .",
    "this means that the system evolves until the stationary state is reached , corresponding to the size - dependent saturation regime of the roughness .",
    "then , the temperature is suddenly changed to the working temperature @xmath7 , and the time is set to zero .",
    "two - times correlation functions are then defined in terms of the waiting time @xmath23 and the elapsed time @xmath24 . in the present work ,",
    "the working temperature was set to @xmath25 and different initial temperatures , both smaller and larger than @xmath7 , were studied . in particular , the values @xmath26 , which corresponds to a perfectly flat initial condition , and @xmath27 were used .",
    "in the following , the results for different two - times correlation quantities are described .",
    "particular attention is given to correlation functions showing a clearly non - trivial out - of - equilibrium generalization of the scaling properties previously found in the ew equation .",

    "this defines the growth exponent @xmath37 , the roughness exponent @xmath38 and the dynamic exponent @xmath39 , related through the scaling relation @xmath40 .",
    "the values of these exponents are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for the ew universality class , and @xmath41 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for kpz universality class , both in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the two - times roughness , which is the out - of - equilibrium generalization of the one - time roughness  , is defined as @xmath46 ^ 2 \\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] this quantity measures the relative fluctuation between the line s configuration at times @xmath23 and @xmath47 .",
    "it was recently shown that , for the ew equation with finite size @xmath48 , the two - times roughness ages  @xcite , now scaling as @xmath49 .",
    "the aging regime may be understood as the pre - asymptotic non - equilibrium regime prior to finite size equilibration , which takes a time @xmath32 . when @xmath50 , the stationary solution and the family - vicsek scaling are recovered .",
    "on the other hand , in the aging regime @xmath51 , the scaling function behaves as @xmath52 with @xmath43 and @xmath41 the ew scaling exponents . in the case",
    "where @xmath53 , the roughness scales as @xmath54 , with @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "this scaling describes a multiplicative aging scenario   the roughness can be also written as @xmath59 , with @xmath60 for @xmath53 and @xmath61 for @xmath58 .",
    "emphasizes the fact that this corresponds indeed to multiplicative aging . ] for the two - times roughness  @xcite , and effectively corresponds to the infinite size limit , @xmath62 . on the other hand , when @xmath63 , i.e. in the saturation regime , the scaling function @xmath64 behaves as @xmath65 for @xmath51 and @xmath66 for @xmath50 , thus leading to a @xmath23-dependent saturation value for the roughness which evolves from @xmath67 to @xmath68 while @xmath23 increases .",
    "the scaling form generalizes the family - vicsek scaling to a non - equilibrium situation .",
    "it is interesting to test if this generalization is valid for the kpz equation , using its respective exponents .",
    "this point is addressed in the following .    in this work ,",
    "the two - times roughness @xmath69 , has been numerically obtained from the evolution of the discrete kpz equation , and it is shown in  .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to initial conditions with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the different curves correspond to different waiting times , as indicated .",
    "after an initial time interval where the components of the line fluctuate independently , @xmath72 , the line becomes correlated in the longitudinal direction and starts aging .",
    "then , ones the line is correlated , two different time regimes are observed , corresponding to @xmath73 larger or smaller than @xmath74 , and both showing aging . when the waiting time is larger than the saturation time , aging stops and the stationary situation is reached .    in the growth regime , for each waiting time , the curves jump from the equilibrated asymptote to the non - equilibrated asymptote with increasing @xmath73 .",
    "both asymptotes are growing as @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the kpz value .",
    "therefore , a multiplicative aging scenario with the corresponding kpz growth exponent is found . in the saturation regime",
    "the curves jump from the @xmath67 asymptotic value , corresponding to @xmath77 , to the value @xmath68 , corresponding to the stationary solution .",
    "the values of the numerically obtained prefactors @xmath78 and @xmath79 are equal , within numerical accuracy , to those analytically found for the ew equation , i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 . it is well known that the kpz and ew continuum equations have the same steady state solution for the distribution function of a given configuration in the saturation regime  @xcite . furthermore , it has been also shown that this property holds for the discretized model used here  @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that the @xmath23-dependent saturation values obtained in this work coincide with the ones for the ew equation suggests that the non - stationary solution in the saturation regime may also be the same for both models .",
    "shows the @xmath23-dependent saturation value for both initial conditions , and compares it with the ew equation solution  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic limits are clearly the same , and a small difference is observed in the crossover region .",
    "these results support the generalized family - vicsek scaling , although the growth regime is too short in time to accurately test the @xmath82 scaling .",
    "larger system sizes would be necessary for a good test using the two - times roughness .",
    "however , a better way to observe the growing correlation length associated with aging is to focus on the two - times structure factor .",
    "this quantity also reflects the scaling properties of the roughness , but a better scaling test is obtained , as described in the next section .",
    "the one - time dynamical structure factor is usually defined as @xmath83 where @xmath84 represents the fourier modes of a given configuration at time @xmath47 , and where the discreetness of the lattice was already taken into account with the wave vectors given by @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "this structure factor gives information on how the fluctuations of the modes evolve in time , containing also information on the growing correlation length  @xcite .",
    "the definition should not be confused with the dynamical structure factor @xmath87 , which gives information on how a given mode correlates between times @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this dynamical structure factor presents non - trivial stretched exponential relaxation characteristics in the kpz case  @xcite .    in general",
    ", the structure factor scales as @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath92 behaves as @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath96 , indicating that there exists a growing correlation length @xmath97 .",
    "when @xmath98 , the saturation regime is reached and @xmath99 is independent of the time @xmath47 .",
    "the two - times generalization of the structure factor is defined as  @xcite @xmath100 this definition allows for the characterization of the fluctuations of a given mode between @xmath23 and @xmath47 . for the ew equation",
    ", the two - times structure factor can be written as a scaling function expressed in terms of the quotients @xmath101 and @xmath102 , in analogy with the roughness scaling .",
    "however , the focus here will be set on how the structure factor behaves on the @xmath23-dependent saturation regime , which gives clear evidence of the growing correlation lengths .",
    "then , for @xmath63 , i.e. in the saturation regime , the structure factor is computed for different @xmath23 values as @xmath103 it was recently reported for the case of the ew equation that @xmath104 , with @xmath105  @xcite",
    ". the scaling function @xmath106 behaves as @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "the particular wave vector @xmath111 precisely separates two regimes . while the regime with large wave vectors , @xmath110 , is equilibrated at the working temperature , small wave vectors , @xmath108 , still have memory of the initial temperature .",
    "note that in contrast with the one - time structure factor , the two - times generalization contains information on the dynamic exponent in the saturation regime due to its @xmath23-dependence .    shows the structure factor @xmath112 as a function of @xmath113 for different waiting times , obtained in the present work .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the structure factor clearly presents the @xmath114 decay , but changes between two asymptotes at a given @xmath23-dependent value . in order to emphasize this behavior ,",
    "the insets show the same data plotted as @xmath115 against @xmath113 .",
    "the crossover between the two asymptotes is the kind of behavior described by the scaling function @xmath106 .",
    "indeed , the two asymptotic values are @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively , indicated with dotted lines in the insets .",
    "these values correspond to those previously obtained for the ew equation , again suggesting a strong connection between the non - stationary solution of the ew and kpz equations in the saturation regime .",
    "this feature is stressed in , where the scaling of the structure factor with @xmath118 is shown for the two initial conditions .",
    "the data are also compared with the ew equation solution  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that although the asymptotic values coincide , the intermediate dynamic regime does not perfectly match .",
    "this might be related to the fact that the dynamic exponent is also involved in the scaling function @xmath92 , which goes beyond both models having the same roughness exponent in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "another quantity which has proved to be very useful in the analysis of the non - equilibrium dynamics in systems of interacting particles is the incoherent scattering function  @xcite .",
    "in the context of elastic lines it can be defined as  @xcite @xmath119 } \\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] it has been shown that due to the gaussian character of the variables involved in the solution of the ew equation , the scattering function can be written in terms of the two - times roughness in a very simple way as @xmath120 which establishes a clear relation between scattering functions and diffusion - like correlations . in the growth regime , @xmath53 , it has been already shown that the roughness behaves as @xmath54 , with @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 , leading to a stretched exponential relaxation of the scattering function , i.e. @xmath121 this equation involves two stretched exponentials sharing the same exponent @xmath37 but different prefactors .",
    "this relation trivially holds for gaussian variables , however its validity for the kpz equation must be still tested .",
    "\\(a ) presents the scattering function for the kpz equation obtained numerically at different @xmath122 and @xmath23 values .",
    "the scattering function presents a strong @xmath122-dependent saturation regime , on which the @xmath123 factor of the exponential competes with the @xmath124 factor coming from the saturation regime of the roughness .",
    "therefore , at low @xmath122 values a saturation regime can be observed , while at large @xmath122 values the scattering function decays faster to a near - zero value .",
    "this is clearly observed for the selected values @xmath125 and @xmath126 in ( a ) .",
    "the generic form of the @xmath127 curves is similar to the one obtained for the ew equation . in order to test the validity of",
    ", the scattering function for @xmath128 is plotted in ( b ) together with the values @xmath129 obtained using the results for the roughness presented in  ( a ) .",
    "the results in ( b ) prove that relation   also holds for the kpz equation .",
    "one could have expected this relation to hold in the saturation regime , since the steady state solution is the same for ew and kpz equations .",
    "however , the fact that it also holds in _ all _ the dynamic @xmath73 and @xmath23-dependent growth regime is absolutely non - trivial , since the fluctuations of the kpz are not expected to be gaussian distributed . the same results , i.e. the scattering function being directly obtained from the roughness through  , were obtained for @xmath27 ( not shown here ) .",
    "it has been previously proposed that the roughness distribution function in the saturation regime scales with the average roughness as the only scaling parameter  @xcite .",
    "this proposition can be extended to all the dynamic regime in steady state , allowing to write the roughness distribution as  @xcite @xmath130.\\ ] ] here , the fluctuating roughness @xmath131 should be distinguished from its average value @xmath132 , which explicitly contains the time dependence . the last argument in states that scaling works for curves with the same time scale @xmath133 , thus accounting for finite size effects .",
    "this scaling relation can also be generalized to include the waiting time dependence by considering also the @xmath102 scale  @xcite , thus leading to @xmath134.\\ ] ] this last scaling relation was analitically obtained for the ew equation  @xcite and numerically obtained for a directed polymer in random media model  @xcite .    using the results obtained in the present work a test of the scaling relation   for the kpz equation can be performed .",
    "the result is shown in  , obtained using the roughness distribution for three system sizes , @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 , and different times @xmath73 and @xmath23 . in panel ( a ) , the bare distribution functions are shown , while panel ( b ) shows the scaling function @xmath135 , with @xmath136 .",
    "these results correspond to @xmath26 .",
    "since the difference between the selected system sizes is a factor four , the saturation time is scaled by a factor @xmath137 .",
    "then to keep the quotient @xmath102 fixed , the waiting time should also be scaled by the same factor @xmath137 ; the same holds for the value of @xmath73 if one wants to scale with @xmath101 .",
    "it is shown that all the curves in panel ( a ) collapse into three sets of curves in panel ( b ) , corresponding to different pairs of @xmath138 values , in agreement with the scaling relation  .",
    "this scaling of the roughness distribution function also accounts for the saturation regime , leading to the known stationary solution .",
    "a direct comparison with the ew results in the dynamic regime is not possible here because the scaling factor is different ; in the present case it should be @xmath139 with @xmath42 for ew . instead",
    ", the stationary saturation solution of the ew case  @xcite is plotted in panel ( b ) , with a continuous dashed line , showing again that the numerical solution of the kpz equation asymptotically tends to the same distribution function in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions@xcite .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the kpz equation has been studied in detail using numerical simulations .",
    "it corresponds to the relaxation of a non - linear interface from a given initial condition and it has been shown here that a complicated glassy dynamics emerges , as also does for the ew equation  @xcite .",
    "the system size @xmath48 was incorporated in the analysis , thus allowing to reach finite size equilibration after a time @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the out - of - equilibrium regime described here effectively corresponds to a pre - asymptotic regime before equilibrium is reached .",
    "one can imagine a very large system size whose equilibration time @xmath74 is much larger than the observation time , making the aging regime the relevant observable time regime . in a sense",
    "this is expected when quenched disorder is taken into account , where the dynamics becomes much slower and the equilibration time goes beyond the observation time .",
    "thus , the main aging characteristics described here are of key importance for analyzing the non - equilibrium dynamics of problems which include other components like disorder , external forces or line - line interactions .",
    "it has been shown here that the main characteristics of the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the ew equation can be extended to the kpz equation .",
    "one should only be careful of using the proper scaling exponents .",
    "for instance , from the scaling of the two - times roughness and structure factor the existence of the growing correlation length is revealed , which allows to rationalize the different time regimes . in terms of elapsed time @xmath73 and waiting time @xmath23",
    ", it is the relative value of the correlation lengths @xmath140 and @xmath141 which defines the scaling properties in the growth regime . when considering the saturation regime , the size of the system @xmath142 , associated to the saturation time @xmath74 ,",
    "should also be considered .",
    "thus , it is the competition between these three length scales , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath143 , and its relation to the corresponding times through the dynamic exponent @xmath39 , which define the aging dynamics of the system .",
    "results concerning the scattering function have been also presented .",
    "this correlation function presents a well defined stretched exponential decay , which is indeed commonly observed in different glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the scattering function is directly related to the roughness through equation  .",
    "this simple exponential relation was previously analytically obtained for the ew equation based on the gaussian character of the fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "although in the saturation regime the fluctuations in the kpz equation are also gaussian distributed , in the growth regime this is not necessarily true .",
    "thus , the fact that both scattering function and roughness are related in this simple way for the whole two - times dependent dynamics is a non - trivial result , posing new questions about the relation between scattering functions and displacements fluctuations out of equilibrium , a fact already pointed out in colloidal glass experiments  @xcite .",
    "finally , the scaling of the roughness distribution has been studied .",
    "the scaling in equation   for the distribution function , which depends on the relative time scales @xmath144 and @xmath145 , has been tested here and a good collapse of the data was obtained .",
    "this indicates once more that the correct variables which include both dynamics and finite size effects are the relative scales between @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , it has been highlighted here that the scaling relations analytically found for the ew equation are quite robust , allowing also for a good description of the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the kpz equation .",
    "while the present work focused on the numerical solution of the continuum equation , it could also be interesting to test these ideas in discrete models of interface dynamics .",
    "finally , in order to further test these scaling relations , it would also be interesting to study higher dimensions for which the scaling exponents are different .",
