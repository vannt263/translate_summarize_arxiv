    "inorganic / organic hybrid systems comprised of small metal nanoparticles and different organic adsorbates like peptides and dyes represent a fascinating topic with prospective applications in , e.g. , catalysis and bioelectronics ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    despite considerable progress",
    ", electronic structure calculations of such hybrid systems with non - covalent interactions still pose a challenge for quantum chemical methods that are known for their moderate computational costs .",
    "in particular , standard density functional theory ( dft ) techniques fail to predict the adsorption energies for aromatic molecules on noble metal surfaces in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "often this discrepancy can be attributed to the inadequate treatment of the dispersion interaction within most currently available functionals @xcite .",
    "this holds true in particular for weakly physisorbed adsorbates , where the incorrect estimation of dispersion interaction might have a much more pronounced impact on the quality of results than in case of covalently bound complexes @xcite .",
    "the extension of standard dft to account for dispersion effects is an active area of research ( for a review , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the dft - d2 approach of grimme , @xmath5 parameters for the first part of the periodic table are and proved to give an adequate description of non - covalent interactions . for heavy atoms , however , no reliable parameters within the d2 model are available @xcite .",
    "as proposed by grimme , unknown coefficients could be deduced from atomic properties by the london formula @xcite .",
    "an alternative way to obtain dispersion corrections is the so - called hybrid qm : qm approach @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the dispersion energy is considered as the difference between the adsorption energies for adsorbate - substrate complex obtained with ab initio theory and dft . for absorption of pyridine on gold clusters",
    ", it has been shown by tonigold and gro that qm : qm employing a mp2 ( second order mller - plesset perturbation theory ) reference gave substantially better agreement with experiment compared to standard d2 @xcite .    later , grimme has introduced the much advanced dft - d3 method , taking into account the surrounding of the atoms by means of coordination numbers in contrast to dft - d2 where by construction the dispersion coefficients are not system - dependent . in this approach ,",
    "@xmath4 coefficients were derived from averaged dipole polarizabilities at imaginary frequencies calculated with time - dependent dft ( td - dft ) , while eighth order coefficients @xmath6 follow from a simple recursion rules for the higher - multipole terms @xcite .",
    "dft - d3 has been shown to provide higher accuracy and broader applicability for 94 elements of the periodic table than the earlier versions .",
    "finally , a more rigorous development sets the focus on the determination of an explicit non - local correlation functional from first principles .",
    "@xmath7 recently , some progress in increasing their efficiency has been achieved what would enable their future application to large systems @xcite .",
    "for example , vdw - inclusive dft methods allow to reliably model adsorption of molecules on surfaces @xcite , for review see @xcite .",
    "although benchmarks for validation of new dispersion - corrected dft approaches have been reported ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) , mainly non - metal containing systems have been considered such as the s22 standard set and nucleobase pairs .",
    "exceptions include the application of dft - d to the adsorption of aliphatic and aromatic molecules on metal surfaces like gold , silver , palladium , and copper @xcite , which gave a good agreement with experimental adsorption energies , in contrast to conventional dft .",
    "however , note that for aul@xmath8-c@xmath9h@xmath10 model systems , for instance , the dft - d3 performance is comparable with that of conventional dft @xcite .",
    "an alternative for improving the dft - d performance is to use system - dependent @xmath4 coefficients , rescaled on the basis of an embedding model ; examples include the adsorption of small organic molecules on mgo and nacl surfaces @xcite . in conclusion",
    ", the usage of dispersion - corrected dft approaches for systems including metal - containing surfaces or clusters clearly needs further investigation and comprehensive benchmarking in order to become a standard method comprising the modest computational costs of dft with accurate predictions .",
    "the present study aims at establishing an empirical dispersion correction for the system ( irps ) shown in fig .",
    "[ irpsscheme ] and its derivatives , bound to small silver clusters ag@xmath2 . in doing",

    "@xmath4 coefficients for the heavy atoms .",
    "our choice of the system is motivated by the use of ir(iii ) complexes as photosensitizers in photocatalytic water splitting . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , the homogeneous catalytic system consisting of irps combined with the sacrificial reductant triethylamine and a water reduction iron catalyst has been demonstrated .",
    "hybrid systems consisting of irps and small metal clusters hold the promise to obtain a heterogeneous catalytic system with improved performance .",
    "the interaction of irps with small silver clusters ( 16 silver atoms ) and in particular changes in absorption spectra upon binding have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite employing the long - range corrected dft ( lc - blyp ) approach .",
    "the obtained results demonstrated strong changes in the absorption spectra of the combined systems as compared with the pure constituents . to proceed with larger metal clusters it is desirable to have a reliable method which properly describes binding interactions at low computational cost such as dft - d .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we briefly recall the main features of the dft - d approach and outline the computational details in section [ sec : comp ] .",
    "second , in section [ sec : res ] we present the results of fitting @xmath4 coefficients for ir and ag atoms employing the qm : qm procedure .",

    "initial geometry optimizations of , , and complexes as well as of pure organic and metal parts were carried out using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functional of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite along with the def2-sv(p ) basis set @xcite .",
    "optimizations were carried out without any symmetry constraints .",
    "starting geometries of small silver clusters ag@xmath2 , @xmath3=220 were taken from previous studies @xcite . on these optimized geometries , single point calculations with pbe , random phase approximation ( rpa ) , and mp2 were done employing the def2-tzv(p ) basis set @xcite .",
    "the binding energy , @xmath11 , has been defined as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the total energies of the relaxed complex , dye molecule , and silver cluster , respectively .",
    "it goes without saying that at the moment for the present system , for example , ccsd(t ) reference calculations are out of reach .",
    "higher order perturbation theory ( mp3 , mp4 ) does nt improve the situation as shown in ref .",
    "an alternative is the rpa method , which is of slightly higher computational cost as mp2 , see @xcite .",
    "unlike mp2 , the rpa method does not suffer from problems like infinite energies for small bandgap systems and it was shown to provide an adequate description for non - covalent interactions @xcite .",
    "these authors also pointed out that sufficiently accurate binding energies of weakly bound systems can be obtained only by using complete basis set extrapolation or basis sets larger than quadruple- .",
    "but , this level is hardly affordable for heavy elements like ag or ir , not to mention that besides regular basis sets one would need auxiliary ones to perform ri - calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are forced to restrict our considerations to basis sets of triple-  quality .",
    "at least for the case of mp2 we have performed a convergence study and concluded that def2-tzvp binding energies are almost saturated with respect to basis set ; e.g. the corresponding binding energy in mp2 of were -0.887 , -1.000 , and -0.961 ev for def2-sv(p ) , def2-tzvp , and def2-qzvp , respectively .    for the rpa calculations we have employed the resolution - of - the - identity approximation ( ri - rpa ) for the two - electron integrals @xcite",
    ", the corresponding auxiliary basis sets were taken from refs .",
    "the ri - rpa calculations were done on top of the pbe converged set of kohn - sham molecular orbitals with the number of grid points set equal to 30 . in the rpa and mp2 calculations ,",
    "the frozen - core approximation was used to speed up the calculations and to avoid the using basis sets with additional tight core correlation functions . according to default selection ,",
    "orbitals below -3 @xmath16 were frozen , i.e. 1s of nitrogen and carbon atoms , 4s of silver and 5s of iridium .",

    "we assume the dispersion energy to be the energy difference between binding energies calculated with the reference ( rpa or mp2 ) and dft ( for discussion see section [ sec : res]c ) .",
    "the application of quite large basis sets allows one to neglect the bsse correction as it was pointed out by grimme @xcite .",
    "differences in the binding energies between mp2/rpa and pbe for different numbers of silver atoms have been least - square fitted using eq .",
    "( [ edisp ] ) in order to obtain atomic coefficients .",
    "because of the fact that the target systems ( irps - ag@xmath2 ) include two metal elements the task was divided into two steps .",
    "first , we considered structures consisting of the same small silver clusters and phenylpyridin ( ppyh ) or bipyridin ( bpy ) molecules . for these cases , we only needed to approximate the dispersion coefficient for silver .",
    "this has been done using mp2 and rpa references .",
    "second , we regarded the set of structures and did the same fitting procedure applying the coefficient for silver calculated at the first stage .",
    "however , for computational reasons this was possible for the mp2 reference only .",
    "alternative to this two step procedure we approximated the two coefficients simultaneously using all dependencies . in this respect , the addition of sets of model structures , including separate ligands as organic part , was reasonable because the interaction between irps and silver clusters is mainly due to the dispersion interaction with ligands , with the central ir atom being shielded .",
    "for each given combination of silver cluster and organic molecule , we have first optimized from 2 to 5 different structures starting from various initial relative orientations . for brevity , in fig .",
    "[ bpy - agn - examples ] only some examples of optimized complexes are plotted , for the full list of structures and their notation see the supplementary material @xcite . in case of ppyh or bpy aromatic molecules ,",
    "silver clusters are normally strongly bound to the n atoms of ppyh and bpy ( fig .",
    "[ bpy - agn - examples]a ) , which is impossible when interacting with irps where n atoms are oriented towards the central iridium atom .",
    "nevertheless , such structures have been also taken into account because we do not want to exclude the possibility of superposition of dispersion interactions . in structures where there is no direct interaction between ag and n atoms ,",
    "the silver cluster is bound to one of the rings ( see fig .  [ bpy - agn - examples]b ) . for the ppyh molecule , in most cases the cluster",
    "is attached to the heterocycle .",
    "still another possibility is that one of the silver cluster s planes interacts with the @xmath29 aromatic system and is approximately parallel to the plane of one or both aromatic rings ( see fig .  [ bpy - agn - examples]c , d ) .    upon complex formation the bond lengths of the silver clusters , bpy , and ppyh",
    "do not strongly change as compared to gas phase .",
    "the most pronounced changes occur in ppyh and bpy torsional angles between the aromatic rings .",
    "the changes for bpy are in the range of 1 - 6 with several exceptions where these changes achieve values in the range 26 - 33 . for ppyh , there are even more cases where changes are in the range of 23 - 35",
    ". this could be due to the fact that the phenyl - ring of ppyh is repelled once the silver cluster comes close to bind with the n atom .",
    "the distances between the closest atoms of the interacting subsystems are 2.3 - 4.0  .    in our previous study on the irps bound to small ( @xmath30 ) silver clusters",
    "@xcite , we found that configurations in which is situated in the cavities between ligands are the lowest in energy .",
    "note that in all cases the interactions are `` weak '' and no chemical bonds are formed .",
    "here we extend this study to geometries up to 20 silver atoms , however , focussing on those structures where the cluster is located in the  ppy - ppy  cavity and @xmath3 is even .",
    "similar to the small systems @xcite , the geometry optimization was carried out without symmetry constraints , except for some cases where the @xmath31 point symmetry of the irps part @xcite was retained .",
    "some examples of complexes can be found in fig .",
    "[ irps - agn - examples ] .",
    "binding energies per silver atom of all structures ( ppyh - ag@xmath2 , , and ) selected for further c@xmath32 coefficient fitting are plotted in fig .",
    "[ binding_all_ev ] ( details are given in the supplementary material @xcite ) . in general the range of binding energies ( 0.01 - 0.59 ev ) is comparable for all sets of model structures .",
    "this corresponds to physisorption of the organic molecule on the silver clusters , with binding energies being about 10 times smaller compared to binding energies of silver atoms within large nanoparticles @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ binding_all_ev ] one can also notice that @xmath33 decreases with increasing number of silver atoms in the system .",
    "note that the rpa calculations were only computationally affordable for structures containing up to 10 silver atoms and bpy or ppyh but not irps as an organic counterpart . concerning the discrepancies between the pbe and mp2 calculations ,",
    "it is observed that they are more pronounced for systems , with mp2 results naturally being always larger than those of pbe .",
    "the rpa binding energies for and lie in between pbe and mp2 ones , with rpa energies being in average 24% lower that mp2 .",
    "next , these data on binding energies are used to optimize the dispersion coefficients .      using the qm : qm approach we obtained @xmath4 coefficients for ag and ir in two different ways as outlined in the computational details section .",
    "the coefficients obtained either in two - steps or by simultaneous fitting as well as corresponding root mean squared deviations ( rmsd ) for binding energy fitting are collected in table  [ c6_coef ] . for silver ,",
    "the dispersion coefficient was obtained using both rpa and mp2 as references .",
    "the @xmath4 coefficients used in the d2 model @xcite are also given in table  [ c6_coef ] .",
    "it should be noted that for ag and ir only estimates of coefficients are available in d2 .",
    "for example @xmath34 was assumed to be an average of preceding group viii and following group iii element .",
    "the corresponding @xmath4 coefficients of the d3 model are also included in the table  [ c6_coef ] but two points should be highlighted before the comparison with the coefficients obtained in the current work .",
    "first , they are coordination number dependent ; in the table only values which were applied for the systems under investigation are collected .",
    "second , to fit all the dispersion forces in dft - d3 higher - order terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 are also used .",
    "we also included in table  [ c6_coef ] the values of @xmath4 obtained within the combination of dispersion - corrected density - functional theory ( the dft+ van der waals approach ) @xcite , with the lifshitz - zaremba - kohn theory for the nonlocal coulomb screening within the bulk @xcite .",
    "the average value of @xmath7 deduced from ccsd(t ) interaction energies between silver dimers at large distances is also provided in table  [ c6_coef ] @xcite .",
    "comparing new coefficients based on mp2 reference and standard ( d2 ) coefficients , one notices that the present qm : qm @xmath4 coefficients are substantially larger than those of the standard d2 model , with the differences for ag being more pronounced than for ir ( increase by 170 - 180% vs. 25 - 70 % ) .",
    "the two new @xmath34 coefficients are closer to each other than corresponding @xmath37 ones , hinting at the minor influence of ir coefficient on the approximation of @xmath38 differences for the case of silver .    here",
    ", one should take into account the possible deficiencies of mp2 for predicting binding energies .",
    "for example , for benzene molecule the @xmath4 coefficient evaluated by mp2 is overestimated by more than 40% @xcite .",
    "these overestimations could be even more pronounced for highly polarizable systems such as metal clusters and for periodic systems should lead to infinite @xmath4 coefficient because of vanishing bandgap .",
    "indeed , if we compare highly accurate @xmath4 values from table  [ c6_coef ] of ref .",
    "@xcite for the bulk silver within dft - vdwsurf approach which was obtained using the highly accurate experimental dielectric function of the ag bulk , our @xmath4 is about one magnitude higher .",
    "however , all our systems have non - vanishing bandgap even up to . for test cases ( see the supplementary material ) , mp2 overestimates binding energies by only 10 - 40 % if compared to ccsd .",
    "the orbital shift in mp2 leads to almost linear scaling of energy @xcite which indirectly evidences the absence of problems with the bandgap .",
    "nevertheless , if one compares the present results with ccsd(t ) for silver dimers , the @xmath4 coefficients obtain by mp2 are three times larger",
    ". summarizing , @xmath4 coefficients obtained by mp2 are likely to be overestimated , but one can state that for small systems they are larger than for the bulk metal .",
    "alternative to the mp2 reference we consider ri - rpa / def2-tzvp calculations . as noted",
    "before these have been performed for a smaller test set only , which did not include structures and cases with more than 10 ag atoms .",
    "separate fitting leads to a substantially different @xmath39 coefficient , which is even smaller ( by 28% ) than the corresponding standard d2 value , see table  [ c6_coef ] . in order to investigate this point",
    "further we performed a test calculation ( test1 in tab .",
    "[ c6_coef ] ) where the mp2 reference is taken for the same reduced set of structures .",
    "this yields a lowering of @xmath39 with respect to the full mp2 set , but still a notably higher value ( 13% ) as compared with rpa .    to scrutinize the large variability of @xmath37 further two additional fits",
    "have been performed .",
    "first , we fitted @xmath34 using all sets of test structures ( mp2 reference ) and assuming @xmath40  ev @xmath41 ( d2 model ) , and second , we applied the standard d2 @xmath42  =  255.69 and fitted @xmath43 only for the set of structures .",
    "the results are also shown in table  [ c6_coef ] ( entries  test2  ,  test3  ) . taking @xmath44",
    "ev @xmath45 leads to a slight increase of @xmath46 if compared to the `` simultaneous '' value , with the quality of fitting being practically the same .",
    "setting @xmath34 = 255.69 led to an enormously increased @xmath43 , with the rmsd increasing dramatically as well .",
    "this finding can be rationalized as follows : the ir atom is situated in the center of photosensitizer and hence screened by the ligands what hinders a direct interaction with the silver clusters .",
    "to cover the same amount of dispersion with the standard fixed value of @xmath34 is only possible with an extremely large coefficient for iridium .",
    "hence , it can be argued that the actual coefficients are extremely sensitive to the chemical environment , what in principle makes the simultaneous fit more reliable .    in the following applications we continue to consider two sets of coefficients : first the mp2 result obtained from simultaneous fitting ( pbe - d2 * ) .",
    "this includes the complete set of test structures which is not available for the most likely more accurate rpa .",
    "note , however , since no exact reference is available the judgement concerning accuracy of the two methods is solely based on results reported for other systems in literature",
    ". therefore mp2 derived results will be contrasted to rpa ones which are supplemented by the @xmath47 coefficient taken from the d2 model ( pbe - d2 * * ) .",
    ".[c6_coef ] values of @xmath48 and @xmath37 ( in @xmath49 ) fitted separately and simultaneously with the qm : qm method ( rmsd of @xmath50 in ev@xmath51 are given in parenthesis ) and from literature .",
    "for d3 value , the coefficients are only given for coordination numbers ( cn ) in parenthesis .",
    "for the meaning of tests see text . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      first , the obtained coefficients for ag and ir were verified for dissociation of two complexes : and .",
    "the optimized ( pbe / def2-sv(p ) ) geometries were frozen and distances between ir and closest ag atoms were changed .",
    "single point calculations of obtained structures were done using pbe ( pure and in different dispersion - included variants ) and mp2 with the def2-sv(p ) basis set .",
    "the dependencies of calculated binding energies on the ir - ag distance are plotted in fig .",
    "[ diss_curves ] .",
    "naturally , a very good agreement between mp2 and pbe - d2 * curves can be concluded for both complexes , with the d2 , d3 , and d2 * * lying in the middle of mp2-pbe gap .",
    "note that the minima of mp2 and dft - d2 * curves do not coincide since a larger basis set has been used for obtaining the c@xmath32 coefficients .",
    "rpa based results as well as coefficients themselves are lying between corresponding pbe - d2 and pbe - d3 curves , demonstrating slightly slower binding energies closer to dissociation limit .    as a second application",
    ", we evaluated the binding energy of the large nearly spherical silver cluster .",
    "the initial geometry of this cluster was cut from the fcc bulk silver and optimized with pbe / def2-sv(p ) separately .",
    "then the silver cluster was placed in the ppy - ppy cavity of the photosensitizer analogous to the smaller systems .",
    "the constructed complex was partially optimized using pbe - d2 * , i.e. only those silver atoms nearest to the irps and all atoms of irps were allowed to relax upon optimization .",
    "( note for the purposes of comparison , we also performed an optimization with pbe - d2 and pbe - d3 ; the changes in geometries are only minor ( up to 0.06  and 0.2 ) and can be neglected . )",
    "the resulting geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ irps - ag92 ] together with the corresponding binding energies per one silver atom calculated within different pbe - d models .",
    "the complex has no symmetry and the distance between central ir atom and nearest silver atom is 5.2 which is slightly higher than in the case of small silver clusters .",
    "due to steric reasons the large silver cluster can not come closer without significant distortions in its shape .",
    "the binding energy of the largest investigated system per one silver atom is very small and in the region of 0.0040.021 ev for all pbe - d variants .",
    "similar to the small systems , the account for dispersion forces increases the binding energy @xmath33 : from 0.004 ( pbe ) to 0.012 ( both pbe - d2 and pbe - d3 , pbe - d2 * * ) and to 0.021 ev ( for pbe - d2 * ) .",
    "the obtained value also confirms the decrease of @xmath33 per 1 silver atom with increasing system size .",
    "the trend can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ irps - ag92 ] where binding energies for selected examples of calculated with mp2 and all the pbe - d variants ( within def2-tzvp basis set ) are plotted . for clarity , only cases with the largest binding energies within mp2 are selected .",
    "finally , we apply the new coefficients to derivatives of irps . although our coefficients are by construction suited for the particular photosensitizer with ppy and bpy ligands ( isolated or located around ir central atom ) we wanted to scrutinise the sensitivity with respect to the type of heteroatom . for this reason we investigated the binding between and cluster an a photosensitizers containing oxygen ( ) and sulphur ( ) in the ligands .",
    "the structures of optimized complexes are depicted in fig .",
    "[ derivatives ] and they are overall similar to those of irps . again the silver cluster is located in the cavities between the two ligands , with the distance between the central ir atom and the nearest silver atom being about 4.84.9 .",
    "the binding energies are about 1.4 ev ( or 0.14 ev per one silver atom ) for both cases , which is only slightly lower than those of and corresponds again to a weak interaction ( physisorption ) .",
    "the interaction of ir(iii ) photosensitizers containing ppy and bpy ligands with small silver clusters ag@xmath2 ( @xmath3=220 ) is studied using dispersion - corrected density functional theory together with the rpa and mp2 methods .",
    "the goal has been to develop a system - specific set of @xmath4 parameters for ir and ag atoms in the spirit of the d2 correction . to this end the qm : qm scheme was employed for a set of model structures .",
    "an important aspect for this particular type of system is that the ir atom is shielded by the ligands . as a consequence the ir parameters turn out to be rather sensitive to the actual method of fitting , whereas the ag coefficients are more robust .    in general binding of silver clusters",
    "to irps is weak and in the physisorption range .",
    "the binding energy per silver atom decreases with the size of the cluster to become as small as 0.010.02 ev for the largest cluster studied ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "although our new coefficients are by construction suited for the particular example of interaction of silver clusters with organic or metalorganic molecules containing ppy and bpy ligands , the transferability of new @xmath4 coefficients for similar systems was shown using the exemplary cases of irps containing o and s heteroatoms .    in order to derive @xmath4 two references",

    "it was found that mp2 did not give convergence and bandgap - related problems , most likely since the considered metal clusters still have molecular character and can be described with respective orbitals .",
    "however , based on reports in literature one would expect that rpa is more reliable for the description of binding in these weakly bound organic / inorganic hybrid systems .",
    "therefore , the @xmath34 value obtained on the rpa level should be considered as being more accurate compared to mp2 .",
    "this value turns out to be close to the ones of the grimme d2/d3 sets .",
    "however , this similarity should be taken with care . in view of the fact that the polarizability is determined by a non - local response kernel ,",
    "the reduction to a single coefficient for an arbitrary arrangement of atoms is quite an approximation . as an additional caveat we should mention that , of course , extraction of dispersion coefficients in the present qm : qm scheme assumes that other contributions to the interaction do not differ between the qm methods",
