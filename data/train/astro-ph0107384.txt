    "one of the challenges in the analysis of 1d spectra , 2d images or 3d volumes in astrophysics and cosmology is to overcome the problem of separating a localized signal from a background . in particular , we are interested in localized sources with central symmetry and a background that we shall assume with the properties of homogeneity and isotropy and it will be characterized by a power spectrum .",
    "typical cases in the 1d case include : a ) the spectra of qsos , how to detect / extract absorption lines from a noisy spectrum once a profile is assumed , b ) time series analysis where a localized emission is superposed on a background , c ) point and extended sources to be detected in time - ordered data where the scanning strategy ( for satellites like planck ) is affected by the well - known @xmath0 noise . in the 2d case , we mention as typical cases : a ) cleaning of images to detect typical astrophysical sources on a white noise background , b ) the detection / extraction of point sources and extended sources ( clusters of galaxies ) on microwave / ir maps where the background is dominated by white noise or intrinsic cmb signal or galactic emission . in the 3d case , we remark as an example :",
    "a ) the detection of clusters and large - scale structure in 3d catalogs .    the classical treatment to remove the background has been _ filtering_. low and high - pass filters reduced the contribution from the high and low frequencies present in the spectrum or image . in general , this process is extremely inefficient in dealing with very localized sources .",
    "the reason for that is that a very localized source can be decomposed in fourier space but many waves are needed ( infinite for a delta distribution ! ) , so if low / high - pass filters are applied then at the end many artefacts ( rings in 2d images ) usually appear surrounding the sources .",
    "a very important application of these principles is the detection of sources in two - dimensional astronomical images .",
    "several packages are commonly used for this task , such as daofind ( stetson 1992 ) , used to find stellar objects in astronomical images , and sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . when trying to detect sources , two different problems have to be solved : first , it is necessary to take account for the background variations across the image .",
    "in addition , if instrumental noise ( i. e. white noise ) appears , it should be removed as far as possible in order to increase the snr ratio .",
    "sextractor estimates the local background on a grid of size set by the user and then approximates it by a low - order polynomial .",
    "once such a background is defined the detection of sources at a certain level can be established through sets of connected pixels above certain threshold .",
    "daofind implicitly assumes that the background is smooth and its characteristic scale is very much larger than the scale of the stars .",
    "but in the case where the characteristic scale of variation of the background is approximately the scale of the structures the previous schemes obviously fail .",
    "an incorrect estimation of the background leads to a biased estimation of the amplitude of the sources .",
    "an example is a typical image of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) at a resolution of several arcmin .",
    "if the intrinsic signal is due to a cold dark matter model ( i. e. the characteristic scale of the background is of the order of @xmath1 arcmin ) , then the separation of point sources with the same characteristic scale becomes a very difficult task .",
    "to deal with the instrumental noise the traditional procedure is filtering ( e. g. gaussian window ) .",
    "daofind filters with an elliptical gaussian that mimics the stellar psf and then it performs the detection looking for peaks above certain threshold .",
    "sextractor includes the possibility of filtering with several kind of filters ( top hat , gaussian , mexican hat and even self - made filters for every particular situation ) .",
    "an obvious advantage of this procedures ( background estimation plus filtering ) is that no a priori information on the structures is needed .",
    "a serious drawback is that the choice of the filter will have a great influence on the final result .",
    "the choice of filter depends on many factors , including in most cases personal preferences .    in this context , it is necessary to find a systematic way to determine the optimal filter for every case .",
    "other methods have been used to separate different components given several microwave maps : wiener filtering ( wf ) and maximum entropy methods ( mem ) . regarding point sources",
    ", wf assumes a mean spectral flux dependence together with other assumptions for the other components ( tegmark & efstathiou , 1996 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1999 ) whereas mem assumes that the point sources are distributed like noise ( hobson et al .",
    "these methods are powerful regarding extended sources like clusters of galaxies because they use the concrete spectral dependence for the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "it is clear that the unknown spectral dependence for point sources remark the inefficiency of the previous methods .    a possible solution to overcome this problem came with the usage of _ wavelets_. these are localized bases that allow a representation of a local object due , in general , to their basic properties : spatial and frequency localization ( as opposed to the trigonometric functions appearing in fourier decomposition ) .",
    "we remark at this point the success of such a technique dealing with simulated microwave maps : the `` mexican hat '' wavelet can be used in a nice way ( no extra assumptions about the background ) to detect / extract point sources and create a simulated catalog ( cayn et al .",
    "2000 , vielva et al . 2000 ) .",
    "two advantages emerge : on the one hand , one localizes the structures associated to the maxima of the wavelet coefficients and , what is more remarkable , we gain in the detection ( as compared to real space ) due to the amplification effect because at the scale of the source the background is not contributing to the dispersion .",
    "one relevant question concerns the possibility to find _ optimal _ filters .",
    "tegmark & oliveira - costa ( 1998 ) introduced a filter that minimizes the variance in the map . with this method",
    "one can identify a big number of point sources in cmb maps .",
    "however , they failed to introduce the appropriate constraints in the minimization problem , i. e. the fact that we have a maximum at the source position at the scale defined by the source in order not to have spurious identifications .",
    "thus , this type of analysis lead us to the following questions : is there an optimal filter ( or better pseudo - filter ) given the source profile and the power spectrum of the background ?",
    ", is the `` mexican hat '' wavelet the optimal pseudo - filter dealing with point sources ? in order to answer these questions , we will assume that the sources can be approximated by structures with central symmetry given by a profile @xmath2 , @xmath3 with a characteristic scale ( e.g. a single maximum at its center and rapid decay at large distances ) .",
    "if the nd image contains different types of sources , a number of pseudo - filters adapted to each profile must be used to detect them . a possible generalization to include more general profiles is under study .",
    "the background will be modelled by a homogeneous and isotropic random field given in terms of the power spectrum @xmath4 , @xmath5 . in particular",
    ", we shall explore a scale - free spectrum @xmath6 that includes the cases of white noise ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath0 noise ( @xmath8 ) , etc .",
    "moreover , any spectrum of physical interest often can be locally approximated by a power - law .",
    "if the characteristics of the noise are not known a priori it can be always estimated directly from the nd image .",
    "we consider the n - dimensional case and make special emphasis on the analysis of spectra ( @xmath9 ) , 2d images ( @xmath10 ) and 3d volumes ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in all the calculations we assume that the overlapping by nearby sources is negligible and also that their contribution to the total power spectrum is also negligible .",
    "all of this is a very good approximation at least above a certain flux level .",
    "an analytical approach to get the optimal pseudo - filter is presented in section  [ optfilter ] .",
    "section  [ realspace ] deals with properties of the optimal pseudo - filters on real space .",
    "section  [ detection ] introduces the concepts of detection level and gain .",

    "conclusions are summarized in section  [ conclusions ] .",

    "the large - scale fluctuations are also removed as well as the small - scale noise , as in the case of the optimal pseudo - filter .",
    "nonetheless , the gain is lower and only three of the sources reach the @xmath151 level .",
    "additionally , it is found that the small - scale noise removal is less efficient in the case of the mexican hat .",
    "the optimal pseudo - filter gives the position and an unbiased estimator of the amplitude of the source .",
    "we propose to make the extraction of the source on real space , i. e. one subtracts the function @xmath160 , being @xmath161 the given profile and @xmath146 the estimated amplitude , at the position of the source @xmath162 .    from the practical point of view , in order to select the appropriate sources ( with a given scale and avoiding to select spurious detections if the background and/or noise are manifest at scales comparable to the sources ) we can operate with the optimal pseudo - filter at other different scales @xmath30 as given by equation ( 10 ) but with @xmath163 . if the scale that gives the maximum do not correspond to the scale we are looking for",
    "then this is a spurious source ( or another type of source with a different scale ) . as an additional check",
    ", we can calculate the source profile in the pseudo - filter space nearby any real source , e. g. for a gaussian profile the behaviour around the maximum @xmath164 must be    @xmath165,\\ \\   x\\equiv \\frac{r}{r_o},\\ \\ \\",
    "m\\equiv \\frac{n + \\gamma } { 2},\\ ] ]    and an analogous behaviour can be found for the exponential profile .",
    "if a detected source do not follows such a behaviour then it would be consider as a false detection and must be deleted from the initial catalog .",
    "we have introduced for the first time ( as far as the authors know ) the concept of _ optimal _ pseudo - filter to detect / extract spherical sources on a background modelled by a ( homogeneous & isotropic ) random field characterized by its power spectrum .",
    "we have obtained a generic analytical formula that allows to calculate such a pseudo - filter either in fourier or real space as a function of the source profile and power spectrum of the background .",
    "the psesudofilter is an unbiased an efficient estimator of the amplitude of the sources .",
    "we have applied the previous formula to the cases of a gaussian and an exponential profile and studied scale - free spectra . in particular , we have remarked the interesting cases of white noise and @xmath0 noise .",
    "we have calculated the detection level for the physically interesting cases of spectra , images and volumes .",
    "for some particular cases , the optimal pseudo - filters are wavelets ( e. g. a gaussian source embedded in white noise in the 2d case )",
    ".    we have simulated gaussian sources embedded in a @xmath0 noise in order to see the performance of the optimal filter against the mexican hat wavelet . in the last case",
    "the gain is lower , the noise removal is less efficient and the number of real detections is smaller .",
    "we also remark that filtering with a gaussian window is not the optimal procedure .",
    "the extraction of the sources identified at a certain scale is proposed to be done directly on real space . at the location of the source",
    "@xmath162 one subtracts the function @xmath160 , being @xmath161 the given profile .",
    "all the calculations assume that the overlapping of nearby sources is negligible and the contribution of the sources to the background is also negligible .",
    "this is a very good approximation in many cases of interest at least above a certain flux level .",
    "we remark the advantages of our method over traditional ones ( daofind , sextractor ) : we do not need to assume a smooth background and/or some filters ( e.g. gaussian ) in order to detect the sources . for some astrophysical cases ( cmb ) the background can be complex so a smooth surface could be not a reasonable assumption .",
    "however , we need to assume the profile of the source and statistical properties of the background in order to get the optimal filter .",
    "the main advantage of our method is the amplification effect ( gain ) going to pseudo - filter space .",
    "generalization of these studies , considering different kind of sources ( including non - centrally symmetric ones ) , are now being undertaken .",
    "the applications of this type of methodology is without any doubt of interest not only for astrophysics / cosmology but for other sciences .",
