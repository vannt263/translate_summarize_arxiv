    "the maximal @xmath13 amplitude of about 0.15 occurs at @xmath157  ev@xmath4 .",
    "these @xmath155 oscillations could be observed by long - baseline neutrino experiments with proposed high intensity muon sources  @xcite , which can also make precise measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath78 oscillations .",
    "sensitivity to @xmath158 is expected  @xcite for the parameter ranges of interest here ; matter effects would not be large for an experiment from fermilab to soudan  @xcite . for @xmath159  ev@xmath4",
    ", @xmath57 could be measured down to @xmath160 ; the expected sensitivity versus @xmath7 is shown in fig .",
    "precise measurement of @xmath155 and @xmath12 oscillations in such a long - baseline experiment would uniquely specify the @xmath27-conserving part of the three - neutrino model .      in this section",
    "we discuss how future solar neutrino measurements can distinguish between the different solar vacuum oscillation solutions .",
    "we consider only the two - neutrino solutions since the discussion easily generalizes to the three - neutrino case",
    ".    one interesting feature of vacuum long - wavelength solutions is that they can give a rise in the fraction of surviving @xmath6 s for higher electron energies , in agreement with the superk measurement  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ spectrum ] shows the ratio of the electron energy spectrum to the ssm prediction for two different vacuum long - wavelength scenarios and the superk data .",
    "future measurements at superk will improve the statistics in the high @xmath101 bins .",
    "however , with an @xmath161 flux that is @xmath162 times greater than the ssm result , this rise at high @xmath101 could be due to contributions of @xmath161 neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "superk is also planning to lower their threshhold for electron detection to 5  mev ; this is particularly important since the number of events rises for energies just below the current threshhold of 6.5  mev . in fig .",
    "[ lowe ] we show predictions for the electron energy spectrum in superk in the range 5  mev  @xmath163  10  mev for the four oscillation solutions a , b , c , and d in table  [ sunfits ] .",
    "it is evident that solutions a and b may be distinguishable from c and d , and from each other , using data at lower @xmath101 . the energy spectrum measured in the sno experiment  @xcite will also provide additional information on the energy dependence of the spectrum suppression .",
    "another feature of vacuum solar solutions is that they may cause a detectable seasonal variation as the distance between the earth and sun varies  @xcite .",
    "we define two seasonal asymmetry parameters , a_1 & = & 2(n_w - n_s ) ( n_w + n_s + n_f + n_sp ) , [ asy1 ] + a_2 & = & n_w + n_s - n_f - n_sp n_w + n_s + n_f + n_sp , [ asy2 ] where @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 are the number of events collected in the time periods from november 20 to february 19 ( winter , earth closest to the sun ) , february 20 to may 21 ( spring ) , may 22 to august 20 ( summer , earth farthest from the sun ) , and august 21 to november 19 ( fall ) , respectively . since @xmath168 (",
    "the same range of distances is covered ) , @xmath169 and @xmath170 are the only independent quantities that may be constructed from the four seasonal measurements .",
    "the quantity @xmath169 is similar to the seasonal asymmetry defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath169 and @xmath170 are similar to the first two harmonics in the analysis of the first paper in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath169 has a significant nonzero value when the oscillation probability increases or decreases monotonically as the earth moves from perihelion to aphelion , while @xmath170 has a significant nonzero value when the oscillation probability reaches a local extremum somewhere between perihelion and aphelion . due to the @xmath171 dependence of the solar neutrino flux and the 3.3% change in @xmath172 from perihelion to aphelion , @xmath169 and",
    "@xmath170 have the values 0.030 and 0 , respectively , in the absence of oscillations .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath169 is strongly correlated with the electron energy spectrum distortion ; such a correlation is a distinctive characteristic of vacuum oscillations  @xcite .    for @xmath95b neutrinos , due to their relatively higher energies and longer oscillation wavelengths ,",
    "the seasonal variation is less pronounced than for solar neutrinos of lower energy .",
    "the total superk event rate as a fraction of the ssm value versus time of year  @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ skseas ] ; also shown is the prediction for solution  a in table  [ sunfits ] and the prediction for no oscillations .",
    "the results for other oscillation solutions are similar to the prediction for solution  a. oscillation solutions produce an enhanced seasonal effect  @xcite .",
    "the superk experiment has not observed a significant seasonal variation with the current data sample , but could be sensitive to the effects predicted by vacuum oscillations with increased statistics .    in order to extract the most information from the superk data it is advantageous to plot the seasonal asymmetries versus the observed electron energy . in fig .",
    "[ superkseas ] we show @xmath169 versus @xmath101 for solutions  a , b , c , and d of table  [ sunfits ] .",
    "although the asymmetries are not large , each solution has a characteristic shape , especially solution  a. the energy dependence of @xmath169 clearly distinguishes the oscillation scenarios from the asymmetry induced only by the seasonal flux variation .",
    "similar measurements can be done in the sno experiment  @xcite .",
    "the deviation of @xmath170 from the value for no oscillations is at most about 0.003 , and does not provide a good discrimination between models .    the gallex and sage @xmath0ga experiments may also exhibit a seasonal variation with increased statistics if there are vacuum oscillations of solar neutrinos  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ a1a2ga ] we plot the predictions for @xmath170 versus @xmath169 in the gallex and sage experiments for a range of @xmath117 from each of the four `` finger '' regions in fig .",
    "[ 2nusun ] .",
    "most of the seasonal asymmetry in the @xmath0ga experiments is due to the monoenergetic @xmath173be neutrinos which constitute about 25% of the signal in the ssm .",
    "the borexino experiment  @xcite will primarily measure the @xmath173be neutrinos ( @xmath174 mev ) using the process @xmath175 .",
    "the final - state electron kinetic energy @xmath176 has a maximum value of 0.665  mev for @xmath173be neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath177 neutrinos have a maximum @xmath176 of 0.26  mev , and also there is a considerable background for @xmath178  mev .",
    "therefore selecting events in the range @xmath179  mev will preferentially select the @xmath173be neutrino signal .",
    "neutrinos from the @xmath180 reaction and the cno cycle will also give final - state electrons in this energy range , but the @xmath173be neutrinos represent more than 80% of the signal , assuming the ssm .",
    "predictions for event rate and seasonal variation in the borexino experiment for various vacuum oscillation parameters have previously been discussed in the literature  @xcite . here",
    "we examine how the seasonal asymmetries in eqs .",
    "( [ asy1 ] ) and ( [ asy2 ] ) may be used to further discriminate the different vacuum neutrino solutions in table  [ sunfits ] . in fig .",

    "[ 2nusun ] .",
    "the seasonal asymmetries are potentially larger than in the @xmath0ga case since the @xmath173be neutrinos are a much larger fraction of the signal .",
    "although there are some regions where the predictions of two or more solutions overlap , combining the asymmetry information with the event rate should significantly reduce the allowed parameter regions for the vacuum solutions , and could select the appropriate `` finger '' region .",
