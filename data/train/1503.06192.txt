    "this system has been extensively studied from x - ray to sub - mm wavelengths @xcite .",
    "radio interferometric imaging of the v4046 sgr disk in co emission reveals that the circumbinary molecular disk is inclined at 33.5@xmath5 @xcite and extends to @xmath0350 au @xcite , with an estimated total gas+dust mass of @xmath00.1 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "such a large and massive disk is unexpected , given that the v4046 sgr system is a factor @xmath010 older than the vast majority of known , actively accreting stars with circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "early science coronagraphic / polarimetric images of v4046 sgr were obtained with gemini / gpi through j ( 1.24 @xmath7 m ) and k2 ( 2.27 @xmath7 m ) band filters and 0.184 and 0.306@xmath8 diameter coronagraphic spots on april 23 and 24 , 2014 , respectively .",

    "exposures of 60 s were initially attempted in the j band , but saturated the detector .",
    "this saturation may have been due to a slight mispointing , causing starlight to leak out the west side of the coronagraph and saturate the detector .",
    "although gpi s extreme adaptive optics delivers very low total wavefront error , vibrations from the cryocoolers and a small fixed focus offset between the coronagraph focal plane mask and the science focal plane degraded the angular resolution of early science data to @xmath9 ( @xmath0 3 au ) at j band . at the time of observation , v4046 sgr ( m@xmath10= 9.11 mag ) was the faintest target successfully observed with gpi and hence served as a test of the useful domain of the gpi instrument in coronagraphic / polarimetric mode .",
    "images in each filter were reduced and combined using the gpi pipeline v1.2.1 @xcite , following methods similar to those outlined in @xcite .",

    "satellite spots on each j - band image were used to determine the location of the ( unresolved ) binary star behind the coronagraph .",
    "the binary was insufficiently bright in the k2 images for accurate determination of its location behind the occulting spot via this technique , so its location was assumed to be at the center of the apparent coronagraph spot in each image . to avoid positive bias in the polarized intensity image ,",
    "the radial and tangential stokes parameters p@xmath11 and p@xmath12 @xcite were computed via the pipeline ; we assume that all polarized flux is in the tangential component . procedures for subtraction of the total intensity psf for extended objects in gpi s polarization mode are still under development .",

    "such particle growth and migration processes are expected to accompany an epoch of giant planet formation .",
    "specifically , theories of giant planet formation in dusty disks with embedded , nascent planets predict the generation of radially localized pressure maxima as a consequence of planet - disk dynamical interactions @xcite .",
    "these pressure gradients trap larger ( mm- to cm - sized ) particles outside the planet - forming regions of the disk , whereas smaller ( micron - sized ) grains freely pass through the pressure traps , resulting in strong dust particle size gradients .",
    "interferometric imaging of dusty protoplanetary disks often reveal central disk clearings whose inner radii are significantly larger than the orbits of the jovian planets in our solar system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this dichotomy in disk size scales has left open the potential connection between inner disk clearings and giant planet building .",
    "modeling by @xcite shows that pressure bumps in the disk due to gaps opened by orbiting planets trap mm - sized dust grains into a ring that may be located at radii greater than twice a planet s orbital radius , depending on the mass of the planet .",
    "smaller ( @xmath24m - sized ) dust particles drift inward and create a ring between the planet - induced gap and the mm dust ring .",
    "such an interpretation has been applied to mm - wave and near - ir imaging of the disk orbiting the intermediate - mass star sao 206462 @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness profile from near - infrared scattered light off the disk around sao 206462 shows a similar power law dependence on scales about twice that determined here for v4046 sgr , despite the fact that the sao 206462 disk exhibits spiral structure , rather than rings , and the scattered light lies exterior to the sub - mm hole .",
    "thus , the dust ring structure and radial profiles seen in both v4046 sgr and sao 206462 suggest that dust segregation and planet formation may be occurring within these disks .",
    "it is possible that the depletion in scattered light at r@xmath2 14 au in our gpi images may be due to giant planet formation .",
    "this cavity can not be due purely to dynamical effects from the binary system , as the tight ( @xmath09 @xmath4 ) binary can only truncate the disk out to @xmath00.135 au .",
    "although this cavity could conceivably be filled by a geometrically thin disk surface that happens to lie roughly parallel to the paths of incoming photons from the central stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we regard such an ( _ ad hoc _ ) inner disk geometry as less likely than that of an opening carved out by a giant planet .",
    "it is also possible , but unlikely , that photoevaporation has caused this depletion of dust within @xmath014 au , since models predict that micron - sized dust is rapidly destroyed by x - ray / uv radiation @xcite , and the gpi images demonstrate that a significant mass of micron - sized dust is still present at disk radii between 14 to 45 au after @xmath020 myr of disk evolution .    @xcite model the effects of giant planets in massive , dusty disks on the appearance of gaps in scattered light images .",
    "they find that the formation of a giant planet results in a deficit of 1.3 mm emission at the location of the forming planet for disks more massive than 2.67@xmath2510@xmath26 m@xmath27 .",
    "gaps in near - infrared scattered light are also evident for lower mass disks , but for massive disks ( m @xmath282.67@xmath2510@xmath26 m@xmath27 ) the disk remains optically thick and thus a gap may not be apparent in scattered light at near - infrared wavelengths . while the v4046 sgr disk is massive overall ( m@xmath00.1m@xmath27 ) , modeling of the disk dust distribution @xcite , and the evidence for dust segregation by size , suggests most of the dust mass resides beyond the @xmath029 au sub - mm  edge \" , thereby allowing for gaps formed by giant planets to be visible in scattered light images at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "these models suggest that planets may be forming interior to @xmath014 au and possibly near the r@xmath020 au break between the rings seen in scattered light ( figs .",
    "considering the depletion of sub - mm emission interior to @xmath029 au @xcite , a giant planet at @xmath020 au would also be consistent with modeling predicting that sub - mm rings form at @xmath281.5 times the planets orbital radius @xcite .",
    "simulations of planet formation in circumstellar disks by @xcite further support the idea that planet formation is occurring in the v4046 sgr disk .",
    "these models show that jupiter - mass planets can clear large visible gaps in @xmath7 m and mm wavelengths at the locations of forming planets .",
    "planets interior to a sub - mm cavity can form multiple dust rings and gaps depending on the planet s size and location , just as we observe in our gpi images of v4046 sgr ( compare our figs . 1 and 3 with their figs . 2,5 and 7 ) .",
    "overall , our gpi imaging of the v4046 sgr disk hence provides vivid evidence in support of so - called `` dust filtration '' models describing the structure of protoplanetary disks following giant planet formation .",
    "gpi coronagraphic / polarimetric imaging of the v4046 sgr ab circumbinary disk , combined with mm imaging , demonstrates dust segregation by size into rings , which may be caused by multiple young giant planets orbiting the v4046 sgr ab binary system at orbital semimajor axes similar to those of the giant planets in our solar system .",
    "polarized intensity images yield evidence that the disk is well populated by relatively small ( micron - sized or smaller ) grains within its central , @xmath029 au large - grain cavity and , furthermore , that there exists an interior @xmath214 au - radius region that is devoid even of small grains . comparison with models of protoplanet - disk interactions @xcite suggests that gas giant planets may be present , and actively carving gaps , at r@xmath214 au and at r@xmath020 au in the v4046 sgr disk .",
    "further imaging with gemini / gpi or similar instrumentation at higher signal to noise , as well as high resolution imaging with alma , is necessary to better discern the structure of the rings evident around v4046 sgr .",
    "modeling is also needed to determine the grain properties and dust mass within the disk , along with the location of possible forming planets .",
