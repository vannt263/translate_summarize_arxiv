    "p2p live streaming applications like p2p iptv are emerging on the internet and will be massively used in the future",
    ". the p2p traffic counts already for a large part of the internet traffic and this is mainly due to p2p file - sharing applications as bittorrent  @xcite or edonkey  @xcite .",
    "video streaming services like youtube  @xcite appeared only a few months ago but contribute already to an important part of the internet traffic .",
    "it is expected that p2p iptv will largely contribute to increase the overall internet traffic .",
    "it is therefore important to study p2p iptv traffic and to characterize its properties .",
    "+ the characterization of p2p iptv traffic will allow us to understand its impact on the network .",
    "p2p iptv applications have stringent qos constraints ( e.g. bandwidth , delay , jitter ) and their traffic characterization will enable to understand their exact needs in network resources .",
    "the knowledge of the traffic properties enables the development of synthetic traffic generation models that are key input parameters when modeling or simulating these systems .",
    "indeed , the modeling or simulating steps are necessary to design judiciously applications . from a traffic engineering point of view",
    ", well understanding p2p iptv traffic is essential for internet service providers to forecast their internal traffic and ensure a good provisioning of their network . and",
    "last but not least , global knowledge of the traffic properties will highlight some drawbacks of the applications and will make it possible to improve the design of new p2p iptv architectures .",
    "for instance , an important concern of these systems is the scalability .",
    "the traffic characterization may help estimate the impact of overhead traffic generated by the signaling .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a multiscale analysis of the structure of the traffic generated by the most popular p2p iptv applications , namely pplive  @xcite , ppstream  @xcite , sopcast  @xcite and tvants  @xcite .",
    "+ during the 2006 fifa world cup , we performed an extensive measurement campaign .",
    "we measured the network traffic generated by broadcasting soccer games by the previously mentioned applications .",
    "the multiscale behavior of the collected traffic is analyzed using a wavelet transform based tool . in this paper",
    ", we characterize the network traffic of p2p iptv systems at different time scales and compare their properties .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that does a comparative multiscale characterization of p2p iptv traffic .",
    "+ our multiscale p2p iptv traffic analysis shows significant differences in the scaling behaviors of tcp and udp traffic .",
    "the tcp traffic presents periodic behavior while the udp traffic is stationary and presents long - range dependency characteristics , which will affect the quality of the video reception .",
    "the signaling traffic has an impact on the download traffic but it has negligible impact on the upload traffic .",
    "the upload traffic generated by p2p iptv systems have different scaling characteristics compare to the download traffic and both sides of the traffic has to be taken into account to design judiciously p2p iptv traffic models .",
    "moreover , the traffic granularity has to be considered while using traffic models to simulate these systems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , we present the related work in section  [ sec : related ] . in section  [ sec : experiments ] , we give an overview of the measured applications and describe our measurement experiment setup . in section  [ sec : metho ] , we present our methodology to analyze the traffic at different time scales .",
    "we present our p2p iptv traffic analysis in section  [ sec : results ] and discuss the results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper and give perspectives in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "nowadays , an increasing number of p2p iptv measurement studies is conducted to analyze the mechanisms of such systems .",
    "+ zhang  et .  al  @xcite present the first measurement results about their protocol donet  @xcite , which were deployed on the internet and called coolstreaming .",
    "they provide network statistics , like user s behavior in the whole system and the quality of video reception .",
    "+ hei  et al .",
    "@xcite  @xcite made a complete measurement of the popular pplive application .",
    "they made active measurements by instrumentalizing their own crawler and give many architecture and overlay details like buffer size or number of peers in the networks .",
    "vu  et al .",
    "@xcite made also active measurements of the pplive system and derive mathematical models for the distributions of channel population size or session length .",
    "+ in our previous work  @xcite , we passively measured the network traffic generated by several popular applications during a worldwide event .",
    "we compared the measured applications by inferring their underlying mechanisms and highlight their design differences and similarities .",
    "ali  et al .",
    "@xcite made passive measurements of pplive and sopcast applications and analyze the performance and characteristics of such systems .",
    "+ still in their previously mentioned works , ali  et al . provide their own methodology to study the data exchanges of such p2p applications . based on their measurement studies , hei  et al .",
    "@xcite developed also a methodology to estimate the overall perceived video quality throughout the network .",
    "+ all these works studied p2p iptv systems by measuring the traffic and tried to infer their mechanisms , but they did not characterize the correlation structure of the generated traffic at different time scales to understand its properties and its impact on the network .",
    "for our p2p iptv traffic measurement experiments , we chose four applications , namely pplive , ppstream , sopcast and tvants because they were very popular on the internet . whenever these applications are freely available , their source codes are not open and their exact implementation details and used protocols are still widely unknown .",
    "we can only rely on reverse engineering to understand their transmission mechanisms .",
    "+ all these applications claim to use swarming protocol like donet . similarly to bittorrent , video data flows are divided into data chunks and each peer downloads the chunck of data to other peers concurrently .",
    "the peers know how to download the video data chunks by exchanging randomly with other peers information about the data chunks they have or neighbor peers they know . with this signaling traffic",
    ", each peer discovers iteratively new peers , new available data chunks and is able to download video from several peers . in these p2p protocols ,",
    "there are two kinds of traffic : video traffic where peers exchange data chunks with each other and signaling traffic where peers exchange information to get the data .",
    "+ as we show in  @xcite , all the applications transport video and signaling traffics differently : ppstream uses exclusively tcp for all traffics while pplive adds udp for some signaling traffic .",
    "sopcast uses almost entirely udp and tvants is more balanced between tcp ( @xmath0 75% ) and udp for all kinds of traffic .",
    "+ in the next section , we will present the measurement experiments platform we used to collect the p2p iptv traffic .",
    ".packet traces summary [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we already show in  @xcite that all the applications do not implement the same mechanisms to download the video .",
    "according to the applications , the video can be received from only a few provider peers at the same time or from many peers and the video peers session durations are various .",
    "this explains why the amount of data transported by the top flows are different for all the applications .",
    "+ the top download flows sent by the top peer to our nodes will be analyzed by using wavelet based transform method with ldestimate , similarly to the previous experiments .",
    "due to space limitation , we only present on fig .",
    "[ fig : topflows ] , the energy spectra for a single tcp application ( pplive fig  [ subfig : pplive_flow ] and [ subfig : pplive_flow_video ] ) and for udp application ( sopcast fig .",
    "[ subfig : sopcast_flow ] and [ subfig : sopcast_flow_video ] ) .",
    "the other tcp applications plots are similar to the presented tcp application and can be found in the appendix .",
    "+ we notice for the two applications that their video energy spectra look similar to their overall energy spectra .",
    "this was expected because these flows are sent by the top contributor peers and transport almost entirely video packets and not signaling packets .",
    "removing signaling traffic on these flows can only have a limited impact , depending on the signaling packets in the flows .",
    "+ for example , the top download flow of sopcast transport 15,867 packets of signaling traffic ( @xmath1 ) counting for 2.71  mbytes whereas pplive top download flow transport only 5,731 signaling packets ( @xmath2 ) counting for 0.33  mbytes . + regarding tcp applications fig .",
    "[ subfig : pplive_flow ] and [ subfig : pplive_flow_video ] , until time scale @xmath3 , the energy spectra of the top flow look similar to the aggregate traffic . beyond this time scale ,",
    "the energy spectra of the top download flow are different from the aggregate traffic because the energy spectra of the top flow are increasing .",
    "+ with udp applications , until time scale @xmath4 , the energy spectra of the top flow are different from the aggregate traffic . fig .",
    "[ subfig : sopcast_flow ] and [ subfig : sopcast_flow_video ] show an energy bump at time scale @xmath5 , then the energy spectra increase slightly from @xmath6 to @xmath4 . beyond @xmath4",
    ", we observe the linear increase usually observed for the udp energy spectra .    in this experiment",
    ", we observe that the top flows in the download traffic do not have the same scaling properties as the aggregate download traffic .",
    "we did the same experiments for the 10th top download flows ( i.e. the 10th flow according to data volume transported ) .",
    "the 10th top flows present the same scaling properties as the top flows .",
    "the plots for the 10th top flows can be shown in the appendix .",
    "+ the aggregate traffic is not only the mix of every single flow .",
    "the granularity of the p2p iptv traffic has to be taken into account when designing p2p iptv traffic models .",
    "in this work , we analyzed the p2p iptv traffic by using a wavelet based transform method .",
    "this allows us to characterize this traffic and to understand its properties and impact on the network .",
    "thanks to our original p2p iptv traffic analysis , we have many new findings and observations that have to be summarized and discussed . + first of all , we observed that the energy spectra of tcp applications are different from the energy spectra of udp applications ( section  [ sec : versus ] ) .",
    "one of the most relevant difference is the energy bump observed in the spectra of tcp applications at time scale @xmath7 ( 5.12s ) , which indicates a possible periodic behavior in the traffic . intuitively , we could believe these differences come from the two different transport protocols used",
    ". however , a 5 seconds periodic behaviors is a very long duration for tcp mechanisms and tcp should not be the responsible of this periodic behavior . with a simple application design difference",
    ", the scaling properties of the generated traffic do not have the same impact on the network .",
    "+ secondly , for all the applications , the signaling traffic represents a larger part in the download traffic than the upload traffic ( section  [ subsec : signaling ] ) . the signaling traffic has clearly an impact on the scaling properties of the download traffic and has no impact on the upload traffic .",
    "this observation is important since signaling traffic is necessary to coordinate the data exchanges in such p2p systems . for scalability reasons , the amount of signaling traffic has to be kept as low as possible .",
    "the download signaling traffic comes from other peers on the internet that request the video data .",
    "efforts have to be made to reduce the number of packets sent by the signaling protocol to get the video data and to preserve the scalability of these systems in the network .",
    "+ then , the previous observation highlights an important point when modeling p2p iptv traffic : the download traffic has not the same properties as the upload traffic .",
    "the differences between both sides of the traffic ( i.e. upload and download ) have to be taken into account carefully when designing synthetic traffic generation models .",
    "+ the generated traffic of tcp applications is not stationary beyond time scale @xmath3 . on the contrary ,",
    "the traffic of udp applications is stationary .",
    "as shown in section  [ subsec : stationarity ] , the stationnarity experiment proves that the signaling traffic of udp application involves long - range dependency in the download traffic .",
    "the udp application experiments also long - range dependency in the upload traffic . in presence of traffic lrd",
    ", the network conditions are always changing and it becomes a hard task to provide qos parameters as delay for users to get good quality video .",
    "+ this finding highlights the not so trivial choice of transport protocols for p2p iptv traffic .",
    "it is usually admitted that the non - elastic data transfer -as video- has to rely on udp but we show that udp traffic may lead to trouble in the network traffic . + finally , the aggregate download traffic of p2p iptv systems has not exactly the same scaling properties as the top download flow ( section  [ sec : topdl ] ) .",
    "the granularity of the traffic has to be taken into account when designing p2p iptv traffic models .",
    "a p2p iptv traffic model based only on flows properties would fail to capture the global characteristics of the aggregate traffic .",
    "the use of an inappropriate traffic model would lead to wrong results when simulating new architectures with such significant input parameter .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed network traffic generated by p2p iptv applications .",
    "we performed an extensive measurement campaign during the 2006 fifa world cup and we measured the most popular p2p iptv applications on the internet .",
    "we used wavelet transform based method to study the p2p iptv traffic at different time scales and to characterize its properties .",
    "+ our multiscale traffic analysis show how different are the scaling properties of the tcp and udp traffics .",
    "for all the applications , the signaling traffic has a significant impact on the download traffic but not on the upload traffic .",
    "it involves scalability concerns regarding the p2p iptv signaling protocols used to download the video data .",
    "the udp traffic is stationary and leads to long - range dependency of the traffic .",
    "the choice of udp as transport protocol for non - elastic transfers in p2p networks becomes not so trivial since the traffic lrd indicates that the traffic is not predictable in the network .",
    "the scaling properties of the download traffic are different from the upload traffic .",
    "the traffic granularity and both traffic directions have to be taken into account to model p2p iptv traffic accurately . + currently , we are analyzing the traffic collected during other games and under different network environments to extend our observations . it will allow us to have a finer analysis of our findings and could also help to answer to the open questions introduced by this work . in a long - term work ,",
    "the characterization of the p2p iptv traffic will help us to accurately model and simulate such systems .",
