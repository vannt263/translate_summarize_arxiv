    "as there is no uniformity about the concept of regular sequence , we first recall the following definitions that we shall use in this note .    @xmath6    let @xmath0 be a commutative noetherian ring and @xmath7 .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is a _ strongly regular sequence _ on a @xmath0-module @xmath8 , if for every @xmath9 the element @xmath10 is a non - zero divisor for @xmath11 .",
    "the sequence @xmath2 is called a _ regular sequence _ on a @xmath0-module @xmath8 , if for every @xmath12 supp(@xmath13 , the sequence @xmath2 in the local ring @xmath14 is a strongly regular sequence on the @xmath14-module @xmath15 .",
    "note that , in contrast to most of the standard text books , we do not assume the @xmath16 for a strongly regular sequence @xmath2 . for general notations in commutative algebra",
    "we also refer to @xcite .",
    "if the sequence @xmath2 is strongly regular respectively regular on the @xmath0-module @xmath8 , then the same is true for the sequence @xmath17 on the @xmath18-module @xmath19 , where @xmath18 is an arbitrary flat noetherian @xmath0-algebra .",
    "note that every sequence is a strongly regular as well as regular sequence on the zero module .",
    "further , it is clear that a strongly regular sequence is a regular sequence but not conversely .",
    "for example :    let @xmath20 $ ] be the polynomial ring in three indeterminates over a field @xmath21 and let @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath23 is a regular sequence on the @xmath24-module @xmath0 but not a strongly regular sequence .",
    "the difference between regular and strongly regular sequences is well - illustrated in the following statement given in chapter  ii , 6.1 of @xcite .",
    "@xmath6    _ let @xmath8 be a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring @xmath0 and let @xmath1",

    "the sequence @xmath26 is a regular sequence on @xmath8 .",
    "it can be easily seen that ( see the proof of proposition  3 , chapter  iv , a ,  1 of @xcite ) a sequence @xmath2 in a commutative noetherian ring @xmath0 is a regular sequence for a finitely generated @xmath0-module @xmath8 if and only if the koszul complex @xmath27 gives a resolution of @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath2 is a regular sequence on @xmath8 , then for every permutation @xmath29 the sequence @xmath30 is also regular for @xmath8 .",
    "further , the above proposition implies that the sequence @xmath31 is strongly regular on @xmath8 for every @xmath29 if and only if all subsequences of @xmath2 are regular on @xmath8 . for the sake of completeness let us recall definition  2 .",

    "then the length of a maximal regular sequence on @xmath8 in the maximal ideal @xmath33 is called the depth of @xmath8 over @xmath0 and is denoted by depth@xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath8 is finitely generated then depth can be ( cf .",

    "let @xmath43 and let @xmath44 be a minimal prime ideal in @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath46 and so depth@xmath47 by ( ii ) . since @xmath48 , we have hom@xmath49 and so @xmath50 by chapter  6 ,  18 , lemma  4 of @xcite , where @xmath51",

    "but then @xmath54 , since otherwise @xmath55 by the ( generalised ) krull s theorem ( see @xcite , corollary  4 , chapter  iii , b ,  2 ) .",
