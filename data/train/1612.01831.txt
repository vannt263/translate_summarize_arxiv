    "therefore , the minimum size of the particle @xmath64 implied by the non - commutativity gives the indication that the flowing into the small channel becomes difficult due to the finite size effect of the particle .",
    "so , we may hope that the hydrodynamics on the non - commutative space gives the hydrodynamics of the granular materials .    in the above examples , the viscous force vanishes , @xmath65 , and hence the behavior of @xmath33",

    "the flow is assumed to be uniform along the left boundary @xmath82 an obstacle is placed at 15 cm down stream , and so the flow is separated by this obstacle and is guided to the upper or the lower open channels .",

    "we have considered the flow analysis given above , with the following intention : the hydrodynamics on the non - commutative space may give the minimum area @xmath3 to the size of the constituent particles , so that if @xmath3 is introduced , then the flow rate passing through the small slit ( s ) is reduced and that passing through the large slit ( l ) is increased while keeping the total flow rates constant .",

    "so , we wish to take a large value of re , but the larger re @xmath87 2000 introduces the turbulent flow , and hence we fix it to 700 . if we consider the water flow , then @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in this case , if @xmath36 is chosen to @xmath90 0.55 cm / s and @xmath37 is chosen to the obstacle length @xmath9111 cm .",

    "this is a characteristic of the usual flow .",
    "the following figures show the snapshots of the flow at @xmath94495 [ s ] , 528[s ] , 1025 [ s ] and 2000 [ s ] .",

    "the figures show that the pattern of the vortices are almost stable from the beginning .",
    "there is no active production of vortices just after the obstacle as was observed in the normal flow .",
    "the extra force disturbs the active production of vortices behind the obstacle .",
    "the oscillation arises from the activity of vortices in the down stream . at ( c):1028 [ s ] the vortices in the down stream collapse , but after 1300 [ s ]",

    "however , the discrepancy disappears after @xmath99 = 1000 [ s ] .",
    "in this paper a two - dimensional simulation is performed for the hydrodynamics on the non - commutative space .",
    "the parameter characterizing the non - commutativity of the space , @xmath3 , gives the uncertainty relation of the space , or the minimum size of the fluid particle @xmath101 .",
    "we have prepared the flow path of 21 cm wide and 64 cm length where the obstacle is placed in the middle of the flow , and so the flow should passes through the small 2 cm slit ( s ) or the large 8 cm slit ( l ) .",
    "the simulation is done for the water with reynolds number re = 700 , where the maximal incoming velocity is 0.55 cm / s .",
    "re = 700 is so chosen as the activity of vortex is large , but is not too large to introduce the turbulent flow .",
    "the results we obtained are as follows :    \\(1 ) for the usual flow without @xmath3 , the flow rate at the small slit ( s ) oscillates like a sine curve , but the amplitude of the oscillation diminishes slowly after @xmath941200 [ s ] .",
    "\\(2 ) for the non - commutative flow with @xmath1020.29 cm , the oscillation of the flow rate is small and irregular .",
    "the fluctuation is stabilized after @xmath941200 [ s ] .",
    "\\(3 ) the pattern of the flow is correlated to the activity of the vortices . in the usual flow the oscillation of the flow",
    "late is diminished after the certain time has passed , and this change is related to the occurrence of the  two attached eddies \" . in the non - commutative flow",
    "this  two attached eddies \" appears from the beginning , and hence the flow rates do not actively oscillate .",
    "so , the difference between the usual flow and the non - commutative flow comes from the difference of activities of vortices in the down stream .",
    "as is understood from the analysis in the perfect fluid , the extra force @xmath33 , relevant to the non - commutativity , has the tendency to interrupts the flowing out into the sink , and to expand the size of the vortex in the radial direction .",
    "these effects are small for a measure of the particle size @xmath103 the size of the small slit , sm @xmath104 0.29 cm @xmath103 2 cm @xmath105 0.15 , but they become extremely large near the singular positions such as the position of sink and source and the center of the vortex . therefore , it is important to know how the vortices are created from the boundary layers , especially from the boundary layer of the obstacle near the slits in both cases with and without @xmath3 , as well as to know the difference of the interaction of vortices both in the usual flow and in the non - commutative flow . for this",
    "we have to know the vorticity transportation equation with the extra force @xmath33 , being proportional to the non - commutative parameter squared , @xmath2 .",
