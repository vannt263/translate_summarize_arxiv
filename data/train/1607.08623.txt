    "* ) .    as a result of the aforementioned uncertainties , infrared observations are of particular importance when establishing the cosmic distance scale , as the wavelength regime exhibits a reduced sensitivity to dust obscuration relative to optical data ( i.e. , @xmath13 )",

    "for example , uncertainties associated with the reddening of the large magellanic cloud , a pertinent anchor of the cosmic distance scale , are comparatively marginal in the mid - infrared where @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "<S> near - infrared color - excess and extinction ratios are essential for establishing the cosmic distance scale and probing the galaxy , particularly when analyzing targets attenuated by significant dust . a robust determination of those ratios followed from leveraging new infrared observations from the vvv survey , wherein numerous bulge rr lyrae and type ii cepheids were discovered , in addition to @xmath0 data for classical cepheids and o - stars occupying the broader galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent optical color - excess ratios vary significantly with galactic longitude ( @xmath1 ) , whereas the near - infrared results are comparatively constant with @xmath1 and galactocentric distance ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results derived imply that classical cepheids and o - stars display separate optical trends ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath1 , which appear to disfavor theories advocating a strict and marked decrease in dust size with increasing galactocentric distance . </S>",
    "<S> the classical cepheid , type ii cepheid , and rr lyrae variables are characterized by @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , whereas the o - stars are expectedly impacted by emission beyond @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean optical ratios characterizing classical cepheids and o - stars are approximately @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . </S>"
