    "we showed , that calculating the initial conditions of an heavy ion collision with the urqmd model , yields very similar @xmath1 values for a given beam energy as the simple overlap model .",
    "we then compared an isentropic expansion scenario within a full ( 3 + 1)dimensional ideal hydrodynamic evolution with a chiral eos including a cep with constant @xmath1 lines .",
    "for the hydro evolution , the systems mean values of energy- and baryon - density follow isentropic paths in the @xmath99 phase - diagram , while in the @xmath100 plane , a single cell follows the isentropic path , while the averaged quantities deviate from the isentropic expectation .",
    "most importantly it was shown , that concerning the search for the critical end point , it might not be sufficient to apply a free hadron gas eos to estimate the energy needed to generate a system that , during its expansion , goes through the critical region . applying different eos ( as we have done ) can very much change predictions at what beam energy that cep is reached .",

    "<S> we investigate a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamic expansion of the hot and dense system created in head - on collisions of pb+pb / au+au at beam energies from @xmath0gev . </S>",
    "<S> an equation of state that incorporates a critical end point ( cep ) in line with the lattice data is used . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution are taken from a microscopic transport approach ( urqmd ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the properties of the initial state and the full hydrodynamical calculation with an isentropic expansion employing an initial state from a simple overlap model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the specific entropy ( @xmath1 ) from both initial conditions is very similar and only depends on the underlying equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> using the chiral ( hadronic ) equation of state we investigate the expansion paths for both initial conditions . defining a critical area around the critical point , </S>",
    "<S> we show at what beam energies one can expect to have a sizable fraction of the system close to the critical point . finally , we emphasise the importance of the equation of state of strongly interacting matter , in the ( experimental ) search for the cep .    </S>",
    "<S> heavy ion collisions at intermediate incident beam energies ( @xmath0gev ) have recently attracted more and more attention , since one expects to be able to scan a wide - and by current expectations highly interesting @xcite - region of temperature @xmath2 and baryo - chemical potential @xmath3 in the qcd phase diagram . following recent theoretical investigations ( for recent lattice qcd results </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite , for phenomenological studies see @xcite ) , one hopes to find experimental evidence for a phase transition from hadronic matter ( with broken chiral symmetry ) , to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase ( where chiral symmetry is restored ) . </S>",
    "<S> especially the so called critical end point ( cep ) , a point in the phase diagram that terminates the phase transition - line of the first order transition ( which is expected for high chemical potentials ) , is of great interest .    </S>",
    "<S> key observables like the directed and elliptic flow @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite - but also particle multiplicities , ratios and their fluctuations - are of imminent interest . </S>",
    "<S> they have been predicted and sometimes already shown to be sensitive to the properties of the qcd matter , i.e. to the equation of state ( eos ) and the active degrees of freedom , in the early stage of the reaction . and </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the energy dependences of various observables show anomalies at low sps energies which might be related to the onset of deconfinement @xcite .    for a hydrodynamical modelling of heavy ion reactions to study these observables </S>",
    "<S> one needs to specify initial conditions , i.e. an infinite set of space - time points with their corresponding energy- and baryon density . since experimental data provides mainly information that is integrated over the systems time evolution , the initial state for hydrodynamical simulations has to be inferred from model assumptions or by educated guessing in comparison to data . </S>",
    "<S> the latter approach - usually applied for relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of nuclear collisions - is , however , by no means straight forward and highly non - trivial : the connections between ( observed ) final state and the inferred initial conditions is blurred by the unknown equation of state , potential viscosity effects , and freeze - out problems . </S>",
    "<S> another issue concerns the assumption of thermal equilibrium , which is probably not true at least for the early stage of a heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been attempts to solve these problems by describing such collisions with viscous or multi - fluid - hydrodynamic models @xcite , but the practical application of these models is difficult . to avoid ( some of ) these problems in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we describe the initial stages of the collision with a non - equilibrium transport model ( urqmd ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the so obtained distributions for energy- and baryon - density as initial conditions for a one - fluid but fully ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamical calculation . for the hydrodynamical evolution </S>",
    "<S> an eos with a first order chiral phase transition and a cep at finite @xmath3 is applied .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organised as follows : in the first part we describe the chiral equation of state that is used in more detail and explain how the structure of the phase diagram with a critical end point is modelled . afterwards </S>",
    "<S> two different scenarios for the initial conditions and the subsequent evolution are compared . </S>",
    "<S> the full hydro evolution with microscopic initial conditions is contrasted with lines of constant entropy per baryon number from a simple overlap model . </S>",
    "<S> then , the results concerning the cep are presented and the influence of the equation of state on the evolution is studied . the last part summarises the paper .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the discussion of the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the present chiral hadronic @xmath6 lagrangian incorporates the complete set of baryons from the lowest flavour-@xmath6 octet , as well as the entire multiplets of scalar , pseudo - scalar , vector and axial - vector mesons @xcite . in mean - field approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the expectation values of the scalar fields relevant for symmetric nuclear matter correspond to the non - strange and strange chiral quark condensates , namely the @xmath7 and its @xmath8 counterpart @xmath9 , respectively , and further the @xmath10 and @xmath11 vector meson fields . </S>",
    "<S> another scalar iso - scalar field , the dilaton @xmath12 , is introduced to model the qcd scale anomaly . however </S>",
    "<S> , if @xmath12 does not couple strongly to baryonic degrees of freedom it remains essentially `` frozen '' below the chiral transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we focus here on the role of the quark condensates .    interactions between baryons and scalar ( bm ) or vector ( bv ) mesons , respectively , are introduced as @xmath13 here , @xmath14 sums over the baryon octet ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a term @xmath19 with mass terms and quartic self - interaction of the vector mesons is also added : @xmath20 the scalar self - interactions are @xmath21 interactions between the scalar mesons induce the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( first line ) and the scale breaking via the dilaton field @xmath12 ( last two terms ) .    </S>",
    "<S> non - zero current quark masses break chiral symmetry explicitly in qcd . in the effective lagrangian </S>",
