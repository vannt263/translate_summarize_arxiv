    "recently , theoretical as well as experimental studies indicate that the size of shell gaps can alter when changing the n / z ratio leading to changes in magic numbers when going away from the valley of stability @xcite",
    ". an interesting region of the nuclear chart to study this phenomenon is situated around @xmath5ni because of the closed proton shell ( z=28 ) and the closed harmonic - oscillator sub - shell ( n=40 ) .",
    "the robustness of the z=28 shell closure as neutrons are added in the unique - parity orbit @xmath6g@xmath7 is of special interest and the induced core - polarization effects have been studied together with the fragile nature of the n=40 sub - shell closure by means of different experimental approaches .",
    "coulomb - excitation studies in the neutron rich ni isotopes @xcite resulted in small b(e2 ) values for n=40 suggesting a new sub - shell closure in concert with the high excitation energy of the 2@xmath8 state @xcite . on the other hand , grawe _ et al .",

    "recent mass measurements in this region show a very weak irregularity in the two - neutron - separation energies around n=40 giving no evidence for a well - established shell closure @xcite . the same mass region was further studied by means of coulomb excitation and @xmath0-decay experiments in neighboring cu and zn neutron rich isotopes @xcite . from those studies the fragile nature of the n=40 sub - shell closure",
    "was confirmed and the key role of the g@xmath7 orbit was revealed in the systematics .",
    "a common conclusion in the above mentioned surveys is the need for further spectroscopic information in this region and especially towards the more exotic nuclei around the doubly magic @xmath9ni .",
    "another interest for the region around z=28 and 40@xmath10n@xmath1050 is related to the astrophysical rapid neutron - capture nucleosynthesis process i.e. the r - process .",
    "the r - process is responsible for the origin of about half of the elements heavier than iron .",
    "nuclei with closed neutron shells represent a special set of waiting points which cause a vertical diversion of the r - process path in the neutron - rich side of the chart of nuclei .",
    "@xmath9ni is a doubly - magic nucleus that represents the most important waiting point of the r - process @xcite .",
    "for this reason the @xmath0-decay properties of the nuclei in the region as well as the spectroscopic information is of paramount importance in r - process calculations .    in this paper",
    "we report on the @xmath0-decay study of @xmath1cu .",
    "this study is part of a systematic @xmath0-decay study at isolde , cern @xcite of neutron - rich cu isotopes ranging from @xmath11cu to @xmath9cu .",
    "the odd - odd cases have been described in @xcite .",
    "the results on the odd - mass @xmath12cu are discussed in the phd work of t. faul @xcite .",
    "the lowering of the first - excited states with spin and parities 5/2@xmath13 and 1/2@xmath13 , as the neutron number increases in odd copper isotopes with a@xmath1469 @xcite , makes particularly @xmath1cu an interesting physics case .",
    "more specifically the lowering of the 5/2@xmath13 relative to the 3/2@xmath13 state is expected to be strong enough to have a 5/2@xmath13 ground state in @xmath1cu .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the experimental setup used ( sec .",

    "is given for the spin and parity assignments of the ground state and low - lying excited states of @xmath1zn .",
    "the neutron - rich copper isotopes were produced via proton- and neutron - induced fission of @xmath2u target .",
    "more specifically the 1 gev proton beam delivered from the cern ps - booster impinged either directly to the thick 50 g/@xmath15 uranium carbide target or it was sent to a tantalum proton - to - neutron converter to induce fission through the produced spallation neutrons . for the case of @xmath1cu ,",
    "the latter technique was used as to suppress the rb isobaric contamination , produced through spallation and present in the mass - separated beam as the surface ionization of this element is not negligible . another element that is",
    "easily surface ionized is ga .",
    "the ga isotopes are strongly populated by spallation - neutron - induced fission and thus remain present in the mass - separated beam .",
    "the @xmath1cu nuclei were selectively ionized by means of the resonant ionization laser ion source ( rilis ) @xcite and mass separated by the general purpose separator ( gps ) of the isolde facility @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0 detectors are indicated with the light gray colour .",
    "[ setup ] ]    after mass separation , the radioactive beam with a typical energy of 60 kev , was delivered to the @xmath0-decay experimental setup ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "the @xmath1cu nuclei were implanted on a tape which was surrounded by three plastic @xmath16e detectors for the @xmath0-particles detection .",
    "the emitted @xmath17 rays were recorded through two hpge detectors with relative efficiencies 75% ( left ) and 90% ( right ) .",
    "these two detectors were placed in close geometry , typically at 2 cm distance , aiming for the maximum possible detection efficiency .",
    "the full energy of the @xmath0 particles was recorded with the @xmath0 telescope which was installed behind the implantation tape at 0@xmath18 with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the electronics read - out was done in parallel by means of two different ways : the singles mode where the energy signals of the two @xmath17 detectors were recorded together with the e part of the @xmath0 telescope and the list mode data ( lmd ) acquisition mode where the data were recorded in an event by event mode . in the lmd mode ,",
    "the trigger was created whenever a @xmath3 , @xmath19 or a @xmath20 event was recorded .",
    "given the much higher efficiency of the @xmath0 detection setup most of the lmd data corresponds to @xmath0-triggered events .",
    "for a more precise lifetime determination the @xmath1cu beam was sent to a second setup to detect the emitted @xmath0-delayed neutrons .",
    "it consisted of the mainz neutron long counter @xcite with a built - in tape transport system to remove long - lived background after each measurement cycle .",
    "a thin plastic scintillator served for the detection of @xmath0 particles . despite the selectivity of the rilis on mass 77",

    "therefore the @xmath0 rays of the @xmath1cu decay could not be discriminated and no @xmath21 value could be deduced .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0-delayed neutron signal was very clean since the isobaric contaminants do not emit neutrons .",
    "measurements with the rilis lasers off or detuned from the resonance gave only a flat background ( cosmic radiation ) .",

    "only recently , more levels were identified in a decay study at hribf @xcite .",
    "the data set for @xmath1cu can be divided into two parts : the data acquired with the lasers - on resonance and the data with the lasers - off resonance . in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] the main part of the lmd - based data using both hpge detectors is presented .",
    "both the lasers - on and lasers - off spectra correspond to the data recorded during the first 1575 ms after the starting of the implantation period . in this way",
    "almost the full statistics of the decay lines from the short - lived @xmath1cu decay are obtained while the intensity of the lines corresponding to the long - lived beam contaminants is reduced . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] the great majority of the transitions observed are non resonant , mainly from the decay of the surface - ionized @xmath1ga . the decay scheme of @xmath1ga is not very well known @xcite but the identification of the @xmath17-ray lines from the @xmath0 decay was feasible given its prominent presence in both on - resonance and off - resonance spectra .",
    "the most intense lines related to @xmath1ga decay are indicated with a diamond symbol ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "other lines that appear both in the lasers - on and lasers - off spectra are from the @xmath0 decay of long - lived daughter nuclei originating mainly from @xmath1ga or from other isotopes deposited in the tape system during previous runs associated with different mass settings . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spectradiff ] the laser - enhanced lines can easily be identified after normalizing the two spectra of fig .",
    "[ spectra ] and subtracting them .",
    "the resulted spectrum contains only the peaks related to the @xmath1cu decay and daughter activity ( @xmath1zn ) . at this point",
    "it is worth noting that even in the subtracted spectrum the strongest @xmath1ga lines are still present .",
    "the negative counts are due to long - living @xmath1ge ( 11.3 h ) which has been growing in since the measurements started .",
    "given the fact that the measurement started with the lasers on resonance and then later with lasers off relatively more counts of @xmath1ge are present in the lasers - off spectrum .",
    "the 772 kev transition is not present in the coincidence spectra due to the long half - life time ( @xmath26 1s @xcite ) of the isomeric state .",
    "since the decay of @xmath1zn is well known @xcite the identification of resonant lines attributed to the @xmath1cu decay or to its daughter @xmath1zn was feasible . in figs .",
    "[ spectra ] and [ spectradiff ] the lines assigned to the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1cu are labelled with a number .",
    "information on the observed @xmath1cu decay lines is summarized in table [ 77cutable1 ] .",
    "the rather high uncertainty on a number of intensities reflects the fact that many of the lines were contaminated . in these cases ,",
    "the uncertainty of the resulted peak area is much higher than in the cases of single isolated peaks - free of contaminants ( e.g. the 1409.3 kev line ) . as a second step of control of the @xmath17-ray assignment procedure , the net area of each transition in the subtracted spectrum",
    "was determined by setting different conditions on the absolute time of each coincident event with respect to the proton pulse of the primary beam . in this way for all the cases reported in table [ 77cutable1 ] the time evolution of the net area counts was determined and was found to be compatible with the expected half - life of @xmath1cu .",
    "the coincidence @xmath17 rays were derived from background - subtracted @xmath17-ray gated spectra with a prompt time gate of 0.6 @xmath27s . in fig .",
    "[ coinc ] , two coincident @xmath17-ray spectra are presented .",
    "as can be seen in both spectra , several lines are coming from the @xmath1ga activity - especially for the 505.7 kev case which is a doublet .",
    "these background lines could be identified since they are also present in the laser - off spectra generated with the same gate conditions .",
    "-ray spectrum of prompt coincidence events with 506 kev ( upper panel ) and 1278 kev ( lower panel ) lines .",
    "only the lines from @xmath1cu decay are labelled .",
    "unlabelled lines come from @xmath1ga contamination .",
    "[ coinc ] ]    due to the fact that most of the lines were contaminated with other lines , an accurate half - life could only be deduced from the time behavior of two lines : the 957 kev and the 1409 kev line .",
    "the resulted half - life ( t@xmath24=467@xmath2243 ms ) is less precise than but consistent with the reported values in @xcite and with our value out of the @xmath0-delayed neutron measurement .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ neutrons ] , a single exponential fit of the neutron - counting rate gives a half - life of 467.4(21 ) ms for @xmath1cu , consistent with , but far more precise than the published values @xcite . the latter value will be further used .    ]",
    "the mainz neutron long counter consists of three concentric rings of @xmath28he tubes .",
    "low - energy neutrons are most likely detected in the innermost ring , higher - energy neutrons cover a larger distance before being moderated and detected and are therefore more likely detected in the middle or outer ring . the so - called `` ring ratios '' , i.e. the relative rate of neutrons detected in the middle to inner or outer to inner ring allow to conclude on the _ average _ energy of the @xmath0-delayed neutrons @xcite .",
    "the energy - dependent detection efficiency was simulated with the monte carlo neutron transport code mcnp .",
    "the simulations were validated with well - known emitters of @xmath0-delayed neutrons .",
    "thus , from the ring ratio we found an average neutron energy of about 450(150 ) kev for @xmath1cu decay .    with a q@xmath29 value of 10.1(4 )",
    "mev for @xmath1cu from the audi - wapstra systematics @xcite , a neutron binding energy of 4.557 mev for @xmath1zn @xcite , and apparent feedings of 21.6% and 4.7% respectively to the 2@xmath30 and 4@xmath30 states in @xmath31zn we deduce apparent log ft values of 4.1(2 ) and 4.4(2 ) to the neutron emitting states populating by neutron emission the 2@xmath30 and 4@xmath30 states in @xmath31zn .",
    "note that frequently several neutron emitting levels populate the same level in the @xmath32 daughter .",
    "therefore the given log ft values are _ cumulative _ over all neutron emitting states populating the 2@xmath30 and 4@xmath30 states in @xmath31zn .",
    "the uncertainty of the log ft values is dominated by the uncertainty in the @xmath33 value of @xmath1cu .        the decay scheme for @xmath1cu shown in fig . [ decay77 ]",
    "could be constructed based on the coincidence relations given in table [ 77cutable1 ] .",
    "furthermore , use has been made of the @xmath0-delayed neutron - decay data from @xmath9cu @xcite ( see also fig . [ neutronem ] ) . in this decay ,",
    "@xmath17 rays of 115 kev and 686 kev were seen in cascade and are also observed here in the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1cu .",
    "the strong 115 kev line is only coincident with the 686 and 1170 kev lines .",
    "the three lines have no connection with other @xmath1cu decay transitions . in principle , as long as no connecting transitions are found , the 115 kev line could be feeding the ( 1/2@xmath34 ) isomeric level at 772 kev instead of the ground state as proposed in @xcite and also assumed here .",
    "the present level scheme is in general agreement with the partial level scheme in @xcite but extends it considerably .",
    "the relative @xmath17-ray intensities were calculated from the lmd - based data taking into account the variation of the detection efficiency with respect to the @xmath17-ray energy .",
    "where necessary , the lines were corrected for contaminating @xmath17 rays using the off - resonance data .",
    "the relative intensities were calculated with respect to the most intense line at 505.7 kev and are given in table [ 77cutable1 ] .",
    "the close detection geometry can , depending on the multiplicity of the @xmath17-decay cascade , lead to summing distortions in the intensities .",
    "as only relative @xmath17-ray intensities are given and the quoted intensity uncertainties are rather high , these distortions can be neglected . concerning the isomeric 772.0 kev line ,",
    "the observed counts were corrected for the mother - daughter decay relation taking into account the implantation and decay cycle . for those transitions observed only in the @xmath20 coincidence spectra , coincidence relations and comparison with other lines were used to extract the intensities .",
    "the @xmath0 feeding shown in fig .",
    "[ decay77 ] was estimated from the intensities given in table [ 77cutable1 ] assuming the feeding to the ground state and to the isomeric state at 772 kev equal to zero .",
    "the same was assumed for the 1363 kev level since the intensity of the 591 kev @xmath17 line de - exciting this level is within the error - bars equal to the total intensity of the @xmath17 rays that feed this level .",
    "the experimental determination of the possible existence of @xmath0 feeding to the ground state and to the isomeric state was impossible since no singles @xmath0 spectrum was acquired that could be compared with the @xmath3 coincidence spectrum .",
    "therefore , and also due to unobserved @xmath17-ray feeding , the given @xmath0-branching values should be considered as upper limits and the _ log ft _ values as lower limits .",
    "the quoted q@xmath29 value was taken from @xcite .",
    "based on the assumption that there is no direct @xmath0 feeding to the ( 1/2@xmath34 ) state at 772 kev , a lower limit of 52% for the @xmath0-decay probability of this state can be deduced on the basis of the balance of feeding and de - excitation @xmath17-ray intensities .",
    "a remarkable feature of the @xmath1cu decay scheme is the fact that the @xmath17 rays de - exciting the high - energy levels are feeding a limited number of excited states avoiding intense feeding of the ( 1/2@xmath13 ) isomeric state or the ( 7/2@xmath35 ) ground state . a similar pattern is observed in the decay of @xmath36cu and @xmath37cu @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ neutronem ] , a partial decay scheme of @xmath38cu is presented with emphasis on the @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission branch .",
    "the strong feeding of the 4@xmath39 and especially 2@xmath39 level in @xmath31zn in the @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission of @xmath1cu , indicates that one or more @xmath1zn high - energy levels above the neutron binding energy get a large fraction of the overall @xmath0 branching . from the intensity balance of the 598.3 kev @xmath17 ray and the @xmath1zn @xmath17 rays ,",
    "a lower limit for the probability for neutron emission in @xmath1cu was obtained : p@xmath4026% in agreement with the recent results of winger _",
    "et al _ @xcite and much higher than reported in @xcite .",
    "taking into account the spin and energy selection rules for @xmath0 decay and neutron emission and the fact that the @xmath0-delayed neutron channel relatively populates for 18% the 4@xmath39 state and for 82% the 2@xmath39 state in @xmath31zn limits the possible spin for the @xmath1cu ground state to 5/2 and 7/2 . combining this information with the fact that the @xmath0-delayed @xmath17 emission of @xmath1cu does feed levels that finally ends up for relatively 54% on the ( 1/2@xmath34 ) isomeric state and for 46% on the ( 7/2@xmath39 ) ground state favours a 5/2@xmath34 assignment for the ground state of @xmath1cu . in this",
    "relative feeding , the 772 kev isomeric transition from the ( 1/2@xmath34 ) to the ( 7/2@xmath39 ) is not taken into account .",
    "the proposition for a 5/2@xmath34 spin and parity of @xmath1cu is in agreement with recent results from laser spectroscopy experiments at isolde where a 3/2@xmath34 assignement could be excluded leaving only 5/2 or 7/2 as possible spins @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0-decay study of @xmath9cu seems to point to a different feeding pattern than observed in our study of @xmath9cu @xcite where the 910 kev 6@xmath41 4@xmath39 transition in @xmath9zn was not seen .",
    "reanalysis of the data confirms the decay scheme of @xcite ( see also fig .",
    "[ neutronem ] ) through the observation of the 576 kev line de - exciting the 3107 kev level with an intensity of 17@xmath2210 % relative to the 730 kev 2@xmath42 0@xmath39 transition and a weak peak at 910 kev line ( 6@xmath41 4@xmath39 transition ) with a relative intensity of 12@xmath229 % .",
    "the observation of the 6@xmath39 level , fed in the decay of @xmath9cu , suggests a spin of at least 5 for the ground state of @xmath9cu .",
    "this high spin makes it unlikely that the @xmath17 transitions observed in the @xmath0-delayed neutron emission of @xmath9cu ( 115 kev , 686 kev ) can be placed on top of the ( 1/2@xmath34 ) isomer in @xmath1zn but rather are connected to the ground state ( 7/2@xmath39 ) .",
    "the spin and parity suggestion of ( 9/2@xmath39 ) , ( 11/2@xmath39 ) of respectively the 115 kev , 800 kev levels is based on the feeding pattern observed in the @xmath43cu decay . the present decay scheme of @xmath1cu is certainly not complete as the relative strong population of the low - lying positive parity states can not result from direct @xmath0 feeding from the ( 5/2@xmath34 ) @xmath1cu ground state .",
    "two explanations are possible : missed @xmath17-ray feeding from higher - lying levels or the existence of a @xmath0-decaying isomer in @xmath1cu .",
    "the latter can propably be excluded as there is no evidence seen in the laser spectroscopy studies of @xmath1cu @xcite .",
    "according to the results of the present work , a 5/2@xmath34 spin assignment is proposed for the ground state of @xmath1cu . in fig . [ levels ] , the systematics of the 1/2@xmath34 , 5/2@xmath34 and 3/2@xmath34 states which correspond to the ground and first excited states of the neutron - rich odd cu isotopes are presented . as can be seen in this figure for @xmath44cu , the position of the first 5/2@xmath34 level lies almost constantly 1 mev above the 3/2@xmath34 ground state .",
    "however , when the @xmath6g@xmath7 neutron orbital starts to be filled , the gap between those levels is dramatically decreased . from the experimental determination of the b(e2 ; 5/2@xmath13 @xmath45 3/2@xmath13 ) values it has become clear that the nature of the first 5/2@xmath13 state in the odd cu isotopes changes from a core - coupled state in the n@xmath1040 isotopes to a single particle state in the n@xmath4640 isotopes .",
    "the single particle character of the 5/2@xmath34 state is established from @xmath47cu onwards @xcite .",
    "the lowering of the 5/2@xmath34 state is strong enough to become the ground state in @xmath36cu @xcite .",
    "the observed sharp drop in energy of the 5/2@xmath34 level , known also as monopole migration , is believed to be caused by the attractive proton - neutron j@xmath48-j@xmath49 tensor force @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the low - energy level structure of the neutron - rich odd - mass zn nuclei is dominated by the p@xmath51 , f@xmath52 , p@xmath24 and g@xmath7 neutron orbitals . the gradual lowering in energy of the unique parity state g@xmath7 as a function of increasing neutron number leads from @xmath47zn on to isomerism .",
    "in fact , from there on the states based on the p@xmath24 and on the g@xmath7 orbitals lie within 500 kev of each other @xcite .",
    "the situation is different in @xmath1zn as the ( 1/2@xmath34 ) state has risen up to 772 kev above the ( 7/2@xmath39 ) ground state .",
    "the positive parity levels assigned as 7/2@xmath39 and 9/2@xmath39 can be produced by quasi - particle couplings of the ( @xmath6g@xmath7)@xmath53 configuration .",
    "a similar system where three quasi - particles in @xmath54g@xmath7 orbit lead to a low - lying 7/2@xmath39 state has been also observed in the ag isotopes where three holes in the @xmath54g@xmath7 shell result in a similar ordering of the 7/2@xmath39 and 9/2@xmath39 levels . the 1/2@xmath34 isomeric state can be interpreted as a @xmath6p@xmath24 single particle state .",
    "coulomb - excitation and laser - spectroscopy studies for the odd - mass zn isotopes that can be performed in the future as well as the results of the recently performed laser spectroscopy experiments for the neutron rich cu isotopes @xcite could contribute for a better understanding of the residual proton - neutron interaction in this mass region and the role of the 1g@xmath7 orbital .",
