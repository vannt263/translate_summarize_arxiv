    "that evolved brains are highly sensitive organs is an everyday observation . viewed as a dynamical system",
    ", a brain may be said to be _ unusually _ susceptible to perturbations and initial conditions .",
    "this leads one to ask whether brains may be operating near some form of instability , or criticality , a hypothesis related to the notions of computation at the edge of chaos ( langton 1990 ) and self - organized criticality ( bak et al .",
    "1987 ) . in this paper",
    "we propose that while most regulation mechanisms at work in the brain act according to a classical homeostasis schema , i.e. , have a stabilizing effect , an opposite effect could result from the regulation of synaptic weights by a specific form of hebbian covariance plasticity .",
    "such a regulation may bring the system near criticality .",
    "we suggest that regulated criticality may be the mechanism whereby sensitivity is _ maintained _ throughout life in the face of ongoing changes in brain connectivity .",
    "hebbian synaptic plasticity ( hebb 1949 ) plays an important role in the development of the nervous system , and is also believed to underlie many instances of learning in the adult .",
    "a _ covariance rule _ of hebbian plasticity roughly states that the change in the efficacy of a given synapse varies in proportion to the covariance between the presynaptic and postsynaptic activities . as noted by many authors ( e.g. sejnowski 1977a , 1977b ; bienenstock et al .",
    "1982 ; linsker 1986 ; sejnowski et al . 1988 ) , a covariance - type rule is preferable to a rule that uses the mere product of pre- and post - synaptic activities because the covariance rule predicts not only weight increases but also activity - related weight decreases , and as a consequence allows convergence to non - trivial connectivity states .",
    "some forms of covariance plasticity have been shown to be optimal for information storage ( willshaw and dayan 1990 ; dayan and willshaw 1991 ; dayan and sejnowski 1993 ) .",
    "also , evidence for hebbian plasticity of the covariance type has been reported in several preparations ( frgnac et al .",
    "1988 , 1992 ; stanton and sejnowski 1989 ; artola et al .",
    "1990 ; dudek and bear 1992 ) .",
    "we shall investigate , in a simple network including excitatory and inhibitory neurons , the effect of covariance plasticity acting as a mechanism of _ regulation , _ rather than supervised learning .",
    "synaptic modification results in changes  quantitative or qualitative  in the activity that reverberates in the network ; these changes in turn cause further modification of the weights , thereby creating a feedback loop between activity and connectivity . studying this loop as such , i.e. , independently from any input and output , we demonstrate that , under fairly general conditions , it causes the network to converge to a critical surface in parameter space , the locus of an abrupt transition between different activity modes . in metzger and lehmann ( 1990 , 1994 ) a similar hebbian rule",
    "has been studied in the context of supervised learning of temporal sequences .",
    "schematically , the convergence to a critical state can be explained as follows .",
    "one mode of behavior of a network including excitatory and inhibitory neurons is oscillation ; such behavior takes place if the synaptic weights linking excitatory neurons to each other  we will refer to these as e - to - e weights  are high enough but not too high .",
    "oscillation entails high covariance values , hence , according to the covariance rule , results in further increase of the e - to - e weights . if however these weights are higher than a certain critical value  which depends on other parameters of the system  oscillatory behavior is impossible , hence covariance is low or zero , hence , in accord with the covariance rule used , the e - to - e weights _ decrease .",
    "_ as a result , the e - to - e weights stabilize around the critical surface that separates the region of oscillation from the region(s ) of steady firing .",
    "our study is conducted in the simplest type of network that will support oscillatory activity : all synaptic weights of a given type are given identical values , and so are all firing thresholds of a given type .",
    "this results in a system with just six parameters  four synaptic weights and two thresholds  and a limited range of behaviors .",
    "essentially , all neurons fire uniformly , either at a constant rate ( the number of possible rates of firing is one or two , depending on parameters ) or periodically in time . in the _ thermodynamic , _",
    "i.e. , large - size , limit , the dynamics of the network is adequately described by a system of differential equations obtained through a classical mean - field approximation .",
    "we first perform a simple bifurcation analysis of this differential system ( guckenheimer and holmes 1983 ) .",
    "we then show that the effect of covariance regulation is to stabilize the parameter state at a surface of transition , where the dynamics exhibits an instability .",
    "such a critical parameter state for a dynamical system may be characterized as _ degenerate . _ a generic , i.e. , non - exceptional",
    ", state is one where one expects to find the system in the absence of further assumptions .",
    "mathematically , a generic state of a dynamical system is in the _ interior _ of a parameter region corresponding to a given behavior , and the system in such a parameter state is said to be _ structurally stable ; _ the set of non - generic parameter states has measure zero .",
    "we shall show that a state of higher degeneracy , characterized as a point of intersection of _ several _ critical surfaces , can be achieved by the simultaneous regulation of _ several _ parameters . in the vicinity of that",
    "highly degenerate state , the system displays a range of behaviors , including chaos .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we study the dynamical properties of our simple network  in the differential - equation formulation  with _ fixed _ parameters ( synaptic weights and firing thresholds ) .",
    "we characterize the bifurcations which take place at the boundaries between domains corresponding to different modes of behavior .",
    "this study is conducted for a _ reduced _ system , where the thresholds are eliminated in such a way as to render the dynamics symmetric about the origin .",
    "section [ regulation ] describes the regulation equations .",
    "section [ reduced ] describes the behavior of the regulated reduced system , and section [ full ] that of the regulated full system .",
    "this section describes the dynamics of the model with fixed parameters .",
    "we first briefly describe a network consisting of a large number ( @xmath0 ) of binary - valued neurons operating under a stochastic dynamics .",
    "however , rather than using this network for our study of plasticity , we make a number of simplifications and approximations , leading to a deterministic two - variable differential system with just six parameters .",
    "the two variables are the excitatory and inhibitory population averages of cell activity in the @xmath0-dimensional model ; the six parameters include the four average weights of the synapses within and between these two populations , as well as the average firing thresholds for the two populations .",
    "we then study the asymptotic behavior of this differential system for various parameter values .",
    "different types of asymptotic behavior , in different regions of the parameter space , correspond to different _ phases _ of the stochastic system , and we pay particular attention to the _ bifurcations _ of the solutions , where the bifurcation parameters are the synaptic weights ",
    "see schuster and wagner ( 1990 ) and borisyuk and kirillov ( 1992 ) for a related bifurcation analysis .",
    "bifurcations correspond to _ phase transitions _ in the statistical - physics formulation ( the original @xmath0-dimensional model ) .",
    "we consider a fully - connected network of @xmath1 excitatory and @xmath1 inhibitory linear - sigmoidal @xmath2-valued neurons , operating under a stochastic dynamics .",
    "we denote the activity of the @xmath3-th excitatory , resp .",
    "inhibitory , neuron by @xmath4 , resp .",
    "@xmath5 , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and we denote the synaptic weights by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath3 is postsynaptic and @xmath10 presynaptic , and the superscripts indicate , for each of the two neurons , whether it is excitatory or inhibitory .",
    "thus , for all @xmath3 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive or zero , whereas @xmath13 and @xmath14 are negative or zero .    the _ local field _ on excitatory neuron @xmath3 , i.e. , the difference between its membrane potential and its firing threshold @xmath15 , is @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , the local field on inhibitory neuron @xmath10 is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the threshold of inhibitory neuron @xmath3 .",
    "the network dynamics is defined by : ( i ) selecting at random , with uniform probability , one of the @xmath0 neurons ; ( ii ) computing its local field @xmath19 , of the form @xmath20 or @xmath21 ; and ( iii ) defining the state of the network at time @xmath22 to be equal to the state at time @xmath23 except , possibly , for the selected neuron , whose state becomes  or stays1 with probability @xmath24 .",
    "parameter @xmath25 is a fixed non - negative number , an _",
    "inverse temperature_. the temperature @xmath26 measures the amount of noise in the system : the higher the temperature , the noisier the dynamics .",
    "the update interval is @xmath27 , so that each neuron is updated on average once every time unit .",
    "this _ asynchronous _ dynamics , of the glauber type ( glauber 1963 ) , is widely used in statistical - mechanics models ; it lends itself to a convenient mean - field approximation ( see below ) .",
    "a system such as the one just described will exhibit a highly diverse range of behaviors , depending on the values of the synaptic weights and firing thresholds .",
    "but we now make the much simplifying assumption that synaptic weights and firing thresholds are _ uniform _ across each class . specifically , for all @xmath28 , we assume that @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fixed parameters , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are non - negative .",
    "the dynamics is thus parameterized by six constants , four synaptic weights and two thresholds ; @xmath25 is a mere multiplicative factor common to all six parameters , yet it is convenient to use it as a seventh parameter . unless otherwise mentioned , @xmath25 will be 1 .    due to this uniformity assumption",
    ", all neurons in any of the two populations experience the same field at any given time .",
    "this system exhibits a limited number of fairly simple behaviors , of which figure 1 is an example .",
    "this figure shows the time variation of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the _ average _ activation levels across the excitatory and inhibitory populations . in this example , parameters are : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "one unit on the time axis corresponds to @xmath0 updates , so that each neuron is updated , on average , once every time unit . for these parameter values , the system _ oscillates .",
    "_ note that the oscillation is not perfectly regular , a finite - size effect .",
    "note also that the inhibitory activity lags somewhat behind the excitatory activity : the excitatory neurons first trigger the inhibitory ones , which in turn extinguish , for a while , the excitatory population .",
    ".4 cm    _ ( insert figure 1 around here ) _    .4 cm the presence of oscillations and the amplitude and shape of the waveform depend on the various parameters .",
    "however , rather than pursuing this study of the stochastic system , we shall consider the approximation that obtains in the _ thermodynamic limit _",
    ", that is , when @xmath50 .",
    "the update interval @xmath51 then goes to 0 and so does each individual synaptic weight .",
    "straightforward approximations ( rubin 1988 ; schuster and wagner 1990 ) then lead to a continuous - time differential system for the population averages of the excitatory and inhibitory activation levels , which we denote , respectively , by @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath54\\\\ \\dot{\\sigma}(t)=.5- \\sigma(t ) + .5\\tanh[\\beta(w{^{\\mbox{\\scriptsize ie}}}s(t)-w{^{\\mbox{\\scriptsize ii}}}\\sigma(t)-h{^{\\mbox{\\scriptsize i } } } ) ] .",

    "we shall now make a last simplification , whose purpose it is to render @xmath59 a fixed point ",

    "a different position for the fixed point could be obtained with an appropriate modification of equations [ chvar ] , yet in the current version the fixed point is also a center of symmetry . for the moment , this hard - wired symmetry should be regarded as an _ ad - hoc _ device , whose purpose is to make the analysis more convenient .",
    "we shall refer to system [ sys_full ] as the _ full _ system , and to system [ sys_red ] as the _ reduced _ system .",
    "we shall see in section [ full ] that under appropriate regulation the two systems behave similarly .",
    "we now discuss some important properties of the reduced system , system [ sys_red ] ( see also rubin 1988 ) .",
    "consider first figure 2a ( phase diagram ) , which shows four trajectories of the state @xmath65 ; the starting points of these trajectories are indicated by triangles .",
    "the parameters ( synaptic weights ) used in this example are identical to those used in figure 1 , i.e. , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "as expected , the asymptotic behavior is _ periodic ; _ there is a limit cycle which attracts all points of the square @xmath66 ^ 2 $ ] , except the unstable equilibrium @xmath67 .",
    "motion is counterclockwise , for , as mentioned above , @xmath56 lags behind @xmath55 .",
    "in addition to these four orbits , figure 2a shows two curves , the @xmath52- and @xmath53-_nullclines _ for system [ sys_red ] .",
    "these are the loci of the points @xmath68 such that @xmath69 , resp .",
    "@xmath70 , vanish .",
    "the equations for the @xmath52- and @xmath53-nullclines are easily seen to be , respectively : @xmath71 @xmath72 the @xmath53-nullcline is an increasing sigmoid - shaped curve , whereas the @xmath52-nullcline generally has the shape of an ` s ' lying on its side .",
    "of particular interest are the intersection points of the two nullclines ; these are the _ fixed points _ of the dynamics . in the case illustrated in figure 2a , the only intersection is @xmath67 , an unstable equilibrium .",
    "trajectories intersect the @xmath52- , resp .",
    "@xmath53- , nullcline in a direction parallel to the @xmath53- , resp .",
    "@xmath52- , axis .",
    "the study of the nullclines is of interest because it is often possible to predict how a parameter change will affect the dynamics of the system by reasoning about how the nullcline diagram will change ; the bifurcation we shall be mostly interested in is associated with a conspicuous change in this diagram .",
    "note that the @xmath52-nullcline is affected by parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 , whereas the @xmath53-nullcline is affected by parameters @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    ".4 cm    _ ( insert figure 2 around here ) _",
    ".4 cm let us consider first the changes brought about by letting parameter @xmath37 grow , starting from the point @xmath73 for which the system oscillates ; other parameters are unchanged .",
    "when @xmath37 grows , the slope of the central , quasi - linear , part of the @xmath52-nullcline increases ( see equation [ snull ] ) ; that part of the curve rotates about the symmetry center ( 0,0 ) . as a result ,",
    "the peak of the @xmath52-nullcline to the right approaches the upper part of the sigmoid - shaped @xmath53-nullcline , and the minimum of the @xmath52-nullcline to the left approaches the lower part of the @xmath53-nullcline .",
    "eventually , at a certain critical value @xmath74 ( subscript ` sn ' stands for ` saddlenode'see below ) , the two curves become tangent to each other .",
    "this happens in two points at once , near the upper right - hand corner and near the lower left - hand corner , due to the symmetry of the system .",
    "this situation is depicted in figure 2b : @xmath37 is exactly equal to the critical value @xmath74 ( with parameters as above , @xmath75 ) , and the nullclines are just tangent to each other .",
    "when @xmath37 grows a little further , each point of contact splits into two intersection points , of which one is an attractor .",
    "figure 2c shows this situation , with @xmath76 , somewhat above the critical value @xmath74 .",
    "four trajectories are shown , in addition to the two nullclines .",
    "the system has five fixed points , three unstable ones and two stable ones ( attractors ) .",
    "only the stable fixed points are of interest to us ; they are very near the upper right - hand and lower left - hand corners of the square , corresponding to high , respectively low , excitatory and inhibitory activities .",
    "the bifurcation occurring at @xmath74 is of the _ saddlenode _ type .",
    "it results in a drastic change of behavior of the system : the periodic attractor disappears and is ` siphoned ' into the two new point attractors .",
    "these two points attract the entire square , except a set of measure 0 which includes the three unstable fixed points .",
    "thus , altough this bifurcation is caused by a mere _ local _ change , namely the intersection of the nullclines , it results in a reorganization of the dynamics that is both abrupt and _ global . _ into system [ sys_red ] . ]",
    "having described the breakdown of oscillations when parameter @xmath37 is increased , we now consider the opposite change , that is , we let @xmath37 decrease .",
    "this results in a decrease of the slope of the central , increasing , portion of the @xmath52-nullcline ( equation [ snull ] ) .",
    "eventually , the curve becomes monotonically decreasing ; this does not alter the number of intersections of the nullclines , point @xmath67 remaining the sole equilibrium .",
    "however , the amplitude of the limit cycle decreases along with @xmath37 .",
    "the cycle eventually collapses to a point ; the equilibrium @xmath67 has then become stable .",
    "this can be seen in a linear stability analysis of system [ sys_red ] around point @xmath67 .",
    "it is easily shown that , in case there are two complex conjugate eigenvalues , . ]",
    "the real part of these eigenvalues is negative if and only if @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath78 is a critical value for parameter @xmath37 .",
    "we define @xmath79 ( with the current parameter setting , @xmath80 ) .",
    "the change of behavior occurring at @xmath81 is a _",
    "normal _ , the bifurcation is subcritical  see footnote 5 . ]",
    "hopf bifurcation .",
    "so far , we studied the behavior of system [ sys_red ] for different values of parameter @xmath37 , all other parameters being fixed .",
    "in other words , we described the system s behavior on a particular 1-dimensional subspace of the 4-dimensional parameter space .",
    "we now extend this study to a 2-dimensional subspace , the @xmath82 plane .",
    "figure 3a is the bifurcation diagram of system [ sys_red ] in that plane , with other parameters as before ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) .",
    "this diagram shows three distinct regions , corresponding to three different attractor configurations ; unstable fixed points and unstable limit cycles are ignored in this diagram . in the middle region  which we call region @xmath83 , for",
    "_ periodic_the system oscillates .",
    "the boundary of this region to the right is the saddlenode bifurcation curve , which we denote @xmath84 ; as discussed above , the rightmost region has _",
    "two _ point attractors , and we call it region @xmath85",
    ". the leftmost region , which we call @xmath86 , has only one point attractor , the center of symmetry @xmath67 ; it is separated from region @xmath83 by the hopf bifurcation curve , a vertical line of equation @xmath87 .",
    "the curve in the lower left of the diagram , separating region @xmath86 from region @xmath85 , is the locus of a _ pitchfork _ bifurcation .",
    "this bifurcation diagram , obtained for one particular set of values of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath25 , is representative of the general case . to region",
    "@xmath85 is of the saddlenode type only for large enough values of @xmath39 ; this range of values corresponds roughly to the straight portion of curve @xmath84 ( figure 3a ) . to see why this is so , consider again figure 2b , the nullcline diagram at the bifurcation , with @xmath89 .",
    "note that the points of contact between the nullclines appear near the corners of the square , far from the origin ; this is due to the fact that @xmath39 is relatively large , hence the slope of the @xmath53-nullcline at the origin is larger than the slope of the @xmath52-nullcline .",
    "the bifurcation is then of the saddlenode type , as described .",
    "if however @xmath39 is small , hence so is the slope of the @xmath53-nullcline at the origin , the transition from @xmath83 to @xmath85 as @xmath37 is increased takes place differently .",
    "a pair of intersection points between the nullclines first split off _ from the origin ; _ these are unstable equilibria .",
    "as @xmath37 increases , these two equilibria move away from the origin , while remaining inside the large stable limit cycle . at a certain critical value for @xmath37",
    "they become stable  a ( double ) subcritical hopf bifurcation  and almost immediately thereafter the large limit cycle disappears .",
    "thus , the transition from region @xmath83 to region @xmath85 really takes place in two steps , giving rise to a _ three - attractor _ behavior : the system has one large limit - cycle attractor _ as well as _ two point attractors , the latter being inside the cycle .",
    "the region of the @xmath82 plane where this behavior takes place is a strip extending along the lower , curved , part of the @xmath90 boundary ; it is too narrow to be seen in figure 3a .",
    "( with parameters @xmath38 and @xmath40 as above and @xmath91 , the three - attractor behavior occurs for @xmath37 between @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for some other values of @xmath38 and @xmath40",
    "this behavior does not occur at all , and the transition from @xmath83 to @xmath85 is always of the saddlenode type . ) for the purpose of this paper ( see footnotes 8 and 11 ) it is important to note that the point attractors appear either _ exactly _ or _ almost _ at the same time as the periodic attractor disappears .",
    "the second approximation in the bifurcation diagram , mentioned only for the sake of completeness , concerns the @xmath86-to-@xmath83 transition .",
    "this is generally a smooth , supercritical , hopf bifurcation .",
    "however , as mentioned in footnote 4 , this hopf bifurcation becomes subcritical for very large values of @xmath39 .",
    "there is thus a narrow region to the left of the bifurcation line @xmath87 where the limit - cycle attractor coexists with the point attractor ( 0,0 ) ; for instance , at @xmath94 , the width of this region is @xmath95 . ]",
    ".4 cm    _ ( insert figure 3 around here ) _    .4 cm in sum , the @xmath82 bifurcation diagram for system [ sys_red ] is characterized by a central periodic - attractor region , a large vertical patch extending to @xmath96 in the @xmath39 direction ( phase @xmath83 ) , flanked by point - attractor regions on each side ( phases @xmath86 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "the transition from @xmath83 to @xmath85 is abrupt ( @xmath84 line ) , while the transition from @xmath86 to @xmath83 is smooth .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , system [ sys_full]the full system  is not amenable to such a thorough analysis ; however , we shall see in section [ full ] that the two systems behave in much the same way under the plasticity rules that we shall now introduce .",
    "whereas in the previous section the synaptic weights @xmath37 and @xmath39 were fixed parameters , they will now be made to evolve . their evolution will obey a hebbian covariance rule , hence be a function of second - order temporal averages of the dynamic variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "synaptic plasticity creates a _ regulation loop : _ changing the parameters affects the dynamics of the system , which in turn alters the second - order moments of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "the main reason for this will be given in the next section ; for now , note that this choice is consistent with the spirit of hebb s principle , for , when considered _ postsynaptically _ to the target neuron , the effect of synapse reinforcement if that target neuron is inhibitory is the opposite of the effect obtained if the target neuron is excitatory .",
    "this section describes the behavior of the regulated reduced system .",
    "we demonstrate that each of the two regulation loops introduced in section [ regulation ] , when acting separately , brings the system to the critical surface @xmath84 , the locus of an abrupt phase transition ( saddlenode bifurcation ) .",
    "we then examine the behavior of the system with the two regulation loops active simultaneously ; we show that under some conditions the state converges to a point on @xmath84 with a remarkable nullcline configuration .",

    "the second stage , consisting of a much slower motion on the @xmath160 surface , depends on the values of the various parameters .",
    "for most parameter settings , including the standard set ( see above ) , the behavior on this critical surface is a slow , _ simple , _ periodic motion , of large amplitude in @xmath68 and very small amplitude in @xmath82 .",

    "once this doubly critical surface is reached , motion becomes slow , depends on parameters , and , when examined in detail , reveals a variety of behaviors , ranging from simple periodic firing to chaos .",
    "this paper proposes that a regulation mechanism underlies criticality in brain dynamics .",
    "in such a scheme , regulation stabilizes the dynamics near an instability .",
    "the force driving the system towards criticality is a covariance - governed modification of synaptic efficacies in a recurrent network . although it has been argued that criticality in some physical systems may be self - organized ( bak et al .",
    "1987 ) , this phenomenon may not be very widespread .",
    "the nervous system is moreover regulated homeostatically to withstand perturbations of various sorts .",
    "it is then of interest to explain how criticality in brain dynamics may nevertheless arise , from a specific , well - documented , mechanism of synaptic plasticity .",
    "the chief motivation for viewing the dynamics of the nervous sytem as critical is the observation that brains are very sensitive organs .",
    "not only do our brains draw distinctions between stimuli that differ only in minute details , they also allow us to establish subtle yet clear - cut boundaries between cognitive categories at different levels .",
    "the various manifestations of hyperacuity in sensory systems may be no more than elaborate forms of signal amplification ; however , in higher cognitive functions such as language , abstract thinking , or , for instance , artistic composition , the ability to create a new category by drawing a fine line ",
    "an ability which manifests itself early in life and stays with us for a long time  argues in favor of regulated criticality .",
    "such a mechanism appears to be necessary in order to explain how sensitivity is _ maintained _ in the face of the profound changes that affect the connectivity of the brain throughout development and learning .",
    "if no such mechanism were present , one would expect that the ongoing modification of the networks which carry mental representations would soon bring these networks to generic states ; as mentioned in section [ intro ] , a dynamical system in a generic state does not show high susceptibility to external influences .",
    "the emergence of new cognitive categories may in effect be likened to a process of morphogenesis in embryology , or differentiation in cell biology . a biological structure that is about to undergo differentiation",
    "is at that particular instant of time unstable , and , as the well - studied mechanism of _ induction _ shows , highly susceptible to external signals . from a dynamical - system perspective , the emergence of qualitatively new behavior , e.g. , the splitting of one attractor into two , is a bifurcation .",
    "the complexification of an individual s cognitive apparatus in the course of his or her life may be viewed as an open - ended sequence of such bifurcations .",
    "such an interpretation has been defended by ren thom ( 1975 ) , and related ideas have been expressed by several authors ( e.g. van der maas and molenaar 1992 ) .",
    "thom ( 1975 ) also suggested that structurally stable non - generic singularities may arise from a process he termed the _ stabilization of thresholds ; _ this process itself would result , in various biological contexts , from the reinforcment of homeostatic mechanisms .",
    "the covariance plasticity rule we use is linear and straightforward .",
    "equation [ regee ] may be viewed as a mean - field version of the covariance rule used in the associative - memory literature ( see e.g. willshaw and dayan 1990 ) .",
    "however , we make a rather different use of this rule . in an associative - memory model , pre- and post - synaptic activities",
    "are generally assumed to be independent , yielding a zero expected value for the covariance .",
    "weights are modified according to the _ instantaneous _ covariance , and , as noted in dayan and sejnowski ( 1993 ) , storage is marked by the departures of the empirical average of this quantity from its expected value , which is zero . in our model , the expected covariance is positive in the oscillatory phase .",
    "the regulation mechanism acts on a _ slow _ time scale , and , although we use the instantaneous covariance in the modification rule ( equation [ regee ] ) , we might as well have used the time - averaged covariance ; fast variations of the instantaneous covariance are actually smoothed out in the integration of the differential equation .",
    "of course by the very principle of regulation proposed , the system does not dwell in the oscillatory phase ; in the regulated state , the average covariance is low .",
    "the other major difference between the situation studied here and the associative - memory paradigm is the assumption of uniform weights . as noted in section [ regulation ] ,",
    "the covariance in our uniform - weight network is simply the variance of the population - averaged activity about its mean , and is always non - negative .",
    "this makes it necessary to subtract from it a positive constant @xmath179 in order to allow for _ decreases _ of the weights .",
    "thus , whereas in associative - memory models a synaptic weight decreases as a result of _ negative _ instantaneous covariance between the pre- and post - synaptic neurons , the condition for weight decrease in our model is that the mean covariance be small or zero , which happens when the system is at rest in a point attractor , of either low or high activity .    the uniform - weight network used in the present study lends itself to a detailed mathematical / numerical analysis .",
    "we performed a bifurcation analysis of the continuous - time differential system that describes the behavior of this network in the thermodynamic limit . this analysis ( section [ full ] ) reveals , among other features , the existence of a critical surface @xmath146 in parameter space , where the system undergoes an abrupt transition from oscillatory behavior to high - rate steady firing .",
    "we showed ( section [ full ] ) that hebbian modification of the e - to - e synaptic weights drives the system toward this surface @xmath146 ; this is the main mechanism of regulated criticality proposed .    however , when the system is at a general position on @xmath146 , it spends most of its time in the high - activity state , which is undesirable .",
    "a more realistic situation results from introducing some form of symmetry between the high- and low - activity phases , making use of the firing thresholds .",
    "we investigated two ways  formally different but functionally equivalent  to do this .",
    "the mathematically simpler way is to enforce an accurate symmetry on the dynamics , by imposing an appropriate relationship between the firing thresholds and the synaptic weights ( equations [ chvar ] ) .",
    "this results in a _ reduced _ system , with only four parameters ; in this system , there occurs a _ double _",
    "bifurcation when the system traverses the critical surface  now denoted @xmath84separating the oscillatory phase from the bistable , high / low , steady - firing phase ( section [ model ] ) .",
    "regulation of the sole e - to - e weight brings the system to this doubly critical surface @xmath84 ( section [ reduced ] ) .",
    "a biologically more satisfactory solution is to _ regulate _ one or both of the firing thresholds so as to control the mean firing rates ( section [ full ] ) .",
    "thus , when we regulate the threshold for the excitatory neurons in addition to the e - to - e weight , the system converges to the intersection of @xmath146 with another critical surface , @xmath147 , which separates the oscillatory phase from the low - activity fixed - point region .",
    "intersection points between @xmath146 and @xmath147 are again doubly critical , and they attract the system for a wide range of parameter values .    when the system is on this doubly critical surface , it takes only a small weight perturbation to induce either of the three behaviors : intrinsic oscillation ( region @xmath83 of section [ full ] ) , high activity , quiescence .",
    "it is easily seen that , when in this state , the network can also be efficiently driven by a small - amplitude time - varying signal , i.e. , an external field ; it is thus highly sensitive to input .",
    "the stabilization at the boundary of a region of oscillatory behavior appears to be consistent with at least one conclusion that can be safely drawn from the recent literature on cortical oscillations , namely the fact that the precise conditions under which these oscillations occur are difficult to pin down .",
    "we further investigated the effect of regulating the e - to - i weight in addition to the e - to - e weight , according to a similar covariance rule .",
    "we showed that regulating these two weights as well as the two firing thresholds results , under appropriate parametric conditions , in convergence to an even more degenerate state .",
    "when the system is in that state , its flow vanishes on an entire one - dimensional curve in the two - dimensional phase space , instead of on isolated points .",
    "this convergence is slow and parameter - dependent , yet it is interesting to note that when the system is in or near this highly degenerate state it exhibits a range of diverse behaviors , including chaos ( section [ full ] ) .",
    "the chaotic behavior shown in figure 8 , c  e consists of an irregular sequence of spontaneous transitions between the three fundamental phases of the system : oscillatory , high - activity , low - activity .    while the uniform - weight network studied in this paper lends itself to a convenient mathematical analysis , it would be interesting to know whether critical behavior may arise from _ local _ covariance plasticity , where synaptic changes are made to depend on pre- and post - synaptic activities relative to individual synapses .",
