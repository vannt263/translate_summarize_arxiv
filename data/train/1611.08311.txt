    "the main source of galactic cosmic rays are likely shock fronts in supernova remnants , where charged particles undergo first - order fermi acceleration @xcite . as the rate of supernovae",
    "is related to the rate at which stars form , one can expect a connection between galactic synchrotron emission and the star formation rate ( sfr ) @xcite .",
    "this coupling is reflected in the fir - radio correlation which has been observed in the local universe @xcite and seems to hold also up to at least intermediate redshifts @xcite .",

    "galaxies hosting an agn can be excluded from the data set by identifying them with x - ray observations @xcite or by detecting radio jets if the latter can be specially resolved .",

    "if the critical frequency is too close to the thermal emission our sfr estimate will not be good .",
    "in this paper we studied the conditions under which non - thermal radio emission can be used to estimate the star formation rate .",

    "radio emission can again be used to determine sfrs also for dense young galaxies . *",
    "the relation between sfr and radio luminosity at different frequencies is described by equation ( [ eq_lnu ] ) .",
    "in addition , we provide simply fitting formulae for normal disk galaxies and starburst systems in equations ( [ eq_correlationfitmw ] ) and ( [ eq_correlationfitm82 ] ) .    our method should be a useful tool for future deep radio surveys , for example with the ska .",
    "most surveys will be performed at a fixed observing frequency . without the information from the spectral flux distribution , special caution is required .",
    "first of all , the critical frequency @xmath4 should be estimated , see equation ( [ eq_nucrit ] ) for local observations and equation ( [ eq_nucritobs ] ) for the high-@xmath2 case . our estimate for the sfr",
    "should only be applied if the observing frequency is above @xmath4 .",
    "otherwise the synchrotron emission is absorbed and the radio flux is not correlated with the sfr .",
    "the latter can then be estimated with the fitting formulas given in equations ( [ eq_correlationfitmw ] ) for normal disk galaxies and in equation ( [ eq_correlationfitm82 ] ) for starbursts .",
    "+ we note however , that our model includes several free parameters which are summarized in table [ table_props ] .",
    "while the fitting formulas given in equations ( [ eq_correlationfitmw ] ) and ( [ eq_correlationfitm82 ] ) are for our fiducial cases , the accuracy can be increased if additional parameters of the galaxy , like the gas density and the scale height , are known .",
    "additionally , the thermal and the free - free contribution might be important especially at higher radio frequencies , or at even at lower frequencies if the spectrum is highly redshifted .",
    "the latter contributions depend on the galaxy s temperature and surface area .",
    "for example , the thermal peak in the spectrum of the starburst galaxy arp 220 occurs above approximately @xmath91 ghz ( see figure [ plot_realspectra ] ) . in the observed spectrum of a similar galaxy at @xmath98 ,",
    "the flux would be thermally dominated already at frequencies of @xmath99 ghz .",
    "additionally , the presence of an agn should be excluded , which could easily dominate the galactic radio emission .",

    "<S> understanding the evolution of galaxies and in particular their star formation history is a central challenge of modern cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> future radio telescopes will be able to observe galaxies at extremely high redshifts and make it possible to constrain theoretical scenarios of galaxy evolution . along these lines , it is of crucial importance to have theoretical tools for analyzing the observational data from future radio surveys . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a physical model that explains the correlation between the non - thermal radio flux and the star formation rate ( sfr ) . </S>",
    "<S> this model is based on an analytical description of the steady - state cosmic ray spectrum including energy losses by ionization , bremsstrahlung , inverse compton scattering , synchrotron radiation , and galactic outflows . as cosmic rays </S>",
    "<S> are produced in supernova remnants , their injection rate is proportional to the supernova rate and thus also to the sfr . </S>",
    "<S> when these highly energetic charged particles travel in the magnetized interstellar medium they emit non - thermal synchrotron radiation . as a result </S>",
    "<S> there is a relation between the sfr and the non - thermal radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial point is that synchrotron emission can be absorbed again by the free - free mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression becomes stronger with increasing number density of the gas , more precisely of the free electrons , and with decreasing frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we present an estimate of the critical frequency above which radio emission can be used as a tracer for the sfr . </S>",
    "<S> if the observed galaxy is redshifted , this critical frequency moves along with other spectral features to lower values in the observing frame . </S>",
    "<S> the method can therefore be successfully applied at high redshift . however , for high redshift , i.e.  @xmath0 , and observations at high radio frequency bands , i.e.  @xmath1 ghz , special caution should be paid , as the observed flux might be dominated by free - free emission or the thermal contribution . </S>"
