    "since the paper of matsui and satz @xcite there is a steady interest in the problem of @xmath0 suppression in a heavy - ion collision . the question is if this suppression can be treated as a signature for a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) or if it can be explained by @xmath0 absorption in a hadron gas which appears instead of the qgp in the central rapidity region ( crr ) of the collision @xcite . in the following paper",
    "we shall explore the latter possibility .",
    "the existence of the qgp  the novel phase of hadron matter , has been predicted upon lattice qcd calculations ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one gets from those calculations the critical temperature @xmath1 in the range of 150 - 270 mev .",
    "the upper limit belongs to a pure @xmath2 theory , whereas adding quarks causes lowering of @xmath1 even to about 150 mev ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "all lattice calculations have been performed for zero quark and baryon chemical potential only . additionally to the fact that lattice estimations could not be treated literally , in relativistic heavy ion collisions",
    "there is a finite baryon chemical potential . as a result",
    ", the above - mentioned evaluations of @xmath1 can be understood only as a measure of the order of the magnitude of real @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the assumption that at initial temperatures around 200 mev ( as in our model ) a hadron gas still exists is realistic entirely . as far as the hadron gas is considered itself in that range of temperature , it was shown in @xcite that the temperature increases with energy density when continuum excitations ( string degrees of freedom ) are not taken into account .",
    "continuum excitations gives the limiting temperature .",
    "this reproduces results of the hagedorn bootstrap model@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamical analysis can also be based on particle ratios @xcite and this gives the temperature as in our model .",
    "the same result is obtained from the microscopic cascade model ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the following paper",
    "we shall continue our previous investigations @xcite into the problem of @xmath0 suppression observed in a heavy - ion collision ( for experimental data see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "now , we shall focus on the dependence of the suppression on the initial energy density reached in the crr .    in our model ,",
    "@xmath0 suppression is the result of a @xmath4 state absorption in a dense hadronic matter through interactions of the type    @xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes a hadron , @xmath7 is a charm meson and @xmath8 means a particle which is necessary to conserve the charge , baryon number or strangeness .",
    "first , the @xmath0 is absorbed by nucleons in colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "later , the @xmath0 is absorbed by secondary hadrons produced in the collision . in the simpler scenario",
    "those secondary hadrons expand longitudinally along collision axis @xcite and the time evolution is given by bjorken s scaling dynamics @xcite .",
    "the importance of secondaries scattering becomes more and more important at higher energies since secondary production grows with energy as well .",
    "we assume that at very high energies secondaries form a dense hadronic gas in a state of thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "a chemistry will be given by equation of state of an ideal gas consisting of different species of massive hadrons .",
    "a problem of thermal and chemical equilibration of an hadronic fireball formatted in a heavy collision is still far from being solved .",
    "recent results @xcite , based on parton cascade models , suggest that in big systems the equilibration time for heavier particles is longer than for lighter particles .",
    "the thermal equilibrium is established quickly , in about 5 fm / c , much faster than the chemical equilibrium .    to keep our model as simple as possible we consider the one temperature model .",
    "this allows us to reduce the number of external parameters .",
    "it is obvious that any new parameter would result in a better fit to experimental data .",
    "the hadronic matter is in a state of an ideal gas of massive hadrons in thermal and chemical equilibrium and consists of all species up to @xmath9 baryon .",
    "time evolution is given here by conservation laws combined with assumptions about the space - time structure of the system .",
    "a corresponding equation of state of the ideal gas makes then possible to express gas parameters such as temperature and chemical potentials as functions of time .",
    "an ideal gas of real hadrons has a very interesting feature : it cools much slower than a pion gas when expands longitudinally .",
    "we have checked numerically that for the initial energy densities @xmath10 corresponding to initial temperatures @xmath11 of the order of 200 mev and for the freeze - out @xmath12 not lower than about 100 mev , the time dependence of the temperature of the expanding gas still keeps the well - known form @xmath13 ( we put @xmath14 fm ) .",
    "only the exponent @xmath15 changes from @xmath16 for massless pions to the values @xmath17-@xmath18 for massive realistic hadrons . as a result ,",
    "the time of the freeze - out @xmath19 is much greater for the hadron gas than for the pion one .",
    "for instance , when we take @xmath20 mev and @xmath21 mev we obtain @xmath22 fm ( @xmath23 ) for the hadron gas and @xmath24 fm ( @xmath25 ) for the pion gas .",
    "the lower @xmath12 , the stronger difference . for @xmath20 mev and @xmath26",
    "mev we have @xmath27 fm ( @xmath23 ) for the hadron gas and @xmath28 fm ( @xmath25 ) for the pion gas .",
    "this has a direct consequence for @xmath0 suppression : the longer the system lasts , the deeper suppression causes ( see fig.[fig.1 . ] ) .",
    "we are going to calculate a survival factor for @xmath0 when new , more realistic conditions are taken into account .",
    "we consider a hadronic gas which is produced in the crr region .",
    "this gas expands both longitudinally and transversely .",
    "the longitudinal expansion is a traditional adiabatic hydrodynamical evolution @xcite , the transverse expansion is considered as the rarefaction wave .",
    "an initial energy density depends now on the impact parameter @xmath29 and on the geometry of the collision .",
    "the concept of the description of @xmath0 absorption in the hot hadronic matter is based on the application of the relativistic kinetic equation as it was postulated in @xcite . as the hadronic medium a pion gas was taken into account there .",
    "our hadronic medium consists of hadrons from the lowest up to @xmath9 as constituents of the matter in the crr .",
    "this gives different physical properties important for the absorption processes as compared to the absorption in a pion gas  cooling time , threshold effects , etc .",
    "it allows us to consider here also a case with non - zero baryon number density .",
    "we take into account here some physical effects which were neglected or not fully treated in @xcite .",
    "thresholds for @xmath30 reactions as well as relative velocities are examined completely , but both these effects are ignored in final calculations in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the crr also @xmath0 absorption in the nuclear matter is considered simultaneously here . in the final estimations of @xmath0 survival fraction ,",
    "the woods - saxon nuclear matter density distribution is used in the presented model .",
    "as far as the hydrodynamic is concerned , the full solution of hydrodynamic equations ( for the baryon number density equal to zero ) with the use of the method developed in @xcite was explored in @xcite , but with different initial temperature profile . here , for simplicity of numerical calculations we assumed the uniform initial temperature distribution with the sharp edge at the border established by nuclei radii ( see fig.[fig.2 . ] ) .",
    "for such an initial distribution , and for a central collision and the baryon number density equal to zero , hydrodynamic equations are solved numerically in @xcite .",
    "the resulting evolution can be decomposed into the longitudinal expansion inside a slice bordered by the front of the rarefaction wave and the transverse expansion which is superimposed outside of the wave .",
    "but the temperature decreases very quickly outside the wave ( at least at times not greater than the half of the freeze - out time ) , so it is reasonable to ignore the influence of the flow outside of the rarefaction wave as we do in our model .",
    "since we are dealing with small but nevertheless non - zero baryon number densities , we assume that the full hydrodynamic evolution looks like the same in this case . for the longitudinal expansion  the most important part of the hydrodynamical evolution , this assumption is confirmed by our investigations into the time dependence of the temperature of the hadron gas , where the same pattern ( see ( [ temperature ] ) ) has been obtained approximately as in the case of a massless baryonless ideal gas @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 suppression on the impact parameter @xmath29 is treated here more rigorously than in @xcite .",
    "in fact the only approximation of the survival factor ( with respect to its exact expression for the case of the finite - size effects and the transverse expansion taken into account ) is done by treating the time @xmath0 needs to escape from the hadron matter in the transverse plane on the average ( over the initial @xmath0 positions ) .",
    "the effective freeze - out time @xmath31 ( denoted by @xmath32 herein ) is therefore the function of both the impact parameter and @xmath0 transverse momentum , whereas @xmath31 is evaluated only for given @xmath29 ( for some assumed average @xmath0 transverse momentum , namely equal to 1 gev ) in @xcite .",
    "for an ideal hadron gas in thermal and chemical equilibrium , which consists of @xmath33 species of particles , energy density @xmath34 , baryon number density @xmath35 , strangeness density @xmath36 and entropy density @xmath37 read ( @xmath38 always )    [ eqstate ] @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41",
    "@xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the mass , baryon number , strangeness , chemical potential , spin and a statistical factor of specie @xmath50 respectively ( we treat an antiparticle as a different specie ) . and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are overall baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials respectively .    we shall work here within the usual timetable of the events in the crr of a given ion collision ( for more details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we fix @xmath54 at the moment of the maximal overlap of the nuclei .",
    "after half of the time the nuclei need to cross each other , matter appears in the crr .",
    "we assume that soon thereafter matter thermalizes and this moment , @xmath55 , is estimated at about 1 fm @xcite .",
    "then matter starts to expand and cool and after reaching the freeze - out temperature it is no longer a thermodynamical system .",
    "we denote this moment as @xmath56 . as we have already mentioned in the introduction , this matter is the hadron gas , which consists of all hadrons up to @xmath9 baryon .",
    "the expansion proceeds according to the relativistic hydrodynamic equations and for the longitudinal component we have the following solution ( for details see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are initial densities of the entropy and the baryon number respectively .",
    "the superimposed transverse expansion has the form of the rarefaction wave moving radially inward with a sound velocity @xmath60 and the transverse flow which starts outside the wave @xcite .",
    "but as it has been mentioned in the introduction , since the temperature decreases rapidly outside the wave ( for the most important times for absorption processes ) , we shall ignore possible @xmath0 scattering there .",
    "it means that @xmath0 suppression is slightly underestimated here .    to obtain the time dependence of temperature and baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials one has to solve numerically equations ( [ barnumb ] - [ entropy ] ) with @xmath37 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 given as time dependent quantities . for @xmath61 , @xmath62",
    "we have expressions ( [ hydro ] ) and @xmath63 since we put the overall strangeness equal to zero during all the evolution ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the sound velocity squared is given by @xmath64 and can be evaluated numerically @xcite .",
    "in a high energy heavy - ion collision , charmonium states are produced mainly through gluon fusion and it takes place during the overlap of colliding nuclei . for the purpose of our model , we shall assume that all @xmath66 pairs are created at the moment @xmath54 . before the fusion",
    ", gluons can suffer multiple elastic scattering on nucleons and gain some additional transverse momentum in this way @xcite .",
    "this manifests for instance in the observed broadening of the @xmath67 distribution of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we express this effect by the transverse momentum distribution of the charmonium states    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the mean squared transverse momentum of @xmath0 gained in an a - b collision with the initial energy density @xmath70 .",
    "the momentum can be expressed as ( for details see @xcite )    @xmath71    with @xmath72 @xmath73gev and @xmath74 gev@xmath75 taken from a fit to the @xmath0 data of na38 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the expression in ( [ transv ] ) is normalized to unity and is treated as the initial momentum distribution of charmonium states here .    for the simplicity of our model",
    ", we shall assume that all charmonium states are completely formed and can be absorbed by the constituents of a surrounding medium from the moment of creation .",
    "it means that we neglect a whole complex process of @xmath0 formation as presented in @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the above - mentioned process is that , soon after the moment of production , the @xmath66 pair binds a soft gluon and creates a pre - resonance @xmath76 state , from which , after a time of the order of 0.3 fm , a physical charmonium state is formed .",
    "this means that the possible nuclear absorption of charmonium is , in fact , the absorption of the @xmath76 state .",
    "but the latest has the cross - section @xmath77 mb , which is much higher than @xmath78 absorption cross - section @xmath79 mb obtained from p - a data @xcite .",
    "this justifies our assumption : taking into account @xmath76 absorption instead of charmonium disintegration in the nuclear matter would only strengthen @xmath0 suppression .",
    "according to the above assumption , charmonium states can be absorbed first in the nuclear matter and soon later , when the matter appears in the crr , in the hadron gas .",
    "since these two processes are separate in time , @xmath0 survival factor for a heavy - ion collision with the initial energy density @xmath70 , may be written in the form    @xmath80    where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are @xmath0 survival factors in the nuclear matter and the hadron gas , respectively .",
    "for @xmath83 we have the usual approximation @xcite    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the nuclear matter density and @xmath86 the mean path length of the @xmath0 through the colliding nuclei . for the last quantity , we use the expression given in @xcite :    @xmath87\\ , \\label{8}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the nuclear density profile function , @xmath90 the nuclear matter density distribution ( normalized to @xmath91 ) and @xmath29 the impact parameter . how to obtain @xmath70 as a function of @xmath29",
    "will be presented further .    to estimate @xmath92 we follow the idea presented in @xcite , but now generalized to the case of the gas which consists of different species of particles .",
    "we shall focus on the plane @xmath93 ( @xmath94 is a collision axis ) and put @xmath0 longitudinal momentum equal to zero .",
    "now the @xmath67-dependent @xmath0 survival factor @xmath95 is given by ( for details see @xcite )    @xmath96    where the sum in the power is over all taken species of scatters ( hadrons ) , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are four momenta of @xmath0 and hadron specie @xmath50 respectively , @xmath99 is the velocity of the former , @xmath100 states for the absorption cross - section of @xmath101 scattering and @xmath102 is the relative velocity of @xmath103 hadron with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath104 and @xmath44 denote @xmath0 and @xmath103 masses , respectively ( @xmath105 mev ) , @xmath102 reads    @xmath106    the upper limit of the time integral in ( [ 9 ] ) , @xmath31 , is equal to @xmath56 or to @xmath107  the moment of leaving by a given @xmath0 of the hadron medium , if the final - size effects are considered and @xmath108 .",
    "for @xmath100 we have assumed that it equals zero for @xmath109 and is constant elsewhere ( @xmath110 is a charm meson mass , @xmath111 mev ) . for hadron specie @xmath50",
    "we have usual bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution ( we neglect any possible spatial dependence here )    @xmath112    in the following , we shall consider only @xmath0 initial distribution @xmath113 that factorizes into @xmath114 and the momentum distribution @xmath115 will be given by ( [ transv ] ) .",
    "we assume at the first step that the transverse size of the hadron medium is much greater than @xmath56 and also much greater than the size of the area where @xmath116 is non - zero .",
    "additionally we assume that @xmath116 is uniform and normalized to unity .",
    "note that the first assumption overestimates the suppression but the second , in the presence of the first , has no any calculable effect here . as a result , @xmath95 simplifies to    @xmath117    to obtain @xmath92 one needs only to integrate ( [ 12 ] ) over @xmath67 :    @xmath118    now we would like to take the final - size effects and the transverse expansion into account in our model . to do this directly",
    ", we would have to come back to the formula given by ( [ 9 ] ) and integrate it , instead of ( [ 12 ] ) , over @xmath67 .",
    "but this would involve a five - dimensional integral ( the three - dimensional integral over @xmath119 simplifies to the one - dimensional one , in fact ) instead of the three - dimensional integral of ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we need to simplify in some way the direct method just mentioned above .",
    "we shall define an average time of leaving the hadron medium by @xmath0 s with the velocity @xmath120 produced in an a - b collision at impact parameter @xmath29 , @xmath121 . then",
    ", if this quantity is less than @xmath56 , we will put it instead of @xmath56 as the upper limit of the integral over @xmath122 in ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "let us consider an a - b collision at impact parameter @xmath29 .",
    "since we will compare final results with the latest data of na50 which are for pb - pb collisions @xcite , we focus on the case of a = b here .",
    "so , for the collision at impact parameter @xmath29 we have the situation in the plane @xmath93 as presented in fig.[fig.2 . ] , where @xmath123 means the area of the overlap of the colliding nuclei .",
    "we shall assume here , that the hadron medium , which appears in the space between the nuclei after they crossed each other also has the shape of @xmath123 at @xmath55 in the plane @xmath93 . and additionally , the transverse expansion starts in the form of the rarefaction wave moving inward @xmath123 at @xmath55 .",
    "then , for a @xmath0 which is at @xmath124 at the moment @xmath55 and has the velocity @xmath125 we denote by @xmath107 the moment of crossing the border of the hadron gas .",
    "it means that @xmath107 is a solution of the equation @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the nucleus radius and @xmath128 for the angel between @xmath129 and @xmath125 such that the @xmath0 will cross this part of the edge of the area of the hadron gas which was created by the projectile and @xmath130 in the opposite .",
    "having obtained @xmath107 , we average it over the angel between @xmath129 and @xmath125 , i.e. we integrate @xmath107 over this angel and divide by @xmath131 .",
    "then we average the result over @xmath123 with the weight given by    @xmath132    and we obtain @xmath133 .",
    "so , the final expression for @xmath92 when the transverse expansion is taken into account reads    @xmath134    where @xmath135 .",
    "we compare our theoretical estimations for @xmath0 survival factor with the experimental data @xcite presented as a function of @xmath70 .",
    "usually , this quantity is estimated from the well - known bjorken formula    @xmath136    where @xmath137 is the pseudo - rapidity range and @xmath138 is the neutral transverse energy .    in further considerations we will need the formula for the number of participating nucleons as a function of impact parameter @xmath29 , which is given by the rough approximation ( commonly used in the early nineties )    @xmath139    or in the term of the number of `` wounded '' nucleons @xcite    @xmath140^{b}\\right\\ } + \\int d^{2}\\vec{s}\\ ; t_{b}(\\vec{s } - \\vec{b } )",

    "note that @xmath141 is estimated for the uniform nuclear matter density with @xmath142 fm and @xmath143 fm , whereas @xmath144 is evaluated for the woods - saxon nuclear matter density distribution with parameters taken from @xcite . with the use of @xmath144 ,",

    "the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath138 has been extracted directly from na50 data @xcite .",
    "we shall later see that the low @xmath29 region ( central collisions ) is crucial for the understanding of experimental data .",
    "also different plots in fig.[fig.4 .",
    "] will lead to different ranges of initial energy densities obtained from formula ( [ etpart ] ) or given by na50 collaboration @xcite .",

    "[ hadgas ] . but to follow all that procedure we need initial values @xmath58 and @xmath59 . to estimate initial baryon number density @xmath59 we can use experimental results for s - s @xcite or au - au @xcite collisions . in the first approximation",
    "we can assume that the baryon multiplicity per unit rapidity in the crr is proportional to the number of participating nucleons .",
    "for a sulphur - sulphur collision we have @xmath159 @xcite and 64 participating nucleons . for the central collision of lead nuclei",
    "we can estimate the number of participating nucleons at @xmath160 , so we have @xmath161 .",
    "having taken the initial volume in the crr equal to @xmath162 fm , we arrive at @xmath163 @xmath164 .",
    "this is some underestimation because the s - s collisions were at a beam energy of 200 gev / nucleon , but pb - pb at 158 gev / nucleon . from the au - au data extrapolation",
    "one can estimate @xmath165 @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "these values are for central collisions , and for the higher impact parameter ( a more peripheral collision ) the initial baryon number density should be much lower .",
    "so , to simplify numerical calculations we will keep @xmath59 constant over the all range of @xmath29 and additionally , to check the possible dependence on @xmath59 , we will do our estimations for @xmath59 substantially lower , i.e. @xmath166 @xmath164 .",
    "now , to find @xmath58 , first we have to solve ( [ energy ] - [ strange ] ) with respect to @xmath167 , @xmath53 and @xmath52 , where we put @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath63 .",
    "then , having put @xmath167 , @xmath53 and @xmath52 into ( [ entropy ] ) we obtain @xmath58 . finally , expressing left sides of ( [ barnumb],[entropy ] ) by ( [ hydro ] ) and after then solving ( [ barnumb ] - [ entropy ] ) numerically we can obtain @xmath167 , @xmath53 and @xmath52 as functions of time .",
    "in fact , evaluating formulae ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) we do the following : first , we calculate @xmath170 which turns out to be very well approximated by the expression      and then we put this approximation into ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) . and for @xmath158 and @xmath157 in @xmath172 we put solutions of ( [ barnumb],[strange ] ) where @xmath35 is given by ( [ hydro ] ) , @xmath167 by ( [ temperature ] ) and @xmath63 .",
    "but the exponent @xmath15 in ( [ temperature ] ) has proven not to be unique for the whole range of @xmath11 considered here .",
    "one gets different values of the initial energy density @xmath10 for different values of the impact parameter @xmath29 and for different geometry of the collision process .",

    "we have evaluated the suppression factor up to @xmath173 gev/@xmath73 .",
    "this gives the maximal possible @xmath11 , @xmath174 , equal to 221.8 mev ( for @xmath175 @xmath164 ) , 226 mev ( for @xmath176 @xmath164 ) or 226.7 mev ( for @xmath166 @xmath164 ) .",
    "this procedure allows to evaluate @xmath0 survival factor given by ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "because of the lack of data , we shall assume only two types of the cross - section , the first , @xmath177 , for @xmath0-baryon scattering and the second , @xmath178 , for @xmath0-meson scattering .",

    "as far as @xmath180 is concerned , we assume that this cross - section is @xmath181 of the corresponding cross section for baryons , which is due to the quark counting . in the following , we will use values of @xmath78 absorption cross - section @xmath182 mb obtained from p - a data @xcite . at the beginning , to illustrate how the value of power @xmath15 influences @xmath0 suppression we present in fig.[fig.1 . ]",
    "two results : the first for @xmath25 ( what is the exact value for a free massless gas ) and the second for @xmath23 ( what is the approximate value for the hadron gas and @xmath183 mev ) .",

    "therefore the realistic @xmath0 survival factor should read      where @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 are given also by formulae ( [ transv]-[15 ] ) but with @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 respectively .",
    "the remaining problem is whether formula ( [ 5 ] ) is valid for @xmath185 and @xmath187 .",
    "there are data for @xmath197 @xcite and they shows that @xmath198 .",
    "so , we assume that the above is also true for @xmath199 , i.e.          should be valid and therefore assume that ( [ pt ] ) is true also in this case .",
    "anyway , the exact form of @xmath203 or @xmath199 is not very important because we checked that the suppression depends on this form very weakly .",
    "first , we put @xmath204 and the resulting @xmath0 survival factor ( for direct @xmath0 s ) differs only a few percent for the highest @xmath70 from the one calculated with formula ( [ 5 ] ) unchanged .",
    "second , when we use expression ( [ 5 ] ) also for @xmath185 and @xmath187 , the evaluated suppression factor is the same as that calculated with the use of ( [ pt ] ) , as far as plots are concerned .    to complete our estimations",
    "we need also values of cross - sections for @xmath205 and @xmath206 scatterings ( we will still hold that @xmath207 cross - section is @xmath208 of @xmath209 cross - section ) .",
    "since @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath185 or @xmath187 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 cross - sections should be greater than @xmath210 one . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that all these cross - sections are equal .",
    "this means that we _",
    "@xmath0 suppression , here .",
    "the final results of calculations of ( [ 13 ] ) are presented in figs.[fig.5.]-[fig.8 . ] for various sets of parameters of our model ( which are @xmath211 ) .",
    "we performed these calculations for two values of @xmath212 mev which agree fairly well with values deduced from hadron yields @xcite .",
    "for comparison , also the experimental data are shown in figs.[fig.5.]-[fig.8 . ] .",
    "the experimental survival factor is defined as      where @xmath214 is the ratio of the @xmath0 to the drell - yan production cross - section in a - b(p - p ) interactions times the branching ratio of the @xmath0 into a muon pair .",
    "the values of the ratio for p - p , s - u and pb - pb are taken from @xcite .",
    "note that since the equality @xmath215 has been confirmed experimentally up to now @xcite , formula ( [ survexp1 ] ) reduces to        coming back to examination of our first results presented in figs.[fig.5.]-[fig.8 . ]",
    ", we can see that we have obtained patterns of suppression which agree with the experimental data fairly well for some values of parameters of our model .",
    "the data prefer @xmath217 mb and ( or ) @xmath12 closer to 100 mev .",
    "note that the dependence on the initial baryon number density is substantial but for higher values of @xmath59 , rather .",
    "the lower the initial baryon number density , the deeper the suppression .",
    "there are two reasons for such a behaviour : the first , for the higher baryon number density , there are less non - strange heavier mesons @xmath218 , @xmath219 in the hadron gas of the same @xmath70 , but these particles create the most weighty fraction of scatters , for which reaction ( [ psiabs ] ) have no threshold at all ; the second , the freeze - out time @xmath56 decreases with increasing @xmath59 for a given @xmath70 in our model .",
    "for instance , for @xmath220 gev/@xmath73 and @xmath21 mev we have @xmath221 and @xmath222 fm for @xmath223 @xmath164 , respectively .",
    "we can see also that the value @xmath224 mb is too small to obtain results comparable with the data , so we will leave aside this value in further investigations .",
    "now we will include the finite - size effects into our model , i.e. we will take into account that the realistic hadron gas has a finite transverse size .",
    "this will be done in form of the rarefaction wave moving inward @xmath123 with the sound velocity @xmath60 . how to obtain this velocity has been mentioned in sec.2 ( see also @xcite )",
    ". with the finite - size effects included , the final expression for @xmath0 survival factor @xmath82 will be given by ( [ 15 ] ) . to make our investigations much more realistic we will also include the possible @xmath0 disintegration in nuclear matter , which should increase @xmath0 suppression by about @xmath225 @xcite . but to draw also s - u data in figures , instead of multiplying @xmath226 by @xmath227 given by ( [ 7 ] ) , we divide @xmath228 by appropriate @xmath227 , i.e. we define `` the experimental @xmath0 hadron gas survival factor '' as        we shall consider the woods - saxon nuclear matter density distribution @xcite , here .",
    "the results of numerical estimations of ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ survgas ] ) are depicted in figs.[fig.9.]-[fig.10 . ] for two values of the charmonium - baryon cross - section @xmath230 mb and the initial baryon number density @xmath231 @xmath164 .",
    "the curves for @xmath232 @xmath164 almost cover the curves for @xmath233 @xmath164 , so for clearness of the figure we do not draw them .",
    "the two values of the speed of sound are the maximal values of this quantity possible in the range @xmath234 mev , @xmath235 $ ] for the above - mentioned two cases of @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , we have checked that the results almost do not depend on @xmath60 allowed in the range .",
    "it has turned out also that in the case of the transverse expansion , the results almost do not depend on the @xmath12 ( for @xmath236 $ ] mev ) .",
    "this is because the freeze - out time resulting from the transverse expansion , @xmath237 ( if we assume a central collision and @xmath60 constant ) , is of the order of the freeze - out time resulting from the longitudinal expansion for @xmath21 mev .",
    "namely , for pb and @xmath238 we have @xmath239 fm , which is very similar to values of @xmath56 for @xmath21 mev given earlier . for @xmath26 mev , @xmath240 fm for @xmath223 @xmath164 respectively , so the hadron gas ceases because of the transverse expansion much earlier .    generally , taking into account",
    "also the transverse expansion changes the final ( theoretical ) pattern of @xmath0 suppression qualitatively .",
    "first of all , the curves for the case including the transverse expansion are not convex , in opposite to the case with the longitudinal expansion only , where the curves are .",
    "but still , theoretical curves do not fall steep enough at high @xmath70 to cover the data area completely . nevertheless , from figs.[fig.9.]-[fig.10 .",
    "] we can see that for some choice of parameters , namely for @xmath177 somewhere between 4 and 5 mb and for @xmath143 fm , we would obtain a quite satisfactory curve . and we should remember that since we have one overall charmonium - baryon cross - section @xmath177 , our final results underestimate the suppression ( for @xmath241 scattering the cross - section should be greater than for @xmath0 ) . to support our conclusion in more visible way we present main results from figs.[fig.9.]-[fig.10 . ] in fig.[fig.11 .",
    "] , where original data @xcite for @xmath242 and @xmath0 survival factors given by ( [ 6 ] ) multiplied by @xmath243 and now as functions of @xmath138 are presented .",
    "the change of the variable from @xmath70 to @xmath138 has been done with the use of ( [ etwound ] ) and @xmath244 expressed by the solid line in fig.[fig.4 . ] .",
    "note that the main disagreement with the data reveals in the last experimental point of the 1998 analysis @xcite ( see figs.[fig.5.]-[fig.11 . ] ) .",
    "but the error bar of this point is very wide . additionally , there is some contradiction in positions of the last three points of the 1998 data .",
    "in fact , the middle point goes up above the left one and the last falls far below the two earlier .",
    "this suggests that more experimental data is needed in the region of high @xmath70 to state definitely whether the abrupt fall of the experimental suppression factor takes place or not there .",
    "now we repeat again the numerical estimations of ( [ 15 ] ) for the case with the finite - size effects and the woods - saxon nuclear matter density distribution included , but for the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath29 given by ( [ etpart ] ) .",
    "the results are presented in figs.[fig.12.]-[fig.13 . ] .",
    "note that the theoretical curves are two - valued around @xmath245 gev/@xmath73 .",
    "this is the result of our approximation of @xmath154 by ( [ etpart ] ) .",
    "this expression allows for two different values of @xmath29 , which give the same @xmath70 in some range of the impact parameter @xmath29 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig.4 . ]",
    "( short - dashed line ) .",
    "we can see that for @xmath246 fm there are two different values @xmath247 and @xmath248 such that @xmath249 .",
    "this causes that results plotted in figs.[fig.12.]-[fig.13 . ]",
    "are qualitatively different from those presented in figs.[fig.9.]-[fig.10 . ] in the region close to the maximal @xmath70 reached at the collision . comparing figs.[fig.9.]-[fig.10 . ] with figs.[fig.12.]-[fig.13 . ]",
    ", we can see also that the pattern of @xmath0 suppression depends on the shape of @xmath70 as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "clarification of this dependence would be very helpful to obtain more realistic picture of the @xmath0 dissociation in hadron medium during the heavy - ion collisions .    as a final remark",
    ", we think that it is difficult to exclude @xmath0 scattering in the hot hadron gas entirely , as the reason for the observed @xmath0 suppression at this point ( see also @xcite ) . in our model",
    "the most crucial parameter is the @xmath250 inelastic cross - section and the final results depend on its value substantially .",
    "therefore it is of the greatest importance to establish how this cross - section behaves in the hot hadron environment .",
    "some work has been done into this direction @xcite , but results presented there differ from each other and are based on different models .",
    "however , the newest estimations of @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 cross - sections at high invariant collision energies @xcite agree with the values of @xmath177 and @xmath178 assumed in our model .",
    "we would like to add also at this point that the @xmath254 inelastic cross - sections have been considered as constant quantities here .",
    "for sure , they should not be constant and the results of just mentioned papers @xcite suggests that they are not , indeed .",
    "they are growing functions of the invariant collision energy @xmath255 .",
    "so , the naive reasoning should direct us to the conclusion that the increase of @xmath70 ( or in other words @xmath138 ) causes the increase of the invariant collision energy @xmath255 on the average and further the increase of the @xmath254 inelastic cross - sections .",
    "this could influence the final patterns of @xmath0 suppression in such a way that @xmath0 survival factor would behave according to the solid curve of fig.[fig.11 . ] for low @xmath70 ( @xmath138 ) but then , as the @xmath254 inelastic cross - sections would increase with @xmath70 ( @xmath138 ) , the factor would go closer to the dashed curve of fig.[fig.11 . ] for high @xmath70 ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "so , the experimental pattern of @xmath0 suppression could be recovered in this way .",
    "therefore , as a final conclusion we can say that it is difficult to ruled out the conventional explanations of @xmath0 suppression completely , at present .",
    "we would like to stress again that the behaviour of the experimental @xmath0 suppression factor at high @xmath138 ( or otherwise at high @xmath70 ) has not been clear yet .",
    "in fact , the abrupt fall of this factor ( what could suggest the appearance of the quark - gluon plasma ) is indicated only by the one point ( the last ) of the 1998 na50 analysis @xcite .",
    "so , to draw a definite conclusion more experimental data far above @xmath256 gev are needed . this region will be reached in upcoming rhic runs and their results should answer the question : is the @xmath0 suppression a signature of the existence of the quark - gluon plasma , or not ? .",
    "_ note added .",
    "_ when our paper was completed we became aware of @xcite where the twin figure ( denoted as fig.5 there ) to our fig.[fig.11 . ] was presented .",
    "but the appearance of the quark - gluon plasma is the main reason for @xmath0 suppression there .",
    "it is also claimed that results shown in that figure `` provide evidence for the production of the quark - gluon plasma in central high - energy pb - pb collisions '' .",
    "this entirely confirms our conclusion that the status of @xmath0 suppression as a signal for the quark - gluon plasma appearance is far from being clear at present .",
