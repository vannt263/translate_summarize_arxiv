    "a new concept - quantum order - was introduced to describe those internal orders.@xcite it turns out that quantum orders provide another origin for gapless excitations .",

    "the psg description carries more information than the symmetry group description since the same symmetry group can have many different extensions .",

    "this result suggests that the gauge fields that govern all the interactions in nature may have their origin in quantum order.@xcite    the relation between the gapless fermions and projective symmetry groups are more complicated .",
    "however , through a study of most general fermion - hopping hamiltonian that is invariant under a psg , one can show that the psg can indeed protect gapless fermions.@xcite we would like to stress that those gapless fermions are not chiral fermions and the gaplessness is not a result of chiral symmetry .",
