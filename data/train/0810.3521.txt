    "in this paper we study the definition of a resonance associated with an avoided crossing .",
    "avoided crossings are quite common in many fields of nuclear , atomic , or molecular physics such as laser driven trapped ions @xcite , two level atoms coupled to a cavity mode @xcite , or diamagnetic hydrogen in magnetic fields @xcite . in the avoided crossing regions , two eigenvalues of the system approach first as a parameter @xmath0 is varied , but then veer from each other .",
    "the `` bare levels '' of a zeroth order hamiltonian do cross at a reference value @xmath1 , but in the full hamiltonian a perturbation connecting them causes the splitting .",
    "the eigenvalues also interchange their character along the avoided crossing : each of the two eigenvalues is dominated by different bare levels before and after the crossing .",
    "the resonance is also characterized by maximal transition probabilities among the bare levels .",
    "as we shall see , however , the central loci of these phenomena do not generically coincide , so different `` shifts '' will be introduced .",
    "the shifts are not only due to the two bare levels directly implied , but to the `` contamination '' or influence of the rest of the levels .",
