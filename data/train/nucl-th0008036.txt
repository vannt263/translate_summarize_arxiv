    "for the understanding of heavy - ion collisions semi - classical transport theory has become an indispensable tool ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical foundation of this approach goes back to the pioneering works on non - equilibrium quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "while former works have focused their attention more or less on the quasi - particle regime ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) the extension of the formalism to off - shell phenomena has become a topic of growing interest in the last few years @xcite since it has been realized that the collision rates present in high energetic nucleus - nucleus collisions typically are so large that an on - shell approximation seems to be inappropriate .",
    "in addition , the resonances excited during the reaction may have large decay widths .",
    "therefore , a representation of these states by stable particles may not be a proper approximation .    the usual approach to solve a transport equation",
    "is the representation of the phase - space density by test - particles @xcite ( concerning off - shell extensions see @xcite ) .",
    "if not only asymptotically stable states but also resonances are simulated by test - particles , one has to attribute a finite life time to those ` resonance test - particles ' , i.e.  one has to demand that they decay after some time of propagation  provided that they had not suffered from a collision prior to their decay .",
    "such resonance test - particles usually have arbitrary invariant masses ( chosen according to their spectral distribution ) . the question which ( in general energy- or mass - dependent ) life time has to be attributed to the resonance test - particles is under present discussion @xcite .",
    "the commonly used recipe is to identify the life time with the inverse decay width of the resonance , evaluated for the respective invariant mass .",
    "near threshold the width thus becomes small due to the available phase - space . hence the life time",
    " if identified with the inverse width  becomes large .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested to rather calculate the life time from the time delay that the particles suffer which form the resonance .",
    "this time delay is given by the energy derivative of the phase shift measured for the particles which scatter by forming the resonance as an intermediate state .",
    "this quantity  and therefore also the life time calculated in this way  vanishes near threshold .",
    "hence the two expressions for the life time show a completely different behavior as functions of the invariant mass of the resonance .",
    "recently a novel approach to the test - particle description of transport processes for states with a continuous mass spectrum has been presented in @xcite . there",
    "the formalism was outlined for a system of non - relativistic ( asymptotically stable ) states subject to elastic collisions . in principle",
    ", however , there is no obstacle to treat also resonances in the same framework and to answer the question about the proper life time for such states . since in principle",
    "the creation and decay of particles is a matter of relativistic field theory we find it more appropriate to present the formalism here for a relativistic system .",
    "one of the goals of @xcite was the derivation of the ( non - relativistic ) equations of motion for the test - particles .",
    "we do not repeat the straightforward generalization for the relativistic case here .",
    "the resulting relativistic equations of motion are given in @xcite for energy - momentum independent self - energies and in @xcite for arbitrary self - energies .",

    "( this was the reason for the choice ( [ eq : wrongchoice ] ) in @xcite . )",

    "this is exactly the essence of relation ( [ eq : taudelta ] ) .",
    "both expressions ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) and ( [ eq : taugamma ] ) are displayed in fig .",

    "the most striking difference is their respective threshold behavior .",
    "while @xmath69 as given in ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) vanishes at threshold , in contrast @xmath58 diverges there as the width vanishes .",
    "in addition , @xmath69 is peaked in the vicinity of the nominal resonance mass .",
    "there @xmath69 is roughly twice as large as @xmath58 .",
    "the latter quantity decreases monotonically in that region . in spite of their completely different shapes ,",
    "it is interesting to realize that there are intuitive interpretations for _ both _ expressions ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) and ( [ eq : taugamma ] ) .",
    "if a resonance with arbitrary invariant mass is considered as a `` real particle '' , it is clear that its life time increases near threshold due to the limited phase - space available for the decay products .",
    "this consideration suggests formula ( [ eq : taugamma ] ) corresponding to the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] . if , however , the resonance is considered as a quantum mechanical transient state the uncertainty principle applies .",
    "hence the more the invariant mass of the resonance deviates from its pole mass the less time it is allowed to live .",
    "qualitatively this is the essence of ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) displayed by the full line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] . clearly",
    "our derivation given above supports the latter interpretation , in spite of the fact that what we are aiming at is the appropriate life time of ( resonance ) test - particles which intuitively are regarded to be closer to real particles than to quantum mechanical states .",
    "nonetheless the transport equation ( [ eq : transport2 ] ) derived from the underlying quantum field theory clearly demands that the appropriate life time is given by ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) instead of ( [ eq : taugamma ] ) .    at this stage",
    "some words of clarification are necessary . for a sharp resonance",
    "it is well - known ( e.g.  @xcite ) that its `` life time '' is given by @xmath70 ( in its rest frame ) which seems to be in line with ( [ eq : taugamma ] ) but in contrast to ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) which roughly yields twice as much ( cf .",
    "[ fig : tau ] ) .",
    "this reasoning , however , is misleading . in the preceding paragraphs we studied the life time @xmath69 of a resonance with arbitrary invariant mass .",
    "in contrast , the well - known `` life time '' @xmath71 of a sharp resonance is a quantity averaged over the allowed energy ( or invariant mass ) range . as we shall see now both expressions ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) and ( [ eq : taugamma ] ) , albeit completely different in shape ,",
    "yield the same average value , if the width is sufficiently small .",
    "the natural choice for the probability ( density ) to find a resonance with energy @xmath72 is given by the spectral function ( [ eq : defspec ] ) .",
    "recalling the normalization ( [ eq : norm ] ) we define @xmath73 to evaluate this average for both expressions ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) and ( [ eq : taugamma ] ) we restrict ourselves to the case of small width , i.e.  a sharply peaked resonance . in this case",
    "we can neglect any energy dependence of the width and simply evaluate it at the pole mass : @xmath74 with @xmath75 . for simplicity we also neglect the real part of the retarded self - energy . as already pointed out in @xcite",
    "the following relations hold ( translated here to a relativistic system ) : @xmath76 hence we find for the expression ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) @xmath77 we get the same result using ( [ eq : taugamma ] ) @xmath78 in the rest frame of the resonance this reduces to the well - known expression baryon displayed in the figures with its quite sizable on - shell width of @xmath79mev the average values in ( [ eq : tauav2 ] ) and ( [ eq : tauav3 ] ) do not deviate much from each other : @xmath80fm / c , @xmath81fm / c , @xmath82fm / c . ]",
    "@xmath83 note , however , that this relation provides only an average value of the life time .",
    "it does not answer the question how long a resonance with arbitrary invariant mass lives .    concerning practical applications ,",
    "i.e.  transport simulations with test - particles , the previous considerations suggest the following two possibilities for states with a small width :    * one might represent @xmath43 by test - particles having arbitrary invariant masses . for small width",
    "the likelihood to produce a test - particle with a mass far away from the pole mass is of course negligibly small .",
    "therefore basically all test - particles will have similar ( but not exactly the same ) invariant masses .",
    "the life time of a test - particle is given by ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) .",
    "* the second possibility is to attribute the on - shell mass to all test - particles . in this case",
    "the test - particles represent the integrated quantity @xmath84 instead of @xmath43 .",
    "consequently all test - particles have to decay with the same integrated ( averaged ) life time @xmath85 .",
    "obviously , concerning states with a large width only the first possibility is reasonable . from a practical point of view a word of caution",
    "is necessary . to realize the first possibility one has to make sure that one has chosen enough test - particles to `` fill out '' the whole spectral distribution",
    "especially , if the test - particles in the tails of the spectral distribution are missing one might obtain an average life time which is too high since ( cf .",
    "[ fig : tau ] ) @xmath86 hence for states with a small width the second possibility described above seems to be more practical .",
    "it is worth to discuss the role of the factor @xmath87 in the expression for the life time ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) . due to the contribution ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : defk ] ) ) @xmath88 @xmath89 diverges at threshold , i.e.  where @xmath15 vanishes .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kfac ] .",
    "we also deduce from that figure that @xmath87 remains positive for all values of @xmath90 .",
    "this is a necessary consistency condition since the life time and also the effective particle number density ( [ eq : defskleff ] ) should not become negative ( cf .  the corresponding discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : tausimple ] we compare the life time @xmath69 from ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) with the simpler quantity @xmath91 . as can be seen the main effect of @xmath87 on @xmath69 is to change the threshold behavior of the spectral function for the @xmath13 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : gamdelta],[eq : defbeta ] ) ) @xmath92 to @xmath93 this explains the kink of @xmath69 at threshold as compared to the smooth rising of the spectral function . in total , however , @xmath69 and @xmath91 look rather similar , especially if compared to the completely different shape of @xmath58 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] .",
    "we now turn to an extension of the formalism applicable when there exists more than one decay channel for the resonance .",
    "while the _ total _ life time is given by ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) it is also important to know the _ partial _ decay rates ( inverse life times ) for the various channels .",
    "formally this can be accounted for by realizing that @xmath94 is given by a sum of the self - energies corresponding to the different decay channels : @xmath95 the latter equality makes sense if there are no production channels , i.e.  @xmath96 .",
    "now it is straightforward to deduce from ( [ eq : timeevsimple ] ) the evolution equation @xmath97 with the partial life times @xmath98 where we have attributed the index `` tot '' to all expressions calculated earlier to distinguish them from the expressions belonging to a single one of the decay channels .",
    "we note in passing that the probability for the resonance to decay into channel @xmath99 ( branching ratio ) agrees with the probability that one would deduce from ( [ eq : taugamma ] ) : @xmath100      so far , we have restricted our considerations to resonance decays in vacuum neglecting the production channels encoded in @xmath101 .",
    "if we want to study creation and decay of resonances in a medium , we have to take both loss and gain terms , i.e.  the full r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : transport2 ] ) into account . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the in general rather lengthy l.h.s .  of ( [ eq : transport2 ] ) which describes the propagation of the test - particles according to drift term , vlasov term , etc .",
    "for our purposes it is enough to study the simplified evolution equation @xmath102 in general , @xmath103 and @xmath48 are connected by detailed balance . for the case of thermal equilibrium",
    "this leads to the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) boundary condition ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath104 to simplify the discussion and to get a closer relation to the life time introduced above we assume in the following @xmath105 ( concerning the thermal state we turn from a bose to a boltzmann distribution ) . using ( [ eq : defwidth ] )",
    "we find @xmath106 the kms - condition ( detailed balance ) becomes @xmath107 while ( [ eq : transport3 ] ) simplifies to @xmath108 where we have replaced @xmath109 as defined in ( [ eq : bose ] ) by 1 .",
    "hence we deduce that the effective loss rate is given by @xmath110 while the gain rate is @xmath111 . however , since @xmath112 and not @xmath110 is connected to @xmath111 by detailed balance ( [ eq : boltz2 ] ) one might worry about the correct thermal limit for the particle number density . thermal equilibrium ,",
    "i.e.  a stationary solution for @xmath43 is reached if gain and loss terms cancel each other : @xmath113 using the definition of the life time ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) and the ( simplified ) kms - condition ( [ eq : boltz2 ] ) we end up with @xmath114 where we have replaced the boltzmann by the bose function in the last step . ) together with the exact kms - condition ( [ eq : heat ] ) would have led immediately to the last expression of ( [ eq : boltz3 ] ) .",
    "we made the approximations only to get closer contact to the expression for the life time .",

    "hence we have shown that the combination of loss and gain terms on the r.h.s .",
    "of the transport equation ( [ eq : transport2 ] ) indeed yields the correct thermal limit for the effective particle number density @xmath36 .",
    "turning the argument around we conclude that attributing the life time ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) to a resonance only leads to thermodynamically consistent results if one realizes that the appropriate ( effective ) particle number density is given by @xmath36 introduced in ( [ eq : defskleff ] ) and _ not _ by @xmath42 . assuming erroneously that the test - particles which decay according to ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) represent",

    "we have pointed out ( repeating the arguments of @xcite ) that the proper quantity which should be simulated by test - particles , i.e.  which counts the test - particles per four - momentum and space volume , is given by the effective particle number density @xmath36 introduced in ( [ eq : defskleff ] ) . once",
    "this identification has been made it was straightforward to derive from the transport equation ( [ eq : transport2 ] ) the life time of the resonance test - particles .",
    "for the vacuum case we obtained expression ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) which can be rewritten as ( [ eq : taudelta ] ) confirming the result of danielewicz and pratt @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",

    "this phrase merely denotes a concept than a single particle , namely the concept that `` off - shell test - particles '' fill the generalized phase - space of _ four_-momentum and coordinate space ( weighted by their spectral distribution ) .",
    "in contrast `` on - shell test - particles '' live in usual phase - space .",
    "while `` off - shell test - particles '' represent @xmath24 `` on - shell test - particles '' represent @xmath118 .",
    "these concepts are also discussed at page ( items 1 .  and 2 . ) . ]",
    "have to be modified to account for the fact that these test - particles represent the effective particle number density @xmath36 and not @xmath42 .",
    "there are rather simple rules for the required modification :    * for each incoming off - shell test - particle the cross section has to be divided by @xmath119 where all quantities refer to the ( in - medium ) properties of the off - shell test - particle , i.e.  @xmath15 is its total ( in - medium ) width etc .",
    "* for each outgoing off - shell test - particle the pauli blocking / bose enhancement factor is given by ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : bose ] ) ) @xmath120    in the same way the result for the life time can be understood : in complete analogy to the cross section the decay width @xmath121 has to be divided by ( [ eq : renormf ] ) . in that way the inverse of that quantity changes from @xmath122 to ( [ eq : partlifetime ] ) which is our expression for the life time .",
    "whether these new rules for the calculation of cross sections and decay probabilities lead to observable effects in nucleus - nucleus collisions remains to be seen .",
    "i acknowledge fruitful discussions with j.  aichelin , v.  koch , and u.  mosel during the `` hirschegg 2000 '' workshop .",
    "these discussions initiated the work presented here .",
    "i also thank w.  cassing , c.  greiner , and s.  juchem for their helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "to exemplify the formulae given above we study a toy model for the @xmath13 resonance where spin ( and also isospin ) is neglected for simplicity .",
    "the width is determined by the @xmath123 decay channel : @xmath124 with @xmath125 here the momentum @xmath126 of @xmath127 and @xmath128 in the rest frame of the decaying @xmath13 resonance with invariant mass @xmath129 is given by @xmath130^{1/2 } \\over 2 \\sqrt{s } }   \\,.\\ ] ] in ( [ eq : defbeta ] ) we have included a blatt - weisskopf function @xcite parametrized by the length parameter @xmath131 .",
    "we adopt the following values to simulate the vacuum decay properties of the @xmath13 resonance : @xmath132mev , @xmath133mev , @xmath134mev , @xmath135mev , and @xmath136fm .",
    "since @xmath14 becomes constant for large energies the real part of the retarded self - energy can be calculated by a one - time subtracted dispersion relation according to ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) .",
    "we choose the subtraction constant such that the real part of the self - energy vanishes for @xmath137 . in our simple vacuum model the energy integration in ( [ eq : dispersion ] )",
    "can be rewritten in terms of the invariant mass squared .",
