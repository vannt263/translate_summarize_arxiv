    "it is possible to observe quantum effects in such objects , provided that they are cooled to temperatures @xmath1 such that @xmath2 is near or slightly above @xmath3@xcite . for a realistic nmo frequency of 500 mhz",

    ", we numerically analyze energy loss by a nmo capacitively coupled to a dissipative cooper pair box ( cpb ) .",
    "a cpb consists of a small josephson junction whose josephson energy is much smaller than its charging energy , and which is voltage - biased so that only the two lowest energy levels are experimentally accessible .",
    "et al._@xcite have recently suggested that an nmo could be cooled by capacitively coupling it to a cpb . in the present work , we numerically demonstrate an increased rate of energy loss by this mechanism , by solving a time - dependent schrdinger equation with a stochastic term .",
    "we also relate the rate of energy loss to the coupling constant and the nmo and cpb damping rates .",
    "several studies of the coupled nmo / cpb system have already been carried out@xcite , as have studies of the formally similar system consisting of a cpb couplied to a single - mode electromagnetic cavity@xcite .",
    "if both the cpb and the cavity are dissipative , this system is closely analogous to the one studied here@xcite .",
    "dissipation in quantum systems was treated by caldeira and leggett , who studied the suppression of quantum tunneling out of a metastable state by dissipation@xcite .",

    "_ studied the dynamics of a dissipative tls @xcite . in both of these approaches ,",
    "the dissipation is treated as arising from coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "an alternative method starts from lindblad s quantum - mechanical master equation for the density operator of an open system@xcite .",
    "an equivalent approach is to start from a pure - state schrdinger equation , which contains a stochastic term to represent the effect of dissipation@xcite . here",
    ", we use this approach to treat energy loss by an nmo coupled to a cpb .",

    "moreover , in this coordinate system , the two eigenstates of @xmath32 represent symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of charge states .",
    "in addition , we will make the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) to obtain the hamiltonian used in all our calculations .",
    "this hamiltonian is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , we neglect the counterrotating terms @xmath36 if @xmath37 and the coupling is sufficiently weak , the rwa is believed justified @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "we believe that the rwa is also reasonable when the two damping terms are included .",
    "we include dissipation in both the cpb and the nmo by using a stochastic time - dependent schrdinger equation .",

    "we include only the two lindblad operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which represent dissipation within the nmo and the cpb .",
    "the inclusion of only these two lindblad operators is appropriate if @xmath1 is sufficiently low ( typically @xmath45 ) , and if other dissipative processes can be neglected .",

    "the price paid is that the differential equations are stochastic , and thus must be averaged over many realizations .",

    "thus , we use this stochastic approach in the following .    to see how this procedure can lead to faster energy loss by the nmo ,",

    "( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "several experimental methods for preparing an nmo in a specified fock state have been proposed @xcite .",
    "we have solved eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) at resonance for different values of @xmath67 and @xmath26 , using the value @xmath68 , by straightforward euler integration , using a time step @xmath69ns@xmath70 . from these solutions , we compute various averages of interest , such as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , as functions of time @xmath63 . the triangular brackets and overbars denote quantum - mechanical and noise averages , respectively . for conciseness",
    ", we denote these quantities simply @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the results are averaged over 100 realizations of the noise , which appear sufficient to give reasonably smooth results .",
    "we carry out calculations assuming @xmath75 mhz , @xmath76 mhz , @xmath77 ( ns)@xmath78and @xmath79 ( ns)@xmath78 . these values of @xmath67 and @xmath26 correspond to decay times of the uncoupled nmo and cpb of 2000 ns ( corresponding to a @xmath24 factor of @xmath80 ) and 20 ns , respectively , as used in ref .",
    "a much larger decay time for the cpb has been achieved in some more recent experiments ( see , e.  g. , wallraff _ et al._@xcite , who find an energy relaxation rate of around 7@xmath81sec )",
    ". however , one does not want such a long decay time for the cpb , since this will reduce the rate at which the nmo loses energy when coupled to the cpb .",
    "we have , therefore , carried out our calculations using the original parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first carried out calculations of the uncoupled cpb and nmo , using the stochastic schrdinger equation , starting from the state @xmath82 . in this case , the cpb and nmo each decay exponentially with decay rates 20 ( ns)@xmath78 and 2000 ( ns)@xmath78 , respectively , as shown in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "next , we turned on the coupling @xmath83 , so that @xmath76 mhz , with results shown in figs .  1 and 2 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we now discuss the results . in both cases ,",
    "we use @xmath84 of the nmo , as in experiment@xcite . fig .",
    "1 shows that , in the presence of coupling , the decay rate of the cpb is substantially reduced , relative to the uncoupled cpb .",
    "the reduction in the decay rate is greatest when the damping in the nmo is smallest . besides this reduction in decay rate , fig .",
    "1 shows the expected rabi oscillations in @xmath85 for all three calculations involving nonzero @xmath83 .",
    "these rabi oscillations , of frequency @xmath86@xcite , occur between the states @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "they are the well - known results of solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the present hamiltonian in the _ absence _ of dissipation ; our calculations show that they still occur with dissipation present .",
    "by contrast , fig .",
    "2 shows that , when the coupling is turned on , the decay rate of the nmo is _ increased _ relative to that of the uncoupled nmo .",
    "furthermore , the decay rate is the largest when the damping rate of the cpb is largest .",
    "once again , we see rabi oscillations in @xmath74 .    the results of both figs .",
    "1 and 2 can be understood qualitatively when @xmath84 .",
    "the coupling allows energy to be transferred periodically between the cpb and the nmo .",
    "since the nmo has a much lower decay rate than that of the cpb , this new channel should reduce the effective decay rate of the cpb , as we observed numerically .",
    "similarly , this transfer should _ increase _ the effective damping rate of the nmo , again as seen numerically .",
    "furthermore as the damping rate @xmath26 of the cpb increases , the effective damping rate of the nmo should also increase , again as seen numerically .    finally , in fig .  3 ,",
    "we show how this behavior depends on the assumed initial fock state of the nmo . in the three cases shown",
    ", we start from state @xmath89 with four different initial fock states , @xmath90 , of the nmo .",
    "@xmath91 decays roughly exponentially with time , with superimposed rabi oscillations .",
    "the exponential decay rate is consideably smaller for @xmath92 than for the other cases .",
    "this difference occurs , we believe , because , in the absence of damping , the coupling between the cpb and nmo is proportional @xmath93 ( this is the splitting between states @xmath89 and @xmath88 in the rwa in the absence of damping ) .",
    "we now discuss the possible relation between the present results and energy loss by a real nmo .",
    "we have considered the time - dependent nmo / cpb system , starting from the state @xmath87 .",
    "our approach permits us to calculate the time needed for the nmo , starting from this excited state , to approach its equilibrium temperature , given that the intrinsic damping within the nmo is very small . if the nmo is coupled to a much more heavily damped cpb , we find that the equilibration process is greatly speeded up",
    ". this result might be useful in designing ways of rapidly equilibrating an nmo , initially in an excited state , to a low ambient temperature .",
    "we also find that the rate of equilibration of the cpb is _ reduced _ when it is coupled to an nmo .",
    "our results are consistent with those of trees _",
    "et al._@xcite , who used a very different approach .",
    "these workers studied a current - biased josephson junction capacitively coupled to an oscillator , in the presence of dissipation , using the formalism of caldeira and leggett@xcite , and found that the cpb is less damped when it is coupled to an nmo .",
    "our results show the same behavior , using a formally quite different stochastic differential equation .",
    "we also find an additional result , not shown in ref .",
    "@xcite : for a given coupling constant , the cpb is damped most slowly when the damping of the nmo is smallest ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "it should also be pointed out that we have included only two lindblad operators in our calculation , namely , those involving the constants @xmath67 and @xmath26 .",
    "other lindblad operators could readily be included , such as ones describing finite temperature and pure dephasing@xcite . in the present calculation , @xmath67 and @xmath26",
    "parametrize energy loss from the nmo and the cpb to their thermal environments .",
    "another point is that the regime we have considered , in which the cpb is more heavily damped than the nmo , is not necessarily the regime in which a cpb is typically studied .",
    "when one wishes to use the cpb as an element in a quantum computing geometry , it is usually desirable to have a cpb with as little dissipation , and as long a decoherence time , as possible . in the present work , by contrast , we are envisioning a setup where the cpb is being used as a means of rapidly extracting energy from a high - q nmo , so as to observe the expected quantum effects in the nmo .",
    "as shown by our calculations , this requires a cpb which is more heavily damped than the nmo .",
    "finally , we should note that our calculation is applicable , in principle , to energy loss by any harmonic oscillator mode coupled to any two - level system , provided that the model hamiltonian describing the interactions and energy losses is that used in the present work .",
    "next , we briefly comment on the initial conditions used in these calculations .",
    "we have assumed that the nmo begins in a fock state . in some cases",
    ", a more appropriate initial condition might be one in which the initial state of the oscillator is a mixture of fock states weighted according to a suitable temperature .",
    "if this calculation were carried out , it might represent a study of the rate of cooling of an nmo , initially at some temperature @xmath1 , if it were placed in a thermal bath at a much lower temperature and also coupled to an nmo at a similarly lower temperature .",
    "another possible initial state might be a coherent state of the oscillator , i.  e. , an eigenstate of @xmath94 .",
    "both initial states may be achievable experimentally .",
    "calculations starting from such mixed states would be more demanding numerically , using the present approach , but will probably lead to qualitatively similar results regarding the rate of energy loss of both the nmo and the cpb .",
    "finally , we comment on our use of the rwa .",
    "the rwa is believed justified when the coupling between the nmo and cpb is reasonably small , compared to @xmath95 , and also provided the nmo and cpb are in resonance .",
    "both conditions are satisfied in the present calculation .",
    "we have carried out similar rwa calculations off resonance , with results similar to those shown in figs .  1 - 3 , but we believe that the rwa approximation is less accurate in this case . to go beyond the rwa leads to a considerably more complicated set of stochastic differential equations . to confirm our results , we have , in fact , gone beyond the rwa for the parameters used in the calculations discussed above ( nmo and cpb in resonance , relatively weak coupling ) , solving eqs .",
    "( 7 ) including all the counterrotating terms . in this case",
    ", it proves more convenient to solve numerically for @xmath96|\\psi\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath21 is given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) , then transform back to get @xmath53 .",
    "the resulting time dependent averages , for these parameters , are nearly indistinguishable from those shown in figs .  1 - 3 , showing that the rwa is indeed an excellent approximation , as expected , for this case . for substantially stronger coupling between the nmo and the cpb , or for frequencies far off resonance , we have not yet succeeded in obtaining a converged solution for @xmath97 when the counterrotating terms are included , showing that , once again as expected , the rwa is inaccurate in this regime .    to summarize ,",
    "we have demonstrated , within the rwa , and using a suitable time - dependent schrdinger equation with stochastic terms , that the rate of equilibration of an nmo with a thermal bath can be considerably speeded up by coupling the nmo to a cpb . using the same approach , we have demonstrated that the decay rate of the cpb can be easily reduced by coupling it to a high @xmath24 factor cavity , such as a nanomechanical oscillator ; this latter result is consistent with previous calculations@xcite using a very different approach .",
    "both of these effects may be very useful experimentally .",
    "in particular , the use of a cpb as a means of removing energy from an nmo may be helpful in observing macroscopic quantum effects in such oscillators .",
    "this work has been supported by the nsf , through grant dmr-04 - 13395 , and also benefited from the facilities of the ohio supercomputer center .",
    "we thank professor b.  r.  trees for valuable conversations .                                                 versus time @xmath63 ,",
