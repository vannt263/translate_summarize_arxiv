    "for this reason both of these models can be regarded as theories of gaussian discrete two dimensional fermi field .",
    "the ising model was solved by onsager and for dimer models the pfaffian solution was found by kasteleyn .    the @xmath0-vertex model , a particular case of which is the ice model is interesting for a number of reasons . physically , it is a model of ferro- and antiferro- electricity .",
    "it has many equivalent reformulations , one of them ( which we will use ) describe the 6-vertex configurations on a planar connected simply connected region in terms of stepped surfaces .",
    "one of the combinatorial reformulations of the 6-vertex model for specific value of parameters @xcite is related to alternating sign matrices @xcite .",
    "the 6-vertex model generalizes dimer models and can be regraded as the theory of gaussian discrete fermions with four fermionic interaction .",
    "the partition function of the 6-vertex model with periodic boundary conditions was computed in @xcite using the bethe ansatz method .",
    "the computation of correlation functions in the @xmath0-vertex model is highly non - trivial and to the large degree is still a challenge .",
    "there are two known approaches to this problem based on the internal symmetry of the model , i.e. on the representation theory of quantum affine algebras .",
    "first approach is based on determinantal formulae for certain matrix elements @xcite .",
    "for some recent results based on this method see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second approach is based on form - factor formulae derived in @xcite . for an overview of this approach see @xcite and for the latest results see @xcite .    the 6-vertex model on a planar",
    "simply regions can be reformulated as the theory of random stepped surfaces .",
    "a configuration of arrows in a 6-vertex model can be interpreted as a configuration of paths which can be viewed as level corves of a _ height function _ defining a stepped surface .",

    "it means that on macroscopical scale the random surface becomes deterministic .",
    "the fluctuations remain at smaller scale and the structure of fluctuations may change depending on how singular the limit shape is at this point . the limit shape phenomenon is studied in details in dimer models @xcite .",
    "the numerical results from @xcite@xcite show how limit shapes develop in a 6-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the limit shape phenomenon for the 6-vertex model on a planar connected simply connected regions with fixed boundary conditions .",
    "computing the limit shape involves two steps .",
    "step one is the derivation of the formula for the free energy of the 6-vertex model as a function of magnetic fields . unlike the partition function of dimer models",
    ", the free energy can not be computed explicitly .",
    "however , it can be written in terms of the solution to a linear integral equation .",
    "many analytical properties of the partition function are known but scattered in the literature , see for example @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we collected most of them in the section [ f - energy ] together with some new results .",
    "step two is to derive and solve the variational principle which determine the limit shape for given boundary conditions .",
    "the free energy of the model as a function of magnetic fields determine the functional in the variational problem .",
    "such variational problem was first introduced for dimer models in @xcite .",
    "the idea of using this variational problem in the 6-vertex first appeared in @xcite where some interesting partial results were obtained for correlation functions in the bulk of the limit shape .",
    "the structure of fluctuations near the limit shape is determined by the asymptotical behavior of correlation functions at smaller scales .",
    "we will discuss this problem for the 6-vertex model in the last section .",
    "finally let us mention the special case of domain wall boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions first appeared in the computation of norms of bethe vectors @xcite .",
    "the remarkable fact about them is that the partition function of the 6-vertex model with these boundary conditions can be written as a determinant @xcite .",
    "another remarkable fact is that exactly these boundary conditions relate the 6-vertex model with alternating sign matrices @xcite .",
    "the large volume asymptotic of the partition function of the 6-vertex mode with these boundary conditions was computed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "here is the outline of the paper . in the first two sections we recall some basic facts about the @xmath0-vertex model , about its reformulation it in terms of height functions , and about the thermodynamical limit in the model .",
    "the third section contains the description of the free energy per site for as the function of electric fields in thermodynamical limit for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "some asymptotical behaviors of the free energy are computed in section 4 .",

    "each configuration of arrows on the lattice can be equivalently described as the configuration of `` thin '' and `` thick '' edges or empty and occupied edges shown on fig .",
    "[ vertices ] .",
    "there should be an even number of thick edges at each vertex as a consequence of the ice rule .",
    "the thick edges form paths .",
    "we assume that paths do not intersect ( two paths may meet at an @xmath9-vertex ) .",
    "so , equivalently , configurations of the @xmath0-vertex model can be regarded as configurations of paths satisfying the rules from fig .",
    "[ vertices ] .    to each configuration of arrows on edges adjacent to a vertex we assign a boltzmann weight , which we denote by the same letters .",
    "the physical meaning of a boltzmann weight is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the energy of a state and @xmath12 is the temperature ( in the appropriate units ) .",

    "we set @xmath25 because for the types of boundary conditions we will consider the difference between the number of @xmath16-vertices and @xmath17 vertices is the same for all states and , therefore , the probability does not depend on the ratio @xmath26 .",
    "we also use the standard notation @xmath27 these are the weights of the model when there is no magnetic field .    the weight of a state is the product of weights of vertices in the state .",
    "the weight of a state on @xmath28 ( up to a constant factor ) can be written in terms of energies and magnetic fields as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total number of @xmath31-vertices , @xmath32 is the total number of @xmath33-vertices , @xmath34 is the total number of @xmath35-vertices , @xmath36 is the total number of horizontal edges occupied by paths , and @xmath37 is the total number of vertical edges occupied by paths .",

    "states in the 6-vertex with the same configurations of arrows on the boundary are called states with _ fixed",

    "the difference between two such states can occur only at inner edges .    the space of states with fixed boundary conditions is empty unless the boundary values satisfy the ice rule : the total number of incoming arrows on the boundary edges should be equal to the total number of outgoing arrows . in the path formulation",
    "this means that the number of paths through north and west boundaries should be equal to the number paths through the south and east boundaries .",
    "an example of such boundary conditions is the domain wall ( dw ) boundary conditions . for the dw boundary conditions the arrows on the boundary of the lattice are going into the lattice at the top and bottom of the lattice and are going out of the lattice at the right and left of it .",

    "the @xmath0-vertex model with periodic boundary conditions is an example of an `` integrable '' ( solvable ) model in statistical mechanics and has been studied extensively , see @xcite,@xcite and references therein . in particular , it means that the row - to - row transfer - matrix of the model can be diagonalized by the bethe ansatz .      by _ outer faces _ we mean unit squares centered at @xmath49 , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",

    "[ hf_example ] .",

    "it is clear that there is a unique height function whose level curves are these paths and which satisfies the condition @xmath64 at the southwest corner .",

    "* the 6-vertex model is closely related to the representation theory of quantized universal enveloping algebra of @xmath525 .",
