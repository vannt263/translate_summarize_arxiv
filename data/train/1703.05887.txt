    "microlensing is sensitive to planets orbiting low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ( bds ) that are difficult to detect by other methods , such as the radial velocity and transit method .",
    "although faint low - mass stars such as m dwarfs comprise @xmath11 of stars in the solar neighborhood and the galaxy @xcite , it is difficult to detect distant m dwarfs due to their low luminosity .",
    "however , microlensing depends on the mass of the lens , not the luminosity , and thus it is not affected by the distance and luminosity of the lens .",
    "hence , microlensing is the best method to probe faint m dwarfs in the galaxy . a majority of host stars of 52 extrasolar planets detected by microlensing are m dwarfs , and they are distributed within a wide range of distances about @xmath12 .    until now",
    "a large number of bds @xcite have been discovered by various methods including radial velocity @xcite , transit @xcite , and direct imaging @xcite , and most of them are young @xcite .",
    "there exist various scenarios of bd formation based on these plentiful bd samples .",
    "since microlensing provides different bd samples from other methods , the microlensing bd samples will play an important role to constrain the various bd formation scenarios .",
    "17 bds have been detected with microlensing so far .",
    "only two of them , ogle-2007-blg-224l @xcite and ogle-2015-blg-1268l @xcite , are isolated bds , while most of the others , ogle-2006-blg-277 lb @xcite , ogle-2008-blg-510lb",
    "/ moa-2008-blg-369l @xcite , moa-2009-blg-411 lb @xcite , moa-2010-blg-073 lb @xcite , moa-2011-blg-104lb / ogle-2011-blg-0172 @xcite , moa-2011-blg-149 lb @xcite , ogle-2013-blg-0102 lb @xcite , and ogle-2013-blg-0578 lb @xcite , are binary companions orbiting m dwarf stars .",
    "this is because binary lens events ( i.e. , events with anomalies in the light curve ) have a larger chance to measure masses of the lens than single lens events , such as isolated bd events .",
    "the key problem in  detecting \" isolated bds is that in general , we do not know whether they are  detected \" or not , since all that we obtain from observed events is the einstein timescale @xmath13 , which is the crossing time of the einstein radius of the lens . with the observed @xmath13",
    ", we can only make a very rough estimate of the lens mass and so can not distinguish potential bds from stars . to measure the masses of isolated bds in the isolated bds events ,",
    "two parameters are required : the angular einstein radius @xmath14 and microlens parallax @xmath15 .",
    "this is because @xcite @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the lens mass , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the distances to the lens and the source from the observer , respectively .",
    "however , it is usually quite difficult to measure the two parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    in general , @xmath14 is obtained from the measurement of the normalized source radius @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an angular radius of the source .",
    "the @xmath6 measurement is limited to well - covered caustic - crossing events and high - magnification events in which the source passes close to the lens , while @xmath23 is usually well measured through the color and brightness of the source . because isolated bd events are almost always quite short , @xmath15 can usually be measured only via so - called terrestrial parallax @xcite .",
    "terrestrial parallax measurements are limited to well - covered high - magnification events . as a result",
    ", it is very hard to measure masses of isolated bds from the ground @xcite . the best way to measure",
    "@xmath15 is a simultaneous observation of an event from earth and a satellite @xcite .",
    "fortunately , since 2014 , the _ spitzer _ satellite has been regularly observing microlensing events toward the galactic bulge in order to measure the microlens parallax .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "observations suggest a new opportunity to obtain the mass function of bds from the simultaneous observation from earth and _ spitzer _ , although they are not dedicated to bds @xcite .    the simultaneous observation from the two observatories with sufficiently wide projected separation @xmath24 allows to measure the microlens parallax vector @xmath25 from the difference in the light curves as seen from the two observatories , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the lens - source relative proper motion and @xmath28 where @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the time of the closest source approach to the lens ( peak time of the event ) and @xmath31 is the separation between the lens and the source at time @xmath30 ( impact parameter ) .",
    "the subscripts of @xmath32 and @xmath33 indicate the parameters as measured from the satellite and earth , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the difference in @xmath30 and @xmath31 as measured from the two observatories .",
    "parallax measurements made by such comparisons between the light curves are subject to a well - known four - fold degeneracy , which comes from four possible values of @xmath35 including ( @xmath36 ) and ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "however , there is only a two - fold degeneracy in the amplitude of @xmath25 because @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the only exception to the four - fold degeneracy would be if one of the two observatories has @xmath31 consistent with zero , while the other has @xmath31 inconsistent with zero . in this case",
    ", the four - fold degeneracy reduces to a two - fold degeneracy .",
    "for example , if @xmath40 ( within errors ) , then @xmath41 ( and similarly for @xmath42 ) .",
    "then , since @xmath43 , there is no degeneracy in the mass ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this case is very important for point - lens mass measurements since the lens always passes very close to or over the source as seen by one observatory , so @xmath44 , whether or not it is strictly consistent with zero .    here",
    "we report the fifth isolated - star measurement derived from microlensing measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast to the previous four measurements , this one has a discrete degeneracy in @xmath6 and therefore in mass .",
    "we trace the origin of this degeneracy to the fact that only a single point is affected by finite - source effects , and we argue that it may occur frequently in future space - based microlensing mass measurements , including bds .",
    "we show how this degeneracy can be broken by future high - resolution imaging , regardless of whether the lens is dark or luminous .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the observation of the event ogle-2015-blg-1482 is summarized , and we describe the analysis of the light curve in section 3 . with the results of section 3 , we derive physical properties of the source and lens in section 4 and then we discuss the results in section 5 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 6 .",
    "the gravitational microlensing event ogle-2015-blg-1482 was discovered by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) ( udalski 2003 ) , and it was also observed by _ spitzer _ and korea microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet , @xcite ) .",
    "the microlensed source star of the event is located at ( @xmath45,@xmath46 ) = ( @xmath47 ) in equatorial coordinates and ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) = ( @xmath50 ) in galactic coordinates .",
    "ogle observations were carried out using a 1.3 m warsaw telescope with a field of view of 1.4 square degrees at the las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "the event lies in the ogle field blg534 with a cadence of about @xmath51 in @xmath52 band .",
    "the einstein timescale is quite short , @xmath53days , and the ogle baseline of this event is slightly variable on long timescales at about the 0.02 mag level .",
    "thus , we used only 2015 season data for light curve modeling .",
    "kmtnet observations were conducted using 1.6 m telescopes with fields of view of 4.0 square degrees at each of three different sites , cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile , the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) in south africa , and siding spring observatory ( sso ) in australia .",
    "the scientific observations at the ctio , saao , and sso were initiated on 3 february , 19 february , and 6 june in 2015 , respectively .",
    "ogle-2015-blg-1482 was observed with @xmath54 minute cadence at the three sites and the exposure time was 60 s. the ctio , saao , and sso observations were made in @xmath52-band filter , and for determining the color of the source star , the ctio observations with a typical good seeing were also made in @xmath55-band filter .",
    "thus , the light curve of the event was well covered by the three kmtnet observation data sets .",
    "the kmtnet data were reduced by the difference image analysis ( dia ) photometry pipeline @xcite .      _",
    "spitzer _ observations in 2015 were carried out under an 832-hour program whose principal scientific goal was to measure the galactic distribution of planets @xcite . the event selection and observational cadences",
    "were decided strictly by the protocols of @xcite , according to which events could be selected either  subjectively \" or  objectively \" .",
    "events that meet specified objective criteria _ must _ be observed according to a specified cadence . in this case",
    "all planets discovered , whether before or after _ spitzer _ observations are triggered , ( as well as all planet sensitivity ) can be included in the analysis .",
    "events that do not meet these criteria can still be chosen  subjectively \" . in this case ,",
    "planets ( and planet sensitivity ) can only be included in the galactic - distribution analysis based on data that become available after the decision . like objective events",
    ", events selected subjectively must continue to be observed according to the specified cadence and stopping criteria ( although those may be specified as different from the standard , objective values at the time of selection ) .    because the current paper is not about planets or planet sensitivities , the above considerations play no direct role .",
    "however , they play a crucial indirect role .",
    "figure 1 shows that despite the event s very short timescale @xmath53days , and despite the fact that it peaked as seen from _",
    "slightly before it peaked from earth , observations began about 1 day prior to the peak .",
    "this is remarkable because , as discussed in detail by @xcite ( see their figure 1 ) , there is a delay between the selection of a target and the start of the _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "targets can only be uploaded to the spacecraft once per week , and it takes some time to prepare the target uploads . therefore , _ spitzer _",
    "observations begin a minimum of three days after the final decision is made to observe the event with _ spitzer _ , and that decision is generally based on data taken the night before , i.e. about four days prior to the first _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "hence , at the time that the decision was made to observe ogle-2015-blg-1482 , the source was significantly outside the einstein ring .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to predict the future course of such events .",
    "therefore , such events can not meet objective criteria that far from the peak , but selecting themsubjectively \" would require a commitment to continue observing them for several more weeks of the campaign , which risks wasting a large number of observations if the event turns out to be very low - magnification with almost zero planet sensitivity ( the most likely scenario ) .",
    "at the same time , if the event timescale is short , it could be over before the next opportunity to start observations with _ spitzer _ (  10 days later )    hence , @xcite also specified the possibility of so - called  secret alerts \" . for these , an observational sequence would be uploaded to _ spitzer _ for a given week , but no announcement would be made .",
    "if the event looked promising later ( after upload ) , then it could be chosen subjectively . in this case , _ spitzer _ data taken after the public alert could be included in the parallax measurement ( needed to enter the galactic - distribution sample ) but _ spitzer _ data taken before this date could not .",
    "if the event was subsequently regarded as unpromising , it would not be subjectively alerted , in which case the observations could be halted the next week without violating the @xcite protocols .",
    "this was exactly the case for ogle-2015-blg-1482 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it was @xmath56secretly \" alerted at the upload for observations to begin at hjd@xmath57 = hjd-2450000 = 7206.73 .",
    "it was only because of this secret alert that an observation was made near peak , which became the basis for the current paper .",
    "in fact , its subsequent rise was so fast ( due to its short timescale ) that it was subjectively alerted just prior to the near - peak _ spitzer _ observation . at the next week",
    "s upload , it met the objective criteria .",
    "note , however , that if we had waited for the event to become objective before triggering observations , we would not have been able to make the mass measurement reported here , even though the planet sensitivity analysis would have been almost identically the same ( provided that parallax could still be measured with the remaining _ spitzer _ observations ) .",
    "this is the first _",
    "microlensing event for which a  secret alert \" played a crucial role .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations were made in @xmath58 m channel on the irac camera from hjd@xmath57 = hjd - 2450000 = 7206.73 to 7221.04 .",
    "the data were reduced using specialized software developed specifically for this program @xcite . even though the _ spitzer _",
    "data are relatively sparse , there is one point near the peak , which proves to be essential to determine the normalized source radius @xmath6 .",
    "event ogle-2015-blg-1482 was densely , and almost continuously covered by ground - based data , but showed no significant anomalies ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this has two very important implications .",
    "first , it means that the ground - based light curve can be analyzed as a point lens .",
    "second , it implies that it is very likely ( but not absolutely guaranteed ) that the _ spitzer _ light curve can likewise be analyzed as a point lens .",
    "the reason that the latter conclusion is not absolutely secure is that the _ spitzer _ and ground - based light curves are separated in the einstein ring by @xmath59 .",
    "thus , even though we can be quite certain that the ground - based source trajectory did not go through ( or even near ) any caustics of significant size , it is still possible that the source as seen from _",
    "did pass through a significant caustic , but that this caustic was just too small to affect the ground - based light curve .",
    "nevertheless , since the closest _",
    "point to peak has impact parameter @xmath60 and it is quite rare for events to show caustic anomalies at such separations when there are no anomalies seen in densely sampled data @xmath61 , we proceed under the assumption that the event can be analyzed as a point lens from both earth and _ spitzer_. thus , we conduct the single lens modeling of the observed light curve by minimizing @xmath62 over parameter space . for the @xmath62 minimization",
    ", we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "thanks to the simultaneous observation from the earth and satellite , we are able to measure the microlens parallax @xmath63 , which are the north and east components of the parallax vector @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "light curve has a point near the peak of the light curve , and thus we can also measure the normalized source radius @xmath6 .",
    "hence , we put three single lensing parameters of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath13 , the parallax parameters of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the normalized source radius @xmath6 as free parameters in the modeling .",
    "in addition , there are two flux parameters for each of the 5 observatories ( _ spitzer _ , ogle , kmt ctio , kmt saao , kmt sso ) .",
    "one represents the source flux @xmath66 as seen from the @xmath67th observatory , while the other , @xmath68 is the blended flux within the aperture that does not participate in the event .",
    "that is , the five observed fluxes @xmath69 at epochs @xmath70 are simultaneously modeled by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the magnification as a function of time at the @xmath67th observatory . in principle , these magnifications may differ because the observatories are at different locations .",
    "however , in this event the separations of the observatories on earth are so small compared to the projected size of the einstein ring that we ignore them and consider all earth - based observations as being made from earth s center .",
    "that is , we ignore so - called  terrestrial parallax `` . at the same time , the distance between the earth and _ spitzer _ remains highly significant , so @xmath73 is different from @xmath74 . as is customary ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", we determine the parameters in the @xmath56geocentric '' frame at the peak of the event as observed from earth @xcite , and likewise adopt the sign conventions shown in figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we conduct the modeling for the point - source / point - lens , because only a single point of _ spitzer _ contributes to the finite - source effect .",
    "we find that the @xmath75 between the best - fit models of the point- and finite - sources is @xmath76 .",
    "hence , ogle-2015-blg-1482 strongly favors the finite - source model .      as we will show , the lens either transits or passes very close to the source as seen by _",
    ", which induces finite - source effects near the peak of the _ spitzer _ light curve .",
    "to account for this , we adopt a limb - darkened brightness profile for the source star of the form @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the mean surface brightness of the source , @xmath79 is the total flux at wavelength @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the limb darkening coefficient , and @xmath82 is the angle between the normal to the surface of the source star and the line of sight @xcite .",
    "based on the estimated color and magnitude of the source , which is discussed in section 4 , assuming an effective temperature @xmath83 , solar metallicity , surface gravity @xmath84 , and microturbulent velocity @xmath85 km / s , we adopt @xmath86 from @xcite .      as discussed in section 1 ,",
    "space - based parallax measurements for point lenses generically give rise to four solutions , which can be highly degenerate .",
    "however , in cases for which one of two observations has @xmath88 , while the other has @xmath89 , the four solutions reduce to two solutions .",
    "since for event ogle-2015-blg-1482 , @xmath90 has @xmath91 , we expect the event to have two degenerate solutions , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . however , what we see in table 1 is not two degenerate solutions but four .",
    "for each of the two expected degenerate solutions [ @xmath94 , there are two solutions with different values of @xmath6 ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the best - fit light curve of the event ogle-2015-blg-1482 with the ogle , kmt , and _",
    "spitzer _ data sets .",
    "the best - fit solution is @xmath97 solution for @xmath95 , which means @xmath92 and @xmath91 .",
    "the biggest @xmath75 between the four solutions is @xmath98 .",
    "we should expect the two - fold parallax to be very severe in this case .",
    "this two - fold degeneracy would be exact in the approximations that 1 ) earth and _ spitzer _ are in rectilinear motion and 2 ) they have zero relative projected velocity @xcite . for events that are very short compared to a year ( like this one ) , the approximation of rectilinear motion is excellent . and",
    "while earth and _ spitzer _ had relative projected motion of order @xmath99 , this must be compared to the lens - source projected velocity @xmath100 , @xmath101 hence , these two solutions are almost perfectly degenerate . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath6 degeneracy was completely unexpected .",
    "it is also very severe .",
    "the origins of the @xmath6 degeneracy are discussed in section 5 . to illustrate the @xmath6 degeneracy ,",
    "the light curve of the best - fit model @xmath97 for @xmath96 is also presented in figure 1 . in table 1 , we present the parameters of all the four solutions .",
    "the color and magnitude of the source are estimated from the observed @xmath102 source color and best - fit modeling of the light curve , but they are affected by extinction and reddening due to the interstellar dust along the line of sight . the dereddened color and magnitude of the source can be determined by comparing to the color and magnitude of the red clump giant ( rc ) under the assumption that the source and rc experience the same amount of reddening and extinction @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the instrumental kmt ctio color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of stars in the observed field .",
    "the color and magnitude of the rc are obtained from the position of the rc on the cmd , which correspond to @xmath103_{\\rm rc } = [ 1.67 , 17.15]$ ] .",
    "we adopt the intrinsic color and magnitude of the rc with @xmath104 = 1.06 @xcite and @xmath105 = 14.50 @xcite . the instrumental source color obtained from a regression",
    "is @xmath106 and the magnitude of the source obtained from the best - fit model is @xmath107 .",
    "the measured offset between the source and the rc is @xmath108 = [ 0.07 , 0.22]$ ] . here",
    "we note that there exists an offset between the instrumental magnitudes of ogle and kmtnet as @xmath109 mag .",
    "thus , we should consider the offset when we estimate the dereddened magnitude of the source . as a result",
    ", we find the dereddened color and magnitude of the source @xmath103_{\\rm s,0 } = [ 1.13 , 14.76]$ ] .",
    "the dereddened @xmath110 source color by using the color - color relation of @xcite is @xmath111 . then adopting @xmath112 to the the color - surface brightness relation of @xcite",
    ", we determine the source angular radius @xmath113 .",
    "the estimated color and magnitude of the source suggest that the source is a k type giant .",
    "the error in @xmath114 includes the uncertainty in the source flux , the uncertainty in the conversion from the observed @xmath102 color to the surface brightness , and the uncertainty of centroiding the rc .",
    "the uncertainty in the source flux is about @xmath115 and the uncertainty of the microlensing color is @xmath116 mag , which contributes @xmath117 error in @xmath114 measurement .",
    "the scatter of the source angular radius relation in @xmath112 is @xmath118 @xcite , and centroiding the rc contributes @xmath119 to the radius uncertainty @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , since the degeneracy between two different @xmath6 solutions is very severe as @xmath120 , we should consider both @xmath6 solutions .",
    "the two @xmath6 values yield two different einstein radii , @xmath121 because of the two different einstein radii , all the physical parameters related to the lens take on two discrete values .",
    "the relative proper motions of the lens and source are , @xmath122      the mass and distance of the lens can be obtained from the measured einstein radius @xmath14 and microlens parallax @xmath15 . as discussed in the introduction , the four - fold degeneracy in @xmath25 usually leads to a two - fold degeneracy in its amplitude @xmath15 .",
    "however , in the case of events that are much higher magnification ( much lower @xmath31 ) as seen from one observatory than the other , the two - fold degeneracy collapses as well .",
    "this is because , under these conditions , @xmath123 .",
    "the present case is consistent with the lens passing exactly over the center of the source as seen by _",
    "( to our ability to measure it )",
    ". then , according to equation , we measure the lens mass , @xmath124 the lens - source relative parallax for the two cases is @xmath125 these values of @xmath126 are very small compared to the source parallax @xmath127mas .",
    "this implies that the distance between the lens and the source is determined much more precisely than the distance to the lens or the source separately .",
    "that is , @xmath128 @xmath129    since the source is almost certainly a bulge clump star ( from its position on the cmd ) , and the lens is @xmath130 kpc from the source , it is likewise almost certainly in the bulge . thus , this is the first isolated low - mass object that has been determined to lie in the galactic bulge .",
    "event ogle-2015-blg-1482 has a very severe two - fold degeneracy in @xmath6 , in which the @xmath75 between the two solutions ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) is @xmath131 . for the solutions with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the microlens parallax vectors @xmath25 are different from one another , but they have almost the same amplitude @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the two solutions yield almost the same physical parameters of the lens . however , each of the two solutions also has two degenerate @xmath6 solutions : @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "each @xmath6 solution yields different physical parameters of the lens , in particular the lens mass . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the lens is a very low - mass star , while for @xmath96 it is a brown dwarf .",
    "the degeneracy of the lens mass due to the two @xmath6 can be resolved from direct lens imaging by using instruments with high spatial resolution ( han & chang 2003 ; henderson et al .",
    "2014 ) , such as the visao camera of the 6.5 m magellan telescope with the resolution @xmath132 in the @xmath133 band @xcite band images , which gives hope for optical ao .",
    "however , it is premature to claim that this technique can be applied to faint stars in the galactic bulge ] and the gmtifs of the 24.5 m giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) with resolution @xmath134 in the nir @xcite . in general ,",
    "direct imaging requires 1 ) that the lens be luminous , and 2 ) that it be sufficiently far from the source to be separately resolved . in the present case ,",
    "( 1 ) clearly fails for the bd solution .",
    "hence , the way that high - resolution imaging would resolve the degeneracy is to look for the luminous ( but faint ) m dwarf predicted by the other solution at its predicted orientation ( either almost due north or due south of the source  since @xmath135 ) and with its predicted separation @xmath136 .",
    "if the m dwarf fails to appear at one of these two expected positions , the bd solution is correct .",
    "since the source is a clump giant , and hence roughly @xmath137 times brighter than the m dwarf , it is likely that the two can not be separately resolved until they are separated by at least 2.5 fwhm .",
    "this requires to wait until @xmath138 for magellan or @xmath139 for gmt .",
    "the degeneracy in @xmath6 was completely unexpected .",
    "indeed we discovered it accidentally because @xmath6 had one value in one of two degenerate parallax solutions and the other value in another one .",
    "originally , this led us to think that it was somehow connected to the parallax degeneracy . however , by seeding both solutions with both values of @xmath6 we discovered that it was completely independent of the parallax degeneracy .    in retrospect , the reason for this degeneracy is `` obvious '' .",
    "there is only a single point that is strongly impacted by the finite size of the source .",
    "the value of @xmath140 at this time is well predicted by the rest of the light curve , in particular because _ spitzer _ data begin before peak ( see section  2 ) , @xmath141 hence , the magnification ( for point - lens / point - source geometry in a high magnification event ) is also known @xmath142 . moreover ,",
    "both @xmath143 and @xmath144 for _ spitzer _ are also well measured , so that the measured flux at the near - peak point @xmath145 directly yields an empirical magnification @xmath146 ( i.e. the magnification in the presence of finite - source effects ) .",
    "following @xcite , the ratio of @xmath147 and @xmath148 can therefore be derived directly from the light curve @xmath149    as shown by figure 1 of @xcite , @xmath150 reaches a peak at @xmath151 , with @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , if one inverts a measurement of @xmath150 to infer a value of @xmath153 , there are respectively one , two and zero solutions for @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",
    "since this event is a high - magnification event only for _ spitzer _ , i.e. , the finite - source effect is only seen by _ spitzer _ , only the trajectory of _ spitzer _ is considered .",
    "figure 3 ( adapted from @xcite ) shows the finite - source effect function @xmath150 as a function of @xmath153 . for this event , @xmath157 at the nearest point to the peak , which is indicated by the horizontal dotted line in the figure . as shown in figure 3",
    ", the function @xmath158 is satisfied at two different values of @xmath159 and @xmath160 , which implies ( as outlined above ) that there are two @xmath6 values .",
    "the two @xmath153 values yield two normalized source radii of @xmath161 ( for @xmath162 ) and @xmath163 ( for @xmath164 ) .",
    "these two derived @xmath6 values are almost the same as those obtained numerically from the best - fit solutions . because high - magnification events can be alerted in real time , the high - magnification events observed from earth are often well covered around the peak by intensive follow - up observations , and thus @xmath6 is almost always well measured if there are significant finite - source effects ( i.e. , @xmath165 for some points ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath6 degeneracy will often be resolved in high - magnification events observed from the ground . on the other hand ,",
    "since the observation cadence of _ spitzer _ is much lower than those of ground - based observations , the @xmath6 degeneracy can occur frequently in high - magnification events observed by _",
    "spitzer_. note that , in contrast to figure 1 of @xcite , our figure 3 shows @xmath150 with and without the effects of limb darkening .",
    "the effect is hardly distinguishable by eye , in particular because limb darkening at @xmath166 m is very weak .",
    "nevertheless this effect should be included .",
    "if finite - source effects are reliably detected from a single measurement near peak , how often will @xmath6 be ambiguous , and if it is ambiguous , how often will the value fall in the upper versus lower allowed ranges ?",
    "we might judge there to be areliable detection \" of finite - source effects from a single point if @xmath167 , where @xmath168 might be taken as 5% .",
    "for high - magnification events including the limb darkening effect , we can taylor expand @xmath169 for @xmath170 ( see appendix ) @xmath171 where @xmath81 is the limb darkening coefficient , as mentioned in section 3 .",
    "truncating at the second term , we have @xmath172 . for _ spitzer _",
    "@xmath173 , so we can ignore it",
    ". then @xmath174 .",
    "thus , @xmath175 , i.e. , @xmath176 , implies @xmath177 ( for @xmath178 ) . to next order , @xmath179 which is very close to the numerical value , 1.7",
    "hence , we have three ranges of recognizable finite - source effects .",
    "the ranges are presented in table 3 .",
    "table 3 shows that @xmath180 of the finite - source effects will be unambiguous .",
    "and of the times they are ambiguous @xmath181 will have the higher value of @xmath6 .",
    "figure 4 shows the @xmath62 distribution of @xmath182 versus @xmath6 from the mcmc chains of the four degenerate solutions in table 1 .",
    "the figure shows that the distribution is centered on @xmath183 and thus the four solutions are consistent with @xmath183 , although there is scatter .",
    "therefore , it is correct to label @xmath182 as  0 \" .",
    "the figure also shows that the nearest point to the peak of _ spitzer _ light curve favors @xmath184 , but can accommodate other values of @xmath182 , up to about 0.03 at @xmath185 . in this case",
    ", the bigger @xmath182 makes @xmath150 bigger because @xmath186 , and so allowing values of @xmath153 between the two best - fit values . at the nearest point to the peak , @xmath187 .",
    "then , @xmath188 since @xmath189 from figure 3 , @xmath190 , and it is the maximum value allowed @xmath169 , and thus the maximum allowed @xmath182 . the allowed maximum @xmath191 yields @xmath192 and @xmath193 and hence two @xmath6 values , @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "thus , @xmath96 solutions have the lower limit of @xmath196 , while @xmath95 solutions have the upper limit of @xmath195 .",
    "ogle-2015-blg-0763 is the only other event with a single lens mass measurement based on finite - source effects observed by _",
    "spitzer _ @xcite .",
    "as with ogle-2016-blg-1482 , the _ spitzer _",
    "light curve shows only one point that is strongly affected by finite - source effects ( i.e. , @xmath165 ) .",
    "@xcite report @xmath197 , @xmath198days and their solution implies @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , the three points closest to peak @xcite at @xmath201days , have respectively , @xmath202 .",
    "since the measurement was derived primarily from the highest point , one may infer @xmath203 .",
    "inspection of figure 3 shows that this implies @xmath204 , which ( since @xmath205 ) implies that there is another solution at @xmath206 and therefore with @xmath207 .",
    "we can then derive for the two solutions @xmath208 ( adopted ) and @xmath209 ( other ) .",
    "these yield values of @xmath169 ( from figure  3 ) of @xmath210 ( adopted ) and @xmath211 ( other ) .",
    "that is , for ogle-2015-blg-0763 , the two nearest points to the peak will both be about 0.08 mag brighter in the adopted solution than in the other solution . since the _ spitzer _",
    "photometric errors are small compared to these inferred differences ( figure  2 of @xcite ) , we expect that , in the case of ogle-2015-blg-0763 ( and in contrast to ogle-2015-blg-1482 ) , the near - peak points resolve the degeneracy between the two solutions .",
    "armed with the above understanding , which was derived without any detailed modeling , we reanalyze ogle-2015-blg-0763 and find only an upper limit of 0.01 for the second @xmath6 .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , solutions of the second @xmath6 result in inconsistency with observations , and thus they are not physically correct . as a result , there is no @xmath6 degeneracy for the event ogle-2015-blg-0763 . as mentioned before , this is because of the near - peak points .",
    "this implies that although for events in which the finite - source effect is seen only in the _ spitzer _ the @xmath6 degeneracy can occur frequently due to low observation cadence of the _ spitzer _ , it can be resolved by a few data points near the peak .",
    "the error in the @xmath6 measurement of the event ogle-2015-blg-1482 is @xmath212 for @xmath95 and @xmath213 for @xmath96 .",
    "these errors are quite big relative to measurements in high - magnification events from the ground .",
    "we therefore study the source of these errors in @xmath6 both to determine why they are so different and to make sure that we are properly incorporating all sources of error in this measurement .",
    "as outlined above , the train of information is basically captured by @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the inverse of @xmath150 and both @xmath140 and @xmath169 can be regarded approximately as  measured \" quantities .",
    "it is instructive to further expand this expression @xmath216 in this form , it is clear that the contribution from an error in determining @xmath140 tends to be suppressed if @xmath217 ( i.e. , @xmath218 , so @xmath96 in our case ) , and it tends to be enhanced if @xmath219 . hence , this feature of equation goes in the direction of explaining the larger error in the @xmath95 case .",
    "second , if we for the moment ignore the error in @xmath140 , then equation implies @xmath220 .",
    "for the two cases , @xmath221 , we have @xmath222 , @xmath223 and so @xmath224 .",
    "hence , this aspect also favors larger errors for the smaller @xmath6 ( larger @xmath153 ) solution .",
    "this is intuitively clear from figure 3 : the shallow slope of @xmath150 toward large @xmath153 makes it difficult to estimate @xmath153 from a measurement of @xmath169 .",
    "hence , the fact that the fractional error in @xmath6 is much larger for the large @xmath153 ( small @xmath6 ) solution is well understood .    ignoring blending , we can write @xmath225 .",
    "the error in @xmath145 ( i.e. , the flux measurement at the high point ) is uncorrelated with any other error .",
    "since in our case , @xmath226 , we can write @xmath227 , and so @xmath228 since @xmath30 is known extremely well , and @xmath229 is known essentially perfectly , there would appear to be essentially no error in @xmath230 .",
    "the denominator is a near - invariant in high - magnification events @xcite .",
    "that is , the errors in this product are generally much smaller than the errors in either one separately .",
    "this means that the error in @xmath169 ( and so @xmath215 ) is dominated by the flux measurement error of the single point that is affected by finite - source effects .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to recognize that @xcite derived their conclusion regarding the invariance of @xmath231 under conditions that the error in @xmath143 is completely dominated by the model , and not by the flux measurement errors . indeed , as a rather technical , but very relevant point , it is customary practice to ignore the role of flux measurement errors in the determination of @xmath143 .",
    "that is , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are normally _ not _ included as chain variables when modeling microlensing events . instead",
    ", the magnification is determined at each point along the light curve from microlens parameters that are in the chain , and then the two flux parameters ( from each observatory ) are determined from a linear fit .",
    "this is a perfectly valid approach for the overwhelming majority of microlensing events because the errors arising from this fit ( which are returned but usually not reported from the linear fit routine ) are normally tiny compared to the error in @xmath143 due to the model .",
    "moreover , there are usually many observatories contributing to the light curve , and if all the flux parameters were incorporated in the chain , it would increase the convergence time exponentially .",
    "however , in the present case @xmath232 is essentially determined from ground - based data , which are both numerous and very high precision , while @xmath143 is determined from just 16 _ spitzer _ points ( i.e. , all the points save the one near peak ) .",
    "if the usual ( linear fit ) procedure were applied , it would seriously underestimate the error in @xmath143 and so overestimate its degree anticorrelation with @xmath232 .",
    "we therefore include @xmath233 as chain parameters and remodel this event .",
    "the result of the remodeling is presented in table 2 . by comparing to runs in which we treat these flux parameters in the usual way",
    ", we find that including these parameters in the chain contributes about 41% to the @xmath6 error compared to all other sources of @xmath6 error combined .",
    "that is , in the end , this does not dramatically increase the final error , since @xmath234 .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to treat @xmath233 in a formally proper way since this contribution could easily be the dominant one in other cases .",
    "the @xmath6 degeneracy was not realized until now for several reasons .",
    "first of all , although single lens finite - source events have been routinely detected from ground - based observations , they are not scientifically very interesting without the measurement of @xmath15",
    ". however , @xmath15 measurements of single lens events based on ground - based data alone are intrinsically rare and technically difficult @xcite .",
    "second , prior to the establishment of second - generation microlensing surveys , observations of high - magnification microlensing events were usually conducted under the survey+followup mode , which was first suggested by @xcite .",
    "high - magnification events with their nearly 100% sensitivity to planets @xcite were therefore often followed up with intensive ( @xmath2351 min cadence ) observations , which could easily resolve this @xmath6 degeneracy , if it exists .",
    "the @xmath6 degeneracy is nevertheless important for the science of second - generation ground - based and future space - based microlensing surveys .",
    "the majority of events found by these surveys will not be followed up at all , and thus the @xmath6 degeneracy can appear because the typical source radius crossing time , @xmath236 , is comparable to the observing cadences that these surveys adopt . here",
    "@xmath237 where @xmath238as is the angular source size of a sun - like star in the bulge , and 7 @xmath239 is the typical value for lens - source relative proper motion of disk lenses . for second - generation microlensing surveys like ogle - iv and kmtnet , although a few fields are observed once every @xmath240 min , the majority of fields are observed at @xmath241 hr cadences .",
    "therefore , the single lens finite - source events in these relatively low - cadence fields are likely to have one single data point probing the finite - source effect , and thus the @xmath6 degeneracy appears .",
    "fortunately , however , the result of event ogle-2015-blg-0763 showed that a few additional data points ( before / after crossing the source ) around the peak play a crucial role in resolving the @xmath6 degeneracy .",
    "when we observe typical microlensing events with a cadence of 1 hr , we can obtain 2 more data points right before and after crossing the source , except one source - crossing data point . in this case , the @xmath6 degeneracy will be resolved as in the event ogle-2015-blg-0763 .",
    "this implies that 1 hr is the upper limit of the observing cadence to resolve the @xmath6 degeneracy in typical single lens events to be observed from the second - generation ground - based surveys , whereas for events with high @xmath27 , such as events caused by a fast moving lens object or a high - velocity source star , it is not enough to resolve the @xmath6 degeneracy .",
    "since about half of kmtnet fields have @xmath242 hr cadences and these fields have higher probability of detecting events than the other fields with cadences of @xmath243 hr , the @xmath6 degeneracy will be resolved in the majority of single high - magnification events to be observed by kmtnet .",
    "although @xmath15 is still intrinsically hard to measure even with second - generation surveys , the fraction of events with finite - source effects can be used as an indicator of the properties of the lens population , which is especially important for validating the short - timescale events such as the population of free - floating planets ( ffps ) @xcite .",
    "_ the wide - field infrared survey telescope _",
    "( _ wfirst _ ) is likely to have six microlensing campaigns , each with 72 days observing a @xmath2353 deg@xmath244 microlensing field at 15 min cadence @xcite .",
    "_ wfirst _ microlensing is expected to detect thousands of bound planets and hundreds of ffps . at first sight ,",
    "the 15 min cadence that _ wfirst _ microlensing is currently adopting suggests that it will not be affected by the @xmath6 degeneracy .",
    "however , since _ wfirst _ will go much fainter than ground - based surveys , most of the sources for _ wfirst _ events will be m dwarfs , which are a half or even a quarter the size of sun . then the typical @xmath236 for _ wfirst _ events is @xmath23515 min , which is the same as the adopted cadence .",
    "hence , as mentioned above , although the @xmath6 degeneracy can be usually resolved by obtaining more than 2 data points around the peak , it will be severe for a significant fraction of events with high @xmath27 .",
    "what makes this @xmath6 degeneracy more important for _ wfirst _ is that @xmath15 can be measured relatively easily once ground - based observations are taken simultaneously @xcite .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy in @xmath6 will directly lead to a degeneracy in the mass determination of isolated objects , including ffps , bds , and stellar - mass black holes .      as discussed in section 3 , it is possible that the deviation of the highly magnified _",
    "point might be caused by a caustic structure rather than being entirely due to finite - source effects .",
    "it is easy to show qualitatively that this could affect the exact nature of the system , but is unlikely to significantly change the conclusion that the lens is a low - mass object in the bulge .",
    "first , if there were a caustic perturbation , there would be a second body in the lens system .",
    "however , we do not see any evidence for the second body in the ground - based light curve , and therefore the dominant lensing effect still comes from a single star .",
    "second , consider the effect on the inferred physical properties of the lens ( e.g. , mass and distance ) .",
    "if there were a caustic structure , then it is likely to be small since it does not affected the ground - based data . in that case",
    "@xmath6 would be smaller and therefore @xmath14 would be larger . at the same time",
    ", @xmath13 is clearly determined from the dense , ground - based observations , so if @xmath14 is larger , @xmath27 must also be larger . however , @xmath27 is already 9 @xmath239 for the smaller @xmath6 solution .",
    "larger values of @xmath27 are increasingly improbable and will eventually become unphysical .",
    "hence , ogle-2015-blg-1482 is likely an event caused by the single lens star .",
    "however , since a binary lens system could simultaneously reproduce the single lens - like light curve from ground - based observations and the poorly sampled light curve from _ spitzer _ , we conduct binary lens modeling . as a result",
    ", we find that the best - fit binary lens solution is the bd binary lens system composed of a primary star @xmath245 and a secondary star @xmath246 with their projected separation 19 au , which correspond to lensing parameters of the mass ratio between the binary components @xmath247 and the projected separation in units of @xmath14 of the lens system @xmath248 .",
    "the estimated distance to the bd binary is 7.5 kpc , and thus it is also located in the galactic bulge . although @xmath62 of the binary lens model is smaller than that of the single lens model by 35 , it is a very wide binary system with large @xmath249 , and thus it is extremely closely related to ( in fact , a variety of ) the single lens solution with @xmath95 .",
    "it is important to understand the reason for this close relation .",
    "the key point is that the high point of _ spitzer _ is explained by finite - source effects on the tiny caustic of the very wide bd binary that `` replaces '' the point caustic of the point lens in the single lens solution .",
    "but the @xmath62 improvement for the binary solution comes entirely from ground - based data , while the @xmath62 of the _ spitzer _ becomes slightly worse than that of the single lens model ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , the _ spitzer _",
    "high point is not caused by the binary , as we originally sought to test .",
    "the @xmath62 improvement could in principle be due to a distant companion .",
    "however , low - level systematics can also easily produce @xmath250 improvements in microlensing light curves , which could then mistakenly be attributed to planets , binaries , etc . for this reason , @xcite and",
    "@xcite already set a threshold at @xmath251 for the detection of a planet based on experience with several dozen carefully analyzed events .",
    "thus , all we can say about ogle-2015-blg-1482 is that the lens is consistent with being isolated but that we can not rule out that it has a distant companion . and that the  evidence \" for such a companion is consistent with the systematic effects often seen in microlensing events .    in order to find out whether there is a binary solution for which",
    "the high point of _ spitzer _ is actually explained by the caustic of a binary , we also conduct binary lens modeling in which @xmath252 . from this , we find that there is no valid binary lens solution with small @xmath6 . this is because although we find two solutions with better @xmath62 relative to the single lens model , the best fit lens - source relative proper motions are @xmath253 and @xmath254 for the @xmath255 and @xmath256 solutions , respectively .",
    "these are very large ( as anticipated in the previous paragraph ) to the extent that they are unphysical .",
    "one of the two solutions ( for @xmath255 ) is the binary system composed of a primary star @xmath257 and a planet @xmath258 with their projected separation 9.3 au , while for the other solution ( for @xmath256 ) it is the binary system composed of a primary star @xmath259 and a planet @xmath260 with the separation 14.7 au , and these binaries are respectively located at 3.7 kpc and 1.6 kpc .",
    "the very large proper motion is due to large @xmath14 , while @xmath13 is clearly determined from dense ground - based observations , as mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "moreover , the @xmath62 of the _ spitzer _ data for the two binary lens models becomes worse .",
    "we analyzed the single lens event ogle-2015-blg-1482 simultaneously observed from two ground - based surveys and from _",
    "spitzer_. the _ spitzer _ data exhibit the finite - source effect due to the passage of the lens directly over the surface of the source star as seen from _ spitzer_.",
    "thanks to the finite - source effect and the simultaneous observation from earth and _ spitzer _ , we were able to measure the mass of the lens . from this analysis , we found that the lens of ogle-2015-blg-1482 is a very low - mass star with the mass @xmath0 or a brown dwarf with the mass @xmath261 , which are respectively located at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and thus it is the first isolated low - mass object located in the galactic bulge .",
    "the degeneracy between the two solutions is very severe ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the fundamental reason for the degeneracy is that the finite - source effect is seen only in a single data point from _ spitzer _ and this data point has the finite - source effect function @xmath262 , where @xmath263 .",
    "we showed that whenever @xmath264 , there are two solutions for @xmath153 and hence for @xmath265 . because the @xmath6 degeneracy can be resolved only by relatively high cadence observations around the peak , while the _ spitzer _",
    "cadence is typically @xmath266 , we expect that events where the finite - source effect is seen only in the _ spitzer _ data may frequently exhibit the @xmath6 degeneracy .    in the case of ogle-2015-blg-1482 ,",
    "the lens - source relative proper motion for the low - mass star is @xmath8 , while for the brown dwarf it is @xmath267 .",
    "hence , the severe degeneracy can be resolved within @xmath268 from direct lens imaging by using next - generation instruments with high spatial resolution .",
