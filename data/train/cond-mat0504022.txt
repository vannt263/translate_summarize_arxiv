    "the presence of quenched disorder of different types is an inevitable feature of real materials .",
    "the effect of randomness on the physical properties of systems is often dramatic , in particular in the vicinity of singular points , such as for classical phase transitions at finite temperature or for quantum phase transitions at @xmath3 . in a random system",
    "the set of critical exponents associated with a phase transition can be completely different from that in the nonrandom system , which means that disorder can be a relevant perturbation in the sense of the harris criterion.@xcite in most of the studies of disordered systems the parameters ( couplings , longitudinal or transverse fields , etc . ) are expected to be independent and identically distributed random variables among which there is no correlation .",
    "there are , however , systems in which the random variables exhibit some kind of correlations , the effect of which can even change the random universality class of the phase transition . examples of systems with strongly correlated disorder are random quantum magnets at @xmath3 , in which the disorder is strictly correlated in the temporal direction .",
    "indeed the critical properties of a such type of random systems are quite unusual , for a review see ref .  .",
    "in the classical counterpart of these quantum systems , the disorder is strictly correlated in one direction , which leads to models introduced and partially exactly solved by mccoy and wu.@xcite in a further generalization , the disorder can be strictly correlated in a @xmath4 dimensional subspace , where @xmath5 is the dimension of the system.@xcite    correlations between random variables can also be isotropic .",
    "one example is presented in ref .",
    "in which the experimental observations are explained@xcite with the assumption of the presence of randomly oriented dislocation lines in the sample .",
    "also in some random quantum magnets@xcite and in the non - fermi liquid behavior of @xmath6-electron compounds@xcite the disorder is expected to be isotropically correlated due to long - ranged ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interactions . in a coarse - grained picture ,",
    "the disorder in some coupling strength @xmath7 is characterized by its correlator , @xmath8 , which is expected to be isotropic , @xmath9 , and to decay algebraically for large arguments : @xmath10 .",
    "for example , randomly oriented straight dislocation lines are associated with a correlator exponent @xmath11 .",
    "the influence of gaussian disorder with power - law correlations on the critical behavior of the @xmath12-component vector spin model has been studied in ref .   by field - theoretical methods using a double expansion in @xmath13 and @xmath14 . extending the harris criterion , correlated disorder with @xmath15",

    "fixed point the correlation length critical exponent is found to be given by @xmath20 this result is argued to be exact and thus the extended harris criterion in eq .",
    "( [ harris ] ) is marginal when the long - range nature of the correlations is relevant .",
    "on the other hand the magnetic exponents , such as @xmath21 , depend on both @xmath22 and @xmath5 .",
    "recently,@xcite the validity of the scaling relation  ( [ nu_ft ] ) has been questioned on the basis of a direct renormalization analysis of the scaling functions for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) system in the two - loop approximation , using a pade - borel summation technique to evaluate the critical exponents for different values of @xmath22 .",
    "numerical and field - theoretical calculations on different types of systems with correlated disorder ( percolation,@xcite 3d ising model,@xcite polymers,@xcite quantum ising model,@xcite etc . ) seem to be in overall agreement with the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ nu_ft ] ) .    here",
    "we should make , however , two remarks .",
    "first , in the case of the ising model with randomly distributed dislocation lines , oriented along the lattice axes,@xcite for which rotational symmetry is broken , the critical behavior was found to be the same as for the model with gaussian correlated disorder when @xmath23 .",
    "this shows that the details of the model of correlated disorder are seemingly irrelevant , the critical behavior being essentially governed by the decay of the disorder correlations .",
    "our second remark concerns the fact that , in systems with correlated disorder , the location of the critical point is generally not known exactly , which introduces a limitation on the accuracy of the numerical calculations .    in the present paper ,",
    "our aim is to increase the numerical accuracy of the calculation in a statistical mechanical system with correlated disorder and address also such questions ( c.f .",
    "critical point density profiles , validity of conformal invariance , etc . ) which have not been considered previously . for this purpose , we consider the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice ising model and introduce a type of biaxially correlated disorder which preserves self - duality , thus the critical point is exactly known .",
    "our model can be considered as a 2d self - dual version of the random dislocation model of ballesteros and parisi.@xcite in the vicinity of the critical point the properties of the system are explored at the scale of the ( diverging ) correlation length .",
    "a correlator exponent , @xmath24 , can be deduced from the integral of the disorder correlator inside a large square of linear size , @xmath25 .",
    "thus at a coarse - grained level our model can be compared to a model with gaussian correlated disorder for the same value of @xmath22 .    for the 2d ising model uncorrelated disorder coupled to the local energy density ( such as dilution or random ferromagnetic couplings )",
    "is a marginally irrelevant perturbation,@xcite hence critical singularities of the pure system are supplemented by logarithmic corrections .",
    "in particular the correlation length exponent @xmath19 keeps its unperturbed value @xmath26 . as a consequence from eq .",
    "( [ harris ] ) the biaxially correlated disorder of our model is expected to be relevant . in order to explore the critical properties of the system and to check the validity of eq .",
    "( [ nu_ft ] ) we perform large scale monte carlo simulations . in particular",
    "the critical exponents are deduced from the finite - size scaling behavior of various magnetic and thermal quantities at the critical temperature , which is exactly known .",
    "we also determine the critical profiles of the magnetization and energy densities in order to check whether the forms obtained for the profiles through conformal methods remain valid in the random system after averaging over the disorder .",

    "an important advantage of the parametrization used in eq .",
