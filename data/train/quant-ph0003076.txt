    "recently , kane @xcite proposed a silicon - based nuclear spin quantum computer .",
    "this proposal linked the theoretical field of quantum computation with the well - developed silicon industry technology .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite to use nuclear spins , @xmath0 , of impurity phosphorus atoms ( @xmath1p ) in silicon ( @xmath2si ) as qubits for quantum computation .",
    "selective one - qubit rotation of nuclear spins can be implemented by combining the action of electrostatic gates and resonant radio frequency ( _ rf _ ) pulses .",
    "the electrostatic gate increases the size of the electron cloud of the selected phosphorus atom changing the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin ( @xmath3 ) and the nuclear spin of the phosphorus atom . a two - qubit quantum control - not ( cn ) gate can be implemented by combining resonant _ rf _",
    "pulses by applying two electrostatic gates acting on the neighboring phosphorus atoms . under the action of electrostatic gates ,",
    "the electron clouds of the neighboring atoms increase their size and overlap .",
    "this causes an exchange interaction between electron spins which , in turn , generates an indirect coupling between the associated nuclear spins .    to measure the state of the nuclear spin ,",
    "it was proposed in @xcite to transfer the state of the nuclear spin to the electron spin .",
    "then , using an electrostatic gate , one induces a transfer of the electron from the measured phosphorus atom to the auxiliary phosphorus atom . because of the pauli principle",
    ", this transfer is possible only if the electron spins of the measured atom and the auxiliary atom have opposite directions .",
    "the change of the charge of the auxiliary atom can be measured by a single - electron transistor .",
    "this attractive proposal may , however , face difficulties associated with : ( a ) the precise manipulation of the electron clouds using electrostatic gates , ( b ) the complicated diagram of transferring the nuclear spin state to the electron spin state , and ( c ) the application of the single - electron transistor .",
    "vrijen et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a way to overcome these problems .",
    "but their proposal implements qubits in the electron spins of the phosphorus atoms .",
    "it is clear that unlike nuclear spins , electron spins can not be isolated from their surroundings .",
    "so , the price of simplification of the original proposal @xcite seems to be very high .    in our previous paper @xcite we proposed the mrfm quantum computer",
    "this proposal relies on rapidly developing mrfm methods which promise single spin detection combining magnetic resonance techniques , atomic force microscopy and novel optical methods for detection of mechanical vibrations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it would be very attractive to apply the idea of the mrfm quantum computer to paramagnetic impurities in silicon .",
    "however , the phosphorus atom does not fit our proposal because the large size of its electron cloud and relatively weak hyperfine interaction . in this paper",
    ", we propose a mrfm quantum computer based on silicon with tellurium impurities .",
    "unlike phosphorus , a tellurium atom in silicon is a `` deep donor '' with a small size of the electron cloud and with extremely large hyperfine interaction .",
    "application of tellurium impurities in silicon could combine advantages of mrfm with well - developed techniques of silicon technology .",
    "ispell tellurium1.tex in section ii , we discuss the design of this quantum computer . in section iii ,",
    "we describe quantum computation using this nuclear spin quantum computer .",
    "we discuss a one - qubit rotation , a two - qubit quantum cn gate , the measurement of the state of a nuclear spin , and the initialization of the nuclear spins in their ground states .",
    "a principal diagram of the proposed quantum computer is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "tellurium-125 donors are placed near the surface of the silicon-28 .",
    "we assume that silicon contains only @xmath2si non - magnetic nuclei . @xmath4si",
    "magnetic nuclei whose natural abundance is 4.7% must be eliminated .",
    "the tellurium contains @xmath5te nuclei , whose natural abundance is only 7% . if a host atom in silicon is replaced by tellurium donor , two extra electrons are available .",
    "the properties of tellurium donors in silicon have been investigated elsewhere .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite and the references therein . )",
    "it was found that most of the implanted tellurium atoms occupy substitutional sites .",
    "the ground states of tellurium donors , as well as those of other atoms with two extra electrons , are referred as `` deep impurity levels '' in contrast to `` shallow '' impurities like phosphorus with one extra electron whose ground state energies are of the order 50 mev . because of the two extra electrons , tellurium donors form singly - ionized a - centers , te@xmath6 , and neutral b - centers , te@xmath7 .",
    "the temperature - independent ground state energies were found in @xcite to be 410.8 mev for a - centers , and 198.8 mev for b - centers .",
    "electron spin resonance ( esr ) for a - centers @xcite can be described by the simple spin hamiltonian , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electron spin ( s=1/2 ) of @xmath5te@xmath6 ; @xmath10 is a nuclear spin ( i=1/2 ) of @xmath5te nuclei ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the bohr and nuclear magnetons , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electron and nuclear @xmath15-factors : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; a is the constant of the isotropic hyperfine ( hf ) interaction , @xmath18 ghz .",
    "the first two terms in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) have the same signs because the nuclear magnetic moment of @xmath5te is negative , as is the electron magnetic moment .",
    "for the same reason , we put in ( 1 ) a negative sign for the hyperfine interaction .",
    "we propose to use as qubits the nuclear spins of the @xmath5te donors ( a - centers ) .",
    "we assume that future advances in silicon technology will allow one to place a regular chain of @xmath5te donors near the surface of silicon with the distance between donors being approximately 5 nm .",
    "( see fig . 1 . ) to initialize the ground states of the nuclear spins and to measure their final states , we propose using mrfm . for this purpose , the ferromagnetic particle , @xmath19 , in fig .",
    "1 , attached to the end of the cantilever , can move along the impurity chain selecting an appropriate tellurium ion . to implement quantum computation , we propose using the same ( but non - vibrating ) ferromagnetic particle which can move along the impurity chain .",
    "next , we shall describe the operation of the proposed quantum computer .",
    "following our proposal @xcite , we assume that electron spins are polarized in the positive @xmath20-direction .",
    "( as an example , for @xmath21 t and at a temperature of 1k , the probability for an electron to change its direction is approximately @xmath22 . ) from the other side , approximately 44% of nuclear spins are in their excited states . to detect these nuclear spins",
    "one moves the ferromagnetic particle placed on the cantilever to a selected tellurium atom .",
    "assuming that the distance between the ferromagnetic particle and the selected ion is 10 nm , the radius of the ferromagnetic particle is 5 nm , and the magnetic induction of the ferromagnetic particle is : @xmath23 t , one finds that the shift of the esr frequency for the selected ion is , @xmath24 ghz .",
    "( the corresponding magnetic field produced by the ferromagnetic particle is approximately @xmath25 t @xcite . )",
    "the `` natural '' esr frequency for @xmath21 t is , @xmath26 ghz .",
    "the hyperfine shift of the esr frequency is , @xmath27 ghz @xcite . for an ion , the magnetic dipole field produced by its two neighbor electron spins",
    "was estimated as @xmath28 t. the magnetic dipole field produced by all other electron spins does not exceed @xmath29 t @xcite .",
    "the corresponding shifts of the esr frequency are , @xmath30 mhz and @xmath31 mhz .",
    "we assume that the amplitude of the _ rf _ pulse , @xmath32 , in frequency units ( the rabi frequency ) is greater than @xmath33 .",
    "so , the dipole contribution to the esr frequency can be ignored .",
    "thus , applying the _ rf _ pulses with the frequency , @xmath34 one induces oscillations of the electron spin of a selective tellurium ion only if the nuclear spin of the ion is in its ground state .",
    "the oscillating electron spin , in turn , induces resonant vibrations of the cantilever which can be detected by mrfm methods .",
    "a discussion on modified mrfm techniques for detection of a single electron spin and related estimates for the mrfm quantum computer can be found in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "thus , tellurium atoms detected by mrfm have their nuclear spins in their ground state .",
    "to drive other nuclear spins to their ground states , one moves the non - vibrating ferromagnetic particle to a selected tellurium atom whose nuclear spin is in the excited state .",
    "the `` natural '' nmr frequency for @xmath5te nuclear spin in an external magnetic field of 10 t is 134.5 mhz .",
    "the hyperfine `` shift '' , @xmath35 ghz is larger than the `` natural '' frequency .",
    "the additional shift caused by the magnetic field of the ferromagnetic particle is , @xmath36 mhz . applying an _ rf _",
    "@xmath37-pulse with frequency , @xmath38 one drives the nuclear spin into its ground state .    in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the frequency , @xmath39 , is the nmr shift caused by the dipole field of the electron spins of the neighbor ions , and @xmath40 is caused by electron spins of all other ions . for @xmath5te , the frequency @xmath41 hz , and @xmath42 hz . applying an _ rf _ pulse with a nuclear rabi frequency larger than @xmath39",
    ", one can neglect the dipole contribution .",
    "the same method can be used to implement a one - qubit rotation . to implement a two - qubit gate , we propose using the magnetic dipole interaction between electron spins of tellurium ions . for this purpose ,",
    "one moves the non - vibrating ferromagnetic particle to a tellurium ion containing a control nuclear spin ( a control qubit ) .",
    "then , one applies an _",
    "pulse with frequency , @xmath43 .",
    "this pulse drives the electron spin into its excited state if the control nuclear spin is in the ground state .",
    "next , one moves the non - vibrating ferromagnetic particle to the tellurium ion containing the target nuclear spin ( a target qubit ) .",
    "now , it is important to use a selective _ rf _ pulse whose frequency is , @xmath44 and whose rabi frequency is less than 200 hz .",
    "this pulse changes the state of the target nuclear spin if the dipole contribution from neighbor electron spins cancels out : @xmath45 .",
    "it happens only if the control nuclear spin was in the ground state .",
    "finally , one moves the non - vibrating ferromagnetic particle back to the ion containing the control nuclear spin and applies a @xmath37-pulse with the frequency ( 2 ) , to return the electron spin in the ground state ( if it was in the excited state ) .",
    "thus , three _ rf _",
    "pulses together implement an `` inverse '' quantum cn gate : the target qubit changes its state if the control qubit is in the ground state . to implement the `` standard '' quantum cn gate one can apply a _ rf _",
    "@xmath37-pulse with the frequency ( 3 ) . in this case , the target nuclear spin changes its direction if the electron spin of the neighbor ion did not change its state , i.e. if the control nuclear spin was in the excited state .",
    "the final measurement of the nuclear state can be implemented using mrfm in the same way as the measurement of the initial nuclear states .",
    "we describe a mrfm nuclear spin quantum computer using tellurium-125 singly ionized donors placed near the surface of silicon-28 .",
    "our proposal relies on the expected advances in mrfm which promises the detection of a single electron and it relies on further developments in silicon technology .",
