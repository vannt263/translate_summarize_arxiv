    "the edge between classical and quantum description of a phenomenon is related to the interactions occurring between the system under investigation and its environment . as a consequence ,",
    "if we could , in ideal conditions , avoid irreversible interactions among them we should observe the emergence of quantum behavior even in macroscopic systems . as a matter of fact , the technological developments of the recent years have made it possible to start inquiring into the quantum limit even in mesoscopic mechanical systems and experiments have been designed which realize a solid state analogue of cavity quantum electrodynamics .",
    "many of these experiments focus on detecting the quantization of vibrational modes in a mechanical oscillator @xcite .",
    "experimental conditions such that a mechanical object may behave in a quantum fashion are achieved in the low temperature regime .",
    "for example , for a single vibrational mode of energy @xmath0 to show quantum features , as the quantization of lattice vibrations , temperatures @xmath1 are required , which for a micro - sized object oscillating in the microwave band correspond to few mk .",
    "in this framework it has become increasingly relevant to have a precise determination of the temperature .",
    "however , for a quantum system in equilibrium with a thermal bath , there is no linear operator that acts as an observable for temperature .",
    "temperature , thought as a macroscopic manifestation of random energy exchanges between particles , still retains its meaning but we have lost any operational definition .",
    "this kind of impediment often occurs in physics , and especially in quantum mechanics , whenever one is interested in quantities which are not directly accessible , i.e. they do not correspond to observable quantities",
    ". this may either be due to experimental impossibilities , or be a matter of principle , as it happens for nonlinear functions of the density operator . in both cases",
    ", it turns out that the only way to gain some knowledge about the quantity of interest is to measure one or more proper observables somehow related to the parameter we are interested in , and upon suitably processing the outcomes , to come back and infer its value .",
    "hence , any conceivable strategy aimed to evaluate the quantity of interest ultimately reduces to a parameter estimation problem .",
    "relevant examples of this situation are given by estimation of the quantum phase of a harmonic oscillator @xcite , the amount of entanglement of a bipartite quantum state @xcite and the coupling constants of different kinds of interactions @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the estimation of temperature @xcite and , motivated by recent experimental achievements @xcite , we specifically refer to schemes where a micromechanical resonator is coupled to a superconducting qubit , and then a measurement of the excited state population is performed on the qubit itself . from the statistics of the population measurement is then possible to obtain information about the oscillator state , e.g. infer how close it is to the ground state , and in turn its temperature .    in this context",
    "an optimization problem naturally arises , aimed at finding the most efficient inference procedure leading to minimum fluctuations in the temperature estimate . in this paper",
    "we address this problem in the framework of local quantum estimation theory ( qet ) @xcite .",
    "we solve the dynamics of the qubit - resonator coupled system and , in order to match realistic scenarios , we also take into account an effective model for non dissipative decoherence .",
    "then , we evaluate the fisher information ( fi ) for the estimation of temperature via population measurement ( hereafter referred to as the fi _ of the population measurement _ ) and find both the optimal initial qubit preparation and the smallest temperature value that can be discriminated .",
    "moreover , we evaluate the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) in terms of the symmetric logarithmic derivative in order to calculate the ultimate bound to precision allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "this enable us to show that population measurement is indeed optimal for a suitable choice of the initial preparation of the qubit , and to provide quantum benchmarks for temperature estimation .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that we are not discussing here temperature fluctuations in a thermodynamical setting .",
    "although temperature itself may not fluctuate , as it is suggested by quantum thermodynamical approaches @xcite , we expect that fluctuations always appear in the temperature estimates coming from indirect measurements @xcite .",
    "quantum estimation theory provides the tools to evaluate lower bounds to the amount of fluctuations for a given measurement , as well as the ultimate bounds imposed by quantum mechanics .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec . [",
    "s : model ] we describe the interaction model : first we briefly review the unitary jaynes - cummings dynamics for the coupled system and describe the measurements performed on the qubit , and then we take into account the decoherence effects . in sec . [",

    "the temperature of a physical object can not be directly measurable .",
    "on the other hand is can be regarded as a parameter whose value can be indirectly inferred by measuring some proper observable and then suitably processing the outcomes , an inference procedure usually referred to as an estimation procedure . in the case of a micromechanical oscillator with an isolated vibrational mode , effective schemes have been suggested and realized @xcite which rely on coupling the resonator to a superconducting qubit and probing the latter using population measurements . in other words ,",
    "the qubit is employed as a quantum thermometer to demonstrate that the resonator has been cooled to its quantum ground state . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed in details qubit thermometry in these systems , i.e. , the estimation of temperature via quantum limited measurements performed on the qubit . in the framework of quantum estimation theory",
    "we have analyzed precision as a function of both the qubit initial preparation and the interaction parameters , and we have evaluated the limits to precision posed by quantum mechanics to qubit thermometry .    we have computed the fi for population measurement , which is the appropriate figure of merit to assess the precision of estimation , and have found that its maximum , and hence the minimum variance in the estimated temperature , is achieved by preparing the qubit in the ground state , and probing it at an emergent time @xmath124 , which is predictable .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed in details how the maximum depends on the temperature itself , on the detuning , and on the noise parameter when one takes into account non dissipative decoherence . in order to evaluate the ultimate bound allowed by quantum mechanics to the sensitivity of temperature estimation",
    ", we have also computed the quantum fisher information .",
    "we found that qfi is maximized for the same choice of qubit preparation and measurement time of the fi , and that for these common values the maxima of fi and qfi coincide .",
    "we thus conclude that population measurement is optimal for temperature estimation .",
    "the range of parameters addressed in our analysis is that of recent experimental implementations @xcite . we thus conclude that optimal estimation of temperature can be done with current technology .",
    "since the fi of population measurement , and the qfi of the model , both decrease with the decrease of temperature , the estimation of lower temperature will be intrinsically less precise . on the other hand , since the are regimes , also in the presence of decoherence , where the maxima of the fi and the qfi are reasonably smooth as a function of the qubit preparation and of the interaction time we do not expect any `` no - go '' theorem for temperature estimation . in other words , we expect that optimal estimation of lower resonator temperatures , perhaps achievable with further experimental advances , will be still possible with population measurements . on the other hand , `` optimality",
    "'' will correspond to an inherently less precise procedure compared to the case of higher temperature .",
    "our analysis shows the optimality of feasible qubit thermometry in providing quantum benchmarks for high precision temperature measurement , as well as an efficient operational quantification of temperature for mechanical modes lying arbitrary close to their ground state .",
    "in other words , achievement of the ultimate bound to precision allowed by quantum mechanics is in the capabilities of the current technology .",
    "our results also confirm that qet is a useful tool for assessing and comparing inference procedures arising in quantum limited measurements @xcite , even when mesoscopic objects are involved .",
