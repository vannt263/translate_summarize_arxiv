    "in its quest to find black holes throughout the universe , the _ energetic x - ray imaging survey telescope ( exist ) _ will detect , localize and study a large number of gamma - ray bursts , events thought to result from the birth of stellar - mass black holes .",
    "we present the methods used to calculate _ exist _",
    "s capabilities as a gamma - ray burst detector ; we use the _ exist _ design evaluated by the national research council s ` committee on nasa s beyond einstein program : an architecture for implementation ' ( 2007 ; see also grindlay 2007 ) .",
    "the combination of large detector area , broad energy coverage , and wide field - of - view ( fov ) will result in the detection of a substantial number of bursts with a flux distribution extending to fainter fluxes than that of previous missions .",
    "thus _ exist _ should detect high redshift bursts , perhaps even bursts resulting from the death of pop  iii stars .",
    "_ exist _ s imaging detectors will localize the bursts , while the combination of detectors , both imaging and non - imaging , will result in well - determined spectra from 3  kev to well over 10  mev .    in this paper",
    "we first describe the _ exist _ mission design (  2 ) , emphasizing aspects relevant to burst detection",
    ". then we present the sensitivity methodology (  3 ) , which we apply to the individual coded mask sub - telescopes (  4 ) .",
    "_ exist _ will consist of arrays of these detectors with overlapping fovs , and the overall mission sensitivity results from adding the sensitivity of the individual sub - telescopes (  5 ) .",
    "imaging using counts accumulated over different timescales increases the sensitivity (  6 ) . finally , we combine these different calculations to evaluate _ exist _",
    "s overall capabilities to study bursts (  7 ) .",
    "the _ exist _ design analyzed here was proposed as the black hole finder probe for nasa s beyond einstein program . in this design , described in grindlay ( 2007 ) , the mission consists of two arrays of sub - telescopes .",
    "the 19  high energy telescopes ( hets ) will use a cadmium  zinc  telluride ( czt ) detector plane , while the 32  low energy telescopes ( lets ) will use a silicon detector plane .",
    "the spacecraft will be launched into low earth orbit ( @xmath1500  km ) by either a atlas  v-551 ( for an orbital inclination of @xmath2 ) or a delta  iv  4050h ( @xmath3 ) for a 5 ( minimum)10 ( goal ) year mission .",
    "the csi active shielding for the czt detectors will also be instrumented to provide spectral coverage for gamma - ray bursts at higher energies .",
    "table  1 provides the detector parameters relevant to this study .",
    "the spacecraft pointing will rock @xmath4 perpendicular to the orbit around the zenith , resulting in nearly uniform sky coverage and sensitivity .",
    "both the hets and lets will image the gamma - ray sky using the coded mask technique .",
    "the detector plane ` sees ' the sky through a mask with open and closed cells that is a fixed distance above the detector plane .",
    "therefore a source in the fov casts a shadow with the mask s pattern on the detector plane .",
    "the distribution of sources on the sky is deconvolved from the counts detected by the position sensitive detectors .",
    "sources in the central part of the fov , the ` fully coded ' region , illuminate the full detector plane , while sources further out in the fov , the ` partially coded ' region , illuminate only a fraction of the detector plane .",
    "the dimensions of the detector plane and mask , and the detector - mask distance , determine the fov , while the detector - mask distance and the dimensions of the mask cells and detector pixels fix the angular resolution .",
    "as for _ swift _ and _ glast _ , _ exist _ will run burst detection and localization software onboard ( the fast onboard burst alert system  fobas ) , and telemeter data to the ground for further analysis . in the current design",
    ", fobas will run both rate and image triggers on the datastream from both the het and let sub - telescopes .",
    "rate triggers will search for statistically significant increases in the count rates from the sub - telescopes .",
    "the image triggers will form images from the counts from the individual sub - telescopes , add the images , and search the resulting sky image for a new , statistically significant point source . in the current design",
    ", images will be formed with 3 , 18 , 108 , 648 and 1296  s accumulation times .",
    "when a burst is detected , _ exist _ will downlink the burst time and location ( as well as other basic burst parameters ) through the tracking and data relay satellite system ( tdrss ) within @xmath520  s , as is done for _ swift _ and will be done for glast .",
    "data indicating the time , energy and pixel of every het and let count , as well as other standard science and housekeeping data , will be downlinked approximately every four hours through a tdrss ku band link , as will be done for glast .",
    "ground software will calculate more accurate sky positions and other parameters ( e.g. , durations and spectra ) for the bursts detected onboard , and will search the datastream for bursts that fobas did not detect",
    ".    the active csi shields behind the het detector plane and in the lower part of the het collimators will be instrumented to provide 64 channel spectra between @xmath1300  kev to @xmath110  mev ( see garson et al .",
    "the current plan is that spectra accumulated every 1  s will be downlinked . by buffering the counts from the shields",
    ", the count binning will be increased to every 0.1  s for the time period 500  s before to 500  s after the trigger .",
    "a burst will be detected by _ exist _ when a statistically significant new source is found in either an het or let image of the sky .",
    "the same criterion applies to _ swift _",
    "s bat ( a single czt coded mask detector ) and therefore the sensitivity analysis we use follows the methodology applied to the bat in band ( 2006 ) .",
    "formation of the image in which the burst is detected may be initiated by either a rate or image trigger .",
    "a rate trigger will search the count rates from the sub - telescopes for a statistically significant increase .",
    "an image trigger will search for new sources in images of the sky that will be formed continuously .",
    "the new source in an image trigger may not be statistically significant , but will indicate that a burst may be in progress .",
    "after either a rate or image trigger , fobas ( the burst flight software ) will vary the time and energy ranges over which counts are accumulated to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "an image will then be formed from these counts .",
    "the threshold for these initial rate or image triggers will be sufficiently loose to allow many triggers ; the absence of a statistically significant point source in the final image will weed out the false positives .",
    "note that the final image in which the point source is most significant may be formed from the counts in a different energy and time bin than that of the counts that initially triggered fobas .",
    "regardless of the process leading to the final image , _ exist _ s burst sensitivity will be the minimum burst flux that results in a statistically significant point source in an het or let image .",
    "this is the basis of our analysis . in this section",
    "we calculate the sensitivity for a point source in the center of the fov of a single sub - telescope , and in  5 we consider how this sensitivity varies across the sub - telescope arrays fov .",
    "skinner ( 2007 ) derived the source detection sensitivity of a coded mask system when standard assumptions are relaxed : the fraction of the open mask pixels may differ from 1/2 ; part of an open mask pixel may be occulted ( e.g. , by ribs around each pixel to support the _ exist _ masks ) ; the detector pixels may not be small relative to the mask pixels ; the source strength may be comparable to the background ; and the closed mask pixels may be partially transparent ( e.g. , at high energy ) . here",
    "we will consider the background - dominated case .",
    "consider an image formed using counts accumulated over @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the burst spectrum is @xmath8 ( ph @xmath9 s@xmath10 kev@xmath10 ) .",
    "let @xmath11 be the source flux averaged over @xmath6 and integrated over @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath12 let the average detector efficiency be @xmath13 where @xmath14 the detector efficiency . at high energy photons leak through the closed mask pixels .",
    "define an effective detector efficiency for flux through the closed mask pixels @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the optical depth through the closed mask elements .",
    "note that @xmath17 includes absorption by all material over the entire detector , while @xmath16 accounts only for absorption through the closed mask pixels .    for the hets garson et al .",
    "( 2006b , c ) find that the photon aperture flux from the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) dominates the background below @xmath18  kev , while at higher energy sources such as earth albedo photons , charged particles and activation dominate the background . for the lets the background results primarily from the cxb .",
    "the cxb contribution can be modelled semi - analytically , while other background sources require complex monte carlo calculations .",
    "thus we model the total background count rate per detector area as @xmath19 + b(e ) \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the fraction of the mask area that is open , @xmath21 is the cxb ( gruber 1992 ) , @xmath22 is the projected solid angle subtended by the detector s aperture averaged over the detector plane ( calculated with the corrected formulae of sullivan [ 1971 ] ) , and @xmath23 models the other sources of background .",
    "the aperture flux includes the leakage of the cxb through the closed mask elements at high energy .",
    "the significance of the burst s image in the background - dominated case is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the detector area , and @xmath26 includes the factors resulting from the ribs around the mask pixels , the fraction of the mask pixels that are open , and the finite detector size . for open mask pixels where the ribs cover 0.2 of the pixel area and detector - to - mask pixel ratios of 1/2 ( het ) and 1 ( let ) , @xmath27 and 0.564 , respectively .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the burst flux in terms of @xmath28 where @xmath29=11000  kev .    to understand the effect of transparency through the closed mask pixels , we define the mask factors @xmath30 ( relevant to the factor of @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 ( relevant to the aperture flux ) .",
    "a decrease in @xmath33 results in a decrease in the detection significance , while an increase in @xmath34 indicates an increase in the aperture flux .",
    "the gamma - ray burst spectrum is modelled using the four - parameter ` band ' function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) : a low energy power law with an exponential rolloff ( @xmath35 $ ] ) that merges smoothly with a high energy power law ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the break between the two power laws is characterized by @xmath37 , which is the energy of the maximum of @xmath38 if @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 is the photon energy where most of the energy is radiated .",
    "we use the flux @xmath41 ( ph  s@xmath10  @xmath9 ) integrated over the 11000  kev band to normalize the spectrum ( see eq .  6 ) .",
    "thus the spectrum is characterized by the normalization @xmath41 , the two spectral indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and the energy @xmath40 .",
    "eq .  5 can be inverted to find the threshold value of @xmath41 at the peak of the lightcurve for a given set of the spectral parameters that determine the shape of the burst spectrum  the spectral indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and the peak energy @xmath40 .",
    "the result is a surface in the four dimensional space given by these spectral parameters ; bursts with spectra on one side of this surface ( with @xmath41 greater than the value on the surface ) will be detected , while bursts on the other side will not . holding the spectral indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 fixed projects this surface into a sensitivity curve in the @xmath41-@xmath40 plane .",
    "the curve also depends on the accumulation time @xmath6 ( here @xmath44 ) .",
    "the dependence of the sensitivity on the accumulation time is discussed below (  6 ) .",
    "note that the threshold value of @xmath41 at a given @xmath40 is _ not _ the sensitivity of the detector at a photon energy equal to @xmath40 .",
    "the power of sensitivity curves in the @xmath41-@xmath40 plane is that they show the detectability of a burst with a given set of spectral parameters , and thus the sensitivity of different detectors can be compared , regardless of their specific energy response .",
    "a czt - based detector that detects photons in the 10150  kev band can be compared to a scintillator - based detector that detects photons in the 50300  kev band .",
    "a single het will have a 56  cm @xmath45 56  cm ( an area of 3136  @xmath46 ) czt detector plane that is 5  mm thick .",
    "the platinum and gold cathode pads on the czt ( @xmath47    each ) , the mylar thermal blankets ( two  @xmath48  mil blankets ) and the kevlar micrometeriod shield ( @xmath15  mil ) in the current design produce negligible absorption @xmath49  kev .",
    "figure  1 shows the efficiency of the czt detectors as a function of energy .",
    "we calculate the mask factors ( eqs .",
    "7 and 8) using the optical depth through a 5  mm thick , 107.9  cm @xmath45 107.9  cm plate of tungsten .",
    "because of the supports necessary for the closed mask pixels , we assume an open fraction of @xmath20 = 0.4 . figure  2 shows the resulting mask factors as a function of energy for both the nominal 5  mm thickness ( solid curve ) and for a mask with half this thickness ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the linear dimensions of the detector and mask pixels will be 0.125  cm and 0.25  cm , respectively . for a detector to mask pixel dimension ratio of 1:2",
    "the factor compensating for the finite size of the detector pixels is @xmath27 ( see eq .  5 ) .",
    "the background is modelled ( eq .",
    "4 ) as the sum of the cxb aperture flux and the continuum background from other sources ( see garson et al . 2006b , c for details ) . figure  3 shows the resulting background .",
    "we assume that counts are accumulated over two energy bands @xmath7 = 10600 and 40600  kev .",
    "the 10600  kev band is sensitive to soft bursts , where the large number of low energy burst counts compensates for the large aperture flux , while the 40600  kev band is particularly sensitive to hard bursts where there are sufficient burst photons above 40  kev .",
    "the required threshold significance is assumed to be @xmath50 ( the same as the bat s threshold ) .",
    "figure  4 shows the sensitivity curve for a single het sub - telescope for three sets of spectral indices and for @xmath6=1  s.    the survey will localize sources to better than 56  arcsec ( grindlay 2007 ) .",
    "the survey s threshold will be 5@xmath51 whereas the burst threshold will be 7@xmath51 , and typically localization is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "thus we estimate that the het s localizations will be better than 40  arcsec .",
    "as currently designed , a single let will have a 20  cm @xmath45 20  cm ( an area of 400  @xmath46 ) , 1  mm thick si detector plane with 0.02  cm pixels .",
    "figure  1 also shows the let efficiency",
    ". the mask will be 72  cm above the si detector plane , with collimators extending from the detector plane to the mask .",
    "the 20  cm @xmath45 20  cm mask will have a thickness of 0.05  mm and 0.02  cm pixels .",
    "again , because of the need to support the closed mask pixels , we assume an open fraction of @xmath20=0.4 . over the let s energy range ( 3 to 30  kev ) the closed mask pixels will be optically thick . with a mask to detector pixel ratio of 1:1 , the mask factor in eq .",
    "5 is @xmath53=0.564 .",
    "although we include an internal background of @xmath54 cts @xmath9 kev@xmath10 s@xmath10 in our calculation , the background is almost entirely the result of the cxb aperture flux ; see figure  3 .",
    "we assume a threshold image significance of @xmath55 will be required over a single trigger energy band of @xmath7= 330  kev .",
    "figure  4 shows the resulting sensitivity .",
    "note that the lets are less sensitive than the hets .",
    "the slopes of the het and let sensitivity curves are consistent with the energy dependence of the let and het detectors .",
    "the exist survey s localizations should be better than 11 arcsec ( grindlay 2007 ) , and thus accounting for the difference in survey and burst thresholds ( 5@xmath51 vs. 7@xmath51 ) , the let s burst localizations should be better than 8  arcsec .",
    "the arrays of het and let sub - telescopes will each cover a very large total fov . any point in these total fovs will be in the fully- or partially - coded fovs of a number of sub - telescopes .",
    "the resulting multi - detector sensitivity across the arrays fovs will depend on how the images from the different detectors will be added together ; this merging will depend on the exigencies of the available computational power and the required data latency .",
    "specifically , burst detection and localization on - board the _ exist _ spacecraft by radiation - hardened processors will probably be less sensitive than on the ground , where farms of high - speed processors will be available .",
    "in addition , localization on - board must be rapid so that telescopes on the ground can begin following the burst afterglow .",
    "the calculations above provide the on - axis sensitivity for single het or let sub - telescopes .",
    "let @xmath56 be the ratio of the actual sensitivity at a given point in the fov to this single sub - telescope on - axis sensitivity , where sensitivity is proportional to @xmath57 ( see eq .",
    "5 ) or to the inverse of the threshold peak flux @xmath41 . thus larger @xmath56 means a greater significance for a given peak flux or a smaller threshold peak flux for a given significance .",
    "the source flux falling on the detector plane is only a fraction @xmath58 of the flux it would have on - axis , where @xmath59 is the ` coding fraction ' which accounts for the partial shadowing of the detector plane by the collimators ( the detector sides ) and @xmath60 is the inclination angle ( the angle between the source direction and the detector normal ) . the non - source flux that contributes to the background around the source is proportional to the ` coding fraction ' @xmath59 . in",
    "coded mask imaging only the counts in the region of the detector plane that is not shadowed for a given source contribute to the image around the source .",
    "the source flux that impinges on this region is foreshortened by the inclination angle ( the ` @xmath61 ' effect ) , but the background in this region does not depend on the source s direction . for a single sub - telescope",
    "the ratio of the off - axis to on - axis significance is therefore @xmath62 .",
    "the methodology by which the data from multiple detectors will be combined is currently being studied .",
    "first , the images can be added .",
    "then the source flux is proportional to @xmath63 , the background to @xmath64 , and thus @xmath65 /\\sqrt{\\sum f_{c , i}}$ ] .",
    "alternatively , forming images for each sub - telescope and adding the significances for the common point sources in quadrature gives @xmath66 .",
    "in practice for the het and let arrays the sensitivity over the fov for these two methods differ very little , and we use @xmath67 .    to calculate the sensitivity over the fov , we work , and plot results , in a coordinate system that is a projection of the spherical sky directly onto a plane perpendicular to the zenith , i.e. , if a point on the sky has the coordinates @xmath68,@xmath69,@xmath70 ( where @xmath71 ) , then we work in the @xmath68-@xmath69 plane . in this coordinate system",
    ", @xmath70 is along the spacecraft s zenith , @xmath68 is along the direction of orbital motion , and the spacecraft nods ( rocks ) in the @xmath69 direction .",
    "we calculate @xmath67 at different points on this grid .",
    "figure  5 shows the burst sensitivity over the sky for the het and let arrays ; the maxima are just under twice the sensitivities ( i.e. , more sensitive than ) of single het and let sub - telescopes .",
    "figure  6 shows the amount of solid angle at a given sensitivity for both arrays .",
    "thus different points in the overall fov will have different sensitivity thresholds , which must be considered when analyzing the cumulative intensity distribution .",
    "figure  7 shows the low end of the cumulative intensity distribution resulting from variations in the threshold over the fov ; other effects that smooth the threshold are ignored , and therefore the effect demonstrated by this figure applies to any burst intensity distribution .",
    "note that the sensitivity of _ swift _ s bat also varies over the fov , affecting the shape of the cumulative fluence or peak flux distributions .",
    "the het and let sensitivity curves presented in figure  4 assumed @xmath6=1  s , i.e. , that the bursts were detected in images formed over 1  s. however , modern burst detectors ( e.g. , _ swift _ s bat , the glast burst monitor and _ exist _ ) usually use a number of different accumulation times . for an imaging detector",
    "the relevant @xmath6 is the accumulation time for the final image .",
    "an accumulation time comparable to the burst duration will usually maximize the source significance . a longer accumulation time will dilute the signal with background , reducing the signal - to - noise ratio , and therefore the significance of the detection .",
    "on the other hand , a shorter accumulation time will often exclude signal that could have increased the significance of the burst detection .",
    "quantitative analysis of the dependence of burst sensitivity on the accumulation time is difficult because of the large range of burst durations and the great diversity of burst lightcurves .",
    "some bursts consist of contiguous , overlapping pulses while others have widely separated pulses . band ( 2002 ) ran a software rate trigger with a wide range of @xmath6 values on the lightcurves of 100 bright batse bursts , and determined that using a range of @xmath6 values would increase the burst detection rate by @xmath125% over the rate for @xmath6=1  s. band ( 2006 ) explained the larger fraction of long duration bursts relative to short duration bursts in the _ swift _ data set compared to batse s as resulting in part from _ swift _ s long accumulation times .    as a demonstration of the increase in sensitivity afforded by using a variety of accumulation times , consider a burst lightcurve with an exponential shape , @xmath72 $ ] ; the traditional duration of 90% of the emission is @xmath73 . in this example the accumulation time is assumed to begin at @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be the threshold peak flux averaged over 1  s ( this is the quantity plotted in figure  4 for @xmath6=1  s ) for a given @xmath6 .",
    "then the ratio of threshold peak fluxes for two different accumulation times @xmath76 and @xmath77 is @xmath78}\\over{1-\\exp[-\\delta t_1/t ] } } \\quad .\\ ] ] if a detector uses a set of @xmath6 values , then the smallest value of @xmath75 should be used for any given value of @xmath79 .",
    "we assume we are in the background - dominated case ( eq .  5 ) ; the detectability of very short bursts might be limited by a paucity of source counts .",
    "figure  8 shows this ratio for @xmath76=1  s and different sets of @xmath77 .",
    "thus this figure shows how the sensitivity of a mission such as _ exist _ to short and long duration bursts is increased by using a variety of accumulation times .",
    "the dashed curve assumes @xmath77=1  s , and thus the ratio is equal to 1 .",
    "currently _ exist _ s planned imaging trigger ( which is _ not _ the final imaging step in _ exist _ s burst detection process ) will use @xmath77=\\{3 , 18 , 108 , 648 and 1296 }  s ; this is shown by the solid curve . finally ,",
    "@xmath77 may be varied to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , minimizing @xmath80 to the smallest possible value ; this is shown by the dot - dashed curve .",
    "if burst lightcurves could be described by the exponential shape of this example ( and bursts did not undergo spectral evolution , which makes the duration energy - dependent ) , then the het or let threshold peak flux of a burst of a given peak energy @xmath40 and duration @xmath81 would be the product of @xmath41 from figure  4 and the ratio from figure  8 .",
    "we emphasize that this is a highly idealized example meant to demonstrate how the variable accumulation times of _ exist _ s burst detection system will increase the sensitivity to long and short duration bursts .",
    "this is particularly relevant to high redshift bursts whose durations will be time - dilated .",
    "from the preceding analysis , we can draw several conclusions on _ exist _ s impact on the study of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "first we estimate the _ exist _ burst detection rate .",
    "the batse observations provide the cumulative burst rate as a function of the peak flux value @xmath82 averaged over @xmath44  s in the @xmath8350300  kev band ( band 2002 ) : @xmath84^{-0.8 } \\hbox { bursts yr$^{-1}$ sky$^{-1}$ } \\quad .\\ ] ] the het threshold sensitivity for a single sub - telescope on - axis is @xmath85  ph  @xmath9  s@xmath10 for @xmath86  kev . using the batse rate in eq .  10 and integrating over the solid angle distribution in figure  6 gives a burst detection rate for the het of @xmath87 bursts per year .",
    "note that this rate is over the batse - specific values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , and _ exist _ will use at least two different values of @xmath7 ( see  4.1 ) and a variety of @xmath6 values ( see  6 ) .",
    "consequently this rate should be increased by approximately 50% to account for the soft , faint , long duration bursts to which batse was less sensitive than _ exist _",
    "s het will be ; we therefore expect the het array to detect @xmath88  bursts per year .",
    "the value of @xmath82 for an let varies more with the burst spectral parameters than for an het , and therefore estimates of the let burst detection rate based on the batse rate are much more uncertain . for a single let @xmath89  ph  @xmath9  s@xmath10 on axis at @xmath90  kev , which gives a burst detection rate of @xmath1180 bursts per year using eq .",
    "10 and the let distribution in figure  6 . this rate should be increased by a factor of 2 to account for the different energy band @xmath7 and accumulation times @xmath6 .",
    "we use a larger adjustment factor for the lets than for the hets because the lets energy band will overlap less with batse s than the hets. we therefore expect the let array to detect @xmath91  bursts per year .",
    "next we simulate the spectra that the _ exist _ suite of detectors will observe .",
    "figure  9 shows a count spectrum ( counts s@xmath10 kev@xmath10 ) for a moderately strong burst as it might be observed by the lets ( lefthand set of curves ) , hets ( middle set ) and the csi active shields for the hets ( righthand set ; based on garson et al .",
    "the solid curves show the signal count rate , while the dashed curves provide the estimated background .",
    "thus _ exist _ will facilitate spectral - temporal studies .",
    "particularly important to physical burst emission models is determining @xmath40 , which is typically of order 250  kev ( kaneko et al .",
    "in addition , correlations of @xmath40 with other burst properties , such as the ` isotropic ' energy ( the amati relation  amati 2006 ) or total energy ( the ghirlanda relation  ghirlanda , ghisellini & lazzati 2004 ) , have been proposed . `",
    "pseudo - redshifts ' calculated from the observables related to the burst - frame parameters in these relations can be used in burst studies when spectroscopic redshifts are not available , and can guide ground observers in allocating telescope time to observing potential high redshift bursts . the recently proposed firmani relation ( firmani et al .",
    "2006 ) correlates @xmath40 , the peak luminosity , and a measure of the burst duration , all of which are related to observables in the gamma ray band .",
    "thus pseudo - redshifts will be estimated using the firmani relation based on _ exist _ data alone , independent of observations by other facilities .    with well determined broadband spectra down to 3  kev ,",
    "_ exist _ will be capable of determining whether the band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) suffices to describe burst spectra .",
    "for example , preece et al . ( 1996 ) found evidence in the batse data for the presence of additional emission below 10  kev .    by scaling from the exist survey s source localization ( grindlay 2007 )",
    ", we find that bursts should be localized at threshold by the hets and lets to better than 40  arcsec and 8  arcsec , respectively ; this localization should scale as @xmath92 .",
    "because the hets are more sensitive to the lets , the het localization is relevant to the faintest bursts exist will detect .",
    "s burst capabilities calculated above will constitute a major leap beyond current detectors , and should increase the number of high redshift bursts detected . on average , high redshift bursts should be fainter , softer and longer than low redshift bursts ( although the broad burst luminosity function and great variety in burst lightcurves and spectra obscure this trend ) .",
    "figure  10 compares the detector sensitivities of the het ( solid curve ) and let ( dashed curve ) arrays to the bat on _ swift _ ( dot - dashed curve ) and batse s large area detector ( lad  dot - dot - dashed curve ) . as discussed above , the sensitivity is the threshold peak flux @xmath41 integrated over the 11000  kev band as a function of the spectrum s @xmath40 ; @xmath93 and @xmath94 are assumed .",
    "in addition , the figure shows families of identical bursts at different redshifts ( the curves with the points marked by ` + ' ) .",
    "each family is defined by the value of @xmath40 in the burst frame ; here again @xmath93 and @xmath94 are assumed .",
    "in each family the burst would be observed to have @xmath41=7.5 ph @xmath9 s@xmath10 if it were at @xmath95 .",
    "the points marked by ` + ' are spaced every @xmath96 ; thus the uppermost points are at @xmath95 and the lowermost points are at @xmath97 .",
    "the pulses in burst lightcurves become narrower ( shorter ) at higher energy , an effect that is generally proportional to @xmath98 ( fenimore et al .",
    "since the observed lightcurve originated in a higher energy band , pulses should become narrower with redshift , reducing the peak flux when integrated over a fixed accumulation time ; the plotted families include this effect . finally , in  6 we showed that forming images on long timescales increases the sensitivity to long duration bursts , as might result from cosmological time dilation .",
    "we presented our method for analyzing the gamma - ray burst sensitivity of _ exist _ , and applied it to the design for the beyond einstein program ; this methodology will be used to guide and evaluate the evolving mission design . with two arrays of coded mask detectors covering the 330  kev ( si ) and 10600  kev ( czt ) bands and non - imaging high energy csi detectors ( 0.210  mev ) ,",
    "_ exist _ will be a significant gamma - ray burst observatory .",
    "_ exist _ will detect and localize @xmath99 bursts per day , observing their spectra from 3  kev to over 10  mev . for bursts with comparable spectra and lightcurves _ exist _ will be approximately four times more sensitive than _ swift _ s bat with a much larger fov . with these capabilities ,",
    "_ exist _ will accumulate a large sample of bursts with well determined properties such as @xmath40 and redshift , facilitating physical modelling and population studies , and realizing the potential of gamma - ray bursts as cosmological probes .",
