    "an unsolved problem in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback on clusters is how to account for the the morphology and stability of buoyant bubbles and their interactions with the ambient intracluster medium ( icm ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that in the perseus cluster , such bubbles can stay intact far from cluster centers where they were inflated by agn jets .",
    "however , studies of kinetic - energy dominated jets in the purely hydrodynamic limit did not explain the observed long term persistence of the buoyant bubbles , which are prone to rayleigh - taylor ( rti ) and kelvin - holmhotz ( khi ) instabilities and fragment entirely within @xmath5 , contrary to observations [ but see @xcite ]",
    ".    appreciable magnetic energy has been observed in both cluster and radio lobe plasmas @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fields could play a vital role in the dynamics of the rising bubble , as shown by a series of 2d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) studies for bubbles of several @xmath6  years @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that uniform strong magnetic fields do not suppress rti completely , but sheared fields at the bubble interface quench the instability .",
    "this implies that not only the field strength but also the configuration matters for bubble stability .",
    "@xcite did a comprehensive study of the influence of different magnetic field configurations upon the stability of a rising bubble .",
    "they found that the internal bubble helical magnetic field moderately stabilizes the bubble , however the bubble has an initial plasma parameter @xmath7 , still in thermal energy - dominated regime .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a different bubble magnetic field configuration for jet / lobes . here",
    "we adopt the field configuration of @xcite and focus on the late stage of the evolution of magnetically dominated bubbles in 3d .",
    "we show that this spheromak - like magnetic field configuration strongly stabilizes the instabilities and prevents the bubble from breaking up , possibly forming the intact but detached  ghost cavity \" observed in systems such as perseus - a .",

    "[ setup ] , we describe the problem setup .",
    "the simulation results and discussions are given in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "the background icm is assumed to be hydrostatic and isothermal .",
    "the density and pressure profile is given as @xmath8^{-\\kappa}$ ] , where the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are taken to be @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the fixed yet distributed gravitational field @xmath13 dominated by the dark matter is assumed @xcite .",
    "we simulate only the phase after the agn has inflated a low - density bubble which is in pressure equilibrium with the icm initially .",
    "the static magnetized bubble initially lies at @xmath14 with density @xmath15 , spherical radius @xmath16 for the density profile and @xmath17 for the magnetic configuration .",
    "the specific heat @xmath18 inside and outside the bubble is taken to be @xmath19 .",
    "physical quantities are normalized by the characteristic system length scale @xmath20 , density @xmath21 , and velocity @xmath22 .",
    "the initial sound speed , @xmath23 , is constant throughout the computational domain .",
    "other quantities are normalized as : time @xmath24 gives @xmath25 , magnetic field @xmath26 gives @xmath27 and energy @xmath28 gives @xmath29 .",
    "the magnetic field setup of the bubble follows @xcite with the ratio of toroidal to poloidal bubble field @xmath30 taken to be @xmath31 , which corresponds to a minimum initial lorentz force .",
    "the latter is reasonable since we want to mimic the situation that the magnetic bubble has substantially relaxed and detached from the jet tip .",
    "the initial total magnetic energy is around @xmath32 .",
    "the computational domain is taken to be @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 corresponding to a @xmath36 box in the actual length scales . the numerical resolution used here",
    "is @xmath37 , where the grid points are assigned uniformly in every direction .",
    "a cell @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath39 .",
    "we use  outflow \" boundary conditions at every boundary except the boundary at @xmath40 , where we use  reflecting \" boundary conditions , which guarantee that the energy flux through this boundary is zero .",
    "energy and density evolution reveal the different stages of the bubble .",
    "figure  [ energy](_top _ ) presents the time evolution of various energies at the early stage , in which the gravitational energy @xmath41 and the internal energy @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the infinitesimal volume and the integral is over the entire computation domain , have been reduced by their initial values @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the total energy is defined as @xmath46 , where the kinetic energy is defined as @xmath47 and the magnetic energy is defined as @xmath48 . at the early stage ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the kinetic energy increases since the bubble accelerates upward due to buoyancy , and the magnetic energy decreases due to work done in expansion from the weak initial lorentz force and conversion to shock and wave energy @xcite .",
    "the gravitational energy increases because there is a net outward mass flow in the axial direction . the passage of the shock wave heats and compresses the icm and alters its pressure gradient .",
    "the total energy @xmath50 is almost constant before @xmath51 , at which time the shock and wavefront reach the boundary .",
    "conservation of the total energy for @xmath52 is not strictly satisfied due to numerical diffusion .",
    "the initial bubble expansion ( @xmath53 ) is approximately adiabatic , which gives @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the bubble volume .",
    "therefore @xmath56 , where the subscript @xmath57 and @xmath58 indicate the initial and final state , respectively . at @xmath59 ,",
    "the radius of the bubble has increased from @xmath58 to @xmath60 , which gives @xmath61 , roughly matching the amount of magnetic energy in the bubble [ @xmath62 from fig .",
    "[ energy](_top _ ) ] . for later times",
    "[ energy](_bottom _ ) ] , fitting with @xmath63 , we have : ( 1 )  a fast dissipation stage ( @xmath52 ) when magnetic energy dissipation time @xmath64 ; ( 2 )  a slow dissipation stage ( @xmath65 ) when @xmath66 .",
    "both times are much smaller than the numerical dissipation time @xmath67 at the corresponding stages ( see discussions at the end of this section ) .",
    "the kinetic energy is oscillating while it is decaying slowly , which can be understood as follows .",
    "gravity pulls the bubble down to the denser icm , compressing the bubble and causing an increase in magnetic energy ( since the magnetic flux is nearly conserved ) .",
    "this results in the magnetic energy oscillating in phase with the kinetic energy with period @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) . at @xmath70 after several periods of decaying oscillations , about 3.5% of the initial magnetic energy remains .",
    "the magnetic field suppresses instabilities and therefore the bubble remains intact longer .",
    "figure  [ overview ] presents the typical density distribution ( logarithmic scale ) in 2d @xmath71@xmath72 slices at @xmath73 at different times ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the white solid contour lines indicate contours of constant magnetic field strength @xmath75 .",
    "consistent with fig .",
    "[ energy](_bottom _ ) , after @xmath76 , the bubble undergoes a slowly decaying oscillation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we have also performed simulations of an unmagnetized bubble and found that it disintegrates after @xmath59 , whereas the magnetic bubble still clearly differentiates itself from the ambient medium at @xmath70 ( fig .  [ overview ] ) .",
    "the formation of an  umbrella \" or a thin protective magnetic layer on the bubble working surface suppresses instabilities @xcite .",
    "the stronger magnetic field is also found to move the bubble faster and push the bubble farther away from its initial position .",
    "the position of the bubble top as a function of time is shown in fig .",
    "this position is calculated by plotting the axial profile of the density along the line of @xmath79 and finding the location of the first density jump from the top of the domain .",
    "comparing the unmagnetized run ( dash line ) with the magnetized run ( both without initial momentum / rotation ) , we can see that the rising speed increases from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "note that the rough estimate of the terminal speed @xmath82 based on the initial gravitational acceleration @xmath83 and size @xmath84 , both position - dependent , is @xmath85 , assuming force balance between buoyancy and viscous drag force at the final stage @xcite .",
    "we investigate the effect of the magnetic field on bubble stability in more detail .",
    "following @xcite , we first study khi of the bubble . at both sides of the bubble ,",
    "the magnetic field is almost uniform , not twisted like at the top of the bubble . from linear analysis , the instability criterion for nonaxisymmetric khi surface modes is @xcite : @xmath86^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath87 is the velocity shear and @xmath88 is the surface alfvn speed .",
    "the subscripts @xmath89 and @xmath90 indicate the bubble and external medium , respectively .",
    "the nonaxisymmetric body modes would be important if @xcite : ( 1 ) @xmath91 , in which @xmath92 is the fast magnetosonic speed ; or ( 2 ) @xmath93 , in which @xmath94 is the alfvn speed and @xmath95 is the slow magnetosonic speed .",
    "the definitions of @xmath96 are : @xmath97^{1/2}\\}\\big\\}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "since we focus on the @xmath71-direction only , @xmath98 are taken to be @xmath99 .",
    "figure  [ khi ] ( _ top _ ) displays the transverse distribution of the bulk flow speed @xmath100 , the density @xmath101 , and the magnetic field strength @xmath102 at @xmath103 at @xmath104 .",
    "a distinct velocity shear is identified at @xmath105 . across this shear , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the inequality @xmath108 holds .",
    "this means that the khi surface modes are completely suppressed .",
    "figure  [ khi ] ( _ bottom _ ) displays the transverse distribution of @xmath55 , @xmath92 , and @xmath95 at @xmath103 at @xmath104 .",
    "we see that the bulk flow @xmath55 lies between @xmath92 and @xmath95 .",
    "the inequality @xmath109 is satisfied in the body of the buoyant bubble .",
    "this rules out the khi body modes as well .",
    "rti could also be suppressed by the magnetic field . for the idealized case of two conducting fluids separated by a contact discontinuity with a uniform magnetic field parallel to the interface undergoing constant acceleration @xmath83",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that rti on a scale @xmath110 parallel to the field requires @xmath111^{1/2}$ ] , in which @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the densities in the heavy and light fluids respectively .",
    "modes perpendicular to the field are unaffected . at the top of the bubble ( @xmath114 ) ( fig .",
    "[ rti ] ) , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are found to be @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively , and the gravitational acceleration @xmath83 is calculated to be @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath110 is chosen to be the computation domain size , the maximum possible mode wavelength in the simulations , then the critical magnetic field strength is @xmath118 , which is larger than the magnetic field ( @xmath119 ) at that location .",
    "this means that only part of the parallel modes are suppressed regardless of the perpendicular modes .",
    "this is not consistent with the simulation results .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the twisting nature of the bubble field at the top of the bubble introduces a current sheet at the surface , and the changes in the direction of the field at the interface must be on very small scales to inhibit the interchange modes .",
    "a more detailed study of this effect is beyond the scope of this paper and will be the subject of future study .",
    "our simulation also provides one possible explanation of the morphology and origin of the large scale magnetic field and the generation of  ghost cavities \" observed in many clusters .",
    "like @xcite , a magnetized high - density tail remains as the bubble rises ( fig .",
    "[ overview ] ) .",
    "the tails have an elongated morphology ( fig .  [ overview ] ) , resembling h@xmath30 filaments , which is found to indicate the history of the rising bubble .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic field also helps stabilize this  filament \" as it is still visible at @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite has argued that thermal conduction has to be strongly suppressed in the icm ; otherwise , such cold filaments would be rapidly evaporated .",
    "as in @xcite , our results provide a possibility that thermal conduction may be locally weaker in the bubble wake , thus preventing or slowing down filament evaporation .",
    "the magnetic field is distributed between @xmath120 and @xmath121 at @xmath70 with peak value around @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) or mean value around @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , close to the estimates of wider cluster fields @xcite .",
    "this large - scale ( @xmath126 ) magnetic field structure also mimics the morphology of the second class (  phoenix \" ) of  radio relics \" elongated from the cluster center to the periphery observed in a 115 @xcite .",
    "the simulation results mean that the magnetic bubble rising from @xmath127 with an initial magnetic energy of @xmath128 , will spread magnetic fields between @xmath129 and keep a magnetized bubble between @xmath130 and @xmath131 for at least @xmath132 . therefore one could reproduce the intact but detached  ghost cavity \" observed in some systems such as perseus - a .",
    "real radio lobes possess complex , jet - driven flows , different from the static bubble that we use for our initial conditions .",
    "we study the effects of additional variations in the initial bubble by having : ( 1 )  an initial uniform injection speed @xmath133 or ( 2 )  an initial uniform rotation @xmath134 .",
    "@xcite reported that the radio lobe gains a momentum of @xmath135 , and the rotation speed @xmath134 at the edge of the bubble reaches @xmath136 after jet - driven inflation and interaction with the ambient icm , although neither are not uniform inside the bubble . here",
    "we take these two values as our initial values for @xmath133 and @xmath134 and idealize both to be uniform throughout the bubble .",
    "[ pos ] presents the time evolution of the position of the bubble top with initial uniform injection velocity @xmath137 ( long dash ) and initial uniform rotation speed @xmath138 ( dash dot ) .",
    "it is seen that these two variables only have some influence on the evolution of the bubble during the early stage .",
    "the bubble with an initial rotation has a reduced buoyancy resulting from rotation - driven instabilities that in turn lead to a reduced pressure differential between the bubble and the icm .",
    "the evolution , and structure of the bubble in the later times are , however , essentially the same .",
    "the effects of numerical diffusion are estimated as follows .",
    "if we fit the net toroidal magnetic flux @xmath139 ( only positive @xmath140 is selected ) as @xmath141 , the  resistive \" dissipation time due to numerical diffusion is @xmath142 for @xmath143 , @xmath144 for @xmath145 , and @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "therefore the numerical diffusion is not important on the time scales of interest @xmath148 .",
    "increasing numerical resolution can further reduce the numerical diffusion .",
    "the oldest bubbles known so far are a few hundred @xmath149 old @xcite , which are much younger than the long - sustained ( @xmath150 a hubble time ) magnetized bubbles reported in this _ letter_.",
    "the simulations show that at later times @xmath76 , the density and x - ray luminosity contrast between the bubble and icm plasma at the periphery of the cluster is small , which makes the direct x - ray observation of the bubble faraway from the parent galaxy very difficult .",
    "but the radio bubble at the borders of the clusters may still be detectable through : ( 1 ) faraday rotation measurement of the outskirts of the cluster if an outside synchrotron source exists ; ( 2 ) or radio observation from re - energization of fossil radio bubble plasma by shocks or mergers .",
    "it is highly possible for the bubbles to pile up in the outer atmospheres of the clusters in deep chandra observation , if those observations are technically viable .",
    "it is conceivable that part of the initial magnetic energy of the bubble accelerates cosmic rays . throughout the lifetime of a cluster",
    ", there could be multiple agns injecting jets / lobes into the icm .",
    "both the cosmic rays and the remaining magnetic fields ( distributed over large scales ) could provide the energy sources for phenomena such as radio relics and radio haloes that have been observed for a number of clusters @xcite ."
