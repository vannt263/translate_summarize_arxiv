    "scaling properties of the local surface roughness @xmath0 and of the height - height correlation function ( hhcf ) @xmath4 are very useful to understand the growth dynamics of thin films and other deposits @xcite .",
    "the usual approach is to measure exponents from plots of @xmath0 or @xmath4 as a function of the box size @xmath12 ( roughness exponent ) or time @xmath13 ( growth exponent ) and to relate their values to some universality class of growth @xcite .",
    "however , a very small number of systems exibit simple scaling features to match those theories . for instance",
    ", the presence of grains in the film surface leads to a crossover between two regimes where @xmath0 increases with @xmath12 with different roughness exponents , @xmath5 and @xmath3 , as illustrated in fig . 1 @xcite . for the hhcf ,",
    "the same crossover occurs with exponents @xmath11 and @xmath14 .. similar crossover is observed in other systems , such as fresh snow on the ground and pyroclastic deposits on volcanic surfaces @xcite .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", the crossover with @xmath2 was shown to be a geometric effect of the grainy surface structure and of the gliding box method ( analogous result is obtained with the box counting method ) .",
    "it was also shown that the crossover took place when @xmath12 was close to the average grain size .",
    "if the grain surface is flat , @xmath5 is very close to @xmath15 , while for rounded grains it decreases to values close to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these results match those of a large number of experimental works @xcite .",
    "however , other experimental works show film surfaces with grainy structure , the same crossover in roughness scaling or hhcf , but with much smaller exponents @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the usual interpretation for those exponents is that small scale surface features are determined by a different growth dynamics . indeed ,",
    "even the crossover with @xmath2 was already interpreted as an anomalous scaling , with @xmath5 being called local roughness exponent ( denoted @xmath16 ) and @xmath3 called global roughness exponent . for these reasons , in many systems it is still unclear whether a crossover similar to that in fig .",
    "1 should be interpreted as a purely geometric effect or as a consequence of a competitive growth dynamics .        here",
    "we study several growth models with grainy surface features to show the possible effects of the grain shape , of the method of calculation of averages of squared quantities , of the working quantity ( @xmath0 or @xmath4 ) and of the universality class of the growth process .",
    "for all growth models , grain shapes , and methods of analysis , we observe crossovers at box sizes very close to the average grain size .",
    "we also show that a very broad range of @xmath5 can be found , depending on the grain shape and the working quantity , but independently of the universality class of growth , which determines only the value of @xmath3 .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained for the exponents @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "the comparison with experimental works with several materials and deposition methods gives additional support to the geometric interpretation of the crossover in those systems .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we define average quantities and present the growth models . in sec .",
    "[ theoretical ] , we recall the results of some exactly solvable models with grains at the surface , which explain the crossover with @xmath2 and @xmath8 ( with the usual definition of the hhcf ) . in sec .",
    "[ shape ] we analyze the effects of the grain shape , particularly some very sharp grains , considering models in different universality classes . in sec .",
    "[ experimental ] , we show the applications of our approach to real films . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] , we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "first we define the average quantities analyzed in this work .    the surface roughness in square boxes of size @xmath12 at time @xmath13 is usually defined as @xmath17 the overbars in eq .",
    "( [ defw ] ) denote averages of the height @xmath18 inside a given box position ( spatial average ) and the angular brackets represent the configurational average as the box scans the whole surface of a deposit .",
    "this is called gliding box method , in which the scanning box moves one pixel each time it performs a new spatial average . in box counting methods",
    ", the surface is divided in nonintersecting boxes for the configurational average .",
    "alternatively , some authors define the roughness as @xmath19 i. e. they calculate the configurational average of the square height fluctuation and take the square root of that average .",
    "when several images of a deposit are available , or several configurations are grown with the same model , these different samples also contribute to the above configurational averages .    for window sizes below the grain size ,",
    "the roughness scales as @xmath20 which defines the initial roughness exponent @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "the height - height correlation function ( hhcf ) at distance @xmath12 and time @xmath13 is usually defined as @xmath21 } ^2\\rangle}^{1/2 } , \\label{defcorr}\\ ] ] with configurational averages taken over all different initial positions @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively , it can be defined as @xmath23 which corresponds to an interchange of the configurational average and the calculation of the square root in eq .",
    "( [ defcorr ] ) . in this sense , the calculation of @xmath24 parallels that of @xmath25 , while the calculation of @xmath26 parallels that of @xmath0 .    for window sizes below the grain size ,",
    "the hhcf scales as @xmath27 which defines the initial roughness exponent @xmath11 for that function .    for window sizes much larger than the grain size ( i. e. @xmath28 - see fig .",
    "1 ) , a surface obeying normal scaling has @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath31 obey the same scaling .",
    "those exponents are representative of the large lengthscale kinetics governing the growth process .",
    "typical examples of growth kinetics are those of edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite , of kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite , and the diffusion - dominated ones , linear ( mullins - herring - mh ) @xcite or nonlinear ( villain - lai - das sarma - vlds ) @xcite .",
    "now we present the models for growth of thin films with grains at the surface .",
    "intrinsic corrections to scaling for large @xmath12 and large @xmath13 should be avoided in those models , so that any crossover is solely due to the grainy structure .",
    "this request excludes the grain deposition models introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and related ballistic - like models @xcite because they have remarkable scaling corrections . on the other hand , some models with smooth surfaces and particle enlargement presented in refs .",
    "@xcite satisfy that condition .",
    "they are described below .",
    "the first model has kpz kinetics .",
    "the first step is to grow a deposit with cubic particles of unit size following the rules of the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model : the aggregation of the incident particle is accepted only if the height differences of nearest neighbors are always @xmath32 or @xmath15 ( otherwise the aggregation attempt is rejected ) @xcite .",
    "we recall that @xmath33 for the kpz class in two - dimensional substrates @xcite .",
    "the second model has vlds kinetics .",
    "the initial deposit is grown with the rules of the conserved rsos model , where the incident particle executes a random walk between neighboring columns until finding a column where it can aggregate respecting the conditions on height differences @xcite .",
    "we recall that @xmath34 for the vlds class in two - dimensional substrates @xcite .",
    "after growing the initial deposit , with kpz or vlds model , the size of each particle is enlarged by a factor @xmath35 , i. e. each particle is transformed in a cubic grain of side @xmath35 .",
    "most of our simulations are performed with @xmath36 .",
    "the final step is replacing the top cub grains ( surface grains ) by rounded or sharp structures .",
    "three shapes are used : semi - ellipsoids of horizontal radius @xmath37 and vertical radius @xmath18 , cones with that radius and height @xmath18 , and pyramids of square basis of side @xmath35 and height @xmath18 .",
    "they are illustrated in fig .",
    "several values of @xmath18 are considered for each shape , typically between @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "that fit the shape of the cubic grain at their bottom .",
    "this is the reason for radius @xmath37 of their basis.,width=340 ]    in the scaling of @xmath0 or @xmath4 , the role of the height @xmath18 is measured relatively to the height of the surface steps , which is @xmath35 .",
    "the horizontal scaling factor is also @xmath35 for the cubic grains , but this is not important for the scaling exponents .",
    "for instance , if the grains were constructed with the shape of paralelepids of height @xmath35 and horizontal sides @xmath39 , the scaling exponents would not change .",
    "thus , the aspect ratio of the grains considered here is not a limitation of the model .",
    "the simulations of the kpz and vlds models were performed in square substrates ( three - dimensional deposits ) of lateral size @xmath40 at times of order @xmath41 . for the rsos model",
    ", it corresponds to approximately @xmath42 layers of unit size particles ; for the crsos model , corresponds to @xmath41 layers .",
    "after replacement of the original particles by grains of size @xmath36 , the deposits have lateral size @xmath43 .",
    "simulations in smaller sizes ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the original models ) and different grain size ( @xmath46 ) give similar results for all exponents , indicating that finite - size and finite - time effects are negligible .",
    "as the scanning box glides along the surface , it frequently encloses high surface steps created between neighboring grains .",
    "these are the box positions where the largest height fluctuations are encountered , thus they give the main contribution to the roughness ( eqs .",
    "[ defw ] or [ defw1 ] ) .",
    "if the box has size @xmath12 ( i. e. @xmath12 pixels in each direction ) , then the number of box positions that involve each high step is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the configurational average of eq .",
    "( [ defw ] ) gives roughness @xmath0 proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "this gives @xmath47 , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite and confirmed by simulations of several models .    when eq .",
    "( [ defw1 ] ) is used , @xmath48 is a configurational average .",
    "the main contribution to that average also comes from box positions enclosing high surface steps , thus , that average is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "this gives @xmath25 proportional to @xmath49 , i. e. , @xmath50 .",
    "these results are confirmed by our simulations of the rsos model with cubic grains , as shown in fig .",
    "it clearly shows the remarkable difference in the scaling of @xmath0 and @xmath25 for box sizes smaller than the grain size , while the same exponent @xmath3 after the crossover represents the universality class of the process .     of data for the kpz model with cubic grains :",
    "a ) @xmath0 ( blue squares ) and @xmath25 ( red triangles ) ; and b ) @xmath31 ( blue squares ) and @xmath4 ( red triangles).,width=264 ]    similar situation is observed with the hhcf .",
    "again the main contribution for the configurational average comes from box positions which involve high surface steps , thus this average is proportional to @xmath12 . with the most used definition of that function ( eq . [ defcorr ] ) , we have @xmath24 proportional to @xmath49 , thus the crossover takes place with @xmath51 . instead",
    ", if the scaling of @xmath26 is analyzed , we expect @xmath52 .",
    "simulations of the rsos model with cubic grains show the predicted crossover , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the exponent @xmath11 is very close to @xmath53 for @xmath24 and slightly below @xmath15 for @xmath26 .",
    "again , the universal exponent @xmath14 is obtained after the crossover ; as expected , @xmath54 .    with the usual definitions of surface roughness ( @xmath0 - eq .",
    "[ defw ] ) and hhcf ( @xmath4 - eq .",
    "[ defcorr ] ) , the roughness exponents measured before the crossover ( @xmath5 , @xmath11 ) are different .",
    "this contrasts with the expected universality after the crossover ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "our analysis show that those discrepancies are effects of the grainy morphology and the calculation method , in particular the order of calculation of square root and configurational average in eqs .",
    "( [ defw ] ) and ( [ defcorr ] ) .",
    "rounding of the surface grains may lead to @xmath5 between @xmath7 and @xmath15 , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the replacement of the cubic grains by the rounded or sharp structures in fig .",
    "2 , with @xmath55 , leads to much more drastic changes in the initial exponents of @xmath56 and @xmath24 .",
    "this result is illustrated in figs . 4a and 4b for films grown with the kpz model and pyramidal grains of height @xmath57 : @xmath5 decreases to @xmath6 and @xmath11 increases to @xmath58 ( while @xmath59 ) .",
    "4b also shows the formation of a plateau in the hhcf before the second scaling regime , which is characteristic of all sharp grains with large heights .    ) and b ) hhcf ( @xmath4 ) as a function of the window size @xmath12 , for the kpz model with pyramidal grains of heigth @xmath57.,width=264 ]    in table i , we show the values of @xmath5 and @xmath11 obtained for semi - elliptical , conical and pyramidal grains with several heights .",
    "a remarkable result is that films grown with the vlds model have the same exponents @xmath5 , @xmath11 up to the second decimal place , despite the significant change in the asymptotic roughness exponent ( @xmath60 ) . in figs . 5a and 5b , we show results for conic grains with height @xmath61 , which give @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "those values are close to the kpz values shown in table i for the same grains .",
    "the main differences from the models with kpz scaling are that the change in the slope of the roughness plot is smaller and there is a slope increase in the hhcf plot when passing from the first to the second scaling regime .    ) and",
    "b ) hhcf ( @xmath4 ) as a function of the window size @xmath12 , for the vlds model with conical grains of heigth @xmath61.,width=264 ]    table i shows that @xmath5 is much smaller than the limit @xmath7 obtained in previous work @xcite for many grain shapes , particularly for sharp conic and pyramidal grains . with the structures studied here ,",
    "the lower limit is close to @xmath6 , obtained with pyramidal grains . for @xmath64 ,",
    "the general trend is that the increase of @xmath18 leads to decrease of @xmath5 . for larger",
    "@xmath18 ( not shown in table i ) , a very slow increase of @xmath5 towards @xmath15 is observed .",

    "@xmath65 of the grains are flat and @xmath66 have pyramidal shape , with equally distributed heights @xmath61 , @xmath57 , and @xmath67 . for that surface , we obtain @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which is close to the average of the results in table i for those shapes .",
    "in the experimental works discussed below , the exponent @xmath5 defined here is frequently named local roughness exponent @xmath16 , as a reference to the small lengthscale behavior and/or to a possible anomalous scaling .",
    "several experimental works have already shown the crossover of fig . 1 with @xmath70 , which is explained by the growth models with flat or slightly rounded grains @xcite .",
    "among those works , we highlight the study of rf sputtered @xmath71 films by kleinke et al @xcite , which gives @xmath72 ; the spray pyrolysis growth of @xmath73 films by eboth et al @xcite , which gives @xmath74 for high flow rates ; the electrodeposition of cooper by mendez et al @xcite and of gold by vzquez et al @xcite , which give @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively ; the electrochemical roughening of silver electrodes by otsuka and iwasaki @xcite , which gives @xmath5 between @xmath77 and @xmath78 ; and the pulsed laser deposition of @xmath79 modied-@xmath80 films of vasco et al @xcite , which have @xmath81 .",
    "however , many works show the same crossover with exponents @xmath5 between @xmath82 and @xmath7 , and surface images confirm the presence of grains of approximately conic or pyramidal shape , much higher than the steps between neighboring grains .",
    "these features are observed in films of various materials and substrates , deposited with different techniques .",
    "this justifies our approach with geometrical models , independently of the particular growth dynamics .    among the applications to inorganic materials",

    "this is consistent with our models of semi - elliptical grains of lower @xmath18 , and the images actually show a smooth grain morphology .    the same features are also observed in organic materials",
    ". films formed with bilayers of poly(allylamine hydrochloride ) and a side - chain - substituted azobenzene copolymer ( ma - co - dr13 ) , after deposition of @xmath89 or @xmath90 bilayers , show grains with a broad size distribution , and the initial roughness exponents @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "afm images of chemically deposited polyaniline thin films on glass substrates @xcite have similar features , but , as far as we know , roughness scaling was not studied with those images .",
    "the surface of langmuir  blodgett films of polyaniline and a neutral biphosphinic ruthenium complex ( rupy ) of ref .",
    "@xcite also show those grainy features with some high peaks , and initial roughness exponents are in the range @xmath93 for thicknesses between @xmath15 and @xmath94 layers . however , most estimates of @xmath5 are between @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xcite , in good agreement with our results for pyramidal grains .",
    "it is interesting to observe that some surface images shown in refs . @xcite",
    "have features similar to the model illustration in fig .",

    "it is also important to recall that there are systems with crossover in the roughness scaling which do not show the sharp grainy features of our models , and consequently deserve separate investigation .",

    "@xcite ( @xmath104 ) , which also would deserve a separate investigation ( those films have @xmath105 , which also can not be easily explained with the well known kinetic growth theories @xcite ) .",
    "the crossover in hhcf scaling obtained in some systems can also be related to our models .",
    "for instance , manes et al @xcite used hhcf as a measure of fresh snow roughness and obtained @xmath11 between @xmath106 and @xmath107 in a set of five experiments .",
    "these values are consistent with our model with very high semi - ellipsoidal grains ( @xmath108 ) or with conic or pyramidal grains with @xmath109 or less .",

    "results of the recent work on pentacene island growth on stepped oxide surfaces @xcite can also be related to our models .",
    "first , for long lengths , the hhcf has exponent @xmath111 , which is expected for height fluctuations dominated by the surface steps ; indeed , arguments analogous to those for flat grains ( sec . [ theoretical ] ) give @xmath112 .",
    "however , for small lengths , height fluctuations in the surface terraces ( due to pentacene islands ) lead to the increase of the hhcf exponent to the range @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "recent works showing evidence of anomalous scaling in organic and inorganic film surfaces also give estimates of hhcf exponents above @xmath53 at short lengthscales @xcite .",
    "although both short and long range dynamics may be much more complex than in our models , a simple geometric interpretation of the short range exponents may also be considered due to the presence of grainy structures in the surface images .",
    "we extended the work on growth models with grainy surfaces to analyze the effects of the grain shape , of the method of calculation of averages of squared quantities , of the working quantity ( roughness or hhcf ) and of the universality class of the growth process .",
    "for all models , grain shapes , and methods of analysis , we observe crossovers at box sizes very close to the average grain size .",

    "simulations of kpz and vlds models show that the universality class has no significant effect on the estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
