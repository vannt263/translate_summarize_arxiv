    "the born - infeld ( bi ) electromagnetic theory @xcite was originally proposed as a nonlinear correction of the maxwell theory in order to overcome the problem of infinities in the classical electrodynamics of point particles .",
    "the underlying idea was to simply modify the classical theory not to have physical quantities of infinities , that is the principle of finiteness .",
    "it was to replace the original lagrangian density for the maxwell electrodynamics with a square root form with a parameter @xmath0 , by which the finiteness of electric fields is ensured .",
    "this was the same with the way the special relativity has taken into account the finiteness of the speed of light @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 replaced @xmath3 .",
    "the exact form of the bi lagrangian density appears in the next section .",
    "this theory in recent years again has received much attention since the string theory found its relevance to the bi theory @xcite : the dynamics of electromagnetic fields on d - branes is described by the bi theory , and finiteness of electric fields is naturally observed .",
    "be that as it may , this paper is not going to the string theory , but the bi theory will be considered rather as a nonlinear version of the maxwell theory as it was the original standpoint of born and infeld .",
    "hence , it makes sense to choose the vlasov equation as a matter model since this equation describes the dynamics of classical particles .    in the present paper",
    ", we study the bi equations coupled with the vlasov equation as a matter model , and this induces inhomogeneities to the bi equations . for homogeneous cases",
    ", we can find several results on the cauchy problem . in @xcite , chae and",
    "huh proved the existence of global classical solutions for small initial data .",
    "they considered the bi equations as quasilinear wave equations and crucially used the null form structure of the nonlinear terms . on the other hand , brenier",
    "@xcite considered the bi equations as a system of hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "he supplemented additional conservation laws to obtain an augmented bi system and discussed conditions for existence of global solutions in one dimensional case .",
    "the similar frameworks can be found in @xcite , and for different approaches we refer to @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the bi equations will be considered as a system of hyperbolic equations as in @xcite , but it differs in that inhomogeneous terms are taken into account .    on the other hand ,",
    "the vlasov equation has been widely used to describe matters in connection with other field equations : electrostatic or electromagnetic fields , non - relativistic or fully relativistic gravitational fields , and so on . for detailed discussions on the vlasov - type equations , we refer to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the analysis of the vlasov - maxwell system is applied to our case , and as a simple but nontrivial case we consider the `` one and one - half dimensional '' case as in @xcite .",
    "the vlasov equation in this dimensional case is introduced in section 2 .",
    "before we proceed , we briefly discuss some points of this paper .    \\1 . to make a coupled system of the bi and the vlasov equations",
    ", we should determine an analogous equation corresponding to the lorentz equation in the maxwell case .",
    "in other words , we have to derive an equation of motions of particles interacting with the bi electromagnetic field .",
    "however , as it was pointed out in @xcite , it is impossible to derive separate equations for the charged particles due to the nonlinearity of the field",
    ". instead , we use the `` generalized lorentz force '' , which is available for small and almost constant fields @xcite , and this will be discussed in section 2 .    \\2 .",
    "as we mentioned above , the bi equations will be considered as a system of hyperbolic equations . to better understand its hyperbolic structure ,",
    "we introduce a transformation in section 3 .",
    "this transformation is quite tricky but simple . by this transformation , the linear degeneracy of the bi system",
    "is then easily seen , and moreover it makes the system easy to handle , for instance the proof of lemma 5.6 would be much more complicated without the transformation .",
    "the main difference from the maxwell case is that we have to control the characteristics of the field equations as well as of the vlasov equation .",
    "in glassey - strauss result @xcite , spatial and temporal derivatives were split into linear combinations of the maxwell and the vlasov characteristics called @xmath4 and @xmath5 derivatives respectively .",
    "this was possible because the maxwell field always propagates with the speed of light , while the vlasov particles do not move with the speed of light .",
    "however , it will be shown in section 3 that the bi field propagates with speed @xmath6 or @xmath7 , which may have values less than the speed of light @xmath8 .",
    "hence , we should make a suitable assumption on initial data in order to apply the argument of @xcite , and this will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "in contrast to glassey - schaeffer s result @xcite , we obtain a local - in - time result . in that paper , the maxwell electromagnetic field",
    "is estimated as @xmath9 , ( see lemma 1 and corollary 1 in @xcite ) , and this estimate implies that any particles considered have momentum @xmath10 with growth order @xmath11 .",
    "however , this is not enough to be applied to our case .",
    "if a momentum grows , and consequently tends to infinity , then its corresponding velocity will tend to the speed of light , and finally a resonance between the particle velocity and the bi field propagation may appear in a finite time .",
    "this will be discussed in section 5.2 .",
    "it seems that more qualitative analysis for the bi and the vlasov characteristics is required to obtain a global - in - time result .",
    "* notations . *",
    "we collect some notations which are used in this paper .",
    "* the speed of light @xmath1 , and mass @xmath12 and charge @xmath13 of each particle are assumed to be unity : @xmath14 * greek indices run from @xmath15 to @xmath16 and latin indices from @xmath17 to @xmath16 .",
    "the indices are raised or lowered by multiplication with the minkowski metric @xmath18 , and we use the einstein summation convention such as @xmath19 this notation will appear only in section 2.1 . * for a scalar or vector valued function @xmath20 , @xmath21 , we define @xmath22 then for a momentum @xmath23 , its corresponding velocity is defined by @xmath24 . * the usual @xmath25 norms , @xmath26 , are used . for a function @xmath27 defined on @xmath28 its norms are defined as follows : for @xmath29 and each @xmath30 , @xmath31 and similarly for @xmath32 and each @xmath30 , @xmath33 and so on .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first set up the cauchy problem for the coupled system in section 2 , where the born - infeld equations will be properly coupled to the vlasov equation in the one and one - half dimensional case . in section 3 , we introduce a transformation which transforms the born - infeld equations into a quasilinear system in a diagonal form . in section 4 ,",
    "we state the main result of the present paper .",
    "suitable assumptions will be made on initial data in this section .",
    "section 5 and 6 are devoted to the proof of the main theorem .",
    "in this section , we study the born - infeld equations and the vlasov equation to consider their coupled system in a low dimensional case which is called the one and one - half dimensions . in the first part we briefly review the born - infeld electromagnetic theory , and then in the second part we consider the one and one - half dimensional case for the coupled system .",
    "one can obtain field equations by constructing a suitable lagrangian density @xmath34 and then applying the euler - lagrange equations to it . in the case that charged particles are given as source",
    ", the interaction between the particles and field must be considered in the construction of a lagrangian density . in this paper , we simply construct a lagrangian density by adding the standard interaction term @xmath35 to the lagrangian as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath34 is the lagrangian density for the field itself , and @xmath37 is a four - potential from which the electromagnetic field tensor is defined by @xmath38 . in the born - infeld theory ,",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath34 is defined as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath18 is the minkowski metric , and @xmath40 is a parameter which measures the nonlinearity of the field . for simplicity",
    ", we take @xmath41 in the present paper . the euler - lagrange equations",
    "now give the equations of field : @xmath42 to have explicit formulae for the field , instead of the tensor form , we use @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 in place of @xmath47 and @xmath48 as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the completely antisymmetric tensor such that @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and so on . then , we get the following system of pdes : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the charge density and the current density respectively .",
    "note that we obtain maxwell s equations by setting @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the main difference from the maxwell theory is the following nonlinear constitutive relations between @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 : @xmath58 in the above relations , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given as functions of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , we convert them into a more convenient form for later use , that is , we rewrite @xmath43 and @xmath46 as functions of @xmath45 and @xmath44 as follows : @xmath59 which can be verified by direct calculations ( see chapter 20 of @xcite ) . as a result , we obtain the field equations  for given charge and current density .",
    "we have now obtained the equations of field for given sources @xmath60 and @xmath61 . on the other hand , in order to make a self - consistent coupled system , we have to find the equations of motions of particles for given fields @xmath45 and @xmath44 . in the linear electromagnetic theory , it is well - known that particle trajectories are determined by the lorentz equation .",
    "let @xmath62 be a momentum of a particle with charge @xmath13 and @xmath10 the corresponding velocity .",
    "then , the lorentz force exerted on the particle is given as follows : @xmath63 however , it is not easy to derive explicit equations of motions of particles when they are interacting with the born - infeld electromagnetic field due to the nonlinearity .",
    "we refer to @xcite for alternative methods . in the case that a small electromagnetic field is considered , we can use the `` generalized lorentz force '' as in @xcite , where the author studied the dynamics of a particle `` dyon '' interacting with the born - infeld field .",
    "dyon is a hypothetical particle which has both electric and magnetic charges .",
    "let @xmath64 be electric charge and @xmath65 magnetic charge of a particle .",
    "then we have the following generalized lorentz force : @xmath66 in the present paper , we will not consider the particles having magnetic charges , hence we take the equation of motions of particles as the following equation : @xmath67      we now set up the problem for the one and one - half dimensional case by following the framework of @xcite , where the authors studied the vlasov - maxwell system .",
    "in this case , the spatial variable is @xmath68 and the momentum variables are @xmath69 .",
    "hence , the electric field @xmath45 and the magnetic field @xmath44 are given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , for a suitable time interval @xmath73 , and the charge density @xmath74 and the current density @xmath75 are given by @xmath76 then , the field equations are reduced to @xmath77 and we note that @xmath78 is obtained from the first and the third equations : @xmath79 these are consistent with each other because the densities @xmath60 and @xmath61 will be induced by the vlasov equation , from which the continuity equation `` @xmath80 '' is naturally obtained , which makes the consistency between them .",
    "we will use the latter formula to define @xmath78 , and now we have only two equations of fields .",
    "the constitutive relations  are reduced to @xmath81 we now consider the vlasov equation .",
    "in contrast with @xcite , where the lorentz force was used , we take the generalized lorentz force to have the following equation : @xmath82 where @xmath10 denotes the momentum of a particle , and @xmath24 is the corresponding velocity : @xmath83 . the charge density @xmath60 and the current density @xmath61",

    "let @xmath98 and @xmath99 be @xmath100-solutions to the hyperbolic system  for given @xmath100-functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath78 defined by . then , the hyperbolic system is rewritten as the following quasilinear form : @xmath101 where the components of @xmath102 are given by @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath72 , are given by @xmath105    the proof is an elementary calculation , so we only remark the fact that @xmath106-derivatives of @xmath78 have been replaced by @xmath60 .",
    "hence , we obtain a quasilinear form with respect to @xmath97 and @xmath44 for given @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we next compute the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath107 .",
    "consider the matrix @xmath107 in : @xmath108 then , its left eigenvectors can be chosen by @xmath109 and the corresponding eigenvalues are given by @xmath110    this lemma is proved by direct calculations , so we skip the proof .",
    "if the fields @xmath45 and @xmath44 do not blow up at finite time , then the eigenvectors @xmath111 and @xmath112 are linearly independent , and @xmath113 is always strictly greater than @xmath114 .",
