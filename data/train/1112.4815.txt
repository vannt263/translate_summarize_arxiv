    "hd  23514 ( hii  1132 ) is an f6 star in the pleiades .",
    "it is one of only a handful of youthful stars , ages 35 to @xmath2100 myr , that are surrounded by warm dust particles located in the terrestrial planet zone and which absorb a percent or so of the bolometric luminosity of their central star @xcite .",
    "we have observed hd  23514 with an adaptive optics system at the keck observatory using the nirc2 camera to check the binarity of this unusually dusty star .    to the best of our knowledge , to date",
    "no substellar companion to a stellar primary has been found in the pleiades .",
    "however , while this paper was being reviewed , @xcite announced the discovery of a substellar companion to the pleiad hii  1348 .",
    "studies of substellar objects in the pleiades focus on free floating brown dwarfs or companions to low mass stars @xcite . with an adaptive optics survey of 144 solar type stars in the pleiades , @xcite was sensitive to objects with masses down to @xmath20.03  m@xmath1 at separations of @xmath21 . however , their lowest mass companion ( @xmath20.15  m@xmath1 ) is still above the substellar boundary ( they did not observe hd  23514 ) .",
    "our work has revealed one such substellar companion in the pleiades .",
    "we observed hd  23514 with the adaptive optics ( ao ) system and the nirc2 narrow camera at the 10-m keck telescope at mauna kea observatory .",
    "observations were performed in natural guide star mode .",
    "some images were obtained in angular differential imaging mode ( adi ) while others had the primary behind a 600  mas or 800  mas diameter coronographic spot .",
    "the rest of the images were taken with dithered observations in position angle ( pa ) mode where the field of view is rotated so as to keep the sky fixed on the nirc2 camera .",
    "all data were reduced in the standard manner ( flat fielding , dark subtraction , sky subtraction ) with iraf routines .",
    "the data was linearized prior to processing using an idl program .",
    "we have applied the nirc2 distortion solution presented in @xcite to refine our astrometry .",
    "we adopt a pixel scale of @xmath3 mas / pix and a @xmath4 offset from north for the camera columns @xcite .",
    "we did not apply any advanced loci processing to analyze the data .",
    "our observations are summarized in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "relative photometry was performed with iraf s * apphot * tasks using aperture sizes that maximized the signal - to - noise of the companion .",
    "generally , this was 11.4 times the fwhm of a point source .",
    "the apparent magnitude for the companion at k@xmath5 is estimated by correcting the 2mass ks magnitude of @xmath6 for the primary as described by @xcite , namely k@xmath5k @xmath7(h  k ) and using the relationship between k and ks described by @xcite .",
    "hd  23514 then has a k@xmath5 magnitude of @xmath8 , not too different from the ks magnitude . for the coronographic data , the primary",
    "is attenuated by a factor of 28.57 and 27.80 for the 600 and 800  mas diameter spot , respectively ( r.  galicher , private communication , 2011 ) .",
    "multiple short exposures were obtained with integration times range from 10 - 60 seconds , as listed in table  [ tab : data ] , and the companion is clearly visible in most of the individual frames .",
    "the primary is saturated in the 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 ks and k@xmath5 long exposures .",
    "the individual frames were registered to shorter , unsaturated frames using iraf s * xregister * task .",
    "photometry for these paired observations is performed with the same aperture size , but takes into account the different exposure times .",
    "we measure the candidate companion at a separation of @xmath9  with position angle @xmath10  in our 2010 coronographic observations .",
    "the object has remained at the same location between epoch 2006 and 2010 ( see table  [ tab : meas ] and figure  [ fig : image ] ) . had this been a more distant background object , then , based on the primary s proper and parallactic motion ( @xmath11 mas / yr , @xmath12 mas / yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , after 5 years this object should have been separated by @xmath13  and had a pa of @xmath14  ( see figure  [ fig : location ] ) . as mentioned in section  [ results ] , the 2006 adi data is somewhat unreliable as evidenced by the large uncertainties in table  [ tab : meas ] .",
    "comparison from 2007 yields an expected position of a background source of @xmath15  with pa of @xmath16 . over this shorter 4-year baseline , a background object can be ruled out at the @xmath212-@xmath17 level",
    ". the consistent values for separation and pa for the object from 2006 to 2010 imply this is a companion to the system or is a nearby co - moving pleiades member , a possibility we address in section  [ pleiad ] .",
    "the quoted photometry and astrometry in table  [ tab : meas ] is the average of all the frames and the uncertainties are standard deviations of the individual measurements .",
    "the more precise astrometry present in the latter epochs is possible since both the primary and secondary are detected and are unsaturated in the same frame .",
    "a companion 6.8 magnitudes fainter than the primary f6 star at ks would be a late - m dwarf ( see section  [ results ] ) .",
    "the j  ks and h ",
    "ks colors of this object are also consistent with being late - m ( @xmath2m79 ; see @xcite ) . the j ",
    "h color is somewhat discrepant being bluer than expected ; however , as shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , the measurement is consistent given the uncertainties .",
    "evolutionary models for a 100-myr old f6 star like hd  23514 ( 1.35  m@xmath1 and @xmath18  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict an absolute ks magnitude of about 2.5 @xcite giving a distance modulus of 5.65 and a distance of 135  pc .",
    "an additional distance estimate can be obtained by considering that this star is part of the pleiades , which lies 133.5  pc away ( @xcite ; see also table  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the pleiades extends nearly 10  in diameter ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; if we assume a spherical distribution , this amounts to a possible radial extent of 11.7  pc .",
    "hence , the distance to hd  23514 would be somewhere between 122  pc and 145  pc ; we adopt a distance of @xmath19  pc . considering our ks photometry , the companion has @xmath20ks",
    "= @xmath21 , which when comparing with the 2mass photometry for hd  23514 gives an apparent magnitude of ks = @xmath22 . for our adopted distance ,",
    "the absolute ks magnitude of the companion is @xmath23 .    to estimate the mass of the companion we make use of low - mass / substellar evolutionary models .",
    "the dusty evolutionary models of @xcite take into account the formation of condensates in the atmosphere and are appropriate for low - temperature objects down to @xmath21300  k. with these models , a 100  myr object with absolute k magnitude 9.27 would have a mass somewhere 0.06 and 0.07 solar masses and effective temperature @xmath22700  k. the evolutionary models of @xcite use the nextgen dust - free atmospheres and are appropriate for objects with @xmath24  k. these models similarly predict @xmath25  k and mass @xmath20.050.06 solar masses when compared to the ks - band photometry .",
    "the j and h - band photometry suggest somewhat lower masses ( down to 0.05  solar masses ) and cooler temperatures ( @xmath22500  k ) . combining all results together",
    ", we can infer that the companion has a mass of @xmath26 solar masses .",
    "this is below the stellar / substellar boundary making the object a brown dwarf .",
    "the temperature , likewise , appears to be @xmath27  k , placing it at spectral type @xmath2m7 ( see figure  2 in @xcite ) , consistent with the near - infared colors @xcite .",
    "no other object is detected in the @xmath28 field of view . at the distance",
    "to hd  23514 , this amounts to a radius of 675  au .",
    "figure  [ fig : limit ] presents the 5@xmath17 magnitude limit as a function of distance from the primary for the two coronographic ks observations ( 2009 and 2010 ) .",
    "these are our best limits for hd  23514 .",
    "limits are obtained by performing aperture photometry over blank regions of the sky at annuli surrounding the primary .",
    "these limits are averaged over the multiple frames .",
    "no companion is detected with a limit of @xmath21112 magnitudes beyond 1.5 ( @xmath2200  au ) .",
    "this suggests an absolute magnitude limit of @xmath214 at ks , or a mass of nearly @xmath211 jupiter masses when compared to evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "the average ks magnitude for the secondary , 14.92 , differs from the k@xmath5 magnitude , 15.40 , by half a magnitude .",
    "a late - m star is expected to have h ",
    "ks@xmath20.5 , which suggests k@xmath5ks@xmath20.1 , not enough to account the difference . however , the uncertainty in our k@xmath5 photometry is the highest of our measurements , at nearly 0.4 magnitudes .",
    "for the 2006 data , the uncertainty is a result of the larger aperture size ( @xmath29 fwhm ) needed as the m - type companion is smeared out in the adi exposures . for 2007 and 2008 ,",
    "the primary is saturated and the secondary s flux ( and location ) is compared to separate , shorter exposures as described in section  [ observations ] .",
    "the high uncertainty , combined with the expected difference in the k@xmath5 and ks filters is enough to account for the discrepancy .      while the common motion with hd  23514a is suggestive , there exists the possibility that the observed object may be a more distant ( or closer ) free - floating pleiades brown dwarf . as a member of the pleiades",
    ", it would have about the same proper motion and thus appear to be co - moving with hd  23514 . the most robust way to ascertain",
    "this would be to observe the system over many years in order to detect ( or rule out ) orbital motion . however , statistical arguments suggest the brown dwarf is indeed bound to hd  23514 .",
    "@xcite used a group of surveys to estimate the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs in the pleiades .",
    "hd  23514 is located about 1.7 degrees from the center ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; @xcite ) . at that distance , @xcite suggest a brown dwarf ( mass @xmath32  m@xmath33 ) density of 2.7 per square degree .",
    "however , more recent studies performed by @xcite and @xcite suggest average brown dwarf ( mass @xmath34  m@xmath33 ) densities of 7.8 and 6.3 per square degree , respectively .",
    "@xcite surveyed the pleiades in fields located 0.75 to 3.5 degrees away from the field center , @xcite incorporated that survey and in addition also covered the center of the pleiades with ukidss .",
    "thus , the area covered by these deeper surveys is similar in radial extent as that in @xcite ( @xcite ; out to 2.2  degrees from the center ) , but the density of brown dwarfs is larger by a factor of about 2 than the average brown dwarf density of 4.2 per square degree found by @xcite . to account for these deeper surveys ( mass @xmath34  m@xmath33 ) ,",
    "we scale the density provided by @xcite and find that , at hd  23514 s distance from the center of the pleiades , the density of brown dwarfs is about @xmath25 per square degree .",
    "the nirc2 field of view is @xmath35 , or an area of @xmath36 square degrees .",
    "the likelihood of finding a free - floating pleiades brown dwarf with mass @xmath37m@xmath33 in the field of view is thus about @xmath38 .",
    "the small likelihood derived lends weight to the idea this is a bound companion .",
    "there are few brown dwarf companions known to stellar primaries ( the well - known  brown dwarf desert \" phenomenon ; @xcite ) .",
    "even though the frequency of brown dwarf companions at separations @xmath3930  au is small  estimated to range from 0.5% to nearly 20% ( see discussion in @xcite ) ",
    "hd 23514b is more likely to be a bound companion than an isolated pleiades brown dwarf .",
    "if we assume the orbit is circular and face - on , we can use the measured projected separation to estimate the yearly orbital motion of the system .",
    "given a mass of 1.35m@xmath33 , we estimate a period of @xmath26000  years .",
    "this yields an angular motion of 0.06 degrees per year or a linear motion of @xmath22.8  mas per year .",
    "this is comparable to our astrometric precision in our later epochs ( see table  [ tab : meas ] ) , suggesting a baseline of at least 5 more years would be needed to confirm orbital motion .",
    "however , the yearly motion is likely to be smaller as the orbit may be inclined and/or eccentric .",
    "it is instructive to consider whether or not a substellar object at that separation will remain bound over the 100  myr lifetime of the pleiades .",
    "figure  [ fig : binde ] presents the binding energy of resolved stellar and substellar binaries in the pleiades ( from @xcite ) .",
    "note that since inclination and eccentricity are typically not available for these systems ( and certainly not for hd  23514 ) , the true binding energy may be somewhat different than plotted here . despite not being the most widely separated binary in the pleiades ( @xcite  present systems at @xmath2900  au ) , hd  23514",
    "does have the lowest binding energy among the stellar mass binaries .",
    "however , substellar pleiades binaries with separations @xmath4020  au have comparable or lower binding energies .",
    "the similar binding energies suggests that stellar interactions within the pleiades , while more frequent than in the field , may not be enough to disrupt the hd  23514 system in timescales much shorter than 100  myr .",
    "we note that hip  78530 @xcite and 1rxs  j160929.1210524 @xcite both host substellar companions at wide separations in the 5  myr - old upper scorpius region .",
    "these are considered physically bound based on common proper motion , similar to the case of hd  23514 .",
    "however , both systems have estimated binding energies lower than that of hd  23514 .",
    "previous searches for brown dwarf companions in the pleaides have focused on low - mass stars or free - floating brown dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used adaptive optics to observe 144 g- and k - type stars in the pleiades .",
    "the lowest mass companion they found was 0.15  m@xmath1 , though they were sensitive to objects with masses down to @xmath20.03  m@xmath1 at separations of @xmath21 .",
    "a deeper study conducted by @xcite also looked at solar - type stars , but found no substellar companions among @xmath220 pleaides stars .",
    "hence , while there may be hundreds of free - floating brown dwarfs in the pleaides @xcite , this is the first brown dwarf detected as a companion to a sun - like star .",
    "the scarcity of companion brown dwarfs to the @xmath2300 solar - type stars in the pleiades @xcite is consistent with the findings of a brown dwarf desert among solar - type stars out to separations of @xmath21000  au @xcite .",
    "hd  23514 is surrounded by a substantial amount of warm ( @xmath2700  k ) dust in a thin ring located @xmath20.25  au from the star if the emission comes from large blackbody grains or at most a few au if the grains are smaller and radiate less efficiently @xcite . at a distance of 135  pc ,",
    "the companion in figure  [ fig : image ] has a projected separation of about 360  au , far larger than the dust semi - major axis .",
    "only a handful of systems are known to contain substantial quantities ( @xmath41 ) of warm dust : cha - near member ef  cha @xcite , @xmath42  pic member hd  172555 @xcite , lower centaurus crux member hd  113766 @xcite , ab dor member hd  15407 @xcite , m47 member p1121 @xcite , and ngc2547 member id8 @xcite .",
    "bd+20  307 is another main - sequence star known to contain a large amount of warm dust @xcite , however it is much older ( @xmath21  gyr ) than these other systems @xcite . of these 8 systems ,",
    "hd  23514 , hd  15407 , hd  172555 , bd+20  307 , and hd  113766 are known to be binary or triple systems .",
    "all are wide separation systems ( @xmath43100  au ) with the exception of bd+20  307 , whose separation is only about 0.05  au ( though with a high probability of a third more distant , and as yet unseen , object ; see @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , hd  23514 , hd  15407 , and hd  172555 all exhibit signs of silica emission suggesting high - velocity impacts produced the dust in the system @xcite .",
    "binaries with separations of a few tens of au are less likely to contain substantial amounts of dust when compared with single stars or with wide separation binaries @xcite .",
    "however , if hd  23514 hosts a tertiary companion , say a close - in planet , whose initial inclination is different than that of the substellar companion , the kozai mechanism @xcite can work to disrupt its orbit by continuously changing the inclination and eccentricity .",
    "this can potentially stir up planetesimals in the system and thus enhance collisions in the terrestrial zone ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggests a catastrophic or even planet - planet collision to account for the large amount of dust in the system . such an event could take place if the eccentricity of a planet or large planetesimal is sufficiently increased through the kozai mechanism .",
    "a large eccentricity can lead to high - velocity impacts near periastron , which can account for the silica emission observed in the system .",
    "equation  36 in @xcite can be used to estimate the period of the eccentricity oscillation of this tertiary body . for a planet or planetesimal at 5  au , and assuming hd  23514b s orbit is circular and its projected separation is the semi - major axis , the period is @xmath280  myr . while there are many unknowns , it is interesting to note that this is comparable to the age of the system .",
    "further monitoring of the system , as well as deeper searches for any additional companions closer to the star , will be key in determining the relationship , if any , between the secondary companion and the dust around the primary .",
    "using adaptive optics imaging at keck , we have discovered a substellar companion to the dusty pleiades star hd  23514 . based on comparison with evolutionary models",
    ", we estimate the companion to have a mass of about @xmath26m@xmath33 and temperature @xmath27  k. to our knowledge , hii  1348 and hd  23514 are the only pleiades stars known to have brown dwarf companions @xcite .",
    "hd  23514 is one of the dustiest main - sequence stars known to date with @xmath0 . the warm dust present in the system",
    "is located within a few au of the primary .",
    "in contrast , the companion has a projected separation of @xmath2360  au . at that distance , the companion s gravity is expected to have little influence over the evolution of the warm dust seen around the primary .",
    "however , if a tertiary object were present in the system very close to the star , the kozai mechanism can affect its orbit and possibly enhance collisions that generate dust .",
