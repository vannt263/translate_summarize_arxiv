    "the effective medium concept has proven to be very useful for modelling composite materials with periodic microstructure .",
    "efficient methods exist for computing the effective elastic moduli under static and quasistatic conditions .",
    "a more challenging task is to define frequency - dependent dynamic effective constants which are capable of describing phononic band gaps of the wave spectrum @xcite at the expense of non - classical features such as negative @xcite and tensorial @xcite density .",
    "effective material models that can retain a dispersive signature of the initial material microarchitecture have significant potential application in the design of sonic metamaterials .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an analytical formulation for the effective material parameters of a periodic elastic medium at finite frequency .",
    "a general framework for describing dynamic effective medium theories has been developed by willis , beginning with variational arguments for non - local behavior in mechanical @xcite and electromagnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the predicted constitutive relations modify both the elasticity @xcite and the inertia @xcite , and include coupling between stress / strain on the one hand and momentum / velocity on the other , see @xcite for a review .",
    "the notion of anisotropic inertia has appeared in several mechanical contexts , such as stratified layers of fluids @xcite and elastic composites with strongly contrasting constituents @xcite .",
    "coupling between particle velocity and stress , although not usually considered in constitutive theories for continua , is to be expected for theories relating spatial means of these quantities because of the underlying inhomogeneity of the displacement and stress fields within the region being averaged .",
    "interest in the willis constitutive model has intensified with the observation @xcite that the non - classical material properties could be realized , in theory at least , by suitably designed microstructures with internal springs , masses , and gyroscopes .",
    "derivations of the willis equations have been demonstrated for periodic systems in 1d @xcite and 3d nasser11b , and the structure of the equations has been rigorously proved for both electromagnetic and elastic materials @xcite .    despite the growing awareness that the willis constitutive model is the proper dynamic effective medium formulation for periodic systems",
    "there is as yet no simple means of calculating the effective material parameters at finite frequency .",
    "several different techniques have been proposed to address this deficiency , none of which is easily implemented for arbitrary 3d problems .",
    "thus , closed form expressions were obtained in @xcite for 1d stratification using floquet modes , where the latter have to be determined numerically .",
    "a more general numerical technique has recently been developed and applied to 1d @xcite and 3d @xcite composites .",
    "this approach employs a background or reference material , and solves for the polarization field ( difference in stress / momentum between the actual and that of a comparison body @xcite ) to arrive at expressions for the effective parameters in terms of system matrices . the numerical procedure , which uses a combination of plane wave expansions and discretization schemes , is complicated by the required selection of a comparison material",
    ", the choice of which has no bearing on the final outcome . a quite different technique @xcite suited to 1d - periodically stratified elastic solids uses the monodromy matrix ( i.e. , propagator for a single period ) to explicitly define effective material parameters from its logarithm .",
    "all of these methods derive the density , stiffness and the coupling parameter , @xmath0 , as functions of frequency and wavenumber .",
    "this means , perhaps surprisingly , that equations of willis form but with different parameters can be obtained for the same medium , depending on the homogenization scheme employed , an aspect discussed in  [ sec6 ] .",
    "our purpose here is to develop , in so far as possible , analytical expressions for the dynamic effective material parameters of a periodic elastic material .",
    "the homogenization scheme seeks the constitutive relations and the equations of dynamic equilibrium governing the spatial average of the _ periodic _ part of the bloch wave solution .",
    "the initial heterogeneous system is here assumed to be defined by pointwise constitutive equations of the form proposed by willis , which includes classical elastodynamics as the case of isotropic density and zero coupling between stress and momentum .",
    "we show that the homogenized equations are also of willis form with dynamic effective material parameters that are non - local in space and time , thus demonstrating that the willis constitutive theory is self - consistent and closed .",
    "the homogenized effective parameters are conveniently expressed in terms of plane wave expansions ( pwe ) of the original material parameters , and accordingly we call this the pwe method .",
    "this approach allows us to define effective constants for any frequency - wavenumber combination , including , but not restricted to , values of @xmath1 on the bloch wave branches .",
    "we begin in ",
    "[ sec2 ] with an overview of the willis constitutive equations followed by a summary of the pwe homogenization results .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to the derivation of the pwe effective material parameters for a scalar wave model that is simpler than the fully elastic problem , but which exhibits the main features of the homogenization scheme .",
    "the elastodynamic effective parameters are obtained in  [ sec4 ] and some of their properties are examined in  [ sec5 ] .",
    "examples of the pwe effective moduli are provided in ",

    "one of the principal results of the paper is that , given the periodic medium with the willis form ( [ = 64 ] ) of the governing equations ( which incorporates classical elastodynamics model ) , the equations describing relations between the effective wave fields @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 $ ] and the effective forcing @xmath73 and @xmath74 are also of willis form : @xmath75the effective parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are non - local in both space and time ( despite the fact that the exact parameters of the original periodic material are stationary ) .",
