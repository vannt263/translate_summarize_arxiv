    "a key strategic objective of the _ integral _ mission ( winkler et al . 2003 ) is a survey of the sky at high energies ( @xmath0 20 kev ) , the domain where fundamental changes from primarily thermal to non - thermal sources / phenomena are expected , where the effects of absorption are drastically reduced and where most of the extreme astrophysical behaviour are taking place . to survey the high energy sky ,",
    "_ integral _ makes use of the unique imaging capability of the ibis instrument ( ubertini et al .",
    "2003 ) , which allows the detection of sources at the mcrab flux level with an angular resolution of 12@xmath1 and a point source location accuracy of typically 13@xmath1 within a large ( @xmath2 degrees ) field of view .",
    "so far , several surveys produced from data collected by ibis have been reported in the literature , the most complete being that of bird et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which lists more than 700 sources of a diverse nature ( galactic and extra - galactic ) and class .",
    "however , a large fraction ( @xmath330% ) of these new _ integral _ sources has no obvious counterpart in other wavebands and can not be firmly classified ; their classification is a primary objective of the survey work but it is made very difficult by the large ibis error circles .",
    "improved arcsecond - sized localization is therefore necessary to pinpoint the optical counterpart and through spectroscopic observations assess its nature / class ( masetti et al .",
    "2010 ) . for source identification one relies mostly on x - ray observations , but data in other wavebands can be used as well for counterpart search , in particular in those cases where the _ integral _ unidentified source may be associated with an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .    within this framework , in the present paper we present a new method for agn identification in the 4th ibis catalogue , which relies on cross - correlating unidentified sources first with infrared ( ir ) and then with radio catalogues .",
    "the method is a posteriori verified by means of x - ray and optical follow up observations of some of the sources discussed in the paper , which allow exploring their nature .    in the first step we use a set of extended ir objects ( 2mass extended catalogue , skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) 97% of which are associated with galaxies ; we note that this is one of the most complete lists of galaxies available as it covers also the galactic plane .",
    "then we search for radio emission from these galaxies in order to identify likely agn .",
    "this second step is justified by the fact that almost all agn detected so far by _ integral _ have a radio counterpart , which is not necessary radio - loud but can emit at a few mjy level .    an object which is extragalactic in nature and radio emitting , could also be a starburst galaxy but , in this case , we would not expect a bright x - ray luminosity as typically seen above 20 kev with currently operating hard x - ray detectors ; indeed , so far , no starburst galaxy has been detected by ibis in the 20100 kev energy band .",
    "hence we use the ir , or better the information on source extension provided by the 2mass extended catalogue , to pinpoint galaxies and then the information available from radio and hard x - ray emissions to look for agn .",
    "we emphasize that many unidentified objects in the ibis survey are on the galactic plane , so that identification of these sources as agn is not straightforward .",
    "our method however provides a way to overcome problems related to the identification of active galaxies in the `` zone of avoidance '' .",
    "our choice of ir and radio catalogues is not intended to be a way to select special types of agn , but rather a simple way to find galaxies among galactic and extragalactic sources and to select , among them , agn associated with hard x - ray selected objects .",
    "x - ray follow up observations are instead used to provide confirmation of the proposed ir / radio and hard x - ray association while optical spectroscopy is performed to test the source agn nature and class .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sect .",
    "2 describes the sample selection criteria and gives an overview of the extracted sample ; the multiwavelength observations and analyses are reported in sect .",
    "3 , while results and discussion are shown in sect .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "the present work supersedes the analysis carried out in maiorano et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , in which preliminary results for only three sources of the sample were presented .",

    "historically , agns were discovered with radio observations , i.e. the radio selection is often a way to recognize active galaxies , except at lower luminosities where star - formation in galaxies can produce radio emission .",
    "therefore , for bright objects , a mere detection in radio provides support for the presence of an active galaxy .",
    "sample contamination from galactic sources may however come from pulsars , microquasars and cataclismic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "in many cases , association with a galaxy via cross - correlation with galaxy catalogues can help in selecting only extragalactic objects and , by means of the radio detection , pinpointing those sources that are likely agns .",
    "so , while a mere radio detection does not imply an identification with an agn , its combination with high energy x / gamma - ray emission , together with the association with a galaxy , strongly argues in favour of the identification of an unclassified _ integral _ source with an active galaxy . following this reasoning",
    "we have cross - correlated our set of unidentified _ integral _ sources in the 4th ibis catalogue ( bird et al .",
    "2010 ) with ir / radio catalogues , in order to extract a small sample of objects likely associated with an agn .    for the ir bands we have used the two micron",
    "all sky survey extended ( 2masx ) source catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) which is a powerful tool to identify , within the sample of unidentified _ integral _ sources , those possibly associated with galaxies . for this survey ,",
    "the entire sky was uniformly scanned in three near - infrared ( nir ) bands ( j , h , k ) to detect and characterise sources brighter than about 1 mjy in each band , with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 10 and which are resolved and extended beyond the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) beam / point spread function . the absolute astrometric accuracy of the 2masx catalogue is better than one arcsec .",
    "the extended source catalogue consists of 1,647,599 objects , 97% of which are galaxies while the remaining @xmath33% is made of sources in the milky way ( mostly double and triple stars , hii regions , planetary and reflection nebulae ) , which are not expected to emit at high energies .",
    "therefore , the presence of a 2masx object inside the ibis error circle suggests an association with a galaxy .    as radio catalogues we have used the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss , mauch et al . 2003 ) which are particularly well suited for finding counterparts of unidentified _ integral _ sources : they are similar in sensitivity and spatial resolution and together they cover the whole sky .",
    "the nvss catalogue covers the sky north of the j2000.0 declination of 40 degrees ( 82% of the celestial sphere ) at 1.4 ghz ( 20 cm ) .",
    "the catalogue consists of almost 2 million discrete sources stronger than a flux density of about 2.5 mjy .",
    "the nvss images have 45 arcsecond fwhm angular resolution and nearly uniform sensitivity .",
    "the _ rms _ uncertainties in right ascension and declination vary from about 1@xmath4 for the 400,000 sources",
    "stronger than 15 mjy to 7@xmath4 at the survey limit .",
    "the sumss catalogue covers instead the sky south of the j2000.0 declination of 30 degrees ( @xmath320% of the celestial sphere ) and is carried out at 843 mhz ( 36 cm ) .",
    "the survey consists of @xmath5 mosaic images with a resolution of @xmath6 cosec@xmath7 arcsec@xmath8 , and a _ rms _ noise level of 1 - 2 mjy / beam .",
    "positions in the catalogue are accurate to within 1 - 2@xmath4 for sources with peak brightness @xmath020 mjy / beam , and are always better than 10@xmath1 .",
    "the internal flux density scale is accurate to within 3% .",
    "the radio detection of a 2masx emitting galaxy strongly indicates that the source is an agn if also detected above 10 kev .    to perform the correlation , we used the standard statistical technique which has been employed very successfully in other cases ( stephen et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2010 ) .",
    "this consists of simply calculating the number of _ integral _ sources for which at least one 2masx counterpart was within a specified distance , out to a distance where all _ integral _ sources had at least one nir counterpart . to have a control group we created a list of fake `` anti-_integral _ '' sources . for every object in",
    "the _ integral _ list , we made a corresponding source in the fake list with coordinates mirrored in galactic longitude and latitude ( this mirroring was chosen due to the strong galactic component evident in the _ integral _ distribution ) , and the same correlation algorithm was then applied between this list and the 2masx catalogue .",
    "subtracting from the number of correlations in the true list those obtained in the false sample , it is possible to estimate the number of true associations .",
    "we see that the radius at which the first correlations between the `` anti- _ integral _ '' sources sample and 2masx catalogue appear is about 6 arcmin .",
    "this is comparable with the size of the ibis error circle radius , therefore we expect at most 1 spurious correlation within the lot of selected sources ( see below ) .",
    "the sample of associations extracted in this way , i.e. a list of objects likely associated with galaxies , was then cross - correlated to the radio catalogues following the same method .    by means of this sequence of cross - correlations",
    "we extracted a final sample of 8 objects which are seen in all 3 wavebands ( hard x - rays , nir and radio ) ; all 8 can be considered as agn candidates because they are classified as galaxies in the 2masx and are detected both in radio and hard x - rays .",
    "note that in one case we have two radio / nir objects associated with a unique _ integral _ source ( igr j21441 + 4640 ) ; both are detected in the 2masx and radio catalogues and so are equally possible counterparts of the _ integral _ source and as such will be considered in the following sections . in nasa / ipac extragalactic database",
    "( ned ) these two objects form a galaxy pair .",
    "all objects in the sample are reported in table 1 ; for each source we list the _ integral _ name , the ibis position with relative error , the ir ( 2masx ) and radio ( nvss or sumss ) positions and associated errors of the putative counterparts . in our sample ,",
    "7 sources have a counterpart in the nvss catalogue while only one has an association in the sumss .",
    "the 2masx catalogue provides j , h , k magnitudes for all sources in the sample which are reported in table 2 ; note that all objects listed in table 2 are classified as galaxies in ned . in table 2",
    "we also show the nir colour indices j  h and h  k ; these can be used as a tool to confirm the agn nature of our sources .",
    "indeed , all objects but one ( 2masx j03095498 + 5707023 ) have nir colours compatible with those of nearby active galaxies ( see fig . 1 of kouzuma & yamaoka , 2010 ) . despite the uncertainties introduced by this method (",
    "i.e. it is not obvious from the work of kouzuma & yamaoka [ 2010 ] , which is the efficiency of finding an agn via ir photometry ) , it is reassuring that almost all of our objects are compatible with nir agn colour indices .",
    "hard x - ray information concerning the sources of our sample is reported in bird et al .",
    "we note here that all but two objects are classified as variable in the 4th ibis catalogue since they are detected at the level of revolution , revolution sequence or through the bursticity analysis ; the only exceptions are igr j055831257 and igr j081903835 which are reported as persistent objects in the ibis survey .",
    "all but 3 objects ( igr j03103 + 5706 , igr j08190 - 3835 , igr j21441 + 4640 ) are at galactic latitude @xmath9 an additional argument in favour of their extragalactic nature .    in order to provide radio images and fluxes , we have used the standard procedure employed within the software package aips , release 31dec10 ( astronomical image processing system ) .",
    "nvss / sumss fluxes extracted from the radio maps are reported in table 3 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the collection of nvss / sumss image cut - outs for all of our sources with overimposed ibis error circle and 2masx source positions . for two sources",
    "( igr j00556 + 7708 , igr j21268 + 6203 ) in our sample the radio and nir positions are significantly different from each other , being separated by 22@xmath4 and 24@xmath4 , respectively . in both cases we searched among the optical and nir catalogues selected in the vizier catalogues selection page ( usno - b1 , monet et al .",
    "2003 , usno - a2.0 , 2mass ) , but we could not find any optical or nir counterparts within the radio error circle ; furthermore , we note that the 2masx galaxies lie in each case within the edge of the radio contours and are obviously extended in the nir band ( semimajor axis of 16.6@xmath4 and 13.7@xmath4 , respectively ) .",
    "indeed , in both cases the 2masx and radio objects are associated with each other in ned on the basis of a sophisticated cross - identification analysis which takes into account not only the positional uncertainty but also the source extension ( mazzarella et al . 2001 ) .",
    "taking all these evidences into account , we decide to keep both _",
    "integral _ sources in the sample also in view of the fact that either the nir or the radio object ( or in the best case both ) are likely counterparts to the high energy emitter .",
    "by looking for further radio information in the data archives of different radio telescopes and also in the literature , we found that some sources in the sample have been observed at more than one radio frequency . in these few cases",
    "we have calculated the radio spectral index using the available data points and the usual relation f@xmath10 ( see sect .",
    "3 ) . furthermore ,",
