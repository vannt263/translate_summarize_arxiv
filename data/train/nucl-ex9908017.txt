    "was regularly checked with a lead glass detector ( @xmath52 for photons ) in calibration runs at low beam intensity .",
    "the photon polarization was determined from the photon spectrum measured by the tagging spectrometer in coincidence with the pair detector and with the aid of theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "the quality of these calculations was tested by an absolute measurement of the photon polarization using coherent @xmath53 photoproduction on @xmath54 as a polarimeter reaction with an analyzing power @xmath55 .",

    "no empty target subtraction was needed .",
    "the main contributions to the systematic error in the determination of the unpolarized differential cross section are due to uncertainties in the photon flux ( @xmath56 ) , the target density ( @xmath73 ) and ( @xmath56 ) for the proton / pion separation with the range method .",

    "this approach is also useful if the general resonance structure is already known and the main interest is to obtain the small partial wave amplitudes .",

    "in contrast the difference of @xmath160 for @xmath178 shows a strong angular dependence at all energies .",

    "the ratio r can be identified with the @xmath38 value , @xmath234 this is the key point of our analysis .",
    "the method has the advantage of being independent of absolute normalization and insensitive to many systematic errors , because @xmath38 is extracted from the ratio of the coefficients @xmath235 and @xmath236 fitted to the angular distribution of @xmath217 . analyzing the data by this method",
    "the following result is obtained  @xcite : @xmath237 without any correction for neglecting the isospin @xmath136 contributions to @xmath169 and @xmath151 , the maximum absolute systematic error for @xmath38 would be @xmath238 . to further reduce this systematic error one",

    "the absolute systematic error reduces to less than @xmath239 ( see appendix b for details ) .      to obtain the isospin decomposition for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 waves in the whole energy range ( @xmath240 ) , we have performed an energy independent multipole analysis of our data . in this analysis",
    "we fit @xmath120 parameters , the absolute values of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 waves for isospin @xmath136 and @xmath13 ( @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath3 , @xmath244 , @xmath4 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 ) , to the photon asymmetry and the differential cross section for the @xmath215 and @xmath200 reaction channels .",
    "higher partial waves ( @xmath125 ) are taken into account by the born terms , including @xmath247 and @xmath248 exchange in the @xmath249-channel .",
    "we obtain the coefficients @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 from the angular distribution of the differential cross section and @xmath163 from the photon asymmetry .",
    "the two pion reaction channels are decribed by @xmath120 coefficients , which are independent combinations of the isospin @xmath136 and @xmath13 multipole amplitudes of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 waves .",
    "in addition the fermi ",
    "watson theorem is used to determine the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath42 and @xmath43wave multipole amplitudes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] we show our fitted multipole amplitudes as @xmath253 , which is the absolute value of the amplitude up to a sign that can change with photon energy as in the case of @xmath4 .",

    "the results for the isospin components for the @xmath42 and @xmath43wave amplitudes are presented for 16 photon energy bins@xcite .",
    "although systematic errors are greatly reduced because the @xmath104 and @xmath105 data are obtained with the same set up , this method is sensitive to small remaining systematic differences in the results of @xmath122 and @xmath75 for the two pion channels , because it relates 8 parameters to the 8 `` observables '' ( a , b , c and @xmath163 coefficients for the two pion channels ) .",
    "including additional polarization observables in the database and performing an energy dependent multipole analysis overcomes these shortcomings .      in a third analysis",
    "the mami pion photoproduction data are analyzed using fixed ",
    "t dispersion relations based on lorentz invariance , isospin symmetry , unitarity and crossing symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this analysis includes the recent mami data for the differential cross section @xmath122 and photon asymmetry @xmath75 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 from the proton  @xcite , both older and more recent data from bonn for the target asymmetry @xmath124 @xcite , and differential cross section data on @xmath254 production off the neutron from frascati  @xcite and recently from triumf  @xcite .    with this method we performed both an energy dependent and an energy independent multipole fit as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e2m1 ] by open circles ( energy independent ) and the solid line ( energy dependent ) .",
    "the agreement between the @xmath255 and @xmath256 multipole results obtained from the dispersion analysis and the multipole analysis described in the previous section is very good .",
    "both energy independent results show the same energy behavior for the two multipoles . for the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath256 amplitude the two results are in excellent agreement , the solid dots lying on top of the open circles up to @xmath257 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : e2m1 ] ) .",
    "the agreement is also very good in the case of the small @xmath255 amplitude . in particular , we find that the inclusion of other observables in addition to the mami pion photoproduction data decreases the fluctuations slightly for the @xmath255 multipole .",
    "the results of the energy dependent fit ( solid line in fig .  [ fig : e2m1 ] ) agree well with the @xmath151 multipole derived from the energy independent fit , but small systematic differences may be seen for the electric multipole @xmath169 at energies above the @xmath27 resonance ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath38 at the resonance agrees quite well in both dispersion analyses , @xmath259 for the energy dependent fit and @xmath260 for the energy independent fit .",
    "in addition we have checked the effect of changes in the database .",
    "replacing our differential cross section by the bonn data obtained in the seventies @xcite reproduces the results for the leading multipoles but changes the smaller multipoles to some degree ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : rem ] ) .",
    "the bonn results for @xmath122 at very forward and backward angles force the fit to a smaller @xmath169 value near the resonance .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the overall compilation of the bonn @xmath61 data by genzel et al .",
    "@xcite results from different experimental setups , which have been re  appraised and re  evaluated before combining them into one data set .",
    "the main part of the angular distribution ( @xmath261 ) for @xmath122 was measured by detecting the recoil proton in a magnetic spectrometer @xcite , i.e. by fixed angle and single energy measurements .",
    "the differential cross section for @xmath262 was measured by detecting the two decay photons of the @xmath53 with lead glass blocks in a different experiment @xcite .",
    "each of these experiments has a systematic error of the order of @xmath263 , and it takes much less than this systematic error to change the shape of @xmath122 ( @xmath264 ratio ) and with this the @xmath38 value .    in the case of the legs data the larger cross section leads to larger values for the resonant multipoles @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the main reason for this is that the cross section difference between the legs and mami data is energy dependent ( resonance behavior ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pa90 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pa85 ] .",
    "inclusion of the polarization data @xmath124 , @xmath75 and @xmath123 from kharkov @xcite does not affect our fit because of the large statistical and systematic errors especially for the @xmath61 channel .",
    "according to the fermi  watson theorem the @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath3 partial waves have the same phase @xmath265 and the ratio @xmath266 is a real quantity . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e2m1_pa ] , this ratio is strongly dependent on the photon energy and varies from @xmath267 at @xmath171 to @xmath268 at @xmath173 .",
    "the ratio @xmath38 is defined at the @xmath27 resonance position , where @xmath181 , by @xmath269 we note that within the k  matrix fomalism this ratio is free of background contributions since @xmath270 is the k  matrix pole .",
    "the extraction of the genuine @xmath27resonance parts of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole multipoles is model dependent , see for example the work on dynamical models  @xcite and the recently proposed speed plot analysis  @xcite . in order to get a reliable value for @xmath38",
    "it is important to use a database with small angle dependent systematic errors , because the small @xmath169 amplitude depends on the shape of @xmath122 and the absolute magnitude of the photon asymmetry at @xmath212 . to obtain a consistent separation for the isospin @xmath136 and @xmath13 parts of the partial waves ,",
    "experimental data are required with small inconsistencies in the absolute normalization between the @xmath61 and @xmath80 observables . to reduce the influence of such systematics in the multipole analysis ,",
    "the observables @xmath75 and @xmath122 for both reaction channels @xmath87 and @xmath86 were simultaneously measured at all angles and energies with the daphne detector at mami .",
    "the three different analyses to extract @xmath38 from the mami data agree very well with each other , and at the @xmath27 resonance we get the final result @xmath271 in addition , the discussions about the extraction of the correct @xmath38 ratio from our data , which arose in the literature after our first publication  @xcite can now be summarized as follows . in the comment of the vpi group  @xcite , our @xmath87 data were included in the said database and a value @xmath272 was obtained .",
    "as pointed out in our reply  @xcite the difference between the vpi result and our value @xmath273 is due to the database used in the said analysis . as has been recently confirmed by the vpi group  @xcite , the exclusion of all pre@xmath274 @xmath104 differential cross section data in the said database changes @xmath38 to @xmath275 .",
    "it is obvious that the key problem arises from the inconsistencies in the different data sets used in the analysis .",
    "the forward and backward angles for the differential cross sections used in the said database force the vpi solution to smaller @xmath38 values",
    ". however , this solution overpredicts the mainz photon asymmetry data at resonance , @xmath276 , compared to the mainz result , @xmath211 .",
    "the reason is that at resonance ( @xmath9 ) the fit has only one parameter , the @xmath38 value , to describe simultaneously the shape of the differential cross section @xmath277 and the photon asymmetry at @xmath212 @xmath278 as we have stated before , the compilation of all the existing experimental data into one database can result in mean values for the dominant multipoles and meaningless values for the small multipoles . for example , if one combines the new mami data with the bonn differential cross section results , then the @xmath38 value is affected by small systematic differences in the two data sets .",
    "the bonn differential cross sections range from @xmath279 to @xmath280 while the mami cross sections cover angles from @xmath281 to @xmath89 and are slightly below the bonn data at @xmath282 . in the combined data set the shape of the differential cross section is changed , i.e. the @xmath264 ratio gets smaller .",
    "this is the main reason that for the combined bonn and mami data set the @xmath38 value is even below the value which one gets from the bonn data alone .",
    "this influence of the bonn data on the extracted value of the ratio @xmath38 has been confirmed by the bnl@xcite and rpi / vpi groups@xcite .    in a second comment  @xcite our @xmath87 data",
    "were analyzed by the rpi group , who obtained the result @xmath283 .",
    "however , the inclusion of our @xmath86 data in the database lowered this value to @xmath284  @xcite , in agreement with our analysis .",
    "we made the first simultaneous and accurate measurements of the differential cross sections and photon asymmetries for the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the @xmath27 region . using this data",
    "we have performed a multipole analysis to obtain the isospin decomposition of the @xmath42 and @xmath43wave multipoles and extract the @xmath7 ratio over the energy range @xmath285 .",
    "our final results at the @xmath27 resonance position ( @xmath181 ) are @xmath286 , and @xmath287 and @xmath288 for the helicity amplitudes .    in the meantime",
    "more @xmath289 data  @xcite for the differential cross section and the photon asymmetry have been taken .",
    "this new experiment covers the full range of polar angles by observing the two decay photons in the taps detector at mami .",
    "the analysis is in progress and will produce new differential cross sections for the extreme forward and backward angles . in this way we hope also to clarify the absolute normalization problem in the differential cross section between legs and mami .",
    "the authors wish to acknowledge the excellent support of k.h .",
    "kaiser and h. euteneuer and the accelerator group of mami , as well as many other scientists and technicians of the institut fr kernphysik at mainz , dapnia/ sphn at saclay and infn at pavia .",
