    "the problem of computing the transverse force acting on a vortex in a superfluid has recently engendered a certain amount of controversy .",
    "if the vortex moves at a velocity @xmath1 while the superfluid and normal components have asymptotic velocities @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , then the most general form of the transverse force per unit length that is consistent with galilean invariance ( _ i.e. _ depends only on velocity differences ) can be written@xcite = a ( _ l-_s ) + b(_l-_n ) . here",
    "@xmath4 is the magnitude of the quantum of circulation about the vortex , = , with @xmath5 the mass of a helium atom , and @xmath6 a unit tangent to the vortex line in the direction of the circulation . in the absence of any normal component ,",
    "elementary fluid mechanics shows that the momentum flux into the vortex core is _",
    "m = _ tot ( _ l-_s ) , where @xmath7 is the total mass density .",
    "this is the magnus force@xcite .",
    "once a normal component is present , however , a variety of different expressions for the coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 have been given in the literature .",
    "it is generally accepted that the coefficient @xmath8 is @xmath10@xcite . an appealing thermodynamic argument for this",
    "has recently been given by wexler@xcite .",
    "the controversy stems from the claim of wexler@xcite , and thouless _",
    "et al._@xcite that the coefficient of @xmath1 in @xmath11 , is also equal to @xmath10 . since this coefficient is @xmath12 , their claim , if true , would force @xmath9 to be zero  thus ruling out the existence of the second term , the _ iordanskii force _ , which is supposed to originate in a left / right asymmetry in the scattering of quasi - particles by the vortex line@xcite .",
    "sonin@xcite , on the other hand , has presented a detailed review of the scattering of phonons by a vortex line at rest with respect to the superflow .",
    "his analysis ( which has been challenged by wexler and thouless@xcite , but which i believe to be correct ) shows that the asymmetry arises from a fluid dynamical analog@xcite of the bohm - aharonov effect@xcite , and gives the coefficient of @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath15 .",
    "combining this value of @xmath9 with the accepted value for @xmath8 gives the transverse part of the force per unit length as = _ s ( _ l-_s ) + _ n ( _ l-_n ) .",
    "[ eq : iordanskii_a ] this is the most commonly accepted expression for the force .",
    "when it is written in this form the first term is usually refered to as the superfluid magnus force and the second term as the iordanskii force .",
    "since the total density is @xmath16 , equation ( [ eq : iordanskii_a ] ) may equally well be written = _ tot ( _ l-_s ) + _ n ( _ s-_n ) .",
    "[ eq : iordanskii_b ] the first part of ( [ eq : iordanskii_b ] ) is the momentum transfer to the vortex due to the condensate motion ( and possibly _ this _ should be called the superfluid magnus force ) , so the second term must be the force on the vortex due to phonon scattering .",
    "part of the phonon force is responsible for reducing the coefficient of @xmath2 from @xmath17 to @xmath10 .",
    "notice that this expression for the phonon force does not depend on the motion of the vortex line relative to either component of the fluid .",
    "although sonin , who works in the frame @xmath18 , writes @xmath19 in his expression for the phonon force , his analysis of the scattering process is restricted to the situation where @xmath20 , _ i.e _ to the case where there is no relative motion between the vortex line and the condensate .",
    "the @xmath2 part of the force is inferred from the thermodynamic and galilean invariance argument given above . a direct demonstration that the phonon force is independent of the relative velocity of the vortex and the condensate , and",
    "hence that coefficient of @xmath2 in the phonon force is indeed equal to @xmath14 , would provide a useful consistency test of the conventional scattering - theory derivation of ( [ eq : iordanskii_a ] ) , because the galilean invariance that went into deducing this coefficient is not manifest in the linearized sound wave equation . in this paper",
    "i will provide such a demonstration . in obtaining the result we will find it useful to consider the analogy , first pointed out by volovik@xcite , of phonon vortex scattering with the _ gravitational _ bohm - aharonov effect where particles are scattered by a spinning cosmic string .",
    "in the next section i will review the acoustic bohm - aharonov effect and rederive sonin s results for the phonon force in the case that the vortex is at rest with respect to the condensate . in section three",
    "i will extend these results to the case in which the vortex moves relative to the condensate , and relate the momentum given to the phonons by the vortex to the time delay of signals passing on either side of a cosmic string . in the last section",
    "i will discuss the apparent conflict between our results and the claims of thouless _",
    "et al . _ , and some possible resolutions .",
    "the scattering of phonons by a superfluid vortex was first studied by fetter@xcite .",
    "the wave equation used by most recent authors @xcite is = c^2 ^2- 2 ( ) .",

    "when the sound field @xmath21 has harmonic time dependence , @xmath24 , equation ( [ eq : soninwexler ] ) becomes -^2=c^2 ^2 + 2i(_v ) .",
    "[ eq : swharmonic ] we will be interested in effects only to first order in the circulation @xmath4 , therefore it is natural to add harmless @xmath25 terms to ( [ eq : swharmonic ] ) so that it becomes the schrdinger equation for unit charge particles minimally coupled to a gauge field @xmath26 , _ viz .",

    "[ eq : bohm - aharonov ] notice that this rewriting requires @xmath27 .    equation ( [ eq : bohm - aharonov ] ) describes the bohm - aharonov interaction of particles with a threadlike tube of magnetic flux in the gauge where @xmath28 .",
    "the total flux in the tube is = d*r*= _ vd*r * = . here",
    "the integration contour surrounds the vortex , which we have taken to be at the origin of our coordinate system .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath29 to denote the ratio of this flux to the dirac flux quantum , @xmath30 .    in their original paper@xcite aharonov and",
    "bohm provided a partial - wave series expansion for scattering of a plane wave by the flux tube .",
    "figures [ fig : bohm.25 ] and [ fig : bohm.5 ] are numerical plots of the sum of the first forty terms in this expansion for the cases where a plane wave is incident from the right on flux tubes with @xmath29 equal to @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "these plots should be compared to the ripple tank photographs of surface waves interacting with a `` bathtub '' vortex in @xcite .",
    "the most noticable feature in both the photographs and the plots is the `` seam '' or `` tear '' in the wavefunction downstream of the flux tube .",
    "the incident plane wave is cut in two by the flux tube and , apart from diffraction effects , the upper and lower halves of the incident wave propagate parallel to each other but with a relative phase shift of a fraction @xmath29 of a wavelength .",
    "it is in the region of the seam that the transverse momentum imparted to the beam by the flux resides . indeed in fig [ fig : bohm.25 ] one can plainly see that the wavefronts are directed slightly upwards in this region .",

    "the total transverse momentum per unit length at abscissa @xmath40 is therefore = 12 _ ( 0 ) |_0|^2 ( x ) , where @xmath41 , the phase difference across the seam , is zero long before the sound wave interacts with the vortex , and ( x ) = 2= well after the sound waves have passed the vortex . in this manner",
    "the transverse momentum is found by examining the wave at large ( but not infinite ) impact parameter , and the result is insensitive to details such as diffraction effects .    the transverse momentum per unit length of the seam can also be written ( 12 _ ( 0 ) |_0|^2 k ) 1 k= 1 k , where @xmath42 is the mass current , or momentum density in the unperturbed sound wave . if a finite pulse of sound is sent past the vortex then a length of seam equal to the group velocity of the waves ( here @xmath23 ) is created every second .",
    "the transverse force is the rate of creation of transverse momentum and this is = 1 k c = [ eq : statvforce ] in agreement with ref @xcite .",
    "the mass flux due to phonons in the two fluid model is = _",

    "this expression is continuous across the negative @xmath40 axis , but jumps discontinuously by @xmath4 across the positive @xmath40 axis .",
    "we therefore find that the eikonal phase has the expected @xmath53 discontinuity across the seam .",
    "the physical wave fronts , of course , smoothly interpolate the phase across the seam .",
    "we immediately see that outside this interpolating zone , in the region where the eikonal approximation to the phase is valid , we have _",
    "y + kc ( v_v)_y=0 .",
    "this means that @xmath54 is zero outside the seam region .",
    "thus the flux of @xmath55 through any curve vanishes unless it intersects the seam .",
    "indeed we find that the only regions that have a net transverse momentum flux out of them are those that include the vortex .",
    "for these the momentum flux is entirely due to the interpolating phase and comes out to be @xmath56 as found by the previous , more intuitive , method .",
    "the transverse momentum flux tensor vanishes because the transverse component of @xmath57 acquired by interaction with the flow is cancelled by the transverse component of @xmath46 when they are combined to form the group velocity = ck * k * + _ v. the classical phonon trajectories therefore remain straight , and , just as in the ordinary bohm - aharonov effect , the transverse momentum is consequence of the wave - particle duality .",
    "a more detailed analysis would take into account the reduction of the amplitude of the sound wave in the seam region .",
    "it is well understood from the theory of bohm - aharovov scattering@xcite that the effect of this is to replace @xmath58 by @xmath59 in the force equation .",
    "( inspection of fig [ fig : bohm.5 ] where @xmath60 shows that that the sound wave amplitude is exactly zero in the seam ) . using @xmath61 for the speed of sound in liquid helium , we find = = 0.035 e_phon where @xmath62 is the energy of the phonon measured in degrees kelvin .",
    "we see that @xmath58 is small at temperatures below @xmath63k where phonons dominate the scattering process , so the correction will be unimportant .",
    "so far we have merely reproduced the results of @xcite .",
    "we now extend our analysis to the case in which the vortex moves with respect to the condensate .",
    "so as to retain a time independent equation we will keep the vortex fixed at the origin , but allow a non - zero asymptotic @xmath2 . for simplicity of description",
    "we will initially consider only the case where the uniform @xmath2 is in the direction of propagation of the sound wave , which as before we take to be the @xmath64 direction .",
    "we will write @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the length of seam created per second is @xmath66 .",
    "we need to find the phase shift between two halves of the wavefront to complete the computation .",
    "it is tempting to simply replace the @xmath46 in ( [ eq : bohm - aharonov ] ) by @xmath67 , but this will not serve to give the correct answer . because of the doppler shift , the frequency is now related to the wavelength by @xmath68 , so for a wave with the same @xmath69 the frequency , and hence the effective flux = _ vd*r * is increased , and this makes the phase shift larger .",
    "this is not what we expect , and is incorrect .",
    "the terms added to the sound - wave equation to make it into the minimally coupled schrdinger equation are no longer harmless .",
    "this is because even when we work only to @xmath70 accuracy , we must not neglect @xmath71 terms .",
    "we require a more accurate equation . in the appendix",
    "we show that the relevent equation is that given by unruh @xcite ( + ) ( + ) = ( ) , who interprets his equation as that of a scalar field propagating in a curved space - time background .",
    "we can find the phase offset by working at large impact parameter where @xmath21 is essentially independent of @xmath39 , and where also @xmath72 is negligeable .",
    "we can therefore set = ( x)e^ikx - it with @xmath73 , and expect @xmath74 to be slowly varying .",
    "the equation for @xmath21 becomes -^2 -2iv_x _ x + v_x^2 ^2_xx= c^2 ^ 2_xx[eq : onedimapprox ] where @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath76 is slowly varying we can ignore @xmath77 .",
    "doing so we find that ( [ eq : onedimapprox ] ) reduces to ( v_v)_x k - i(u+c)_x=0 .",
    "( i have ignored terms containing @xmath78 in the coefficient of @xmath79 because they will not affect our result to @xmath80 . )",
    "this gives ( x)=e^-i(x ) with ( x ) = ku+c ^x_- ( v_v)_x dx. we see that as @xmath81 the phase offset of the two wavefronts becomes = ku+c _ v d*r*= ku+c .",
    "the factor of @xmath82 cancels against the length of seam being created per second to give = as before .",
    "this result can be confirmed by examining the momentum flux tensor .",
    "the @xmath83 part of @xmath54 is now _",
    "xy= ( ( c+u)1k _ y + ( v_v)_y ) , where we have included a non - zero contribution from @xmath84 .",
    "once again we see that outside the seam region the gradient of @xmath49 cancels the @xmath85 advective term , and that the discontinuity across the seam provides the momentum flux obtained in the previous paragraph .",
    "the wavefront offset can also be calculated from the time delay between phonons passing on other side of the vortex .",
    "since the phonon trajectories with large impact parameters are hardly deflected , we can find them as the null geodesics of the simplified form of the unruh metric ( [ eq : unruh_simplified ] ) ds^2=c \\{-(dx-(v+c)dt)(dx-(v - c)dt)-dy^2-dz^2}. the null geodesics are given by = vc . in our present case ,",
    "the time of arrival of a signal at the point @xmath51 is t(x , y ) = ^(x , y)_- = const.- 1(u+c)^2 ^(x , y)_- ( v_v)_x dx + o(v_v^2 ) .",
    "we convert the time delay to a phase shift by multiplying by @xmath86 .",
    "again we find that the relative phase shift between waves that pass above and below the vortex to be = ku+c . as described by volovik @xcite this separation in the time of arrival for signals passing abitrarily far from the vortex is characteristic of a `` spinning cosmic string '' .",
    "matters become slightly more complicated when the uniform background superflow @xmath2 is not oriented parallel ( or anti - parallel ) to the incident phonon flux . after a little work we find that the eikonal equation becomes ( * u*^g ) + * k*_v=0 , where @xmath87 .",
    "the phase discontinuity seam no longer lies exactly along the @xmath40 axis , but instead points in the direction of @xmath88 .",
    "the rate of transverse momentum production does depend on the angle this vector makes with the x axis , but the effects are @xmath89 .",
    "they do not seem to be worth working out in detail since at this order we should also include compressibility effects and the dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath10 on @xmath90 .",
    "we have computed the force on a vortex due to the scattering of phonons in the case where the vortex is moving with respect to the condensate .",
    "we have shown that to first order in @xmath91 the rate of transverse momentum production is independent of the relative velocity of the vortex and the condensate , and that the bohm - aharonov phase shift of the phonon wavefront passing on either side of the vortex leads to a force _ phon=_n ( _ s-_n ) , which is consistent with galilean invariance .",
    "this supports the view that the bohm - aharonov analysis of the phonon force is correct .",
    "the expression we have obtained for the phonon force leads to the commonly accepted form of the iordanskii force and so disagrees with the claims of thouless _",
    "_ that it vanishes identically .",
    "their claim is based on earlier work by thouless , ao and niu ( tan)@xcite which establishes a general theorem relating the force on a vortex to the circulation of momentum at infinity .",
    "since there are no impurities present , this theorem should hold here and we have a puzzle that needs to be resolved .    in response to criticism of their claims@xcite , thouless _",
    "et al._@xcite have given two possible explanations for the discrepancy .",
    "the first suggests that the computation of the cross section asymmetry is mathematically flawed because a conditionally convergent series is mistreated .",
    "if this were correct , their objection would also apply to the case where @xmath92 , but we have shown here that the scattering asymmetry correctly predicts the reduction of the coefficient of @xmath2 from @xmath7 to @xmath10 .",
    "this explanation seems unlikely therefore .",
    "the second possible explanation is more subtle . in the calculations presented here , and in all earlier work on phonon scattering ,",
    "the incident flux of phonons is calculated by assuming a thermal phonon distribution derived from the asymptotic @xmath3 and @xmath2 , _ i.e. _ a distribution that does not seem to take into account the effect of the local vortex flow field @xmath46 .",
    "because the assumed phonon flux to the left and right of the vortex is the same , it appears that the phonons make an equal reduction in the fluid momentum on either side of the vortex . in other words",
    "they appear not to change the value of the total momentum circulation k_tot = d*r * , so that it remains @xmath93 instead of being reduced to @xmath94 .",
    "if this were correct there would be circulation in the normal fluid as well as in the superfluid component .",
    "if we include this unphysical circulation in the tan formula , then it agrees with the calculated iordanskii force .",
    "the problem with this explanantion is that the motion of the phonons can be derived from a hamiltonian , @xmath95 .",
    "consequently liouville s theorem applies to the distribution function . even in the absence of phonon - phonon interactions ,",
    "a phonon distribution function that is in thermal equilibrium will remain in equilibrium and so phonons arriving from infinity will have their local distribution modified by the flow field so as to correctly bring about the expected reduction in the circulation .",
    "although there are an equal number number of phonons passing to the right or to the left of the vortex , those moving against the superflow are going slower , so their _ number density _ is higher .",
    "this means that the phonon momentum opposing the @xmath96 _ is _ left - right asymmetric as it should be .",
    "there remains a contradiction , therefore .",
    "what are we to conclude ?",
    "the tan arguments implicitly make use of the change in the total momentum of the medium outside the vortex . in fluid mechanics",
    "it is well known that the total momentum associated with a system of vortices is ill - defined , being given by a conditionally convergent integral .",
    "this problem is usually dealt with defining the _",
    "impulse_@xcite of the vortex system .",
    "the impulse is defined in terms the velocity potential in the vicinity of the vortex system , and does not have contributions from the effects of distant boundaries ( the ultimate origin of the ill - defined momentum ) .",
    "perhaps this is at the root of the problem . on the other hand",
    "the present calculation might be also described as nave .",
    "we are not distinguishing between the true newtonian momentum and the _ pseudo - momentum_@xcite possessed by the phonons .",
    "however pseudo - momentum is usually exactly what is needed for computing forces on immersed objects .",
    "clearly , more work is needed to resolve the paradox .",
    "this work was supported by grant nsf - dmr-98 - 17941 .",
    "i would like to thank edouard sonin and andrei shelankov for useful e - mail discussions and also david thouless , ping ao and imon kos for many useful conversations .",
