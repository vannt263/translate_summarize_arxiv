    "note that since the operator @xmath46 is a two - body operator , i.e. it only changes the occupation numbers of two single - electron states , the trielectronic process can not be described by first - order perturbation theory , @xmath47    equation  ( [ eq : tr - pert ] ) also expresses the symmetry requirement that a tr autoionizing state can only be populated with noticeable probability if there is a dr state of the same total angular momentum and parity ( i.e. the matrix element in the numerator is non - zero ) and it is close in energy ( i.e. the denominator is not too large as compared to the numerator ) .",

    ".    the tr cross section may nevertheless be sizable due to the mixing of the initial ( ground ) state of the ion with excited - state configurations : since in the description of the , e.g. , be - like initial state configurations of the type @xmath52 are present , the transition from such a state to a tr configuration @xmath53 is possible by a single coulomb interaction , giving rise to significant tr peaks  @xcite .",

    ", this fraction may approach unity since the electron interaction operator @xmath46 acts on the strongly overlapping tr and dr state functions , and the interaction energy in the numerator lies close to the @xmath54 splitting .",
    "the tr capture rates may thus become comparable to the dr capture rates .",
    "because of this , it is necessary to treat the trielectronic process non - perturbatively : the autoionizing state formed by the trielectronic process is described as the linear combination @xmath55 and the autoionizing state populated by dielectronic capture is represented as @xmath56 the expansion coefficients may be obtained by diagonalizing the total hamiltonian of the system in a configuration interaction approach or by the mcdf method .    note that in equations ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , the first configuration is not necessarily the dominant one ; this holds only true in the high-@xmath1 limit where the @xmath57-coupling scheme is applicable",

    "we find that , since a state such as ( [ eq6 ] ) contains two electronic holes , one in the @xmath0 shell and one in the @xmath4 shell , which may both decay separately by photon emission , the process leading to its population can indeed be termed as trielectronic recombination .",

    "one can state for the tr / dr strength ratio an excellent agreement between our experimental findings and our calculations .",
    "this is not only true for the @xmath1-dependence of the strength ratio , but holds also for the dependence on the ionic sequence . in the bottom panel of fig  [ tr / dr - strength ]",
    "we display for li- to n - like fe ions the corresponding strength ratio tr / dr including also the ratio qr / dr .    for fe ions , the nuclear charge",
    "@xmath1 is low enough to show sizable contributions of higher - order resonances and high enough to ensure a good resolution of the resonance spectrum .",
    "the qr / dr strength ratio seems also be confirmed within the experimental uncertainty by the calculations . although the statistics for qr are insufficient for a precise determination of resonance energies , the spectrum shown in figs .",
    "[ fe - kll ] and [ ar_fe_kr_blowup ] shows an obvious indication of qr resonances .",
    "our calculations and the experimental findings agree convincingly well ( see the correspondingly marked resonance in fig .  [ fe - kll ] ) .",
    "the faint structures seen around an electron energy of 4.980kev correspond thus to qr in both c- and be - like fe ions .",
    "an approximate scaling law for qr may be derived in an analogous manner to that found for tr , using similar considerations for the four - electron auger rate ( @xmath94 ) : @xmath95 here , we have taken into account that autoionizing states formed by quadruelectronic capture may decay by two- , three- or four - electron auger processes .",
    "the qr resonance strength diminishes for high @xmath1 even faster than the strength of tr , namely , as @xmath96 .",
    "however , its experimental signatures have become measurable , and a systematic study of the interesting isoelectronic sequences as a function of @xmath1 could provide better insight into the complex mutual interactions of same - shell electrons , beyond what is possible by studying the single neutrals giving name to those sequences .",
    "unexpected large contributions of higher - order electronic recombination processes have been found for inter - shell @xmath0-@xmath4 excitation . for these processes ,",
    "high momenta are exchanged during recombination and hence , large contributions from higher orders are generally not expected .",
    "as shown , the second - order resonant electron recombination process , tr , may even overwhelm the strength of the first - order dr process , as observed in the case of c - like ar , cf .",
    "fig .  [ tr / dr - strength ] . in most cases",
    ", the second - order tr process contributes about 10% to the total electronic recombination cross section , and its relative contribution decreases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "even the third - order process , qr , was clearly identified , contributing typically a few % of dr .",
    "these novel findings on the importance of higher - order processes in resonant inter - shell electronic recombination were made possible by enhanced energy resolution and good experimental statistics , both points being achieved by evaporative axial cooling of the trapped ions .    beyond the obvious @xmath1 trends seen in the resonance energies and caused by the balance between electron correlation and relativistic effects ,",
    "strikingly apparent higher - order electron - electron correlation effects are found at lower atomic numbers . here",
    ", the strength of higher - order recombination processes can surpass that of the corresponding first - order dr process  @xcite .",
    "since the _ inter - shell _ @xmath0-@xmath3 photorecombination process is a far more efficient cooling mechanism in high - temperature plasmas than _ intra - shell _ processes , due to the much higher energy of the emitted photons , a good knowledge of its energy - dependent cross section is essential .",
    "therefore , hitherto neglected contributions from higher - order effects to electron recombination , and especially of the second - order , the trielectronic channel , have to be taken into account .",
    "plasma simulations used for modeling fusion devices or astrophysical matter have to include them for improved accuracy .",
    "the presence of sizable tr resonances has implications for the opacity and energy transfer inside the radiative zone of stars , and for the temperature and ionization equilibrium of those and other astrophysical plasmas .",
    "models not considering these higher - order effects in plasmas containing light-@xmath1 species can therefore not describe correctly the status in a plasma .",
    "moreover , for the time - reversed processes of resonant photoionization  @xcite , i.  e. , the resonant excitation to an autoionizing intermediate state , also those higher - order processes may be of equal importance .",
    "even beyond tr , quadruelectronic recombination has been observed for different ionic species .",
    "studying photorecombination in all orders of complexity , from dr to tr and qr , can become a fruitful approach for understanding more complex multi - electron processes such as shake - up and shake - off in outer shells , especially for heavier species  @xcite . arguably , even higher recombination orders involving more than four simultaneous electronic excitations , which are more likely to be expected in recombination of open @xmath97-shell ions having many equivalent electrons and vacancies energetically closely spaced , should be investigated to learn about the stepwise buildup of a many - electron wave function . the role of relativistic corrections to the coulomb electron interaction ,",
    "i.e. , the breit interaction  @xcite , in such higher - order processes is also an unexplored field . with the ion charge as a variable parameter and a constant number of electrons , isoelectronic sequences in highly charged ions",
    "are perfectly suited for this type of investigations .",
    "furthermore , such a multi - electron behavior may also be manifested in resonant processes occurring due to the presence of neighboring atoms or ions in dense plasmas or molecules @xcite ."
