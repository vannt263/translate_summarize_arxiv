    "next we explain briefly , using a toy example , the reason for the non - convergence of @xmath52 and the convergence of subsequences in theorems [ non - conve ] and [ subsequ ] .",

    "@xcite ) , that for @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , the distributions of @xmath110 ( see theorem [ sum_iid ] for a more general result ) . but obviously here @xmath111 can not converge in law , if @xmath112 , because one easily checks that the distribution of @xmath113 does not belong to the domain of attraction of any stable law .",
    "this is the basis of our belief that theorem [ non - conve ] should be valid for any @xmath102 .",
    "we now discuss the motivation for this work .",
    "if one considers a biased random walk on a supercritical percolation cluster on @xmath114 , it is known that , at low bias , the random walk is ballistic ( i.e. has a positive velocity ) and has gaussian fluctuations , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that , at strong bias , the random walk is subballistic ( i.e. the velocity vanishes ) . it should be noted that , in contrast to the galton - watson tree , the existence of a critical value separating the two regimes is not established for supercritical percolation clusters .",
    "the behaviour of the ( law of ) the random walk in the subballistic regime is a very interesting open problem .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that the behaviour of the random walk in this regime is reminiscent of trap models introduced by bouchaud ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our work indeed substantiates this analogy in the simpler case of supercritical random trees .",
    "we show that most of the time spent by the random walk before reaching level @xmath6 is spent in deep traps .",
    "these trapping times are roughly independent and are heavy - tailed .",
    "however , their distribution does not belong to the domain of attraction of a stable law , which explains the non - convergence result in theorem [ non - conve ] .",
    "we note that it is possible to obtain convergence results to stable laws if one gets rid of the inherent lattice structure .",
    "one way to do this is to randomize the bias @xmath2 .",
    "this is the approach of the forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "for other recent interesting works about random walks on trees , we refer to  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "there is also an analogy with the one - dimensional random walk in an i.i.d .",
    "random environment ( rwre ) .",
    "this model also shows a ballistic and a subballistic regime , explicitly known in terms of the parameters of the model .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a survey . in the subballistic regime",
    ", it was shown in  @xcite that depending on a certain parameter @xmath115 $ ] , and under a non - lattice assumption , @xmath116 converges to a functional of a stable law , if @xmath117 , and @xmath118 converges to a functional of a stable law , if @xmath119 .",
    "recently , using a precise description of the environment , @xcite and  @xcite refined this last theorem by describing all the parameters of the stable law , in the case @xmath120 .",
    "our method has some similarity to the one used in  @xcite . in comparison to  @xcite",
    ", an additional difficulty arises from the fact the traps met depend not only on the environment but also on the walk .",
    "moreover one has to take into account the number of times the walker enters a trap , which is a complicated matter because of the inhomogeneity of the tree .",
    "this major technical difficulty can be overcome by decomposing the tree and the walk into independent parts , which we do using a new variant of regeneration times .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sectionconstruction ] and section  [ trapcons ] we explain how to decompose the tree and the walk . in section  [ sketch ]",
    "we give a sketch of the proof of theorem [ subsequ ] .",
    "sections [ onlybig ] - [ sectiontail ] prepare the proof of theorem [ subsequ ] and explain why the hitting time of level @xmath6 is comparable to a sum of i.i.d .  random variables .",
    "section [ sect_sum_iid ] is self - contained and its main result , theorem [ sum_iid ] , is a classical limit theorem for sums of i.i.d .",
    "random variables which is tailored for our situation . in section",

    "[ subseq ] , we apply theorem [ sum_iid ] to prove theorem [ subsequ ] .",
    "subsection [ non - conv ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ non - conve ] , subsection [ magnit ] gives the proof of theorem [ tightness ] and subsection [ limprop ] the proof of theorem [ infdivprop ] .",
    "let us give some conventions about notations .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath121 will remain fixed so we will usually not point out that constants depend on them . most constants will be denoted @xmath122 or @xmath123 and their value may change from line to line to ease notations .",
