    "here we develop a technique for constructing a solution to a differential equation with a robin ( generalized neumann ) boundary condition when a solution to the same or a related equation with the dirichlet boundary condition is available .",
    "the idea is surely not new .",
    "( in fact , our key formula ( [ rt ] ) for the heat equation was published in 1891 @xcite , and tikhonov and samarsky @xcite indicate how to solve the wave equation on the half - line by a method related to ours . in both cases",
    "the initial heuristic motivation is somewhat different from ours , but the resulting calculus is the same . ) but we believe that it has not heretofore been systematically developed and exploited .",
    "we are primarily interested in the integral kernels ( green functions ) that solve the wave , heat , schrdinger ,   equations associated with a given self - adjoint ( usually positive ) differential operator , say  @xmath0 , in the spatial variables .",
    "these functions are useful not only to solve the partial differential equation concerned , but also to obtain information about the spectrum and eigenfunctions of  @xmath0 . in particular , semiclassical approximation ( or classical - quantum duality @xcite ) relates the eigenvalues of  @xmath0 ( collectively ) to the periodic orbits of the classical system whose quantum hamiltonian is @xmath0 ( or of the geometrical optics of the wave equation of  @xmath0 ) .    in the simplest cases ( the laplacian operator with zero - dimensional or at least flat boundaries ) exact solutions of the robin problems can be found .",
    "these kernels manifest a certain nonlocal behavior in the time variable , which is reflected in the more familiar eigenfunctions and frequency - domain green functions by a nonpolynomial dependence of the reflection coefficients on frequency ( @xmath1 in ( [ eig ] ) , for example ) .",
    "this property makes it difficult to solve the time - dependent problems by simple matching at the boundary  hence the utility of the dirichlet - to - robin transform technique .",
    "the phenomenon of time delay at the boundary can be understood physically by observing @xcite that in a wave equation the robin condition models an _ elastic support _ at the boundary ; in other words , in one dimension a vibrating string is attached at one endpoint to a discrete , massless spring with hooke constant  @xmath2 .",
    "the string can exchange energy with the spring ; this explains the surface energy and action associated with robin boundaries in quantum field theory @xcite and also the possibility of delayed reflection of a physical impulse .    after setting up the general formalism of the method in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] , in sec .",
    "[ sec : elem ] we construct the green functions for a variety of time - dependent problems on the half - line .",
    "for the heat and schrdinger equations the extension to a higher - dimensional flat boundary is easy , and the analysis leads to a ( possibly new ) determination of the heat - kernel coefficient ( e.g. , @xcite ) associated with @xmath3 for any  @xmath4 .",
    "[ sec : adv ] discusses the hopes for extending the method to less elementary models , where only approximate solutions can be expected .",
    "[ sec : interval ] treats the wave equation on an interval with one robin endpoint ; therefrom , the eigenvalues and the local spectral density are recovered from sums over the periodic and closed orbits of the problem . in fact , we stress that there are quite a few different ways of arriving at such sums and it is not always obvious that the results are the same .",
    "most notably , because the series are not absolutely convergent , their behavior is sensitive to reordering of the terms ; we show , however , that this problem is significant in practice only at very small frequencies and amounts in principle to a delta - function ambiguity at zero frequency ( see appendix  [ app : delta ] ) .",
    "this observation probably has implications for more general problems .",
    "apart from that phenomenon , we demonstrate agreement among several variants of the periodic - orbit expansion .",

    ", @xmath13 is the physically more plausible case .",
    "( in a heat conduction problem , for example , @xmath14 represents heat flow from a colder medium to a hotter one . ) when @xmath13 all the operators studied in the present paper have nonnegative spectrum .",
    "@xcite we use @xmath15 to stand for `` irrelevant transverse dimensions '' although the notation @xmath16 ( for `` dimensions parallel to the boundary '' ) would be equally logical .",
    "3 .   in this paper",
    "we find it convenient to use @xmath17 as a generic notation for all green functions , rather than introduce separate letters for heat kernels , wave propagators , etc .",
    "the meaning of @xmath17 is stable within each subsection .",
    "when a dirac delta function appears at an endpoint of an interval of integration , its interpretation is ambiguous by a factor  @xmath18 .",
    "we adopt the convention that the density of ( nonnegative ) eigenvalues , @xmath19 , with respect to integration over the eigenfrequency @xmath20 , is ( ) = _ k=1^(-_k ) [ rhodef ] _ even when @xmath21 is an eigenvalue_. the reader may note ( especially in sec .",
    "[ ssec : neum ] ) some factors @xmath18 that are not fully explained but are clearly necessary to produce the right answer .",
    "a rigorous treatment of such issues may appear elsewhere @xcite .",

    "suppose , for example , that @xmath68 is to satisfy the heat equation with initial data @xmath69 . the part of the solution proportional to @xmath70 can be written down immediately as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the orthogonal projection onto  @xmath67",
