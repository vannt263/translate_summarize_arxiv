    "this paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of the new type of the undulator radiation ( acoustically induced radiation ",
    "air ) generated by an ultra - relativistic charged particle channeling along a crystal plane , which is periodically bent by a transverse acoustic wave ( aw ) , as well as to the conditions limiting the observation of this phenomenon .",
    "this mechanism , suggested recently in @xcite , makes feasible the generation of electromagnetic radiation , both spontaneous and stimulated , emitted in a wide range of the photon energies , from @xmath0- up to @xmath1-rays .",
    "the mechanism of the air generation is illustrated in . under the action of a transverse acoustic wave propagating along the @xmath2-direction , which defines the center line of an initially straight channel ( not plotted in the figure )",
    "the channel becomes periodically bent .",
    "provided certain conditions are fulfilled ( see below in this section and in ) , the beam of positrons , which enters the crystal at a small incident angle with respect to the curved crystallographic plane , will penetrate through the crystal following the bendings of its channel .",
    "it results in the transverse oscillations of the beam particles while travelling along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "these oscillations become an effective source of spontaneous radiation of undulator type due to the constructive interference of the photons emitted from similar parts of the trajectory . as we demonstrate below",
    ", the number of oscillations can vary in a wide range from a few up to a few thousands per @xmath3 depending on the the beam energy , the aw amplitude , @xmath4 , and wavelength , @xmath5 , the type of the crystal and the crystallographic plane .",
    "in addition to the spontaneous photon emission by the undulator , the scheme presented in leads to a possibility to generate stimulated emission .",
    "this is due to the fact , that photons , emitted at the points of the maximum curvature of the trajectory , travel almost parallel to the beam and , thus , stimulate the photon generation in the vicinity of all successive maxima and minima of the trajectory .",
    "some aspects of the electromagnetic radiation by a beam of charged particles channeling in a crystal undergoing the action of an ultrasonic wave have been discussed in the literature @xcite@xcite .",
    "we shall mention the main results obtained in the cited papers and outline the features , both of formal and of principal nature , which distinguish the air radiation described above from the effects considered in @xcite@xcite at the end of this section .",
    "prior to that let us briefly discuss the phenomena closely related to the mechanism of generating the acoustically induced radiation .",
    "these are the channeling effect , the channeling radiation and the undulator radiation .",
    "the basic effect of the channeling process in a straight crystal is that a charged particle can penetrate an anomalously large distance inside a crystal if travelling nearly parallel to the crystallographic plane or axis and experiencing the collective action of the electric field of the lattice ions .",
    "positively charged particles are steered into the interatomic region ( the planar channeling ) while negatively charged projectiles move in vicinity of the ionic chains ( the axial channeling ) .",
    "channeling was discovered in the early 1960s by computer simulations of ion motion in crystals @xcite .",
    "large penetration lengths were obtained for ions incident along crystallographic directions of low indexes .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a guided motion had already been predicted @xcite by stark in 1912 @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive theoretical study @xcite introduced the important continuum approximation for the interaction potentials between energetic charged projectiles and lattice atoms arranged in atomic strings and planes .",
    "these concepts were subsequently widely used in the interpretation of channeling experiments ( see e.g. the review article @xcite ) . during recent years",
    "particular attention has been paid to studying of the channeling phenomenon at high energies of the particles @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of bending the high - energy beams of charged particles , proposed in @xcite , has become of great current interest @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite because of its practical application for the manipulation of the beams .",
    "indeed , the high - energy beams can be bent by crystals as efficiently as by means of external electric or magnetic fields .",
    "the size of such crystals is typically hundreds times smaller than the size of the equivalent magnet . in recent experiments with 450",
    "gev protons @xcite the efficiency of the particle beam deflection was reported on the level of 60% .",
    "another possible application of bent crystal was suggested in @xcite , where the question whether the channeling effect can also be used to focus beams , especially heavy - ion beams , was discussed . to this end",
    "a crystal is needed in which the crystal axes are no longer parallel , but are slanted more and more the farther away they are from the axis of the beam .",
    "then the bending angle of the particles far away from the beam axis would be largest and a general focusing effect will result .",
    "such a crystal can in principle be produced by varying the germanium to silicon ratio in a mixed crystal @xcite .",
    "the criterion for a stable channeling of an ultra - relativistic particle in a bent crystal was formulated in @xcite and has clear physical meaning : the maximum centrifugal force due to the channel bending must be less than that of the interplanar field . provided this condition is fulfilled , the beam of ( positively charged ) channeling particles at each instant moves inside the channel , especially parallel to the bent crystal midplane as it does in the case of linear channeling .",
    "two realistic ways of `` preparation '' of a periodically bent channel may be discussed .",
    "it is feasible , by means of mordern technology @xcite , to grow the crystal with its channels been statically bent according to a particular pattern .",
    "the channeling phenomenon has been also considered in the periodic structures such as superlattices @xcite .",
    "the possibility @xcite , @xcite - @xcite , of a dynamically bent crystal , arises if one considers propagation of an acoustic wave along some particular direction in a crystal as shown in . under the action of the aw the crystal channels , being linear initially",
    ", will be periodically bent .",
    "in both cases the passage of an ultra - relativistic particle along the bent channel gives rise to the air phenomenon due to the curvature of the trajectory , provided that the projectile is trapped into the channel .",
    "the latter condition is subject to the general criterion for the channeling process in a bent crystal @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and can be fulfilled by a proper choice of projectile energy and maximal curvature of the channel , as described below in the paper .",
    "the advantage of the static channel is that its parameters are fixed and , thus , the projectile moves along the fixed trajectory as well . to calculate the characteristics of the emitted radiation one needs to know only the number of the periods and the local cuvature radius .",
    "the disadvantage is that when fixing the number of periods then the parameters of the system can be varied only by changing the energy of the particle .",
    "this makes the photon generation less tunable .",
    "the motion of a particle in the field of the channel bent by transverse aw becomes periodic and , therefore , the spectrum of radiation emitted by a projectile acquires essential features of the undulator radiation .",
    "it is natural that the air emission is accompanied by the ordinary channeling radiation @xcite .",
    "this specific type of electromagnetic radiation arises due to the transverse motion of the channeling particle inside the channel under the action of the interplanar field .",
    "the phenomena of the channeling radiation of a charged projectile in a linear crystal ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) as well as in a `` simple '' ( i.e. non - periodically ) bent channel @xcite , are known , although in the latter case the theoretical and experimental data are scarce , at least up to now .",
    "we demonstrate in our paper that the air and the ordinary channeling radiation can be separated provided the condition @xmath6 is fulfilled ( see ) .",
    "then the frequency of the particle oscillations inside the channel is much higher than the frequency of the transverse oscillations caused by the aw .",
    "therefore , these two motions are well separated and the air mechanism can be treated independently from the ordinary channeling radiation .",
    "we shall discuss this important issue in more detail in . here",
    "let us only note that a similar situation occurs in a one - arc bent crystal , where the channeling charged particle generates additional synchrotron type radiation due to the curvature of the channel @xcite .",
    "this component of the total radiation intensity leads to the undulator effect in the channel periodically bent by aw .",
    "we will show that the intensity of air can be made larger than that of the channeling radiation .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite , the system `` ultra - relativistic charged particle + periodically bent crystal channel '' represents by itself a new type of undulator , and , consequently , serves as a new source of undulator radiation of high intensity , monochromaticity and with a particular pattern of the angular - frequency distribution .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation in this undulator arises mainly due to the bending of the particle trajectory which follows the shape of the channel .",
    "the parameters of this undulator , as well as the characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation , depend on the type of the crystal and on the crystallographic plane , on the type of projectile and its energy ; they also depend on the shape of the bent channel , and , thus , can be varied significantly by varying the enlisted characteristics .",
    "the theory and also the various practical implementations of the undulator radiation , e.g. the radiation emitted by a charge moving in spatially periodic static magnetic fields ( a magnetic undulator ) , in a laser field ( a laser - based undulator ) , etc . have a long history @xcite and",
    "are well elaborated @xcite .",
    "it is also known @xcite that a positively charged ultra - relativistic particle , undergoing a planar channeling in a linear crystal , radiates electromagnetic waves whose spectral and angular distributions are those of the undulator ( a natural undulator ) due to the transverse oscillations caused by the action of the repulsive interplanar potential .",
    "also the characteristics of the radiation emitted in a natural undulator are very sensitive to the distribution of the particles in the beam over the transverse energy and the incident angle .",
    "the important feature of the dynamically bent crystal by means of an aw is that it allows to consider an undulator with the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( here @xmath7 is the number of periods in the undulator and @xmath9 is its parameter ( see ) , and @xmath1 is the relativistic factor ) varying over a wide range , which is determined not only by the projectile s energy but also by the aw frequency and amplitude .",
    "the latter two quantities can easily be tuned resulting in the possibility of significantly varying the intensity and shape of the angular distribution of the radiation .",
    "it is important to note that the parameters of the acoustically based undulator are inaccessible in the undulators based on the motion of charged particles in periodic magnetic fields and also in the field of laser radiation @xcite .    in the suggested scheme air",
    "is generated by the relativistic charged particles , with relativistic factors @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the velocity of light , @xmath12 is the mass of the particle and @xmath13 is its energy ) .",
    "the large range of @xmath1 available in modern colliders for various charged particles , both light and heavy , together with the wide range of frequencies and the amplitudes possible for aw in crystals allow to generate air photons with the energies up into the gev region @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the specific pattern of the undulator radiation combined with the air mechanism allows to discuss the possibility to create a powerful source of stimulated monochromatic radiation of high - energy photons .",
    "we analyse this important possibility in more detail in the present article .",
    "particular attention is paid to the investigation of the influence of various physical processes , such as the photon attenuation and the dechanneling effect of positrons in crystals , both leading to a reduction in the amplification of the stimulated photon emission .",
    "let us briefly outline here the assumptions , which are adopted in this paper and formulate the main conditions which allow to consider the aw bent crystal as an undulator .",
    "although the general treatment of both the undulator radiation ( ) and the channeling process in the aw bent crystal ( ) can be applied to axial and a planar channeling , we consider the latter case because it is known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that for bent crystals negatively charged projectiles are steered along crystallographic axes much less efficiently than positively charged ones along the crystal planes .",
    "in fact , experimentally the axial channeling of negative particles has not been observed so far .",
    "two important conditions which we assume to be fulfilled are the following :    1 .",
    "the bending of the channel becomes significant if the aw amplitude is noticeably larger than the interplanar spacing , @xmath14 ( see ) .",
    "thus , the strong inequality @xmath15 is implied throughout the paper . typically , the spacing between the planes , which are characterized by the low values of the miller indices ( such as the ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) planes ) , lies within the range @xmath16 (see e.g. @xcite and in ) below .",
    "therefore , is fulfilled for the aw amplitudes @xmath17  .",
    "the channeling process in a bent crystal takes place if the maximal centrifugal force in the channel , @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is a minimum curvature radius of the bent channel ) is less than the maximal force due to the interplanar field @xcite : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the charge of the projectile and the quantity @xmath22 stands for the maximum gradient of the interplanar field .",
    "provided is fulfilled , the projectile , incident at small angle with respect to the mid - plane , will be trapped in the channel ( see ) .",
    "the condition allows to disregard the oscillations of the particle inside the channel due to the interplanar force @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the particle trajectory will be primarily harmonic defined by the equation @xmath24 \\label{aw_1}\\ ] ] here @xmath25 stands for the thickness of the crystal .",
    "the minimum curvature radius of this trajectory is equal to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the decrease in @xmath19 and , consequently , the increase in the maximum acceleration of the particle in the channel is achieved by decreasing @xmath5 and increasing @xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "photon emission due to the projectile s acceleration in the bent channel may be significantly enhanced .",
    "this radiation is emitted coherently from similar parts of the trajectory , and may dominate @xcite over the channeling radiation .",
    "an adequate approach to the problem of the radiation emission by an ultra - relativistic particle moving in an external field was developed by baier and katkov in the late 1960s @xcite and was called by the authors the `` operator quasi - classical method '' .",
    "the details of that formalism can be found in @xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it allows to use the classical trajectory for the particle in an external field and , simultaneously , it takes into account the effect of the radiative recoil .",
    "the classical description of the particle motion is valid provided the characteristic energy of the projectile in an external field , @xmath27 , is much less than its total energy , @xmath28 .",
    "the relation @xmath29 is fully applicable in the case of an ultra - relativistic projectile .",
    "typical values of @xmath30 are in the order of magnitude equal to the continuous potential - well depth , vary from several ev for the crystals of light materials ( e.q .",
    "the @xmath31 crystal @xcite ) up to @xmath32 ev for the crystals of heavy materials ( e.g. the @xmath33 crystal @xcite ) .",
    "the role of the radiative recoil , i.e. the change of the projectile energy due to photon emission , is governed by the ratio @xmath34 . in the limit @xmath35 a purely classical description @xcite of the radiative process can be used . for @xmath36 the quantum corrections due to the emission of the photon must be taken into account .",
    "the quasi - classical approach neglects the @xmath37 terms , but it explicitly takes into account the quantum corrections due to the radiative recoil in the whole range of the emitted photon energies , except for the extreme high energy tail of the spectrum .    using this method the spectra of photons and electron - positron pairs in linear crystals were successfully described @xcite .",
    "it was also applied to the problem of synchrotron - type radiation emitted by an ultra - relativistic projectile channeling in a non - periodically bent crystal @xcite .",
    "we use this general formalism of baier and katkov in our paper to treat the air phenomenon .    to conclude the introductory section",
    "let us discuss the results of the papers @xcite@xcite where the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a charge passing through a crystal undergoing the action of an ultrasonic wave was considered .",
    "as far as we are aware of , the first study of the influence of an external ultrasonic field on the radiation of channeling particles in a crystal was given in @xcite .",
    "in this article ( see also @xcite ) spontaneous emission by channeling particles in a silicon crystal bent by an acoustic wave of a frequency @xmath38 mhz was briefly considered .",
    "the estimates carried out in @xcite were based on the so - called dipole approximation for the undulator radiation ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the latter implies that the strong inequality , @xmath39 is valid , so that all the undulator emission occurs in the fundamental harmonic .",
    "such an assumption leads to a considerable narrowing of the parameters of the air radiation and , also , disregards the possibility to generate the emission in higher harmonics .    in papers",
    "@xcite the spontaneous channeling radiation in the presence of a _ low - amplitude _ ultrasonic wave was considered by means of classical electrodynamics . in this limit",
    "the aw amplitude is much less than the interplanar spacing , @xmath40 , resulting , thus , in low values of the curvatures of the acoustically bent channels .",
    "this inequality allowed the authors of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to consider the phenomenon of resonant enhancement of the photon yield due to the coupling of two mechnisms of the photon emission , the channeling radiation @xcite and that induced by the aw .    in @xcite",
    "both the spontaneous undulator emission and that of a free electron laser type was investigated in the case of a relativistic positron beam channeling through a periodically strained lattice . in this paper the main attention was paid to the radiation emitted in an undulator based on a solid state superlattice ( see also @xcite ) . by using the formalism of classical electrodynamics",
    "the authors of @xcite performed a self - consistent treatment involving the wave equation for the electromagnetic radiation field and the kinetic equation for the positron distribution function .",
    "the important result , which is the gain coefficient for the forward radiating field was obtained analytically in a closed form .",
    "numerical estimates of the gain in the case of a resonant coupling of the channeling radiation and that arising from the superlattice based undulator were presented .    in @xcite",
    "there is also a short comment on the possibility of using an acoustically bent crystall as an undulator . in our opinion ,",
    "the analogy between a superlattice and an acoustic wave can not be considered as adequate , because the acoustic wave amplitude , @xmath4 , can greatly exceed the interplanar distance @xmath14 , whereas in the superlattice based undulator the inverse condition is assumed , @xmath40 .",
    "this latter case was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it is stressed in and in that we consider here the opposite case @xmath41 . in this limit",
    "there is no resonant coupling between the channeling and the undulator radiation because the characteristic frequencies of the photons emitted via these mechanisms are totally incomparable ( see ) . as a result it is possible to distinguish two mechanisms of the radiation formation in an acoustically bent crystal and to investigate the properties of the air , both spontaneous and stimulated , separately from the channeling radiation .",
    "as we demonstrate below , staying within the regime defined by , it is possible , by tuning the aw amplitude or frequency , to vary significantly the intensity of the air radiation , to change the patterns of its spectral and angular distributions .",
    "these characteristics of the radiation , as it is known from the general theory of undulators ( e.g. @xcite ) , are crucially dependent on the magnitude of the undulator parameter @xmath8 . in our paper",
    "we provide the analysis of the air radiation for both limiting cases , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    in the case",
    "@xmath41 it is important to establish the conditions under which the acoustically bent crystal may serve as an undulator for the channeled ultra - relativistic particle . a comprehensive analysis of these conditions , and consequently",
    ", the establishment of the ranges of all parameters in the problem ( these are : the aw amplitude , frequency and velocity , the type of projectile and its energy , the width of the channel and the magnitude of the interplanar field ) inside which the air process is feasible , are studied in our paper .",
    "in contrast such a discussion is fully omitted in the papers cite above .",
    "another point we wish to emphasis is that the quasi - classical approach used in our paper is more appropriate than the purely classical treatment utilized in the cited papers . in our paper",
    "we consider the spectral distribution of the radiation in the whole range of the photon energies : @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear that the classical approach is valid only in the soft - photon limit , i.e. @xmath45 , but is totally inappropriate in the case @xmath46 where the quantum corrections ( the radiative recoil ) must be taken into account .",
    "the emission of high - energy photons becomes important for energies of projectile positrons in the tens gev range .    in our paper",
    "it is demonstrated , for the first time , that it is feasible to consider , by means of the air mechanism , stimulated emission within the @xmath47 mev range . to establish this interval we carried out a realistic analysis of the influence of the dechanneling and the photon attenuation effects on the spectrum of the air radiation .",
    "all the features mentioned above distinguish the results presented below from the earlier works @xcite-@xcite , @xcite .    finally , let us note that we do not consider the electromagnetic radiation @xcite arising during the projectile channeling in an ultrasonically excited crystal due to specific diffraction of the photons by sets of periodically bent planes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in the general formalism of the quasi - classical description of the undulator radiation is presented .",
    "is devoted to a detailed analysis of the conditions which allow to consider the acoustically bent crystal as an undulator .",
    "numerical results for the angular and spectral distributions of the undulator radiation as well as the energy loss due to the air are presented in for various crystals and projectile energies . in the estimates , both analytical and numerical , for the possibility to generate the stimulated emission by means of the acoustically based undulator are presented . in",
    "we outline the relevant problems which , to our mind , deserve to be thoroughly investigated .",
    "within the framework of the quasi - classical approach the distribution of the energy radiated in given direction by an ultra - relativistic particle ( of a spin @xmath48 ) and summed over the polarizations of the photon and the projectile , is given by the following expression @xmath49 here @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the unit vector in the direction of the photon emission , @xmath11 is the light velocity and @xmath21 is the projectile charge .",
    "the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined as follows @xmath54 the notations used are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 standing for projectile s radius vector and velocity , respectively .    expression ( [ wkb1 ] ) looks almost like the classical formula @xcite , although with quantum corrections : @xmath59 which take into account the radiative recoil .",
    "let us now obtain a general quasi - classical expression for the radiated energy , @xmath60 , in the case of a particle moving in an undulator which contains @xmath7 periods . the radius vector and the velocity of the particle in an undulator satisfy the conditions @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the time interval during which a projectile passes one period of the undulator , and the quantity @xmath63 @xmath64 is the mean velocity along the undulator axis .",
    "following @xcite and introducing the quantities @xmath65 expression ( [ wkb1 ] ) can be presented in the form : @xmath66 where the function @xmath67 and its argument are @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 is for the undulator frequency .",
    "expression ( [ quasi_5 ] ) together with the definitons ( [ quasi_8 ] ) clearly exhibit the features typical for the undulator radiation @xcite .",
    "the radiation intensity is proportional to the square of the total number of the undulator periods , @xmath70 , reflecting the coherence effect of radiation .",
    "the spectral and angular dependence of the radiation are determined mainly by the function @xmath67 , which is well - known in a classical theory of diffraction @xcite .",
    "this function has sharp maxima at the points @xmath71 .",
    "it is most clearly seen in the case of infinite @xmath7 : @xmath72 for @xmath73 the function @xmath67 has main maxima in the points @xmath74 where its magnitude @xmath75 . in the interval",
    "@xmath76 $ ] @xmath67 has minima in the points @xmath77 , @xmath78 where @xmath79 . the local maxima are located at @xmath80 ( @xmath78 ) which can be found from the equation @xmath81 .",
    "the values @xmath82 rapidly decrease with @xmath12 and are much smaller than 1 . for @xmath83",

    "the emission effectively occurs into the cone @xmath116 .",
    "the formalism sketched above will be now applied to a planar harmonic undulator , in which the quasi - periodic trajectory ( [ quasi_1 ] ) lies in a plane .",

    "in this type of an undulator the particle trajectory is purely harmonic and is defined as @xmath118 we assume that the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath119 satisfy the condition @xmath120 . in the next section , where the undulator based on the acoustic wave transmission in a crystal is described in detail ,",
    "it is demonstrated that this condition is fulfilled .    for an ultra - relativistic projectile , moving along the trajectory ( [ yz ] ) the following formulas are valid for the quantities introduced above (",

    "the latter as it will be illustrated in the next sections .",
    "the validity of the classical treatment of the particle motion in a bent channel allows to apply the quasi - classical approach , described in the previous section , for calculating the characteristics of the undulator radiation .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for the spectral and the angular distrbutions of the spontaneous undulator radiation formed during a passage of an ultra - relativistic particle through an acoustically bent crystal .",
    "the calculations are performed by using the formalism outlined in .",

    "is governed by the behaviour of the function @xmath67 defined in .",
    "two 3d plots in figures [ fig.4_2](a ) and [ fig.4_2](b ) allow to visualize the spatial behaviour of the angular distribution of the radiation ( at fixed frequency ) as a function of the azimuthal , @xmath124 , and the polar , @xmath93 , angles of the photon emission .",
    "in these figures the quantity @xmath280 ( measured along the @xmath2-axis ) as a function of the azimuthal , @xmath124 , and the polar , @xmath93 , angles of the photon emission is plotted for two central harmonics .",
    "( a ) represents the distribution of the radiation in the odd harmonic @xmath281 mev with @xmath282 , ( b ) corresponds to the emission in the even harmonic @xmath283 mev , @xmath284 .",

    "figures [ fig.4_2](a , b ) illustrate general features intrinsic to the planar undulator radiation in the case @xmath145 .",
    "we first note that the intensity of the radiation in the odd harmonic is governed by a powerful maximum in the forward direction , whereas there is no radiation in even harmonics for @xmath290 the latter reaches its maximal values in nearly forward , but not in forward , directions . apart from the intensity peak in the forward ( for @xmath89 odd ) or nearly forward ( @xmath89 even ) direction ,",
    "the radiation in a particular harmonic is emitted in a wide range of the polar angles . in both of the figures",
    "there are several clearly distinct non - forward peaks in which the radiation intensity reaches the maxima , although the magnitudes of @xmath291 in the maxima at @xmath292 rapidly decrease with the polar angle ( recall the log scale along the @xmath2-axis ) .",
    "another feature to be mentioned is the abscence of the axial symmetry in the angular distribution shape .",
    "more specifically , the radiation emitted within the undulator plane is concentrated in the cone @xmath293 , whereas the cone angle for the photon emission in the direction perpendicular to the @xmath285 plane equals @xmath294 .",

    "this ratio is equal to 2.2 in the considered case .",
    "this peculiarity most clearly exhibits itself in the shape of the spatial distribution of the radiation in the odd harmonics in the forward direction , see ( a ) .    by changing the parameters of the acoustically based undulator ( which are the aw amplitude and frequency , the type of a crystal , and the relativistic factor @xmath1 of the projectile positron ) it is possible to vary the intensity of the radiation , the energy , width and the number of emitted harmonics . to illustrate this statement in figures [ fig.4_3](a , b , c ) we present the dependencies of the spectral distribution of the radiation emitted at @xmath277 for a 2 , 5 and 10 gev positron channelling along ( 110 ) planes in @xmath221 and @xmath220 crystals .",

    "the aw frequency is fixed at @xmath313 mhz . in these figures",
    "each curve shows the @xmath314-dependence obtained at a particular value of the aw amplitude and the corresponding value of the undulator parameter @xmath8 , as indicated .",
    "the lowest values for the aw amplitude are chosen to be consistent with the condition ( [ aw_0 ] ) , where the parameter @xmath14 is equal to 1.26   for a diamond and 2.24   for a tungsten ( 110 ) channels @xcite .",
    "the largest @xmath4-values correspond to the relation @xmath315 ( see ( [ aw_8 ] ) ) .",
    "these figures demonstrate that at a certain frequency @xmath207 the intensity of radiation can be varied in a wide range by altering the aw amplitude , which is proportional to the value of the undulator parameter as @xmath316 , or by choosing the type of a crystal .",
    "the latter option affects the value of the undulator parameter via its dependence on the sound velocity @xmath206 : @xmath317 .",
    "therefore , for equal @xmath4 , @xmath207 and @xmath1 the air intensity , being proportional to @xmath8 ( see ( [ sp1 ] ) ) , is approximately @xmath318 times higher for a tungsten crystal as compared with that for a diamond .",
    "the radiation intensity can also be varied by changing the aw frequency at some constant value of @xmath4 .",
    "this possibility is illustrated by figures [ fig.4_5](a , b ) where the dependencies of @xmath309 on @xmath314 for @xmath319 and @xmath311 gev positron channeled in @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath33 crystals are presented .",
    "the spectral distributions calculated at different energies @xmath13 of a positron channeling in @xmath220 and @xmath33 crystals are compared in .",
    "the features to be discussed in connection with all these figures are the pattern of the spectral distribution shape and its transformation with the increase in @xmath13 .",
    "it was noted above ( see the discussion below ) that for @xmath320 the intensity of the undulator radiation ( both the angular and the spectral ones ) exponentially decreases to zero . within the frame of the quasi - classical approximation the photon frequency @xmath314",
    "is related to the quantity @xmath321 through the first equality in ( [ wkb3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the intensity of radiation effectively falls off for the photon energies satisfying the relation @xmath322 here @xmath323 cm is the compton wavelength of the positron . to obtain the equality in ( [ additional1 ] ) we made use of @xmath324 and @xmath325 .    in the case of @xmath326 , which is achieved by choosing relatively low values of the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath4 or @xmath207 , the spectrum of radiation",
    "is concentrated in the region of low photon energies , @xmath327 whereas for @xmath328 it rapidly drops to zero , as follows from the estimation ( [ additional1 ] ) .",
    "such a behaviour most vividly is illustrated by ( a ) ( see also the curves for the c ( 110 ) channel in ( b ) and for the si ( 110 ) and ge ( 110 ) channels in ( b ) ) .    by increasing @xmath1",
    "the parameter @xmath329 becomes @xmath330 , leading to a prominent increase in the intensity of radiation in the high - energy photon region , @xmath328 .",
    "the curves for the w ( 110 ) channel in ( b ) and the curve for a 250 gev positron channelling in w ( 110 ) ( see ) clearly exhibit the transformation of the spectral distribution shape : it becomes flatter , thus reflecting that , except for the regions @xmath331 and @xmath332 , the probability of the photon emission is almost independent on the photon energy .",

    "it is seen that for @xmath347 and @xmath348 cm there are wide ranges of positron energy ( @xmath13 from @xmath349 gev up to several tens of gev ) and aw frequency ( @xmath207 from several mhz up to several tens of mhz ) for which all the undulator conditions ( [ aw_8a ] , [ cond1 ] , [ cond3 ] ) are fulfilled and , simultaneously , the relative energy loss due to the acoustically induced radiation is negligibly small .",
    "in this section we discuss the possibility to generate stimulated emission of high energy photons by means of a bunch of ultra - relativistic particles of length @xmath350 moving in a channel bent by a transverse acoustic wave .",
    "the mechanism of the emission stimulation is illustrated in figure [ fig5.1 ] .",
    "the photons emitted in the nearly forward direction at some maximum / minimum point of the trajectory by a group of particles of the bunch stimulate the emission of the same photons by another ( succeding ) group of particles of the same bunch when it reaches next maximum / minimum .",
    "this scheme implies that the stimulation is due to the motion of the same bunch along the trajectory ( [ aw_1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the bunch velocity @xmath181 , its length @xmath350 and the length of the crystal @xmath25 must satisfy the condition @xmath351 which means that the electromagnetic wave does not slip against the bunch of particles by more than @xmath350 on the lenghtscale @xmath352 and , thus , the amplification occurs during each of the undulator periods of total number @xmath353 .    in the theory of free - electron lasers ( fel ) this principle is called `` self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) '' @xcite and usually is referred to the fel operation in the high gain ( or collective instability ) regime @xcite .",
    "an accurate treatment of the evolution of the photon pulse in the sase mode implies that the space charge fields , energy spread of the particles in the beam and diffraction effects are taken into account @xcite . in the case",
    "when the beam undergoes channeling the picture must be additionally complicated by considering the dechanneling dynamics @xcite as well as the photon attenuation @xcite .",
    "we do not aim to fulfil this program in the present paper . instead ,",
    "for the suggested undulator , we shall present an estimate of the gain exploiting the general relationship between gain and spontaneous spectrum of undulator radiation @xcite .",
    "thus , we disregard the dynamics of the particles in the undulator and consider the case of a monoenergetic beam of independent particles .",
    "additionally we assume that there is no beam divergence .",
    "the effects of dechanneling and photon attenuation are discussed qualitatively on a phenomenological level .",
    "it is our aim to establish the range of parameters ( which are : the aw amplitude and frequency ( wavelength ) , the type of the particle and its energy , and the type of a crystal ) within which there is a principle possibility to consider the sase radiation by means of the acoustically bent crystal .",

    "the only exception is the @xmath522 dependence for a @xmath523 mev positron beam channeling along the ( 100 ) plane in @xmath33 ( see ( a ) ) . in this case , due to the irregularity in the behaviour of @xmath504 in the vicinity of the @xmath524 atomic threshold ( @xmath525 kev for @xmath33 ) ,  see figure [ fig5.4 ] ,  the minimum of the beam density is achieved at @xmath526 kev .",
    "illustrates the extent to which the photon attenuation influences the minimum value of the beam density . for each crystal ( as indicated ) the dependence @xmath522 from is represented by the curves without full circles .",
    "the curves embedded with full circles correspond to the function @xmath527_{\\mu(\\omega)\\equiv 0}$ ] , giving thus the minimum values of the volume density which is needed to achieve the total gain @xmath512 in the case when the photon attenuation is totally disregarded .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath528 mev the role of the attenuation is negligibly small for all crystals , whereas for less energetic photons it leads to a prominent increase in @xmath365 .",
    "figures [ fig5.5 ] and [ fig5.6 ] show that to achieve a noticeable level of the amplification of the spontaneous radiation formed in the acoustically based undulator large magnitudes of a positron beam volume density , @xmath529 , are needed .",
    "this is mainly due to the dechanneling effect which imposes strong restrictions on the undulator length .",
    "these values of @xmath365 , being high enough , are , nevertheless comparable with those planned to be achieved within the tesla project @xcite .    therefore , we believe that the scheme described above may be considered as a new feasible source for stimulated emission within the photon energies range from tens of kev up to mev by means of the positron beam channeling in an acoustically bent crystal .",
    "our investigation shows that a crystal , which is periodically bent by a transverse acoustic wave , can be used for the construction of an undulator for a beam of ultra - relativistic particles channeled in the lattice .",
    "the parameters of this undulator can be tuned by varying the aw amplitude and frequency , the energy of the projectile , and by using different types of crystals and its channels .",
    "the suggested undulator can be used for the generation of the radiation of high energy photons .",
    "also , it is shown that it is meaningful to discuss the possibility to create a powerful source of a free - electron laser type stimulated radiation in the energy range of tens of kev up to the mev region .",
    "we consider our present research as an initial milestone for more advanced theoretical treatment of the problem .",
    "the goal of this further investigation is to achieve more accurate quantitative description of the undulator radiation and the corresponding laser effect . in out opinion , on this way the following phenomena must be thoroughly considered .    * _ the air mechanism for a wide beam .",
    "_ when the wide beam enters the crystal it is spread over many channels .",
    "each channel is bent by the aw and , hence , one must ( when calculating spontaneous and stimulated emission ) take into account the photon fluxes formed by these sub - beams . in this case",
    "the coherence effect in the photon emission can be enhanced due to the interaction of the photons with the particles moving in many neighbouring channels . in the present paper",
    "we have investigated the undulator and the laser effects in a single channel . *",
    "_ kinetics in the air problem .",
    "_ the more advanced description of the air problem must take into account the kinetic behaviour of the particles in the beam as well as kinetics of the photon flux .",
    "such a description will treat properly the dechanneling mechanism , the attenuation phenomenon and the interaction of photons and particles beams . * _ dechanneling in a periodically bent lattice .",
    "_ it is necessary to study dechanneling in a periodically bent channel in comparison with this effect in a straight channel and/or in a channel with constant ( or / and slowly varied ) curvature .",
    "so far nobody studied dechanneling in a periodically bent channel ( the aw bending ) .",
    "the dechanneling length might increase as compared with the linear channel case .",
    "the dechanneling length plays the crucial role for the laser effect which we discuss in our paper ( see section [ stimulated ] ) .",
    "indeed , increasing of the dechanneling length by factor of 10 results in decreasing of the channeling beam density , necessary for achievement of large gain @xmath507 , by the factor of 1000 ( see eqs .",
    "( 56 ) and ( 79 ) ) .",
    "+ let us stress here that special attention must be paid the problem of dechanneling of a _ wide _ beam in a periodically bent crystal .",
    "broadening of the channeled beam in such a medium , which was not considered before , is important in our problem . * _ the bunching effect .",
    "_ the effect of the stimulation of photon emission can be enhanced by increasing density @xmath365 of the channeling beam . from the theory of free electron lasers ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "it is known that for high @xmath365 large gain factors can be achieved in the regime of collective instabilities in the beam ( the bunching effect ) . in our future reaserch",
    "we plan to apply the results of the fel theory to the description of the laser - type radiation based on the air phenomenon . *",
    "_ acoustic waves of various configurations .",
    "_ in the present paper we investigated spontaneous and stimulated air in an acoustically bent crystal considering the most simple example of the acoustic wave , the monochromatic plane wave .",
    "however , other cases of aw ( longitudinal waves , spherical waves , non - monochromatic waves and various combinations thereof ) , interacting with the beam of the channeling particles , are worthy to study . by applying the more complex acoustic waves for",
    "the crystal bending one may construct an undulator with variable parameters for the generation of high energy photons in a wide range .",
    "the use of the crystal - based undulator with variable parameters may result in noticeable increase of the gain factor for the stimulated air analogously to how it occues in the free electron lasers based on the tampered magnetic wigglers @xcite . *",
    "_ combination of the ordinary channeling radiation and the air . _",
    "the present consideration was focused on the case of the high amplitude aw ( see ( 1 ) ) .",
    "this allowed us to disregard the contribution of the ordinary channeling radiation to the total spectrum of the emitted photons .",
    "more general approach must include both radiative mechanisms , as well as their interference , simultaneously .",
    "the rigorous treatment of the above outlined problems will be the subject of further publications .",
