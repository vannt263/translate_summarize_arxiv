    "there is no physical system that is truly isolated from the rest of the world , the closed system idealization may be convenient but becomes poor or completely invalid for many questions of modern - day science . in nuclear physics , as interests shift towards weakly bound , unbound or even dynamically evolving reaction states , the theoretical approaches for dealing with unstable dynamics of open quantum systems with multiple degrees of freedom must be revisited .",
