    "the last unexplored frontier of the standard model is electroweak symmetry breaking , the process by which the higgs field obtains a vacuum expectation value and gives mass to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge bosons .",
    "one of the major goals of current colliders is to discover the higgs boson and understand the dynamics that give rise to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "there have been direct and indirect searches for the standard model ( sm ) higgs at lep and the tevatron .",
    "the current lower bound on the higgs mass , @xmath2 comes from searches at lep for @xmath3 , with the sm higgs decaying to a pair of taus or bottom quarks @xcite .",
    "recently , combined higgs searches from the cdf and @xmath4 experiments at the tevatron excluded a sm - like higgs of @xmath5 @xcite .    while direct searches for the higgs point towards a heavy mass , indirect bounds from electroweak constraints place a limit on how heavy the mass can be . in particular ,",
    "the best fit for a sm higgs mass is 77 gev with a 95% upper bound of 167 gev @xcite .",
    "this limit comes from measurements of electroweak parameters that depend logarithmically on the higgs mass through radiative corrections .",
    "there is tension between the direct and indirect measurements ; only a narrow window of masses for the sm higgs satisfies both results .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "a light higgs is preferred within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "requiring a natural theory and minimizing fine tuning drives the higgs mass below the lep direct bound . in the mssm , there are two new higgs chiral superfields , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , that result in two cp - even scalars @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the cp - odd scalar @xmath10 , and the charged higgs @xmath11 after electroweak symmetry breaking . typically , the @xmath9 has standard model - like couplings . at the one - loop level ,",
    "the higgs boson mass is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dimensionless trilinear coupling between the higgs and top squarks @xmath14 for a moderate @xmath15 and top squarks lighter than 1 tev , the higgs mass is less than 120 gev @xcite . by taking @xmath13 to `` maximal mixing , '' where the contribution from the @xmath16-terms gives the largest contribution to the higgs mass",
    ", the higgs can be as heavy as 130 gev while keeping the top squarks under 1 tev .",
    "two - loop corrections can raise the higgs mass by an additional @xmath17 6 gev @xcite .    to avoid fine tuning",
    ", the top squarks should not be significantly heavier than the higgs . even with masses at 1 tev , the higgs potential is tuned at the few percent level .",
    "if the top squarks are at 400 gev , the fine tuning of the higgs potential drops substantially ; however , the upper limit on the higgs mass falls to 120 gev even with maximal top squark mixing @xcite .",
    "this has motivated studies giving the higgs quartic coupling additional contributions inside the supersymmetric standard model @xcite , which usually leads to a less minimal higgs sector such as in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "alternate models of electroweak symmetry breaking that can have naturally light higgs bosons are motivated by the indirect bounds coming from electroweak constraints and the desire to minimize fine tuning in the higgs sector . these models , which often have more elaborate higgs potentials with additional scalar fields , allow light higgs masses , while simultaneously evading the lep direct bound .",
    "frequently , these less minimal models of electroweak symmetry breaking have approximate global symmetries and light pseudo - goldstone bosons that can alter the phenomenology of the higgs .",
    "these light pseudo - goldstone bosons can evade all existing limits because they couple very weakly to light flavor fermions .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on such non - minimal models of electroweak supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we begin in section ii with a brief discussion of higgs models that contain light pseudo - goldstone bosons , focusing primarily on current experimental constraints . in section iii ,",
    "we propose a new search for higgs bosons that cascade decay to pseudoscalars with masses below 10 gev .",
    "in particular , we find that the higgs can be discovered in a subdominant decay mode where one pseudoscalar decays to muons and the other to taus .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the expected sensitivity to the higgs production cross section at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "the proposed search would allow possible discovery of a cascade - decaying higgs with the complete tevatron data set or early data at the lhc .",
    "in this section , we explore the couplings of a light pseudo - goldstone boson , or `` axion , '' to the standard model .",
    "we will describe how to analyze a general theory and we find constraints on the maximal width for a higgs decaying into a light axion .",
    "finally , we will analyze how cleo limits on the direct coupling between pseudo - goldstones and standard model fermions set constraints on the higgs width into axions . for type ii two higgs doublet models ( _ i.e. _ , mssm ) , the cleo and lep results place important limits on the light axion scenario .",
    "the tension between the lep limit on the higgs mass and fine tuning can be reduced if the higgs branching fractions are altered from those of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the lep bound of @xmath19 gev only applies when the higgs decays dominantly to a @xmath20 or @xmath21 pair .",
    "while adding new , invisible decay modes does not help because bounds for such processes are just as strong @xcite , other nonstandard decays remain open possibilities .",
    "consider the case where the higgs decays dominantly to two new scalars @xmath22 , which in turn decay to sm particles : @xmath23 for an @xmath9 with sm - like production cross section , this process is excluded for @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , there is an 82 gev model - independent bound from lep @xcite and when @xmath26 , there are no limits for higgs masses above 86 gev @xcite .",
    "the decay width of a 100 gev higgs into standard model particles is @xmath27 2.6 mev ; because the decay width is so small , the standard model decay mode is easily suppressed by the presence of new decay modes .",
    "any new light particle with @xmath28 coupling to the higgs will swamp the decay modes into sm particles .",
    "many theories , such as little higgs models and non - supersymmetric two higgs doublet models , have light neutral states for the higgs to decay into .",
    "this phenomenon arises when there is an approximate symmetry of the higgs potential that is explicitly broken by a small term in the potential .",
    "there is a resulting light pseudo - goldstone boson that couples significantly to the higgs boson .",
    "the peccei - quinn symmetry of a two higgs doublet model is one such example . in the mssm",
    ", it is possible to have a light @xmath10 , even with radiative corrections included @xcite .",
    "more often , there is an additional singlet , @xmath29 , and an approximate symmetry that acts upon the higgs boson doublets as @xmath30 with the singlet compensating by @xmath31 . during electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ", @xmath29 also acquires a vev , spontaneously breaking the symmetry ; the phase of @xmath29 becomes a pseudo - goldstone boson and has small interactions with the standard model when @xmath32 .    for specificity ,",
    "let us consider a two higgs doublet model with an additional complex singlet .",
    "all three scalar fields acquire vacuum expectation values : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the interactions of the pseudo - goldstone bosons can be described in the exponential basis @xmath36 the pseudoscalar fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 get interactions either through derivative couplings from the kinetic terms or through explicit symmetry breaking . one linear combination of the pseudoscalars , @xmath39 becomes the longitudinal component of the @xmath1 .",
    "the two other combinations are physical fluctuations that get mass through symmetry breaking effects in the higgs potential .",
    "any terms in the higgs potential proportional to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 do not affect the mass or interactions of the pseudo - goldstones and there are only a handful of possibilities for explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "as an example , consider adding to the potential a sizeable coupling @xmath43 this will give a weak - scale mass to the following linear combination of pseudo - goldstones : @xmath44 the singlet mixing component is given by @xmath45 the remaining linearly independent pseudo - goldstone will be massless until the final symmetry is broken .",
    "this linear combination is @xmath46 and gets a mass through potentials such as @xmath47 there will be mixing between @xmath18 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , when @xmath48 , @xmath10 and @xmath18 are nearly mass eigenstates with residual mixing proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth noting that as @xmath50 , the light pseudoscalar becomes the peccei - quinn pseudoscalar and its couplings are independent of @xmath51 .",
    "this particular example has the same symmetry structure as the nmssm near the r - symmetric limit when @xmath52 @xmath16-term dominates the @xmath53 @xmath16-term .",

    "1 ) , and one might worry that radiative corrections from the higgs - pseudoscalar interaction might induce a large radiative correction to the pseudoscalar mass . however , the interaction that leads to the higgs decay into pseudoscalars can occur even if the axion is an exact goldstone boson through the coupling @xmath59 the first interaction preserves the @xmath60 shift symmetry , where @xmath61 is an @xmath28 constant and @xmath62 gev is the electroweak scale . because this coupling exists in the symmetry - preserving limit , @xmath61 can only depend on the vevs of the higgs fields , the particular charges of the approximate @xmath63 symmetry , and on the alignment of the physical higgs boson relative to the higgs vev direction .",
    "when the physical higgs boson is in the direction of the higgs vev , @xmath64 , the example above gives @xmath65 the second interaction breaks the shift symmetry and is proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "this term depends on the symmetry breaking that gives the axion a mass and is therefore model - dependent .",
    "when the physical higgs boson aligns with the higgs vev , the symmetry breaking coupling simplifies to @xmath67 for the potential in eq .",

    "for instance , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath73 of course , this is the technical definition of fine tuning and when @xmath74 , @xmath18 has been fine tuned to be light .",

    "there are specific challenges to the @xmath115 decay channel , however .",
    "the branching fraction of the taus to leptons is only 33% and the @xmath116 spectrum of the events is soft because the visible lepton carries less than half the momentum of the tau .",
    "additionally , it is challenging to reconstruct the higgs and pseudoscalar masses from the final decay products .",
    "the primary innovation of the search proposed in this paper is to use the subdominant decay of the @xmath18 into two muons , which exists because the @xmath18 couples to the standard model by mixing through the cp - odd higgs . the relative branching ratio for the @xmath18 into muons versus taus is @xmath117 the cross section of @xmath118 depends upon the following product of branching ratios : @xmath119 for @xmath120 , a 7 gev pseudoscalar has a 0.4% branching ratio into muons and 98% ratio into taus . as @xmath83 goes from the bottom threshold to the tau threshold , @xmath121 varies from 0.8% to 1.5% .",

    "the sensitivity is weaker for higgs masses below 100 gev because the backgrounds worsen due to a smaller @xmath137 cut .",
    "however , combined analyses by cdf and @xmath4 should be able to probe this region down to a @xmath188 . by the time the lhc reaches a luminosity of 5 fb@xmath142",
    ", it will be sensitive to the most relevant region of parameter space , with @xmath189 .",
    "the sensitivity curves depend on the product of the pseudoscalar branching ratios into muons and taus , @xmath190 . for fig .",
    "[ fig : excplot ] , we assumed that the pseudoscalar was 7 gev , which corresponds to @xmath191 . for a lighter pseudoscalar ( e.g. , 4 gev )",
    ", @xmath190 is nearly double this value . in this case",
    ", the signal limits can increase by as much as a factor of two .",
    "to first order in @xmath192 , the branching fraction of the higgs into the pseudoscalar is independent of @xmath83 and the contour lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : excplot ] are unaffected .",
    "therefore , if the pseudoscalar is near the tau threshold , the experiments are even more sensitive to the higgs production cross section than indicated in the figure .",
    "we have shown that if the higgs decays into a pair of light pseudoscalars that subsequently decay into taus , then the discovery of the higgs boson is promising through the subdominant channel where one pseudoscalar decays to a pair of muons .",
    "the tevatron has a chance of discovering this class of models if cdf and @xmath4 perform combined analyses with the full data sets .",
    "the tevatron can begin to recover the parameter space that lep missed with their @xmath193 search , which was prematurely stopped at 86 .",
    "assuming that the only new decay mode of the higgs boson is into a pair of pseudoscalars , the tevatron is sensitive to @xmath194 with 10 @xmath195 , and up to @xmath196 with 20 @xmath195 .",
    "when the tevatron covers this ground , their results , combined with the direct limits from lep , will effectively establish a lower limit on the higgs mass regardless of the admixture of higgs decays into light pseudoscalars or standard model fermions . with a 20 @xmath195 cross section",
    ", the tevatron will be sensitive to higgs bosons up to @xmath197 .    at the lhc , this search becomes a method of discovering the higgs with early data  potentially with sub - fb@xmath198 data sets . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath199 , the lhc will be able to recover the missing lep limits .",
    "eventually , the lhc will be able to push this branching ratio down substantially , to the 3% level .",
    "a discovery or even a limit on such a decay mode will be an important step in verifying the field content and symmetry structure of the higgs potential .",
    "we are especially grateful to andy haas for collaboration throughout the course of this work .",
    "the results of the @xmath4 search for @xmath200 with 3.7 fb@xmath142 have been published @xcite .",
    "we would also like to thank johan alwall for his assistance with madgraph / madevent , as well as spencer chang , chris hays , david e. kaplan , aaron pierce , philip schuster , natalia toro , and neil weiner for helpful discussions .",
