    "a recent focal point of studies on nonlinear oscillators is one - dimensional ( 1d ) granular crystals , which consist of closely packed chains of elastically colliding particles . because of the contact interaction between particles ,",
    "granular crystals are characterized by a highly nonlinear dynamic response .",
    "this has inspired numerous studies of the interplay between nonlinearity and discreteness @xcite .",
    "granular crystals can be created from numerous material types and sizes , making their properties extremely tunable @xcite . because they provide an experimental setting that is both tractable and flexible , granular crystals are an excellent testbed for investigating the effects of structural and material heterogeneities on nonlinear wave dynamics .",
    "recent studies have examined the role of defects @xcite , interfaces between two different types of particles @xcite , decorated and/or tapered chains @xcite , chains of diatomic and triatomic units @xcite , and quasiperiodic and random configurations @xcite .",
    "the tunability of granular crystals is valuable not only for basic studies of the underlying physics but also in potential engineering applications , including shock and energy absorbing layers @xcite , sound focusing devices and delay lines @xcite , actuators @xcite , vibration absorption layers @xcite , and sound scramblers @xcite .",
    "an important context for the present paper is the consideration of disordered settings in nonlinear oscillator chains . some of the most prominent recent investigations in this area have generalized to weakly nonlinear settings @xcite the ideas of p.  w. anderson , who showed theoretically that the diffusion of waves is curtailed in linear media that contain sufficient randomness induced by defects or impurities @xcite .",
    "research on the anderson transition is extremely exciting and is germane to the investigation of disordered systems more generally , but our goal in this study departs somewhat from this thread , as we seek to investigate order - disorder transitions in _ strongly nonlinear _",
    "media such as granular crystals .",
    "this is a key challenge in the study of nonlinear chains @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate 1d granular crystals that consist of chains of elastic spheres that interact via hertzian contacts .",
    "the chains are composed of diatomic units : two - mass cells ( henceforth called dimers `` ) that each consist of one particle of one type ( type 1 '' ) and one particle with different properties ( type 2 `` ) . each dimer can be arranged in one of two orientations : type 1 followed by type 2 or vice versa . to quantify the nature of the disorder and define the chain configuration",
    ", we borrow an idea from statistical physics and treat each cell as a spin '' ( where , for example , spin up `` is characterized by a dimer composed of a type 1 particle followed by a type 2 particle , and spin down '' is characterized by a dimer composed of a type 2 particle followed by a type 1 particle ) .",
    "this allows a novel perspective on investigations of granular crystals , as one can examine the wave propagation dynamics as a function of an order parameter , which we define using the ratio of the number of spins oriented in the same direction to the total number of spins .",
    "borrowing another technique of statistical physics ( which , in particular , is used in the context of disordered systems ) , we take an ensemble average of quantities that characterize the wave propagation ( amplitude , wave velocity , etc . ) over chain configurations with the same level of disorder . accordingly , as disorder increases , we are able to show that the wave transmission decreases rapidly , saturating to a value that is independent of the chain heterogeneity .    to characterize the order - disorder transition , we analyze local properties of the wave ( namely , its amplitude and spatial structure ) during its propagation .",
    "this reveals two propagation mechanisms : we find solitary waves below a threshold level of disorder and delocalized waves above it .",
    "we use the term wave delocalization \" to mean that the spatial structure of the solitary waves  which extend over only a few beads and are observed in the low - disorder regime ",
    "disappears with increasing disorder , giving rise to a significantly more extended wave structure that is present over a long portion of the chain .",
    "we also investigate the effects of chain length and material properties and propose a simple theoretical description  based on a scattering mechanism across individual defects in the chain  that accounts for most of the wave properties .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we detail our definition of elastic spin chains in section [ sec2 ] and discuss the setup for our experiments and numerical computations , respectively , in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] .",
    "we then discuss in more detail the order - disorder transition and the dynamics in the low - disorder and high - disorder regimes in sections [ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] .",
    "we discuss our results in section [ section_discussion ] and conclude in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "the concept of spin has been used successfully to describe myriad physical phenomena , such as magnetization and glassiness @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply this idea to analyze order versus disorder in granular crystals .",
    "fully ordered diatomic chains allow the propagation of solitary waves @xcite .",
    "however , an orientation reversal of even one cell causes a defect in the system , leading to complicated dynamics such as partial wave reflections and radiation shedding @xcite . increasing the heterogeneity of the chain further via random arrangements of cells alters the dynamics of wave propagation drastically and necessitates a different approach . to understand such heterogeneous granular chains",
    ", we characterize the level of disorder in the chain by using the diagnostic @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of dimers ( spins ) with one orientation ( called up `` ) and @xmath2 is the number of dimers with the opposite spin ( called down '' ) .",
    "the total number of spins , @xmath3 , is equal to one half of the number of particles in the chain . by convention",
    ", we say that a dimer has spin `` up '' if the heavier particle is nearer the direction of the original incident wave . the definition ( [ mag ] ) guarantees that maximum order  the case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which all dimers have the same orientation  occurs when @xmath4 .",
    "minimum order ( and hence maximum disorder ) occurs when @xmath5 , which yields @xmath6 . gives maximum order because of higher - order correlations . upon averaging ,",
    "these contribute little to the expected dynamics due to their low probability of occurrence . ]",
    "the quantity @xmath7 thereby measures the amount of heterogeneity in the granular chain .",
    "it is worth remarking that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of  defects \" ( situations in which consecutive spins have opposite orientation ) in the chain .",
    "one obtains a given value of @xmath7 for many different possible combinations of dimers , so @xmath7 indicates only the presence of defective \" spins and not their location . to account for this ,",
    "we average over multiple disordered configurations with equal values of @xmath7 .",
    "the effect of the level of disorder @xmath7 on the transmission of nonlinear waves through the chain is the central point of this study .",
    "as @xmath7 increases , we expect the amplitude of the transmitted force to decrease",
    ". however , our study reveals ( see the discussion below ) that this is true only for sufficiently small values of the parameter @xmath7 , for which the solitary - like wave structure is preserved .",
    "in contrast , we observe waves with delocalized structure at larger values of @xmath7 , and the wave propagation is no longer affected by the level of heterogeneity in the chain .",
    "the issues that we address below are ( 1 ) when this transition occurs and ( 2 ) how we can characterize and interpret both of these regimes .",
    "to experimentally investigate the order - disorder transition in granular chains , we construct chains of dimer cells composed of units of spherical beads of two different materials and/or sizes .",
    "for the experimental results in our main discussion , we use 4.76 mm radius stainless steel ( non - magnetic , 316 type ) and aluminum ( al ; 2017-t4 type ) spheres .",
    "the steel and al beads , respectively , have masses 3.63 g and 1.26 g , elastic moduli @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and poisson ratios 0.30 and 0.33 @xcite .",
    "we examine chains with various sequences of up and down cells and assemble each chain in a horizontal setup [ see fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) ] that is composed of two steel bars clamped on a sine plate .",
    "we ensure contact ( and hence 1d impact and wave propagation ) between the particles by tilting the guide slightly ( 3.5 degrees ) .",
    "the chain is 31 cells long .",
    "we generate the incident solitary waves by impacting the chain with a steel particle striker \" ( of the same size as the steel particles in the chain ) , which is launched down a ramp . based on the drop height of the striker",
    ", we calculate its impact velocity to be about @xmath12 m / s for these experiments . to visualize the traveling waves directly",
    ", we place piezo sensors ( @xmath13 , piezo systems inc . )",
    "inside small ( 2.38 mm radius ) stainless steel beads ( non - magnetic , 316 type ) @xcite that we use in place of the light al particle in the 20th and 25th cells .",
    "the sensors are kept in place by thin support plates with circular holes whose diameter is slightly larger than that of the beads .    using this setup",
    ", we consider values of the parameter @xmath7 , which characterizes the level of disorder in the first 20 pairs of the chain ( see the discussion above ) , ranging from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.1 .",
    "for each value , we consider 3 different dimer cell arrangements , and we average the results from 3 striker drops for each such arrangement .",
    "we also performed similar experiments with other types of diatomic chains  including one composed of large stainless steel ( radius 4.76 mm ) and small ( 2.38 mm ) stainless steel spheres and another composed of small stainless steel and small ptfe ( also 2.38 mm ) spheres .",
    "we obtained consistent results with all of the considered configurations . in our discussion",
    "below , we present the steel - aluminum example .",
    "we model a chain of @xmath14 spherical beads as a 1d lattice with ( conservative ) hertzian interactions between particles @xcite : @xmath15}\\ , , \\label{motion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the coordinate of the center of the @xmath18th particle measured from its equilibrium position , @xmath19 for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the elastic modulus of the @xmath18th particle , @xmath24 is its poisson ratio , @xmath25 is its mass , and @xmath26 is its radius .",
    "the particle @xmath27 represents the striker , and the @xmath28th particle represents the wall .",
    "the initial velocity of the striker is determined from experiment , and all other particles start at rest in their equilibrium positions .",
    "we compare numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) with experiments using the same type and quantity of particles composing the chain , the same `` spin configuration '' , and the same excitation input .",
    "once the striker hits the first bead , a compression wave propagates through the chain .",
    "we measure the force of the propagating wave using a sensor that we placed in the 20th cell . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , we show plots of force versus time for both low and high values of @xmath7 for the experiments and the numerical computations .",
    "panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the peak amplitude of the transmitted wave as a function of @xmath7 for both experiments and numerical simulations . in both plots ,",
    "we show the normalized force ( which is given by the measured force divided by the peak force that we obtained in the perfectly ordered case ) .",
    "we consider three arrangements corresponding to each @xmath7 value , and we acquire three independent measurements for each arrangement to verify experimental reproducibility . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , we show the force - time history averaged over all three different dimer cell arrangements at each level of disorder . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , we show the peak normalized transmitted force .",
    "each color / shape corresponds to a given spin configuration at the stated value of @xmath7 , and each marker represents a single experimental run .",
    "the solid curve gives the median transmitted force value for each level of disorder .",
    "the squares give the results of the numerical runs that correspond to the median experimental configurations .",
    "we observe good qualitative agreement between numerics and experiments .",
    "note , in particular , the decrease of the peak force as @xmath7 becomes larger .",
    "because the numerics and experiments agree qualitatively  the small quantitative difference arises from experimental dissipation that is not modeled in eq .",
    "( [ motion])we focus the remainder of our discussion on the former .",
    "experiments and simulations ( with as many as @xmath29 cells in the latter ) both suggest the existence of two different regimes : at low disorder  i.e . , for @xmath7 smaller than some threshold @xmath30we see numerically that the transmission of the wave decays exponentially with @xmath7 ( see fig .  [ fig2numerics ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the wave propagation depends on the number of defects in the chain in this regime .",
    "this exponential decay arises in the time - evolution of the wave amplitude ( as the wave propagates through one defect after another ) .",
    "the decay of the wave , in turn , induces background excitations . due to the presence of the defects , we observe states that seem to be somewhat reminiscent of the phenomenon of anderson localization . for a detailed discussion of acoustic analogs of anderson localization and excitation of the pertinent modes in linear disordered acoustic chains ,",
    "see ref .",
    "we discuss the similarities and differences between the phenomena that we observe and those known from studies of anderson localization in more detail in section [ section_discussion ] .",
    "our observation that disorder gradually alters the properties of wave propagation is to be expected , given that this also happens in linear settings .",
    "however , for high disorder ( @xmath31 ) , the response of the chain becomes independent of the level of heterogeneity of the system .",
    "this is a fascinating property of highly nonlinear chains ; beyond a critical level of disorder @xmath30 , the wave behavior is insensitive to the level of heterogeneity in the chain . as a result , we see ( based on our numerical observations ) that the peak force of the transmitted wave is well described by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the peak force of the transmitted wave , the original wave s peak force is @xmath34 by normalization with respect to the maximum force in the perfectly periodic chain ( which has @xmath4 ) , @xmath35 is universal , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants whose values depend on the particle geometries ( i.e. , their shape ) and material properties in the chain .",
    "we measured the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 using numerical fitting for our configuration  a large steel : small steel diatomic chain ( the mass ratio is @xmath40 ) .",
    "we show the force transition in both regimes for a large steel : small steel chain with @xmath41 cells in fig .",
    "[ fig2numerics ] .",
    "( in illustrating our results , we focus the discussion in the remainder of this paper on large steel : small steel chains .",

    "namely , @xmath33 decays as a power law in @xmath42 with a coefficient @xmath44 that reflects the nonlinear relationship between the force and displacement and the 1d nature of the configuration .",
    "the value of the power @xmath44 arises from the energy - force scaling of @xmath45 due to the hertzian contact law ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) and , for example , we would instead obtain @xmath47 for a linear contact law ( for which @xmath48 ) . in the next subsection",
    ", we will justify the effect of the chain length when @xmath49 . in section [ secc ]",
    ", we discuss the high - disorder regime and the value of @xmath44 .",
    "the presence of two regimes with very different dynamics in the aggregate response of the disordered chain raises the question of the origin of the transition between them .",
    "below we analyze the spatio - temporal structures of the propagating waves in both regimes and reveal their physical origins .      for concreteness , we frame our discussion using a steel : steel chain with @xmath40 and @xmath41 cells ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig2numerics ] ) , so that @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath51 , the propagating wave consists of a leading pulse that resembles a solitary wave [ see fig .  [ fig_low](a ) ] .",
    "indeed , the width and the shape of the leading pulse are similar to those for ( fully - ordered ) diatomic chains with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , because of the defects , the amplitude of the solitary wave decays as it propagates through the chain . the inset shows the peak force @xmath52 of the pulse as a function of its position @xmath53 in the chain . this force is averaged over various configurations of the chain with the same level of disorder ( i.e. , with the same value of @xmath7 ) . note that @xmath54 denotes the position of the peak force [ so that @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the radius of the first type of particle and @xmath58 is the radius of the second type of particle ) denotes the length of the cell . as the solitary wave propagates",
    ", its peak amplitude decays exponentially : @xmath59 the length scale @xmath60 , which we measure from a fit to the numerical results , is approximately @xmath61 for the large steel : small steel configuration in fig .  [ fig_low ] .",
    "the value of @xmath60 depends on @xmath7 and on the geometries and material properties of the particles .",
    "we show the exponential decay in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_low](a ) .",
    "one might be inclined to think of the parameter @xmath60 as an analog of anderson localization length in disordered linear settings .",
    "a key difference with anderson localization , however , is that the exponential localization that we observe occurs in time ( as the wave propagates through one defect after another ) , whereas localization of anderson modes occurs in space .",
    "keeping this key difference in mind , we nevertheless discuss a possible analogy with linear systems in more detail in section [ section_discussion ] .",
    "the decrease of the wave amplitude is a consequence of the scattering of the wave as it crosses a defect ( i.e. , a flipped spin ) in the chain . to illustrate this process",

    "the generation of additional waves in the chain results in a transfer of energy from the leading pulse to the tail @xcite . as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of weakly nonlinear waves in disordered media , this process can be described by introducing a transmission coefficient @xmath63 across a single defect .",

    "we illustrate this diagnostic in fig .",
    "[ fig_ampl ] for a steel : steel chain with mass ratio @xmath69 .",
    "importantly , the transmission coefficient does not depend on the energy of the incident wave , in contrast to what has been observed in investigations of weakly nonlinear waves @xcite .",

    "[ fig_low ] ( which has a mass ratio of @xmath40 ) and that @xmath71 for the steel : al chain . to illustrate the effect of dimer composition on the value of @xmath63 , we plot @xmath63 as a function of the mass ratio of the beads in a steel : steel chain .",
    "we indicate these values with red circles in fig .",
    "[ fig_t ] .",
    "note that when @xmath72 , it is necessarily also true that @xmath73 , as this corresponds to the propagation of a solitary wave in a fully ordered ( @xmath4 ) diatomic chain .",

    "this yields the exponential decay of eq .",

    "we saw earlier that if the level of disorder in the chain is low ( e.g. , if @xmath49 ) , then the disorder @xmath7 governs the wave transmission through the chain by fixing the number of defects that scatter its energy during propagation .",
    "however , when there are too many defects , the amplitude of the transmitted wave becomes robust to the configuration of the elastic spin chain and no longer depends on @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the wave structure in this high - disorder regime reveals that the spatio - temporal evolution of the wave is now independent of the level of disorder , as the system has reached a level of maximum scattering by the chain heterogeneities and additional defects do not further delocalize the propagating wave .    in fig .",

    ", the transition occurs for smaller values of @xmath30 , and the threshold tends to @xmath105 as the chain becomes infinitely long .",
    "this result can be interpreted as follows : it is the number of defects that the wave encounters rather than the defect density that determines the type of wave propagation ( i.e. , whether one observes a solitary pulse or a delocalized one ) . as a result , for a very long chain ,",
    "even a low defect density is able to generate delocalization .",
    "when the force amplitude of the leading pulse is comparable to that of a reflected wave , we are in the delocalized - wave regime .",

    "in particular , it is interesting to consider the wave - scattering mechanisms that we have observed in elastic spin chains versus the process of anderson localization that can occur in linear and weakly nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "we have observed that the heterogeneities present in the granular chain alter the wave propagation , so that in the limit of a very long chain , even a low defect density is sufficient to prevent wave propagation through the whole system .",

    "( here , we use the terms  localization \" and  localized wave \" to contrast these observations with the extended state of the waves that arise in periodic and perfectly ordered linear chains . )",
    "a signature of anderson localization in linear disordered settings is the exponential decay of the wave amplitude as it propagates through the chain @xcite .",
    "this defines the anderson localization length involved in such an evolution law .",
    "as we have reported in this paper , elastic spin chains exhibit exponential amplitude decay [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) ] for low levels of disorder ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "it is then perhaps tempting to consider the localization length @xmath60 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq_micro ] ) as a nonlinear counterpart of the anderson localization length for highly nonlinear settings .",
    "however , the reader is cautioned towards such a connection , as the decay of the amplitude is connected to the wave propagation over time ( as additional defects are encountered ) and does not really relate to the structure of the spatial profile of the wave .",
    "furthermore , recall ( see , for example , the discussion of section 4.2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that fpu - type systems do not admit a genuine form of anderson localization ( at least for small frequencies ) unless a harmonic on - site potential is added to each node in the lattice . as another point of comparison , we have provided in this paper an expression for @xmath60 as a function of the defect density @xmath7 and the scattering characteristics of one isolated defect @xmath63 , which is also possible for linear disordered chains in some specific situations @xcite .    localization in highly nonlinear systems can be fundamentally different than localization in linear and weakly nonlinear systems .",
    "in particular , we observe in granular chains a fascinating property ( which is a central result of our study ) : beyond a critical level of disorder , the localization length saturates , so that the wave dynamics remains insensitive to the level of heterogeneity in the chain in this regime .",
    "in addition , the decay of the wave amplitude does not follow an exponential relation but instead follows a power - law relation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_high ] ) , with a power fixed by the type of nonlinear interaction between nearest neighbors in the chain .",
    "this remarkable and unexpected effect arises from the balance between the flux of energy from the leading pulse to the tail of the wave and the flux in the opposite direction .",
    "it results in a stationary wave structure that , combined with an argument based on energy conservation in the chain ( see section [ secc ] ) , suggests the possibility of power - law decay ( in time ) of the wave amplitude for sufficiently high levels of disorder .",
    "how and when this condition of flux balance is achieved still remains to be established .",
    "however , our investigation of the wave behavior in both the low- and high - disorder regimes gives an expression of the critical level @xmath30 of disorder corresponding to the transition from exponential to power - law decay of wave amplitudes [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq_finite ] ) ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that for sufficiently long chains , the system experiences the second type of decay ( because @xmath107 ) .",
    "consequently , this regime is expected to dominate for long times and large system sizes .",
    "we have introduced the concept of elastic spin chains , which we constructed using randomly - oriented arrangements of dimer cells in one - dimensional granular crystals .",
    "we quantified the level @xmath7 of disorder in the chain by counting the number of spins with the same orientation . in order to characterize the wave propagation properties",
    ", we calculated ensemble averages of relevant quantities over different chain configurations with the same value of @xmath7i.e . ,",
    "configurations with the same number of up and down spins",
    ". this allowed us to quantitatively characterize the effect of disorder on the propagation of highly nonlinear pulses . for low levels of disorder , we observed the propagation of a solitary wave with exponentially decaying amplitude .",
    "we observed amplitude decay in time ( as the wave propagates through one defect after another ) .",
    "the `` localization length '' characterizing the exponential amplitude decay in the low - disorder nonlinear setting can be expressed as a function of the level of disorder @xmath7 and the scattering properties of an isolated defect ( i.e. , when one dimer has a different spin from all of the other dimers ) . as a result",
    ", the transmission coefficient through the entire chain decays exponentially with the level of disorder @xmath7 . beyond a critical level of disorder @xmath30 , this transmission coefficient becomes independent of @xmath7 and saturates at a constant value . in this regime ,",
    "in which the wave behavior remains insensitive to the level of disorder , the wave s spatial structure is much more extended .",
    "moreover , the propagation of the wave is no longer governed by the propagation of an isolated solitary wave , as it was the low disorder regime , but it instead resembles a train of smaller waves .",
    "in addition , the decay of the wave amplitude follows a power law instead of an exponential law , with the power fixed by the type of nonlinear interaction between nearest neighbors in the chain .",
    "this effect appears to arise from a balance between the flux of energy going from the leading pulse to the tail of the wave and the flux going in the opposite direction .",
    "how and when this condition of flux balance is achieved remains to be established , and additional studies of localization phenomena in highly nonlinear settings should lead to interesting insights into the dynamics of disordered nonlinear systems .",
