    "<S> we reexamine neutron - proton pairing as a phenomenon that should be explanable in a microscopic theory of nuclear binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> empirically , there is an increased separation energy when both neutron and proton numbers are even or if they are both odd . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement is present at some level in nearly all nuclei : the separation energy difference has the opposite sign in less than 1% of the cases in which sufficient data exist . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible origin of the effect in the context of density functional theory ( dft ) and its extensions . </S>",
    "<S> neutron - proton pairing from the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory does not seem promising to explain the effect . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that much of the increased binding in the odd - odd system might be understood as a recoupling energy . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the dft should be extended by angular momentum projection to describe the effect .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sect : intro ]    it has been known for a long time that the nuclear binding has a mild dependence on the combined even - odd parities of proton and neutron numbers@xcite,@xcite . to see the effect , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fi:1 ] shows the neutron separation energies for nuclei with neutron number @xmath0 as a function of proton number @xmath1 ; the separation energy is expressed in terms of the binding energy as @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the neutron separation energies for even @xmath1 are systematically larger than the average of the separation energies for the neighboring odd-@xmath1 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior is found for proton separation energies @xmath3 in chains of isotopes . in that case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is greater if the number of neutrons is even than when the number of neutrons is odd .    to study this behavior in more detail </S>",
    "<S> , we examine the separation energy differences @xmath4 , defined as the difference between the separation energy and the average for the two neighboring nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this is [ s_2 ] s_n2p = s_n(n , z ) -(s_n(n , z+1)+s_n(n , z-1 ) ) /2 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 for neutrons and protons , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these measures were first introduced by jensen et al . @xcite . with our notation , the usual measure for ordinary pairing </S>",
    "<S> is given by ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * eq . 2 - 92,93 ) ) @xmath6 for the neutron gap , @xmath7 , and similarly @xmath8 gives the proton gap . </S>",
    "<S> most earlier studies of neutron - proton pairing used different measures for the effect . in early fits of the measured binding energies @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the effect was parameterized as @xmath9 and attributed to an enhancement in the neutron - proton interaction . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the parameterization was changed to one have an approximate @xmath10 dependence on nuclear mass number , [ delta ] = k ( n,2 ) ( z,2 ) / a^2/3 . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a 9-point difference formula was proposed to describe a neutron - proton pairing energy . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be compared the 6-point difference formula we use in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention the shell - based mass fits of zeldes@xcite , which invoke a shell - dependent term similar to @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the signs of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are remarkably consistent across the nuclear mass table . </S>",
    "<S> taking the data from the 2003 audi - wapstra mass tables@xcite , there are 1412 nuclei which have values of @xmath12 that are significant , i.e. , have magnitudes larger the accumulated error in the experimental binding energies needed to construct the difference . of these only 10 nuclei had a sign for @xmath12 opposite to that seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fi:1 ] . of the 1448 measured proton separations </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 , only 9 had the opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclei with significant values of @xmath13 for proton separations are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fi:2 ] , with the few opposite - sign cases shown as the black squares .    </S>",
    "<S> the plot for neutron separations is very similar . </S>",
    "<S> there is concentration in the light nuclei near the @xmath14 line , but no obvious pattern elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined the dependence of the magnitude of the separation energy differences on the mass numbers , a , of the nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> there is a great deal of scatter as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fi:3 ] , but the trend is consistent with an @xmath10 dependence as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the heavy line shows a least squares fit to the data , @xmath15 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the values for @xmath16 display a very similar distribution .    finally , we plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fi:4 ] all the measured nuclei , distinguishing by color those whose @xmath17 is larger or smaller than the average trend .    </S>",
    "<S> we also find a very similar pattern for @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> there is no visible dependence on shell closures .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the question of what is responsible for the effect . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced binding could arise by an increased attraction between an odd neutron and an odd proton . </S>",
    "<S> it could also arise by a mechanism that produced an increased binding in a nucleus with even numbers for both protons and neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> there is no way to distinguish these pictures by the observed systematics of the separation energy differences , because even - even and odd - odd binding energies contribute to the separation energy difference with the same weights . </S>",
    "<S> both pictures are consistent with the strong similarity between the proton and neutron separation energy differences . </S>",
    "<S> still , it is important to understand the origin of the effect if one is to construct accurate theories of nuclear binding based on microscopic theories such as the self - consistent mean field theory , also called density functional theory ( dft)@xcite . ordinary pairing between like particles is quite well explained by the bcs or hartree - fock - bogoliubov extension of dft . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests generalizing the hfb theory to allow neutron - proton pairing . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , at the @xmath14 line neutron - proton pairing is on a same footing as like - particle pairing . </S>",
    "<S> also , the neutron - proton interaction is stronger than the like - particle interaction , in free space . </S>",
    "<S> the special effects going on near @xmath14 are often discussed as the  wigner energy \" . </S>",
    "<S> it is usually parameterized in a way that does not exhibit a neutron - proton pairing effect away from the @xmath14 line and we shall consider it irrelevant to explain the effect . </S>",
    "<S> we note again that over half of the opposite - sign cases are near the @xmath14 line </S>",
    "<S> . there have also been limited studies of neutron - proton pairing in the hfb theory  @xcite . typically , away from the @xmath14 line , condensates form in the like - particle sectors and prevent any pairing between neutrons and protons . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore doubt whether the effect can be explained without make some extension of the usual dft+hfb theory .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a possible mechanism that only requires a mild extension of the dft . </S>",
    "<S> that is to exploit the higher degeneracy of states in the odd - odd nucleus to recouple the neutron and proton more favorably . </S>",
    "<S> this is easiest to understand in the situations where the mean - field theory approaches either the spherical shell model or the strongly deformed limit . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , zeldes and liran@xcite may have had this mechanism in mind in their shell - based mass parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> for the shell - model limit , consider even - even nucleus ( n , z ) that has a spherical mean field . </S>",
    "<S> an added neutron goes into a spherical shell @xmath18 with an energy @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , an added proton goes into a shell @xmath20 . when there are both added neutrons and protons , there is an addition neutron - proton interaction energy @xmath21 depending on the angular momentum of the pair @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron separation energies for the nuclei with proton numbers @xmath23 are , respectively ,    @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 in the second equation , @xmath27 denotes the angular momentum of the odd - odd nucleus ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the last equation gives the neutron separation energy for the nucleus with two additional protons . </S>",
    "<S> here the angular momentum coupling is determined by the three - particle wave function . in the spherical shell model , the two protons </S>",
    "<S> are coupled to angular momentum zero in the three - particle wave function @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> standard angular momentum recoupling gives the neutron - proton interaction as @xmath29    thus , in the shell model , the energy of the odd neutron when the proton number is even is the @xmath30-weighted average over the possible neutron - proton couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> this value can be estimated empirically from the spectrum of the odd - odd nuclei as the quantity [ eq : recouple ] _ </S>",
    "<S> s = _ j=|j_n - j_p|^j_n+j_p ( 2 j+1 ) e_j /(2j_n+1)(2j_p+1 ) here @xmath31 are measured excitation energies of the levels of the multiplet in the odd - odd nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath32 is thus a measure of the enhancement of the neutron separation energy for an odd neutron in a nucleus with an odd number of protons .    for most odd - odd nuclei , </S>",
    "<S> the recoupling spectrum is difficult to determine due to the presence of other levels . </S>",
    "<S> however , near doubly magic nuclei it is often possible to make a spectroscopic identification@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some cases where we could plausibly assign the members of the multiplet are shown in table  [ ta:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these results are also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fi:5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the recoupling energy @xmath32 has the same order of magnitude as the separation energy differences , and also varies from case to case in a similar way . however , there is considerable scatter leaving room for other mechanism to have a role .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 & @xmath32 + 21 & 19 & 0.49 & 0.32 & 0.44 + 27 & 21 & 0.39 & 0.53 & 0.70 + 29 & 21 & 0.25 & 0.30 & 0.32 + 29 & 27 & 0.30 & 0.31 & 0.38 + 29 & 29 & 0.81 & 0.78 & 0.65 + 33 & 27 & 0.20 & 0.29 & 0.15 + 81 & 51 & 0.24 & 0.22 & 0.14 + 125 & 83 & 0.03 & 0.03 & 0.06 + 127 & 81 & & 0.15 & 0.04 + 127 & 83 & 0.36 & 0.36 & 0.42 +    if the odd - odd recoupling is dominant to produce the effect , it should be suppressed in deformed nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the coupling of the orbitals to the symmetry axis removes most of the degeneracy . only the @xmath33 quantum number remains , leaving a degeneracy between the two states @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the odd - odd nucleus . to see whether the suppression is indeed present , </S>",
    "<S> we have examined the separation energies differences for strongly deformed even - even nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we took the classification of deformed nuclei from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which used the theoretical criterion that the static deformation of the nucleus be larger than the fluctuations about the minimum . there are 92 nuclei with measured @xmath12 that meet the criterion . </S>",
    "<S> fitting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta ] ) to these nuclei , we find a slightly lower value for @xmath33 , 5.7 mev compared to 7.3 mev . also a larger fraction of the deformed nuclei have very small values of the separation energy differences : 23% of the deformed nuclei have @xmath12 less than @xmath36 mev versus 9% for the other nuclei . the difference is not very large , suggesting that other mechanism beyond the recoupling effect may be needed . for example , configuration mixing arising from the neutron - proton interaction might depend on whether those nucleons are part of a pairing condensate or not . </S>",
    "<S> such a mechanism would be beyond the usual dft . </S>"
