    "it is well - known that the equations describing gravitation with a given background metric coincide with the einstein ones if the background metric satisfies the `` background '' einstein equations @xcite .",
    "however , if the background metric is arbitrary , the gravitational equations differ from the einstein equations",
    ". some exact solutions of these equations which are in form very close to the einstein solutions acquire new specific features .",
    "there are at least two reasons for these solutions to be interesting .",
    "first , they are solutions of the einstein equations on the nontrivial cosmological background .",
    "that is why they may be physically meaningful in the early universe .",
    "when the quantum properties of gravity were important , the einstein theory was to be replaced by the effective theory that includes quantum effects .",
    "later on , gravitation was described by the einstein equations .",
    "however , the intermediate period between quantum and einstein states may admit the description in terms of the einstein gravity on the quantum - corrected background .",
    "solutions on the nontrivial background may be useful for the functional integral approach to quantum gravity . in the semiclassical approximation",
    ", the dominant contribution to the path integral will come from the neighborhood of saddle points of the action , that is , of classical solutions .",
    "it seems to be interesting to compare the path integral based on the gibbos - hawking action with another model , whose properties may be different .    of course , we can write down any metric which does not satisfy any equations . however , to derive the lagrangian is a more complicated problem .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 is the only scalar without essential higher derivatives .",
    "all other lagrangians contain either higher derivatives or additional dynamical degrees of freedom .    introducing a nondynamical background object",
    ", we can derive solutions with very different properties and , at the same time , retain the basic structure of the lagrangian .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the gravitation described by the spherically symmetric static metric @xmath1 on the background @abcabctruetmp = currentlabel= @xmath2    where @xmath3 . the spatial sections @xmath4 are 3-d lobachevski spaces ( a constant negative curvature space of radius @xmath5 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we use the system of units @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to shift a coordinate @xmath7 to some value @xmath8 so that ( [ 1a ] ) takes the form @abcabctruetmp = currentlabel= @xmath9 @abc    the equations @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the background ricci tensor , @xmath12 is the energy - momentum tensor of the external matter , are derived from the action @xmath13 with the rosen @xcite gravitational lagrangian @xmath14 here the affine - deformation tensor @xmath15 is the difference between the background connection and the levi - chivita connection for physical metric .",
    "the matter lagrangian @xmath16 does not contain background objects .",
    "we will investigate the vacuum ( [ 5 ] ) and charged ( [ 8 ] ) spherically symmetric static solutions of equations ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "both the cases contain two branches .",
    "the first branches ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) transform into the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions if we put @xmath17 . the second branches ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) describe wormholes and have no einstein limit ( they diverge when @xmath17 )",
    ".    a charged wormhole can contain an event horizon and the cauchy horizon in the throat .",
    "then structure of the whole geodesic space - time is similar to the kerr solution .",
    "it is interesting that the corresponding black holes have a positive heat capacity .",
    "equations ( [ 2 ] ) on the background ( [ 1 ] ) were considered for a localized mass @xcite and the electric charge @xcite .",
    "if we put @xmath17 , the metric ( [ 1 ] ) goes over to the minkowski metric , and equations ( [ 2 ] ) turne into the einstein equations .",
    "arbitrary spherically symmetric static metric may be written in the form @xmath18 the causal structure of space - time is determined by the metric function @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the `` luminosity '' distance .",
    "it may be shown that , if @xmath20 is an increasing function , the decreasing function @xmath19 describes repulsion of a test body from the central source ; while increasing @xmath19 , attraction .",
    "let us denote @xmath21 first of all we consider the vacuum case @xmath22 : @xmath23    besides the solution @xmath24 transforming to the schwarzschild solution when @xmath17 there is the second solution of ( [ 5 ] ) @xmath25 describing traversible wormhole .",
    "this second branch demands nontrivial background topology continued to negative @xmath7 .",
    "the solution ( [ 6 ] ) was found in @xcite .",
    "it contains a schwarzschild - like singularity on the event horizon at @xmath26 . the metric function and the luminosity distance",
    "are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we may find the coordinate system in which ( [ 6 ] ) is regular at @xmath26 but in these coordinates there is the background metric ( [ 1 ] ) singularity . since the background metric is non - observable , we are interested only in the physical metric ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "the causal structure of maximal analytic extension ( [ 6 ] ) is the same as the schwarzschild one .",
    "note that if @xmath27 , the value of @xmath8 is very close to the value of mass of the central source .",
    "if @xmath28 , then ( [ 6 ] ) goes over to the background metric ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the asymptotics of ( [ 6 ] ) for @xmath29 coincides with the asymptotics of ( [ 1b ] ) .",
    "the metric function of ( [ 7 ] ) is regular at all @xmath7 and the luminosity distance has a minimum at @xmath30 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "it means that if @xmath7 is smaller than @xmath8 , the metric ( [ 7 ] ) describes a traversible wormhole .",
    "the locally defined background ( [ 1 ] ) derives locally the physical metric ( [ 7 ] ) by means of equations ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the geodesic completeness of ( [ 7 ] ) leads to the topology both of background and physical metrics .",
    "solution ( [ 7 ] ) diverges if @xmath17 because the minimum of @xmath31 goes to @xmath32 .",
    "asymptotics of ( [ 7 ] ) for @xmath29 is the same as that of ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 1b ] ) but if @xmath33 , the metric ( [ 7 ] ) turns to the metric @xmath34 describing a symmetric wormhole in the absolute empty space .",
    "if @xmath35 , the asymptotics of the physical metric for @xmath36 differs from the background one . it can be shown that the wormhole sucks in a matter from the 3-space with a nonbackground asymptotics and then throws out it into the 3-space whose asymptotics is the same as the background one .",
    "however , a rapidly moving radial observer can visit another 3-space and then return to his home during a finite proper time .",
    "now let us consider equations ( [ 2 ] ) with the energy - momentum tensor of a localized electric charge @xmath37 : @xmath38 here we also obtain two branches .",
    "the first @xmath39 where @xmath40 was found in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath41 , it passes into the reissner - nordstrm solution . if @xmath42 , then ( [ 9 ] ) coincides with ( [ 6 ] )",
    "if @xmath43 , where @xmath44 there are two horizons at @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47    when @xmath48 , horizons are absent . if @xmath49 , the horizons merge into a single horizon at @xmath50 and an extreme black hole forms .",
    "the second branch @xmath51 where @xmath52 should be interpreted similarly to the metric ( [ 7 ] ) .    if @xmath42 , then ( [ 9 ] ) coincides with ( [ 7 ] ) . if @xmath53 , where @xmath54 metric ( [ 12 ] ) describes the traversible wormhole .",
    "if @xmath55 , there is a horizon in the throat . when @xmath48 , there are two horizons at @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 note that from ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) we have @xmath59 since @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 . because in ( [ 9 ] ) a horizon exists if @xmath43 , and in (",
    "[ 12 ] ) it exists if @xmath62 , for any @xmath8 there is an area of @xmath37 in which there are horizons neither in ( [ 9 ] ) nor in ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "now we return to solution ( [ 12 ] ) .    when @xmath63 , horizons depend on @xmath8 as shown in fig.[fig3 ] . if @xmath64 , for small enough @xmath8 a horizon is absent . if @xmath65 , then even for @xmath66 there are two horizons at @xmath67 ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .    when there are two horizons , the causal structure of ( [ 12 ] ) is similar to the kerr solution but without singularity .",
    "the conformal diagram is shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "temperature of the solutions with horizons can be found by investigating the euclidean sections of the corresponding metrics @xcite .",
    "for ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) the corresponding temperatures are @xmath68    the dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath8 is very close to the dependence of @xmath70 , if @xmath8 is not very small .",
    "if @xmath17 , then ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) pass into expressions for temperatures of the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solution , respectively .",
    "when @xmath28 , then @xmath71 as the schwarzschild temperature .",
    "the behavior of @xmath70 is similar , but when @xmath8 is very small , then for any ( small ) @xmath37 the horizon does not form , and at @xmath49 the temperature @xmath72 .",
    "that is why for any @xmath73 there is a neighborhood of @xmath74 for @xmath8 in which @xmath70 and @xmath69 depend on @xmath8 as shown in fig.[fig6 ] .    for large @xmath8",
    "the situation differs from the gr one : @xmath75 it means that very heavy black holes ca nt have temperature less than @xmath76 .",
    "the solution ( [ 12 ] ) has two temperatures . in the 3-space when @xmath56 is the event horizon and @xmath57 is the cauchy horizon , we observe the temperature @xmath77 and in the 3-space ,",
    "when @xmath57 is the event horizon and @xmath56 is the cauchy horizon , we observe the temperature @xmath78 these temperatures are increasing functions of @xmath8 !",
    "therefore , the heat capacity of ( [ 12 ] ) is positive definit , and so we can use a normal canonical ensemble . the lower limit for both the temperatures is equal to @xmath79 the maximal value of @xmath80 is @xmath76 , and the maximal value of @xmath81 is @xmath82 from ( [ 19 ] ) we can see that for @xmath83 the minimal of temperature is zero , and if @xmath65 , then the minimal temperature is large than zero .",
    "when @xmath64 , then horizons will form only if @xmath8 is not very small , and the lower temperature corresponds to the minimal value of @xmath8 obtained from ( [ 13 ] ) : @xmath84",
    "let us consider the common metric ( [ 4 ] ) and go to the coordinates @xmath85 : @xmath86 if @xmath87 , that is @xmath88 then @xmath89 and@xmath90 are null coordinates and the metric ( [ 4 ] ) takes the form @xmath91 we are interested in the case when @xmath92 , so , @xmath93    at a horizon we have @xmath94 . to avoid this peculiarity , we can attempt to perform the coordinate transformation @xmath95 so that @xmath96 if @xmath97 at a horizon has the same peculiarity as @xmath19 , then the metric ( [ 23 ] ) becomes regular .    for the metric ( [ 6 ] ) we have @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "in the coordinates @xmath100 we get the metric([6 ] ) in the form ( [ 23 ] ) : @xmath101 . the conformal diagram constructed similarly to the schwarzschild one .",
    "although the coordinate @xmath7 in ( [ 1b ] ) changes only in the area @xmath102 , we can formally consider continuation of the functions @xmath103 and @xmath20 onto all the real numbers @xmath104 .",
    "now let us consider the solution ( [ 7 ] ) .    as we can see from fig.[fig2 ] , the metric ( [ 7 ] ) describes gravitational repulsion if @xmath105 . the space - time described by ( [ 7 ] ) is regular at all @xmath7 .",
    "test particles can cross the sphere @xmath30 and reach negative values of @xmath7 .",
    "actually , ( [ 7 ] ) contains the traversible wormhole at @xmath30 connecting two infinitely 3-spaces @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for this interpretation",
    ", we must extend the background ( [ 1b ] ) to the area @xmath106 ( or ( [ 1a ] ) to @xmath108 ) and consider the background space as two the lobachevsky spaces glued at @xmath30 .    on this background , the solution ( [ 7 ] ) of equations ( [ 5 ] )",
    "is defined at @xmath109 . for investigation of the region with @xmath106 , we can do the following coordinate and constant transformations : @xmath110 note that @xmath111 .",
    "the metric ( [ 7 ] ) takes the form @xmath112 where @xmath113    asymptotics ( [ 26 ] ) for @xmath114 coincides with the asymptotics of the lobachevski space with radius @xmath115 . to make this clear",
    ", we should pass to the coordinate @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath117 , the metric ( [ 26 ] ) describes gravitational attraction . in fig.[fig8",
    "] it is shown conditional representation of the space - time of the wormhole . in fig.[fig8 ] we can see the embedding diagram which is two dimensional model of the spatial section at a specific moment of time , embedded into a fictitious 3 - dimensional space .",
    "note that the background topology differs from the physical one .",
    "a continuous line in the background space corresponds to the discontinuity of the physical line at @xmath50 . to avoid this phenomenon",
    ", we should further change the background topology and consider the background 3-space as a limit when @xmath118 of two spatial sections ( [ 1b ] ) glued on the sphere @xmath119 ( fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "equations of geodesics can be obtained from the lagrangian @xmath120 where @xmath121 means @xmath122 and @xmath123 is a proper time @xcite . for radial geodesics in the metric ( [ 4 ] )",
    "this lagrangian takes the form @xmath124 the euler equation for ( [ 27 ] ) is @xmath125 from this formula we get @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is a constant of motion .",
    "let us substitute it into ( [ 27 ] ) and take into account that @xmath128 .",
    "we obtain @xmath129 where @xmath130 .",
    "consequently , the proper time of radial motion from the point with coordinate @xmath131 to the point with coordinate @xmath132 is @xmath133 since direction of motion is towards the center we have for @xmath134 that @xmath135 .",
    "finally , the proper time of radial motion from @xmath131 to @xmath132 is @xmath136    let us consider a free falling body in the metric ( [ 9 ] ) with the parabolic velocity @xmath137 . from ( [ 28 ] ) we get @xmath138 let @xmath139 from([29 ] ) we obtain the proper time of free fall from @xmath140 to @xmath141 : @xmath142 from ( [ 30 ] ) we can see that @xmath143 diverges when @xmath144 but it is finite for any other @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "now let us consider the fall in metric ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "in this case we can not assume @xmath147 when @xmath29 because test bodies are repulsed by the center .",
    "that is why we put @xmath148 at @xmath149 : @xmath150 from([29 ] ) we obtain the proper time of free fall from @xmath140 to @xmath141 : @xmath151 where @xmath152 it is clear from ( [ 31 ] ) that @xmath143 is finite for all finite @xmath145 and @xmath146 and diverges both for @xmath144 ( @xmath153 ) and for @xmath154 ( the first term in the brackets ) .",

    "we can not obtain the temperature @xmath81 by substituting @xmath173 instead of @xmath171 into ( [ 43 ] ) because in domain iii @xmath173 is not the event horizon , it is the cauchy horizon .",

    "within the context of a spherically symmetric model in the presence of a nontrivial background we have investigated some exact solutions of gravitation equations .",
    "we have found that there are two branches of the solutions .",
    "the first branch is close to the corresponding solution of the einstein equation , and the second has a set of nontrivial properties and diverges if the background passes into the minkovski space .      in principle , this toy model may be considered as a very anisotropic cosmological model , in which both local and global properties are described by the gravitational field produced by the central - symmetric solution .",
    "let us suppose that the einstein cylinder is actually a throat of the wormhole with cosmological radius . if the metric is such that the test bodies are attracted by the throat from one side and repulsed from another , then it is clear that close to the minimal radius , the local metric appears to be nonstationary for a free falling observer .",
    "such a model is impossible in the framework of the conventional general relativity because the violation of energy conditions is necessary for the wormhole creation @xcite .",
    "if we consider the gravitation on the nontrivial cosmological background , similar solutions can appear .",
    "much attention has been paid to the investigation of wormholes .",
    "classical wormholes usually are euclidean metrics which consist of two large regions of spacetime connected by a throat .",
    "they play an important role in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it was just the microscopic wormholes which have a planck size throat .",
