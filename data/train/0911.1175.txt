    "as the standard model has been established in current experiments , the appearance of new physics now attracts growing interests especially in the light of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "so far various extensions of the standard model with their own motivations have been investigated for new physics , including exotic fermions , extra higgs fields , extended gauge interactions , supersymmetry , and so on .",
    "the new physics might already provide some significant effects in the low - energy particle phenomena such as flavor - changing processes .",
    "it is now expected seriously that the new physics will reveal itself in the lhc experiments .    among many intriguing extensions of the standard model",
    ", we here investigate the new physics provided by isosinglet quarks , which are suggested in certain models such as @xmath7-type unification @xcite .",
    "specifically , there are two types of singlet quarks , @xmath8 with electric charge @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 , which may mix with the ordinary quarks .",
    "it is also reasonable to incorporate a singlet higgs field @xmath12 , which provides the singlet quark masses and the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing between the ordinary quarks ( @xmath13 ) and the singlet quarks ( @xmath14 ) . in this sort of model",
    "various novel features arise through the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing @xcite .",
    "the unitarity of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix within the ordinary quark sector is violated , and the flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) appear at the tree - level .",
    "these flavor - changing interactions are described appropriately in terms of the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing parameters and quark masses @xcite .",
    "then , the actual ckm mixing is reproduced up to the small unitarity violation provided the fcnc s are suppressed sufficiently with the small @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing . in this respect",
    "the presence of singlet quarks may introduce an interesting extension of the notion of natural flavor conservation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the new @xmath15-violating phases in @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing may provide significant contributions especially in the @xmath16 meson physics @xcite .",
    "it is also expected in cosmology that the singlet quarks and singlet higgs field may play important roles in the early universe .",
    "specifically , in the first - order electroweak phase transition the @xmath15-violating @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing via the coupling with the complex singlet higgs @xmath12 can be efficient to produce the chiral charge fluxes through the bubble wall for the baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of singlet higgs field is preferable for realizing the strong enough first - order electroweak phase transition .    as mentioned in the above ,",
    "the singlet quarks and singlet higgs bring various intriguing features in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "it is hence worth considering their phenomenological implications toward the discovery of them at the lhc @xcite . in this study",
    "we investigate the flavor - changing interactions in the presence of singlet quarks and singlet higgs .",
