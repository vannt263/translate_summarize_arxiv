    "some time ago monopoles in einstein - yang - mills - higgs(eymh ) model , for @xmath2 gauge group with higgs field in adjoint representation , were studied as a generalization of the t hooft - ployakov monopole to see the effect of gravity on it . in particular , it was found that solutions exist up to some critical value of a dimensionless parameter @xmath1 , characterising the strength of the gravitational interaction , above which there is no regular solution .",
    "the existance of these solutions were also proved analytically for the case of infinite higgs mass .",
    "also , non abelian magnetically charged black hole solutions were shown to exist in this model for both finite as well as infinite value of the coupling constant for higgs field .",
    "the abelian black holes exists for @xmath3 and non abelian black holes exist in a limited region of the @xmath4 plane .",
    "recently born - infeld theory has received wide publicity , especially in the context of string theory .",
    "bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) saturated solutions were obtained in abelian higgs model as well as in @xmath5 sigma model in @xmath6 dimensions in presence of born - infeld term .",
    "different models for domain wall , vortex and monopole solutions , containing the born - infeld lagrangian were constructed in such a way that the self - dual equations are identical with the corresponding yang - mills - higgs model .",
    "recently non self - dual monopole solutions were found numerically in non abelian born - infeld - higgs theory .    in this paper",
    "we consider the einstein - born - infeld - higgs(ebih ) model and study the monopole and black hole solutions .",
    "the solutions are qualitatively similar to those of eymh model .",
    "the black hole configurations have nonzero non abelian field strength and hence they are called non abelian black holes . in sec .",

    "we find the asymptotic behaviours and discuss the numerical results .",

    "we consider the following einstein - born - infeld - higgs action for @xmath2 fields with the higgs field in the adjoint representation    s = d^4x with l_g & = & , + l_h & = & - d_^a d^^a -(^a^a - v^2 ) ^2 and the non abelian born - infeld lagrangian , l_bi = ^2 str ( 1 - ) where d_^a = _",

    "for static spherical symmetric solutions , the metric can be parametrized as    ds^2 = -e ^2(r)dt^2 + e ^2(r)dr^2 + r^2(r)(d^2 + ^2d^2 ) and we consider the following ansatz for the gauge and scalar fields    a_t^a(r ) = 0 = a_r^a , a_^a = e_^a , a_^a = -e_^a , and ^a = e_r^a v h(r ) . putting the above ansatz in eq.1 , defining @xmath11 and rescaling @xmath12 and @xmath13 we get the following expression for the lagrangian dr e^+ , where v_1 = ( w)^2 + r^2(h)^2 - ( w)^2 , v_2 = and v_3 = + w^2h^2 + ( h^2 - 1)^2 - . here",
    "the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 can be expressed as the mass ratio = with the gauge field mass @xmath15 and the planck mass @xmath16 .",
    "note that the higgs mass @xmath17 . in the limit of @xmath18 the above action reduces to that of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs model .",
    "for the case of @xmath19 we must have @xmath20 which corresponds to the flat space born - infeld - higgs theory .",
    "we now consider the gauge @xmath21 , corresponding to the schwarzschild - like coordinates and rename @xmath22 .",
    "we define @xmath23 and @xmath24 . varying the matter field lagrangian with respect to the metric we find the energy - momentum tensor . integrating the @xmath25 component of the energy - momentum",
    "we get the mass of the monopole equal to @xmath26 where m = ^2 _ 0^ dr ( nv_1 - n^2v_2 + v_3 )    following t hooft the electromagnetic @xmath27 field strength @xmath28 can be defined as _ = - ^abc^ad_^bd_^c .",
    "then using the ansatz(3 ) the magnetic field b^i = ^ijkf_jk is equal to @xmath29 with a total flux @xmath30 and unit magnetic charge .",

    "( 11),(13 ) and ( 14 ) for the three fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "for finite @xmath35 , demanding the solutions to be regular and the monopole mass to be finite gives the following behaviour near the origin & & h = a r + o(r^3 ) , + & & w = 1 - b r^2 + o(r^4 ) , + & & n = 1 - c r^2 + o(r^4 ) , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are free parameters and @xmath38 is given by c = ^2 ( a^2 + 4b^2 + - ) .",
    "in general , with these initial conditions @xmath39 can be zero at some finite @xmath40 where the solutions become singular . in order to avoid this singularity we have to adjust the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 suitably .    for @xmath41",
    "we require the solutions to be asymptotically flat .",
    "hence we impose n = 1 - then for finite mass configuration we have the following expressions for the gauge and the higgs fields & & w = c r^-m e^-r(1 + o ( ) ) + & & h = \\ {    ll 1 - b r^-gm - 1 e^-gr , & for   0 < g + 1 - r^-2m-2 e^-2r , & for   g = 0   and g > .    .",

    "we have solved the equations of motion numerically with the boundary conditions given by eqs.(16 - 21 ) . for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath18",
    "they corresponds to the exact prasad - sommerfield solution .",
    "for nonzero @xmath44 and finite @xmath45 the qualitative behaviour of the solutions are similar to the corresponding solutions of eymh model . for large @xmath40",
    "these solutions converges to their asymptotic values given as in eqs.(19 - 21 ) . for a fixed value of @xmath35 and @xmath45 we solved the equations increasing the value of @xmath1 . for small value of @xmath1 the solutions",
    "are very close to flat space solution . as @xmath1",
    "is increased the minimum of the metric function @xmath39 was found to be decreasing .",
