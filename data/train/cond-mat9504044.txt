    "in the last years , the kinetics of aggregation has been widely studied @xcite .",
    "it has been studied experimentally in a large number of systems like aqueous metal colloids @xcite , silicon tetramethoxyde @xcite and tetraethoxyde @xcite , alumino - silcates @xcite , colloidal silica @xcite , polystyrene @xcite , and oil in water emulsions @xcite . using small - angle scattering techniques",
    "it has been suggested that some of these systems @xcite grow like diffusion - limited cluster - cluster aggregation ( dlca ) @xcite .",
    "numerically , the gelation process in dlca has been investigated by analyzing the cluster size distribution and the mean cluster size , as a function of the time @xmath11 using both the smoluchowski equation @xcite and the dlca model in 2 dimensions @xcite . on the other hand , recently @xcite it has been shown that , when the volumic fraction @xmath4 , or concentration , is greater than a characteristic gel concentration @xmath12 , dlca model leads to a homogeneous gelling network of connected fractal clusters of mean size @xmath2 .",
    "in some systems @xcite where fractal clusters grow separately until obtaining a system of connected fractal clusters at large @xmath11 , the wave - vector - dependent scattering function @xmath1 exhibits a maximum in the wave vector @xmath7-value ( which is inversely proportional to @xmath2 ) at a given time @xmath11 .",
    "this maximum can be interpreted as a crossover between the fractal regime ( intermediate @xmath13-values where @xmath14 ) and the homogeneous regime ( small @xmath13-values ) . moreover ,",
    "some very interesting relations on the @xmath15 curve ( see below equations 7 ) have been established on various systems @xcite . since scaling relation",
    "are known to be of wide applications ( `` universality '' ) it is worth studying them here .",
    "another interesting experimental results @xcite reveal that the gyration radius @xmath16 ( which is proportional to @xmath2 ) saturates close to @xmath3 , the time where the system can be considered as a gelling network .    in this paper , we present some new results obtained from our numerical study of the gelation process using diffusion limited cluster - cluster aggregation in a box @xcite , where a sufficiently large initial concentration has been considered in order to obtain a gelling network of connected clusters at the end of the aggregation process .",
    "we have calculated numerically the mean number of particles per cluster @xmath10 and their mean size @xmath2 as a function of time @xmath11 as well as the correlation function @xmath0 , and the scattering function @xmath1 .",
    "we show that there exists a crossover at @xmath3 such that , for @xmath6 , @xmath2 increases when @xmath11 increases , and for @xmath17 , the characteristic length @xmath2 remains constant and equal to its value obtained near @xmath3 .",
    "the location of this crossover is pushed toward the low-@xmath11 values when @xmath4 increases . for @xmath18",
    "the normalized gel time @xmath19 does not change .",
    "additionally , the maximum of the @xmath1 curve , @xmath20 , increases as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an apparent fractal dimension .",
    "we report on the discrepancies between the actual fractal dimension @xmath9 and @xmath22 for large @xmath4-values .",
    "finally , we discuss the qualitative agreement between our simulations and some experiments .",
    "we have modelized the gelation process considering a three dimensional off - lattice extension of the original diffusion cluster - cluster aggregation model @xcite as in ref .",
    "@xcite where we have shown that such a model is well adapted to describe the aerogel structure . during the aggregation process , we can naturally define a `` monte - carlo '' time @xmath23 which is increased by an arbitrary constant amount @xmath24 at each iteration .",
    "due to the use of formula ( 3 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite to choose the aggregates , the actual `` physical '' time @xmath11 should be increased by the amount @xmath25 related to @xmath26 by : @xmath27 in our calculation the time unit has been arbitrarily fixed by setting @xmath28 .    using scaling arguments",
    ", it can be established that the whole system remains invariant if length , mass and time are conveniently rescaled simultaneously @xcite . changing the average mass @xmath10 by a factor @xmath29",
    ", the distance should be rescaled by @xmath30 and , using a general mean - field argument to evaluate the average time it takes for all clusters to pair up , the time should be rescaled by @xmath31 , giving :    @xmath32    with @xmath33    for @xmath34 and @xmath35 this reasoning gives @xmath36 . in figure 1",
    "we show the time evolution of the mean number of particles per cluster @xmath10 for three different concentrations . when @xmath37 @xmath10 is roughly proportional to @xmath11 as expected from equation ( 2 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath38 this dependence is only observed at short times ( for @xmath39 ) . at large times ( for @xmath40 ) if one still assumes @xmath41 , one should consider a very large exponent @xmath42 .",
    "note that in refs .",
    "@xcite , equation ( 2 ) was obtained under the hypothesis that the entire system remains space and time scaling invariant .",
    "this hypothesis is no longer valid when a gel is formed since the system becomes homogeneous for distances larger than @xmath2 @xcite and if one tries to define its global fractal dimension it should be taken as the dimension of space . qualitatively , the observed increase of @xmath43 can be understood as a consequence of the increase of the fractal dimension .",
    "an earlier work by gonzalez @xcite suggests the same conclusion . in his paper",
    "it is shown that when @xmath9 increases from 1.87 to 2.05 , @xmath43 increases from 1.3 to 2.5 when using a cluster - cluster aggregation model with a sticking probability @xmath44 varying from 0.5 to 0.005 , reaching the chemically - limited cluster - cluster aggregation ( clca ) model @xcite , also called reaction - limited cluster - cluster aggregation ( rlca ) @xcite .",
    "an increasing @xmath43-value with @xmath9 was also found in another clca model also recently proposed by gonzalez @xcite .",
    "the distance that a cluster must travel before colliding with another cluster decreases when @xmath4 increases so that both the gel time @xmath3 , when it exists ( i. e. for @xmath45 ) , and the time at the end of the aggregation process @xmath46 should decrease as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this is well observed in figure 2 where @xmath3 and @xmath46 have been plotted as a function of @xmath4 in a log - log plot . for @xmath47",
    "we observe that @xmath46 is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath4 while , for @xmath45 , both @xmath3 and @xmath46 decrease roughly as @xmath48 ( @xmath12 is determined as explained in ref .",
    "the latter result can be simply understood if one assumes that when @xmath45 the scaling relation ( 2 ) holds up to @xmath49 where the system is made of clusters of mean size @xmath2 containing @xmath50 particles .",
    "the concentration being related to @xmath2 by @xmath51 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the relation ( 2 ) with @xmath52 gives : @xmath53    the observed exponent of -1.75 corresponds to @xmath54 a value larger but quite close to the expected value of the fractal dimension of dlca clusters .",
    "we point out that in our model @xmath12 decreases as @xmath55 as showed elsewhere @xcite , and from equation ( 3 ) one can deduce that @xmath56 when @xmath57 . from figure 2",
    "we also find that the ratio @xmath19 is almost independent on @xmath4 , for @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that the time taken by smaller clusters to stick to the gelling network remains a finite fraction of the total time .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath0 can be calculated by choosing a given path @xmath58 , and calculating the number @xmath59 of interparticle distances lying between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , taking care of the periodic boundary conditions when investigating regions outside of the box . in order to normalize @xmath0 to unity",
    "when r tends to infinity , @xmath0 was defined as follows :    @xmath62    the static structure factor , or scattering function , @xmath1 in a system containing identical particles with mean volume fraction @xmath4 is given by @xcite :    @xmath63    in theory one should take @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "but , as explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite we have calculated @xmath66 from the formula : @xmath67    which gives a @xmath66 value very close to one that insures that @xmath68 when @xmath69 . on the other hand , @xmath70 was chosen equal to @xmath71 , to avoid boundary artifacts due to the periodic boundary conditions considered in our problem .",
    "using equation ( 4 ) , we have calculated @xmath0 at all times @xmath11 during the aggregation process ; we have observed that all the @xmath0 curves exhibit a delta peak at @xmath72 , a discontinuity at @xmath73 and a minimum at @xmath74 , that correspond to the typical short and long range features of dlca aggregates @xcite . in figure 3",
    "we have plotted several @xmath0 curves for @xmath75 at four different @xmath11 emphasizing the region near the minimum in order to show that its location ( which defines the characteristic size @xmath2 of the aggregates ) is shifted to higher @xmath60-values when @xmath11 increases .",
    "the function @xmath0 was averaged up to 20 independent simulations , and the box size @xmath5 was taken equal to 103 .    figure 4 shows @xmath2 as function of @xmath76 for four different values of @xmath4 . from equation ( 2 ) , one expects that @xmath2 should increase as @xmath77 for @xmath6 .",
    "however , for concentrations close to @xmath12 this power law is only verified for @xmath78 . for @xmath11 smaller than but close to @xmath3 one observes a crossover regime with a smaller slope which extends down to smaller times when @xmath4 is smaller",
    ". this smaller slope might be due to the interpenetration of clusters which becomes important as @xmath11 approaches @xmath3 .",
    "the cluster size @xmath2 saturates for @xmath17 suggesting that , in this regime , the remaining free small clusters diffuse towards the gelling network on which they stick without changing the mean size of the large connected clusters .",
    "however , during this regime , the density of clusters increases and therefore their fractal dimension should become larger .",
    "this can be checked in figure 5 where we have plotted the fractal dimension @xmath9 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the upper curve ( open squares ) correspond to the  true  fractal dimension , i.e. the one estimated in real space from the power law behavior @xmath79 , for @xmath80 .    in figure 6",
    "we show typical @xmath1 curves at different times .",
    "these curves exhibit the three regimes explained elsewhere @xcite , damped oscillations at large @xmath13-values @xmath81 , a power law @xmath14 at the intermediate @xmath13-values , and a vanishing regime for @xmath82 . in this figure",
    "we clearly see that @xmath7 is shifted to lower @xmath13-values as @xmath11 increases .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of figure 4 if one considers that @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath83 ( as found for @xmath84 in ref .",
    "additionally , it has been shown @xcite that the scaled scattering function @xmath85 and the position of the peak @xmath7 are related by : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a time - independent scaling function . in spinodal decomposition @xmath88 , while in other growth problems @xmath89 @xcite . in our case ,",
    "as showed in inset in figure 6 , the best collapse is obtained with @xmath90 which roughly corresponds to our previous estimate of the fractal dimension .",
    "also , this scaling behavior can be deduced by considering that the maximum of the scattering function @xmath20 is roughly proportional to the mean number of particles per cluster @xcite :    @xmath91    implying : @xmath92    in figure 7 we show a log - log plot of @xmath93 versus @xmath20 . for convenience",
    "we have reported the results for @xmath94 by estimating @xmath2 from the minimum of @xmath0 since in such estimation the errors are smaller than estimating @xmath7 directly from @xmath1 . as expected from equation ( 7b ) a quasi linear behavior",
    "is found for the four concentrations reported in the figure . by performing a linear regression",
    "we have estimated the exponents of ( 7b ) which have been reported in table i together with the related fractal dimension that we call @xmath95 . in this table",
    "we have also reported the values @xmath22 obtained from the slopes of the respective @xmath1 curves at the last stage of the aggregation process as well as the actual fractal dimension @xmath9 obtained from @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown that , while @xmath9 increases , @xmath95 and @xmath22 decrease when @xmath4 increases , as already seen on figure 5 . similar discrepancies between @xmath9 and @xmath22 were observed by amar et al .",
    "@xcite in a sub - monolayer molecular beam epitaxy model in which the aggregation regime was described by a system of connected fractal clusters .",
    "these discrepancies between @xmath9 and @xmath22 might be explained by the fact that for @xmath96 the single scattering theory considered here is not completely justified@xcite .",
    "note that , for @xmath45 one has @xmath97 for distances larger than @xmath2 , while for @xmath98 the final system is a single fractal aggregate , with @xmath99 as showed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in this section we would like to discuss our results in comparison with several experiments",
    ". small - angle neutron - scattering ( sans ) experiments in the sol - gel process of alumino - silicates have been performed by pouxviel et al .",
    "@xcite showing that the radius of gyration @xmath16 saturates when @xmath11 approaches @xmath3 ( see figure 2 of ref .",
    "these authors have considered three different composition samples prepared under basic conditions and they obtained a fractal dimension @xmath100 as in the dlca case . therefore ,",
    "their results are in agreement with our numerical simulations .",
    "another interesting study has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where small - angle light - scattering experiments have been performed on polystyrene spheres diluted in a water - heavy - water mixture ; it has been shown that @xmath101 scale as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is equal to -0.58 ( close to the exponent reported in table i ) , at early stage of the growth process , and at larger @xmath11 values it has been found that @xmath103 becomes close to ( -1/3 ) the typical value for spinodal decomposition .",
    "they conclude that at early stage of spinodal decomposition the growth is dominated by dlca",
    ". similar kind of analysis has been recently done by hobbie et al.@xcite concerning sans experiments in a hydrogen - bonded polymer blend .",
    "but in their experiments they found @xmath104 a value consistent with diffusion limited particle - cluster aggregation @xcite .",
    "other interesting results have been reported by bibette et al .",
    "they have performed small angle light scattering experiments in monodisperse droplets of water emulsions in oil . they have suggested that the emulsion growth is like diffusion - limited cluster - cluster aggregation , obtaining @xmath100 .",
    "we have extracted the @xmath105 points from their curves of figure 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , that we have compared with the points obtained from our simulation when using the same @xmath4 value as in the experiments ( @xmath75 ) . in figure 8 we show the good agreement with the experiments , obtaining the same increasing behavior of @xmath105 as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "in conclusion , in this work we have shown that numerical simulations of dlca model in a box can account for the growth process of several experimental systems . on the other hand ,",
    "our numerical calculation of @xmath1 during the dlca process is an original investigation that extends previous numerical analysis of this growth process @xcite , leading to the theoretical explanation of additional interesting properties during the aggregation process and confirming some predictions made in some experimental studies .",
    "in particular the power law given in equation ( 7b ) and the shape of our @xmath1 curves are experimentally observed .",
    "similar calculations with the clca model are in progress in order to interpret some experiments which are more likely explained by such kind of growth process .",
    ".for four concentrations considered in the simulations , we have reported the respective exponents ( @xmath106 ) from equation ( 7b ) and the related fractal dimensions @xmath95 , which is compared with the apparent fractal dimension @xmath22 measured from the slope of the @xmath1 curve and the `` true '' fractal dimension @xmath9 as deduced from @xmath0 .",
