    ", fese possesses the simplest structure but exhibits many fantastic properties . with external pressure , the t@xmath3 of bulk fese jumps from 8 k to 37 k@xcite",
    "recently , the monolayer fese grown by molecular beam epitaxy on srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surface shows a record t@xmath3 of 65 k@xcite .",
    "many experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to the fese on sto ( 001 ) surface@xcite .",
    "the origin of high t@xmath3 in the above systems is still under debate .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling may help magnetic interactions to give an enhancement of t@xmath3@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the non - superconducting multilayer fese films can become superconduting with k deposition , which clearly indicates that electron doping is prerequisite for achieving high t@xmath3@xcite .",
    "very recently , monolayer fese has been successfully grown on the srtio@xmath0 ( 110 ) surface and the onset t@xmath3 of 31.6 k and a superconducting gap of 16 mev have been reported@xcite . compared with sto ( 001 ) surface ,",
    "the sto ( 110 ) surface is characterized by anisotropic in - plane lattice constants , thus induces a c@xmath9 breaking strain on monolayer fese along inplane fe - se direction .",
    "a large isotropic superconducting gap , close to that of fese on sto ( 001 ) surface , has been observed in this case .",
    "this observation goes against the common belief that high t@xmath3 can only be achieved in iron based superconductors with a tetragonal lattice .",
    "thus , the c@xmath9 breaking fese monolayer may shed new light to the mechanism of iron based superconductors . in order to understand the underlying physics",
    ", we need to figure out the similarities and differences between fese on sto ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces and the effects of the c@xmath9 breaking strain .",
    "furthermore , the iron - chalcogenides can also be matters with nontrivial topology .",
    "nontrivial topology was first theoretically predicted to exist in 1uc fese thin films on srtio@xmath0 substrates and later was discovered in fe(te , se ) systems@xcite .",
    "a robust zero - energy bound state , which is most likely be a majorana bound state , has been observed at the interstitial iron impurity in superconducting fe(te , se)@xcite , which supports nontrivial topology in fe(te , se ) materials .",
    "the c@xmath9 breaking fese monolayer can be an intriguing material to study this nontrivial topology .    in this paper , we investigate the electronic and magnetic structures of monolayer fese on sto ( 110 ) surface by performing density functional(dft ) calculations .",
    "first , we obtain the electronic structure of sto ( 110 ) surface with @xmath10 reconstruction and find that it is insulating with a large gap , consistent with previous calculations .",
    "then , for the isolated monolayer fese with compressive strain along @xmath11 direction , we find that the iron lattice becomes a staggered bipartite lattice with a height difference around 0.06   between two fe sublattices after relaxation but the glide - plane symmetry is still preserved . the electron pockets and two hole pockets are found to show elongation along @xmath11 direction , the direction of the strain , but the big hole pocket along @xmath12 direction , the orthogonal direction .",
    "the monolayer fese exhibits weak hybridization with the substrate in fese on sto ( 110 ) surface and all fe states are just located in the gap of the sto ( 110 ) surface layers",
    ". a low concentration of oxygen vacancies in sto ( 110 ) surface in the top layers can induce only very small electron doping to the fese layers . in the strained lattice ,",
    "the collinear antiferromagnetic state is still the magnetic ground state in the dft calculation but weakens compared with the lattice without strain .",
    "the strain - induced band splitting at @xmath2 can result in a band inversion and drives the system into a topologically nontrivial phase .",
    "these results , combined with the experimental observation of large superconducting gaps in these materials , support that the superconducting pairing in the fese single layer takes place dominantly within each sublattice , which has been proposed recently to unify the understanding of the robust @xmath13-wave pairing symmetry in iron - based superconductors@xcite .",

    "the structures of @xmath25 reconstructions have been solved with the combination of experimental and theoretical methods@xcite .",
    "the surface is composed of six or @xmath28 corner sharing tio@xmath9 tetrahedra , which quenches the overall dipole moment .",

    "every tetrahedron corner shares with three other surface tetrahedra except the one in the middle of eight - member ring , which is only corner sharing with two other tetrahedra .",
    "after relaxation , the atomic positions in the surface are very close to those in ref ..    the band structure of @xmath10 reconstruction in a symmetric model is given in fig.[stoband](a ) .",

    "we plot the density of states ( dos ) of surface and bulk layers in fig.[stoband](b ) .",
    "the gap for the bulk state is about 2.0 ev , consistent with previous results@xcite , and the gap for s1 layer is much larger , about 3.0 ev , which is much larger than those of tio@xmath8-terminated and sro - terminated sto ( 001 ) surfaces@xcite .",
    "the conduction bands are attributed to ti @xmath29 orbitals and the valence bands are attributed to o @xmath30 states for the bulk and s2 layers .      it is experimentally suggested that three unit cells of fese grow on the top of two unit cells of sto along @xmath1 $ ] direction but an one - to - one correspondence between fese and sto exists along the [ 001 ] direction@xcite . as a result ,",
    "a compressive strain is introduced along one axis ( @xmath1 $ ] in sto ) corresponding inplane projection of the fe - se bonding .",
    "the difference between @xmath31 and @xmath32 of monolayer fese is about 4%-5% in experiment . to simulate the effect of @xmath33 breaking strain ,",
    "we perform calculations with experimental lattice parameters @xmath34   and @xmath35 , corresponding to the compressive strain along @xmath11 direction . after full relaxation",
    ", we surprisingly find that the two fe atoms are not in the same @xmath36plane but with a height difference of 0.06 .",

    "the point group is @xmath37 at fe site and @xmath38 at se site .",

    "the glide - plane symmetry and inversion symmetry are still preserved in the strained lattice .",
    "the band structure of monolayer fese with the anisotropic strain is shown in fig.[band](a ) . because of @xmath33",
    "breaking , the degeneracy of the @xmath40 bands at @xmath2 point is removed .",
    "the dirac cone in @xmath41 line near the fermi level is also gapped due to the breaking down of @xmath42 rotational symmetry around the axis of the nearest fe - fe bond .",

    "nevertheless , there are some differences in detail between them : electron pockets and two hole pockets elongate along @xmath11 axis but the other hole pocket elongates along @xmath12 axis .",
    "the direction of elongation for electron pockets is consistent with experiment@xcite . due to the different distributions of orbitals on hole and electron pockets , these behaviours",
    "are certainly related to orbitals . with applying compression along @xmath11 axis , the onsite energy of @xmath43 orbital and hopping along @xmath11 axis increase compared with those of @xmath44 orbital .",
    "thus , the @xmath43-bands shift up in energy .",
    "the orbital distribution on hole pockets can be obtained from the fat band and is shown in fig.[band](b ) .",
    "the orbital characters of the big @xmath45 hole pocket in @xmath46 direction and @xmath47 direction are @xmath43 and @xmath44 and those of the small hole pocket reverse . with @xmath43 bands shifting up ,",
    "the big hole pocket consequently elongates along @xmath12 axis while the small one elongates along @xmath11 axis . because of the enlargement of bz along @xmath11 axis , the hole pocket attributed to @xmath48 elongates along this direction . for the electron pockets ,",
    "they also elongate along @xmath11 direction as this strain has little effect on the bands on the brillouin boundary , which are protected by symmetry .",
    "to investigate magnetic properties for strained fese monolayer , we consider four magnetic states : paramagnetic ( pm ) state , ferromagnetic state , checkerboard antiferromagnetic ( cbafm ) state and collinear afm ( cafm ) state . according to our calculations ,",
    "the cafm state is the ground state with an energy gain of 156 mev / fe relative to pm state and a spin moment of 2.16 @xmath49 for each fe .",
    "compared with fese without strain , we find that the energy gains of cbafm and cafm states relative to pm state decrease in strained fese , which indicates that the @xmath33 breaking strain suppresses both afm states . furthermore , the energy difference between cbafm and cafm states decreases , which suggests that this strain induces stronger competition and magnetic frustrations between these states .",

    "tio@xmath9 plane is about 3.1   after relaxation . similar to the isolated monolayer fese , there is a height difference of 0.1    between the two fe sublattices , which is larger than that of isolated fese due to a larger anisotropic strain .",
    "the electronic structures for both cases are rather similar and the band structure and dos for latter case are shown in fig.[bandstofese ] and fig.[dosstofese ] , respectively .",
    "as the van der waals interaction between fese and substrate is relatively weak , the band structure is just the superposition of bands for two isolated systems . the fermi level of whole system is pinned on the bottom of the conduction band of sto ( 110 ) surface .",
    "it is in sharp contrast to that of fese on sto ( 001 ) surface , where the fermi level is near the top of the valence band@xcite .",
    "the band alignments for fese on sto ( 001 ) and sto ( 110 ) surfaces are given in fig.[bandstofesevac](b ) . from fig.[dosstofese](a ) , we find that the most of @xmath29 states of fe atoms locate in the gap of the substrate . near the fermi level , the states mainly attributed to fe @xmath29 orbitals of bulk and s2 atoms of the substrate , suggesting the weak coupling between fese and the s1 layer .",
    "the @xmath44 , @xmath43 and @xmath48 bands at @xmath2 point locate at 0.105 , 0.415 and -0.096 ev relative to the fermi level .",

    "there are fermi surfaces around four special @xmath14-points due to the band - folding effect from the large unit cell .",
    "the hole pockets at @xmath2 and electron pockets at m are very similar to those of isolated fese monolayer . near the fermi level , @xmath44 , @xmath43 and @xmath48",
    "orbtials contribute dominantly , as shown in fig.[dosstofese](b ) , similar to the bulk fese .",
    "next we consider the magnetic ground state of monolayer fese on sto ( 110 ) surface . considering limitation of the computational resources ,",
    "we only perform calculations for the system without the substrate with the four considered magnetic states in isolated fese . the ground state is still found to be the collinear magnetic state with an energy gain of 66 mev / fe and a magnetic moment of 1.77 @xmath49 on each fe atom .",
    "finally , we discuss electron - doping mechanism .",
    "for fese on sto ( 001 ) surface , fese is heavily electron - doped , which has been argued due to oxygen vacancies .",
    "however , we find that the doping effects from oxygen vacancies on sto ( 110 ) surface are different from those on sto ( 100 ) surface . without a strong binding between the fese layer and the substrate , the oxygen vacancies donate little electron carriers to the fese layer",
    "therefore , the observed heavy doping concentration may suggest that there is a strong coupling between the fese layer and the substrate @xcite . in the meanwhile , this understanding also explains why the doping concentration observed in the fese on sto ( 110 ) surface is relatively lower than those observed in the fese on sto ( 001 ) surface@xcite .    to simulate the effect of oxygen vacancies ,",
    "we carry out calculations for the system with an oxygen vacancy in the @xmath62 unitcell for the @xmath10 reconstruction .",
    "we consider one and two oxygen vacancies out of fourteen oxygen atoms in the top surface layer , corresponding to 7% and 14% vacancy concentration , respectively .",
    "our calculations show that without relaxation the vacancy - induced states are below the fermi level and fully occupied , in contract to the case of sto ( 001 ) surface , where the vacancy - induced states are above the fermi level .",
    "fig.[bandstofesevac](a ) shows the band structure for the system with a vacancy in the top layer .",
    "the flat band marked by an black arrow in fig.[bandstofesevac](a ) represents the vacancy - induced states . according to the band alignments shown in fig.[bandstofesevac](b ) , we find that the vacancy - induced states in fese / sto(001 ) surface can easily be empty by donating electrons to fese layers",
    ". however , vacancy - induced state in fese / sto(110 ) surface is filled therefore the effective doping in fese layer is very small . in the above calculation ,",
    "the coupling between the fese and the substrate is small . if the coupling is large as argued in ref .",
    ", a strong binding between the fese and oxygen vacancies can change the above simple picture of energy levels to allow electron doping from oxygen vacancies . however , because of the stability caused by the formation of tio@xmath9 tetrahedra on the sto ( 110 ) surface from the reconstruction , compared to the case of sto(001 ) surface , the density of oxygen vacancies is expected to be lower @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observed electron doping being lower in monolayer fese on sto ( 110 ) surface than on sto ( 001 ) surface@xcite .",
    "  and 5% compression along @xmath32 direction .",
    "( b ) energy and momentum dependence of the ldos for the monolayer fete with strain on the [ 010 ] edge .",

    "[ edgea38 ] , height=4 ]    in fese systems , the @xmath48 band ( in two fe lattice ) with odd parity at @xmath2 point is close to @xmath45 band with even parity@xcite . with compressive strain along @xmath11 axis , the @xmath43 band can shift up and anti - cross with @xmath48 band , resulting in a band inversion at @xmath2 point . with experimental lattice parameters and strain , @xmath48 band and @xmath43 band",
    "are very close to each other .",
    "the band inversion can happen in the lattice with smaller constants or larger se height .",
    "we plot the band structure of strained fese with @xmath63   and @xmath64 in fig.[edgea38 ] , where band inversion has taken place . with spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the system is topologically nontrivial .",
    "the nontrivial edge states are shown in fig.[edgea38](b ) . as the anion height increases linearly with the concentration @xmath12 in fete@xmath5se@xmath6",
    ", we expect that this nontrivial topology can be easily realized in fe(te , se ) on sto ( 110 ) surface .",
    "although the dirac cone is far above the fermi level in the calculations , the @xmath45 bands sink below the fermi level in experiment thus these nontrivial edge states may be near the fermi level in real materials , which could be used to realize majorana modes below t@xmath3 .    from the results presented above , we find that the c@xmath9 breaking strain has great influence on the hole pockets at @xmath2 point but little on the electron pockets except an elongation in the direction of the strain .",
    "it may explain that the superconducting gap is close to that of fese on sto ( 001 ) surface because there are only electron pockets in both cases . due to the @xmath33 symmetry breaking , @xmath13-wave and @xmath65-wave",
    "pairing states can be mixed to result in an anisotropic gap . however , the observed gap in experiment is rather isotropic .",
    "it indicates that the @xmath65-wave component of the pairing state is very small and strongly unfavored , which is consistent with the pairing selection rule@xcite .    in iron based superconductors , different superconducting mechanisms based on magnetic or",
    "orbital fluctuations have been proposed@xcite . with the strain on fese ,",
    "both cafm and cbafm magnetic orders weaken but the energy difference between them decrease , suggesting stronger magnetic frustration .",
    "this frustration suppresses long - range magnetic orders to promote superconductivity , thus the superconducting gap for fese on sto ( 110 ) surface is close to that for fese on sto ( 001 ) surface . the electron phonon is considered to give an enhancement of superconductivity for fese on sto ( 001 ) surface@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the phonon frequency should strongly depend on the surfaces of the substrate .",
    "the sto ( 110 ) surface after complicated reconstructions is very different from the sto ( 001 ) surface , resulting different active phonon frequencies .",
    "however , the superconducting gaps in both cases are close , which may indicate that the electron - phonon coupling is not the primary interaction boosting superconductivity . as this anisotropic strain can suppress the long - range magnetic orders which compete with superconductivity@xcite , we expect that t@xmath3 in fese on sto ( 110 ) surface may be further increased with higher electron doping which can be achieved , for example , through potassium deposition .    in summary , we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of monolayer fese on sto ( 110 ) surface . with compressive strain along @xmath1 $ ] direction from the substrate , the monolayer fese has a staggered fe lattice composed of two inequivalent fe sublattices with a large height difference along the out - plane direction .",
    "the electron pockets and two hole pockets elongate along the direction of the strain but the remaining hole pocket elongates along the orthogonal direction .",
    "the direction of elongation for electron pockets is consistent with experimental observations .",
    "the anisotropic strain can weaken the long - range antiferromagnetic orders to enhance magnetic frustration .",
    "a low concentration of oxygen vacancies in sto ( 110 ) surface in the top layers can induce only very small electron doping to the fese layer .",
    "furthermore , the strain can induce a band inversion at @xmath2 point and drives monolayer fese into a topologically nontrivial phase .",
    "the absence of strong superconducting suppression on the staggered fe lattice suggests that the pairing configuration in real space is primarily formed within each sublattice .",

    "<S> we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of fese monolayer on the anisotropic srtio@xmath0 ( 110 ) surface . with compressive strain along @xmath1 $ ] direction from the substrate , the monolayer fese possesses a staggered bipartite iron lattice with an height difference around 0.06   along the out - plane direction . </S>",
    "<S> the staggering causes stronger magnetic frustration between the collinear and checkerboard antiferromagnetic orders , and the strain elongates one electron and two hole pockets along the strain direction and the remaining hole pocket along the orthogonal direction . </S>",
    "<S> the strain - induced band splitting at @xmath2 can also result in a band inversion to drive the system into a topologically nontrivial phase . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of strong superconducting suppression on the staggered lattice suggests that the superconducting pairings may be insensitive to the modification of interactions and hopping parameters between two fe sublattices . </S>"
