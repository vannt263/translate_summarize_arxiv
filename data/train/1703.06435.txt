    "elsv - type formulae relate connected hurwitz numbers to the intersection theory of certain classes on the moduli spaces of curves . both hurwitz theory and the theory of moduli spaces of curves benefit from them , since elsv formulae provide a bridge through which calculations and results can be transferred from one to the other .",
    "the original elsv formula @xcite relates simple connected hurwitz numbers and hodge integrals .",
    "it plays a central role in many of the alternative proofs of witten s conjecture that appeared after the first proof by kontsevich ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the simple connected hurwitz numbers @xmath0 enumerate connected hurwitz coverings of the @xmath1-sphere of degree @xmath2 and genus @xmath3 , where the partition @xmath4 determines the ramification profile over zero , and all other ramifications are simple , i.e. specified by a transposition of two sheets of the covering @xmath5 . by the riemann hurwitz formula , the number of these simple ramifications is @xmath6 ( for an introduction on hurwitz theory see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "+ the celebrated elsv formula @xcite expresses these numbers in terms of the intersection theory of moduli spaces of curves : @xmath7 a different hurwitz problem arises from harish - chandra - itzykson - zuber matrix model and leads to the study of the simple monotone connected hurwitz numbers @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) , in which an extra _ monotone _ condition is imposed on the coverings if @xmath9 are written such that @xmath10 , the condition requires that @xmath11 for all @xmath12 . for these hurwitz numbers an elsv - type formula is also known @xcite : @xmath13 where the generating series for the coefficients @xmath14 of the kappa classes reads @xmath15 more examples exist in the literature , and two of them will be subject of this paper : the elsv formula due to johnson , pandharipande and tseng ( jpt ) @xcite and a conjectural formula due to zvonkine @xcite , see also @xcite ( for the precise formulae see the table at the end of this paper ) . +      all four examples above express numbers enumerating connected hurwitz covers of a certain kind , depending on a genus parameter and a partition , in terms of some _ non - polynomial _ factor in the entries of a partition @xmath4 ( in the formulae above @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and an integral over moduli spaces of curves of a certain class intersected with @xmath18 class .",
    "this integral is clearly a _ polynomial _ of degree @xmath19 in the @xmath20 .",
    "conceptually : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a polynomial of degree @xmath23 in @xmath24 .",
    "the chekhov , eynard and orantin ( ceo ) topological recursion procedure associates to a spectral curve @xmath25 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) a collection of symmetric correlation differentials @xmath26 defined on the product of the curve @xmath27 through a universal recursion on @xmath28 .",
    "the expansion of these differentials near particular points can unveil interesting invariants , or solutions to enumerative geometric problems .",
    "+        we say that certain numbers satisfy the topological recursion if there exists a spectral curve such that the expansion of the correlation differentials near _ some _ point has those numbers as coefficients .",
    "the expansion of the correlation differentials takes the form @xmath29 for some coefficients @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a function of @xmath32 that depend on the point of the expansion .",
    "both the simple hurwitz and the monotone hurwitz numbers satisfy the topological recursion ( see @xcite ) , and their spectral curves are respectively @xmath33 in the simple hurwitz case @xmath34 , whereas in the monotone case @xmath35 . on the other side ,",
    "it was proved that the expansion of the correlation differentials _ have the same structure as the right - hand side of elsv - type formulae _ described above ( see theorem [ thm : cohft ] ) , depending on same ingredients that are functions of the spectral curve .",
    "+ at this point comes the key observation : if one can compute these ingredients explicitly for a given spectral curve @xmath36 , one proves that @xmath37 where the non - polynomial part @xmath38 , the class @xmath39 , and the @xmath40 are explicit .",
    "this allows to formulate equivalence statements in the following sense .",
    "[ def : eqst ] an _ tr - elsv equivalence statement _ for a hurwitz problem @xmath41 and a spectral curve @xmath36 asserts the equivalence between the following two propositions :    1 .   the numbers @xmath41 satisfy the topological recursion with input spectral  curve @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath42 ) + 2 .",
    "@xmath43    clearly , it makes sense to formulate an equivalence statement for certain hurwitz numbers @xmath44 and a certain spectral curve @xmath36 if for at least one of the two propositions there exists some evidence or a proof .",
    "+ thus , if one establishes @xmath45 independently of @xmath46 , then @xmath46 follows immediately ( and vice versa ) , and hence this equivalence relationship has received much attention in the literature .",
    "for example , for the case of simple hurwitz numbers and the first curve in equation , proposition @xmath45 was conjectured to hold by bouchard and mario @xcite , while @xmath46 is the original elsv formula .",

    "the equivalence statement immediately provides a new proof of @xmath45 from @xmath46 .",
    "the proofs @xcite of @xmath45 though , make use of a polynomiality property that is extracted from elsv , hence the equivalence can not be used in the other direction without falling into a circular argument , unless this polynomiality property can be proved without using elsv formula .",
    "this was done in @xcite , see also @xcite , and thus @xmath46 follows from @xmath45 by the equivalence statement .",
    "+ in the case of r - spin hurwitz numbers , proposition @xmath45 is known as @xmath47-bouchard - mario conjecture @xcite , proposition @xmath46 is the @xmath47-elsv formula conjectured by zvonkine @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 was established in @xcite , but since neither of the two have been proven , both remain conjectural .",
    "the class @xmath48 describes a semi - simple cohomological field theory ( cohft ) , possibly with non - flat unit .",
    "semi - simple cohfts with unit are classified by givental - teleman @xcite by the action of a givental @xmath49-matrix on a topological field theory . on the other hand , givental theory has been identified with the ceo topological recursion in @xcite .",
    "this identification makes givental theory a powerful and explicit tool to compute the ingredients above , and hence to prove equivalence statements .",
    "the main result in @xcite is the computation of the ingredients @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the specific spectral curve @xmath52 the class @xmath53 turns out to coincide with chiodo classes @xcite .",
    "its specialisation for @xmath54 is used in the elsv - type formulae for simple hurwitz numbers , the case @xmath55 involves the @xmath47-spin hurwitz numbers , while the case @xmath56 is used in the elsv formula for @xmath47-orbifold hurwitz numbers , derived by johnson , pandharipande and tseng ( jpt ) @xcite .",
    "the equivalence statement for general @xmath47 and @xmath57 is derived , and it specialises to the equivalence statements already known for simple and @xmath47-spin hurwitz numbers .",
    "for @xmath47-orbifold hurwitz instead , the statement is new ( see corollary [ cor : eqorbifold2 ] ) : this gives a new proof of the topological recursion for @xmath47-orbifold hurwitz numbers from jpt . on the other hand ,",
    "the topological recursion was already proved in @xcite , but extracting some polynomiality property from jpt formula itself .",
    "this polynomiality property was then proved in @xcite , see also @xcite , providing together with the equivalence statement a new proof of jpt formula .",
    "+      in this note we give a short exposition of the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the technical proofs are omitted and we refer to the original paper for them ; conversely , some of the details that are omitted in the paper are here worked out . + in section [ sec : chiodo ] we recall the definition of chiodo classes , we express them in terms of stable graphs and prove that they are given by the action of a particular givental @xmath49-matrix .",
    "+ in section [ sec : curvetogivental ] we review the key steps of doss identification and we show the result of the computation for the spectral curve @xmath58 .",
