    "among different types of magnetic interaction detected in materials , ruderman - kittle - kasuya - yosida ( rkky)@xcite mechanism , an indirect exchange interaction between two magnetic adatoms via host itinerant electrons , is one of the main reasons of coupling between magnetic impurities .",
    "this interaction is proportional to the spin susceptibility of the host material and so gives the spin information of the system.@xcite depending on the spin structure of the host material , different types of couplings can occur between magnetic adatoms via the rkky interaction . while in spin - degenerate systems , such as graphene,@xcite two localized magnetic impurities couple to each other in the form of isotropic collinear heisenberg - like term , the anisotropic collinear ising - like term with different coefficients in different spin - directions can be appeared in spin - polarized systems.@xcite moreover in materials with rashba spin - orbit coupling @xcite as well as materials with spin - valley coupling , @xcite it has been shown that twisting rkky interaction is possible by the anti - symmetric non - collinear dzyaloshinskii - moria - like term.@xcite in general , the rkky is a long - ranged interaction , ( it decays with @xmath0 , @xmath1 the dimension of the system ) which oscillates with respect to the distance between impurities and electron s fermi wave - vector .",
    "fascinating feature of this well - known mechanism is measurable in experimental observations by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) in the study of magneto - transport and single - atomic magnetometry.@xcite    moreover , the rkky interaction can be in charge of diverse magnetic phases and ordering in metals and semiconductors@xcite such as ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic @xcite as well as spin glass@xcite and spiral phases.@xcite recently , quantum anomalous hall effect ( qahe ) have been predicted theoretically@xcite and experimentally realized@xcite in magnetically doped three - dimensional ( @xmath2d ) topological insulators . since such experiments need the ferromagnetic coupling of magnetic adatoms , it brings intensive attentions to the mechanism of the coupling among magnetic impurities in this class of materials .",
    "although the rkky interaction ( and more precisely its zero chemical potential version known as van - vleck mechanism ) is thought to be the main mechanism of this coupling,@xcite such theory is still under debate.@xcite    @xmath2d topological insulators ( ti ) , systems with gapped bulk states and gapless surface states protected by time reversal symmetry ( trs ) , are a novel kind of materials that have been subject of several researches during past few years.@xcite an important branch of these topological insulators is bismuth - based structures , for instance bi@xmath3se@xmath4 and bi@xmath3te@xmath4 , which made of van - der - waals interacting layers known as quintuple layers ( ql).@xcite for thicknesses above @xmath5qls , the bismuth - based materials become topological insulator with gapless surface states@xcite which have isotropic dirac - type band dispersion presenting with an effective chiral hamiltonian arising from pure rashba - type spin - orbit coupling .",
    "combination of the pure rashba hamiltonian with being in the category of dirac materials@xcite makes tis a promising candidate for spintronic and electronic applications.@xcite since the bulk band gap of these @xmath2d systems are not enough large , in practice , the bulk states usually play a severe role in experiments and so it is more favorable to use thin version of these structures in order to reduce the effect of their bulk states .",
    "it has been experimentally shown that for @xmath6qls thickness and less , the states of different surfaces of ti thin film would be hybridized .",
    "although these ultra thin films are not @xmath2d topological insulators with gapless states , they can share other interesting features such as another topological phase transition from quantum spin hall insulator to a normal insulator,@xcite time reversal topological superconductivity@xcite and band tunability by applying perpendicular electric@xcite or in - plane magnetic field.@xcite furthermore , magnetic topological insulators and their thin version@xcite become of much importance since the ordered magnetic impurities on the surface of ti can create a magnetic field and open a gap in the band dispersion which has been observed experimentally.@xcite such intrinsic ferromagnetism can result in qahe when the fermi energy lies within the gap of the system . the rkky interaction in the rashba materials such as tis",
    "have been explored extensively.@xcite existence of the strong rashba spin - orbit coupling in these materials makes the rkky interaction to have a rich physics that includes a dm - like term @xcite and can result in different magnetic phases such as ferromagnetic , paramagnetic and spin - glass.@xcite in addition , such interaction on the surface of ti has been investigated when a superconductor presents in the proximity of ti.@xcite since the magnetic impurities ordered perpendicular to the surface of ti can produce a gap on the surface state , the rkky interaction together with such gap has been investigated self - consistently.@xcite while all these theoretical investigations have been done for a thick @xmath7 ti , the experimental realization of qahe in ti thin films makes it essential to investigate the rkky interaction in thin version of tis where two surfaces be hybridized to each other.@xcite    in this work , we have investigated the spin susceptibility of ti thin film and so the rkky interaction both at zero and finite doping .",
    "in contrast to the most of previous works on tis , we found strong spatial anisotropy of the rkky interaction with respect to the direction of the connecting line between impurities when one or both impurities have an in - plane spin - component projected on the surface of ti.@xcite we tried to explore the effect of parameters such as chemical potential , tunnelling strength between surfaces and applied biased electric field on the rkky interaction .",
    "the last one has the benefit that one can tune the rkky interaction and as a result the magnetic properties , by using an electric field .",
    "we describe our findings by means of contribution of the top and bottom surface states in the band dispersion .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follow : in section [ theory ] we introduce the theory of the work starting with the model hamiltonian . in this part",
    ", we present contribution of the top and bottom surfaces in the band dispersion separately which is so important to describe our results .",
    "next , we report our method for calculating the rkky interaction by using the real space green s function .",
    "to guarantee fluency , we have presented some details of calculations and also analytic results for the real space green s functions in the appendix [ app ] .",
    "section [ result ] presents our results where we discuss the rkky interaction between impurities on the same and different surfaces .",
    "we have summarized and concluded our results in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the surface states of the ti thin film around the @xmath8 point can be described by the two - dimensional effective hamiltonian @xcite @xmath9\\otimes\\tau_z+\\delta\\sigma_0\\otimes\\tau_x,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 are pauli matrices in spin and surface space respectively , @xmath12 represents the wave - vector of surface state s electrons and @xmath13 is their fermi velocity .",
    "the term with coefficient @xmath1 refers to the particle - hole asymmetry in the system and @xmath14 shows the potential difference between surfaces which can be caused by the effect of substrate or an external electric field applied perpendicularly to the surfaces .",
    "the last term in the above equation shows the tunneling between different surfaces and in general it is of the form @xmath15 where the @xmath16 term can result in a topological phase transition in the system with potentials lower than a critical value @xmath17 for special thin films in which @xmath18.@xcite restricting ourselves to the terms upto the first order in @xmath19 , the energy dispersion would be obtained as @xmath20 where the sign @xmath21 before the root square is related to the conduction ( c ) and valance ( v ) bands and the sign @xmath22 before parameter @xmath14 refers to the different branches @xmath23 in each of ( c , v ) bands that has been separated as a result of the applied potential @xmath14 known as rashba splitting in the band dispersion .",
    "+    a schematic figure of these band dispersions has been depicted in fig.[fig.schematic ] . in this figure",
    "the horizontal dotted line shows the chemical potential , which together with the applied potential @xmath14 are tunable parameters of the system . as a result of rashba splitting ,",
    "two different fermi wave - vectors @xmath24 appear in the system    also in this figure , the red solid lines ( the blue dashed lines ) show the criteria that the band dispersion comes mostly from the top ( bottom ) surface.@xcite this can be better understood by looking at the green s function of the system where the local density of states ( dos ) of the top surface can be studied separately from the bottom surface and its poles represent the band dispersion . by using @xmath25 , we have    @xmath26    where , @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to the top ( bottom ) surface and spin up ( down ) respectively . in addition , similarities between the components have been considered in this matrix .",
    "focusing on just the diagonal elements of the green s function which are required for calculation of the dos , we would have    @xmath29    where coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 are functions of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 as the below    @xmath35    using dos",
    "@xmath36 $ ] and the fact that the imaginary part of the green s function is peaked on the poles of eq . as @xmath37 , one can interpret the coefficients @xmath38 as the weight coefficients of the dos on different band dispersions .",
    "+    fig.[fig.coefficient ] ( a ) shows the behaviour of the weight coefficients @xmath39 as a function of @xmath19 . as shown in this figure , the weight of the conduction band @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) at large positive ( negative ) @xmath19 is dominated by the bottom ( top ) surface . at @xmath42 the dominant contribution of both conduction ( valance ) bands",
    "are originated from the top ( bottom ) surface state .",
    "it should be mentioned that surface states hybridization emerges around the band edges where group velocity of carriers is zero .",
    "the region where surface states are hybrid with each other depends only on the tunnelling between two surfaces @xmath43 and not on the applied bias @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig.coefficient ] ( b ) shows the k - derivative of the coefficient @xmath44 for different biased potentials @xmath45ev and two different gap sizes @xmath46ev ( solid symbols ) and @xmath47ev ( hollow symbols ) .",
    "these diagrams are peaked functions of @xmath19 with the widths proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "the bias voltage @xmath14 can just change the position of these peaks with no effect on their widths .",
    "in addition to the weight coefficients for the band dispersion which we will use them in the result section , one can calculate the density of states ( dos ) for the top and bottom surface separately .",
    "fig.[fig.ldos ] shows the dos of different surfaces for fixed tunnelling parameter @xmath46 ev and two different values of voltage @xmath49 ev .",
    "as one can see , van - hove singularities appear in the dos due to rashba splitting ( @xmath50 ) when the energy touches the boundaries of the gap @xmath51 .      by placing two magnetic impurities on the surfaces of ti thin film , the hamiltonian",
    "would be modified to @xmath52 where @xmath53 shows the spin moment of the localized magnetic impurity , @xmath54 denotes the spin of itinerant electrons and @xmath55 displays the coupling between them . by applying the second order perturbation theory",
    ", one can transform the interaction between magnetic impurities and itinerant electrons to an indirect exchange interaction between two magnetic impurities .",
    "thus , the rkky interaction would read as @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the spin susceptibility of the system and can be evaluated as @xmath58 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote t / b surface , @xmath61 show different directions of magnetic moment s component , @xmath62 refers to the fermi energy and trace is taken over the spin degree of freedom .    in order to calculate the spin susceptibility eq .",
    ", it is needed to calculate the unperturbed retarded green s function in real space , @xmath63 which reads from the green s function in k - space eq . by taking fourier transformation",
    "@xmath64    such green s function has a general form of    @xmath65    where the components of the green s functions are given in appendix [ app ] .",
    "the impurities can be both located on the same surface ( intra - surface ) as well as different surfaces(inter - surface ) .",
    "although in the former case the position of impurities can be assumed to be both on the top or bottom surfaces but using the symmetry of layer inversion together with @xmath66 , one can achieve the result of the bottom surface from the top one and so in the following , we discuss two configurations namely , impurities to be located on the top surface and impurities located on different surfaces .",
    "after some calculations , the rkky hamiltonian eq . can be written as    @xmath67    where the new spinors @xmath68 is defined as @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and also the vector @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the details of the above terms including some analytic results can be found in appendix [ app ] .    in conventional two - dimension materials with isotropic band dispersion , the rkky interaction does not depend on the direction of @xmath73 , the distance vector between impurities .",
    "however , in systems with rashba spin - orbit coupling , the spin of itinerant electrons is coupled to the wave - vector @xmath74 and an impurity with an in - plane magnetic moment would break the isotropy of the system , so the spin - response @xmath75 depends on both magnitude and direction of the vector @xmath73.@xcite        the rkky interaction coefficients @xmath76s , introduced in eq . for two",
    "considered configurations of impurities , intra - surface case ( @xmath77 ) or inter - surface case ( @xmath78 ) , are defined as follow @xmath79    the first term in eq .",
    "is similar to the heisenberg spin interaction which makes no difference between different spin - directions coupling .",
    "however , the second term couples the new spinors @xmath68 instead of @xmath80 and since @xmath68 depends on the angle @xmath81 , the @xmath82 couples spinors of two impurities which have different amplitudes in different directions .",
    "this interaction is similar to the ising interaction .",
    "both of these terms will result in collinear alignment of spinors @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , due to the existence of rashba spin - orbit coupling in ti thin film , symmetry of spin space is broken and so it is expected that the rkky interaction would also have terms related to the off - diagonal components of the spin - susceptibility tensor.@xcite the third and forth terms of the above hamiltonian are of this kind and contrarily with the first two terms , they can cause non - collinear twisted alignment between spinors of impurities . while the third term is anti - symmetric with respect to the spinors and resembles the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction , the last term is symmetric .     +",
    "in this section , we present our results for the rkky interaction between two magnetic impurities located on the top surface ( tt ) or on two different surfaces ( tb ) . as we have shown in the previous section ,",
    "the soc in the topological insulator results in the angle - dependent of the rkky interaction when magnetic moment of impurities have an in - plan component .",
    "we start our result section by presenting this angle dependency of the spin susceptibility in fig.[fig.chiphir ] . in this figure",
    ", we have assumed both impurities to be located on the top surface and @xmath85 ev , @xmath46 ev and also we have considered two voltages , @xmath86 ( panel ( a , b ) ) and @xmath87 ev ( panel ( c , d ) ) .",
    "we have plotted diagonal parts of the spin - susceptibility tensor in panels ( a , c ) where except @xmath88 , other terms oscillate with @xmath89 .",
    "the off - diagonal parts depicted in panels ( b , d ) oscillate with @xmath90 as expected from eq .. besides , by comparing the upper and lower panels it is specified how applying the voltage can drastically change sign and magnitude of the interaction terms .",
    "the behaviour of the rkky interaction terms are severely affected by distance between two magnetic impurities . in two - dimensional materials ,",
    "they usually fall off with @xmath91 and also oscillate as @xmath92 , however for materials with several bands , a more complicated behavior is expected . in fig.[fig.jr ] , we have plotted @xmath93 , times @xmath94 and scaled by @xmath95 , in terms of distance @xmath96 for intra- ( panel(a ) ) and inter- ( panel(b ) ) surface case .",
    "as one can see in this figure , for the long range distances , all interaction terms decay as @xmath91 as like as other two - dimensional structures.@xcite for the intra - surface pairing and in the short distance limit which plays a more prominent role at higher densities of impurities , the rkky interaction has much higher values .",
    "in contrast to the intra - surface pairing between impurities , the rkky interaction multiplied by @xmath94 behaves in a more strange way for the inter - surface pairing .",
    "first , it starts from nearly zero values at short distances and then it oscillates in a beating type pattern according to the existence of two different wave - vectors in the system.@xcite by looking at the weight coefficients in eq .",
    ", one can see that for the top surface , @xmath97 has a more prominent role rather than @xmath98 , and that s why it is seen a roughly monotonic oscillation for the rkky interaction in the intra - surface case .",
    "however in the inter - surface case , both surfaces and as a result both @xmath99s become important and beating type occurs due to two different oscillations characterized by @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "+    fig.[fig.jef ] shows the effect of the fermi energy on the rkky interaction terms for intra - surface ( a , c ) and inter - surface ( b , d ) cases . here , we chose @xmath100 nm , @xmath46 ev and also @xmath86 ev in panels ( a , b ) and @xmath101 ev in panels ( c , d ) .",
    "as shown in these figures , for the fermi energy inside the gap , @xmath102 , all types of interactions are nearly zero according to insulating nature of the material , however they are not exactly zero and have small values which refer to the van - vleck mechanism.@xcite by comparing the insets of panel ( a ) and ( c ) in fig.[fig.jef ] , it is observed that all the interaction terms change with the potential @xmath14 and none of them can be neglected in favour of another . at the regime of finite",
    "doping , the rkky interaction would take very larger values than undoped situation and oscillate , however this oscillation does nt occur with a constant period which is originated from complicated form of the band structure . as mentioned in the previous section in fig.[fig.ldos ] , the density of states would have van - hove singularities at the edge of the band gap for @xmath103 and as a result , as shown in fig.[fig.jef ] ( c , d ) , the rkky interaction would take very large values at very small doping ( at the edge of conduction band ) which is a result of rashba - splitting in the band dispersion .",
    "due to increasing of the dos with energy for the intra - surface case , the rkky interaction terms gradually increase with the fermi energy . in the presence of rashba",
    "splitting ( panel c ) , all the terms first decrease by decrease of @xmath98 and then after the critical fermi energy @xmath104 in which @xmath98 becomes zero , they increase .",
    "the change in the fermi wavevector @xmath98 is proportional to a change in the electron s density on the top surface which justifies this behavior .    for the inter - surface case ,",
    "the dominant parameter for controlling the rkky interaction between two impurities located on different surfaces is not only the dos on the top and bottom surfaces , but also the inter - surface hybridization of the surface states . in this case , as seen in fig.[fig.jef ] ( b , d ) , the rkky interaction terms decrease with respect to the energy .",
    "this can be described by the weight factors explained in sec.[hamil ] which say that at higher energies , the surface states are not hybridized any more and they will be purely localized on the top or the bottom surface which results in weakening of the inter - surface interaction .",
    "furthermore , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig.jef ] ( b ) , for @xmath105 , there is only the heisenberg interaction for the inter - surface case and other terms are exactly zero . in this case , the band dispersions belonging to different spin helical states wo nt split .",
    "this property together with the form of the tunnelling between surfaces , @xmath33 , which does not couple different spins , make the rkky interaction to be isotropic collinear .    to see the effect of rashba splitting on the rkky interaction , in fig.[fig.jv ] , the behaviour of all rkky interaction terms for intra- ( panel a ) and inter- ( panel b ) surface pairing are shown with respect to @xmath14 . fixing the chemical potential and changing the biased potential",
    ", one can tune the fermi wave - vectors together with dos and as a result tune the rkky interaction .",
    "tuning the magnetic properties of materials with electric field is so desirable for spintronic technologies.@xcite for the intra - surface pairing depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.jv ] ( a ) , the rkky interaction drops by decrease of @xmath98 and then after the critical biased voltage @xmath106 in which @xmath107 , it increases . at this critical voltage ,",
    "the density of electrons on the top surface in which mediate the rkky interaction becomes nearly zero and that s why the rkky strength has its minimum in the dashed circle .",
    "the quenching the rkky interaction terms in the critical voltage has the same root as its quench in the special fermi energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.jef ] ( c ) .",
    "this transition in the rkky interaction behaviour has been pointed out by an arrow and black dashed circle in the figure . for the inter - surface case both @xmath99s play a role and regardless of oscillations the interaction increases .",
    "+      the rkky interaction refers to indirect exchange interaction via conduction s electrons which occurs in the metallic phase of systems .",
    "however , looking at eq .",
    ", one can see the rkky interaction is originated from all energies lower than the fermi energy @xmath62 as well , so it would have non - zero value even at zero chemical doping @xmath108 .",
    "although , in this regime the indirect exchange interaction known as van - vleck interaction , is much weaker than the rkky interaction , it can affect magnetic phases of materials.@xcite the @xmath109 component of the van - vleck interaction ( related to @xmath88 ) has been studied in ti thin films @xcite to describe the ferromagnetic phase in qahe experiment . here",
    "we investigate all terms of this interaction and its tunability with the biased potential @xmath14 .",
    "+    figure [ fig.jvan ] ( a ) shows the van - vleck interaction with respect to distance r. as shown in this figure , all the interaction terms falls off very rapidly and becomes zero after @xmath110 nm .",
    "panel ( b ) shows how this interaction is also oscillating with respect to the biased electric potential @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , it is obvious from this figure that @xmath14 make the van - vleck interaction stronger .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the effect of rashba - type band splitting on the rkky interaction in topological insulator thin films .",
    "we explored the rkky interactions for two different situations of magnetic impurities separately , namely inter - surface pairing and intra - surface pairing where we reported completely different behaviors .",
    "we describe this diversity by mapping the density of states onto the band dispersion and finding the share of each surface on the band dispersion .",
    "we have shown how the rkky interaction in the rashba materials have a strong direction - dependency ( spatial anisotropy ) when at least one of the impurities has a spin component parallel to the plane .",
    "in addition to the conventional rkky interaction terms mentioned in the rashba materials , namely heisenberg - like , ising - like and dm - like , we found another term of the spin - susceptibility tensor which in contrast to the dm term is a symmetric interaction .",
    "we also investigate the rkky interaction at zero doping where the chemical potential lies within the gap of the ti thin film , ( usually known as the van - vleck mechanism ) .",
    "this can shed a light on solving the problem of qahe which has been done experimentally at zero chemical doping .",
    "furthermore , we show that how the rashba splitting makes a van - hove singularity in the band dispersion at the band edges giving rise to large values of the rkky interaction .",
    "so by a small value of the chemical doping , the rkky interaction can be extremely modified .",
