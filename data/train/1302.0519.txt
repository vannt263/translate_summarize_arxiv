    "the technological applications of thin films and multilayers motivated intense theoretical study of growth models in the last decades @xcite .",
    "many processes show evidence of a competition between different aggregation dynamics .",
    "for instance , this occurs in deposition of diamond - like carbon by plasma , where growth is mainly due to aggregation of slow radicals but ion bombardment is essential to create @xmath7 bonds @xcite . when physico - chemical conditions are continuously changed , such as in cyclical electrodeposition / dissolution of metals , competing dynamics are also present @xcite .",
    "consequently , many competitive growth models were already proposed , with microscopic aggregation rules representing the atomistic dynamics . they are usually defined on lattices , such as those with aggregation of different species of particles @xcite and those mixing different aggregation rules for the same species @xcite .",
    "they usually show crossover effects from one dynamics at small times @xmath8 and short length scales @xmath9 to another dynamics at long @xmath8 or large @xmath9 , and in special cases anomalous roughening is present @xcite .",
    "a widely studied group of models is that showing crossover from random ( uncorrelated ) deposition ( rd ) to some correlated deposition ( cd ) process , hereafter called rd - cd models",
    ". for rd - cd in general , aggregation of each incident particle follows the rules of the cd process with probability @xmath0 and those of rd with probability @xmath10 ( other models might also show the same crossover with a parameter that is not a probability @xcite ) .",
    "another group of relevant models show crossover from edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite to kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite scaling .",
    "a representative model in this latter group is the competition between ballistic deposition ( bd ) @xcite and random deposition with surface relaxation ( rdsr , or family model ) @xcite , respectively with probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath10 . in all cases",
    ", the crossover appears for small @xmath0 .    for several reasons ,",
    "the association of those models with stochastic growth equations of the langevin type is a problem of central interest .",
    "first , it facilitates finding asymptotic properties which are frequently unclear in numerical works on lattice models @xcite .",
    "secondly , renormalization study of the growth equation may relate unexpected numerical results to crossover or instability effects @xcite .",
    "finally , improvement in atomistic modeling of thin film growth may be achieved from the advance on the stochastic equation analysis .",
    "langevin equations for some of those competitive growth models were derived in refs . @xcite and scaling",
    "features of kpz and ew equations were discussed by several authors @xcite . for rd - rdsr and bd - rdsr models ,",
    "muraca et al @xcite suggested quadratic dependence of equation coefficients on the probability @xmath0 in the crossover regime , which was in good agreement with available numerical data .",

    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of ref .",
    "the results for rd - rdsr were confirmed by scaling arguments in refs .",
    "however , the claim on the universal quadratic form of vanishing coefficients @xcite is ruled out by the study of a restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) @xcite model with deposition and erosion , which shows linear @xmath0-dependence of the nonlinear term in the kpz equation @xcite , and by the rd - bd model @xcite , which shows @xmath12 scaling of that term .    in this work ,",
    "langevin - type equations associated with various competitive lattice models showing rd - cd and ew - kpz crossovers are derived through a standard van kampen expansion of the master equation , followed by a proper choice of the jump moments . from this approach",
    ", the form of the equation coefficients is remarkably different from the one proposed by muraca et al @xcite : in all cases , the random choice of the asymptotically dominant process gives a linear dependence on @xmath0 for the coefficients that vanish as @xmath3 , instead of the quadratic dependence .",
    "however , for rd - cd models , average local slopes diverge as @xmath3 , thus the optimal regularization of step functions ( present in the transition rates of all discrete models ) have lowest order coefficients that scale as @xmath0 or @xmath13 , depending on the aggregation mechanism of the cd .",
    "the combination of those scaling relations give equation coefficients of ew and kpz equations vanishing as @xmath0 , @xmath14 , or @xmath12 .",
    "in all cases , they agree with simulations and other scaling approaches @xcite .",
    "for the rdsr - bd model , we show that a non - asymptotic regime with quadratic scaling is present , which is associated with the dominant effect of subsequent bd events , while the asymptotic linear relation is predicted for @xmath0 much smaller than that of previous simulations @xcite .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , three lattice models with the rd - cd crossover are defined and the approach to predict amplitudes of roughness scaling is reviewed . in sec .",
    "iii , details of the method to derive langevin equations are presented and the equation for the rd - rdsr model is obtained . in sec .",
    "iv , the equations for the rd - bd model and for the bidisperse ballistic deposition are constructed . in sec .",
    "v , the equation for the bd - rdsr model is presented and the crossover from quadratic to linear scaling is discussed . in sec .",
    "vi we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "in these models , growth begins with a flat @xmath15-dimensional substrate with cubic symmetry and @xmath9 adsorption sites ( or columns ) in each direction , with a total of @xmath16 sites .",
    "cubic particles of lateral size @xmath17 ( parallel to the substrate plane ) and vertical size @xmath18 ( parallel to the average growth direction ) are sequentially released at randomly chosen columns above the deposit and fall vertically towards the substrate .",
    "the time interval for deposition of one layer of atoms [ @xmath16 atoms ] is @xmath19 .",
    "each incident particle may irreversibly stick at the top of the column of incidence , with probability @xmath10 ( rd ) , or move and stick following some aggregation rule that takes into account the neighboring column heights ( mimicking physical processes like diffusion , desorption , or bond formation ) , with probability @xmath0 ( cd ) .",
    "the competitive models where rdsr and bd are the correlated components were introduced by albano and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the rules of rdsr @xcite are illustrated in fig .",
    "1a : the particle sticks at the top of the column of incidence if no neighboring column has a smaller height , otherwise it sticks at the top of the column with the smallest height among the neighbors ( if two or more neighbors have the same height , one of them is randomly chosen ) . in bd , which is illustrated in fig . 1b , the incident particle aggregates at the first site where it finds a nearest neighbor occupied site ( lateral or below it ) @xcite , which generates a porous deposit .",
    "bbd was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and is itself defined as a competitive model . taking the @xmath20 case for illustration , particles of two different sizes incide towards the surface : single - site particles ( lateral size @xmath17 , vertical size @xmath18 ) with probability @xmath21 and double - site particles ( dimers with lateral size @xmath22 , vertical size @xmath18 ) with probability @xmath23 .",
    "any incident particle permanently sticks at the first position where it encounters a previously deposited particle below it .",
    "the aggregation of a dimer leads to pore formation when the neighboring columns have different heights , similarly to the lateral aggregation of bd .",
    "the rules of bbd are illustrated in fig .",
    "1c .    in these models ,",
    "the surface configuration is the array of discrete height variables @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . in all deposits ( compact or porous )",
    ", the height variable is the one of the highest particle at that substrate site , thus @xmath26 always refers to the outer surface of the deposit .",
    "the global roughness of the surface is defined as the rms fluctuation of the height variables , whose average is @xmath27 : @xmath28 here the overbars indicate spatial averages over the height variables , the sum is taken over all the @xmath16 substrate sites , and the angular brackets indicate configurational averages . at short times , rd dominates , thus the roughness increases as @xmath29 after a crossover time @xmath30 , the cd determines the universality class of the process .",
    "the roughness follows family - vicsek ( fv ) scaling @xcite as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the roughness exponent , @xmath33 is a scaling function such that @xmath34 in the regime of roughness saturation ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 is the characteristic time of crossover to saturation , which scales as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the dynamic exponent . for @xmath39",

    "fv scaling implies @xmath50    the scaling approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite explain the values of the exponents obtained in simulations of lattice models and show that only one exponent [ usually @xmath51 or @xmath52 ; eq . ( [ defdeltaygamma ] ) ] is sufficient to characterize the crossover .    for @xmath53",
    ", most deposited atoms attach to the top of the randomly chosen site ( rd ) .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ wrandom ] ) , the height difference of neighboring sites is of order @xmath54 after a time interval @xmath55 . on the other hand , the average time for a correlated event ( probability @xmath0 ) to occur at a given column is @xmath56 .    in the case of ballistic - like models ( e. g. bd or bbd ) , the frequent lateral aggregation ( e. g. at columns 2 and 8 in fig .",

    "however , in the case of solid - on - solid ( sos ) models , such as rdsr , the column height changes by a single lattice unit at each time step .",
    "a single cd event does not cancel the random height fluctuation @xmath58 of neighboring columns ; instead , it only reduces that fluctuation by one lattice unit ( e. g. the particle aggregating at column 3 in fig .",
    "the height fluctuation produced by rd will be suppressed only when the number of correlated events @xmath59 is of order @xmath60 . at the crossover time @xmath30 , this number is @xmath61 , thus @xmath62    in both cases , all time scales of the purely correlated system ( @xmath63 ) are also changed by the scaling factor @xmath64 , such as the saturation time @xmath36 [ eq .",
