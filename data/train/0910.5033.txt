    "the _ heat kernel approach _ ( hka for short ) , which will be presented and discussed in this paper , is a systematic method to construct state price densities which are analytically tractable . to be precise on analytic tractability , we mean with this notion that bond prices can be calculated explicitly , and that caps , swaptions or other derivatives on bonds can be calculated up to one integration with respect to the law of the underlying factor markov process",
    ". therefore such models can be easily calibrated to market data and are useful for pricing and hedging purposes , but also for purposes of risk management .",
    "the original motivation of introducing the hka was in modelling of interest rates with jumps .",
    "in the hjm framework @xcite , the drift condition becomes quite complicated ( see h. shirakawa s pioneering work @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein ) if taking jumps into account , while in the spot rate approach , one will find it hard to obtain explicit expressions of the bond prices ( the affine class is almost the only exception ) . in @xcite , the state price density approach .",
    "] is applied and by means of transition probability densities of some lvy processes explicit expressions of the zero coupon bond prices are obtained .",
    "the hka is actually a full extension of the method , and thanks to the generalization its applications are now not limited to jump term structure models as we will show in the sequel .    before the presentation of the theorem , we will give a brief survey of the state price density approaches such as the potential approach by l.c.g .",
    "rogers @xcite or hughston s approach @xcite @xcite , etc , in section [ spda ] and section [ lreview ] .",
    "our models are within the class of _ markov functional models _ proposed by p.  hunt , j.  kennedy and a.  pelsser @xcite , and therefore compatible with their practical implementations .",
    "one of the contributions of the hka to the literature could be to give a systematic way to produce markov functional models .    as a whole , this paper is meant to be an introduction to the hka , together with some examples .",
    "topics from practical viewpoint like fitting to the real market , tractable calibration , or econometric empirical studies , are not treated in this paper .",
    "nonetheless we note that hka is an alternative approach to practical as well as theoretical problems in interest rate modeling .",
    "we will start from a brief survey of state price densities . by a _ market _ , we mean a family of price - dividend pairs @xmath0 , @xmath1 , which are adapted processes defined on a filtered probability space @xmath2 .",
    "a strictly positive process @xmath3 is a _ state price density _ with respect to the market if for any @xmath1 , it holds that @xmath4,\\ ] ] or for any @xmath5 , @xmath6.\\ ] ] in other words , @xmath7 gives a ( random ) discount factor of a cash flow @xmath8 at time @xmath9 multiplied by a radon nikodym derivative .",
    "if we denote by @xmath10 the market value at time @xmath11 of zero - coupon bond with maturity @xmath9 , then the formula ( [ cff2 ] ) gives @xmath12.\\ ] ] from a perspective of modeling term structure of interest rates , the formula ( [ spd ] ) says that , given a filtration , each strictly positive process @xmath13 generates an _ arbitrage - free _ interest rate model .",
    "on the basis of this observation , we can construct arbitrage - free interest rate models . notice that we do not assume @xmath14 to be a submartingale ,",
    "i.e. in economic terms _ we do not assume positive short rates_.      the rational log - normal model by flesaker and hughston @xcite was a first successful interest rate model derived from the state price density approach .",
    "they put @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are deterministic decreasing process , @xmath18 is a one dimensional standard brownian motion and @xmath19 is a constant .",
    "the model is an analytically tractable , leads to positive - short rates , and is fitting any initial yield curve .",
    "furthermore closed - form solutions for both caps and swaptions are available .",
    "several extensions of this approach are known .    in @xcite ,",
    "rogers introduced a more systematic method to construct positive - rate models which he called the _",
    "potential approach_. actually he introduced two approaches ; in the first one , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the resolvent operator of a markov process on a state space @xmath22 , @xmath23 is a positive function on @xmath22 , and @xmath24 is a positive constant . in the second one",
    ", @xmath23 is specified as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the generator of @xmath25 .",
    "note that when @xmath25 is a brownian motion , @xmath26 for any @xmath27 is an eigenfunction of its generator , and the model gives another perspective to the rational lognormal models above .    in @xcite l.",
    "hughston and a.  rafailidis proposed yet another framework for interest rate modelling based on the state price density approach , which they call a _",
    "chaotic approach to interest rate modelling_. the wiener chaos expansion technique is then used to formulate a systematic analysis of the structure and classification of interest rate models .",
    "actually , m.r .",
    "grasselli and t.r .",
    "hurd @xcite revisit the cox - ingersoll - ross model of interest rates in the view of the chaotic representation and they obtain a simple expression for the fundamental random variable @xmath28 as @xmath29)^2 | \\mathcal{f}_t ] $ ] holds . in line with these , a stable property of the second - order chaos is shown in @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the simple concepts of the heat kernel approach ( hka ) and several classes of possibly interesting examples .",
    "the guiding philosophy of hka is the following : if one can easily calculate expectations of the form @xmath30 for some factor markov process @xmath31 , and if one knows _",
    "explicitly _ one additional function @xmath32 depending on time and the state variables , then one can construct explicit formulas for bond prices , and analytically tractable formulas for caps , swaptions , etc ( i.e. , those formulas are evaluated by one numerical integration with respect to the law of the underlying markov process ) . in other words ,",
    "any explicit solution of a well - understood kolmogorov equation with respect to some markov process leads to a new class of interest rate models .",
    "we consider a general markov process @xmath33 on a polish state space @xmath22 and a probability space @xmath34 with filtration @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 defined on @xmath37 be a strictly positive function .",
    "it is said to satisfy the * propagation property with respect to @xmath31 * if @xmath38 for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we assume furthermore that @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 satisfy the propagation property with respect to the markov process @xmath31 and @xmath44 .",
    "we define then a state price density @xmath14 through @xmath45 we clearly have the following basic assertion :    [ hkabond ] bond prices are given through @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath40 .",
    "the bond prices are calculated with respect to the state price density ( [ spdofhka ] ) through @xmath48 actually , by the markov property and by the propagation property we can calculate the right hand side , @xmath49 for all @xmath40 and @xmath47 .",
    "notice that this remarkable simple formula is given with respect to the * historical*/*physical * measure .",
    "a derivative with payoff @xmath50 on @xmath51 for some @xmath47 has at time @xmath52 the price @xmath53,\\ ] ] which is analytically tractable if one knows how to calculate expectations of the form @xmath54 .",

    ", then @xmath58 satisfies the propagation property ( [ propro ] ) .",
    "this example demonstrates that the previous theory covers the results of @xcite .",
    "indeed , consider a @xmath59-dimensional lvy process @xmath60 starting at @xmath61 in its natural filtration .",
    "we assume that it has a density @xmath62 with respect to lebesgue measure",
    ". then @xmath63 defines a markov process on @xmath64 and we have that @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "notice that this example can be associated to the previous example [ genericexample ] if one allows @xmath68 in the sense of distributions .",
    "consider an affine markov process @xmath25 on @xmath69 and @xmath70 such that @xmath71 exist .",
    "then we define @xmath72 for some numbers @xmath73 . in the spirit of the previous generic example we obtain @xmath74 for @xmath75 and each initial value @xmath76 .",
    "notice that the `` laplace transforms '' @xmath77 are easily calculated for affine processes , which yields a concrete representation of the prices in the physical measure .",
    "these models are completely new interest models constructed from affine models . for instance , the derived short rate models have interesting ( econometric ) features .",
    "an example driven by the affine cox - ingersoll - ross process is visualized in figure 1 .",
    "the pay - off ( at its maturity @xmath78 ) of a ( unit of ) swaption is @xmath79 where @xmath80 with @xmath81 is the tenor structure of the swap contract , and @xmath82 is the swap rate ( see e.g. @xcite*chapter 1 , section 6 ) . note that ( [ pay - off1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath83 therefore in the state price density approach , the quantity @xmath84 we get @xmath85 by hka , namely @xmath86 where @xmath32 has the propagation property w.r.t . a markov process @xmath25 .",

    "then the short rate @xmath89 of the previous interest rate model is given through @xmath90 since @xmath91 the sign of the short rate is determined through @xmath92 notice that we do not necessarily have a short rate process .",
    "take a finite dimensional manifold @xmath93 and take @xmath25 a markov process with values in @xmath93 .",
    "a non - vanishing function @xmath94 with @xmath95 for some @xmath96 is called eigenfunction of @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath97 , @xmath98 be eigenfuntions with eigenvalues @xmath99 , and let @xmath100 be decreasing functions .",

[ swpformula ] the pricing formula of the swaption is @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110    let @xmath31 be a brownian motion with drift : whose generator is @xmath111 where @xmath112 . for @xmath113 with @xmath114 , we have @xmath115 therefore , if @xmath116 is such that @xmath117 ( this is always possible , take @xmath118 for example ) , then the state price density @xmath119 where @xmath120 , gives a positive rate model . in this case @xmath121 where @xmath122 notice that the black - scholes formula for the price at time @xmath11 of the call option with the strike @xmath123 and the maturity @xmath9 is given by @xmath124",
    "this example corresponds to the flesaker - hughston s rational log - normal model @xcite .",
    "let @xmath31 be an ornstein - uhlenbeck process on @xmath125 , whose generator @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "setting @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 therefore we have that @xmath131 is an eigenfunction with the eigenvalue @xmath132 . setting @xmath133 and @xmath134 , we obtain @xmath135 where @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the proof see the appendix [ ap : ou ] .",
    "as we have pointed out the propagation property of @xmath32 does not ensure that the process @xmath139 is a supermartingale .",
    "thus , the interest rate model with @xmath140 does not exclude the possibility of negative rates . in this section",
    "we provide models based on hka and leading to positive short rates .",
    "let @xmath32 be a positive function with propagation property with respect to a markov process @xmath25 , and a weight @xmath141 such that @xmath142 for arbitrary @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",

    "for @xmath147 and @xmath40 , we have @xmath148 here we have used the propagation property of @xmath32 . since @xmath149 we have the desired result .",
    "thus interest rate models with @xmath150 have positive short rates .",
    "the class is an extension of the potential models defined in @xcite , since we can take @xmath32 as in and @xmath151 .",
    "let @xmath152 be a non - negative , measurable function defined on @xmath22 . put @xmath153 and @xmath154 then the bond market spanned by @xmath155 is arbitrage - free with respect to the state price density @xmath156 indeed , this corresponds to an additional factor @xmath157 for @xmath158 added to the markov process @xmath31 . since @xmath159 is again a markov process on @xmath160 , we notice that @xmath161 defined on @xmath162 satisfies the propagation property",
