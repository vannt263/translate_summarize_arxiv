    "these various scenarios all lead to similar predictions for the power spectrum . on the other hand , nongaussian statistics ( such as the bispectrum ) provide a powerful tool to observationally discriminate between different mechanisms for generating the curvature perturbation . in this review , which is based on @xcite , we will present a _",

    "mechanism for generating cosmological perturbations during inflation .",
    "we discuss in detail the predictions of this new scenario for both the spectrum and nongaussianity of the primordial curvature fluctuations , showing how this new mechanism may be observationally distinguished from previous approaches .",
    "the possibility to discriminate between various inflationary scenarios has lead to a recent surge of interest in computing and measuring nongaussian statistics .",
    "although single field , slow roll models are known to produce negligible nongaussianity @xcite , there are now a variety of scenarios available in the literature which may predict an observable signature .",
    "departures from gaussianity are often parametrized in the following form @xmath5\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the primordial curvature perturbation , @xmath7 is a gaussian random field and @xmath8 characterizes the degree of nongaussianity .",
    "the ansatz ( [ local_f_nl ] ) is known as the `` local '' form of nongaussianity .",
    "although the local ansatz ( [ local_f_nl ] ) has received significant attention , it is certainly not the only well - motivated model for a nongaussian curvature perturbation .",
    "for example , the nongaussian part of @xmath6 need not be correlated with the gaussian part .",
    "consider a primordial curvature perturbation of the form @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is some nonlinear ( not necessarily quadratic ) function and @xmath11 is a gaussian field which is uncorrelated with @xmath7 .",
    "both ( [ local_f_nl ] ) and ( [ uncorr ] ) are local in position space , however , these two types of nongaussianity will have very different observational implications . the uncorrelated ansatz ( [ uncorr ] ) for the primordial curvature perturbation can arise , for example , in models with preheating into light fields @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for more discussion of nongaussianity from preheating and @xcite for another model where nongaussianity is generated at the end of inflation . )",
    "a useful quantity to consider is the _ bispectrum _ , @xmath12 , which is the 3-point correlation function of the fourier transform of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the delta function appearing in ( [ bispectrum_def ] ) reflects translational invariance and ensures that @xmath15 depends on three momenta @xmath16 which form a triangle : @xmath17 .",
    "rotational invariance implies that @xmath15 is symmetric in its arguments .",
    "if we assume the ansatz ( [ local_f_nl ] ) for the primordial curvature perturbation then @xmath15 has a very particular dependence on momenta ; it peaks in the squeezed limit where one of the wave - numbers is much smaller than the remaining two ( e.g.  - @xmath18 ) .",
    "such a bispectrum is referred to as having a _ squeezed _ shape . however , other shapes of bispectrum are worth considering .",
    "a bispectrum is referred to as `` equilateral '' if it peaks when @xmath19 and `` flattened '' if it peaks when one of the wave - numbers is half the size of the remaining two ( e.g.  - @xmath20 ) .    without assuming any specific form for the primordial curvature perturbation , such as ( [ local_f_nl ] ) or ( [ uncorr ] )",
    ", one may characterize an arbitrary bispectrum ( [ bispectrum_def ] ) by specifying its shape , running and size @xcite . as discussed above",
    ", the shape refers to the configuration of triangle on which @xmath15 is maximal ( squeeze , equilateral or flattened ) .",
    "the running of the bispectrum refers to how the magnitude of @xmath15 depends on the overall size of the triangle .",
    "for example , in the case of scale invariant fluctuations , the bispectrum must scale as @xmath21 .",
    "finally , the overall size of the bispectrum is often quantified by evaluating the magnitude of @xmath15 on some fixed equilateral triangle . however , the skewness of the probability density function ( defined later ) might provide a better measure of the size of nongaussianity .",
    "different types of nongaussian signatures are correlated with properties of the underlying inflation model .",
    "let us first consider some examples with small running :    1 .",
    "a large bispectrum of local shape , along with iso - curvature effects , is associated with models where multiple fields are light ( or otherwise dynamically important ) during inflation .",
    "examples include the curvaton mechanism @xcite or models with turning points along the inflationary trajectory @xcite .",
    "the observational bound on local type nongaussianity , coming from the wmap7 @xcite data , is @xmath22 @xcite at 95% confidence level .",
    "when combined with large scale structure ( lss ) data the bound becomes somewhat stronger : @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "2 .   a large local bispectrum _ without _ any iso - curvature fluctuations can _ only _ be produced by nonlocal inflation models @xcite . for any single - field inflation model described by a local low - energy",
    "effective field theory , the results of @xcite imply that the ratio of the 3-point correlation function to the square of the 2-point function must be of order the spectral tilt , in the squeezed limit .",
    "hence , it has been argued that a large squeezed bispectrum must be associated with the presence of multiple light degrees of freedom , and hence iso - curvature effects .",
    "however , in @xcite it was shown single field nonlocal inflation models can produce a large squeezed bispectrum in the regime where the underlying scale of nonlocality is much larger than the hubble scale during inflation .",
    "such constructions evade the no - go theorem of @xcite precisely because they violate the usual assumption of cluster decomposition .",
    "moreover , models of this type are _ not _ subsumed by the general analysis of @xcite since nonlocal field theories with infinitely many derivatives can not be obtained in the regime of low - energy effective field theory .",
    "it is nevertheless sensible to study such constructions since they may be derived from ultra - violet ( uv ) complete frameworks , such as string field theory or @xmath24-adic string theory .",
    "see @xcite for details concerning the underlying consistency of nonlocal field theories and see @xcite for a succinct review of nonlocal cosmology .",
    "a large equilateral bispectrum is typically associated with a small sound speed for the inflaton perturbations @xcite , such as in dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) inflation models @xcite .",
    "however , such a signature may also be obtained in multi - field gelaton @xcite or trapped inflation @xcite models .",
    "the observational bound on equilateral type nongaussianity is @xmath25 at 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "a large flattened bispectrum is associated with non - vacuum initial conditions @xcite . but instead constrain an alternative shape ( the orthogonal model ) which is a superposition of flattened and equilateral shapes . ]",
    "if we relax the assumption that the bispectrum is close to scale invariant then a much richer variety of nongaussian signatures is possible .",
    "for example , in models with sharp steps in the inflaton potential @xcite the bispectrum is large only for triangles with a particular characteristic size .",
    "we will refer to such a signature as a _",
    "localized nongaussian feature_. localized nongaussianities are not well constrained by current observation , but may be observable in future missions .    given the significant role that nongaussianity may play in discriminating between different models of the early universe , it is of crucial importance to explore and classify all possible consistent signatures for the bispectrum and other nongaussian statistics .",
    "indeed , in this review we will describe a new kind of signature  uncorrelated nongaussian features  which is predicted in a variety of simple and well motivated models of inflation , but which has nevertheless been overlooked in previous literature .",
    "recently , a new mechanism for generating cosmological perturbations during inflation was proposed @xcite .",
    "this new mechanism , dubbed _ infra - red ( ir ) cascading _ , is qualitatively different from previous proposals ( such as the curvaton or modulated fluctuations ) in that it does not rely on the quantum vacuum fluctuations of some light scalar fields during inflation .",
    "rather , the scenario involves the production of massive iso - curvature particles _ during _ inflation .",
    "these subsequently rescatter off the slow - roll condensate to generate bremsstrahlung radiation of light inflaton fluctuations ( which induce curvature perturbations and temperature anisotropies in the usual manner ) .",
    "ir cascading can also be distinguished from previous mechanisms from the observational perspective : this new mechanism leads to novel features in both the spectrum and bispectrum .    in principle , ir cascading may occur in any model where non - inflaton ( iso - curvature ) particles are produced during inflation .",
    "models of this type have attracted considerable interest recently ; examples have been studied where particle production occurs via parametric resonance @xcite , as a result of a phase transition @xcite , or otherwise @xcite .",
    "recent interest in inflationary particle production has been stimulated by various considerations :    1 .",
    "particle production arises naturally in a number of microscopically realistic models of inflation , including examples from string theory @xcite and supersymmetric ( susy ) field theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , inflationary particle production is a generic feature of open string inflation models @xcite , such as brane / axion monodromy @xcite .",
    "the energetic cost of producing particles during inflation has a dissipative effect on the dynamics of the inflaton .",
    "particle production may therefore slow the motion of the inflaton , even on a steep potential .",
    "this gives rise to a new inflationary mechanism , called _",
    "trapped inflation _",
    "@xcite , which may circumvent some of the fine tuning problems associated with standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "see @xcite for an explicit string theory realization of trapped inflation and @xcite for a generalization to higher dimensional moduli spaces and enhanced symmetry loci .",
    "the idea of using dissipative dynamics to slow the motion of the inflaton is qualitatively similar to warm inflation @xcite and also to the variant of natural inflation @xcite proposed recently by anber & sorbo @xcite .",
    "3 .   observable features in the primordial power spectrum , generated by particle production and ir cascading , offer a novel example of the non - decoupling of high scale physics in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite . in the most interesting examples ,",
    "the produced particles are extremely massive for ( almost ) the entire history of the universe , however , their effect can not be integrated out due to the non - adiabatic time dependence of the iso - inflaton mode functions during particle production . in @xcite particle production during large field inflation models was proposed as a possible probe of planck - scale physics .    in this article",
    "we study in detail the impact of particle production and ir cascading on the observable primordial curvature perturbations . in order to illustrate the basic physics we focus on a very simple and general prototype model where",
    "the inflaton , @xmath1 , and iso - inflaton , @xmath2 , fields interact via the coupling @xmath26 we expect , however , that our results will generalize in a straightforward way to more complicated models , such as higher spin iso - inflaton fields or gauged interactions , wherein the physics of particle production and rescattering is essentially the same .",
    "our result may also have implications for inflationary phase transitions , because spinodal decomposition can be interpreted as a kind of particle production and similar bi - linear interactions will induce rescattering effects .",
    "scalar field interactions of the type ( [ int ] ) have also been studied recently in connection with non - equilibrium quantum field theory ( qft ) @xcite , in particular with applications to the theory of preheating after inflation @xcite and also moduli trapping @xcite at enhanced symmetry points .",
    "although our focus is on particle production _ during _ inflation ( as opposed to during preheating , after inflation ) some of our results nevertheless have implications for preheating , moduli trapping and also non - equilibrium qft more generally .",
    "for example , in @xcite analytical and numerical studies of rescattering and ir cascading during inflation made it possible to observe , for the first time , the dynamical approach to the turbulent scaling regime that was discovered in @xcite .",
    "particle production during inflation in the model ( [ int ] ) leads to observable features in the primordial power spectrum , @xmath27 .",
    "a number of recent studies have claimed evidence for localized features in @xmath27 that are incompatible with the simplest power - law model @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "although these observed features may simply be statistical anomalies ( see , for example , @xcite ) there remains the tantalizing possibility that they represent some new physics beyond the simplest slow roll model .",
    "upcoming polarization data may play an important role in distinguishing these possibilities @xcite . in the meantime , it is interesting to determine the extent to which such features may be explained by a simple and well motivated model such as ( [ int ] ) .",
    "moreover , because ( [ int ] ) is a complete microscopic model ( as opposed to a phenomenological modification of the power spectrum ) it is possible to predict a host of correlated observables , such as features in the scalar bispectrum and tensor power spectrum .",
    "hence , it should be possible to robustly rule out ( or confirm ! ) the possibility that some massive iso - curvature particles were produced during the observable portion of inflation .",
    "if detected , features from particle production and ir cascading will provide a rare and powerful new window into the microphysics driving inflation .",
    "this scenario opens up the possibility of learning some details about how the inflaton couples to other particles in nature , as opposed to simply reconstructing the inflaton potential along the slow roll trajectory .",
    "moreover , due to the non - decoupling discussed above , features from particle production and ir cascading may probe new ( beyond the standard model ) physics at extraordinarily high energy scales .",

    "note that one might wish to supplement ( [ l ] ) by its supersymmetric completion in order to protect the flatness of the inflaton potential from large radiative corrections coming from loops of the @xmath2 field .",
    "we expect that our results will carry over in a straightforward way to susy models and also to more complicated scenarios such as higher spin iso - inflaton fields and ( possibly ) inflationary phase transitions .",
    "the coupling @xmath39 in ( [ l ] ) is introduced to ensure that the iso - inflaton field can become instantaneously massless at some point @xmath40 along the inflaton trajectory ( which we assume occurs during the observable range of @xmath41-foldings of inflation ) . at this moment @xmath2 particles",
    "will be produced by quantum effects .",
    "let us first consider the homogeneous dynamics of the inflaton field , @xmath3 . near the point",

    "note that , without needing to specify the background inflationary potential @xmath35 , we can write the ratio @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the usual amplitude of the vacuum fluctuations from inflation . in this work",

    "the scenario we have in mind is the following .",
    "inflation starts at some field value @xmath58 and the inflaton rolls toward the point @xmath42 .",
    "initially , the iso - inflaton field is extremely massive @xmath59 and hence it stays pinned in the vacuum , @xmath60 , and does not contribute to super - horizon curvature fluctuations .",
    "eventually , at @xmath45 , the inflaton rolls through the point @xmath40 where @xmath61 and @xmath2 particles are produced . to describe this burst of particle production",

    "the initial conditions for ( [ intro_chi ] ) should be chosen to ensure that the q - number field @xmath2 is in the adiabatic vacuum in the asymptotic past ( see sections [ sec_numerical ] and [ sec_analytical ] for more details ) . in the regime @xmath54 particle production",

    "following the initial burst of particle production there are two distinct physical effects which take place .",
    "first , the energetic cost of producing the gas of massive out - of - equilibrium @xmath2 particles drains energy from the inflaton condensate , forcing @xmath67 to drop abruptly .",
    "this velocity dip is the result of the backreaction of the produced @xmath2 fluctuations on homogeneous condensate @xmath3 .",
    "the second physical effect is that the produced massive @xmath2 particles rescatter off the condensate via the diagram fig .",

    "= 0.25    backreaction and rescattering leave distinct imprints in the observable cosmological perturbations .",
    "let us first discuss the impact of backreaction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dotphi ] we plot the velocity dip resulting from the backreaction of the produced @xmath2 particle on the homogeneous inflaton condensate @xmath3 . from this figure",
    "we see that the quantity @xmath68 becomes large in the dip .",
    "this violation of slow roll is a transient effect ; at late times the produced @xmath2 particles become extremely massive and their number density dilutes as @xmath66",
    ".    one can understand the temporary slowing - down of the inflaton from an analytical perspective .",
    "backreaction is taken into account using the mean - field equation @xmath69 where the vacuum average is computed following @xcite @xmath70 in equation ( [ mean ] ) we have implicitly assumed that the usual coleman - weinberg corrections to the inflaton potential have _ already _ been absorbed into @xmath35 , hence the vacuum average @xmath71 should include _ only _ the effects of non - adiabatic particle production .",

    "[ fig : dotphi ] we have plotted the solution of ( [ mean ] ) along with the exact result obtained from lattice field theory simulations , illustrating the accuracy of this simple treatment .",
    "= 0.4    using the mean field approach , one finds that the transient violation of slow roll leads to a `` ringing pattern '' ( damped oscillations ) in the power spectrum @xmath73 of inflaton fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this ringing pattern is localized around wave - numbers which left the horizon at the moment when particle production occurred .",
    "the effect is very much analogous to fresnel diffraction at a sharp edge .",
    "the second physical effect , rescattering , was considered for the first time in the context of inflationary particle production in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : diag ] illustrates the dominant process : bremsstrahlung emission of long - wavelength @xmath4 fluctuations from rescattering of the produced @xmath2 particles off the condensate .",
    "the time scale for such processes is set by the microscopic scale , @xmath74 , and is thus very short compared to the expansion time , @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , the production of inflaton fluctuations @xmath4 deep in the infra - red ( ir ) is extremely energetically inexpensive , since the inflaton is very nearly massless .",
    "the combination of the short time scale for rescattering and the energetic cheapness of radiating ir @xmath4 leads to a rapid build - up of power in long wavelength inflaton modes : ir cascading .",

    "the bump - like feature from rescattering dominates over the ringing pattern from backreaction for all values of parameters .    in @xcite the model ( [ l ] )",
    "was studied using lattice field theory simulations , without neglecting any physical processes ( that is to say that full nonlinear structure of the theory , including backreaction and rescattering effects , was accounted for consistently ) . however ,",

    "our observational constraints on inflationary particle production may be used to place bounds on parameters of the underlying string model @xcite .    the bump - like feature in @xmath27 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] , must be associated with a nongaussian feature in the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is evident already from inspection of equation ( [ inf_eqn ] ) that the inflaton fluctuations generated by rescattering are significantly nongaussian ; the particular solution of ( [ inf_eqn ] ) is bi - linear in the gaussian field @xmath2 .",

    "the magnitude of this new kind of nongaussianity may be quite large . to quantify the effect it is useful to introduce the probability density function ( pdf ) , @xmath98 , which is the probability that the curvature perturbation has a fluctuation of size @xmath96 .",
    "if we define the central moments of the pdf as @xmath99 then a useful measure of nongaussianity is the dimensionless skewness of the pdf , defined by @xmath100 where the subscript @xmath101 indicates that only the connected part of the correlator should be included .",
    "the skewness @xmath102 encodes information about the bispectrum @xmath15 integrated over all size and shape configurations and thus provides a meaningful single number to compare the nongaussianity of inflation models which may have very different shapes or running @xcite .",
    "if we choose @xmath88 ( which is compatible with observation for all values of @xmath86 ) then the model ( [ l ] ) produces the same value of @xmath102 as a local model ( [ local_f_nl ] ) with @xmath103 .",
    "this large value suggests that nongaussianity from particle production during inflation may be observable in future missions .",
    "depending on model parameters , the nongaussian features predicted by the model ( [ l ] ) may lead to a rich variety of observable consequences for the cmb or large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "the phenomenology of this model is quite different from other constructions that have been proposed to obtain large nongaussianity from inflation .",

    "we can also make a similar schematic decomposition of the bispectrum by considering the structure of the 3-point correlator @xmath386 .",

    "the nongaussian signature predicted by inflationary particle production is rather unusual , as compared to other models of inflation which are frequently studied in the literature .",
    "however , the underlying field theory description is extremely simple and rather generic from the low - energy perspective . in order to obtain observable nongaussianity",
    "it was not necessary to fine - tune the inflaton trajectory or appeal to re - summation of an infinite series of high dimension operators .",
    "indeed , the only `` tuning '' which is required for our signal to be observable is the requirement that @xmath40 during the observable range of @xmath41-foldings .",
    "there are a variety of directions for future studies . from the theoretical perspective",
    ", it would be interesting to explicitly generalize our results to more complicated models with particle production during inflation ( such as susy models , fermion @xmath2 fields and phase transitions ) .",
    "there are also a wide range of interesting phenomenological possibilities . varying the location of the feature we can have a variety of possible signatures for the cmb and lss .",
    "we expect that ir cascading will also have implications for the spectrum of gravity waves from inflation and also primordial black holes .",
    "we can also imagine superposing multiple bursts of particle production to obtain an even richer variety of signatures .",
    "we leave these possibilities for future investigation .",
    "this work has benefited considerably from the interactions with a number of people .",
    "thanks to l.  kofman and d.  pogosian for collaboration on the original paper @xcite which instigated this work .",

    "once @xmath1 rolls past the massless point @xmath42 a gas of @xmath2 particles is produced with occupation number given by ( [ n_k ] ) . this gas costs energy , which must be drained from the condensate @xmath3 .",
    "hence , in order for the system to conserved energy , the inflaton must slow down slightly .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this slowing down can be studied using the mean field equation ( [ mean ] ) . using the solutions ( [ chi_soln ] ) to compute the vacuum average @xmath276 we find @xmath477 the step function @xmath478",
    "reflects the fact that the impact of particle production is felt only _ after _",
    "@xmath1 passes through @xmath86 and @xmath66 comes from the volume dilution of non - relativistic particles . the final term in ( [ mean2 ] )",
    "may be interpreted as a quantum correction to the effective force due to particle production .",
    "( note that we have implicitly subtracted the coleman - weinberg potential , which may be justified by the assumption of softly broken susy . )",
    "the solutions of ( [ mean2 ] ) display the expected slowing - down behaviour and have been studied analytically in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this slowing - down was studied using inhomogeneous lattice field theory simulations and the results were found to be compatible with the mean field treatment ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dotphi ] ) .",
    "here , we consider simple energetic arguments in order to clear up some common misconceptions .",
    "the effective inflaton potential , including the effects of particle production , is @xmath479 for @xmath205 the @xmath2 particles are non - relativistic and their energy density is dominated by potential ( rather than kinetic ) energy .",
    "hence , we have @xmath480 with @xmath481 the number of @xmath41-foldings measured from the moment when @xmath42 .",
    "shortly after particle production this energy density grows , corresponding to the fact that as @xmath1 moves away from @xmath86 the @xmath2 particles become ever more massive .",
    "however , this growth in the energy density can not continue forever . at @xmath482 the energy density @xmath483 peaks and at later times it decays exponentially as @xmath484 , corresponding to the volume dilution of the massive @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the energy density in the produced @xmath2 is always bounded as @xmath485 on the short time scales relevant for particle production , @xmath486 , it is still sensible to talk about energy conservation .",
    "the energy in produced @xmath2 particles must therefore be balanced by a dip in the kinetic energy of the inflaton .",
    "( intuitively this is to be expected since the `` extra '' term in ( [ mean2 ] ) represents a force which tends to pull the inflaton back towards the point @xmath40 . ) to get a sense of the magnitude of this effect , let us compare @xmath483 to the initial kinetic energy of the inflaton @xmath487 using ( [ ratio ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath488 hence , the total energy density that goes into @xmath2 particles is small compared to the inflaton kinetic energy , and hence the velocity dip must also be a small effect , roughly @xmath489 .",
    "this simple estimate is consistent with a more quantitative treatment @xcite .",
    "note that , since inflation is driven by potential energy , we have @xmath490 .",
    "hence , even during particle production the expansion rate @xmath320 will still be dominated by the classical inflaton potential : @xmath491 .",
    "therefore , a single burst of particle production will _ not _ terminate inflation .",
    "nor will this burst de - cohere the condensate since the occupation number of produced particles ( [ n_k ] ) is always less than unity .",
    "( we again remind the reader that , unlike the case of broad band resonant preheating after inflation , we have only a single burst of particle production . )",
    "note that throughout this appendix we are assuming standard slow roll inflation .",
    "in particular , our argument does not apply for trapped inflation @xcite where the effect of backreaction on @xmath320 and @xmath3 is much more significant .",
    "in this appendix we discuss some of the technical details associated with the computation of the renormalized power spectrum ( [ full_pwr_result ] ) .",

    "this is the key simplification which makes an analytical evaluation of this expression tractable .",

    "consider the following integral : @xmath499\\exp\\left[-b\\pi |{\\bf k'}|^2 / k_\\star^2 \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\     & & =   \\frac{k_\\star^3}{(a+b)^{3/2 } } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{ab}{a+b}\\frac{\\pi k^2}{k_\\star^2}\\right ] \\label{phase_identity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula is valid when @xmath500 , @xmath435 are positive real numbers .",
    "notice that this expression is symmetric under interchange of @xmath500 and @xmath435 .",
    "the phase space integral in the first line of ( [ pwr_step ] ) is computed by a trivial application of the identity ( [ phase_identity ] ) : @xmath501 however , the remaining phase space integrals appearing in ( [ pwr_step ] ) can not be obtained exactly in closed form because they contain terms like @xmath502 where the gaussian factors appear under the square root . in order to deal with such expressions , we note because @xmath503 over most of the domain of integration , it is reasonable to replace @xmath504 .",
    "let us now proceed in this manner .",
    "the phase space integral on the second line of ( [ pwr_step ] ) is : @xmath505 \\nonumber \\\\   & & = k_\\star^3 \\left [ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi k^2}{4k_\\star^2}\\right ) + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{3 \\pi k^2}{8k_\\star^2}\\right ) \\right ] \\label{kint2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , consider the phase space integral on the third line of ( [ pwr_step ] ) : @xmath506 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\cong \\int d^3k ' \\left [   n_{k - k'}n_{k'}^{1/2 } + n_{k'}n_{k - k'}^{1/2 }    + \\frac{1}{2 } n_{k - k'}n_{k'}^{3/2 }   + \\frac{1}{2 } n_{k'}n_{k - k'}^{3/2 }        \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\   & & = k_\\star^3 \\left[\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3\\sqrt{3 } } \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi k^2}{3k_\\star^2}\\right )   + \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{5\\sqrt{5 } } \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3 \\pi k^2}{5k_\\star^2}\\right ) \\right ] \\label{kint3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have verified the formulae ( [ kint2],[kint3 ] ) numerically . in both cases that the numerical results agree with these semi - analytical expressions up to the percent level .",

    "<S> in a variety of models the motion of the inflaton may trigger the production of some non - inflaton particles during inflation , for example via parametric resonance or a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> such models have attracted interest recently for a variety of reasons , including the possibility of slowing the motion of the inflaton on a steep potential . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we show that interactions between the produced particles and the inflaton condensate can lead to a qualitatively new mechanism for generating cosmological fluctuations from inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this effect using a simple prototype model @xmath0 for the interaction between the inflaton , @xmath1 , and iso - inflaton , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> such interactions are quite natural in a variety of inflation models from supersymmetry and string theory . using both lattice field theory simulations and analytical calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we study the quantum production of @xmath2 particles and their subsequent rescatterings off the condensate @xmath3 , which generates bremsstrahlung radiation of light inflaton fluctuations @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism leads to observable features in the primordial power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we derive observational constraints on such features and discuss their implications for popular models of inflation , including brane / axion monodromy . </S>",
    "<S> inflationary particle production also leads to a very novel kind of nongaussian signature which may be observable in future missions . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this mechanism provides a simple and well - motivated option to generate large nongaussianity , without fine - tuning the inflationary trajectory or appealing to re - summation of an infinite series of high dimension operators .    </S>",
