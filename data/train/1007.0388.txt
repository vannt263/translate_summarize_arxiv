    "current physical field theories explaining the presently known fundamental interactions are remarkably successful to account for phenomena both on particle physics ( i.e.  @xmath1 m ) and on cosmological ( @xmath2 m ) scales , usually incorporate various fundamental scalar fields ( higgs bosons , axion , supersymmetric partners of fermions , inflaton , waterfall fields etc . ) .",
    "it has been observed since a long time ago that self - interacting scalar fields admit at least up to @xmath3 spatial dimensions spatially localized , oscillating lumps , nowadays called oscillons@xcite .",
    "oscillons are reminiscent of spatially localized , time - periodic breathers known in one dimensional sine - gordon theory .",
    "there is , however , a fundamental difference , in that oscillons are only _ approximatively _ time - periodic since they radiate , thereby losing continuously their energy , albeit very slowly @xcite .",
    "moreover oscillon - type objects exist in a broad class of field theories containing in addition to scalar , vector and possibly other fields @xcite .",
    "a prominent theory admitting classical oscillons is the bosonic sector of the standard model @xcite .",
    "einstein s gravity coupled to a free , massive real klein - gordon field , also possesses oscillon - type solutions , which go under the name of oscillatons @xcite .",
    "an important problem is to investigate the possible pertinence of oscillatons for cosmology where according to current theories some scalars fields are necessarily involved . in recent investigations",
    "the evolution of oscillons in an inflating background has been investigated @xcite .",
    "it has been found that an inflating background also induces a radiative tail in oscillons , _ distinct _ from the one present in flat space - times , leading to an additional leakage of energy .",
    "however this decay rate is also exponentially suppressed , so inflating oscillons may survive for an exponentially long time provided that the horizon is far larger than the width of an oscillon .",
    "as recently shown , due to quantum effects , the decay rate of oscillons becomes power law - like and in many ( but not in all ) cases dominates over the classical decay rate @xcite .",
    "there are indications that oscillons can be copiously produced from thermal initial conditions and a substantial fraction of the energy of the system will be stored by them @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to investigate the physical rle of such long living localized objects . in a cosmological",
    "setting it is necessary to take into account the influence of gravity , i.e.  instead of simply considering oscillons in a background metric , to investigate solutions of the _ coupled einstein - scalar system _  _ oscillatons _  with an expanding , asymptotically homogeneous metric .    in this paper",
    "we undertake a thorough investigation of localized , oscillaton - type solutions in einstein s gravity coupled to a massive klein - gordon field , when space - time undergoes inflation , driven by a negative pressure cosmological fluid ",
    "i.e.  including a cosmological constant , @xmath4 .",
    "( for recent reviews on inflation theory see e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "our results show that once admitting massive scalar fields , both in present day cosmology and in the early universe , spatially localized , very long living oscillatons exist .",
    "the inflaton field generates an energy density of the order of @xmath5 and negative pressure which can be described by an effective ( and slowly varying ) cosmological parameter . using the standard slow roll approximation for the inflaton",
    ", the metric during the inflationary era can be approximated very well with a de sitter one .",
    "the order of magnitude of the cosmological constant during the inflationary epoch is @xmath6 ( in planck units ) .",
    "if other massive scalar fields are present during inflation such as the waterfall - field in hybrid inflationary scenarios @xcite , oscillaton production is expected to be significant .",
    "we find that oscillatons may survive on cosmological time - scales only if the mass of the scalar field is larger than @xmath7 .",
    "the mass loss of an oscillaton during hubble time is completely determined by the ratio @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the energy density due to @xmath10 and @xmath11 is that of the oscillaton in its center .",
    "for example when @xmath12 the mass loss of such a `` waterfall '' oscillaton is of the order of @xmath13 during hubble time .",
    "this mass loss is exponentially decreasing for increasing values of the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "another interesting scenario for oscillaton production is during reheating , assuming that the inflaton field undergoes oscillations near the minimum of its potential .",
    "these oscillatons store a considerable amount of energy and due to parametric resonances induced by quantum effects ( for oscillons this has been shown in ref.@xcite ) they may influence the fluctuation spectrum .    the present value of @xmath14 ( in planck units ) being extremely small , its effect on the mass loss of generic oscillatons is completely negligible on a cosmological time scale . for example if the mass of the scalar field is of the order of @xmath15ev and the amplitude of the oscillaton is approximatively @xmath16 , the effect of the cosmological constant results in a roughly @xmath13 mass loss during the lifetime of the universe .",
    "we also consider ( spherically symmetric ) boson stars @xcite in this setting , i.e.  when a complex scalar field is coupled to gravity with a nonzero cosmological constant .",
    "adopting our small amplitude expansion techniques developed for oscillons and oscillatons we obtain boson star solutions in a systematic way .",
    "remarkably , this method yields very good results even for near maximal mass boson stars .",
    "spatially well localized boson star - type solutions with a static metric , familiar in the case @xmath17 no longer exist when @xmath4 .",
    "there exist , however , radiating boson stars with a time dependent metric loosing continually their mass due to emission of scalar waves .",
    "we obtain their mass loss using our methods developed for oscillons resp .",
