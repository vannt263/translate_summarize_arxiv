    "among the transition metal complexes , octahedral @xmath5 fe@xmath0 molecules are systems of particular interest .",
    "in fact they often undergo the spin - crossover ( sc ) transition @xcite . in their most common form the molecules ground state is a spin singlet ( @xmath6 ) , with the fe six @xmath7 electrons paired up in the @xmath8 antibonding orbitals .",
    "upon increasing the temperature , the high spin quintet state ( @xmath9 ) , in which two electrons are promoted from the @xmath8 to the @xmath10 orbitals , becomes thermodynamically more stable ( see fig .",
    "[ ligand_field ] for the molecular orbital diagram ) .",
    "the sc transition is entropy driven and it is regulated by the difference in the gibbs free energy of the hs and ls states , @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 indicate respectively the enthalpy and the entropy variation ( note that for @xmath14 the ls configuration is more thermodynamically stable than the hs one )",
    ". for sc molecules @xmath15 , but also @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 . hence , for large enough temperatures ( @xmath18 )",
    ", the entropic term dominates over the enthalpic one and the molecules transit from the ls to the hs configuration .",
    "there are two contributions to the entropy : the first is provided by the spin and the second by the molecule vibrations . in fact , the transfer of two electrons to the @xmath10 orbitals , which are more - antibonding than the @xmath8 , weakens the chemical bond and produces a breathing of the metal ion coordination sphere .",
    "this results in a softening of the phonon modes and then an increase of the vibronic entropy .",
    "orbitals of the tm ion have an energy split @xmath19 due to the electrostatic interaction with the ligands .",
    "in contrast , in ligand field theory the @xmath7 orbitals of the tm ion form covalent bonds with the ligands . in this diagram",
    "we assume that each ligand contributes three @xmath20-orbitals , one with the positive lobe pointing toward the tm ion , @xmath21-type , and two with the lobes perpendicular to it , @xmath22-type , ( note that the @xmath21- and @xmath22-type @xmath20 orbitals are degenerate but here they are plotted slightly separated for better display ) .",
    "the @xmath22-type @xmath20 orbitals couple with the tm @xmath23 states , while the @xmath21-type @xmath20 orbitals couple with the @xmath24 .",
    "since the @xmath22 interaction is weaker than the @xmath21 one , the antibonding @xmath25 orbitals lie lower in energy than the @xmath26 ones .",
    "the energy splitting between the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 orbitals is indicated by @xmath27 . ]",
    "the sc transition is usually reported either for molecules in solution or in single crystals and , depending on the strength and on the origin of the inter - molecular interactions , it can have cooperative nature and present a thermal hysteresis loop .",
    "interestingly , the transition can be also induced by illumination .",
    "this phenomenon is called liesst effect ( light - induced - excited - spin - state - trapping ) and it is explained through a mechanism involving several excited states @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of the metastable hs state is usually very long at low temperature as the relaxation to the ground state is due to the weak electronic coupling between these states @xcite .",
    "the opposite process , in which molecules populating the metastable hs state are brought back to their ground state , is also possible and it is called reverse liesst effect .    although , sc molecules have been traditionally studied for possible applications in storage and sensor devices @xcite , they have recently emerged as promising materials for molecular spintronics @xcite . in fact , the electronic transport through these molecules has been predicted @xcite and experimentally reported @xcite to depend strongly on their spin state .",
    "given such renewed interest in spin crossover compounds there is also a growing fundamental effort in modeling their properties . in this respect one",
    "aims at using an electronic structure theory , which is at the same time accurate and scalable .",
    "accuracy is needed for reliable predictions of the spin crossover temperature , while scalability is required by the size of the typical molecules .",
    "this becomes particularly crucial for molecules in in crystals and when deposited on metallic surfaces , since the typical simulation cells are large .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) is in principle both scalable and accurate , but to date it is completely unclear how it does perform relatively to this problem .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the performance of dft against four model fe@xmath0 ions , namely [ fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 , [ fe(nh@xmath3)@xmath2@xmath0 , [ fe(nch)@xmath2@xmath0 and [ fe(co)@xmath2@xmath0 .",
    "in particular we answer to the question on which exchange - correlation functional performs best . as",
    "no experimental data are available for these ions we benchmark against diffusion quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results .",
    "note that often experimental data are difficult to compare with microscopic theory , so that our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the theory itself , which is probably more informative than a simple comparison to experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present an overview of the problem and of the various known shortcomings of dft , and we discuss critically which elements one has to consider when comparing electronic structure data to experiments",
    ". then we will provide some computational details and move to the results .",
    "first we will discuss our dft calculations for the four different ions and then we will compare them with the qmc ones .",
    "finally we will conclude .",
    "represents all the 3@xmath28 nuclear coordinates of the molecule .",
    "the zero point phonon energies for the hs and ls state , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the adiabatic energy gap , @xmath31 , and the vertical energy gaps , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are indicated . ]",
    "when we consider a single molecule in vacuum at zero temperature @xmath34 coincides with the internal energy difference , which reads in the adiabatic approximation as @xmath35 here , @xmath36 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the zero - point phonon energy of the hs ( ls ) state , while @xmath37 is the adiabatic energy difference ( often called `` adiabatic energy gap '' ) .",
    "the collective coordinate @xmath38 represents the @xmath39 nuclear coordinates of the molecule and the energies @xmath40 and @xmath41 define the potential energy surfaces ( pess ) respectively of the hs and ls state ( see fig .  [ adia_pic ] ) .",
    "in addition to the adiabatic energy gap we can also define the vertical energy difference ( `` vertical energy gap'')@xcite @xmath42 and the difference of vertical energy gaps ( dog ) @xcite : @xmath43 all of these quantities can be computed by using _",
    "ab - initio _ electronic structure methods . as we mentioned in the introduction , dft is always the preferred one .",
    "in fact sc molecules are composed of , at least , fifty atoms and a good balance between expected accuracy and computational cost is required . however , there are many issues connected to the dft description of sc molecules , which either have not been properly addressed or have not found any satisfactory solution yet . here",
    "we list some of them .    * * the functional dilemma*. for each fe@xmath0 molecules , in general , every exchange - correlation functional returns a very different adiabatic energy gap ( see for example references @xcite ) .",
    "these differences can be as large as few ev and different functionals do not sometimes even predict the same @xmath31 sign . in a nutshell ,",
    "no agreement around which functional performs best has been reached so far ( the discussion below will explain how problematic is a direct assessment of the dft results through a comparison with the experimental data ) .",
    "however , some general trends , which relate functionals belonging to the same `` class '' ( or the same `` rung '' if we refer to the `` jacob s ladder '' @xcite classification scheme ) , have been identified .",
    "+ \\1 ) _ the local density approximation ( lda ) ( first rung ) tends to stabilize the ls state_. this is due to the underestimation of the exchange energy @xcite . in particular , the exchange keeps electrons of like - spin apart so that their coulomb repulsion is reduced .",
    "therefore , the exchange underestimation is accompanied by the overestimation of the coulomb energy for two electrons of equal spin .",
    "this , in turns , leads to the stabilization of the ls state at the expense of the hs state .",
    "+ \\2 ) _ the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and the meta - ggas ( second and third rungs ) @xcite give results that depend on the specific compound and on the exact dft conditions that each functional satisfies_. `` traditional '' ggas , such as the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite and the blyp , which combines the becke exchange @xcite with the lee - yang - parr ( lyp ) correlation @xcite , reduce only slightly the lda over - stabilization of the ls state .",
    "therefore they do not represent a drastic improvement .",
    "in contrast , some more recent gga functionals , such as the olyp ( combining the handy and cohen s optx exchange @xcite with the lyp correlation ) , have been claimed to perform rather well @xcite . among the meta - ggas , the van voorhis - scuseria exchange - correlation ( vsxc ) functional @xcite was tested by ganzenmller et al .",
    "@xcite , who concluded that it provided quite accurate results for single - point calculations , while it predicted artificially twisted structures .",
    "+ \\3 ) _ hybrid functionals ( forth rung ) tend to favor the hs with respect to ls one_. reiher and co - workers @xcite argued that the amount of hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange in many hybrid functionals is too large to predict correct energy gaps .",
    "they then proposed a re - parametrization of the b3lyp functional @xcite , called b3lyp@xmath44 , which includes only @xmath45 of hf exchange ( in contrast to the standard b3lyp @xmath46 ) .",
    "although b3lyp@xmath44 is believed to give satisfactory results for several sc complexes , some studies suggested that a further reduction of the hf exchange could be needed in order to describe others fe@xmath0 compounds @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the amount of hf exchange in b3lyp was judged insufficient for the small ions [ fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 and [ fe(nh@xmath3)@xmath2@xmath0 . for these systems",
    "it has been claimed that pbe0 @xcite , which includes up to @xmath47 of hf exchange , gives more satisfactory results @xcite . in practice , for each compound , the amount of hf exchange can be varied to fit the desired values for the gaps but no `` universally good choice '' has been identified so far .",
    "the dependence of the adiabatic energy gap on the amount of hf and either of lda ( slater ) or gga ( b88 and optx ) exchange is explained very clearly in the work of ganzenmller et al .",
    "finally it is important to remark that , even when a certain hybrid functional is found to return satisfactory energy gaps , it might not be the optimal functional to describe other properties of the molecule . * * basis set*. dft calculations for sc molecules are usually performed by using quantum chemistry codes , where the wave - function is expanded over either gaussian ( gtos ) or slater - type orbitals ( stos )  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the values of the energy gaps depend substantially on the choice of the basis sets and on the spatial extension of the local orbitals @xcite .",
    "although this is a less severe problem compared to that of identifying the exchange - correlation functional , it must be kept into consideration . in principle , the use of plane - waves basis sets @xcite , instead of gtos and stos , could be a solution , but in practice plane - wave calculations are are computationally expensive because of the need of satisfying periodic boundary conditions . +",
    "a large number of plane - waves is usually needed as the electronic density is concentrated in a small fraction of the supercell volume .",
    "furthermore very large supercells are typically required .",
    "this is due to the fact that sc complexes are often 2 + ions .",
    "therefore a negatively charged background must be introduced in order to preserve the overall charge neutrality so that the total energy remains bound .",
    "the energy calculated in this way approaches then the one for an isolated system only in the limit of large supercell and , unfortunately , such convergence is slow .",
    "although corrections to the expression of the computed energy have been proposed @xcite , this effect can be properly accounted for only by considering large supercells and by performing multiple calculations for supercells of different sizes . *",
    "* geometry optimization*. each class ( rung ) of exchange - correlation functionals returns different metal - ligands bond - lengths .",
    "usually , lda gives shorter bonds than hybrids functionals , while standard gga results are in between these two extremes @xcite .",
    "although these differences are usually quite small , less then @xmath48   against an average bond - length of about @xmath49  , they might strongly affect the electronic properties .",
    "indeed a very delicate balance between ligand - field splitting and hund s coupling establishes the spin state ( see fig .",
    "[ ligand_field ] ) .",
    "then , small errors in the predicted geometries can drastically alter this balance .",
    "+ unfortunately , the quality of the dft relaxation can not be easily assessed through a comparison with available experiments .",
    "in fact , while dft calculations are usually carried out for molecules in the gas phase , the experimental geometries are obtained through x - ray measurements for crystals @xcite . as far as we know",
    ", no detailed dft studies about sc molecules in the condensed phase have been published so far .",
    "furthermore , such a study must face the additional difficulty of the need of accounting for inter - molecular interactions .",
    "these have usually dispersive nature and , therefore , they are either not described or badly - described by most of the popular functionals @xcite . * * electrostatic contributions to the total energy*. sc molecules , which are usually in the 2 + charging state , are surrounded by counter - ions ( for example [ pf@xmath2@xmath50 or [ bf@xmath51@xmath50 ) . because of the electrostatic potential generated by such counter - ions and by the other molecules in the crystal , the total energy of a sc complex in the condensed phase differs from that in the gas phase .",
    "furthermore , since at the sc phase transition there is a charge redistribution over the individual molecules and a lattice expansion , such electrostatic potential does not induce a simple rigid shift of the minima of the hs and ls pess ( compared to those calculated for the gas phase ) .",
    "the energy gap then turns out to be different for the same molecule in different phases @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this effect is always neglected by dft calculations , which aim at assessing the performances of dft by using experimental data . * * finite - temperature effects*. special care should be taken in order to include finite - temperature effects when comparing dft to experiments .",
    "in fact , at finite temperature instead of the adiabatic energy gap , the gibbs free energy , eq .",
    "( [ deltag ] ) , must be computed .",
    "so far , this has been attempted only by ganzenmller et al .",
    "however , unfortunately , their calculations did not fully account for either the electrostatic contribution to the total energy or the effect of the periodic lattice on the molecular structure .",
    "this list clearly emphasizes how the main handicap in the theoretical description of sc complexes is related to the difficulties in assessing the performances of any given exchange - correlation functional .",
    "any benchmark involving a comparison against experimental results is fated to fail , unless vibrational , environmental , crystallographic and finite - temperature effects are properly accounted for .",
    "however , this task is at present too demanding to be practically achievable .",
    "in contrast , as pointed out by fouqueau et al .",
    "@xcite , the current best strategy consists in providing benchmark values for various interesting quantities through highly accurate _",
    "ab - initio _ methods .",
    "these can then be compared with the dft results in order to identify which functional performs better .",
    "in some interesting works @xcite , wave - function based methods were considered ( see discussion below ) . however , unfortunately , the authors themselves admitted that their results were plagued by a number of systematic errors .",
    "these were ascribed to the too small basis set used for the fe@xmath0 ion and to the fact that such computational methods describe exactly only for static electronic correlation , but do not include the dynamic one , which , however , can be partially included by perturbation theory . + here we have chosen to employ as benchmark electronic structure theory diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) @xcite .",
    "this represents one of the most accurate computational techniques to calculate the energy of a quantum system and it is able to return up to @xmath52 of the correlation energy ( including both static and dynamic contributions ) .",
    "in this work , we compare systematically several dmc results to those obtained with dft for a few selected fe@xmath0 complexes . unfortunately",
    ", such a systematic investigation requires a large use of computational resources and , therefore , it can not be carried out for molecules composed of tens of atoms ( such as the most typical sc complexes ) .",
    "we have then focused our attention on the following ions : [ fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 , [ fe(nh@xmath3)@xmath2@xmath0 , [ fe(nch)@xmath2@xmath0 and [ fe(co)@xmath2@xmath0 , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_small_molecules ] .",
    "these are small enough to allow several dmc calculations to be performed at a reasonable computational cost . furthermore , and more importantly",
    ", the study of their electronic structure presents all the problems mentioned above so that our main conclusions can be extended to large sc molecules as well . finally , according to the spectrochemical series @xcite",
    ", these ions have a different ligand field splitting .",
    "the one of [ fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 is the smallest and that of [ fe(co)@xmath2@xmath0 the largest .",
    "we then expect that fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 , [ fe(nh@xmath3)@xmath2@xmath0 and [ fe(nch)@xmath2@xmath0 have a hs ground state , while [ fe(co)@xmath2@xmath0 a ls one .",
    "therefore , our study scans through systems of different ground state spin multiplicity , it reveals general trends and it points to the systematic errors of each dft functional .",
    "dft calculations are performed with the nwchem package @xcite .",
    "we use several functionals belonging to different `` classes '' : 1 ) the default lda of vosko - wilk - nussair @xcite , 2 ) the gga bp86 functional , which combines the becke88 exchange functional @xcite with the predew86 correlation one @xcite and 3 ) the hybrid functionals b3lyp @xcite , pbe0 @xcite and the becke `` half and half '' ( becke - hh )  @xcite . these include respectivelly @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath4 of hf exchange (",
    "note that , in the nwchem package , only an approximate version of the hh - becke functional is currently implemented @xcite ) .",
    "we have chosen three different basis sets : 1 ) 6 - 31 g * ( basis set called a ) , 2 ) the lanl2dz basis set and pseudopotential @xcite for fe combined with the basis set 6 - 31++g * * for all other atoms ( basis set b ) and 3 ) the triple - zeta polarized basis set of ahlrichs @xcite ( basis set c ) . geometry optimizations are performed both with and without specifying the molecule point group .",
    "the geometries optimized with these two strategies usually return consistent results with bond - lengths differences , which are within @xmath53 .",
    "we always check that the phonon frequencies are all real so that the final geometries correspond to stable energy minima .",
    "dmc calculations are performed by using the casino code @xcite .",
    "the imaginary time evolution of the schrdinger equation has been performed with the usual short time approximation and time - steps of various sizes are considered ( typically @xmath54 a.u . ) .",
    "expect for few cases , the energy differences are usually found to be converged with respect to the time - step errors already for @xmath55 a.u .",
    "calculations are performed by using dirac - fock pseudopotentials @xcite with the `` potential localization approximation '' ( pla ) @xcite . for [ fe(nch)@xmath2@xmath0 dmc simulations with this approximation",
    "are found to be unstable as the number of walkers `` explodes '' .",
    "therefore we have used instead the `` t - move '' scheme @xcite , which eliminates the need of the pla and treats the non - local part of the pseudopotential in a way consistent with the variational principle .",
    "the simulations then become more stable .",
    "the single - particle orbitals of the trial wave function are obtained through ( lda ) dft calculations performed with the plane - wave ( pw ) code quantum espresso @xcite .",
    "the same pseudopotentials used for the dmc calculations are employed .",
    "the pw cutoff is fixed at @xmath56 ry and the pw are re - expanded in terms of b - splines @xcite .",
    "the b - spline grid spacing is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the length of the largest vector employed in the pw calculations .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are employed for the pw - dft calculations and supercells as large as @xmath59     are considered .",
    "in contrast , no periodic boundary conditions are imposed for the dmc simulations .",
    "dmc calculations are performed for the molecular geometries previously optimized by dft .",
    "therefore we can compare the dmc energies of molecular structures obtained by employing different functionals and basis sets .",
    "however , for each system , these energy differences are often smaller than the computed error bars .",
    "only lda systematically returns molecular geometries with much higher dmc energies than those obtained by using either gga or hybrid functionals .",
    "the lower energy geometry of [ fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 is found to have @xmath61 symmetry for both bp86 and hybrid functionals .",
    "this is consistent with the results of pierloot et al .",
    "in contrast , with lda , we were able to obtain relaxed atomic positions for both the hs and ls states only by using the the basis set a and without specifying the molecule point group .",
    "as expected from our introductory discussion , the molecule in the ls state has metal - ligand bond - lengths shorter than those of the molecule in hs state ( by about @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , the details of the geometry depend on both the functional and the basis set .",
    "this can be clearly seen by inspecting tab .",
    "[ tab_bond_1 ] , which reports a full list of the calculated fe - o bond - lengths for both the hs and ls states . on the one hand , lda overbinds the molecule as compared to gga and hybrids .",
    "on the other hand , the basis set a tends to shrink the fe - o bond - lengths when compared to the basis set b and c. although the choice of basis set does not affect the bond - lengths as drastically as the functional does , it still influences the geometry greatly .",
    "the calculations performed with the basis set a return a quite large inclination ( about @xmath63 degrees ) of the o - fe - o axis with respect to the @xmath64 degrees angle it forms with the equatorial plane of the molecule . furthermore , for basis set a and b , either the axial waters , which form the ligands , move `` in '' and the equatorial waters move `` out '' of their plane or viceversa . these results do not depend qualitatively on the functional .",
    "in contrast , the inclination of the o - fe - o axis and the distortion of axial waters disappears when the calculations are carried out by using the basis set c.    tab .",
    "[ tab_dft_mine_1 ] shows our calculated values for the adiabatic energy gaps , where a positive ( negative ) energy means that the ls state has lower ( higher ) energy than that of the hs one . for each functional ,",
    "our results are always in very close agreement with those obtained by other authors @xcite ( the results are presented in @xmath65 as well as in ev in order to allow for a better comparison with the various values found in literature ) . here",
    "we can distinguish a clear trend , summarized by the series : @xmath66 this suggests that the calculated @xmath31 is strictly related to the amount of hf exchange incorporated into the given functional . by increasing such contribution",
    ", we systematically stabilize the hs configuration with respect to the ls one .",
    ".bond - lengths of [ fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 in the hs and ls state , as calculated with various functionals and basis sets .",
    "note that the lda calculations for the hs state did not coverge in the case of the basis set b and c. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      so far we have focused only on the adiabatic energy gaps .",
    "however the expression for the internal energy difference , eq .",
    "( [ delta_e_int ] ) , contains also a contribution coming from the phonon zero point energies .",
    "table  [ tab_phonon_diff ] displays @xmath67 , calculated by using the various functionals ( the results are shown only for the basis set c ) .",
    "@xmath67 is found to be always negative ( i.e. the zero point energy of the hs state is lower than that of the ls one ) reflecting the weaker fe - ligand bond of the hs configuration .",
    "corrections to the total energy of the two states then always tend to stablilise the hs .",
    "in contrast to the adiabatic energy gap , @xmath67 is found to be almost functional independent .",
    "indeed , for a given system , the difference between two values of @xmath67 obtained with two different functionals , are never larger than 15  mev .",
    "this demonstrates that the curvature of the pess is usually very well reproduced by every functional .",
    "therefore the spread in the predicted values of @xmath31 must arise from the relative shift of the pes of one spin state with respect to that of the other .",
    "this observation is consistent with the results by zein et al .",

    "unfortunately in most cases the dmc energies have a statistical error not small enough to firmly establish which functional returns the lowest energy structure of a given complex ( only the lda molecular structures have systematically higher energies , but this is not surprising since the analysis of the phonon modes revealed that these structures are not even associated to a stable minimum of the lda total energy ) .",

    "this indicates that the exchange and correlation energies have different relative importance for the hs and the ls compounds . in order to better understand this important observation ,",

    "this indicates that the correlation contribution to the total energy is well described with ( semi-)local functionals and the failures in predicting @xmath31 could be entirely ascribed to the underestimation of the exchange energy .",

    "the dft performances for the three hs ions and [ fe(co)@xmath2@xmath0 is related to the different nature of their ground state wave - function . in fact",
    ", this was found to have a much more pronounced multi - configurational character in [ fe(co)@xmath2@xmath0 than in all the other complexes @xcite , reflecting the increase in the covalency of the metal - ligand bonds @xcite . based on this observation",
    ", one can reasonably argue that , for the hs complexes the local - part of the exchange - correlation functional is able to capture most of the correlation energy , while the fraction of hf exchange effectively cures the lda underestimation of the exchange .",
    "thus hybrid functionals with `` enough '' hf exchange are found to systematically return quite satisfactory results .",
    "furthermore , as the failures of standard gga functionals seem mostly related to the shortcomings in the description of the exchange energy , recent gga functionals , constructed in order to tackle this issue , can out - perform .",
    "for example , the olyp functional , whose exchange part ( optx ) is parametrized to reproduce the hartree - fock exchange for atoms @xcite , predicts values for the adiabatic energy gap of [ fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 and [ fe(nh@xmath3)@xmath2@xmath0 , which compare well with those computed with either b3lyp or pbe0 @xcite .",
    "unfortuantelly , however , olyp is not as accurate as the hybrids for predicting geometry optimizations and bond - lengths @xcite .",
    "another of such gga functionals , which was found to perform at the level of the hybrids ( if not even better ) @xcite , is the hcth407 @xcite .",
    "our own results are then listed in tab .",
    "[ tab_gga ] . the massive improvement , that olyp and hcth407 have achieved , over bp86 , is evident in the case of fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 , [ fe(nh@xmath3)@xmath2@xmath0 and [ fe(nch)@xmath2@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , one can question whether [ fe(co)@xmath2@xmath0 can be described at all by the single - determinant picture provided by dft . in principle , the multiconfigurational nature of a wave - function can be described by gga functionals . in fact the gga exchange roughly mimics the non - dynamical correlation ( in addition to the proper exchange ) @xcite . in practice , however , no dft flavour investigated here has proven fairly accurate for the energetic of the ion [ fe(co)@xmath2@xmath0 .",
    "[ tab_cation_2 ]    finally we compare our dmc results to those obtained with wave - function based methods .",
    "fouqueau et al .",
    "@xcite carried out several calculations for the adiabatic energy gap of the ions [ fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 and [ fe(nh@xmath3)@xmath2@xmath0 by using the complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) method with second order perturbative corrections ( caspt2 ) .",
    "some of the results are summarized in tabs .",
    "[ tab_cation_1_wf ] and [ tab_cation_2_wf ] . as observed by the authors themselves and in ref .",
    "@xcite , these calculations suffer the drawback of having been carried out with an insufficient fe basis set . as such they are affected by a systematic error , which can be estimated by considering the @xmath70 splitting of the free fe@xmath0 ion .",
    "an empirical correction of the order of @xmath71 was then introduced . in the same works ,",
    "results obtained by spectroscopy - oriented configuration - interaction ( sorci ) , were also reported .",
    "these were stated not to require any empirical correction .",
    "a second set of results is provided by pierloot et al .",
    "@xcite , who performed calculations with basis sets of larger size . for [ fe(nh@xmath3)@xmath2@xmath0",
    ", their best caspt2 adiabatic gap agrees fairly well with the corrected - caspt2 and sorci results .",
    "however for [ fe(h@xmath1o)@xmath2@xmath0 , they found a significantly larger ( in absolute value ) @xmath31 .    by analyzing the data in tabs .",
    "[ tab_cation_1_wf ] and [ tab_cation_2_wf ] , we note that the adiabatic energy gaps calculated with caspt2 by fouqueau et al .",
    "@xcite agree fairly well with our dmc ones ( in particular for [ fe(nh@xmath3)@xmath2@xmath0 ) .",
    "in contrast , the empirical corrections worsen the agreement and the sorci results do not agree quantitatively with ours .",
    "although we have not achieved yet a complete understanding of these differences , we argue that they may originate from the large dependence of the casscf / cast2 results on the basis sets and on the orbitals included in the active space .",
    "furthermore wave - function based methods do not describe dynamic electronic correlations ( although partial corrections are provided by the second order perturbation theory ) .",
    "the dmc energies , in turns , might depend on the choice of the trial wave - function introduced to impose the fixed - node approximation @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis on the sources of potential errors in dmc is currently on the way .",
    "in this work , we have assessed the performances of several popular exchange - correlation functionals in describing various fe@xmath0 complexes . as dft results can not be easily related to experiments ( at least without accounting for environmental and finite - temperature effects ) , we have performed accurate dmc calculations , which provide a solid theoretical benchmark for the theory . the dft and dmc results , both obtained within the theoretical framework of the adiabatic approximation , could be then directly compared .",
    "the lda and the standard gga functionals drastically over - stabilize the ls state .",
    "although the accuracy of the dft calculations increases when hybrid functionals are employed , the most popular ones , b3lyp and pbe0 , provide results , which are still quantitatively unsatisfactory . in the case of hs ions , a fair agreement between the dft and the dmc adiabatic gaps is achieved only by using about @xmath4 of hf exchange .",
    "in contrast , a lower fraction of hf exchange ( between @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) is required for [ fe(co)@xmath2@xmath0 .",
    "this difference might be related to the diverse nature of the ground state wave - function for the hs and ls ions . therefore ,",
    "unfortunately , we have to conclude that there is not yet a `` universal '' functional able to correctly describe the energetics of every fe@xmath0 complex .    finally , by analyzing zero - point phonon energies",
    ", we have demonstrated that the shape of the pess is well described by every functional considered .",
    "therefore , as already pointed out by zein et al .",
    "@xcite , the failures of dft in calculating the adiabatic energy gaps must be ascribed to a shift of the pes of the ls state with respect to that of the hs state .",
