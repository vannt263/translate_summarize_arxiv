    "studies of large - scale structures in the universe and fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background strongly favor a @xmath10-cold dark matter ( @xmath10cdm ) cosmology ( e.g. , cole et al .",
    "2005 ; dunkley et al .",
    "the formation of structures in this cosmology is a process of hierarchical clustering , in the sense that numerous cdm lumps cluster gravitationally and merge together to form larger structures ( white & rees 1978 ; blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 ) .",
    "dark halos of galaxy systems are similarly formed via clustering of subhalos as a result of cdm agglomerations that reach the maximum expansion then turn around to collapse in the background expanding medium , but a detailed process leading to the halo formation from primordial density fluctuations is highly nonlinear and is not as simple as the formation of larger structures in the universe ( e.g. , for review see ostriker 1993 and bertschinger 1998 ) .",
    "high - resolution @xmath10cdm simulations for the halo formation generically show that mergers and collisions of subhalos induce the overall collapse and virialize the inner region of host halo , while surviving subhalos orbit as separate entities within the inner virialized region of halo ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "1999 ; ghigna et al .",
    "2000 ; helmi , white & springel 2003 ; valluri et al .",
    "a majority of stars formed through this build - up of halo are expected to have also experienced the redistribution of energy and momentum that drives the phase mixing or violent relaxation towards the dynamical equilibrium ( lynden - bell 1967 ) .",
    "this leads to an idea that a stellar halo , which can be regarded as a collisionless system , holds the dynamical information just after the last violent relaxation in forming the halo .",
    "we then take an approach to find out the relics of the formation of the milky way halo from the kinematics of halo stars . among many of their kinematic properties",
    "available at present and in the near future , the differential distribution of stellar orbital eccentricity @xmath11 seems to be of special importance .",
    "the orbital eccentricity of a star is a quasi - adiabatic invariant ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ; lynden - bell 1963 ) and is unaffected by the small and slow variation of the gravitational potential that might have occurred after the major formation of halo stars .",
    "it is therefore most likely that the shape of @xmath11 has been conserved until present . with this consideration , comparing the observed shape of @xmath11 for halo stars with the theoretical one for the halo in dynamical equilibrium , we could explore how far out in the halo the dynamical equilibrium was achieved .",
    "consequently , @xmath11 serves as a new test of halo formation scenario in a @xmath10cdm cosmology .    as a useful way to derive @xmath11 theoretically",
    ", we consider the orbit of halo stars in assumed gravitational potentials of the halo . in section 2",
    ", we present our formulation to calculate @xmath11 under some plausible assumptions for the halo , and apply it to two extreme gravitational potentials of academic interest .",
    "the results for realistic cases are shown for the isochrone potential and for the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) potential in section 3 .",
    "we summarize the results and discuss the prospects of investigating the formation and evolution of the milky way halo in section 4 .",
    "we assume that the halo stars constitute a spherical , collisionless system in dynamical equilibrium with a dark halo . since the dark matter is known to dominate the total mass of the galaxy system , the motion of halo stars is governed by the gravitational potential of dark halo .",
    "when a spherical halo potential @xmath12 is given with respect to the galaxy center , the energy @xmath1 and the angular momentum @xmath2 of a star at the position @xmath13 with the velocity @xmath14 are written respectively as @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the orbital eccentricity of a star is practically defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the apo- and peri - centric distances , respectively , and are given by two real solutions ( @xmath20 ) of the following equation : @xmath21 it is evident from equations ( [ e - def ] ) and ( [ eq_r1r2 ] ) that a pair of @xmath22 has a one - to - one correspondence to @xmath23 , but there is a region of @xmath22 in which two real solutions are not allowed and thus , except for the case of circular orbits , the eccentricity can not be defined . since such unbound orbits do not form a steady population of stellar halo , we neglect them and exclusively consider stars with bound orbits .",
    "constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath2 that allow bound orbits are presented in appendix a.      let @xmath24 be the distribution function of halo stars , then the number of halo stars in a phase space volume @xmath25 centered at @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 . according to the strong jeans theorem , the distribution function",
    "should be expressed in terms of isolating integrals only ( lynden - bell 1960 , 1962 ) . for a spherical system that is invariant under rotation",
    ", it takes a form of either @xmath28 or @xmath3 , depending on whether the stellar velocity dispersion is isotropic or anisotropic , respectively .",
    "the velocity dispersion observed for halo stars is radially anisotropic ( e.g. , yoshii & saio 1979 ; gilmore , wyse , & kuijken 1989 ) .",
    "furthermore , recent observations for halo stars within the distance of @xmath29 away from us show that the shape of velocity ellipsoid is constant and its principal axes are well aligned with the spherical coordinates ( carollo et al . 2007 ; bond et al .",
    "if we extrapolate this fact to a whole system , one simple form of the distribution function is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a function of @xmath1 ( e.g. , binney & tremine 2008 ) . here , @xmath4 is a constant value of velocity anisotropy parameter defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the radial velocity dispersion and @xmath34 is the tangential velocity dispersion projected onto the spherical @xmath35 surface .",
    "although @xmath4 is about @xmath36 observationally ( e.g. , bond et al .",
    "2009 ; smith et al . 2009 ; carollo et al .",
    "2010 ) , we will use it as a constant parameter below .    by changing the variables and integrating over the spherical coordinates ,",

    "thus , once the gravitational potential @xmath12 and the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath4 are specified , we can formally obtain @xmath43 , and also @xmath42 after integrating @xmath43 over @xmath1 with its appropriate weight .      in this subsection , mostly for pedagogical purpose",
    ", we consider two extreme cases of mass distribution such as the point mass at the center and the homogeneous distribution in the truncated sphere .",
    "these cases allow analytic expression of @xmath43 , and because it is separable in @xmath1 and @xmath0 , @xmath42 can also be obtained except for its normalization . therefore , these cases are helpful to understand the results for any more realistic cases .",

    "we should notice that the linear trend of @xmath61 prevails in a range of @xmath62 regardless of @xmath4 , while the behavior of @xmath42 is very sensitive to @xmath4 in a range of @xmath63 and the difference there clearly shows up .",

    "overall behavior monotonically increases with @xmath0 in a range of @xmath83 , and is kept more or less flat in the range of @xmath84 . for @xmath85 , @xmath42 is a rapidly increasing function of @xmath0 .    for a given value of @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath42 is more weighted at smaller @xmath0 in the homogeneous model , when compared with the point mass model .",

    "this sensitivity , though between two extreme cases , could be used to discriminate the likely mass distribution in more realistic cases to be considered in section 3 .      in the cases of central point mass and truncated homogeneous sphere ,",

    "this trend is also true regardless of the value of @xmath4 and is helpful in interpreting the results of more realistic models in the next section .     for four types of model potentials , when the stellar velocity dispersion is isotropic ( @xmath56 ) .",

    "our formulation in the previous section can apply to more general cases of mass distribution , including the isochrone model and the nfw model that could form two ends covering in - between any realistic cases of mass distribution of dark halo .",

    "thus , this model , though not explaining the flat rotation curve of the galaxy disk at greater distances from the galaxy center , is important to study the intermediate case of mass distribution by adjusting the scale size of the central core .",

    "we can imagine that halo stars traveling far distantly from the galaxy center with near - zero energy would be captured by adjacent dark halo .",

    "thus , it is reasonable to place @xmath154 at @xmath159 and assume that while halo stars with @xmath160 stay in the system , those with @xmath161 could be unbound and leave the system .    from all these considerations ,",

    "the shape of @xmath42 is almost the same as that of @xmath172 .",
    "this is because @xmath172 significantly contributes to the integration of @xmath173 .",
    "for example , in a particular case of @xmath56 for the isochrone model , we clearly see such a situation from the explicit expression : @xmath174    using the typical combinations of @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 that more or less agree with observations of the milky way halo , the results of @xmath42 for both the isochrone and nfw models are shown in figure [ fig isochrone+nfw - n ] .",
    "we see from this figure that as far as reasonable values of @xmath4 and @xmath169 are adopted , the resulting shape of @xmath42 should be almost linearly proportional to @xmath0 , except for the deviation only at @xmath179 .",
    "this is largely regardless of adopting either the isochrone model or the nfw model .",
    "thus , if the dominant component of the milky way halo is in dynamical equilibrium , the total eccentricity distribution of stellar halo is expected to have a linear trend at @xmath180 similar to our results . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of predicted @xmath11 at @xmath179 , which still shows little difference between the isochrone and nfw models , is sensitive to @xmath4 and @xmath181 .",
    "consequently , such sensitivity can be used for a consistency check of the assumed form of @xmath3 .",
    "these predictions in the separate regions of @xmath180 and @xmath179 are testable , given that large kinematical data of halo stars are available at present from the segue project or in the near future from the gaia project .",
    "hierarchical clustering scenarios of galaxy formation suggest that the major merger of at least several subhalos with comparable masses would occur at the last stage of galaxy formation .",
    "this last major merger would cause the violent relaxation of halo stars and make them in dynamical equilibrium with a dark halo . based on the assumptions that approximate such a status just after the last violent relaxation ( section [ intro ] )",
    ", we have presented theoretical predictions of @xmath11 for halo stars .",
    "this predicted @xmath11 should be observed for the milky way halo if it is an isolated system and the subsequent variation of the potential is quiescent enough to conserve the eccentricity of each star .",
    "however , recent nearby observations suggest that at least some part of the milky way halo may have originated from accreted satellites , which possibly deviates the observed @xmath11 from our predictions . for example , if infalling satellites break up and spread their member stars into the field , these stars would show peculiar eccentricity distribution which necessarily imprints the initial condition of the progenitor satellites .",
    "in addition , if such satellites locally disturb the halo potential , some _ in - situ _ halo stars may have altered their orbits ( e.g. zolotov et al .",
    "2009 ) . with an invention of segregating _ in - situ _ halo stars from infalling stars",
    ", we might be able to well understand the nature of accretion and distortion of satellites .",
    "numerous authors subdivided halo stars into some ` components ' and examined the correlations between chemistry , age and kinematics of stars in each component .",
    "carollo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) obtained reliable eccentricities for @xmath182 halo stars within @xmath183 of the sun and decomposed them into the inner and outer halo components having distinct eccentricity distributions from each other . since their sample is _ local",
    "_ and is inherently biased in favour of stars that stay longer in the surveyed region , our formalism , which is designed to predict @xmath11 of the whole stellar halo , has to be modified for the purpose of fair comparison with their data . through proper incorporation of effects of such a bias , we can still predict @xmath11 for a _ local _ sample by fully taking into account a probability of finding each of halo stars in the surveyed region .",
    "this will be done in a separate paper in preparation . on the other hand",
    ", our formalism can directly apply to a _ global _ , and therefore less biased , sample of halo stars with reliable orbital eccentricities , such as those from next generation surveys including the gaia mission . in either case ,",
    "the analytical approach in the present paper certainly forms a basis that serves as a useful tool for analysing the kinematics of the stellar halo .",
    "large , unbiased database of halo stars would enable us to test whether a given component is in dynamical equilibrium by comparing the observed and predicted shape of @xmath11 .",
    "such comparison would hopefully discover some relaxed components , and their adiabatically conserved shape of @xmath11 would carry some useful information of the physics of violent relaxation .",
    "moreover , the spatial distribution of these relaxed components would enable us to see how far out in the halo the violent relaxation has exerted and how strongly it has affected the stellar halo . if the information of last violent relaxation , yet to be known observationally , is gained in this way , more precise assessment to the early evolution of the milky way would be possible , and our understanding of its formation would greatly be advanced .",
    "our current calculations of @xmath11 are certainly very simple and can be improved by using more realistic assumptions .",
    "for example , we can modify our analysis to allow axisymmetric potentials including a disk - like component as well as a bulge .",
    "preliminary analysis has confirmed that inclusion of a disk - like component would cause no significant change in the linear trend of @xmath11 described in section [ result ] , which will be discussed in a separate paper .",
