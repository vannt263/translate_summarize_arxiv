    "one of the main characteristics of this model is the fact that the lepton number l is not a good quantum number because both , the charged lepton and its antiparticle are in the same multiplet ; as a consequence , l does not commute with the electroweak extended gauge symmetry .",
    "the assignment of l starts with the sm assignments  @xcite    @xmath53    then , looking to the yukawa interactions of the sm particles and imposing l=0 in the covariant derivative implies @xmath54 for the scalars , l is assigned by inspection of the yukawa coupling constants and one finds @xmath55 notice that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are bi - leptoquarks and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are bi - lepton gauge bosons . finally , the physical gauge bosons related to the neutral currents of the model have l=0 .",

    "this model does not contain right handed neutrino fields .",
    "the gauge boson and scalar sectors for this model are exactly the same ones that for the model with right handed neutrinos  @xcite ; but the big differences are that now , the lepton number l is a good quantum number of the model and the gauge bosons does not carry lepton number at all , neither the exotic quarks .",
    "the scalars @xmath99 introduced have also l=0 , the lepton number can not be broken spontaneously and , as a consecuence , the neutrinos remain massless even with the inclussion of the radiative corrections .    in what follows and in order to simplify matters and make this model more predictable , we consider only the set of two scalar triplets @xmath100 and @xmath101 instead of the set of three triplets proposed in the original paper  @xcite , or the much more complex structure introduced in ref .",

    "but the point is that the lepton symmetry is now explicitly broken in the lagrangian by a term in the scalar potential of the form @xmath114 which violates lepton number by two units and turns on the zee radiative mechanism in the context of this 3 - 3 - 1 model with exotic electrons . as a matter of fact ,",

    "the model was introduced for the first time  @xcite and the quark and lepton content corresponds to the 3 - 3 - 1 model with right - handed neutrinos presented above ; but the scalar sector is modified , becoming minimal in the sense that only two scalar triplets ( with a modified vev structure ) are used in order to break the symmetry .",

    "the other two cp even scalars become the sm higgs boson and one extra higgs boson with a heavy mass of order @xmath138 respectively . * in the charged scalar sector @xmath139 there are four would be goldstone bosons , two of them are @xmath140 with l@xmath141 , eaten up by @xmath142 , and other two with l=0 eaten up by @xmath143 .",
    "* two charged scalars remains as physical states .",
    "counting degrees of freedom tells us that there are in @xmath100 and @xmath101 twelve ones namely : three cp even , three cp odd and six charged ones .",
    "eight of them are eaten up by the eight gauge bosons @xmath144 , and @xmath145 .",
    "four scalars remains as physical states , one of them being the sm higgs scalar .",

    "a variant of this model was considered in ref .",

    "@xcite and  @xcite , the one - loop diagrams are not able by themselves to provide a consistent mass spectrum for the quarks in the context of this economical model .",

    "this analysis lies outside the scope of this paper and it will be presented elsewhere .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us mention that the version of this economical 3 - 3 - 1 model developed in the context of the model with right handed neutrinos , can be extended to any one of the eight 3 family models presented in section ( [ sec : sec4 ] ) .",
    "the main motivation of our study was to investigate the neutrino mass spectrum in the framework of the local gauge structure @xmath0 .    summarizing : we have carried out an extensive analysis of the lepton number symmetry in the context of the best known versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
