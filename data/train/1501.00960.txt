    "he google books data set is captivating both for its availability and its incredible size .",
    "the first version of the data set , published in 2009 , incorporates over 5 million books  @xcite .",
    "these are , in turn , a subset selected for quality of optical character recognition and metadata  e.g .",
    ", dates of publication  from 15 million digitized books , largely provided by university libraries .",
    "these 5 million books contain over half a trillion words , 361 billion of which are in english . along with separate data sets for american english , british english , and english fiction",
    "; the first version also includes spanish , french , german , russian , chinese , and hebrew data sets .",
    "the second version , published in 2012  @xcite , contains 8 million books with half a trillion words in english alone , and also includes books in italian .",
    "the contents of the sampled books are split into case - sensitive @xmath0-grams which are typically blocks of text separated into @xmath0 = 1 ,  , 5 pieces by whitespace  e.g .",
    ", `` i '' is a 1-gram , and `` i  am '' is a 2-gram  -gram lengths range from one to five , contain some exceptions to this rule of thumb .",
    "for example , in the 2009 version , `` i  am . ''",
    "is tokenized as the 3-gram , `` i  am  . ''",
    "the period is counted in the corpus as a 1-gram , as are other punctuation marks .",
    "similarly , concatenations are often tokenized as 2-grams , so `` i ve  been '' becomes `` i  ve  been''also a 3-gram . ] .    a central if subtle and deceptive feature of the google books corpus , and for others composed in a similar fashion , is that the corpus is a reflection of a library in which only one of each book is available .",
    "ideally , we would be able to apply different popularity filters to the corpus .",
    "for example , we could ask to have @xmath0-gram frequencies adjusted according to book sales in the uk , library usage data in the us , or how often each page in each book is read on amazon s kindle service ( all over defined periods of time ) .",
    "evidently , incorporating popularity in any useful fashion would be an extremely difficult undertaking on the part of google .",
    "we are left with the fact that the google books library has ultimately been furnished by the efforts and choices of authors , editors , and publishing houses , who collectively aim to anticipate or dictate what people will read .",
    "this adds a further distancing from `` true culture '' as the ability to predict cultural success is often rendered fundamentally impossible due to social influence processes  @xcite  we have one seed for each tree but no view of the real forest that will emerge .    we therefore observe that the google books corpus encodes only a small - scale kind of popularity : how often @xmath0-grams appear in a library with all books given ( in principle ) equal importance and tied to their year of publication ( new editions and reprints allow some books to appear more than once ) .",
    "the corpus is thus more akin to a lexicon for a collection of texts , rather than the collection itself .",
    "but problematically , because google books @xmath0-grams do have frequency of usage associated with them based on this small - scale popularity , the data set readily conveys an illusion of large - scale cultural popularity .",
    "an @xmath0-gram which declines in usage frequency over time may in fact become more often read by a particular demographic focused on a specific genre of books . for example , `` frodo '' first appears in the second google books english fiction corpus in the mid 1950s and declines thereafter in popularity with a few resurgent spikes  @xcite .",
    "while this limitation to small - scale popularity tempers the kinds of conclusions we can draw , the evolution of @xmath0-grams within the google books corpus  their relative abundance , their growth and decay  still gives us a valuable lens into how language use and culture has changed over time .",
    "our contribution here will be to show :    1 .   a principled approach for exploring word and phrase evolution ; 2 .   how the google books corpus is challenged in other , orthogonal respects , particularly by the inclusion of scientific and medical journals ; and 3 .",
    "how future analyses of the google books corpus should be considered .    for ease of comparison with related work",
    ", we focus primarily on 1-grams from selected english data sets between the years 1800 and 2000 . in this work",
    ", we will use the terms `` word '' and `` 1-gram '' interchangeably for the sake of convenience .",
    "the total volume of ( non - unique ) english 1-grams grows exponentially between these years , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : volume ] , except during major conflicts  e.g . , the american civil war and both world wars  when the total volume dips substantially .",
    "we also observe a slight increase in volume between the first and second version of the unfiltered english data set .",
    "between the two english fiction data sets , however , the total volume actually decreases considerably , which indicates insufficient filtering was used in producing the first version , and immediately suggests the initial english fiction data set may not be appropriate for any kind of analysis .",
    "the simplest possible analysis involving any google books data set is to track the relative frequencies of a specific set of words or phrases .",
    "examples of such analyses involve words or phrases surrounding individuality  @xcite , gender  @xcite , urbanization  @xcite , and time  @xcite , all of which are of profound interest",
    ". however , the strength of all conclusions drawn from these must take into account both the number of words and phrases in question ( anywhere from two  @xcite to twenty  @xcite or more at a time ) and the sampling methods used to build the google books corpus .",
    "many researchers have carried out broad analyses of the google books corpus , examining properties and dynamics of entire languages .",
    "these include analyses of zipf s and heaps laws as applied to the corpus  @xcite , the rates of verb regularization  @xcite , rates of word introduction and obsolescence and durations of cultural memory  @xcite , as well as an observed decrease in the need for new words in several languages  @xcite .",
    "however , these studies also appear to take for granted that the data sets sample in a consistent manner from works spanning the last two centuries .",
    "analysis of the emotional content of books suggests a lag of roughly a decade between exogenous events and their effects in literature  @xcite , complicating the use of the google books data sets directly as snapshots of cultural identity .",
    "as we will demonstrate , an assumption of unbiased sampling of books is not reasonable during the last century and especially during recent decades , which is of particular importance to all analyses concerned with recent social change . since parsing in the data sets is case - sensitive , we can give a suggestive illustration of this observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffig ] , which displays the relative ( normalized ) frequencies of `` figure '' versus `` figure '' in both versions of the corpus and for both english and english fiction . in both versions of the english data set , the capitalized version , `` figure",
    ", '' surpasses its lowercase counterpart during the 1960s . since the majority of books in the corpus originated in university libraries  @xcite , a major effect of scientific texts on the dynamics of the data set is quite plausible",
    "this trend is also apparent  albeit delayed  in the first version of the english fiction data set , which again suggests insufficient filtering during the compilation process for that version .",
    "because of google books library - like nature , authors are not represented equally or by any measure of popularity in any given data set but are instead roughly by their own prolificacy .",
    "this leaves room for individual authors to have noteworthy effects on the dynamics of the data sets , as we will demonstrate in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "lastly , due to copyright laws , the public data sets do not include metadata ( see supporting online material  @xcite ) , and the data are truncated to avoid inference of authorship , which severely limits any analysis of censorship  @xcite in the corpus . under these conditions",
    ", we will show that much caution must be used when employing these data sets  with a possible exception of the second version of english fiction  to draw cultural conclusions from the frequencies of words or phrases in the corpus .",
    "we structure the remainder of the paper as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : methods ] , we describe how to use jensen - shannon divergence to highlight the dynamics over time of both versions of the english and english fiction data sets , paying particular attention to key contributing words . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we display and discuss examples of these highlights , exploring the extent of the scientific literature bias and issues with individual authors ; we also provide a detailed inspection of some example decade  decade comparisons .",
    "we offer concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we examine the dynamics of the google books corpus by calculating the statistical divergence between the distributions of 1-grams in two given years . a commonly used measure of statistical divergence",
    "is kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence  @xcite , based on which we use a bounded , symmetric measure . given a language with @xmath1 unique words and 1-gram distributions @xmath2 in the first year and @xmath3 in second",
    ", the kl divergence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the probability of observing the @xmath6 1-gram random chosen from the 1-gram distribution for first year , and @xmath7 is the probability of observing the same word in the second year .",
    "the units of kl divergence is bits , and may be interpreted as the average number of bits wasted if a text from the first year is encoded efficiently , but according to the distribution from the latter , incorrect year . to demonstrate this",
    ", we may rewrite the previous equation as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the shannon entropy  @xcite , also the average number of bits required per word in an efficient encoding for the original distribution ; and the remaining term is the average number of bits required per word in an efficient , but mistaken , encoding of a given text .",
    "however , if a single ( say , the @xmath10 ) 1-gram in the language exists in the first year , but not in the second , then @xmath11 , and the divergence diverges .",
    "since this scenario is not extraordinary for the data sets in question , we instead use jensen - shannon divergence ( jsd )  @xcite given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a mixed distribution of the two years .",
    "this measure of divergence is bounded between 0 when the distributions are the same and 1 bit in the extreme case when there is no overlap between the 1-grams in the two distributions .",
    "if we begin with a uniform distribution of @xmath1 species and replace @xmath14 of those species with @xmath14 entirely new ones , the jsd between the original and new distribution is @xmath15 , the proportion of species replaced .",
    "the jsd is also symmetric , which is an added convenience .",
    "the jsd may be expressed as @xmath16 from which it is apparent that a similar waste analogy holds as with kl divergence , with the mixed distribution taking the place of the approximation regardless of the year a text was written .",
    "the form for jensen - shannon divergence given in eq .",
    "[ eq : jsd ] can be broken down into contributions from individual words , where the contribution from the @xmath6 word to the divergence between two years is given by @xmath17 some rearrangement gives @xmath18 where @xmath19 , so that contribution from an individual word is proportional to the average probability of the word , and the proportion depends on the ratio between the smaller probability ( without loss of generality ) and the average .",
    "namely , we may reframe the equation above as @xmath20 words with larger average probability yield greater contributions as do those with smaller ratios , @xmath21 , between the smaller and average probability .",
    "so while a common 1-gram  such as `` the , '' `` if , '' or a period  changing subtly can have a large effect on the divergence , so can an uncommon ( or entirely new ) word given a sufficient shift from one year to the next .",

    "the maximum possible contribution ( in bits ) is precisely the average probability of the word in question , which occurs if and only if the smaller probability is 0 .",

    "based on our introductory remarks and ensuing detailed analysis , it should now be clear that the contents of the google books corpus do not represent an unbiased sampling of publications . beyond being library - like , the evolution of the corpus throughout the 1900s is increasingly dominated by scientific publications rather than popular works .",
    "we have shown that even the first data set specifically labeled as fiction appears to be saturated with medical literature .",
    "when examining these data sets in the future , it will therefore be necessary to first identify and distinguish the popular and scientific components in order to form a picture of the corpus that is informative about cultural and linguistic evolution .",
    "for instance , one should ask how much of any observed gender shift in language reflects word choice in popular works and how much is due to changes in scientific norms , as well as which might precede the other if they are somewhat in balance .",
    "even if we are able to restrict our focus to popular works by appropriately filtering scientific terms , the library - like nature of the google books corpus will mean the resultant normalized frequencies of words can not be a direct measure of the `` true '' cultural popularity of those words as they are read ( again , frodo ) .",
    "secondarily , not only will there be a delay between changes in the public popularity of words and their appearance in print , normalized frequencies will also be affected by the prolificacy of the authors . in the case of upton sinclair",
    "s lanny budd , a fictional character was vaulted to the upper echelons of words affecting divergence ( even surpassing hitler ) by virtue of appearing as the protagonist in 11 novels between 1940 and 1953 .",
    "google books is at best a limited proxy for social information after the fact .",
    "the google books corpus s beguiling power to immediately quantify a vast range of linguistic trends warrants a very cautious approach to any effort to extract scientifically meaningful results .",

    "<S> it is tempting to treat frequency trends from the google books data sets as indicators of the `` true '' popularity of various words and phrases . </S>",
    "<S> doing so allows us to draw quantitatively strong conclusions about the evolution of cultural perception of a given topic , such as time or gender . </S>",
    "<S> however , the google books corpus suffers from a number of limitations which make it an obscure mask of cultural popularity . </S>",
    "<S> a primary issue is that the corpus is in effect a library , containing one of each book . </S>",
    "<S> a single , prolific author is thereby able to noticeably insert new phrases into the google books lexicon , whether the author is widely read or not . with this understood </S>",
    "<S> , the google books corpus remains an important data set to be considered more lexicon - like than text - like . </S>",
    "<S> here , we show that a distinct problematic feature arises from the inclusion of scientific texts , which have become an increasingly substantive portion of the corpus throughout the 1900s . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a surge of phrases typical to academic articles but less common in general , such as references to time in the form of citations . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight these dynamics by examining and comparing major contributions to the statistical divergence of english data sets between decades in the period 18002000 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that only the english fiction data set from the second version of the corpus is not heavily affected by professional texts , in clear contrast to the first version of the fiction data set and both unfiltered english data sets . </S>",
    "<S> our findings emphasize the need to fully characterize the dynamics of the google books corpus before using these data sets to draw broad conclusions about cultural and linguistic evolution . </S>"
