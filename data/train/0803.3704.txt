    "on long time scales  evolutionary time  the particular characteristics of species evolve widely from birth to extinction , while throughout ecological time most species persist sometimes for decades or even centuries @xcite .",
    "their organization in complex networks of local communities and extended metacommunities is subject to abundant variations in terms of relative distributions .",
    "usually , species maintain themselves with constant abundance but , from time - to - time , processes such as invasion or succession produce fast regrouping throughout a particular site or region @xcite .",
    "macroecology @xcite studies the relationships between organisms and their environment at large spatial scales in order to characterize and explain universal statistical patterns of abundance , distribution and diversity @xcite .",
    "a variety of models and methods from statistical physics are appropriate for the study of ecosystem dynamics , in which the main `` entities '' are either many individual organisms within populations , or many species within local , regional or continental communities @xcite .",
    "the remarkable regularities in patterns of data on how species originates , persist , assemble in groups , and eventually go extinct , suggest the existence of general mechanisms from which the biodiversity and the structure of ecological communities originate @xcite .",
    "the difficulties in explaining the biological diversity of such systems originate from the very different spatial and temporal scales , starting with the evolution and biogeographic distribution of species and ending with individual births and deaths in local communities .",
    "present approaches for describing the dynamics of population genetics and ecology consider either the importance of the genetic fitness or the influence of random events governing birth , death and migration phenomena @xcite .",
    "there are thus two main , but conflicting perspectives on the nature of ecological communities : the niche - assembly and the dispersal - assembly perspective @xcite . in the present work",
    "we intend to use this second approach , constructing a simple spatially explicit stochastic model for describing the relative species abundance and the spatial diversity patterns of trees in a tropical forest @xcite .",
    "nowadays scientist argue that ecological systems of similar species that compete with each - other only for the limited amount of natural resources can be successfully approached by means of neutral models .",
    "one of the first and most widely used neutral models is that of stephen hubbell @xcite , who assumed in his theory that within groups of ecologically similar species , individuals fill the landscapes up to a point of saturation and the dynamics of all these species is governed by the same birth- , death- , migration- and mutation - rates .",
    "this simple neutrality principle allows us to study a wide variety of systems by means of stochastic computer simulations and to use the methods of statistical mechanics to get analytical results @xcite .",
    "tropical forests @xcite contain a wider variety of tree species compared to northern coniferous forests ( 2 orders of magnitude larger ) , and it is believed that such systems are much closer to the neutrality assumption .",
    "since the number of mature individual trees in equal - area samples of each forest type is almost the same , the increase in the abundance of a particular species needs to be compensated by a decrease in another species s population .    in order to develop an appropriate model",
    ", one needs to take into account the whole set of factors influencing community composition : births , deaths , immigration and ( on longer time scales ) speciation .",
    "these processes interact in a complex manner and produce the commonly observed empirical patterns of diversity and distribution of abundances .",
    "the model should prescribe , for each generation , a method for choosing the species identity of the individuals that die and those that will occupy ( by birth or immigration ) the vacancies created . a simple method which describes fairly well the above mentioned processes",
    "is the one developed by hubbell and it is called `` zero - sum ecological drift '' @xcite .",
    "this method implies that the replacing species are drawn at random from the existing community of species .",
    "the `` ecological drift '' is connected to the random replacement process and assumes that all individuals , regardless of species , have equal probabilities of giving birth , dying , immigrating or acquiring a mutation to generate a speciation event .",
    "the ecological drift does not imply an equal chance for each species to fill a given vacancy .",
    "obviously , the greater probability of being drawn into a vacancy belongs to more abundant species .",
    "a remarkable observation is that individuals are equal , but species , as collective entities , are not . in hubbell s model",
    "@xcite the ecological drift , with no additional mechanism is enough to produce the patterns of species abundance and diversity observed in nature . in particular , the community of tropical trees is very well described by these neutral models and neutrality will be also the basis of the approach considered in this work .",
    "contrary to earlier modeling efforts @xcite , here we will continue the novel idea introduced by zillio  et  al .",
    "@xcite , and a spatially explicit model resembling the classical voter model will be studied . in our approach",
    "we will consider , however , a more complex , two - parameter version , which is not suitable for an analytical study .",
    "we will argue why it is important to make the model considered in @xcite more complex , and we will determine the best parameters for optimally reproducing the measured macroecological patterns .",
    "in order to describe the statistics of species sizes in meta- or local ecological communities , the main measure which is usually considered is the relative species abundances ( rsa ) and the rank - abundance distribution .",
    "provided our data is spatially accurate , and we know the location of each individual , we can also investigate the species - area scaling and the auto - correlation function for the individuals of a given species .",
    "we will discuss briefly these measures here .",
    "the relative species abundance distribution is introduced for characterizing the frequency of species with a given abundance @xcite .",
    "three different types of plots are generally used ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bci_rsa ] ) for representing species - abundance distribution .",
    "historically the first , and thus also the most widespread , representation of species abundances is due to preston @xcite , who considered exponentially increasing abundance intervals ( i.e.  @xmath0 , @xmath1 with fixed @xmath2 ) , and plotted the number of species found within these intervals as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "preston s plot is motivated by the fact that abundances can vary in wide limits and there are relatively small numbers of abundant species . by considering fixed length abundance intervals",
    "one would get large statistical fluctuations on the tail of the curve . for widely different communities ,",
    "the preston plot has a gaussian - like shape . as an example for such a representation , on fig .",
    "[ fig : bci_rsa]a we illustrate the shape of rsa for the barro colorado tropical forest tree census . in this case",
    "however , the curve does not show a clear gaussian shape .    a second way of representing the species abundance distribution is arranging the species in decreasing order by their abundances and plotting the species s rank versus its abundance ( rank - abundance plot ) on a log - log scale @xcite .",
    "this type of representation is inspired by several abundance studies in sociology and economics , leading to the very general pareto - zipf distribution .",
    "for the barro colorado tropical tree census the rank - abundance plot is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : bci_rsa]b .    the third and mathematically most rigorous way of representing the species - abundance distribution is plotting the mathematical distribution function @xmath4 , i.e.  the probability density for finding a species with a given @xmath5 abundance . for most of the neutral - like communities",
    "this distribution function has a tilted j shape on a log - log scale . as an example , on fig .",
    "[ fig : bci_rsa]c we plot this probability density for the barro colorado tropical tree census .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath4 can be derived from the preston plot by dividing the number of individuals in each interval with the length of the interval , and plotting on log - log scale this quantity versus the mean abundance in the given interval .",
    "it is also easy to realize that the rank - abundance plot is related to the cumulative distribution function corresponding to the @xmath4 .    ) . ]      generally , the number of detected species does not scale linearly by increasing the size of the sampled territory . in order to characterize this dependence ,",
    "the species - area relationship is studied .",
    "this is done by considering larger and larger territories , and counting the number of species present within these areas @xcite . for a better statistic ,",
    "sometimes an average species number is calculated on several territories with similar areas .",
    "the dependence of the average species number on the size of the sampling area is usually a power - law , with exponent in the range 0.150.5 . as usual ,",
    "the presence of the scaling is visually illustrated by using a log - log scale like in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bci_sar ] ) .          in case",
    "the individuals are restricted to a given spatial position , like trees for example , one can characterize the spatial distribution of the individuals from a given species using an auto - correlation function .",
    "this function is defined as the usual auto - correlation function in statistical physics , and characterizes the probability density that for a given individual an individual from the same species exists at a distance @xmath6 .",
    "the way we construct the @xmath7 auto - correlation function is the following .",
    "first a check - board type uniform mesh is considered , and the territory is divided into small , square - like domains ( labeled by coordinates @xmath8 ) and the number of individuals from the considered species is determined in each domain @xmath9 . the auto - correlation function for a relative coordinate @xmath10 ( @xmath11 )",
    "is calculated as    @xmath12    here @xmath13 denotes the average number of individuals from the considered species in the constructed domains : @xmath14 . since there is no reason to assume that the distribution of the individuals is non - isotropic , we can calculate the average of the @xmath11 values for all @xmath10 values that are inside a ring with radius @xmath6 and width @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , considering a reasonable small @xmath15 value .",

    "the experimental results used for comparison are from a detailed 50 hectares tropical forest tree census in barro colorado island ( bci ) , realized by the smithsonian tropical research institute , center for tropical forest science ( ctfs ) @xcite .",
    "bci is located in the atlantic watershed of the gatun lake ( panama ) and was declared a biological reserve in 1923 .",
    "it has been administrated by the smithsonian tropical research institute since 1946 . from the viewpoint of ecological studies ,",
    "this island is ideal , because it is covered with a rain forest that is still unperturbed by human beings .",
    "the flora and fauna of barro colorado island have been studied extensively and inventories have reported 1369 plant species , 93 mammal species ( including bats ) , 366 avian species ( including migratory ) , and 90 species of amphibians and reptiles .",
    "the tropical tree census was performed only on a small part of this huge island , precisely on a @xmath18 meters ( 50 hectares ) area .",
    "the first census was completed in 1982 , revealing a total of approximately 240,000 stems of 303 species of trees and shrubs more than 1 cm in diameter at breast height .",
    "this ctfs program has an important advantage , because in each census , all free - standing woody stems at least 10 mm diameter at breast height are identified , tagged , and mapped , and hence accurate statistics can be made .",
    "data is publicly available for several years : 1982 , 1985 , 1990 and 1995 @xcite .        from the bci data",
    "file it results that the studied area embodies 316 tree species , containing in total more than 320,000 individuals @xcite .",
    "the density of individuals for the 1995 census is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : bci_dens ] with a gray - scale code ( darker region corresponds to higher density ) . in the western part of the studied area lies a relatively large swampland ( lighter region in the left side of fig .",

    "this area is ecologically quite different from the other parts ( see for example the spatial distribution of the most abundance species : _ hybanthus prunifolius _",
    "[ fig : hybanthus_dens ] ) . therefore in determining the relevant macroecological measures only trees located in the eastern square - like part of this region ( @xmath19 meters ) were considered .        the relative species abundance distribution for the census from 1990 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bci_rsa ] . the rank - abundance plot and",
    "the probability density curves suggest a scaling with an obvious cutoff .",
    "the scaling exponent is close to @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "data for the other census years gives very similar results .",
    "for the bci dataset the species - area scaling is not obvious at all , since the considered territory is quite small . as it is visible on fig .",
    "[ fig : bci_sar ] the power - law trend appears only in the limit of larger areas .",

    "[ fig : bci_sar ] already suggests , similar results can be obtained for all census years , the stable scaling exponents varying between : 0.148 and 0.162 .",
    "the obtained exponents are in agreement with species - area scaling results known in other macroecological systems @xcite .     for year 1995 . ]    the @xmath7 auto - correlation function , characterizing the spatial distribution of the 10 most abundant species was also calculated . for all of them , a power - law type decrease has been observed . as an example , on fig .",

    "both picture suggest a power - law like decrease for @xmath7 .",
    "there are numerous theoretical modeling efforts for understanding the relevant macroecological measures like the rsa distribution @xcite .",
    "most of these models are however mean - field like approaches in the sense that the spatiality of the individuals is lost , and the only relevant quantity that characterizes the system is the number of individuals in each species .",
    "these models are usually successful for reproducing the right rsa curves .",
    "our goal here is to follow the idea proposed by zillio et al .",
