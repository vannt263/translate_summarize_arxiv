    "observations with the @xmath4 observatory and some earlier missions established that large quantities of gas are cooling below x  ray emitting temperatures in the cores of many clusters ( see fabian et al .  [ 1984 , 1991 ] , and fabian [ 1994 ] for reviews ) . typical cooling rates are @xmath5 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the gas cools over a region whose typical radius is @xmath6 kpc .",
    "the cooling is due to the x - rays we observe .",
    "the emission of x - rays is thermally significant but not very dynamically significant ; the observations imply that the time scale for cooling @xmath7 satisfies @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dynamical time scale , and @xmath10 is the age of the cluster ( or , at least , the time since the last major subcluster merger ) .",
    "this means that the inflow associated with the cooling is rather slow (   [ sec : inflow ] ) .",
    "the x - ray evidence for the cooling gas comes from both the x - ray images and x - ray spectra of cluster cores .",
    "x - ray images of the central regions of clusters with cooling flows show very strongly peaked surface brightnesses . when one determines the electron densities and the cooling times implied by these brightnesses , they reach values of @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 yr .",
    "in essentially every known case , there is a very bright elliptical galaxy at the center of the cooling region .",
    "x - ray spectra also indicate the presence of cooling gas .",
    "lower resolution spectra with rosat and asca show a radially increasing temperature gradient in the central regions of cooling flow clusters . in non - cooling flow clusters ,",
    "the central regions are nearly isothermal . in many cases ,",
    "the x - ray spectra of the central regions of cooling flow clusters are not well - fit by any single temperature component , indicating that a range of gas temperatures are present .",
    "the most direct evidence of cooling comes from higher resolution x - ray spectra which show low ionization x - ray lines .",
    "as the gas in the center of the cluster cools and recombines , low ionization x - ray lines are produced .",
    "for example , the @xmath4 focal plane crystal spectrometer ( fpcs ) detected o  viii and fe  xvii lines from the cooling cores of the virgo and perseus cluster ( canizares et al .",
    "1988 ) . as i will discuss below (   [ sec : low_ion ] ) , such lines provide the most direct x - ray evidence that gas is cooling out of the x - ray temperature band .    in this paper , i will discuss a few potential applications of high resolution x - ray spectra to cluster cooling flows to illustrate what might be done with the high throughput x - ray spectroscopy mission ( htxs ) .",
    "i will leave the discussion of the global properties of x - ray cluster spectra and abundances in the able hands of joel bregman . also , i wo nt review the standard plasma diagnostics from x - ray spectra , since they will also be reviewed by others .",
    "the greatest mystery about cooling flows is the nature of the ultimate repository of the gas seen to cool through the x - ray band .",
    "if cooling flows are long  lived phenomena , the total amount of cooled gas is roughly @xmath14 although cooler material is seen in the optical and radio as emission line gas , young stars , or cold gas , the amount seen in other spectral bands is considerably less than the total mass of cooled gas which is expected .",
    "thus , it is most important to confirm that the gas seen cooling through the x - ray band does indeed cool to lower temperatures .",
    "theoretically , if thermal conduction is suppressed , radiative cooling accelerates .",
    "once gas has cooled to a few million k , it is very difficult to prevent it from cooling further .",
    "however , it may be possible that some other mechanism intervenes to reheat the gas back up to the ambient cluster temperature of @xmath0@xmath15 k. for example , norman & meiksin ( 1996 ) have recently suggested that reconnecting magnetic fields and thermal conduction might reheat the cooling x - ray gas .",
    "measurements of the fluxes of individual low ionization x - ray lines can allow one to determine directly the cooling rates of gas at low temperatures . for lines such as fe",
    "xvii produced mainly at temperatures which are much lower than the ambient cluster temperature , the gas can be assumed to be cooling in steady - state , and the line luminosity is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mean mass per particle in terms of the proton mass @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the temperature from which the gas starts to cool , @xmath20 is its current temperature , the emissivity of the line is @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the density of the gas , and the total emissivity ( cooling rate ) of the gas is @xmath21 ( e.g. , white & sarazin 1987 ) . typically , the emissivity of a low ionization line peaks at a temperature @xmath23 . as long as @xmath24 , the line luminosity is nearly independent of most of the details of how the gas cools , and depends mainly on the cooling rate through that temperature , @xmath25 . for example , the initial temperature of the gas , @xmath19 is not important . the specific density at which the gas cools is also not important ;",
    "if the density of the gas is increased , both the rate of line emission and the cooling rate are increased by the same factor , and the amount of line emission per gram of cooling gas remains unchanged .",
    "similarly , the line luminosity is nearly independent of the overall abundance of heavy elements .",
    "this result occurs because the total cooling rate is dominated by line emission by heavy elements at low temperatures , so changing the heavy element abundance affects @xmath26 and @xmath27 by almost the same factor .",
    "the specific numerical factor in front of equation  ( [ eq : linelum ] ) assumes that the gas cools isobarically , which is essentially what is expected , but the luminosity would only be reduced by @xmath2840% is the gas cooled more nearly isochorically .",
    "line fluxes from a number of individual low ionization x - ray lines can therefore be used to determine the amount of cooling through a variety of temperatures given by the values of @xmath23 for the lines .",
    "if the gas is indeed cooling to low temperatures below the x - ray band , then the implied cooling rates should all agree [ @xmath29 constant ] .",
    "if the gas only cools part way through the x - ray band and then is reheated , the implied values of @xmath30 for the lowest ionization lines should be much lower than those derived from higher ionization lines , or from other analyses of the x - ray spectrum or surface brightness .    at present , the only data with sufficient spectral resolution to apply this technique is still the @xmath4 fpcs data , and the observations of the virgo and perseus clusters are consistent with gas cooling out of the x - ray band ( canizares et al .",
    "however , more observations of high resolution line spectra are needed .      beyond this determination of the amount of gas cooling out of the x - ray band",
    ", the fluxes of x - ray lines can be used to constrain the local density and temperature structure in the cooling flow gas .",
    "the simplest situation would be if the gas were locally homogeneous , so that there was a single value of the gas density @xmath31 and temperature @xmath32 at each radius @xmath33 .",
    "in homogeneous models , the gas does nt cool to low temperature until it flow into the center ( @xmath34 kpc ) of the cluster ( e.g. , white & sarazin 1987 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the standard picture for cluster cooling flows is that the gas is highly inhomogeneous , with a wide range of temperatures and densities at each radius .",
    "the different phases of gas are likely to be nearly isobaric , because equation  ( [ eq : times ] ) guarantees that the sound crossing time for a clump of gas will be much less than its cooling time .",
    "thus , there are likely to be dense lumps of cool gas immersed in more diffuse , hotter gas .",
    "now , gas which is either denser or cooler radiates more effectively than gas which is hotter and less dense , so cooling amplifies the temperature differences in the gas . as a result ,",
    "the cooler , denser lumps of gas will cool out of the x - ray band at large radii , while the more diffuse , hotter gas will not cool until it has reached the center of the flow . in an inhomogeneous cooling flow",
    ", gas cools out of the x - ray band over a very extended region of the order of 200 kpc in radius ( thomas et al .",
    "1987 ; white & sarazin 1987 ) .",
    "analyses of the x - ray images of cluster cooling flows from the @xmath4 observatory and subsequently have indicated that the gas must be quite inhomogeneous ( thomas et al .",
    "1987 ; white & sarazin 1987 ) .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness profiles of cluster are strongly peaked to the center , but not as strongly as expected if the gas were homogeneous .",
    "most of the gas must cool below x - ray emitting temperatures at relatively large radii @xmath0100 kpc .",
    "deconvolutions of the x - ray surface brightness profiles suggest that the amount of gas cooling out of the x - ray band varies with radius roughly as @xmath35 ( thomas et al .",
    "1987 ; fabian et al .  1991 ) .",
    "nulsen ( 1986 ) and thomas ( 1988 ) have developed the theory for the density and temperature fluctuations in cluster cooling flows , and some resulting x - ray spectra have been calculated by wise & sarazin ( 1993 ) .",
    "let @xmath36 be the temperature distribution function of gas , defined such that @xmath37 is the fraction of the total volume @xmath38 occupied by gas with a temperature between @xmath20 and @xmath39 .",
    "let us assume for the moment that the gas is isobaric , and let @xmath40 be the pressure of the gas .",
    "then , the luminosity of any x - ray line is given by @xmath41 for steady - state cooling , at low temperatures @xmath42 the temperature distribution function approaches @xmath43 \\ , .\\ ] ] substituting equation  ( [ eq : f_steady ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : lum_fluct ] ) recovers equation  ( [ eq : linelum ] ) .",
    "as noted in   [ sec : low_ion ] , different x - ray lines vary with temperature in different ways , and the emissivities of many lines ( e.g. , the fe l lines ) peak at some temperature @xmath23 . thus , by comparing the fluxes in a variety of lines , one can determine or constrain the distribution of density and temperature in the gas . the spectrally derived distribution function can be compared to that required to explain the x - ray surface brightness profiles .",
    "also , the distribution functions of densities and temperatures at the outer edge of a cooling flow can be used to derive the degree of density fluctuations in the general intracluster gas . among other things ,",
    "this is needed to correct distances derived by the comparison of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect and the x - ray ray emission of clusters for the effects of density fluctuations .",
    "of course , one of the main applications for high resolution x - ray spectroscopy will be to use the doppler effect to measure velocities in the hot gas . in the case of cooling flows , it would be very exciting if one could detect the radial inflow associated with the cooling and accretion of the x - ray emitting gas by the central galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , the inflow in cooling flows is generally very slow and subsonic (   [ sec : intro ] ) , and this will not be easy to do",
    ".    one can derive an approximate expression for the inflow velocity @xmath44 in a cooling flow by noting that mass conservation requires that the cooling rate @xmath45 interior to @xmath33 must equal the inflow rate @xmath46 in steady - state .",
    "the density can be estimated by assuming that the velocity is also given approximately by @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to the following approximate expression for the inflow velocity , which is found to agree reasonably well with detailed hydrodynamical models : @xmath48^{1/2 } \\ , \\left [ \\frac{t(r)}{10 ^ 8 \\ , { \\rm k } } \\right]^{-1/2 } \\ , { \\rm km } \\ , { \\rm s}^{-1 } \\ , .\\ ] ]    the variation of the inflow velocity with radius is illustrated in figure  [ fig : inflow ] .",
    "the solid curves show the inflow velocities for detailed hydrodynamical models from wise & sarazin ( 1993 ) , while the dashed curves are the result of using the approximate expression in equation  ( [ eq : vradial ] ) . for both of the models shown in figure  [ fig : inflow ] ,",
    "the total cooling rate is 300 @xmath49 yr@xmath3 , and the ambient cluster gas temperature is @xmath50 k. the inflow velocities are always low ( @xmath010 km s@xmath3 ) at the outer edge of the flow .",
    "the upper curves in figure  [ fig : inflow ] are for a homogeneous model in which the gas has a single density and temperature at each radius .",
    "in such a homogeneous model , the gas remains hot until it reaches the innermost part of the flow ( @xmath34 kpc ) , where it cools very rapidly . because all of the gas which enters the cooling flow continues to flow into the center",
    ", @xmath45 is constant , and the inflow velocity grows to a large value @xmath51 km s@xmath3 at the center .    in the inhomogeneous model , gas cools below x - ray emitting temperatures throughout the center of the cluster . in the specific inhomogeneous model shown figure  [ fig : inflow ] , @xmath52 , which agrees with the analyses of the surface brightness profiles of many clusters ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "1991 ) . since the mass flux of inflowing gas declines towards the center , the inflow velocity does not increase as rapidly as in the homogeneous case .",
    "in fact , for @xmath52 , the effect of the radius term and @xmath53 term in equation  ( [ eq : vradial ] ) cancel one another , and the only reason the velocity increases in the center is that the temperature drops there , which speeds up the cooling . as discussed in   [ sec : inhomo ] , the analysis of existing x - ray data strongly favor inhomogeneous models . in such models ,",
    "the inflow velocities are generally small ( @xmath2 km s@xmath3 ) , which will make it quite difficult to detect the inflow with x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "the effect of inflow velocities on line profiles is illustrated in figures  [ fig : profile_tot ] and [ fig : profile_cnt ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : profile_tot ] shows integrated line profiles for the fe  xvii line from the entire cooling flow region of a cluster for homogeneous and inhomogeneous models .",
    "the models are the same as those in figure  [ fig : inflow ] .",
    "the solid curves assume only thermal line broadening , while the dashed curves show the opposite extreme of transonic turbulent broadening (   [ sec : turbulent ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : profile_cnt ] shows the same line profiles , but for the center of the cooling flow ( in projection ) . in practice",
    ", these spectra would require a spatial resolution of roughly 1 kpc , which translates into @xmath541 arcsec for typical cluster cooling flow .",
    "thus , htxs will have too little spatial resolution to see spectra comparable to figure  [ fig : profile_cnt ] in all clusters except possibly virgo , and figure  [ fig : profile_tot ] is more relevant to htxs .    for a homogeneous cooling flow ,",
    "the high velocities near the center ( coupled with the strong low ionization line emission from this region ) produce strong distortions in the shapes of low ionization x - ray emission lines .",
    "these lines have a very non - gaussian square shape in the integrated spectrum ( figure  [ fig : profile_tot ] ) , and are double in the central spectrum ( figure  [ fig : profile_cnt ] ) .",
    "turbulent broadening reduces these effects , but does nt eliminate them .",
    "however , in the more realistic inhomogeneous models , the inflow velocities are small and the line emission is distributed over the entire cooling flow region .",
    "line profiles for strongly inhomogeneous models do not show any strong effects of inflow , and are , in practice , indistinguishable from gaussians .    in conclusion",
    ", it will be difficult to measure inflow velocities in cluster cooling flows with x - ray spectra if they are as inhomogeneous ( and turbulent ) as is generally thought .",
    "most astrophysical gases are turbulent , and one seldom encounters line profiles from heavy elements which are dominated by thermal broadening .",
    "it is likely that the intracluster gas in cooling flows is strongly turbulent .",
    "we already have indirect evidence for this from the profiles of the optical emission line nebulae which are observed almost universally in the central @xmath020 kpc of cluster cooling flows ( e.g. , baum 1992 ) .",
    "the optical emission lines are quite broad , and imply turbulent velocities of 200  1000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "it is likely that the emission line gas is embedded in the x - ray emitting gas , and that the x - ray gas has similar velocities .",
    "the upper limit on the turbulent velocity of the hot gas is presumably the sound speed , since supersonic turbulent motions would damp quickly .",
    "this is consistent with the largest values of the turbulent velocities from the emission lines .",
    "thus , it is likely that x - ray emission lines from cooling flows will be broadened by turbulent velocities of @xmath55    in figures  [ fig : profile_tot ] and  [ fig : profile_cnt ] , the broad line profiles ( dashed curves ) show the effects of maximal , transonic turbulence on the profiles of x - ray lines .",
    "it seems likely that turbulence will dominate over thermal broadening and radial inflow in determining the profiles of x - ray lines from cooling flows , at least if cooling flows are strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "of course , the term `` turbulence '' often refers to complex unresolved motions of any origin , rather than real hydrodynamical turbulence .",
    "there is some evidence for interesting structure due to radial velocity stratification or occasionally rotation in the kinematic of the optical emission line nebulae of some cooling flows ( e.g. , baum 1992 ) .",
    "these motions may arise from interesting physical processes , and may lead to more interesting line profiles or spatial variations than homogeneous , isotropic turbulence .",
    "i consider two illustrative examples : the expansion of radio lobes , and disks due to rotating gas .      in nearly every large cluster cooling flow ,",
    "the central galaxy hosts a moderately strong radio source .",
    "conversely , many of the most famous radio sources in the nearby universe lie at the centers of cooling flows ( virgo a , perseus a , cygnus a , hydra a ,  ) .",
    "these are generally fairly compact , fr  i radio sources .",
    "x - ray observations with rosat have provided evidence for the interaction of the lobes of these radio sources with the ambient x - ray emitting gas in cluster cooling flows ( sarazin 1996 ) .",
    "first , the nonthermal pressures of the radio lobes inferred from synchrotron theory are generally comparable to or slightly greater than the thermal pressures of the x - ray emitting gas at the same projected radii .",
    "second , the radio images and x - ray images are anticorrelated , in the sense that the radio lobes are faint in x - rays .",
    "the best example of this is the perseus cluster ( bhringer et al .",
    "1993 ) , but a number of other cases have been found ( huang & sarazin 1996 ; sarazin 1996 ) . in perseus , it appears that the x - ray emission is concentrated just outside the edges of the radio lobes .",
    "third , the radio lobes in cooling flows are generally polarized but have extremely large faraday rotations ( taylor et al .",
    "this implies that there is very little thermal plasma within the radio lobes themselves .",
    "all of this is consistent with the idea that the radio plasma has expanded against and displaced the x - ray emitting gas .    in some cases",
    ", one also finds that the optical emission line gas is concentrated around the edges of the radio lobes ( baum 1992 ) . in a number of cases ,",
    "mcnamara & oconnell ( 1993 ) found regions of blue optical continuum emission at the edges of radio lobes in cooling flows . in a1795 ,",
    "hst observations have resolved these blue lobes into knots of young stars ( mcnamara et al .",
    "a simple explanation for these phenomena is that the radio lobes are compressing the surrounding x - ray emitting gas , which causes it to cool more rapidly and to form stars .    from the moderate increase in the surface brightness of the x - ray emitting gas at the edges of the radio lobes and the fact that the radio pressures are similar to but somewhat higher than the x - ray pressures",
    ", it seems likely that the expansion of the radio lobes ( or other motions ) are mildly supersonic with respect to the x - ray gas . under these conditions ,",
    "the velocities induced in the x - ray gas might be of the order of @xmath56 thus , these motions should be detectable in high resolution x - ray spectra with htxs .      in the previous section",
    ", i noted the anticorrelation which exists between the radio and x - ray images of the inner regions of cluster cooling flows . in some cases",
    ", the x - ray emission appears to be elongated perpendicular to the radio axis .",
    "one explanation of this , discussed above , is that the radio lobes displace the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "another possible explanation is that the x - ray gas in the inner regions forms a flattened rotating configuration , and that this rotating gas eventually feeds an accretion disk around the agn ( sarazin et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "although clusters do not rotate rapidly , the intracluster gas presumably has some small amount of angular momentum .",
    "as the gas cools and contracts into the center of the cooling flow , its rotation speed will increase if the gas preserves it angular momentum .",
    "alternatively , nulsen et al .",
    "( 1984 ) have argued that turbulent viscosity will effectively transport the angular momentum of cooling flow gas outward .",
    "however , if the gas does spin up as it flows inward , it will eventually form a rotating disk .",
    "( mathews discussed galactic equivalents to this in his talk at this meeting . )",
    "such a disk would rotate with a typical speed of @xmath57 and would produce x - ray emission lines with the classical double horned profile of a rotating disk",
    ". these might be detectable in x - ray spectra with htxs , although they have not generally been seen in optical emission line profiles from cooling flows .",
    "cluster cooling flows contain large columns of moderately hot gas , and under some circumstances , resonant x - ray emission lines can be optically thick ( gilfanov et al .",
    "wise & sarazin ( 1996 ) have calculated the spectra of cooling flows including the radiative transfer in the lines .",
    "the optical depths of the lines can reach values as high as @xmath58 , although the opacities are greatest in homogeneous cooling flow models without turbulence .",
    "as noted above (    [ sec : inhomo ] , [ sec : inflow ] , [ sec : turbulent ] ) , these models are probably not very realistic .    the opacity in these lines is due to resonant scattering . in the absence of any source of absorptive opacity",
    "( see   [ sec : excess ] ) , this scattering does nt remove any photons from the lines .",
    "instead , it redistributes photons spatially and in wavelength .",
    "this causes resonant emission lines to appear to come from further out in the cluster , and it changes the line profiles of the scattered photons .",
    "figure  [ fig : thickprofile ] illustrates this effect for the o  viii line toward the center of a homogeneous cooling flow model without turbulence ( wise & sarazin 1996 ) .",
    "there is a reduction in the red wing of the line , which arises in gas flowing toward the center on the near side .",
    "these same resonant lines would appear as absorption lines in the spectra of a bright continuum source lying behind the cluster .",
    "obviously , a background quasar or other agn might provide such a light source . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : radio ] , the central galaxies in cluster cooling flows are often radio galaxies , and in some cases these agn are bright in x - rays .",
    "a particularly interesting case is a1030 , where the central cluster galaxy hosts the radio quasar b2 1028 + 313 .",
    "an x - ray bright agn in the center of a cluster cooling flows provides the ideal geometry for detecting absorption lines .",
    "krolik & raymond ( 1988 ) and sarazin ( 1989 ) showed that the detection of an absorption line toward a background quasar , accompanied by the detection of the same line in emission , would allow a direct determination of the distance to the cluster .",
    "this technique is very similar to the application of the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect . crudely , the strength of the absorption is independent of the distance to the quasar , while the flux of the emission line declines with the square of the distance . comparing",
    "the two provides an estimate of the distance .",
    "while initially discussed for absorption in the spectrum of a quasar behind any region of a cluster , the same technique could be applied to an absorption lines in the spectrum of a central agn due to the surrounding cooling flow .",
    "the ratio of emission flux to absorption optical depth also depends on the density of the gas .",
    "it may be that this technique will be more useful for determining the fluctuations in density of the gas , rather than as a tool in cosmology .      from a reanalysis of the @xmath4 solid state spectrometer ( sss ) spectra of clusters of galaxies , white et al .",
    "( 1991 ) concluded that the spectra of cooling flows require considerable amounts of soft x - ray absorption in excess of the columns through our galaxy .",
    "the excess columns were found to be @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the sss spectra generally covered only the central cooling flow region of the cluster ( @xmath61 kpc ) ; also , in several cases , the rosat pspc has shown that the excess absorption is concentrated to the cluster center , @xmath61 kpc ( allen et al .",
    "1993 ; irwin & sarazin 1995 ) . if the extra absorber is associated with the cluster , then the excess column and area imply a total mass of absorbing material of @xmath62 .",
    "this is quite similar to the total mass of gas ( @xmath63 ) expected to cool out during the lifetime of a cluster ( equation  [ eq : mcool ] ) .",
    "this excess absorption is very important , in that it represents the only direct evidence which has been found for a reservoir for the cooled gas which could contain the total amount of this material .",
    "of course , high resolution x - ray spectra are not needed to detect excess soft x - ray absorption .",
    "observations with the rosat pspc have confirmed the presence of such absorption in a number of cases ( allen et al .",
    "1993 , 1995 ; irwin & sarazin 1995 ) , but there are also a number of strong cooling flows that do not show much evidence for excess absorption ( e.g. , sarazin & mcnamara 1996 ) .",
    "it is obviously of great importance to determine whether this excess absorption is really associated with the cluster cooling flow , as opposed to being a feature in the interstellar medium of our own galaxy .    at the columns of interest ,",
    "the k - edge of oxygen is the dominant spectral feature in the absorption , followed by the edges of nearby elements .",
    "high resolution x - ray spectra could be used to measure the wavelength and shape of the absorption edge .",
    "if the emission is due to gas at the cluster , the edge will be redshifted ( wise & sarazin 1996 ) .",
    "once the redshift is established , measuring the precise wavelength and shape of an absorption edge can provide information on the ionization state of the absorber .",
    "it is currently assumed that the absorption is due to cold atomic or molecular gas or dust grains .",
    "if the excess absorption is associated with the cluster cooling flow , it provides a source of continuum absorption within the flow . as such",
    ", it would be particularly effective at removing optically thick resonant emission lines , which must scatter a number of times before escaping the cluster (   [ sec : optthick ] ; wise & sarazin 1996 ) ."
