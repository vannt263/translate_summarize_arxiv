    "a significant fraction of the total number of type ii supernovae ( sn  ii ) show distinctive features which led schlegel ( 1990 ) to introduce the class of sn  iin .",
    "these objects are characterized by a blue continuum near maximum and a slow temporal evolution of the spectrum ; the slowly declining luminosity in the optical bands and the narrow @xmath2 line profile superimposed on a broad base indicate the presence of diffuse lower velocity matter around the site of the explosion .",
    "because of their relatively high luminosity and slowly declining light curve , the sn  iin are easier to discover than faint , narrow peak light curve objects .",
    "their intrinsic frequency has been estimated by cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to be 5% of all sn  ii .",
    "there is , however , a marked inhomogeneity among the events ( cappellaro & turatto 2001 ) , namely concerning the decline rate of the light curves , a matter which merits understanding .",
    "it has not yet been clarified to what extent individual differences among members of this type of sne can be totally ascribed to the physical properties of pre - existing circumstellar matter ( csm ) .",
    "in fact , recent attempts to explain the long term properties of visual light curves ( lcs ) with light echoes from circumstellar matter by roscherr & schaefer ( 2000 ) have not been fully successful .",
    "there are observational features which disagree with echo model predictions , forcing these authors to conclude that any pre - existing dust around the site of the explosion must be almost completely destroyed at the moment of the outburst .",
    "however , this contrasts with the observed late infrared emission from sn  1998s , which has been inferred to result from dust cooling ( fassia et al .",
    "based on their observational data , fassia et al .",
    "argue that dust was already present within the precursor wind of sn  1998s , and hence at least a fraction of it must have survived the explosion .",
    "this suggests that improved observations are needed in order to understand the environment of sn sites from this diagnostic tool .",
    "so far only a few of the models developed to test the effects of light echoes have taken into account the near infrared ( nir ) light curves ( see emmering & chevalier 1988 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the slow decline of light curves for type iin sne appears to be well accounted for by simple models of ejecta - wind interactions ( terlevich 1994 ; plewa 1995 ) . at the same time , the peculiar shape of the emission lines has been also attributed to ejecta - wind interactions involving a two - component wind , characterized by dense clumps ( or a dense equatorial wind ) associated with a less dense spherically symmetric distribution ( chugai & danziger 1994 ) .    therefore , several open questions remain , which can be formulated as follows :    1 .",
    "how important is the issue of the inhomogeneity of this class of events and what causes this inhomogeneity ? 2 .   what is the evolutionary scenario causing some massive precursors of sne to explode within a pre - existing envelope of diffuse circumstellar matter and what physical mechanisms affect the observational properties ? 3",
    "is dust present in the csm before the explosion ? 4 .   to what extent do echo processes and ejecta - wind interactions",
    "determine the observational properties of such sne ?    in this paper",
    "we present optical and infrared data for the type iin sn 1999el .",
    "the present work provides new photometric measurements and improves the observational constraints on this class of sne .",
    "observations and data reduction are presented in section 2 .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sections 3 and 4 , and summarized in section 5 .",
    "sn  1999el was discovered on october 20.45 ut ( julian day 2451472 ) at mag @xmath3 ( unfiltered ) by the bao sn survey ( cao et al .  1999 , iauc 7288 ) @xmath4 east and @xmath5 south of the galactic nucleus of ngc  6951 , an inclined ( @xmath6 ) barred spiral galaxy hosting a type 2 seyfert agn , located at @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see fig .",

    "the estimated distance moduli range from 31.85 mag ( 23.4 mpc ) to 32.59 mag ( 33 mpc ) , where the lowest values are based on the tully - fisher relation and the highest ones on the multi - color light curve shape ( mlcs ) method applied to the sn  2000e ( a type ia sn ) .",
    "we adopt our own determination ( @xmath9 mag ) based on our observations of sn  2000e ( see valentini et al .",

    "cao et al .  ( 1999 ) report no trace of the sn on images taken on october 19.2 by kait ( to a limiting magnitude of 18 ) and on october 19.44 by bao , so we can assume october 20.00 as the zero point for the light curves , since it must be very close ( within a few hours ) to the shock breakout time . according to cao et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , an image taken on october 21.44 indicates a magnitude of @xmath10 for the supernova , whereas on october 22.2 it appeared at a magnitude of @xmath11 ( no band is indicated ) .",

    "[ gal : sn ] that sn  1999el is projected between two nearby foreground stars ( c2 and c3 ) with a separation of no more than a couple of arcsec .",
    "optical photometry of sn  1999el  has been obtained on images collected with several telescopes at different sites in the northern hemisphere .",
    "these were reduced using the standard techniques for de - biasing and flat - fielding .",
    "one set of data comes from the 0.72-m teramo - normale telescope ( tnt ) , at the teramo observatory ( italy ) .",

    "the pixel size of 27 @xmath13 m yields a scale of @xmath14 arcsec / pixel . during each observational night we obtained 4 to 12 frames per filter in the b , r and i bands .    other photometry was performed on images obtained with the 1-m telescope operated by the observatorio astronmico nacional in tonantzintla ( mexico ) , equipped in the f/15 cassegrain port with a 1024@xmath151024 thomson thx  31156 ccd and a cousins @xmath16 filter .",

    "the 1.8-m telescope of the osservatorio astronomico di padova sited in asiago , cima ekar ( italy ) , equipped with afosc , was used .",
    "the instrument is a focal reducer type spectrograph / camera with a 1k @xmath15 1k site thinned ccd ( @xmath21 m ) .",
    "the scale of @xmath22/pixel gives a field of @xmath23 arcmin@xmath24 .",
    "some photometric data were acquired using the 2.1-m telescope of the guillermo haro observatory in cananea ( mexico ) , equipped with the spectrophotometer lfosc at the f/12 cassegrain focus .",
    "johnson @xmath25 and cousins @xmath16 filters were used .",
    "the chip is a @xmath26 eev  p8693 , with a field of view of @xmath27 .",
    "this was read in the standard readout mode : 8@xmath19/pixel , 4.7@xmath19/adu .",
    "the effective on - chip integration of the sn field was split into 2 to 3 integrations of 60 s in the @xmath16-band and of 120 s in the @xmath25-band .",
    "late time @xmath28 photometry was obtained with the optical imager galileo ( oig ) mounted on the 3.58-m italian national telescope ( tng , roque de los muchachos , la palma , canary islands ) and equipped with a mosaic of two thinned , back - illuminated eev42 - 80 ccds with @xmath29 pixels each ( pixel size @xmath30 @xmath13 m ; pixel scale in @xmath18 binned mode @xmath31/pixel ) .",
    "these nights were photometric and were used to calibrate the local sequence around the sn ( 1 to 8 , see fig .",
    "[ gal : sn ] ) which in turn was used for calibrating non - photometric nights .",
    "the instrumental color equations were obtained through observations of stars in the standard fields of landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "three of the local standards ( 1 , 3 and 5 ) are a subset of those selected by vink et al . (",
    "2001 ) to carry out differential photometry ( @xmath32 ) on sn2000e ( their f1 , b1 , b3 , respectively ) .",
    "the magnitudes adopted in our and their study for those sources agree within @xmath33 mag , with two exceptions : we found our star 1 to be @xmath34 mag brighter in @xmath16 and our star 5 to be @xmath34 mag brighter in @xmath35 .",
    "the agreement can be considered good and confirms the validity of both our calibration and that of those authors .",
    "however , our measurements were obtained using a larger telescope ( the tng ) under very good seeing and photometric conditions .",
    "this should have afforded us a better sky subtraction which , particularly at longer wavelengths , may be easily affected by nebular emission from the host galaxy .    during the sn  1999el  follow - up observations , another sn event occurred within ngc  6951 ( i.   e. , sn  2000e ) , so the ccd at the tnt was operated to image the 2 objects on the same frame .",
    "the exposure times were chosen so as to achieve the best signal - to - noise ratio for both supernovae , but avoiding saturation of the brightest calibration star in the field .",
    "since both supernovae are well embedded in the galaxy background , we obtained instrumental magnitudes by point - spread function ( psf ) fitting using the daophot package in iraf or a set of procedures developed for sn photometry in the same environment . for the tnt and tonantzintla observations ,",
    "the final instrumental magnitudes were obtained as an average of all valid values derived for a given night .",
    "errors have been obtained with artificial star experiments , i.e. placing stars of the same magnitude as the supernova in parts of the galaxy arm characterized by similar complexity as the sn site , then computing the r.m.s . of the derived magnitudes . for tnt images",
    "however , the uncertainty in the photometry has been estimated by evaluating the psf fit residuals and the r.m.s . of the @xmath36 successive measurements obtained in a single night for the sn after calibration through the local standards .",
    "it is more difficult to assess the error due to the convolution of the psfs of the sn and the nearby sources when their brightness becomes comparable and the seeing is poor , which is the case in the tnt photometry at late epochs .",
    "hence , we omit measurements which appear uncertain because of the inferior quality of the images .",

    "[ f : cc ] ) . comparing the sn colors with the main sequence locus ( solid line ) , the blackbody locus ( dashed line ) and the reddening law ( arrow ) , a nir excess is evident even at early epochs and this can not be simply explained as reddened blackbody or stellar photospheric emission . after day 5 , the colors evolve roughly along a track which appears almost parallel to the reddening law , evolving as if a@xmath169 decreases with time .",
    "however , on day 219 , a strong @xmath44 excess is present .",
    "the most likely cause for the nir excess is continuum emission from hot dust pre - existing within the csm of sn  1999el .",

    "[ bbfs ] , we can determine the radius of a blackbody surface emitting the same luminosity in @xmath44 at 1500 k , roughly the dust sublimation temperature . it can be shown that reddening does not change the result by more than a 1020% .",
    "this radius , @xmath172 cm , is comparable to the light travel distance from the explosion time to day 5 , @xmath173 cm .",
    "thus the two independently determined distances are consistent with the presence of dust at a radius where it has not sublimated and radiates at ir wavelengths as a result of heating by uv photons from the original outburst .      in order to give an estimate of the absolute luminosity of sn  1999el  it is necessary to determine its reddening . as can be seen in fig .",

    "the exact time of maxima at @xmath43 and @xmath44 bands is uncertain but they seem to have occurred some time before the beginning of our observations .",
    "the differences may be appreciated by looking at the color curves shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] .",
    "as previously noted , the evolution of @xmath161 and @xmath162 for sn  1999el  exhibits an early appearance of a nir excess ( around day 5 ) and a nir blueing effect in the first @xmath163 days .",
    "this seems observationally well established , since here the nir lcs sample the sn when it was much brighter than the nearby sources c2 and c3 ( see fig .  [ gal : sn ] ) , and thus are easily measurable even though sometimes only partially resolved on swircam images .",
    "although maxima at nir wavelengths do appear to have been missed for sn  1998s , nevertheless there is no evidence for an early blueing effect in this case .",
    "furthermore , a nir excess from sn  1998s is not apparent at early epochs .",
    "one possible origin of the quoted differences , in particular of the early nir excess may be due to an ir echo from pre - existing dust in the vicinity of sn  1999elnot evaporated at the moment of the shock outburst .",
    "this would suggest that dust clumps near sn  1999el  are distributed differently than those near sn  1998s which may be devoid of nearby dust entirely . for sn  1998s",
    "this is supported by leonard et al .",
    "( 2000 ) whose spectroscopic observations suggest that the progenitor of sn  1998s underwent a major mass - loss episode that ended some 60 years before the explosion , followed by a weaker scarcely detectable mass - loss activity in the last seven years before the explosion .",
    "if a mass - loss wind associated with the sn  1999el  progenitor had not ceased at the time of explosion , the density of the csm around it would be much larger than in the case of sn  1998s .    in the above scenario , the interaction of the uv flash with the csm around sn  1999el  would have led to heating , destruction and sublimation of dust .",
    "the extent of the region where grain sublimation and destruction can occur may be estimated as ( see , e.  g. , waxman & draine 2000 ) @xmath342 where @xmath343 is the grain absorption efficiency at uv wavelengths , @xmath344 the maximum luminosity in the range 17.5 ev in units of @xmath345 erg s@xmath1 ( optical - uv flash ) and @xmath346 the mean size of grains in units of @xmath347 @xmath13 m . assuming @xmath348 and @xmath349 , @xmath350 cm is obtained for a maximum luminosity of @xmath351 erg s@xmath1 ( the greatest value indicated in table  [ lboltab ] ) , a distance which is two orders of magnitude larger than the largest photospheric radius attained by the supernova ( see table  [ lboltab ] ) , but also somewhat greater than the estimate based on the occurrence of the nir excess very early ( see sect .",
    "[ lc : d ] ) . since the grain distruction and sublimation due to the uv flash imply also the unlocking of fe ions ( if they exist in the dust )",
    ", we have been tempted to ascribe the early 45 days blueing to [ feii ] line emission .",
    "the [ feii ] lines which may affect @xmath42 and @xmath43 bands result from the transitions involving metastable levels @xmath352d@xmath353@xmath354d@xmath355 ( @xmath356 @xmath13 m , a@xmath357 s@xmath1 ) and @xmath354f@xmath353@xmath352d@xmath355 ( @xmath358 @xmath13 m , a@xmath359 s@xmath1 ) , collisionally excited by free electrons ( see mouri , kawara , & taniguchi 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "very large line integrated fluxes ( up to 0.51 times the continuum flux integrated on the @xmath44 band ; see fig .",
    "[ f : cc ] ) would be required to produce the observed changes in colors , indicating that [ feii ] lines alone can not account for it . in addition , since relative luminosity of the main [ feii ] lines in the j and h windows is constant , the contribution of this mechanism to the color evolution is definitively ruled out .",
    "if the early ir excess of sn  1999el  is due to the presence of a csm generated by a continuous wind of the progenitor star , it might be reasonable to expect its signature in the optical light curves .",
    "this seems not to be the case .",
    "roscherr and schaefer ( 2000 ) analysed theoretically the modifications of optical lcs supernovae produced by echo processes .",
    "they assume spherical symmetry for the dust and find that critical parameters are @xmath360 , @xmath361 and @xmath362 , where @xmath360 and @xmath361 are the inner and outer radii of the dust shell and @xmath362 the optical depth in the @xmath16 band for a purely radial photon trajectory , a quantity directly related with the total mass of dust .",
    "roscherr and schaefer ( 2000 ) find that , in the case of thick shells , @xmath362 is the more sensitive parameter .",
    "changes in @xmath362 effect changes in the luminosity of light maxima in various bands whose amounts depend on the wavelength range .",
    "even the time at which the light maximum is attained may be shifted ( by up to several days ; roscherr , private communication ) according to its wavelength .",
    "unfortunately , these computations do not address the nir bands .",
    "the decline rate is also strongly affected by changes in @xmath362 at levels once again dependent on wavelength . in this respect",
    "a relevant parameter is the @xmath363 index which corresponds to the luminosity drop in 100 days in the @xmath182 band .",
    "therefore the @xmath363 index can provide information on the presence of a csm around the sn .",
    "observational data provide a value of @xmath363 greater than 4 mag for both sn  1999el  and 1998s .",
    "a comparison with the theoretical results quoted above suggests the surprising result that the expected amount of dust surrounding both sn  1999el  and sn  1998s should be vanishingly small .",
    "( or that almost all the pre - existing dust is evaporated at the moment of the uv flash ) .    for sn",
    "1999el  this result is in contrast with the suggestion that the early ir excess is due to an ir echo caused by near - by dust .",
    "we suggest that the failure of the @xmath363 index to display the presence of csm around sn  1999el  may be ascribed to the assumption made to derive theoretically this index , namely the assumption of spherically distributed dust .",
    "the theoretical results of emmering and chevalier ( 1988 ) on the ir echo light originated by an asymmetric csm distribution around a sn progenitor clearly illustrate how many parameters influence the observed results .",
    "indeed they find that ir light curves can substantially change by varying the geometrical properties of a given non - spherical ( but still axi - symmetric ) csm distribution and/or its orientation relative to the line of sight . even if not explicitly accounted for in their work it can be nevertheless deduced that additional parameters , such as a non - radial density profile of the dust , play an additional pivotal role .",
    "we intend in the future to provide a tentative model of the dust distribution around sn  1999el  .",
    "finally we note that both for sn  1998s ( fassia et al .",
    "2000 ) and sn  1999el  the observations do not rule out a scenario of dust formation after the explosion . in the case of sn",
    "1999elan occurrence like this would imply that the signature of dust appears both at early and also at late stages . in particular",
    ", for sn  1999el assuming a@xmath169 @xmath364 mag , the dereddened @xmath44 magnitude on jd+691 ( see table  [ nir : phot ] ) yields an observed flux of @xmath365 erg @xmath171 s@xmath1 @xmath13m@xmath1 . as in sect .",
    "[ lc : d ] , we can determine the radius of a blackbody - emitting surface for a temperature of 1500 k , which is roughly the sublimation temperature for dust grains .",
    "this amounts to @xmath366 cm , of the order of the largest photospheric radius attained ( see table  [ lboltab ] ) , a distance that might be covered by dust formed in the ejecta moving with a velocity @xmath367 km s@xmath1 .",
    "therefore the scenario we propose embraces the evolution of the progenitor star in that cold , high - luminosity , mass loss from evolved massive stars may proceed in episodes with asymmetric distributions .",
    "it is however conceivable that single mass - loss episodes are not completely stochastic in duration , periodicity and intensity .",
    "over long temporal intervals , possibly covering several cycles of activity , it is possible to define mean wind properties , such as , for example , the dependence of the mean mass - loss rate on the main structural parameters such as temperature and luminosity .",
    "if the sn explosion occurs during a long pause in mass - loss we observe a normal type ii sn , otherwise the typical features of the type iin sne will appear with varying degrees of visibility .",
    "optical and nir light curves have been presented for the type iin sn  1999el .",
    "these data , in comparison with those of sn  1998s , suggest that the progenitor star of sn  1999el   was still undergoing a probably asymmetric mass loss episode at the moment of the explosion .",
    "dust was already present in the expanding circumstellar envelope .",
    "dust lying in the inner @xmath368 cm evaporated at the outburst .",
    "later , on , the evolution of nir colors seems to be affected by the echo light from a pre - existing asymmetrically expanding envelope . in the absence of mass loss sn  1999el  would have been presumably observed as a bona - fide linear type ii sn .",
    "the way in which mass loss occurs in the last evolutionary phases of massive stars seems to be responsible for various observed departures of type ii sne from the standard ii - l and ii - p behavior .",
    "this paper is partially based on observations made with the italian telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) operated on the island of la palma by the centro galileo galilei of the cnaa ( consorzio nazionale per lastronomia e lastrofisica ) at the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
    "the infrared data collected with the azt-24 are products of the supernova watch - dogging infrared telescope ( swirt ) , a joint project of the astronomical observatories of collurania - teramo ( italy ) , pulkovo ( russia ) and rome ( italy ) .",
    "we thank f.  ghinassi and f.  mannucci for acquiring the latest nir images with nics .",
    "we warmly thank bruce roscherr for advice and suggestions about the echo light issue .",
