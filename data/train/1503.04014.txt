    "quantum degenerate gases of dipolar particles is a forefront research topic in cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "while losses can be a problem when dipolar forces are strong @xcite , it has been experimentally demonstrated that losses can be suppressed by confinement in lower - dimensional geometries @xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of realizing interesting lower - dimensional phenomena driven by long - range interactions in both few - body @xcite and many - body @xcite physics .",
    "an overall goal is to realize a quantum simulator with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "a recent drive in experiments has been to produce dipolar gases using heteronuclear molecules with large dipoles moments @xcite .",
    "it is then expected that one can see strong dipolar effects already before reaching degeneracy .",
    "when the dipolar energy scale exceeds the energy scale set by the temperature of the system one may expect to see crystal formation in the classical sense .",
    "the regime where strong dipolar forces are the dominant feature of the system is the focus of the present paper , and we will thus ignore thermal effects .",
    "we will be considering a geometry where the dipolar particles can move in two dimensions and where an external field is used to align the dipole moments at any fixed angle with respect to the plane of motion .",
    "we note that near the magic angle ( to be defined below ) where two dipoles on a line will have vanishing dipolar interaction energy , a normal mode in the crystal will approach zero excitation energy . in this regime , we do except quantum and thermal fluctuations to play an important role , but leave this question for future studies .    in constrast to the famous wigner crystals that have been predicted for systems with coulomb interactions at low density @xcite",
    ", the crystal phases should be found at high density when the particles have dipolar interactions .",
    "some earlier works have considered dipoles oriented perpendicular to the motional plane both classically @xcite and quantum mechanically @xcite .",
    "this leads to a dipole - dipole force that only depends on the relative distance thus strongly simplifying the problem .",
    "another line of investigation has been dipoles on a two - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "some of the latter works have used different orientations of the dipoles with respect to the lattice . in this case the dipole - dipole interactions no longer cylindrically symmetry in the plane but can be highly anisotropic .",
    "this may lead to striped systems as indicated in different response function approaches @xcite .",
    "it may as well lead to new unexpected properties like the roton minimum in helium @xcite .",
    "we note that similar physical issue can be studied using externally oriented magnetic colloids @xcite .    naturally , these possibilities complicate both classical and quantum mechanical approaches .",
    "classical properties of crystals are crucial ingredients for subsequent quantization @xcite , and investigations of quantum effects like melting point and heat capacity @xcite . in the current work",
    "we assume that the dipole moments are strong such that classical methods are accurate and consider dipolar particles in a plane with no predefined lattice , i.e. the particles can move continuously .",
    "the question then becomes whether , or perhaps more appropriately when , the crystal structure starts to change significantly from the hexagonal crystal structure that is found when the dipoles are aligned perpendicular to the plane of motion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ methods ] we describe the theoretical model and the parametrization of the most general crystal structure in the plane for arbitrary orientation of the dipoles . sec .",
    "[ results ] outlines the results for the crystal structure itself . in sec .",
    "[ phonon1 ] we elaborate on the properties of the minimal energy crystal configuration .",
    "we calculate the phonon spectrum by outlining a proper parametrization of the reciprocal lattice before presenting the spectra along with the sound velocity .",
    ".  [ sum ] contains a short summary and an outlook .",
    "the technical details of the calculations of the phonon spectrum are presented in appendix  [ appa ] .     and @xmath0 , describing the direction of the dipole moment , @xmath1 . ]",
    "in order to determine the crystal structures for different aligned dipole moments of the particles , we need to develop a convenient parametrization of the geometry . we imagine a system with a number of particles distributed on a section of a plane in lattice - like structures . instead of the number of particles in the allowed space it is much better to use the density of particles ( an inverse area in 2d ) as a decisive parameter .",
    "the anticipated regular structure can then easily be broken down into unit cells repeating each other across the plane .",
    "the choice of parametrization is intrinsically connected to the interactions between the particles .",
    "we therefore first examine the details of the dipole - dipole potential and subsequently in the next subsection we describe the parametrization of the unit cell .",
    "all dipoles are assumed to be identical with a given dipole moment of size @xmath2 .",
    "they all have the same orientation induced by the application of an external magnetic or electric field .",
    "the direction of the dipole moments is given by the angles @xmath3 , @xmath0 ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipol ] . the dipole moment itself , @xmath1",
    "is then described by @xmath4 the interaction energy between two of these dipoles , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the vector between the two dipoles , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 for magnetic and electric dipoles , respectively . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the vacuum permeability and vacuum permittivity , respectively .",
    "below we will assume magnetic dipoles .",
    "results for electric dipoles can be obtained by simply making the substitution @xmath14 .",
    "-axis separated a distance @xmath15 from each other .",
    "both directions are described by the same @xmath16 as in fig .",

    "we now assume that the two dipoles are placed on the @xmath17-axis at a distance @xmath15 and described by the angles @xmath18 and @xmath0 . for identical dipole moments @xmath19 the potential energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : interaktion ] is reduced to @xmath20 since @xmath8 is taken along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "we thus see that the interaction energy is positive as long as @xmath21 we therefore conclude that the interaction is repulsive for all @xmath0 when @xmath22 . thus ,",
    "collapse due to attractive inverse cubic interactions can not occur for @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the @xmath24 dependence implies a symmetry around @xmath25 corresponding to reflection in the @xmath26-plane where all dipoles are assumed to be located .      when comparing different crystal structures we must consider the conditions we impose on the system .",
    "we imagine that the crystal forms from a gas phase that condenses by cooling .",
    "consequently the crystal structures most likely prefer to have a constant density of dipoles in the plane , i.e. we do not have clumping or holes in the crystal .",
    "we thus assume an ideal uniform crystal structure .",
    "it is of course very interesting to study the effect of crystal defects in both a classical and quantum mechanical setting but this is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we therefore aim at determining the preferred regular crystal structure for a given alignment of the many dipole moments distributed to produce a given average density in the @xmath26-plane .",
    "we then need to find the configuration that minimizes the total interaction energy for such specification of the system .",
    "the total interaction energy , @xmath27 , is @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are position vectors of each pair of dipoles interacting through the potential , @xmath31 , in eq .  .",
    "we need a sensible unit cell that can be used to parametrize the crystal structure for given external alignment .",
    "an important limit to consider is the one of perpendicular dipoles , i.e. when all the dipole moments are aligned perpendicular ( @xmath32 ) to the plane containing all the particles . in this case",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is purely repulsive with a @xmath33 behavior that only depends on the relative distance .",
    "the system will try to maximize the distance between each pair of dipoles and not allow any clusterization or irregular correlations ( at least in the ideal crystal we investigate ) .",
    "finding the minimum energy configuration for this system is therefore the same problem as the packing of spheres .",
    "this problem is known to have a hexagonal solution in 2d @xciteand we therefore must be able to capture this geometry with our unit cell parametrization .",
    "-plane where the @xmath34-axis is perpendicular to the plane with the particles .",
    "the unit cell is shown in the bottom left corner with bold lines .",
    "the parametrization contains two variables , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath35 determines the angle in the lattice , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the distance between nearest neighbors in the @xmath17- and the @xmath35-directions , respectively . with this choice we can parametrize all uniform crystal structures . ]    to allow sufficient flexibility we choose the unit cell shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opstilling ] . the two variables @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath36 allow us to describe all uniform crystal structures with @xmath37 as the crystal lattice length .",

    "the value of @xmath37 can be determined as function of @xmath18 and @xmath36 to maintain a given average density of dipoles in the resulting crystal .",
    "this can be imposed by insisting that the unit cell area remains constant as we change the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the density , @xmath41 , is inversely proportional to the area , @xmath42 , of the unit cell .",
    "the constraint on @xmath37 is then @xmath43 the two unit cell basis vectors , @xmath44 , connecting nearest neighbors in the two principal directions are @xmath45    we may now exploit the symmetries of the unit cell . as mentioned before there is a symmetry around @xmath46 .",
    "there is also a symmetry resulting in @xmath47 where the energy is invariant under translation of @xmath0 by @xmath48 .",
    "this can easily be seen by the invariance of rotating the unit cell 180 degrees around the @xmath34-axis , e.g. rotating around the central point in fig .",
    "[ fig : opstilling ] .",
    "it can also be seen by looking at the expression for the dipole interaction in eq .  .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 goes as @xmath49 and this is invariant under rotations by @xmath48 .",
    "we can therefore reduce the parameter space and work with @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "it is important to note that the external alignment of the dipoles fixes @xmath18 as the angle between the @xmath34-axis and the direction of the external electric or magnetic field .",
    "the other angle , @xmath0 , describes the angle between the arbitrarily chosen @xmath17-axis of the unit cell and the projection on the crystal plane of the aligned dipole moments .",
    "the calculational procedure will therefore be to fix @xmath18 and @xmath0 , and then minimize the energy with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this will for each @xmath18 produce an energy as a function of @xmath0 and the minimum will then define the preferred crystal structure for this given @xmath18 .    in general a complicated topology may invalidate this procedure of fixing one parameter , minimizing with respect to two other parameters , and afterwards find minimum of the resulting function of the first parameter .",
    "all three variables should perhaps be varied simultaneously to find true global or local minima . to confirm that our procedure provided correct minima we tested by numerical variation of the parameters around the minima .",
    "the structure of uniform crystals with constant planar density of dipoles has been determined as function of polarization angles .",
    "we shall here present the resulting configurations for a number of angles that illustrate the general behavior .",
    "we will start with @xmath32 ( independent of @xmath0 ) .",
    "subsequently we increase @xmath18 up to the critical value , @xmath52 , for collapse due to unhindered small - distance attraction .",
    "we shall investigate how the crystal evolves for different external alignments of the dipoles , that is for the interval @xmath53 where @xmath0 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 assume correlated values minimizing the total energy .",
    "we emphasize again that @xmath35 and @xmath36 describe the crystal structure in fig .",

    "it is indeed the simplest case yet it is a relevant benchmark to demonstrate the validity of our method . the total interaction energy from eq .   as a function of @xmath35 and @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : overflade ] .",
    "energies are plotted in units of @xmath57 where the density of dipoles , @xmath41 , is kept constant in all calculations .",
    "as expected , we find that the minimum in energy occurs when @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the unit cell of the corresponding hexagonal lattice structure of lowest energy is shown in fig .  [ fig : trivistruk ] .",
    "note that for @xmath32 there is a triangular symmetry which is the result of the rotational symmetry in the plane for @xmath32 which is broken down to the point - group symmetry of the hexagonal lattice when the crystal forms .",

    "[ fig : overflade ] from the minimum in the direction of smaller @xmath36 for fixed @xmath60 .",

    "the structure is rather similar to that of @xmath135 .",
    "accordingly the changes in the phonon spectrum is small although noticeable .",
    "the complete hexagonal symmetry is broken and a @xmath0-dependence of the interaction energy appear for finite values of @xmath18 , see fig . [",

    "the symmetry is no longer perfect even for a small value of @xmath141 , but the symmetry points remains in the reciprocal lattice sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : reci trivi ] .",
    "the degeneracy in the point @xmath134 is lifted and the two branches begin to move away from each other at this point .    increasing @xmath18 changes the structure substantially especially towards the critical value @xmath52 .",
    "the results for increasing @xmath18 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spektre-0,1 ] for three larger illustrative values . for @xmath142 the degeneracy at point @xmath134 has now clearly disappeared and a significant gap has appeared .",
    "the spectrum still maintain the same features and the same overall appearance .",
    "now a small minimum appears on the longitudinal branch close to the point @xmath134 .",
    "this minimum is present for all spectra in the interval from @xmath143 .",
    "after appearance it first becomes deeper but as @xmath18 grows so does the frequency at @xmath134 and for @xmath144 the minimum is altogether washed out .",
    "the significance of this minimum could possible be a signal of roton dynamics in the crystal in analogy to that of helium @xcite .",
    "such rotons have been predicted and discussed also for particles with dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "it is clearly related to deformation of the crystal , but we postpone more detailed investigations to future work .    increasing @xmath18 to @xmath145 and beyond , we see that the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spektre-0,1 ] change appearance .",
    "the point @xmath133 moves closer to @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ fig : reci trivi ] .",
    "we note that no new minima appear beside the kink at @xmath134 in the transversal frequency for @xmath146 .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath147 is apparently more distorted with kinks or abruptly changing values .",
    "however , we emphasize that the @xmath17-axes on fig . [",
    "fig : spektre-0,1 ] do not reflect real distances .",
    "it is merely the result of the choice of discrete wave vectors @xmath117 , and the subsequent distance between points on the figures .",
    "therefore the variation is not a realistic signal representative for any physical effect .    .",
    "here @xmath148 . ]      with the phonon spectrum available we calculate the speed of sound , @xmath149 , from eq .   in the point , @xmath119 , in both transverse and longitudinal directions .",
    "the results are seen to be the derivatives of the frequency curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] and [ fig : spektre-0,1 ] .",
    "each configuration then has longitudinal and transversal values for the speed of sound as shown in in fig .",
    "[ fig : sound ] as functions of @xmath18 .",
    "for the hexagonal structure , @xmath32 , we find @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , in the natural units of @xmath152 .",
    "both longitudinal and transversal velocities decrease continuously and relatively slowly with @xmath18 .",
    "there is a tendency to speed up the reduction as the critical polarization angle is approached .",
    "this is intuitively understandable , since the structure for @xmath153 approaches separated straight lines as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : struktur-0 - 0,6 ] .",
    "the frequencies decrease when the instability is approached , and correspondingly the speed of sound must decrease .",
    "this instability in also clear to see in bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spektre-0,1 ] where we see the normal mode going towards zero energy at the point @xmath133 .",
    "using a classical analysis we have determined the structure , the phonon spectrum , and the speed of sound for dipolar crystals in two dimensions with different polarization of the dipole moments with respect to the two - dimensional plane of motion .",
    "this analysis has been restricted to polarization angles less than the critical angle for dipole - dipole collapse .",
    "this ensures that the overall interaction is repulsive so that one avoids collapse due to head - to - tail attraction of the dipoles .    for perpendicular orientation , we find the expected hexagonal crystal structure . as the polarization angle increases ,",
    "we observe a distortion of the crystal lattice and the structure changes towards a more square type of lattice .",
    "this is associated with the increasing tendency for the system to prefer stripes of dipoles .",
    "the physics of this deformation is associated with the decreasing repulsive energy felt by two dipoles as they are tilted away from perpendicular orientation .",
    "the optimal energy configuration therefore becomes one where dipoles are placed on lines and effectively makes a striped system .",
    "indications of stripe formation have also been found in different response function approaches @xcite .",
    "as we have demonstrated above , the transition from hexagonal toward a striped character of the system is particularly clear in the phonon spectrum and in the speed of sound of the system .",
    "measurements of phonon dispersions and speeds of sound would therefore be a promising way to experimentally probe the crystal .",
    "interestingly , we find that the phonon spectrum for increasing tilt angles develops some local minima analogous to the roton minima seen in helium .",
    "these new minima occur in positions different from the ones found in the case of perpendicular orientation and are thus associated with the deformation of the crystal structure .",
    "our study provides the basis for including quantum mechanical effects in the system .",
    "this becomes important once the dipolar interaction strength is comparable to the kinetic energy of the zero - point motion in the crystal which occurs for weak dipole moments . when the zero - point energy is large we expect strong quantum fluctuations and suppression of crystal formation . including these effects",
    ", one can investigate melting transitions and heat capacity due to quantum motion .",
    "this can be done by using canonical quantization of the phonon modes and/or via a lindemann criterion approach",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .",
    "the derivation will follow the derivation in chapter 22 in ashcroft and mermin ( 1976)@xcite .    as mentioned before the energy of a structure",
    "is calculated as @xmath154 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the position vectors of each dipole in the structure and @xmath0 is the interaction potential between two dipoles .",
    "we introduce a small perturbation in the system as @xmath155 insert this in the expression for the energy , @xmath156 an expansion of the potential is made in @xmath157 , @xmath158 all terms of order @xmath159 are removed as a harmonic approximation a is made .",
    "this is appropriate as vibrations should be small for zero kelvin .",
    "the zeroth order term will in principle be an infinite term but it will not be relevant for motion",
    ". the linear term will not be relevant as we assume all particles to be at minimum positions and will therefore be zero . the harmonic term , @xmath160\\\\&\\frac{\\partial ^2 \\phi ( \\vec{r}-\\vec{r'})}{\\partial r_\\mu \\partial r_\\nu } [ u_\\nu ( \\vec{r } ) - u_\\nu ( \\vec{r ' } ) ] .",
    "\\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be rewritten to something more useful @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "because @xmath163 , and because @xmath29 and @xmath30 express the same points it will , per symmetry , be that @xmath164 .",
    "the harmonic term will again be rewritten as @xmath165 a new notation is introduced so only one term is present : @xmath166 where @xmath167 and the sum allows @xmath168 . introduce a matrix notation instead : @xmath169 this matrix is symmetric as a result of @xmath170 .",
    "it it also clear that @xmath171 can be expressed as : @xmath113 now two equations of motion can be made for each particle @xmath172 here the differential has removed two sums in the expression , m is the mass of each dipole and @xmath173 is the force in the @xmath174th direction .",
    "these equations can then be collected in vector notation as @xmath175 solving these equations require us to make the ansatz : @xmath176 where @xmath117 is a wavevector .",
    "this results in : @xmath177 because both @xmath29 and @xmath30 describe all positions in the infinite structure we now make the substitution @xmath178 and get : @xmath179 where @xmath180 .",
    "the expression has now been reduced to a eigenvalue equation which can be solved for a given @xmath117 .",
    "if the structure would be of finite proportions there would be restrictions on the allowed values of @xmath117 but if infinite it could have any value in the first brillouin zone .",
    "as the matrix has real values , is symmetric and of dimension 2 there will be two real eigenvalues with two orthogonal eigenvectors which fulfils : @xmath181 from this @xmath182 belonging to @xmath183 can be found as @xmath184      s. ospelkaus _",
