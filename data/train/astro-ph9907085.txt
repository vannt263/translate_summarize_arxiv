    "in order to drive gas from the outer disk to the nucleus of a spiral galaxy , from scales of tens of kpc to tens of pc , the angular momentum of the gas must be reduced by around six orders of magnitude .",
    "it is now accepted that a wide variety of phenomena involving torques and dissipation can drive gas from the outer disk into the circumnuclear ( inner kpc ) region .",
    "non - axisymmetric features ( simkin et al . 1980 ) such as isolated and induced primary bars ( schwarz 1984 ; noguchi 1988 ) , as well as tidal interactions and mergers ( negroponte & white 1983 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ) can be relevant . however , it is less clear how gas can be driven from scales of kpc to tens of pc .",
    "shocks associated with the primary bar tend to weaken in the inner part of the galaxy and can not drive further inflow ( shlosman et al .",
    "1989 ) . numerical simulations ( e.g. , combes & gerin 1985 ) and observations ( e.g. , kenney et al . 1992 ) show that gas often piles up in rings near inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) . some studies ( e.g. ,",
    "combes & gerin 1985 ) have suggested that gravity torques reverse near ilrs , and thereby stall the transport of gas towards the galactic center . in order to overcome this transport barrier , theory ( shlosman et al .",
    "1989 ) and simulations ( friedli & martinet 1993 ; combes 1994 ; heller & shlosman 1994 ) have suggested that nuclear bars nested within a primary bar ( or ` bars within bars ' ) can be efficient mechanisms for driving gas closer to the galactic center to fuel central starbursts and agns .    from the observational standpoint ,",
    "there is mounting evidence from optical and nir surveys that a large number of galaxies have nuclear stellar bars ( buta & crocker 1993 ; wozniak et al .",

    "such observations are highly desirable to constrain formation scenarios and typical lifetimes of nuclear bars , as well as to assess their relative importance with respect to other fuelling mechanisms .",
    "the current work presents evidence that the peculiar galaxy ngc  2782 ( arp 215 ) harbors a massive bar - like molecular feature of radius 1.3 kpc and a similarly - sized nuclear stellar bar which appears to be fuelling molecular gas into the inner 200 pc radius , where resides a powerful central starburst , comparable in intensity to the archetypal starburst m82 .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 , where diamonds and crosses represent the k - band and i - band data respectively : * ( a ) the ellipticity profile of the k - band light shows an inner ellipticity maximum ( 0.28 ) over which the pa maintains an approximately constant value ( 100 @xmath32 ) . beyond a radius of @xmath2 @xmath3 ( 1.3 kpc ) ,",

    "further out , given the low signal - to noise in the k - band image , we use the i - band image , where the ellipticity falls from 0.26 to below 0.1 in the outer disk , at radii@xmath0 @xmath40 ( 8.5 kpc ) .",
    "* *    the relatively constant position angle ( 100 @xmath32 ) of the nuclear oval and its inner ellipticity maximum ( 0.28 ) , which is significantly higher than the outer disk s ellipticity ( @xmath13 0.1 ) , strongly suggest the existence of a nuclear stellar bar of radius @xmath3 ( 1.3 kpc ) .",
    "previous nir studies ( pompea & rieke 1990 ; forbes et al .",
    "1992 ) hinted at the existence of this nuclear stellar bar , but it was not as evident because of lower sensitivity and resolution .",
    "as further supporting evidence , we note that for a moderately inclined galaxy like ngc  2782 , the nuclear oval is unlikely to be caused by projection artifacts which may sometimes emulate a bar ( e.g. , friedli et al . 1996 ; jungwiert et al .",
    "in addition , the maximum ellipticity ( 0.28 ) of the nuclear stellar oval is comparable to the mean maximum ellipticity ( 0.31 ) found for the inner cores of other galaxies considered to have nuclear stellar bars ( e.g. , friedli et al .",
    "the presence of a nuclear stellar bar is also consistent with the difference between the pa of the nuclear stellar oval , and the pa of the line of nodes , as estimated from the properties of the starburst - driven outflow .",
    "the rc bubbles and the h@xmath1 bubble associated with the outflow ( paper i , also fig .",
    "3d ) suggest a kinematic minor axis of 165 @xmath32 , and for an outflow perpendicular to the disk , this sets the line of nodes at @xmath2 75 @xmath32 .",
    "the hst i and v - band images ( see @xmath12 4.5 ) , more obscured by dust than the k - band image , also reveal stellar and dust lane morphologies consistent with the existence of a nuclear stellar bar .",
    "while the case for a nuclear stellar bar of radius @xmath3 ( 1.3 kpc ) seems firm , we can not unambiguously determine if the large - scale oval feature which shows a smooth rise in ellipticity from a radius of @xmath25 to @xmath18 ( 4.3 kpc ) is a primary bar . on one hand , the relatively straight and prominent dust lanes ( described above ) associated with the leading edge of the large - scale oval are strongly reminiscent of primary stellar bars . on the other hand",
    ", we note that within the large - scale oval , between radii of @xmath25 to @xmath18 , the pa of the i - band isophotes is not constant , but twists .",
    "a constant position angle would have clinched the case for a primary bar , but isophotal twist neither proves nor excludes the presence of a primary bar . in general , spiral arms , dust lanes , a radius - dependent triaxiality associated with a primary bar or / and a bulge , as well as intrinsically misaligned isophotal surfaces not associated with a primary bar , may all produce isophotal twist ( wozniak et al .",
    "1995 ; jungwiert et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the case of ngc 2782 , we can exclude spiral arms or ripples as the cause of the observed isophotal twist , since such features are not present between radii of @xmath25 to @xmath18 in the k - band or i - band image ( figs .",
    "( the ripples in the i - band image exist only further out , at radii of @xmath2 @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , since dust and other causes of isophotal twist can not be excluded , a firm case can not be made for a primary stellar bar .",
    "in summary , we hence conclude that ngc 2782 harbors a nuclear stellar bar of radius @xmath3 ( 1.3 kpc ) , which is nested within a large - scale oval of radius @xmath18 ( 4.3 kpc ) , which may be , but is not necessarily , a primary bar .      the previously published low resolution ( @xmath6 or 1 kpc ) co ( j=1-@xmath00 )",
    "nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) map ( ishizuki 1994 ) shows an elongated feature with two barely resolved co peaks in the inner @xmath41 ( 1.5 kpc ) radius , and fainter emission further out .",
    "the data gave limited additional information on the distribution and kinematics of the gas in the inner few kpc .",
    "our high resolution ( @xmath30 or @xmath31 pc ) ovro co ( j=1-@xmath00 ) map in fig .",
    "5a shows a bar - like co feature of radius @xmath2  @xmath3 ( 1.3 kpc ) , and resolves it into two extended , clumpy lobes which lie on opposite sides of the nucleus , separated by @xmath2 @xmath6 ( 1 kpc ) . between the two co lobes , in the inner 200 pc radius , the starburst activity peaks sharply ( paper i & @xmath12 4.5 ) .",
    "it is possible that the co depression between the lobes is the result of gas consumption by star formation or / and gas blown out in the starburst - driven wind .",
    "the bar - like co feature has a similar size as the nuclear stellar bar of radius @xmath3 ( 1.3 kpc ) and pa @xmath2 100 @xmath32 identified in @xmath12 4.1 .",
    "the two co lobes lie on the leading edges of this nuclear stellar bar , assuming a clockwise sense of rotation for the stellar bar .",
    "( this sense of rotation for the stars stems from the assumption that they are rotating in the same sense as the molecular gas , for which we infer a clockwise sense of rotation from the kinematics ) .",
    "gas on the leading edges of a stellar bar is expected to lose angular momentum and be driven inwards , as a result of shocks and gravitational torques exerted by the stars on the gas ( e.g. , schwarz 1984 ; combes & gerin 1985 ; athanassoula 1992 ; friedli & martinet 1993 ; byrd et al 1994 ; piner et al .",
    "it is thus possible that the nuclear stellar bar is fuelling gas from the co lobes into the central starburst .",
    "the intensity - weighted co velocity field shown in fig .",
    "5b provides further insight into the circumnuclear dynamics .",
    "no significant sign of warping is seen : there is no conspicuous distortion of the kinematic principal axes into s - shapes over the inner @xmath25 ( 1.4 kpc ) radius , and the pa of the co kinematic minor axis ( kmna ) is consistent with pa ( 165 @xmath32 ) of the minor axis suggested by the starburst - driven rc and h@xmath1 outflow bubbles ( paper i & fig .",
    "3d ) . most of the isovelocity contours in the central @xmath25 ( 1.4 kpc ) radius form a ` spider - diagram ' , suggesting that circular motions are important .",
    "the co velocity field , with redshifted velocities lying to the west of the kinematic center , implies a clockwise sense of rotation for the circumnuclear molecular gas if we assume the near side of the galactic disk lies to the north .",
    "this orientation for the galactic disk was inferred in paper i from the morphology of the starburst - driven outflow and the dust lanes ( see also @xmath12 4.3 ) . the circumnuclear co velocities are consistent with the previously observed kinematics of the cores of hi ( smith 1994 ) and ionised ( boer et al .",
    "1992 ) gas . however , superposed on the predominantly circular velocity field , are non - circular motions in several regions , particularly near the co lobes .",
    "the kinematic major axis ( kmja ) is at @xmath2 75 @xmath32 near the center , but it curves near the eastern and western co lobes .",
    "this suggests bar - like streaming motions in the co lobes .    the co spatial velocity plot along the kmja , shown in fig .",
    "6a , probes the gas kinematics in more detail .",
    "the spatial velocity plot has a width of @xmath42 @xmath43 about the kmna , and the systemic velocity of 2550 km s@xmath7 has been subtracted from the velocities shown on the y - axis . on the eastern side of the major axis , between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , complex kinematics and an apparent gap in the spatial - velocity plot at a velocity of -50 km s@xmath7 are seen .",
    "the features marked as a1 , a2 , a3 , and a4 in fig . 6a",
    "delineate large linewidths at the position of the western and main eastern co peaks .",
    "notice also that the observed velocities increase rapidly between the center and a3 , but the ` rotation curve ' become shallow as it goes through the western co peak",
    ". what is producing the complex kinematics in the co peaks ?",
    "these kinematics may be the manifestation of bar - like azimuthal streaming motions and radial inflow motions which are expected in gas lying on the leading edges of a nuclear stellar bar .",
    "it is difficult to directly identify a radial inflow component in the data because the observed line of sight velocity is in general a combination of several velocity components which can not be easily disentangled from each other : azimuthal in - plane motions , vertical out - of - plane motions , and radial in - plane motions ( eq .",
    "8 - 60 in mihalas & binney 1981 ) . in the case of ngc 2782 ,",
    "spatial velocity cuts which go through the co peaks are close to the kmja , and hence are more sensitive to azimuthal in - plane and vertical out - of - plane motions than to radial in - plane motions .",
    "we also point out that some molecular gas might be outflowing from the starburst region .",
    "the co intensity map in fig . 5a shows two co spurs ( labelled o1 and o2 ) between the co lobes .",
    "the co isovelocity contours in fig .",
    "5b show clear kinks at the base of these spurs , indicating deviations from circular motions .",
    "3d shows that these spurs lie just north and south of the central starburst region , and are elongated along the co kmna ( @xmath45 ) , within the two rc outflow bubbles . in fig .",
    "6b , the spatial - velocity plot along the kmna shows that gas velocities deviate from the systemic velocity ( 2555 km s@xmath7 ) by @xmath2 ( + 30 km s@xmath7 ) in the northern spur , and by @xmath2 ( - 30 km s@xmath7 ) in the southern spur . with the near side of the disk being north ( paper i & @xmath12 4.5 ) ,",
    "these velocities are consistent with vertical out - of - plane motions or radial in - plane motions .",
    "although we can not strictly distinguish between the two possibilities , the location of the spurs with respect to the central starburst and outflow bubbles , and their elongation along the kmna provide circumstantial support for outflowing gas .",
    "we need to estimate the inclination of the circumnuclear molecular gas in order to subsequently constrain properties such as the molecular gas mass fraction and kinematics .",
    "we first note that the co velocity field ( fig .",
    "5b ) does not suggest any significant warping , and therefore it is reasonable to assume that the circumnuclear molecular gas lies in one plane .",
    "we infer that the inclination ( i@xmath46 ) of this plane is @xmath2 30 @xmath32 , from the following arguments : * ( i ) we can rule out an inclination close to edge - on because it would imply that the large thickness of the observed bar - like co distribution corresponds to unrealistically large scale heights ( @xmath2 1 kpc ) for molecular gas _ throughout the region between radii of @xmath47 ( 510 pc ) to @xmath3 ( 1.3 kpc ) .",
    "while one might conceivably justify large scale heights in the central @xmath11 ( 340 pc ) radius where intense starburst activity and winds prevail , it would be difficult to account for such large scale heights out to a radius of 1.3 kpc . *",
    "( ii ) the tully fisher relation for optical blue magnitudes requires i@xmath46 @xmath0 25 @xmath32 in order to ensure that the peak co rotational speed ( 165 km @xmath7/sin @xmath48 ) does not exceed the maximum rotational speed of 400 km s@xmath7 ( rubin et al . 1985 ) observed in peculiar and normal galaxies which are optically as bright or brighter than ngc  2782 .",
    "we can also apply the infrared tully fisher relation between the h magnitude ( m@xmath49 ) and the peak rotational speed ( @xmath50 ) , [ m@xmath49 = 2 - log v@xmath51 ( pierce & tully 1988 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath52 = 10.1 ( de vaucouleurs & longo 1988 ) , and an uncertainty of 0.7 magnitude in the tully fisher relation , we find that @xmath48 is ( @xmath53 ) . *",
    "( iii ) this moderate value of @xmath2 30 @xmath32 we estimated for @xmath48 is consistent with the inclination of dust in the inner few kpc , as constrained by properties of the starburst - driven outflow .",
    "the 5 ghz rc image shows kpc - sized outflow bubbles _ both north and south of the nucleus , while only the southern bubble is visible in the optical h@xmath1 and [ o  iii ] images ( see paper i ) .",
    "this suggests that the northern bubble is obscured by dust in the inner few kpc of a moderately inclined disk whose near side lies to the north ( jogee et al .",

    "what about the nuclear stellar bar ?",
    "simulations show that as a nuclear stellar bar drives gas into the inner few hundred pc , it may be destroyed and even evolve into a triaxial bulge ( e.g. , friedli & martinet 1993 ) . any existing large - scale primary stellar bar may be weakened or completely destroyed ( hasan & norman 1990 ; friedli & benz 1995 ; norman , sellwood , & hasan 1996 ) .",
    "the destruction of the stellar bars is caused by the development of chaotic orbits and an increased mass concentration in the region of x@xmath117 stellar orbits which are perpendicular to the bar .",
    "typically , bar dissolution occurs if the mass concentration in the central 200 pc radius is @xmath118 1 - 2  % of the total stellar mass in the disk . the nuclear stellar bar dissolves over a few rotation periods , typically a few @xmath119 years ( friedli & martinet 1993 ; combes 1994 ) . in ngc  2782 , for a standard co - h@xmath60 conversion factor , the gas mass ( @xmath4 m@xmath5 ) in the co lobes is @xmath2  1  % of the total stellar mass in the optical disk of radius 1 ( 10 kpc ) .",
    "thus , if most of this gas is driven into the inner 200 pc radius , the nuclear stellar bar and the large - scale stellar oval can be rapidly destroyed .",
    "nuclear stellar bars are also expected to be short - lived as a result of the rapid transfer of angular momentum from the bar to the galactic halo via dynamical friction , on timescales of a few rotation periods ( weinberg 1985 ) , or a few @xmath120 years .",
    "simulations have suggested different ways of forming nuclear stellar and gas bars .",
    "some studies have focused on gas - rich systems where the circumnuclear gas mass fraction is between 20 to 50 % ( shlosman et al . 1989 ; heller & shlosman 1994 ) . typically , a circumnuclear gas - rich disk forms , it becomes bar - unstable , and the nuclear gas bar rapidly fragments . however , nuclear stellar bars do not form in these simulations .",
    "this characteristic is consistent with the simulations and analytical work of shlosman & noguchi ( 1993 ) who find that for a disk with a gas mass fraction well above 10  % , the gas becomes clumpy , and dynamical fraction between the gas clumps and the sea of stars heats up the stellar disk over several rotation periods .",
    "this results in a hot stellar disk which is stable against bar instabilities .",
    "more relevant for ngc 2782 might be the simulations of friedli & martinet ( 1993 ) or combes ( 1994 ) , which produce nuclear stellar bars in moderately gas - rich circumnuclear regions .",
    "a nuclear stellar bar which is rotating faster than the large - scale primary stellar bar can form if the mass density contrast between the inner and outer regions of the primary bar is large enough .",
    "molecular gas is critical for the decoupling : it helps to increase the central mass concentration and it loses angular momentum to the nuclear stellar bar , thereby helping it to maintain a large pattern speed .",
    "the molecular gas distribution becomes bar - like and this nuclear gas bar leads the nuclear stellar bar by a small angle , and can make up @xmath2 10  % of the dynamical mass .",
    "ngc  2782 has many properties consistent with these simulations : it hosts a clumpy bar - like co feature whose radius ( 7.5@xmath72 or 1.3 kpc ) is comparable to that of the nuclear stellar bar ; the co peaks lie on the leading edges of the nuclear stellar bar and show weak bar - like streaming motions ; the molecular gas makes up @xmath2 7.5 % of the dynamical mass within a @xmath3 ( 1.3 kpc ) radius for a standard co - h@xmath60 conversion factor",

    "5a ) . if these clumps are self - gravitating entities , then dynamical friction ( @xmath12 4.7.2 ) might be at least as important as gravitational torques in driving the gas towards the center .",
    "simulations by shaw et al .",
    "( 1993 ) also produce a nuclear stellar bar , but it is still coupled to the primary stellar bar . in this scenario , a gas ring near the ilrs is phase - shifted in _ a leading sense with respect to the large - scale primary stellar bar , and the gravitational perturbation of the gas on the stellar orbits produces isophotal twists .",
    "the distorted isophotes can give the appearance of a nuclear stellar bar which _ always leads the primary bar .",
    "this contrasts with the dynamically decoupled nuclear stellar bar and gaseous bar which can lead the primary bar part of the time and _ trail it at other times . in the case of ngc 2782 ,",
    "the nuclear stellar and gas bars are nested in a large - scale stellar oval of radius @xmath18 ( 4.3 kpc ) which could be primary stellar bar ( @xmath12 4.1 ) .",
    "the clumpy nuclear gas bar with a pa between 70 to 85 @xmath32 , trails the large - scale stellar oval whose pa lies between 20 to 30 @xmath32 .",
    "hence , if the large - scale stellar oval is a primary bar , then ngc 2782 supports the scenarios to form decoupled nuclear bars . _ _ _    however , the simulations discussed so far deal with isolated galaxies where a spontaneously - induced primary bar was the main way to drive gas from the outer disk to the inner kpc . in the case of ngc 2782 , which has experienced a recent interaction or merger ( smith 1994 ) ,",
    "such gas inflows can result from the interaction itself , namely direct tidal torques ( hernquist & mihos 1995 ) , as well as gravitational torques from tidally - induced large - scale stellar bars ( noguchi 1988 ; combes et al . 1990 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "once gas reaches the circumnuclear region , the formation of nuclear bars may ensue in a fashion qualitatively similar to the scenarios for isolated galaxies .",
    "another alternative for interacting galaxies is that a nuclear stellar bar may form by the accretion of a rapidly rotating gas - rich companion .",
    "in fact , decoupled nuclear stellar disks / bars are quite common in hst images ( barth et al . 1995 ) , and in spectroscopic studies by rubin at al .",
    "( 1997 ) who find that @xmath2 20  % of a sample of 80 virgo cluster galaxies host a decoupled disk or ring within a 500 pc radius .",
    "we also suggest that ngc 2782 would not harbor a nuclear stellar bar if it had undergone a major merger .",
    "violent relaxation , which operate in major mergers , tends to eradicate non - axisymmetric structures and produce an r@xmath23 stellar surface brightness profile .",
    "the large gas inflow rates and large central gas concentrations typical of major mergers can rapidly destroy primary and nuclear stellar bars , as described in @xmath12 4.7.3 .",
    "the large gas mass fraction also leads to the formation of gas clumps which heat the stellar component via dynamical friction , thereby making it stable against bar formation ( shlosman & noguchi 1993 ) .",
    "for instance , the major merger ngc  7252 has an r@xmath23 k - band profile ( schweizer 1982 ) and the molecular gas mass fraction exceeds 30 @xmath121 in the central kpc .",
    "in contrast , ngc 2782 has a molecular gas mass fraction of @xmath2 8  % in the inner kpc radius .",
    "it has properties inconsistent with a major merger : its optical disk can be fitted with an exponential surface brightness profile , rather than an r@xmath23 profile between radii of @xmath2 @xmath22 to @xmath20 ; its large - scale hi properties have been modeled with an intermediate ( 1:4 ) mass ratio interaction or merger by smith ( 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , our r - band image overlaid on the hi map in fig .",
    "10b shows that to the west , the stellar tail is shorter than the 50 kpc long hi tail , while to the east the opposite is true .",
    "this opposite offset in tails on different sides of a galaxy is not observed in major mergers such as ngc 7552 .",
    "we have presented a study of the peculiar interacting starburst galaxy ngc  2782 ( arp 215 ) based on high resolution ( @xmath11 ) interferometric ovro co ( j=1-@xmath00 ) data , optical bvr and h@xmath1 observations from the wiyn telescope , along with available nir images , a 5 ghz rc map , and archival hst images .",
    "the optical and nir data reveal a nuclear stellar bar of radius @xmath2 @xmath3 ( 1.3 kpc ) nested within a large - scale stellar oval of radius @xmath18 ( 4.3 kpc ) , whose dust lane morphology suggest it might be a large - scale stellar bar .",
    "the co maps show a clumpy , double - peaked bar - like co feature which is offset in a leading sense with respect to the nuclear stellar bar , and has a similar radius ( 1.3 kpc ) .",
    "the co bar contains @xmath4 m@xmath5 of molecular gas , assuming a standard co - h@xmath60 conversion factor and solar metallicity .",
    "the molecular gas makes up @xmath2  8  % of the total dynamical mass within the radius ( 1.3 kpc ) of the nuclear stellar bar . within the co bar , the co emission peaks away from the nucleus , in two clumpy lobes lying on opposite sides of the nucleus , separated by @xmath2 @xmath6 ( 1 kpc ) .",
    "the molecular gas bar is forming stars at a rate of 4 to 8 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 .",
    "most of the star formation is centrally concentrated between the two co lobes , in the inner 200 pc radius where the sfr is 3 to 6 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 .",
    "this intense central activity , comparable to that in the prototpyical starburst m82 , suggests that molecular gas fuel must have been recently present in the inner 200 pc radius .",
    "the two co lobes lie on the leading edges of the nuclear stellar bar where gas is expected to lose angular momentum and flow inwards as a result of gravitational torques . furthermore , while circular motions dominate the co velocity field , the co lobes show weak bar - like streaming motions suggestive of gas inflow .",
    "we estimate semi - analytically the gravitational torque by the nuclear stellar bar on the gas in the lobes , and our results suggest large gas inflow rates ( @xmath122 1 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 ) .    while there is mounting evidence from nir surveys that many galaxies have nuclear stellar bars , the observations presented here are amongst the first ones to catch a nuclear stellar bar ` red - handed ' in the act of feeding molecular gas into an m82-class central starburst .",
    "these observations are consistent with some theories and simulations which suggest that nuclear bars provide a powerful way to drive gas closer to the center to fuel a central starburst / agn . in addition",
    ", we note that several massive clumps ( @xmath8 - @xmath9 m@xmath5 ) are present in the inner 400 pc radius and dynamical friction might produce further gas inflow .",
    "we suggest that as a result of star formation and gas inflow , the central activity , the nuclear gas bar , and perhaps even the nuclear stellar bar , will be very short - lived and likely disappear within @xmath123 years .",
    "the short lifetime suggests that nuclear bars can cause a rapid increase in central mass concentration , trigger intense short - lived central activity , and play an important part in circumnuclear evolution .",
