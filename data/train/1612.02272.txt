    "( [ excit_amp ] ) for the amplitude of a regular mode , we can regard the term @xmath192 as the total ( hence measured ) linewidth  @xcite , where the first term indicates the intrinsic linewidth of the regular mode , while the second represents the decay into the chaotic modes .",
    "that already suggests that @xmath193 increases with @xmath38 .",
    "if the fluctuations ultimately due to the dependence of these quantities on the frequency @xmath3 of the mode can be neglected , say , to a zeroth - order approximation , we should be able to see that trend in the experiment .",
    "since we do not measure @xmath38 directly , we express @xmath194 in terms of @xmath174 , the number of regular modes , which is @xmath195 from  ( [ correct ] ) , assuming that @xmath174 is simply proportional to the probability of excitation of one mode , and thus once again dropping the dependence on @xmath3 .",

    "figure  [ gamvsn ] shows that eq .",
    "( [ gamtot ] ) does qualitatively capture the behavior of the average linewidths of the regular modes , within some errors .",
    "the fitted value for @xmath202 corresponds to an average intrinsic @xmath104 factor of the order of @xmath203 , which is consistent with the values measured in an independent experiment , where the regular modes are excited directly via fiber - taper coupling ( appendix  [ app : fibtap ] ) , and there is virtually no coupling to the chaotic modes ( fig .",

    "we count statistics of chaotic resonances in a deformed optical microcavity by the sole experimental detection of high@xmath204 regular modes , using the coupling between regular and chaotic modes , which occurs via dynamical tunneling .",
    "being a priori unaware of the typical escape time of the chaotic modes that effectively contribute to the excitation of the regular modes , we use the experimental data to validate : @xmath0 an entirely classical model , @xmath1 a rmt - based , purely statistical prediction , which is independent from system - specific properties , and , finally , @xmath2 a semiclassical correction to @xmath1 , which does depend on the lyapunov exponent of the chaotic dynamics , and that is found in the best agreement with the observations .",
    "the estimation of the ehrenfest time of quantum - to - classical correspondence from the experimental parameters plays a key role in framing the time scale of the decay ( or typical linewidth ) of the chaotic states ( resonances ) .",
    "the fastest escape occurs around ehrenfest time , and generally within the average time of transition of the decay of correlations from exponential to algebraic , so that the classical description of the dynamics as fully chaotic seems appropriate .    on the other hand ,",
    "accounting for the long - lived chaotic resonances does not seem to be as straightforward .",
    "specifically , the effects of partial transport barriers , as well as the ` stickiness ' along kam tori and stability islands are relegated to the fitting parameters in the current model .",
