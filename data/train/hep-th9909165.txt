    "according to the paper by nambu and jona - lasinio@xcite or more precisely the goldstone theorem,@xcite if the lagrangian without scalar fields has a continuum global symmetry and if this symmetry is spontaneously broken , then there must appear dynamically generated massless spin-0 partilcles , the so - called nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons , the number of which is determined how the symmetry is broken .",
    "then it is necessary to have effective interations among the ng bosons and elementary particles to study the effects of this symmetry breakdown , either they appear as physical particles with tiny masses or are absorbed by guage fields to make them massive .",
    "quite often these ng bosons acquire tiny masses through quantum corrections and/or soft symmetry breaking to give actual physical effects . in these cases",
    "we really need an effective lagrangian to calculate those physical effects .",
    "there are a couple of examples of effective lagrangians known among the ng bosons and elementary particles .",
    "for instance , there are the original nambu - jona - lasinio model@xcite of four - fermi interactions with spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown in which the ng boson is completely massless , and the axion model@xcite due to breakdown of the peccei - quinn symmetry@xcite in which the axion ( pseudo - ng boson ) acquires a little mass through quantum corrections , etc .",
    "the former case , which is the first paper to stimulate the study of spontaneous symmetry breakdown , we just need to calculate the ordinary feynman rules for elementary fermions as well as would - be ng bosons which are expressed as a chain of fermion loops . in the latter case we must assume and/or guess effective interactions with some unknown coupling constants although some constraints are enforced .",
    "there is another interesting example in which people have calculated physical quantities without an effective action .",
    "when one calculates the pion decay constant , one uses the effective coupling between the pion ( ng boson ) and quarks ( or nucleons ) , which was , utilizing the jackiw - johnson@xcite sum rule , originally derived by pagels and stokar@xcite applying the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identity to the axial vector vertex .",
    "this way of determining the effective coupling , i.e. , direct use of the wt identiy to the vertex , includes ambiguities .",
    "the kyoto group has used the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation to uniquely determine this effective coupling and to calculate it perturbatively.@xcite they calculate the expectation value of an axial vector current sandwitched between vacuum and pion state and relates it with the bs amplitude to obtain the pion decay constant . in these approaches there",
    "do not appear the dynamical ng bosons .",
    "instead pagels and stoker use only the wt identiy , and the kyoto group uses a classical equation for the bs amplitude .",
    "hence it does not seem to be clear how actually the ng boson couples to other elementary and/or dynamical fields as an operator form .",
    "here we propose one approach to construct an effective lagrangian among the ng bosons and elementary fields , i.e. , the auxiliary field method , which was once in fashion to construct various kinds of models out of four - fermi interactions and also to study chiral symmetry breakdown.@xcite with this method one can determine uniquely the coupling of the ng boson with fermions as an operator form .",
    "in this paper to show how powerful this approach is , we start from the simplest example , @xmath0 massless gauge theory without scalar fields to derive the coupling among the dynamically generated ng bosons and fermions , to prove masslessness of the ng boson , and to calculate the decay constant of this ng boson in section [ u1 ] .",
    "then in section [ su3 ] we proceed into @xmath1 color gauge theory with iso - doublet fermions ( up and down quarks ) without scalar fields to do the same thing in section [ u1 ] and to give the pion decay constant .",
    "the final section [ disc ] is devoted to the summary and discussions of our method compared with others .",
    "the lagrangian for massless @xmath0 gauge theory is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a gauge parameter . in this paper",
    "we use minkowski metric except for a few equations . in order to introduce auxiliary fields as dynamical ones",
    ", we first functionally integrate the partition function over gauge fields @xmath5 .",

    "since main purpose of this paper is to present our idea as simple as possible , we have neglected other modes .",
    "next we assume that bilocal fields can be decomposed into local fields with continuum indices as follows , which is essential to the following whole arguments in this paper .",
    "[ phi - pi1 ] @xmath15    where fields with arguments @xmath16 are considered to be classical fields and those with @xmath17 to be quantum ones like in the operator product expansion . also assumed is that @xmath18 is a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath19 .",
    "the vev should depend only on @xmath16 because of translational invariance .",
    "the coordinate @xmath17 is the center of mass system . here",
    "a constant parameter @xmath20 has massive dimension one , @xmath18 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 dimension five , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 dimension one .",
    "the difference between quantum and classical fields can be seen by fourier - transforming fields with arguments @xmath16 into momentum space , in which case , e.g. , @xmath25 can be interpreted as local fields with continuum label of internal momentum .",
    "that is , @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which shows @xmath25 is equivalent to @xmath29 with a continuum label @xmath30 .    the legitimacy of this decomposition eqs .",
    "( [ phi - pi1 ] ) may be supported by the following observation .",
    "the composite field in question is tightly bound due to the strong coupling which causes chiral symmetry breakdown and hence it can be decomposed into two wave functions as the first approximation , one for internal motion and another for total motion . an internal motion can be described in @xmath16 , difference of coordinates of two particles , and the whole motion in @xmath17 , the center of mass system coordinate of two particles .",

    "we would like to put stress upon again the reason why the second term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ wt2 ] ) is added to @xmath94 .",
    "this is because people so far have treated the ng boson as a composite particle of fermions , not an elementary field , and hence the feynman diagram for the vertex shown in fig.3 consisting only of fermions and gauge fields should be included .    on the other hand , in our case",
    "we treat the ng boson as an elementary field although dynamical so that we can directly derive the coupling between fermions and the ng boson .",

    "are expected to be obtained from the kinetic terms of the scalars , which are , however , not present in the effective lagrangian obtained after a couple of manipulations .",
    "therefore either that kinetic terms must be generated by quantum corrections or the correction terms to the noether current should directly be calculated .",
    "what we have done in sect .",
    "[ u1 ] is a calculation of the correction term directly concerned with the chiral symmetry breakdown .",
    "there we have calculated fig.2 and obtained the term proportional to @xmath102 that we need now .",
    "that is , we have required that the diagram should satify @xmath103 which determines @xmath20 in terms of @xmath104 after symmetry breaks down .",
    "namely the feynman diagram corresponding to fig.3 is now given by fig.4 , which gives massless particle ( ng boson ) contribution to the vertex .",
    "this is a multiplication of two diagrams , fig.2 and fig.1 and in between them there is a massless ng boson propagator which gives a @xmath105 pole term .",
