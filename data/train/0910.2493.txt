    "the study of rare @xmath0 decays is a key ingredient to meet two of the main goals of the @xmath0-factories : assessing the validity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) picture of @xmath2-violation  @xcite by precisely measuring the elements of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) , and searching for hints of new physics ( np ) , or otherwise constraining np scenarios , in processes which are suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) . in loop processes , in particular ,",
    "np at some higher energy scale may manifest itself in the low energy effective theory as new couplings , such as those introduced by new very massive virtual particles in the loop  @xcite . in np searches",
    "hadronic uncertainties can play a major role , expecially for branching fraction measurements .",
    "many theoretical uncertainties cancel in ratios of amplitudes , and most np probes are therefore of this kind .    in the following sections we report recent measurements , performed by the babar collaboration , that are relevant to np searches in charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays . in sec .",

    "these measurements are related to the ckm angle @xmath8 , which is experimentally accessible through the interference between the direct decay of the @xmath0 meson to a @xmath2 eigenstate and the decay after @xmath9 mixing .",

    "the dominant contribution is represented by the gluonic penguin .",
    "the electroweak penguin and the color suppressed tree amplitudes are expected to be small in the sm , and the direct @xmath2-violation parameter for @xmath37 decays should be equal to that for @xmath38 decays . the rates and direct @xmath2-violating asymmetries in the @xmath39 system reveal puzzling features , that might be indications of np .",
