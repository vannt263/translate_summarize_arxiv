    "in recent decades systems of indirect excitons have been extensively studied experimentally  @xcite due to the prospects to achieve superfluidity and bose condensation .",
    "promising setups which have been successful in controlling the many - exciton state are electron - hole bilayers , e.g.  @xcite or single quantum wells using the quantum stark confinement ( qsc ) .",
    "the latter will be studied in the present work . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite trough the qsc one can simultaneously produce spatially indirect excitons and achieve their spatial localization . by varying the applied electric field one can control the exciton coupling parameter  the ratio of the mutual exciton - exciton interaction to the confinement energy , as shown in our previous simulations for gaas and znse structures  @xcite . with the increasing of inter - exciton coupling a striking phenomenon is expected  spatial ordering of excitons into a crystalline lattice .",
    "this quantum phase transition has been recently studied by a path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) method for _ trapped finite _ coulomb systems @xcite , systems of particles with dipole interaction  @xcite and for the symmetric electron - hole bilayers  @xcite .    in the case of interacting bose particles , in addition ,",
    "( partial ) superfluidity is expected .",
    "then during the crystallization transition one expects a gradual decrease of the superfluid fraction .",
    "this behaviour has recently been studied in detail by pimc simulations for the bose particles with the coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the superfluid density can be concentrated either in the core or at the cluster boundary depending on the hexagonal order in the clusters which sensitively depends on the particle number .",
    "furthermore , a two - dimensional _ homogeneous _ dipole system of up to @xmath0 particles has recently been studied  @xcite .",
    "the authors found a melting point at a density of @xmath1 or @xmath2 , for the definitions see eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) , and a step - like vanishing of the superfluid fraction at this point . in the present paper",
    "we test the validity of the dipole model for indirect excitons .",
    "in fact the effective exciton - exciton interaction @xmath3 is a quantum - mechanical four - body problem which has been studied e.g. by zimmermann @xcite and may significantly deviate from a simple dipole form at distances comparable with the exciton dipole length .",
    "we therefore , devote special care to compute @xmath3 from first principle pimc simulations .",
    "we find that this interaction allows for a second phase transition ",
    "quantum melting of the exciton crystal by compression  missing in dipole systems .",
    "further , we found that for an effective exciton dipole length below @xmath4 the crystalline phase vanishes .",
    "below we present results for a model similar to the experimental setup of the timofeev group  @xcite : a single znse - based qw with indirect excitons produced by an electric field  @xcite applied normal to a qw plane . in order to be able to perform simulations for a macroscopic ensemble of indirect excitons",
    "we apply a bosonic model .",
    "as shown by various groups  @xcite , in the moderate density regime the excitons are adequately treated as a composite particles obeying bose statistics due to strong attractive interaction between electrons and holes . in the simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite we were able to test this approximation against the exact two - component fermion system in a broad range of densities .",
    "in particular , we found that the bosonic model gives accurate predictions for the superfluid fraction once the excitons are in a strongly coupled  low / moderate density regime .",
    "in contrast , in the weakly coupled ",
    "high density regime close to or beyond the mott density , the results are strongly affected by the fermi statistics , and the bosonic approximation is no more valid .",
    "thus , in the present analysis of moderate - density systems the bosonic model works well allowing us to study relatively large exciton ensembles without being hampered by the _ fermion sign _ problem .",
    "the general hamiltonian for the system of @xmath5 electrons and @xmath6 holes ( @xmath7 ) in the quantum well confinement and e - field can be written as @xmath8 with the _ single _ particle and _ interaction _ parts defined as @xmath9 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hat h_z^{single}=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n } \\left [ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^{\\perp}_{e(h)}}\\nabla_{z_i}^2   + v^{qw}_{e(h)}(z_i)+v^{f}_{e(h)}\\{e_z({\\bf r}_i , z_i)\\ }    \\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ & & w=\\sum\\limits_{i < j}^{n } v^{coul}_{ij } , \\quad v^{coul}_{ij}= \\frac{e_i e_j}{\\epsilon } \\left[(\\mathbf r_i-\\mathbf r_j)^2+(z_i - z_j)^2\\right]^{-1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider a homogeneous electric field @xmath10 , vectors @xmath11 denote 2d vectors in the qw plane , @xmath12 is the qw confinement , @xmath13 is the electrostatic potential energy due to the electric field and @xmath14 is the background dielectric constant .    to apply the approximation of bosonic excitons valid for low to moderate densities  @xcite , we want to reduce the 3d hamiltonian  ( [ h1 ] ) to a 2d one , where all effects related to a particular width of the qw and the electric field strength will be combined in an effective inter - exciton interaction @xmath15 .",
    "this becomes possible by using the adiabatic approximation  @xcite .",
    "this approach is justified for high values of the electric field @xmath16 which leads to a strong localization of electrons and holes at opposite edges of the qw . to be specific , the calculations below correspond to @xmath17 nm wide znse qws and @xmath18kv .",
    "assuming the relation of energy scales , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the characteristic spacing of the quantized one - particle energy levels in @xmath21-direction und @xmath22 the interaction energy , we separate the out - of - plane motion and solve the 3d bloch equation for the @xmath23-particle density matrix @xmath24 @xmath25 in the adiabatic approximation , i.e. @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( below we drop the argument @xmath28 ) . now integrating out in eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) all @xmath21-dependencies , i.e. applying @xmath29 , we obtain a reduced @xmath30 bloch equation @xmath31 where we introduced a smoothened coulomb potential @xmath32 the densities @xmath33 and @xmath34 are found by solving a single - exciton problem in an electric field  @xcite .",
    "also the exciton dipole moment , @xmath35 , follows directly from the electron and hole densities @xmath36 the considered here low to moderate density regime leads also to another relation of energy scales , i.e. @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the exciton binding energy . under these conditions",
    "the excitons remain in their internal quantum states described by a two - body density matrix @xmath39 throughout their interaction .",
    "this pair density matrix depends on the electron - hole separation @xmath40 and can be obtained numerically , e.g. with the matrix - squaring technique  @xcite applied to the interaction potential  ( [ smoothv ] ) . using again the adiabatic approximation ( now in the 2d plane ) we write @xmath41 as a product of a density matrix of an @xmath42 particle complex and relative density matrices @xmath43 of @xmath42 excitons",
    "@xmath44 here we have assumed electrical neutrality , @xmath45 , and introduced the electron - hole pair coordinates related to the same exciton , @xmath46 , with the center of mass ( c.o.m . ) coordinates @xmath47 .",
    "certainly , the ansatz ( [ exch ] ) implies that the excitons are stable against external perturbations and we are below the mott density .    now averaging eq .",
    "( [ bloch2 ] ) over the relative degrees of freedom of excitons , i.e. integrating over @xmath48 , we obtain the @xmath42-exciton bloch equation depending on the c.o.m .",
    "coordinates @xmath49 the interaction term in the _ effective exciton _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath50 is defined as the sum of the effective ( adiabatically averaged ) interactions of two electrons and two holes in excitons @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) @xmath54 the distances of two particles from different excitons can be expressed as @xmath55 after integration , in eq .",
    "( [ trueu ] ) remains only the c.o.m .",
    "dependence on @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we have derived the effective hamiltonian  ( [ comph ] ) of composite particles .",
    "the interaction potential  ( [ trueu ] ) generalizes the dipole potential used in the previous analysis of spatially indirect excitons  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of both is discussed below .",
    "the corresponding @xmath23-body problem  ( [ comph ] ) can be solved with the path integral monte carlo technique which allows for a direct treatment of many - body correlation and bosonic exchange effects , for details see  @xcite .",
    "we have performed pimc simulations for a 2d homogeneous system with @xmath57 and @xmath58 bosonic excitons in a simulation box with periodic boundary conditions . the potential  ( [ trueu ] )",
    "has been divided into a short and long - range part , @xmath59 , with the dipole interaction , @xmath60 , treated by the usual ewald summation technique .",

    "the anisotropy of the parabolic bands both for electrons and holes , i.e. the out - of - plane effective masses , @xmath73 , are involved in the exciton solution in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "these masses determine the shape of the density matrices @xmath33 , @xmath34 and hence indirectly influence the effective inter - exciton interaction via eq .",

    "this shows that in znse qw the excitons are more strongly coupled and it is easy to reach a crystalline regime as discussed below .",
    "other advantages of using materials with larger effective masses are : a ) increased stability of excitons due to higher binding energies and b ) increased exciton life - time due to a better separation of carriers in the @xmath21-direction [ the radiative life - time depends on the overlap of the density matrices @xmath81 . in the following we , therefore , concentrate on the znse structure .",
    "however , the results presented in the dimensionless units , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , using table  [ tab1 ] can be applied to other materials as well . in particular",
    ", the effective potential @xmath3  ( [ trueu ] ) already reduces to a dipole interaction @xmath60 at distances of about several exciton dipole moments @xmath84 . in this case the hamiltonian  ( [ comph ] ) can be brought to a universal dimensionless form using the scale  @xcite : @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",

    "further , as one might expect from the dipole model , overall the interaction is stronger with increasing @xmath84 .",
    "however , at small distances , @xmath97 , @xmath3 shows the opposite behavior which originates from the smoothening procedure  ( [ trueu ] ) over the exciton relative density matrices : with increase of @xmath98 e - h pairs become more weakly bound , and the exciton in - plane size increases .",
    "this delocalization reduces the strength of the coulomb interaction between two electrons and two holes , i.e. between two excitons . vice versa , the stronger the binding of an e - h pair and its spatial localization the faster @xmath3 approaches @xmath99 .",
