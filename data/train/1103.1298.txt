    "more than 20 years ago , theoretical studies of atomic hydrogen in ultraintense , high - frequency laser fields produced an unexpected result  @xcite : when increasing the intensity of the laser pulse to such a degree that the applied forces dominate over the coulomb attraction between the nucleus and the electron , the ionization probability does not increase accordingly , but rather stabilize , or start subsiding .",
    "this counterintuitive phenomenon was dubbed atomic stabilization , and was subject to much research in the following decade .",
    "the discussions , controversies and conclusions are available in a number of review articles , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "it has also been pointed out that atomic stabilization has a classical counterpart  @xcite .",
    "( see also  @xcite and references therein . )    at the start of the nineties , the laser technology required to experimentally observe the stabilization effect in tightly bound systems was not available .",
    "for example , in order to measure stabilization in atomic hydrogen , photon energies exceeding @xmath0 ev , the binding energy of the atom , and intensities on the order of @xmath1 w/@xmath2 or more are required  @xcite .",
    "grobe and eberly  @xcite demonstrated that stabilization could occur in h@xmath3 at moderate intensities ( @xmath4 w/@xmath2 ) and photon energies ( @xmath5 ev ) , and wei _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested an experiment , in which a laser , of realistic frequency and intensity , could possibly stabilize the unstable he@xmath3 ion .",
    "however , at present , the only experimental confirmations of stabilization are from studies of low - lying rydberg states  @xcite . with recent advances in free - electron laser ( fel ) technology , extremely high peak intensities have been achieved , with wavelengths ranging from vacuum ultraviolet to soft x - rays  @xcite , and even higher intensities are expected to be delivered in the near future  @xcite .",
    "thus , laser technology is approaching the regime needed for observing atomic stabilization in ground state ( neutral ) atomic systems .",
    "although atomic stabilization has been studied extensively during the last two decades , studies of stabilization in systems containing two electrons are still scarce  @xcite and most often assessed with simplified physical models of reduced dimensionality  @xcite . including a second electron adds a new dimension to the problem , manifested through the electron - electron repulsion .",
    "the studies mentioned above revealed that the electron - electron interaction suppresses atomic stabilization in two - electron systems . although _ ab initio _ calculations of helium have previously been performed at fairly high intensities in the xuv regime  @xcite , only recently was such endeavors extended into the stabilization regime  @xcite , confirming the detrimental effect of the electron - electron interaction on stabilization .",
    "however , it was shown that the effect is markedly less than predicted in models of reduced dimensionality .    in this work",
    ", we revisit the problem of multiphoton ionization of helium in superintense high - frequency fields . in continuation of the work of birkeland _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite we look more closely into the strong - field ionization dynamics of the atom , with particular emphasis on atomic stabilization , considering laser pulses of various central frequencies and durations . a comparison of the ionization yields obtained from the _ ab initio _ calculations , including correlation , with corresponding results obtained from an independent - electron model reveals that the validity of the latter breaks down at strong fields .",
    "an analysis of the system equations in the so - called kramers - henneberger frame  @xcite shows that the electron - electron interaction plays a decisive role in this limit .",
    "we further show that this is manifested in the energy and angular distributions of the ejected electrons .",
    "atomic units , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are scaled to unity , are used throughout unless stated otherwise .",
    "we obtain the ionization probability of ground state helium in extreme laser fields from first principles , i.e. , by solving ( numerically ) the full time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . formulating the problem in the velocity gauge",
    ", the hamiltonian assumes the form @xmath9 a sine - squared carrier envelope was chosen for the laser interaction ,",
    "@xmath10 here @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the amplitude of the electric field , @xmath13 is the laser frequency , and @xmath14 is the total pulse duration . the semiclassical treatment of the field is a valid approach due to the enormous photon flux of superintense lasers .",
    "the pulse fulfills the constraint of a physical pulse  @xcite , @xmath15 propagation and analysis of the wavefunction is performed with the pyprop framework  @xcite , a python / c++ software package for solving the tdse .",
    "the wavefunction is expanded in a @xmath16-spline basis  @xcite for each of the radial components , and a coupled spherical harmonic basis for the angular components , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a combined index for the angular indices .",
    "the coupled spherical harmonic basis functions , @xmath19 are obtained by linearly combining products of ordinary spherical harmonics , weighted by clebsch - gordan coefficients  @xcite .    as the @xmath16-spline basis functions are not orthogonal , an overlap matrix @xmath20 is introduced for each electronic coordinate . from these",
    "the total overlap matrix is found for every angular momentum component by taking the kronecker product @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the identity matrix and @xmath23 is the angular index .",
    "the resulting tdse may then be written as @xmath24 on matrix form .",
    "we solve the tdse using a scheme based on the first - order approximation to the matrix exponential @xmath25 a direct application of this formula is not desirable due to numerical instabilities .",
    "instead , we combine one half - step forward in time , @xmath26 with one half - step backward in time , @xmath27 to obtain the unconditionally stable cayley - hamilton form of the time propagator , @xmath28 this linear system of equations is too large to be solved directly , hence we use an iterative method .",
    "since the matrix @xmath29 is not hermitian , our choice is the generalized minimum residual method ( gmres ) , a krylov subspace method which combines arnoldi iterations with a least - squares problem in the projected space  @xcite . in the gmres algorithm",
    "the error in the least - squares residuals is controlled by the dimension of the krylov subspace , which can be increased until the desired precision is obtained .      in this work",
    "we compute the ionization probability resolved in direction and energy .",
    "we also do a series of smaller simulations , calculating only the total ionization probabilities . separating the single and double ionization",
    "is achieved by projection onto double continuum states . in order to obtain these continuum states exactly one needs to solve a scattering problem for the full two - particle system . as this is computationally cumbersome ,",
    "an approximation using single - particle states is adopted instead .",
    "it can be described as follows . in the case of double ionization ,",
    "when both electrons are far from the nucleus , a product of continuum he@xmath30 @xmath31 states is used . for single ionization , when one electron is close to the nucleus and the other far away a product of bound he@xmath30 and continuum h @xmath32 is used  @xcite .",
    "the single - electron states are not orthogonal to the bound states of the two - electron system , which may become populated during the action of the pulse .",
    "therefore , the projection of the final wavefunction on the doubly bound states are removed before further analysis is conducted . moreover , as the electron - electron correlation is neglected in the double continuum states , the system must be propagated after the pulse for all quantities to converge  @xcite .    on the other hand , when only calculating the total ionization , a small radial box is sufficient .",
    "it is no longer necessary to propagate the system after the pulse , in order to minimize the interaction term , nor to project onto continuum he@xmath30 states .",
    "an absorbing potential is applied at the box boundary in order to absorb the emitted electrons and to minimize reflection . when coupled with an absorbing potential",
    ", we find that only about a third of the radius needed to resolve the differential probabilities is necessary .",
    "the total ionization probability is simply the complement of the probability of being in one of the bound states .    to find the bound states , we use the implicitly restarted arnoldi method  @xcite",
    "this is a version of the arnoldi method for finding eigenpairs that refines the krylov subspace basis in order to find the wanted eigenvectors and eigenvalues . as the arnoldi method tends to find the largest eigenvalues , we also use shifted inverse iterations , which let us find the eigenvalues near a given value .",
    "further details on the discretization , the time integration , and the analysis were presented in a recent communication  @xcite .      in order to gauge the importance of the electron - electron interaction , we repeat the calculations using an independent - electron ( ie ) model  @xcite .",
    "the total wavefunction is approximated as a product of two single - electron wavefunctions @xmath33 the subscript sae refers to the single - active electron approximation .",
    "this is a common approximation for many - electron problems , which focuses on one electron at the time .",
    "any dependence on the rest of the electrons is included in a common potential that is constant with regards to the other electron positions . to find the first electron wavefunction @xmath34",
    ", we apply a pseudo potential , which includes the shielding of the nucleus caused by the other electron  @xcite , @xmath35 for helium the effective charge @xmath36 and the coefficients @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 were adopted . the other electron moves in a he@xmath30 potential , and it is therefore an accurate model for the singly ionized atom .",
    "the ie model reproduces the correct ground state energies and single and double ionization thresholds , and decently represents the excited states .",
    "as the name of the model suggests , the electrons do not interact with each other , beyond what is included in the shielded nuclear potential .",
    "that makes this a three - dimensional , rather than a six - dimensional problem , and it can be calculated with relative ease on an ordinary computer . as a consequence of working with independent particles , the total ( single @xmath43 double )",
    "ionization probability becomes @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the probability of the sae and the he@xmath30 electron , respectively , being in a bound state .",
    "the probability for double ionization is obtained from the product @xmath47 and the single ionization probability is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the ionization probabilities of the sae and the he@xmath30 electrons .",
    "when doing the largest calculations , the radial domain typically extends to @xmath51{a.u.}$ ] , although the double of this was employed to test the convergence . a 5th order _ b_-spline basis of 185 splines is used , distributed exponentially near the nucleus , and linearly further away . up to 300 splines were used for convergence test purposes . regarding the angular basis of coupled spherical harmonics , @xmath52 and @xmath53",

    "this scaling allows us to easily compare the results obtained with different laser frequencies .",
    "in most of the considered cases , the ionization probability increases with @xmath63 up to some point , where it attains a maximum before it starts to decline , i.e. , we are entering the so - called stabilization regime . when stabilization occurs , the ionization peak ( corresponding to the death valley  @xcite ) is typically situated between @xmath72 and @xmath73{a.u.}$ ] , independent of laser frequency and pulse duration . for very short pulse durations ,",
    "e.g. the 3-cycle pulse of @xmath74{a.u.}$ ] , we observe a knee in the function , rather than a peak at the stabilization point .",
    "this is probably due to the relatively large bandwidth of these short pulses and the averaging this leads to . for long pulse durations , e.g. the 24-cycle pulse of @xmath75{a.u.}$ ] ,",

    "the corresponding results of the ie model are shown in dashed lines .",
    "one immediately perceives that for higher frequencies , the atom stabilizes at lower ionization probabilities , in accordance with the results in fig .",
    "note that in the limit of weak fields single ionization is by far the dominating ionization channel .",
    "thus , from first order perturbation theory @xmath80 .",
    "now , since the pulse duration is kept fixed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( as opposed to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , this explains why the results of the calculations with different frequencies almost coincide at smaller fields .",
    "the figure also demonstrates the fact that the discrepancy between the ie model ( dashed lines ) and the full calculations ( solid lines ) increases with the intensity .",
    "furthermore , the stabilizing effect turns out to be very weak in the fully correlated system . whereas the full _ ab initio _ calculations give ionization probabilities that level off ( low frequencies ) or increase ( high frequencies ) for high intensities , the ie model returns probabilities that are noticably lower . as the intensity grows , so do the discrepancy .",
    "as such , the simplified model tends to always underestimate the ionization probability , with the consequence that the stabilization effect is overestimated .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] clearly demonstrate that the validity of the independent - electron model  ( [ eq2_2 ] ) breaks down in the superintense field regime .",
    "this may appear counterintuitive , as one might well expect the opposite to happen , i.e. , that the importance of the electron - electron interaction should be negligible in the presence of a strong external perturbation .",
    "the reason why the electron - electron interaction in fact becomes more important in this limit can be understood by analyzing the dynamics in the so - called kramers - henneberger ( kh ) frame  @xcite , the rest frame of a classical free electron in the laser field . in this frame the hamiltonian , eq .",

    "@xcite showed that the @xmath87 component in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) plays an increasingly important role in the dynamics at higher value of @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of superintense fields ( @xmath88 ) , frre _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the ionization dynamics of atomic hydrogen is mainly dictated by the @xmath89 potential .",
    "thus , in this limit , the dynamics of the system is approximately given by the effective hamiltonian @xmath90 note that this hamiltonian is time - independent and accounts for _ shake - up _",
    "( excitation ) and _ shake - off _ ( ionization ) in the strong field limit .",
    "an analysis of the properties of the @xmath89 potential term in the vicinity of the origin reveals that it can be neglected relative to the electron - electron repulsion term in the limit @xmath91 , provided the two - electron wave function is localized , i.e. , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this means that the dynamics of the two - electron system , in the limit of superintense fields and for sufficiently short pulses , ultimately reduces to that of a pure coulomb explosion process effectuated by the coulomb repulsion term in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) . from this",
    "we conclude that the electron - electron interaction is in fact very important in the strong field limit , effectively reducing the stabilization effect .",
    "returning to the laboratory frame of reference this should be understood in the following way : in the very strong field limit , the electrons effectively behave like free particles in the field , moving side by side with respect to the field axis .",
    "as this happens , the nuclear attraction may become less important than the mutual repulsion between the electrons , and the ionization is most likely initiated by electron - electron scattering events ( coulomb explosion ) and not electron - nucleus collisions .",
    "this explains qualitatively why the ionization probabilities , calculated within the independent - electron model , deviate increasingly from the exact ones in the limit of stronger fields ( c.f .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] ) . as such ,",
    "the observed deviation is indeed a manifestation of the breakdown of the single - particle picture in superstrong fields .",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the probability of excitation of helium for the cases considered in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] we observe that the decreasing ionization probability in the stabilization regime is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the excitation probability .",
    "note that due to the high photon energy , excitation is here caused by shake - up processes , merely demonstrating the importance of the @xmath89 potential in the stabilization regime .",
    "the figure also clearly expresses the fact that shake - up is more important for the higher frequencies and that the ie model fails in describing shake - up ( and shake - off ) processes accurately , in accordance with the kh discussion above .",
    "further insight into the strong - field behavior of helium may be gained by examining the energy distribution of the ejected electrons .",
