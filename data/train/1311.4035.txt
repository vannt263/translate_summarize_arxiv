    "sensation and motion are represented and processed in the brain as series of neuronal discharges called firings or spikes  @xcite . in the early 1900s ,",
    "the number of neuronal discharges in a given time interval was found to be related to the tension in the associated muscle  @xcite . since then , correlating the rate of neuronal firings with animal behavior has become standard protocol .",
    "other coding hypotheses have also been studied both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite . among these alternatives",
    "is temporal coding , which emphasizes the importance of precise spike timings  @xcite .",
    "coding hypotheses have retained researchers interest , less for unproductive taxonomy purposes , but because they assist our understanding of neuronal information processing in the brain . theoretically , it has been demonstrated that a discrete ( as opposed to continuous ) firing rate increases the rate of information transmission , depending on the width of the time window  @xcite .",
    "thus , assuming that neural systems have evolved to maximize their information transmission rate , different areas of the brain may process signals in different ways .",
    "the coding problem has become the subject of theoretical modeling .",
    "for instance , in attractor network theory , neuronal activity undergoes transitions among quasistationary states  @xcite .",
    "attractor states may manifest as distinct changes in the firing condition .",
    "information processing can feasibly be represented by jumping among quasi - stationary states . in particular",
    ", the change - point detection of neurons approaches the theoretical optimum  @xcite .",
    "of more practical interest , coding identification may lead to improved information decoding , which would benefit real - time applications such as brain machine interfaces .",
    "nevertheless , rate coding and temporal coding are not clearly delineated because they are not mutually exclusive .",
    "for instance , spike timing may be reinterpreted as high firing rate in a small time window . a clearer distinction between the coding types",
    "has been suggested , such that any spike train is classifiable into rate or temporal coding , depending on whether the underlying rate varies slowly or rapidly with time , respectively  @xcite .",
    "however , this principle is not directly applicable to data , because the firing rate can not be uniquely determined from a single spike train .",
    "rather , spiking is generally irregular and sparse , and the underlying rate can be obtained only from multiple spike train analyses in repeated trials .",
    "the fine details of original rate fluctuations are easily erased by inter - trial jittering  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the coding hypothesis should be identified on a single trial basis .            here , we suggest a method that selects a unique hypothesis for any given single spike train .",
    "the conventional timing - based classification is replaced by an analog  digital classification criterion that inquires whether the spike train is likely transmitting a continuously varying analog signal or discontinuously switching binary signals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : workflow ] ) .",
    "the proposed classification scheme is similar to the timing - based scheme because analog and digital signals may be represented by the firing rate and timing of spike bursts , respectively .",
    "thus , rather than dispense with the rate - coding hypothesis , we select the best interpretation of a single spike train from alternative rate estimators based on rivalry principles .",
    "specifically , we select a single stochastic model , either the empirical bayes model ( ebm ) or the hidden markov model ( hmm ) , by comparing their likelihood estimates for a given spike train . the ebm and hmm represent the analog and digital codes , respectively .",
    "the effectiveness of the inference method is tested on synthetic data derived from inhomogeneous poisson processes whose continuous and discrete rates are given by the ornstein  uhlenbeck process ( oup ) and the switching state process ( ssp ) , respectively . finally , to determine whether different areas of the brain encode signals continuously or discretely , the suggested analysis is applied to biological data .",
    "to examine how efficiently the rate estimators infer the underlying rate , we first consider the idealized inhomogeneous poisson processes , in which spikes are randomly drawn from a given rate function of time .",
    "oup and ssp represent rate functions that fluctuate continuously and discontinuously in time , respectively .    *",
    "the ornstein  uhlenbeck process ( oup ) : * a typical continuously fluctuating process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample](a ) .",
    "we represent this process by the oup , originally introduced to describe the fluctuating velocities of brownian particles .",
    "oup is modeled by the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gaussian white noise characterized by the ensemble average @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "due to random fluctuations in the oup , @xmath4 can be negative even if @xmath5 exceeds the typical fluctuation amplitude @xmath6 . interpreting @xmath4 as the temporally fluctuating rate ,",
    "the firing rate is regarded as zero if @xmath7 .    * switching state process ( ssp ) : * a typical discontinuously fluctuating process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample](b ) . for this process",
    ", we adopt random telegraph state switching , in which the on / off states stochastically alternate under the random telegraph process .",
    "here we consider a symmetric case in which the average inter - transition interval is the same for both states .",
    "this process can be realized by repeating the bernoulli trials for making a transition to another state with the rate @xmath8 ; equivalently , by drawing inter - transition intervals from the exponential distribution with mean @xmath9 , @xmath10 . for two states we assign the firing rates @xmath11 or @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "* 1st and 2nd order statistics : * the sample rate processes generated by the oup and ssp are apparently different ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] ) .",
    "however , given the same parameter set , @xmath14 , both processes deliver identical first and second order statistics , ( mean and correlation function of the rate , respectively ) , given by    @xmath15    where the overline represents the time - average and @xmath16 .",

    "here we introduce ebm and hmm as stochastic models of continuous and discontinuous rate processes , respectively .",

    "here we adopt a two - state hmm model , in which the rate takes one of two values .",
    "model parameters are the two rates @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the elements of the transition matrix , and the probabilities of the initial states .",
    "these parameters are estimated by the baum  welch algorithm , and then the most likely sequence of hidden states is then obtained from the viterbi algorithm . the estimated rate @xmath28 is regarded as the sequence of alternating rates assigned as the selected hidden states .",
    "an application program for performing hmm rate estimation is accessible by ref .",
    "in this section , we compare the accuracy of ebm and hmm in estimating the underlying rates from oup- and ssp - derived spike trains , representing continuous and discontinuous rate processes , respectively .      apparently the firing rate of the spike train derived from oup is better estimated by ebm than by hmm , while the opposite is true for the ssp - derived spike train ( fig .",

    "fractions of neurons exhibiting analog and digital coding patterns differ between the three brain regions .",
    "in particular , more discontinuous firing patterns were observed in lgn neurons than in v1 and mt neurons ( 15/49 in the lgn , versus 3/39 and 7/40 in the v1 and mt , respectively ) .",
    "several spike trains , together with their rates estimated by continuous ebm and discontinuous hmm rate estimators , are presented in fig .",

    "in this paper , we selected alternative coding hypotheses for individual spike trains .",
    "for this purpose , we compared rate estimators of the continuous ebm and discontinuous hmm , respectively representing analog and digital neuronal codes .",
    "we first determined whether the class of rate process could be identified from synthetic spike trains derived from oup and ssp .",
    "next , we applied our analytical method to biological data obtained from the visual cortical areas v1 and mt , and the thalamus lgn , and found significant differences among the firing patterns of different brain areas .",
    "here we assumed two hypotheses ; that information transmitted by neurons is coded in an analog or digital manner .",
    "if the purpose of selecting coding hypotheses is to best estimate the unknown underlying rate , more coding hypotheses can be accommodated by adopting a suitable model selection principle .",
    "for instance , we suggested that two - state hmm represents discontinuous rate processes , but numerous variants are possible .",
    "for example , the number of states can exceed two ; the number of firing rates is not necessarily fixed in advance but may change arbitrarily in every switching ; the firing rate may fluctuate during the inter - transition interval .",
    "such possibilities could be examined using multistate hmms , the infinite hmm  @xcite and the switching state - space model  @xcite .    throughout this study , we have assumed the inhomogeneous poisson process , in which individual spikes are independently derived from a given rate function of time .",
    "however , it should be noted that spiking events are significantly influenced by their predecessors .",
    "consequently , real neuronal firings are not precisely modeled by poisson processes  @xcite .",
    "thus , one may extend our analysis to contend with deviation from poisson firing , as has been done in refs  @xcite .    nevertheless , assuming the simple poisson process is suitable for diverse problems due to its general applicability .",
    "in random point processes such as earthquakes , machine noises , and human communications , it would be worthwhile to examine whether the underlying condition is better interpreted as active / inactive , or continuously fluctuating .",

    "<S> it has long been debated whether information in the brain is coded at the rate of neuronal spiking or at the precise timing of single spikes . </S>",
    "<S> although this issue is essential to the understanding of neural signal processing , it is not easily resolved because the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest revising this coding issue so that one hypothesis is uniquely selected for a given spike train . to this end , we decide whether the spike train is likely to transmit a continuously varying analog signal or switching between active and inactive states . </S>",
    "<S> the coding hypothesis is selected by comparing the likelihood estimates yielded by empirical bayes and hidden markov models on individual data . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis method is applicable to generic event sequences , such as earthquakes , machine noises , human communications , and enhances the gain in decoding signals and infers underlying activities . </S>"
