    "the origin of ferromagnetism in itinerant systems remains one of the open questions in the condensed matter theory .",
    "even though spin - density functional theory gives correctly several predictions concerning the stability of ferromagnetism,@xcite it is interesting to develop simple models which point out the important physical parameters governing the ferromagnetic instabilities .",
    "ferromagnetism may occur in two ways : either the paramagnetic ( pm ) state gets unstable against the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state for particular values of parameters ( so - called stoner instability ) , or the strongly polarized fm state , in most cases saturated ferromagnetic ( sf ) state , has the lowest energy beyond some values of electron - electron interactions , but the pm state is still locally stable in a range of parameters .",
    "it is certainly instructive to understand first the possible mechanisms of ferromagnetism in the case of a narrow @xmath0 band studied in the tight - binding model using the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) .",
    "when only the on - site matrix element u of the coulomb interaction are taken into account the stoner instability occurs when @xmath3 satisfies the well known stoner criterion @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the density of states at the fermi level per spin , and the majority and minority spin bands are rigidly shifted relative to each other .",
    "the influence of the two - site matrix elements of the coulomb interaction has been thoroughly studied in the pioneering work by hirsch _",
    "already over a decade ago.@xcite these ideas were further developed and qualitatively new effects were found , both within the hfa , and by going beyond it.@xcite in particular , hirsch _",
    "et al._@xcite have pointed out that the renormalization of the hopping integrals resulting from the hartree - fock decoupling of the two - body inter - site term of the hamiltonian plays a role in the occurrence of ferromagnetism by changing the bandwidths of majority and minority spin bands in a different way , thus modifying the stoner condition .",
    "however , hirsch _",
    "et al._@xcite have mainly emphasized the effect of exchange integrals and have only considered a constant density of states or that of a linear chain .",
    "indeed , the non - degenerate model with exchange interactions was proposed to provide explanation of certain itinerant systems , such as eub@xmath6.@xcite obviously , the conclusions that can be drawn from such a model depend critically on the numerical values of the parameters and we expect the classical charge - charge inter - site coulomb interaction @xmath7 to be larger than the exchange one.@xcite consequently , we have found interesting to revisit this model by considering more realistic relative values of the coulomb matrix elements first in the case of a constant density of states , then for the densities of states of real cubic lattices .",
    "we will see that in this last case the physics of fm instabilities is significantly modified .",
    "therefore a quantitative study of the influence of inter - site coulomb interactions in fm transition metals needs an accurate description of the density of states and realistic interaction parameters .",
    "however ferromagnetism is found usually in systems with degenerate orbitals and since the early work of hubbard@xcite a variety of theoretical attempts have been undertaken to understand to what extent the orbital degeneracy might play an essential role in particular in the ferromagnetism of fe , co and ni .",
    "the dominating point of view at present is that the degeneracy of @xmath8 orbitals is crucial,@xcite since local moments can form @xcite and survive above the curie temperature due to intra - atomic exchange integrals . here",
    "we will investigate the effect of on - site and inter - site interactions in degenerate @xmath1 bands , considering realistic parameters .",
    "it is clear that the most important matrix elements of the coulomb interaction involved in fm instabilities contain four @xmath8 orbitals centered on at most two neighboring sites .",
    "the relative values of the matrix elements can be inferred from the results of explicit calculations using atomic wave functions . from these calculations@xcite",
    "it turns out that the largest on - site matrix elements are those introduced already in our previous paper,@xcite while the only non negligible inter - site coulomb interactions are of electrostatic ( i.e. , charge - charge ) type , arising from the interaction between two electrons in orbitals centered at two neighboring sites . as for an @xmath0 band ,",
    "the hartree - fock decoupling of these latter terms renormalizes the hopping integrals and we will show that they are responsible for the different @xmath8 bandwidths for up and down spins which are obtained in local spin density functional calculations for the @xmath2 fm elements ( fe , co , ni ) . furthermore , the nearest neighbor distances being very close for the three metals , it is expected that the nearest neighbor coulomb interactions should not vary significantly from fe to co and ni .",
    "it will be seen that , under this assumption , an excellent agreement is found between local spin density and our tight - binding hartree - fock ( tbhf ) calculations for the band structure , the densities of states , as well as the magnetic moment of the three elements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we recall ( sec .",
    "ii ) the @xmath0 band ( extended hubbard hartree - fock ) model in which all interactions are limited to first nearest neighbors and derive an analytic generalized stoner criterion . including electrostatic as well as exchange interactions .",
    "then we revisit the simple model of a constant density of states which can be solved analytically,@xcite and we show that the onset of the stoner instability and the condition of occurrence of saturated ferromagnetism are strongly dependent on the ratio of the two - site electrostatic interaction and exchange interaction .",
    "finally , in order to illustrate the role of the shape of the density of states , we consider the case of three - dimensional lattices : simple ( sc ) , body centered ( bcc ) and face centered ( fcc ) cubic lattice for reasonable parameters , with particular emphasis on the role played by inter - site coulomb interactions . in sec .",
    "iii , the multi - band @xmath1 tbhf model , already described by barreteau _",
    "et al._,@xcite is extended by including the electrostatic inter - site coulomb matrix elements , and the determination of the parameters is discussed .",
    "this model is finally used in sec .",
    "iv to analyze the band structures of fm transition metals : fe , co and ni .",
    "we will show that the main effects which can be understood for the @xmath0 band using some analytic arguments apply also qualitatively to @xmath2 transition metals .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec . v.",
    "we start from a tight - binding model for an @xmath0 band and assume that the set of atomic ( @xmath0 ) orbitals @xmath9 centered at each site @xmath10 is orthogonal .",
    "we consider the same hamiltonian as hirsch@xcite with inter - site interactions limited to first nearest neighbors which , in the second quantization formalism , can be written : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the creation operator of an electron with spin @xmath13 in the atomic orbital centered at site @xmath10 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the hopping integral between nearest neighbors .",
    "the coulomb interactions are described by the leading on - site term @xmath16 , and by the two - site terms : charge - charge interactions @xmath17 , exchange interactions @xmath18 , and the pair hopping term @xmath19 , @xmath20 we will consider in most cases the realistic relation @xmath21 , as obtained for real wave functions from eqs .",

    "note also that the spin conservation implies that any average @xmath23 vanishes when @xmath24 and @xmath25 have different spins .",
    "consequently the hfa leads to a one - particle hamiltonian : @xmath26 with the following spin - dependent hopping integrals and orbital energies , @xmath27 @xmath28 stands for the double counting energy terms and @xmath29 is the number of nearest neighbors .",

    "let us now examine the effect of @xmath7 and @xmath64 . at low and high band fillings the renormalization of the hopping integral in the pm state tends to zero since @xmath45 vanishes . as a consequence , due to the term proportional to @xmath65 in @xmath63 the pm state is more easily destabilized for low values of @xmath66 since , in this case",

    "actually the most important effect of @xmath185 is the renormalization of hopping integrals , and thus of the bandwidth , which is different for up and down spins in the fm case .      in order to perform realistic calculations for the fm @xmath2 transition metals , we combined the tight - binding approach of mehl and papaconstantopoulos@xcite for the pm state with corrections originating from the electron - electron interactions in the fm states . at this point , it is important to note that for any bulk geometrical configuration the hf renormalization of the energy levels and of the hopping integrals in the pm state are implicitly included in the parameters of mehl and papaconstantopoulos .",
    "@xcite indeed , these parameters have been fitted on electronic structure calculations carried out in the density functional formalism .",
    "it is therefore convenient to take the pm state as a reference .",
    "the hamiltonian h can then be written in the following way : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the pm hamiltonian parametrized in ref .",
    "and @xmath198 is the perturbation due to the onset of ferromagnetism .",

    "the coulomb ( @xmath201 ) and exchange ( @xmath202 ) integrals have been determined from their atomic values and then reduced by appropriate screening factors as explained in ref . .",
    "it is at present not possible to get a well controlled procedure which would describe the screening of the atomic interactions when atoms build a crystal .",

    "is favored for nearly filled or empty bands by the nearest neighbor coulomb interactions . as the actual fm instabilities are rather sensitive to the system parameters , an accurate description of the density of states and realistic interaction parameters are of crucial importance to understand the behavior of @xmath2 transition metals .",
    "next we have shown that the behavior found for the non - degenerate @xmath0 band model has important consequences in realistic transition metals .",
    "we extended the model to the case of hybridized @xmath153 and @xmath8 bands and used it to investigate the electronic structure of fm fe , co and ni .",

    "an excellent overall agreement ( band structure , densities of states , magnetic moment ) with the local spin density calculations is obtained for the three elements .    finally , it has to be emphasized that this renormalization of the hopping integrals is also present in the non - magnetic case and is a function of the environment of the pair of atoms involved in the hopping .",
