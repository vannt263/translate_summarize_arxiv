    "the mathematical theory for global existence and regularity of solutions to the ( scalar ) reaction - diffusion equation is considered a central problem in understanding models of ( non-)degenerate reaction - diffusion systems for a variety of applied problems , especially in chemistry and biology .",
    "it is also essential , for practical applications , to be able to understand , and even predict , the long time behavior of the solutions of such systems .",
    "it is well - known that the asymptotic behavior of solutions to ( scalar ) reaction - diffusion equations can be well described by invariant attracting sets , and , in particular , by a finite - dimensional global attractor , such that , the dynamics of these equations , when restricted to these sets , is effectively described by a finite number of parameters ( see , e.g. , the monographs @xcite ) .",
    "analytical results for most pdes in the literature nowadays revolve around the most commonly found assumption that the underlying physical space @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) is smooth enough , and that at best , the boundary of @xmath2 , @xmath3 is of _ lipschitz _ class .",
    "but this is barely non - smooth , since a lipschitz boundary has a tangent plane almost everywhere . on the other hand ,",
    "not much seems to be known about partial differential equations ( except for some scarce results which we will describe below ) and their long - time behavior in general , when the physical domain @xmath2 is actually `` rough '' .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of domains whose boundary has either a fractal - like geometry or domains with cusps which are also frequently used in the applications .",
    "indeed , it can not be expected that objects in the real - world , be they are clouds , trees , snowflakes , blood vessels , etc .",
    ", will possess the structure of smooth manifolds @xcite .",
    "one of the main technical difficulties nowadays of dealing with `` bad '' domains is the scarcity of sobolev embedding theorems and interpolation results in this general context .",
    "in fact , for a general non - smooth domain the usual sobolev embedding and density theorems do not hold @xcite ( cf . also section 2 ) .    our main goal in this paper is to develop well - posedness and long - time dynamics results for reaction - diffusion equations on domains @xmath2 with `` rough '' boundaries , and then subsequently recover the existing results of this type for the same models that have been previously obtained in the case of domains with smooth boundary @xmath3 . along these lines",
    ", we first establish a number of results for scalar reaction - diffusion equations , including results on existence , regularity , uniqueness of weak and strong solutions , existence and finite dimensionality of global and exponential attractors , and existence of lyapunov functions .",
    "to be more precise , we shall be concerned with diffusion processes in `` rough '' domains @xmath2 , described by the equation@xmath4subject to the following nonlocal robin boundary condition@xmath5and the initial condition @xmath6 in eqn .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) , @xmath7 plays the role of nonlinear source , not necessarily monotone , and @xmath8 is a certain nonlocal operator characterizing the presence of `` fractional '' diffusion along @xmath3 ( see eq .",
    "the normal derivative @xmath9 is understood in the sense of ( [ ne ] ) specified below , @xmath10 denotes the restriction to @xmath3 of the @xmath11-dimensional hausdorff measure @xmath12 , @xmath13 is an appropriate positive regular borel measure on @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , _ the regularity assumptions we will impose on _ @xmath3 _ enter through the measure _ @xmath13 in ( [ 1.2 ] )",
    ". we will make this more precise in section [ prelim ] . since for a `` rough '' domain",
    "@xmath2 the boundary @xmath3 may be so irregular that no normal vector can be defined , we will use the following generalized version of a normal derivative in the weak sense introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be again a borel measure on @xmath3 and let @xmath14 be a measurable function . if there exists a function @xmath15 such that @xmath16for all @xmath17 , then we say that @xmath13 is the _ normal measure _ of @xmath18 which we denoted by @xmath19 . if @xmath20 exists , then it is unique and @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 exists , then we will denote by @xmath25 the generalized normal measure of @xmath26 .",
    "the derivative @xmath27 that we denote by @xmath28 will be called the generalized normal derivative of @xmath29 . to justify this definition ,",
    "consider the special case of a bounded domain @xmath0 whose boundary is lipschitz continuous , @xmath30 the outer normal to @xmath3 and let @xmath10 be the ( natural ) surface measure on @xmath3 ( in this case , @xmath10 also coincides with @xmath31 ) . if @xmath32 is such that there are @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35for all @xmath17 , then @xmath36 with @xmath37 . throughout the following , without any mention , for a bounded arbitrary domain @xmath38 we will always mean the identity ( [ ne ] ) for the generalized outer normal derivative of @xmath29 .",
    "the interest in analysis and modelling of diffusion processes in bounded domains whose ( part of the )  boundary possess a fractal geometry arises from mathematical physics , and dates back to the early 1980 s .",
    "the first analytical results aimed at understanding transmission problems , which , in electrostatics and magnetostatics , describe heat transfer through a fractal - like interface ( such as , the snowflake ) , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the type of parabolic problems we consider also occur in the field of the so - called hydraulic fracturing , a frequently used engineering method to increase the flow of oil from a reservoir into a producing oil well ( see @xcite ; cf .",
    "also @xcite for a related application ) .",
    "further examples are also provided in the book of dautray and lions @xcite . in all these applications ,",
    "the mathematical model is usually a linear parabolic boundary value problem involving a transmission condition on a fractal - like interface ( layer ) which is often a robin boundary condition . the reaction - diffusion equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) on unbounded fractal domains has also been considered in @xcite , and in @xcite , for bounded fractal domains for which the usual sobolev - type inequalities hold and for which ( [ 1.1 ] ) is equipped with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath3 .",
    "the latter contributions devote their attention mainly to some existence results for some special cases of nonlinearities .",
    "the motivation to consider ( 1.1)-([1.3 ] ) is also inspired by a wider and challenging problems aimed at simulating the diffusion of e.g. medical sprays in the bronchial tree @xcite . in this case",
    ", the geometry of the underlying physical domain can be simulated by some classes of self - similar ramified domains with a fractal boundary .",
    "oxygen diffusion between the lungs and the circulatory system takes place only in the last generations of the lung tree , so that a reasonable diffusion model may need to involve nonlocal robin boundary conditions ( [ 1.2 ] ) on the top boundary ( the smallest structures ) , see section [ prelim ] ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "it would be extremely useful if one could give a unified analysis of the reaction - diffusion problem ( [ 1.1])-([1.3 ] ) for a large class of rough domains , including the specified families of `` fractal '' domains and/or domains with cusps , using only a minimal number of regularity properties for @xmath2 , and then use these assumptions about the specific form of the domain , leading to specific models , to derive sharp results about existence , regularity and stability of solutions .",
    "then , it is also essential , for further practical applications , to show the existence of the global attractor for our general model , and then to determine whether the dynamics restricted to this global attractor is finite - dimensional or not . among the first important contributions made to understand the linear problem associated with eqns .",
    "( [ 1.1])-([1.2 ] ) , in general bounded open sets @xmath2 with no _ essential _ regularity assumptions on @xmath39 can be found in @xcite ( cf . also @xcite for related results ) . in particular , in @xcite it is shown that the unique solution of the linear problem is given in terms of a strongly continuous ( linear ) semigroup of contraction operators on @xmath40 that is order preserving , nonexpansive on @xmath41 , and ultracontractive ( see section 2 ; cf .",
    "also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 3 - 5 ) ) .",
    "the first tool used to derive this result is the validity of the following inequality , for arbitrary open sets @xmath2 with finite measure,@xmath42which holds for any @xmath43 , for some @xmath44 .",
    "this crucial inequality is due to mazya @xcite .",
    "we recall that for lipschitz domains , the optimal exponent on the left - hand side of ( [ mai ] ) is @xmath45 while for _ arbitrary _ open domains @xmath38 the best optimal exponent is @xmath46 , see section 2.2 .",
    "the second tool is the notion of relative capacity  with respect to @xmath2 @xcite , which is a fundamental tool both in classical analysis and potential theory .",
    "its most common property is that it measures small sets more precisely than the usual lebesgue measure .",
    "with both these tools at disposal , the local robin boundary condition ( that is , @xmath47 in eqn . ( [ 1.2 ] ) ) for the linear heat equation has been investigated in @xcite ( and the references therein ) under the _ stronger _ restriction that @xmath2 possesses the extension property of sobolev functions .",
    "the ( linear ) elliptic system associated with equations ( [ 1.1])-([1.2 ] ) has also been considered in @xcite , also without any essential regularity assumptions on @xmath2 .",
    "these latter references are mainly concerned with the existence of weak solutions for these elliptic systems and several apriori estimates .",
    "in addition to deriving well - posedness and regularity results for our nonlinear model , perhaps the study of the asymptotic behavior is equally as important as it is essential to be able to understand , and even predict , the long time behavior of the solutions of our system .",
    "one object well - suited to describe the long - time behavior is the global attractor .",
    "assuming @xmath48 is a function which satisfies , for appropriate positive constants,@xmath49and@xmath50resembling the same classical assumptions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we prove in section 3.2 that ( [ 1.1])-([1.3 ] ) generates a nonlinear continuous semigroup @xmath51 acting on the phase space @xmath52 ( see corollary dyn_system ) .",
    "this semigroup possesses the global attractor @xmath53 , which is compact in @xmath52 , bounded in @xmath41 and has finite fractal dimension ( see corollary [ gl_fin ] ) .",
    "in addition , we show that every unique orbit @xmath54 @xmath55 , of the parabolic problem ( [ 1.1])-([1.3 ] ) `` instantaneously '' exhibits an improved regularity both in space and time . more precisely , every such weak solution becomes a strong solution ( see section 3.3 ) ; hence , @xmath53 contains only strong solutions .",
    "in fact , the aim of the whole section 3.1 is to verify the existence of ( unique ) strong solutions which are smooth enough ( even with more general assumptions than ( [ star1])-([star2 ] ) ) .",
    "one of the advantages of this result is that every weak solution can be approximated by the strong ones and the rigorous justification of the regularity results for such solutions becomes immediate .",
    "in particular , exploiting mazya inequality ( [ mai ] ) we extend the scheme developed initially by alikakos @xcite for reaction - diffusion equations , to derive that a particular smoothing property holds for all weak solutions of ( [ 1.1])-([1.3 ] ) with a function @xmath56 satisfying ( [ star1])-([star2 ] ) . here",
    "we emphasize again that the original proofs due to alikakos @xcite rely heavily on the application of the gagliardo - nirenberg - sobolev inequality which unfortunately is no longer valid in our context .",
    "besides , in our iteration scheme we need to get good control of certain constants in such a way that they do not depend on ( the bad behavior of ) @xmath3 . furthermore , a key point of this analysis is to employ an appropriate fixed point argument , coupled together with a hidden regularity theorem ( appendix , theorem [ ap_reg_thm ] ) for a non - autonomous equation governed by an accretive operator , to deduce smooth strong solutions which are differentiable almost everywhere on @xmath57 .",
    "this regularity is crucial to show , for instance , that problem ( [ 1.1])-(1.3 ) has a lyapunov function on the global attractor @xmath58 ( see lemma [ l2 ] and theorem [ lf ] ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath53 depends on the choice of boundary conditions ( [ 1.2 ] ) and the measure @xmath13 on @xmath3 ( see , for instance , theorems ( a ) and ( b ) below ) . at this point",
    "one could argue that the long - time behavior of system ( [ 1.1])-([1.3 ] ) is properly described by the global attractor .",
    "however , it is well - known that the global attractor can present several drawbacks , among which we can mention that it may only attract the trajectories at a slow rate , and that the rate of attraction is very difficult , if not impossible , to express in terms of the physical observable quantities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in many situations , the global attractor may not be even observable in experiments or in numerical simulations .",
    "this can be seen , for instance , for the one - dimensional chaffee - infante equation@xmath59on the interval @xmath60 , with cubic nonlinearity @xmath61 and non - homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions ( i.e. , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , in which case every trajectory is exponentially attracted to the `` single point '' attractor @xmath64 . on the other hand , this problem possesses many interesting metastable almost stationary  equilibria which live up to a time @xmath65 and , thus , for @xmath66 small , one will not see the global attractor in numerical simulations .",
    "this is known to happen , for instance , for some models of one - dimensional burgers equations and models of pattern formation in chemotaxis ( see @xcite , for further references ) .",
    "henceforth , in some situations , the global attractor may fail to capture important transient behaviors . besides , in the general setting of arbitrary open domains , this feature can be further amplified for our system due to the boundary condition ( [ 1.2 ] ) and the `` rough '' nature of the domain @xmath2 near @xmath3 .",
    "it is thus also important to construct larger objects which contain the global attractor , attract the trajectories at a fast ( typically , exponential ) rate which can be computed explicitly in terms of the physical parameters , and are still finite dimensional .",
    "a natural object is the exponential attractor ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) ; cf .",
    "also below ) . in section [ gl ] , we prove the existence of such an exponential attractor not only for the dynamical systems generated by the weak solutions ( see theorem [ expo ] ) but also by the strong solutions , which require essentially no growth assumptions on the nonlinearity as @xmath67 ( see theorem [ expo2 ] ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the assumption on @xmath56 reads:@xmath68for some @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the best sobolev / poincar constant into ( [ mai ] ) .",
    "the latter result seems to be new for ( [ 1.1])-(1.3 ) even when @xmath2 is a smooth domain .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ wel ] for the precise assumptions , related results and generalizations .",
    "we emphasize that the measure @xmath13  and/or boundary regularity assumptions we employ are of general character , and as a result do not require any specific form of the domain @xmath2 ; this abstraction allows ( [ 1.1])-([1.3 ] ) to recover all of the existing diffusion models that have been previously studied in smooth bounded domains ( including lipschitz domains ) , as well as to represent a much larger family of models for ( [ 1.1])-(1.3 ) that have not been explicitly studied in detail . as a result ,",
    "the system in ( [ 1.1])-([1.3 ] ) includes reaction - diffusion models , on domains @xmath2 which possess the @xmath71-extension property of sobolev functions , and non - lipschitz domains whose boundary is only hlder continuous , as special cases , and on many arbitrary open bounded domains @xmath2 ( satisfying , for instance , ( [ mai ] ) ) not previously identified . in section",
    "[ sum ] , we discuss how the unified analysis presented here can be used to establish the same results for other important classes of partial differential equations , such as , reaction - diffusion systems for a vector - valued function @xmath72    the following theorems can be treated as _ special _ cases of our results .",
    "they apply for instance to domains @xmath2  with a `` fractal '' boundary @xmath73    [ tha]assume that @xmath2 has the @xmath71-extension property of sobolev functions and @xmath56 satisfies ( [ star1])-([star2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath13 be the restriction to @xmath3 of the @xmath74-dimensional hausdorff measure @xmath75 for any @xmath76 .",
    "then , the dynamical system @xmath77 , @xmath78 associated with weak solutions for the parabolic problem ( [ 1.1])-([1.3 ] ) is gradient - like and possesses the global attractor @xmath53 of finite fractal dimension . moreover",

    "first , we note that when @xmath84 but @xmath85 is locally infinite , that is , for all @xmath86 and @xmath87 we have that @xmath88 in this case the boundary value problem ( [ 1.1])-([1.2 ] ) coincides with the ( homogeneous ) dirichlet problem for ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "if ( [ loc_inf ] ) only holds on part of the boundary @xmath89 , dirichlet boundary conditions are satisfied on that part @xmath90 and the usual ( nonlocal ) robin boundary condition ( [ 1.2 ] ) is satisfied on the remaining part @xmath91 . on the other hand , for domains with fractal boundaries @xmath92",
    ", one often finds some @xmath93 such that@xmath94 in this case , one may think of ( [ 1.2 ] ) as a generalized ( nonlocal ) robin boundary condition ( @xmath95 ) for the boundary value problem ( 1.1)-([1.3 ] ) .",
