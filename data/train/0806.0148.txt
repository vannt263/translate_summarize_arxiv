    "semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have manifold uses in quantum information and computation .",
    "they have been utilized to generate single - photons  @xcite with good indistinguishability  @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been proposed and partially realized  @xcite that qds in two - exciton states , called biexcitons , can be used to generate pairs of entangled photons , by cascade emission of photons  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of photon pairs in this scheme was noted  @xcite to be imperfect , because of the slight difference in energy between the two single - exciton levels  @xcite .",
    "however , considerable improvement has recently been made  @xcite , which suggests that the scheme should be of high experimental value in quantum optics , quantum computation  @xcite and quantum cryptography  @xcite , and can also be used to test foundations of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "biexciton is also of interest in itself because it serves as the physical basis for a 2-bit conditional quantum logic gate  @xcite .",
    "a number of works have already been done on the optical coherent control of the single - exciton states in , e.g. , inas / gaas qds  @xcite and cdse / znse qds  @xcite . in the recent experiments of optical coherent control of biexciton states ,",
    "two approaches were used .",
    "the first one applies two optical beams each in resonance with the @xmath0 ( ground state to single exciton ) and @xmath1 ( single- to bi - exciton ) transitions  @xcite .",
    "however , it was noted  @xcite that a better approach is to apply degenerate pulses with frequency equal to half the biexciton energy , such that the spontaneously emitted photons have frequencies different from that of the excitation pulse .",
    "this has been followed by recent works  @xcite .",
    "experiments have been done on both inas / gaas and cdse / znse qds , and the phenomenon of two - photon rabi oscillation is the prime indicator of successful control in these experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to use a frequency - sweeping pulse  @xcite for a geometric generation of a biexciton in a quantum dot .",
    "the scheme is based on the adiabatic state transfer from the ground state to the final biexciton state via avoided energy level crossing , in which the intermediate exciton is bypassed .",
    "the utilization of level anti - crossing follows the idea of the stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) for adiabatic state transfer in a @xmath2-type 3-level system  @xcite . but here since both the exciton and biexciton transitions couple to the same optical pulse , independent control of the two transitions as required in the stirap is not feasible . instead",
    ", the frequency sweeping  @xcite is proposed to realize the adiabatic state evolution .",
    "the geometric scheme bears the robustness against some uncertainty in the system parameters such as energy levels and dipole magnitude and in laser pulse parameters such as amplitude , shape , and frequency , which is unavoidable in realistic experiments .",
    "bypassing the intermediate single - exciton state minimizes the possibility of generating single - photon emission which , e.g. , may contaminate an entangled photon pair in quantum optics application . constrained by the biexciton binding energy , the adiabatic state transfer can be completed in picosecond timescales for a typical cdse quantum dot , and thus the effect of the exciton dephasing can be largely avoided .",

    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] we formulate the problem and give the waveform of the pulse used ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] we demonstrate numerically the creation of a biexciton which is robust against small uncertainty in all parameters characterizing the system and keeps the occupation of single - exciton state relatively low ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : effects - of - dephasing ] we show that dephasing , modeled in the lindblad formalism  @xcite , only slightly reduce the efficiency .",
    "the biexciton system can be modeled by a four - level system : the ground state @xmath3 , the biexciton state @xmath4 , and two intermediate single - exciton states with different linear polarizations @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite . because the two pathways of excitation , @xmath7and @xmath8 , is independent and can be implemented independently by applying different polarizations of excitation in experiments , we only consider @xmath7 .    ):",
