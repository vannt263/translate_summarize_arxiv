    "entanglement and nonlocality are some of the most emblematic concepts embodied in quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "recent developments in quantum computation@xcite and quantum information ( e.g. @xcite ) evoke interest in the properties of quantum entanglement .",
    "now we have known that a state of a composite quantum system is called entangled ( or inseparable ) if it can not be represented as a convex combination of tensor products of its subsystem states@xcite . in the case of pure states ,",
    "one has obtained a complete understanding , that is , a pure state is entangled if and only if it violates bell s inequality9,10,11 .",
    "but the case for mixed states is much more complicated ( e.g.12,13 ) . besides the above definition of entangled state ,",
    "another qualitative criterion proposed by peres@xcite is more practicable to determine whether a given state is inseparable , although it is sufficient and necessary only for sone simple quantum system , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems . on the other hand ,",
    "one is more interested in the quantitative measure of entangled states",
    ". various entanglement measure has been proposed .",
    "for example , for two - party system , there are following kinds of measure : the entanglement of formation@xcite , the relative entropy of entanglement@xcite , and the robustness of entanglement@xcite , _ etc .",
    "_    consider the relative entropy associated with entangled state @xmath2 of two - qubit system . in order to obtain the relative entropy of entanglement of @xmath2 ,",
    "the crucial point is to find a separable state @xmath3 such that minimizes the relative entropy @xmath4 defined as @xmath5 in general case , to find @xmath3 is a laborious work .",
    "then recall the robustness of entanglement .",
    "it is said that given an entangled state @xmath2 and a separable state @xmath3 there always exists a minimal real @xmath6 for which @xmath7is separable .",
    "such minimal @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath9 , is called robustness of @xmath2 relative to @xmath3 .",
    "then the entanglement embodied in @xmath2 can be measured by the absolute robustness of @xmath2 , which is obtained by means of finding a separable state @xmath10 such that @xmath11 is minimal .",
    "we can see that both in relative entropy and in robustness , finding a specific separable state is of essence .",
    "additionally , let s consider another useful tool to study entanglement , _",
    "i.e. _ , lewenstein - sanpera ( l - s ) decomposition@xcite .",
    "lewenstein _ et.al .",
    "_ have shown that any state of two - qubit system can be decomposed as @xmath12 , \\]]where @xmath13is a separable state , and @xmath14 denotes a single pure entangled projector @xmath15 , that is , @xmath14 represents a pure entangled state .",
    "it is known that there are many different l - s decomposition with varying values of @xmath16 and various @xmath14 s . among them",

    "( 3 ) , @xmath17where @xmath18is the degree of separability possessed by @xmath19 .",
    "in other words , the entanglement possessed by @xmath19 can be represented as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the entanglement of its pure state expressed in terms of the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of either of its subsystems:@xmath22here again , in the sense of maximizing or minimizing some quality , a specific separable state @xmath23 appears .    from the above consideration",
    ", we show that there are some specific separable states playing an important role in determining the entanglement measure .",
    "then it is meaningful to determine the properties of these separable states .",
    "a fact provokes our attention . that is , at least for two - qubit system the set of separable states , denoted by @xmath24 , is compact and convex19",
    ". then boundary of @xmath24 does exist .",
    "we argue in this paper that these special separable states mentioned above are on the boundary of @xmath25 . in the following , we give the criterion to determine whether a separable state is on the boundary . taking this into account ,",
    "we present more clear interpretations on some concepts concerning quantum entanglement .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the two - qubit quantum system .",
    "the states can be represented in the hilbert space @xmath26 .",
    "so we also call it 2@xmath272 quantum system .",
    "we know that all @xmath28 hermitian matrices span a 16-dimensional real hilbert space , denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "all density matrices of states forms a subset of @xmath30 .",
    "we choose hilber - schimdt metric , that is , for @xmath31 , the norm is defined as @xmath32 ^{\\frac{% 1}{2}}=\\left [ tr\\left ( a^{2}\\right ) \\right ] ^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , and for @xmath33 , the distance of @xmath34 and @xmath35 is@xmath36 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    for two - qubit system , a given state @xmath19 is separable , i.e. @xmath37 , if and only if the partial transposition of @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath38 or @xmath39 @xmath40 , is also positive@xcite , or equivalently , the partial time - reversal of @xmath41 , denoted by @xmath42 , is positive .",

    "proof _ note that @xmath62 and @xmath24 is compact and convex and that @xmath49 is in the interior of @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath63 is on the boundary of @xmath24 , let us consider the mixture with form of eq.(8 ) , that is ,    @xmath64    from @xcite , we know that such @xmath65 does not belong to @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath67 , there are two possibilities for @xmath65 .",
    "that is , either @xmath65 is positive and thus represents an entangled state , or @xmath65 is non - positive and does not represent any physical state . in the former case ,",
    "any point on the line segment from @xmath49 to @xmath65 represents a real physical state , and particularly , all the points ( except @xmath68 ) on the line segment from @xmath63 to @xmath65 are entangled states .",
    "let @xmath69 , then @xmath70 .",
    "correspondingly @xmath71 . under this condition",
    ", the distance between @xmath63 and @xmath65 can be arbitrarily small .",
    "note that both @xmath63 and @xmath72 are clearly positive and that @xmath65 is also positive . but",
    "@xmath73 is non - positive .",
    "so by connectivity of the space and continuity of @xmath74 we conclude that @xmath72 must have vanishing eigenvalue . for the other case in which",
    "@xmath65 is non - positive and does not represent real state , similar analysis shows that @xmath63 has at least one vanishing eigenvalue .    to prove the reverse .",
    "we first consider a separable state @xmath3 the eigenvalues of which can be denoted by @xmath75 , that is , @xmath3 has at least one vanishing eigenvalue .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is in the interior of @xmath66 . due to the compactness and convexity of @xmath24 and with the help of @xcite , we know that there always exists a @xmath54 such that the mixture @xmath51 in the form @xmath76 is also in the interior of @xmath24",
    ". the eigenvalues of @xmath77 , denoted by @xmath78 , can be easily calculated , that is , @xmath79    obviously , for @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 . then @xmath82 is non - positive and can not belong to @xmath24 .",
    "this result contradicts with the assumption made above .",
    "hence @xmath3 can not be in the interior and can only be on the boundary of @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath83 . on the other hand , let s consider a separable state @xmath3 such that @xmath84 has one vanishing eigenvalue , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath85 . also assume that @xmath3 is in the interior of @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath51 is the interior point of @xmath24 for some @xmath86 .",
    "so @xmath87 is necessarily positive .",
    "denote the eigenvalues of @xmath88 by @xmath89 .",
    "similar analysis will demonstrate that one of the eigenvalues of @xmath88 , which is actually @xmath90 , is negative .",
    "it is contrary to the assumption .",
    "so @xmath83 .",
    "having obtained the description of the boundary of @xmath24 , we now return to think about some concepts of quantum entanglement .      in @xcite ,",
    "vedrel _ et.al .",
    "_ propose the concept of relative entropy of entanglement and give the numberical results for some examples of two - qubit entangled states .",
    "for instance , given entangled state @xmath2 as@xmath91where @xmath92 . the separable state which minimize the relative entropy @xmath93 ( cf .",
    "eq.(1 ) ) is said to be@xmath94straightforward computation shows that @xmath3 has a vanishing eigenvalue .",
    "then @xmath3 is on the boundary of @xmath24 .",
    "this result also holds in the other examples mentioned in @xcite .",
    "so we can say , at least for these specific cases , the relative entropy of entanglement can be achieved on the boundary of the set of separable states .",
    "it is possible to generalize this result .",
    "recall that the robustness of entanglement proposed by vidal _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the geometrical interpretation has been obtained in @xcite , in which the boundary of @xmath24 is not yet explicitly defined .",
    "the discussion in this letter can be supplementary to @xcite .",
    "we can say that for a given entangled state @xmath2 of two - qubit system , if @xmath8 in eq.(2 ) is minimal among all separable states @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath8 is the absolute robustness of @xmath2 , then @xmath3 and @xmath95 in eq.(2 ) are necessarily on the boundary of @xmath24 .",
    "now let us give our interpretation for l - s decomposition .",
    "recall the form of l - s decomposition represented by eq.(3 ) . using hilbert - schmidt metric",
    "defined by eq.(6 ) , we can express the @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) as @xmath96as shown in fig.1 , @xmath16 can be regarded as the ratio of the length of line segment @xmath97 to that of @xmath98 . with @xmath14 ( point @xmath34 in fig . 1 ) and @xmath41 ( point @xmath35 ) fixed , @xmath16 reaches the maximal when @xmath3 is on the boundary of @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the length of @xmath98 is minimal . in the geometrical view , this result is straightforward .",
    "so we can always rewrite eq .",
    "( 5 ) as @xmath99 , \\]]where @xmath63 is on the boundary and @xmath100 is the maximal @xmath16 associated with @xmath14 . obviously , for eq.(4 ) @xmath23 is on the boundary of @xmath24 and can be written as @xmath101 while @xmath102 can be expressed as @xmath103 .    in @xcite ,",
    "englert _ et al .",
    "_ have erred to what is involved in l - s decomposition , that is , if @xmath104 is the optimal decomposition , then ( a ) the state @xmath105 is non - separable for @xmath106 ; and ( b ) the state @xmath107 is either non - positive or non - separable for each @xmath108 .",
    "it is said in @xcite that their verification is rather complicated even in seemingly simple cases .",
    "but in our view , it is easy to understand .",
    "now we give our explanation as follows .    for conclusion ( a ) ,",
    "since the optimal decomposition of @xmath19 has been obtained , @xmath101 is necessarily on the boundary of @xmath24 .",
    "thus the convexity of @xmath24 guarantees that all points on the line segment _ ad _ ( cf fig .",
    "1 ) can not belong to @xmath24 and without choice represent entangled states .",
    "these states are expressed as the convex sum of @xmath109 and @xmath101 , i.e. , @xmath110 .",
    "in addition , this conclusion also holds without the `` optimal '' condition .",
    "that is , for any decomposition determined by eq .",
    "( 14 ) , conclusion ( a ) is valid .    for conclusion ( b ) , let @xmath111or equivalently , @xmath112the right - handed of eq . ( 16 ) is just the optimal decomposition of @xmath19 .",
    "we already know that @xmath102 is the largest @xmath100 of all possible decomposition ( cf eq.(14 ) ) .",
    "if the mixture on the left - hand of eq.(16 ) does represent @xmath19 , the weight of @xmath113 must be less than @xmath102 .",
    "in other words , the left - hand of eq.(16 ) can not be a real l - s decomposition about @xmath41 . hence @xmath114 .",
    "theore , either @xmath113 can not be positive , or can represent a non - separable state . the conclusion ( b )",
    "can be demonstrated in fig .",
    "2 . of course",
    "the `` optimal '' condition is necessary in this case .",
    "so far we have discussed the boundary of the set of all separable states . using this concept , we give straightforward explanations for some entanglement measure of the mixed states , mainly for l - s decomposition .",
    "we feel that introducing boundary may be helpful for better understanding of entanglement .",
