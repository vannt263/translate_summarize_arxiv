    "the hydrogen - deficiency in extremely hot post - agb stars of spectral class pg 1159 , which includes about 40 stars , with @xmath2 ranging from 75000 and 200000 k and log @xmath3 from 5.5 to 7.5 , is probably caused by a very late thermal pulse in the he shell ( vltp , schnberner 1979 , iben 1984 ) while the post - agb star is in the hot wd cooling sequence .",
    "because of the high @xmath4 @xmath5 in pg 1159 stars , all species are highly ionized and , hence , most metals are only accessible by uv spectroscopy . a passionate work has been conducted in the last 20 years by klaus werner and collaborators ( werner & herwig 2006 , werner et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 and references therein ) . in table 1",
    "we report in particular the range of peculiar abundances of he , c , n , o estimated in pg 1159 stars , where the mass fraction of he ranges between 0.30 and 0.85 , c between 0.15 and 0.40 , n between 0.001 and 0.01 , and o between 0.02 and 0.2 . the energy released by",
    "the vltp forces the stellar radius to inflate and the star to cool and proceed back toward a born - again agb . at the maximum extension of the convective thermal instability",
    "the very small residual and inactivated h shell is likely engulfed by the pulse and severly depleted , so that the usually hidden he- , c - rich and s - rich he intershell is eventually exposed to the photosphere .",
    "pg 1159 stars are seemingly descendants of [ wc ] stars , which show similar hecno peculiarities .",
    "sakurai s object ( v4334 sgr ) was discovered in 1996 and soon recognized to be the central star of an old planetary nebula ( 6000 yr ago ) .",
    "it recently underwent a vltp and is now a hydrogen - deficient born - again agb star .",
    "the estimated mass fractions he / c / o = 0.90/0.07/0.03 and other element abundances ( asplund et al .",
    "1998 , their figure 6 ) are reported in table 1 and compared with pg1159 stars .",
    "this composition is based on the choice of the best adopted atmospheric model with c / he @xmath6 0.10 ( by number ) .",
    "note that there is a `` carbon problem '' for sakurai s object similar to that encountered for the hydrogen - deficient rcrb stars .",
    "indeed , the spectroscopic c abundance derived from ci lines is about 0.6 dex smaller than the one deduced from the selected model atmosphere .",
    "the same is the case for [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , the relative abundance ratios , like [ el / fe ] , are scarcely dependent on the c / he choice . in fig . 1",
    "left panel we compare the observed [ el / fe ] data of sakurai s object with predicted abundances in the he intershell at the last thermal pulse for an agb model of @xmath7 = 3 @xmath8 , [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.3 , case st/4.5 . given the uncertainty of the initial metallicity , we also plot in the figure a similar predicted [ el / fe ] distribution for @xmath7 = 3 @xmath8 , [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.5 and case st/12 ( dashed line ) . in this case , sc and rb appear better reproduced , but the reverse is true for c and cu . as to sr , its abundance in october 1996 was overestimated .",
    "the presence of carbon dust buffers around sakurai s object may in general introduce a noticeable uncertainty in spectroscopic abundances . v 605 aql ( nova aql 1919 )",
    "is a second star having likely suffered a vltp about 90 yr ago .",
    "clayton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated he / c / o = 0.54/0.40/0.05 .",
    "both v106 aql and sakurai s object showed peculiar rapid declines and fading characteristic of episodic carbon dust emission , as in the case of r crb stars .",
    "however , as discussed below , several r crb stars likely originated in a completely different way , as binary wd mergers .      in order to produce a consistent amount of n and to achieve",
    "the low @xmath0c/@xmath1c observed in sakurai s object , ingestion and burning of hydrogen in a tp is impossible when the h shell is still active .",
    "it may work when a very thin h envelope is left after the star leaves the agb ( herwig et al .",
    "1999 , miller bertolami et al .",
    "2006 ) . a quite low @xmath0c/@xmath1c @xmath10 10 results while a consistent amount of @xmath11n is built up . during the agb phase , standard elemental mass fractions in the he",
    "intershell after a thermal pulse are he / c / o = 0.75/0.20/0.005 .",
    "higher c and o abundances may be obtained by including an efficient overshoot at the base of the convective thermal pulse in the tp - agb phase ( herwig et al .",
    "alternatively , proper account should be given to the peeling effect by mass loss both at the tip of the agb and in the early phase of the post - agb track .",
    "there , a `` superwind '' of up to several 10@xmath12 @xmath8/yr has been measured .",
    "lawlor & macdonald ( 2006 ) introduced these effects in their stellar evolution code in an wide spectrum of initial masses and metallicities .",
    "another important factor is the thickness of the he buffer , which decreases with increasing the co core mass , that is with the initial stellar mass .",
    "the authors showed that chemical peculiarities observed in stars having suffered the vltp do not strictly require overshoot in the agb phase .",
    "one should also consider that the bottom of the vltp is degenerate , different from what occurs during the agb phase , with the possibility to further increase c and o.      the peculiar fg sge has also been assumed to have recently suffered a vltp . over the last 120 years",
    "fg sge evolving from a hot post - agb star to a present cool and born - again agb .",
    "figure 1 ( panel right ) shows the fg sge spectroscopic data by gonzalez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( full triangles ) compared with theoretical predictions ( upper curve ) in the he - intershell after the last thermal pulse for an agb initial mass of 1.5 @xmath8 , metallicity [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.3 and the @xmath1c pocket choice st @xmath13 1.3 .",
    "note the huge [ ls / fe ] , [ hs / fe ] and [ pb / fe ] , of the order of 3 dex each . the high value [ eu / fe ] = 2 dex observed is s - process eu , in agreement with the typical s - process expectation [ la / fe]@xmath14 @xmath6 1 dex .",
    "moreover , gonzalez et al . estimated @xmath0c/@xmath1c @xmath15 10 , and provided first spectroscopic evidence of h - deficiency .",
    "jeffery & schnberner ( 2006 ) reanalyzed all extant spectroscopic data and atmospheric parameters , raising doubts on the huge s - process abundances derived by gonzalez et al .",
    "the lower @xmath2 = 5500 k chosen for the model atmosphere brought jeffery & schnberner to conclude that the s - process element abundances are more that one order of magnitude less than inferred , most likely inherited already during its previous agb phase .",
    "they concluded that fg sge suffered a late thermal pulse ( ltp ) , not a vltp , then evolving back to a born - again agb . in the lower curve of figure 1",
    ", we compare the envelope agb model prediction at the last thermal pulse .",
    "note that the two indicators of the s - process distribution , [ hs / ls ] and [ pb / hs ] , would remain unaltered .",
    "the spectroscopic heavy elements have been reduced by 1.5 dex ( empty triangles ) , what corresponds to a typical factor of 30 of dilution of he intershell material mixed with the envelope .",
    "note that predicted [ c / fe ] would better compare with a ltp solution .",
    "so far about 50 r crb have been discovered .",
    "their atmospheres are extremely hydrogen deficient and carbon rich .",
    "another distinctive feature of some r crb stars is the enormous f detection , in the range 1,000 to 8,000 times solar for [ fe / h ] in the range @xmath90.5 to @xmath92.0 ( pandey et al .",
    "such drastic @xmath16o and @xmath17f excesses indicate that the merging of a co - wd with a he - wd gives rise to partial he burning and production of @xmath16o via @xmath18-capture on @xmath11n , accompanied by @xmath16o(p,@xmath19)@xmath17f .",
    "detailed nucleosynthesis calculations for these peculiar objects are not easy however .",
    "a subclass of presolar sic grains discovered in carbonaceus meteorites , the sic of type ab ( 4 to 5 % of all presolar sic grains ) are characterized by very low @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratios , in the range 2 to 10 .",
    "mainstream sic ( covering 93% of all presolar sic grains ) , show higher @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratios , from @xmath2010 to 100 ( solar ratio is 89 ) , averaging at around 60 ( zinner 1998 , 2008 ) .",
    "while mainstream sic likely originated in low mass agb stars of around solar metallicity , the stellar origin of sic ab grains is still enigmatic .",
    "these grains clearly show the signature of h burning in the cno cycle and h burning is also indicated by their relatively high inferred @xmath21al/@xmath22al ratios ( amari et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , the low @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratios are difficult to reconcile with the condition c@xmath15o , necessary for sic condensation .",
    "j - type carbon stars and born - again agbs like sakurai s object have been proposed as sources of ab grains . despite sic ab grains",
    "show low @xmath0c/@xmath1c , the permil variations of @xmath23si/@xmath24si and @xmath25si/@xmath24si with respect to solar is indistinguishable from mainstream sic that reach maximum values of @xmath6200 and @xmath6150 , respectively . instead , far higher permil variations are predicted in the he intershell .",
    "this indicates that sic ab grains are incompatible with an origin in born - again agbs like sakurai s object , unless one speculates that the grains formed in a cool circumstellar disk , after having been mixed with previously ejected material .",
    "very rare high - density graphite grains have been discovered with the signature of he intershell in the trace elements ca and ti ( jadhav et al .",
    "a couple of examples are reported in the two panels of fig .",
    "3 , for the grains g-34 and g-40 .",
    "a similar exceptional permil variation has been detected for both ca and ti in grain g-9 . also trace mg and si are present but they show essentially normal isotopic composition , maybe related with isotopic equilibration with solar material .",
