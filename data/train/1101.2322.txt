    "in sun - as - a - star helioseismology , it is common practice to fix the amplitude ratios between the @xmath1-components of the @xmath3 and 3 multiplets ( the so - called @xmath1-amplitude ratio ) during the peak - fitting procedure when estimating the p - mode characteristics ( e.g. , salabert et al . [ 1 ] ) , while the amplitudes of the @xmath4 , 2 , and 3 modes relative to the @xmath0 modes are left free ( the so - called mode visibility ) .",
    "however , in asteroseismology , the mode visibilities are fixed to theoretical values due to lower signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and shorter time series , and the @xmath1-amplitude ratios are expressed as a function of the inclination of the rotation axis only ( appourchaux et al . [ 2 ] ; garca et al .",
    "[ 3 ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "they are supposed to not depend on the star magnetic activity .",
    "however , in the near future , this situation could change when stellar activity cycles will be measured in asteroseismic targets ( e.g. , garca et al . [ 4 ] ) .",
    "after several years of observations collected by the kepler mission , the snr will be high enough to measure these parameters in a wide range of solar - like stars in the hr diagram at different evolution stages ( bedding et al .",
    "[ 5 ] ; chaplin et al . [ 6 ] ) . moreover",
    ", simultaneous observations from song ( doppler velocity ) and kepler ( intensity ) will be extremely useful to better understand stellar atmospheres .",
    "although , variations with the height in the solar atmosphere at which the measurements are obtained have been observed in the intensity virgo / spm data at the beginning of the soho mission ( frhlich et al .",
    "[ 7 ] ) , it has never been verified if these values change in the radial velocity golf measurements between the blue- and red - wing observing periods .",
    "we used observations collected by the space - based instruments global oscillations at low frequency ( golf ) and variability of solar irradiance and gravity oscillations ( virgo ) onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) spacecraft .",
    "golf ( gabriel et al . [ 8 ] ) measures the doppler velocity at different heights in the solar atmosphere depending on the wing  blue or red  of the sodium doublet  d1 and d2  in which the observations were performed ( garca et al . [ 9 ] ) .",
    "virgo ( frhlich et al . [ 10 ] ) is composed of three sun photometers ( spm ) at 402  nm ( blue ) , 500  nm ( green ) and 862  nm ( red ) . a total of 5021 days of golf and virgo observations starting on 1996 april 11 and ending on 2010 january 8 were analyzed , with respective duty cycles of 95.4% and 94.7% .",
    "the power spectra of the time series were fitted to extract the mode parameters ( salabert et al .",
    "[ 11 ] ) using a standard likelihood maximization function ( power spectrum with a @xmath5 with 2 d.o.f .",
    "statistics ) .",
    "each mode component was parameterized using an asymmetric lorentzian profile . since soho observes the sun equatorwards , only the @xmath6 even components are visible in sun - as - a - star observations of golf and virgo .",
    "in order to obtain observational estimates of the @xmath1-amplitude ratios , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 components of the @xmath3 multiplet , and the @xmath9 and @xmath10 components of the @xmath11 multiplet were fitted using independent amplitudes , assuming that components with opposite azimuthal order @xmath1 have the same amplitudes ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "note that the blue and red periods of golf were also analyzed separately , as well as the mean power spectrum of the three virgo spms .",
    "the amplitude of a given multiplet @xmath13 is defined as the sum of the amplitudes of its @xmath1-components , as @xmath14 .",
    "then , the visibilities of the @xmath4 , 2 , and 3 modes relative to the @xmath0 mode are respectively defined as the ratios @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : visi ] shows these visibilities for both radial velocity ( golf ) and intensity ( virgo ) measurements as a function of frequency .",
    "these raw mode visibilities present a variation with frequency  especially for the @xmath4 mode  that is due to the large variation of the mode amplitudes with frequency , even over half a large frequency separation .",
    "thus , the visibilities are biased and in order to correct them we interpolated ( using a spline interpolation ) the amplitudes of the @xmath4 , 2 , and 3 modes to the frequencies of the @xmath0 mode ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : visi ] ) . figure  [ fig : meanvisi ] shows the mode visibilities averaged over frequency for both golf and virgo observations as a function of @xmath18 ( see table  [ tab : visigolf ] ) . the amplitude ratios between the @xmath1-components of the @xmath3 and @xmath11 multiplets , defined as @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively ,",

    "when the contribution of a solar - disk element to the total flux depends only on its distance to the limb , the mode visibility and the @xmath1-amplitude ratio are decoupled ( e.g. gizon & solanki [ 13 ] ; ballot et al .",
    "[ 14 ] ) . for virgo observations ,",
    "this is verified since the contribution depends mainly on the limb - darkening .",
    "however , for golf , this is no more the case and we have performed complete computation taking into account the instrumental response , which differ for the blue and red wings .",
    "results of these computations are listed in table  [ tab : visimodel ] .",
    "the limb - darkening law of neckel & labs [ 15 ] has been used . indeed , visibility values for golf vary with frequency by a few percents due to the horizontal motions of modes that increase at low frequency . in general , these predictions agree with the observations .",
    "there is nevertheless some shortcomings : ( i ) even if the trend is correct , the difference between blue and red wings for golf is larger than expected ; ( ii ) the visibility of the @xmath11 modes in virgo are sensitively higher than expected .",
