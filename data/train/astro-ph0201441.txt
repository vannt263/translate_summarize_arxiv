    "much of the interest in these surveys of weak objects concern the evidence for star formation and agn evolution in galaxies in the early universe , at redshifts in the range 1 to 3 ( condon & yin 1990 ; rowan - robinson et al .",

    "the radio observations are unique in that at radio wavelengths it is possible to peer through the gas and dust that obscures the nuclear regions of galaxies at other wavelengths .",
    "the radio observations also have sufficient angular resolution to distinguish between emission that is driven by star formation and that driven by agn .",
    "although star forming activity in the early universe is perhaps most readily observed at sub - millimeter wavelengths , current sub - millimeter instruments do not have sufficient angular resolution to avoid confusion due to blending of nearby sources , so high resolution radio observations are needed to uniquely identify optical counterparts .",
    "moreover , because of the large negative k - correction , dusty galaxies observed at sub - mm wavelengths all have high redshifts , whereas the radio observations are sensitive to a wide range of redshift and a mix of star - burst and agn activity .",
    "as the most sensitive radio telescope available for these kinds of observations , the very large array ( vla ) has been used for many deep surveys @xcite .",
    "deep radio source surveys have also been made with the australian telescope compact array @xcite , and with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope @xcite , but with less sensitivity and poorer resolution than possible with the vla .",
    "these observations show that below levels of about 10 mjy , the number of radio sources increases more rapidly than the number between 1 mjy and 500 mjy and are composed of a different population of sources .",
    "in this paper we report on the results of new 8.4 ghz vla surveys which cover two fields , each of diameter @xmath12 to the 8% sensitivity level of the on - axis position .",
    "one field , located at @xmath13 + 43@xmath1 , which we will designate as the sa13 field , was one of the hubble space telescope medium deep survey ( mds ) key projects , observed in 1992 - 3 @xcite .",
    "these optical observations , which were made before hst refurbishment , reach a limiting sensitivity of i=25.5 mag .",
    "the extensive complementary vla observation detected sources as faint as @xmath3jy at 8.4 ghz . a preliminary account of the hst identifications in this field @xcite , hereinafter designated as paper i ,",
    "was based on the first half of these observations which were made at lower resolution , and included only radio sources located in the small 2.5 ( arcmin)@xmath14 field of view of the hst .",
    "we have also used these same vla observations of this field to examine the small scale fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite . this field has also been observed with the vla at 1.4 ghz , covering a much larger area , with additional kpno optical imaging @xcite , and with the merlin / vlbi national facility of the university of manchester at 1.4 ghz @xcite    a second field , located at @xmath15 + 50@xmath1 and designated at the hercules field , was previously imaged with wfpc2 in a 48-orbit exposure , and reaches a 10-@xmath16 point source sensitivity of about 27.7 mag in b and v and 26.8 in i @xcite .",
    "twelve known objects in this field , including three radio - weak agn , have spectroscopic redshifts z near 2.4 ( pascarelle et al .  1996a ; pascarelle et al .",

    "ly@xmath17 filter indicates the presence of a number of other compact galaxy candidates with redshifts near 2.4 .",
    "the vla image of this field reached a limiting flux density of only @xmath6jy , but provides improved statistics for radio sources above this level .",
    "in @xmath182 of this paper we describe the vla observations , calibrations and imaging for the two fields .",
    "the radio and optical parameters for the sources are given in @xmath183 , and detailed radio / optical images with discussions are given in @xmath184 , along with discussions of the identifications .",
    "in addition , using data from five deep 8.4-ghz surveys , we discuss the spectral properties , the source density and the optical properties of the micro - jansky radio sources .",
    "further discussion is given in the final section .",
    "the sa13 field was selected from among the hst medium deep survey fields to be devoid of strong radio sources , which would limit the sensitivity of a deep radio survey .",
    "this field , centered at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , epoch j2000 , was observed with the vla for a total of 190 hours , of which we obtained 159 hours of good data ( more detail given below ) .",
    "these data included 84 hours in the most compact d - configuration ( maximum baseline 1 km ) observed between 1993 october and 1994 january , and 75 hours in the c - configuration ( maximum baseline 3 km ) observed between 1994 november and 1995 january .",
    "the earlier discussion in paper i of the optical counterparts in this field was based on the 1993/1994 d - configuration observations , but with the preliminary new c - configuration data .",
    "the hercules field was observed for 12 hours in the vla c - configuration in 1996 february .",
    "the center of this field is at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , epoch j2000 .",
    "the observations were made at two frequencies , 8.415 ghz and 8.465 ghz , each with dual circular polarization with a bandwidth of 50 mhz . at this frequency the full - width half - power ( fwhp ) beamwidth of the vla 25-m antennas is @xmath23 .",
    "we examined the area out to the 8% power level , at a radius of @xmath24 from the field center .",
    "this corresponds to a solid angle of @xmath25 sr for each field .",
    "each observing session lasted 8 - 10 hours and was split into 30-minute segments which included 27 minutes on the survey field and 3 minutes on a nearby calibrator source .",
    "for the sa13 field , we used the unresolved calibrator source , j1244 + 4806 ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; j2000 ) , and for the hercules field , the calibrator source j1658 + 4749 ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; j2000 ) .",
    "the position grids for the surveys are tied to these calibrators , both of which have a position known to better than @xmath30 .",
    "the amplitude calibration was derived from observations of 3c286 made once per day ; we assumed a flux density of 5.19 jy at 8.44 ghz .",
    "the data from each observing session were edited for occasional short periods of interference , excessive noise in individual correlators or other technical problems , antenna shadowing , and inclement weather conditions . in the sa13 field ,",
    "less than one percent of the data was lost to interference and technical problems , but we had to discard about 30 hours of data due to poor weather , primarily snow , during 4 of the 27 observing sessions , each of 6 to 8 hours duration .",
    "both fields were imaged and deconvolved with the aips tasks imagr using a pixel separation @xmath31 over a field of view of @xmath32 in order to detect radio sources well outside of the primary beam field of view which could seriously affect the image quality @xcite .",
    "the visibility data were weighted ( aips terminology of robust=1 ) to obtain high signal to noise with low sidelobe levels and good resolution . for the sa13 field which contained both c and d configuration data ,",
    "the full - width at half - power ( fwhp ) resolution was @xmath33 .",
    "we also made an image with a resolution of @xmath34 to help resolve possible source blends .",
    "for the hercules field with only c - configuration data , the resolution was @xmath35 .",
    "the measured rms noise in the sa13 field was @xmath2jy , which makes this the most sensitive radio image yet obtained .",
    "for the hercules field the rms noise was @xmath36jy .",
    "the strongest source in the sa13 field has a measured map flux density of @xmath37jy .",
    "this is less than one hundred times the thermal receiver noise limit , so dynamic range limitations are not an important factor . the hercules field contained a known ` bright ' radio source of 6 mjy at the field center , 53w002 @xcite , which was the target of the deep hst study @xcite .",
    "artifacts from the 6-mjy source limited the dynamic range of the image , but self - calibration with a solution interval of 3 min had sufficient signal to noise to improve the calibration , and produce an image was signal - to - noise limited    the completeness limit of a survey is that level above which there is near certainty that any source is real .",
    "as discussed in previous vla papers on radio surveys with comparable resolution , crowdedness and field of view , a source with a peak flux density on the image @xmath38-@xmath16 has a probability of @xmath39 of being a true detection @xcite .",
    "this percentage includes the effects of receiver noise and side - lobe contamination from faint sources .",
    "the most negative peak flux density on the image is also a good indication of the detection limit @xcite .",
    "we found that detection levels of @xmath3jy and @xmath40jy level for the sa13 and hercules fields , respectively , met both of the above criteria .",
    "we also confirmed 19 of the 20 sources detected in paper i using similar criteria . in order to search for possible extended radio sources with low surface brightness",
    ", we convolved the images to @xmath41 resolution for sources above the detection level of the highest resolution image , but above that for a lower resolution image .",
    "one such extended source was found in the sa13 field ( source 27 in table 1 ) .",
    "the radio images for the entire sa13 and the hercules fields are shown in figures 1 and 2 , respectively . in figure 3",
    "we show the image of the central part of the sa13 field where the radio sensitivity is greatest .",
    "the figure shows the excellent quality of the radio image , the precise alignment of most of the radio / optical identifications and the obvious faintness of the identifications for some of the sources .",
    "the sources labeled with a number are given in table 1 .",
    "seven weaker radio sources which are coincident with an optical object are labeled with a letter and given at the end of table 1 .",
    "parameters for the 50 sources labeled in the sa13 field and the 10 sources labeled in the hercules field have entries listed in tables 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "thirty - four sources in the sa13 field were found in the complete sample with a peak flux density greater than @xmath3jy and within @xmath24 of the field center where the sensitivity drops to 8% of the on - axis sensitivity .",
    "sixteen additional sources , not in the complete sample , are also included in the table .",
    "all instrumental and resolution effects used to obtain the source parameters have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "table 1 is organized as follows : columns 1 and 2 show the source numbers used in this paper and in paper i , respectively , to identify the sources more conveniently .",
    "column 3 gives the source name .",
    "an asterisk before the name indicates the fifteen sources which are * not * in the complete sample .",
    "column 4 shows the total sky flux density and error estimate after correction for all instrumental and resolution effects including the primary beam attenuation of the telescopes .",
    "column 5 shows the signal - to - noise on the @xmath33-resolution image and column 6 gives the deconvolved source angular size or limit in arcseconds .",
    "the right ascension and declination , with rms errors are given in columns 7 and 8 , respectively .",
    "the remaining four columns list the optical identification type and integrated magnitude in three bands .",
    "further descriptions of the optical data are given in the next section .",
    "eight faint radio sources , which are below our formal completeness level but have probable identifications with optical counterparts , are listed at the end of table 1 , and labeled @xmath42 through @xmath43 .",
    "the probability that these radio sources is real is less than 30% based on the radio flux density alone .",
    "however , their near coincidence with an optical counterpart increases their reality to 80% ; hence , only one of the eight sources is likely to be bogus @xcite .",
    "there is good agreement between the source list in table 1 and that in paper i based on about one - half as much data , and at lower resolution . of the 20 sources above the previous detection level of @xmath44jy , 16 are in the complete sample of table 1 .",
    "the four remaining sources from paper i are just below our @xmath3jy completion limit ; three of these objects are identified with galaxies .",
    "the source list for the hercules field is given in table 2 .",
    "the resolution is @xmath35 and the completeness limit is @xmath6jy .",
    "ten sources are listed ; six of these are in the complete sample .",
    "columns 1 through 7 are similar in content to that in table 1 . only two of the radio sources have been identified from an hst image which have been described elsewhere @xcite ; the optical information is given in column 8 .",
    "the identification of radio sources in the sa13 field is based on two sets of optical material .",
    "the hst - mds wf / pc images  observed with two filters : v - band ( 5420 ) and i - band ( 8920 ) , respectively  were used for the identification of radio sources near the center of the sa13 radio field . the calibration and processing of this optical data",
    "was discussed in paper i. the identification limits are v=26.8 mag and i=25.8 mag with fwhp resolution of @xmath45 . for radio sources outside the mds field of view , identifications were made with the kpno 4-m telescopes with b - band ( 4420 ) and i - band ( 8920 ) filters .",
    "the limiting magnitudes here were b=26.0 and i=25.5 mag , with seeing of about fwhm @xmath46 .",
    "the observational details are discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the i - magnitude scale of the kpno images was calibrated to agree with that of the mds , with an estimated error of 0.2 mag .",
    "the b - magnitude scale of the kpno images were calibrated using the extrapolation of the mds i- and v - magnitude scale , assuming a power law extrapolation of the intensity of the the flat - spectrum ( blue ) objects .",
    "this extrapolation is accurate to an estimated error of 0.4 mag .",
    "the precise registration of the kpno and the mds images with the radio grid was determined from the alignment of the high quality radio / optical coincidences to an accuracy of @xmath45 . only zero and first order corrections to the optical image were needed .",
    "confidence in the registration of the images at this accuracy is important for the proper interpretation of the identifications .",
    "the integrated optical magnitudes for all identifications in the sa13 field are given in table 1 .",
    "the galaxy type is given in column 9 and the b- , v- and i - magnitudes are given in columns 10 , 11 and 12 , respectively .",
    "the galaxy types are : g = galaxy of unknown morphology ; g?=uncertain identification of a very faint object ; ef = empty field ; g / b = binary galaxies or closely spaced galaxies , with the magnitude given for the objects containing the radio emission ; q = quasar : ell = elliptical galaxy ; sp = spiral galaxy .    in figures 4a and",
    "4b we show postage - stamp plots for all 42 radio sources in the sa13 field listed in table 1 .",
    "in contrast to figure 3 , the green contour lines in figures 4a and 4b show the optical i - band distribution , while the location of the position of the radio source is indicated by the small black ellipses in each plot .",
    "each field is @xmath47 on a side and centered at the position of the radio source .",

    "the last column indicates the detection of x - ray emission from the sources in the hubble and sa13 fields @xcite      accurate spectral indices of the 89 sources have been determined by comparing our results to observations at frequencies lower than 8.4 ghz ( see references at the end of table 3 ) .",

    "there is no significant difference between the two distributions . in the total distribution , the spectral range of the seven sources which were not detected above twice the 1.4-ghz noise level upper limits on the spectral index , are indicated by the arrows in the histogram .",
    "since the observations at the various frequencies were made at different times , source variability could affect the spectral index calculation , but variability of micro - jansky sources is not common @xcite .",
    "about one - quarter of the sources have a spectral index in the range @xmath64 .",
    "the distribution drops precipitously at lower spectral indices ( steeper spectra ) , but more slowly for high spectral indices ( flatter spectra ) .",
    "the median value is about @xmath65 .",
    "only a few objects have an inverted spectral index with @xmath66 , although some sources with only a 1.4 ghz flux density upper limit could fall in this category .",

    "the likelihood that the distribution of two samples chosen randomly would differ by at least this much is only 18% .",

    "19 galaxies are significantly reddened and their spectral index distribution is also shown .",
    "the slight difference in the radio spectral index between the two groups suggests that fewer of reddened objects have a flat spectrum .",
    "this trend was also found from vla observations at 5 ghz and 1.4 ghz and from the canadian - france redshift survey @xcite .",
    "this correlation , although weaker than that in figure 5c , is compatible since reddened objects would tend to have relatively faint i - band emission .",
    "nine of the sources in table 4 are identified with x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "two are in the sa13 field .",
    "in contrast , seven x - ray identifications have been made in the hubble field and these associations show no trends in radio spectral index or optical counterpart , and are identified with galaxies of various types .",
    "the density of sources ( source count ) is generally specified as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of sources per solid angle per flux density interval @xmath74 at a flux density @xmath75 . for a flat space which",
    "is uniformly filled with radio sources and ignoring the attenuation effects of redshift , the slope @xmath76 . in order to determine the two parameters , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , from the 89 source sample determined from five surveys with different sensitivities",
    ", we used a modification of the maximum likelihood method ( mlm ) originally developed for a uniformly obtained sample @xcite .",
    "for a range of test models , we chose reasonable parameters , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and calculated the relative probability that this model would produce the observed flux density distribution of the 89 sources , using the appropriate constraints for each survey .",
    "the best fit model was the one with the highest probability , and the error estimate was determined by the set of models that were at least 37% ( 1/e ) as likely as the best model .",
    "the number of micro - jansky sources , @xmath73 ( arcmin@xmath79jy@xmath80 ) , is given by    @xmath81    the corresponding integral count , @xmath82 ( arcmin@xmath83 is    @xmath84    where n is the number of sources above a flux density @xmath75 in micro - jansky . the value , 40 @xmath9jy , is the mean flux density of the sources , and in this form , the two parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 are nearly orthogonal . above @xmath85jy the source density is 0.1 ( arcmin)@xmath11 , or @xmath86 sources sr@xmath80 . at the minimum detection level of these surveys , @xmath3jy , there are 0.64 sources ( arcmin)@xmath11 , or @xmath87 sources sr@xmath80 .",
    "extrapolation to weaker flux density with the same slope gives 6 sources ( arcmin)@xmath11 above @xmath88jy , corresponding to an average source separation of @xmath89 .",
    "the density of sources is still far from the natural confusion limit when sources begin to blend with each other .",
    "if @xmath90 is the proportion of sky covered with emission , significant blending occurs for @xmath91 . if we assume an average source size of @xmath52 .",
    "then then @xmath92 . extrapolating to @xmath88jy and @xmath93jy gives @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "unless the average angular size of most sources is less than @xmath96 , radio source blending will become a problem below about @xmath97jy .",
    "recent results from merlin , however , shows that some faint radio sources contain a significant part of their emission within an angular size of @xmath4 @xcite .    the plot of the _ integral _ source count at 8.4 ghz is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the ordinate scale has been normalized to the euclidean integral slope of @xmath98 . at any point in the plot , the ordinate value times s@xmath99 gives the number of sources ( arcmin)@xmath11 with a flux density greater than @xmath100jy . the count derived from the mlm calculation ,",
    "describe above , is shown by the solid line .",
    "this line extends to @xmath88jy , although we can not exclude that the slope of the counts change below our detection limit of @xmath3jy .",
    "the plotted points at the micro - jansky levels have been obtained by gridding the data in table 4 into five flux density bins .",
    "the results of this binned data are shown in table 5 .",
    "the mlm fit is clearly compatible with the gridded data , as it should be . the number of sources in each of the five bins listed in column 4 agrees reasonably well with the number predicted by the mlm fit , given in column 5 .",
    "we have added in the count of sources at 8.4 ghz at high flux densities @xcite .",
    "there are no extensive surveys of sources at 8.4 ghz of intermediate flux density sources between one and eight milli - janskys .",
    "the source count at 8.4 ghz derived at micro - jansky levels is consistent with that at the milli - jansky and jansky levels .",
    "extrapolation of the micro - jansky count falls slightly under the milli - jansky points , the excess being produced by the rapid evolution of the brightest radio sources in the sky .",
    "the dotted line shows the best fit count obtained from the lynx and cepheus fields only @xcite which contained only 20 sources to a detection level of @xmath101jy . the ` old ' count and",
    "the ` new ' count differ at the 1.4-@xmath16 level near @xmath85jy",
    ". there may be several reasons for the discrepancy : first , the difference may be real and reflect the anisotropic distribution of sources in the sky on scales of tens of arcmin .",
    "such differences between the number of sources among radio fields have already been noted by others at various frequencies ( windhorst et al .",
    "1985 ; windhorst et al .  1993",
    "; hopkins et al .  1998 ; hopkins et al .  1999 ; richards 2000 ) .",
    "second , the optical and radio selection criteria for the various fields were not the same .",
    "the hubble and sa13 fields were deliberately selected to be radio quiet above 0.5 mjy , whereas the hercules field contained a known radio source of about 10 mjy .",
    "the optical constraints for the hdf selection ( no relatively bright objects ) may also be relevant .",
    "however , since most of the radio sources and statistics come from sources which are in the 10 to 200 @xmath9jy flux density range at 8 ghz , the systematic effect of the avoidance of radio fields with sources stronger than 500 @xmath9jy is unclear .",
    "third , the lynx and cepheus fields were observed with lower resolution than the hubble and sa13 fields .",
    "although the effects of source blending were considered for the lynx and cepheus fields @xcite , the blending may be more important than originally thought .",
    "the average angular size of the sources in these two fields were also larger than in other fields , and perhaps a consequence of the blending of weak sources .",
    "regardless of the reasons for the somewhat different count of sources in the lynx and cepheus fields , the new results are based on more than four times the number of sources found in five different areas and with higher resolution . when extrapolated to @xmath88jy ,",
    "the new counts give a density of @xmath102 ( arcmin)@xmath11 , compared with the previous value of @xmath103 ( arcmin)@xmath11 . this difference is about 1.8-@xmath16 and should not be regarded as significant .",
    "the average sky brightness at 8.4 ghz , contributed by sources with flux densities above @xmath3jy is @xmath104k . extrapolating to weaker sources",
    ", the sky brightness will increase as s@xmath105 , assuming a constant slope @xmath78 .",
    "using @xmath106 , the estimated sky brightness from discrete sources increases by only a factor of 2 for a decrease of 1000 in flux density .",
    "hence , the sky brightness at 8.4 ghz contributed by discrete sources down to the nano - jansky level is unlikely to exceed 0.001 k unless there is a new population of weaker sources , allowing the slope @xmath78 to become more negative ( i.e.  steeper ) than @xmath107 .",
    "figure 7 shows the distribution of the i - magnitudes of the 63 sources in the complete samples in the sa13 field plus the hubble deep and flanking fields . the density of sources with radio identifications and optical magnitudes between i=17.5 and 20.5 mag is about 30% of the density of all galaxies within this magnitude range @xcite . for galaxies fainter than i=20.5 mag",
    "the distribution remains relatively constant per magnitude interval to i=26.0 mag , with about 20% of the sources unidentified below this magnitude .",
    "this distribution is similar to that found in other investigations of the identification of weak radio sources @xcite .",
    "analysis of several hst fields shows that 34%@xmath1089% of all galaxies brighter than i=23.3 mag are in binary systems .",
    "this is much higher than the 7% found for the galaxy population brighter than i=15 mag , which comprise the local  population @xcite .",
    "thus , galaxy interaction appears to be a strong function of cosmological time , and such galaxy interactions may be the main cause of the strong evolution of radio sources with redshift @xcite .",
    "this connection between galaxy interaction and radio emission is supported in these data . for the complete sample of 63 radio sources in the sa13 and hubble fields ,",
    "37 are identified with galaxies brighter than i=23.3 mag .",
    "seventeen of these identifications are classified as _",
    "g / b _ meaning that at least one other galaxy lies within @xmath60 of the radio galaxy , possibly indicating galaxy interactions .",
    "thus , 46% of these radio identifications are associated with multiple systems .",
    "this percentage is somewhat larger than the 34% of galaxies that are found in multiple systems below @xmath109 mag , and suggests that the radio emission is even more snhanced by galaxy interactions .",
    "a more complete analysis of the optical properties of the radio sources in the sa13 and hubble fields is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have reported the results from two new 8.4 ghz vla surveys of micro - jansky radio sources . in one of the fields , sa13 ,",
    "the rms noise is @xmath2jy and we have detected 49 sources of which 34 are in a complete sample with a flux density above @xmath3jy .",
    "six sources were detected above @xmath6jy in the hercules field . in tables 1 and 2",
    "we present the radio catalog for these two fields .",
    "comments and a detailed radio / optical comparison are given for 42 sources in the sa13 field using deep hst and kpno images .",
    "the results from these two fields double the number of 8.4-ghz radio sources now known at micro - jansky levels .    in the second part of this paper",
    ", we have compiled a list of 89 sources in a flux density complete sample from five deep vla surveys at 8.4 ghz .",
    "this source list is dominated by observations of the sa13 field ( detection level of @xmath3jy ) and the hubble deep field plus the flanking fields ( detection level of @xmath110jy ) .",
    "we have used other optical and radio data in order to determine the properties of these weak radio sources .",
    "the count of radio sources follows an approximate power - law with a slope @xmath111 from 10 mjy to less than @xmath112jy , with good continuity to the count at the jansky level ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "there are no significant differences in the number of sources detected in each field , as shown by the comparison of columns 8 and 9 in table 3 , which indicate the number of sources detected versus the number expected from the best fit to the count .",
    "the average sky brightness temperature contributed by the micro- and nano - jansky radio sources is extrapolated to be less than 0.001 k as long as the slope @xmath78 does not become steeper than @xmath107 .",
    "most of the sources are unresolved with @xmath33 or even @xmath34 resolution .",
    "for the 63 sources in the hubble and sa13 samples , 15 sources ( 24% ) are larger than about @xmath51 , and only four sources are larger than @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the angular size of the micro - jansky sources at 8.4 ghz appears statistically somewhat smaller than the angular size at 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "the median spectral index of these 15 extended sources is @xmath113 , steeper than than our general sample and consistent with an increasing angular size with lower frequency .",
    "the correlation of large angular size with steeper spectral index is seen for all radio sources , regardless of their flux density . the combination of emission from opaque small - diameter components and large components showing an aging synchrotron ( steep ) spectrum probably cause this difference in the correlation of angular size and spectral index at the two different frequencies .",
    "higher resolution observations are needed in order to resolve the majority of the micro - jansky radio sources @xcite .",
    "the radio sources are identified with a variety of galaxy types .",
    "only two of the radio sources are identified with quasars and none with stars .",
    "we estimate that about 30% of all galaxies brighter than i=21 mag can be detected at the @xmath112jy level at 8.4 ghz . for fainter magnitudes ,",
    "the radio source identifications are spread relatively evenly , per magnitude interval , with about 20% of the radio sample fainter than i=26 mag .",
    "the centroid of the radio emission is nearly always located within @xmath4 of the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the few exceptions in the sa13 field are : j131220 + 423923 is an empty field which is displaced @xmath60 from an i=18-mag galaxy ; j131219 + 423608 contains two radio components each displaced about @xmath52 on opposite sides of a i=22 mag galaxy nucleus and is possibly a small double radio source ( see notes ) ; j131225 + 424103 is displaced @xmath52 south of an i=22 mag galaxy ( see notes ) ; j131239 + 423911 is displaced @xmath96 from the galaxy centroid , but well within the disk component .",
    "the likelihood that a micro - jansky radio source will be associated with a galaxy , between i=18 to 22 mag with at least one neighbor closer than @xmath60 , is nearly 50% .",
    "this percentage is somewhat larger than the 34% of all such galaxies which are in groups .",
    "this suggests that radio source luminosity and/or density evolution is enhanced somewhat within galaxy groups which may be interacting .",
    "the spectral index distribution of the micro - jansky radio sources at 8.4 ghz shows one clear trend ; the spectral index distribution steepens for sources below @xmath6jy ( see figure 5b ) .",
    "somewhat less conclusively , the spectral index distribution may also steepen for sources with optical counterparts fainter than i=25.5 mag ( see figure 5c ) .",
    "the change in the source count and spectral properties of radio sources fainter than 1 mjy is well - documented . below this level , star - forming galaxies begin to dominate the source population over agn .",
    "the cause for a further change in spectral properties less than @xmath6jy may be associated with the different evolution of agn and star - burst galaxies , but a definitive answer must await for additional observations of the higher energy photons emitted from these fainter radio sources , and measurement of their radio size and internal complexity .",
    "both the agn and the star - burst phenomena produce a wide range in spectral index , and can not be used as a good discriminator between the two types .",
    "a steepening of the spectral index below @xmath6jy could arise in several ways : ( 1 ) the opaque emission ( always with flat spectrum ) from agn components in weak sources may be a smaller proportion of the total emission ; ( 2 ) the star - burst phenomenon may produce steeper radio spectra for the weak sources , possibly because of synchrotron aging associated with larger magnetic fields in the weaker , distant sources .",
