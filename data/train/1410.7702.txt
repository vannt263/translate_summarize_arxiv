    "non - equilibrium dynamics of thermally isolated quantum systems has enjoyed substantial recent interest .",
    "an isolated system has no relaxation mechanism toward the low - lying parts of the many - body spectrum .",
    "thus , eigenstates far from the edges of the spectrum may be more important for a non - equilibrium experiment than the low - energy parts of the spectrum , which is the traditional focus of interest of many - body quantum theory . given this context , the properties of the _ full _ eigenspectrum of many - body interacting quantum systems has become important and of interest to a growing community .",
    "many - body eigenstates can be characterized in various ways . in connection to questions involving thermalization ,",
    "the statistical behavior of various _ local _ observables in eigenstates has been widely studied , both in non - integrable  @xcite and integrable systems  @xcite , and also in comparisons between the two cases  @xcite . in particular , the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) states that the mechanism by which non - integrable ( ` chaotic ' or ` generic ' ) systems thermalize is the smooth behavior of the eigenstate expectation values of local observables as a function of eigenenergies  @xcite .    clearly , local observables are not the only properties of many - body eigenstates that are of interest . in this work",
    ", we focus on two global characteristics of such eigenstates .",
    "the _ entanglement _ between two spatial partitions of a system is now well - appreciated as a useful characterization of quantum correlations in many - body wave functions .",
    "in addition , wave functions can be characterized by their ( inverse ) participation ratio in some basis , which quantifies the number of basis states that take part in forming this wave function , i.e. , the amount of hilbert - space delocalization in this basis .",
    "a natural choice is to use the basis of real - space configurations .",
    "the participation ratio ( pr ) in this basis provides a generalization , for many - body systems , of the concept of delocalization in single - particle physics . in recent years",
    "the pr ( or its inverse , the ipr ) in various many - body bases has been widely used to characterize delocalization in many - body hilbert spaces  @xcite , e.g. , in the context of many - body localization or in the context of eth studies .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that an eigenstate with large pr in this basis would also have large entanglement between two spatial parts of the system .    in this work ,",
    "we explore both the entanglement between nearly equal - sized real - space partitions , as measured using the ( von neumann ) entanglement entropy ( ee ) , and the pr in the basis of real - space configurations , of _ every _ eigenstate of interacting many - body systems .",
    "we show how these quantities behave in the bulk of the spectrum as opposed to the edges of the spectrum . tuning the many - body hamiltonians toward and away from integrable points ,",
    "we show how integrability affects the behavior of ee s and pr s .",
    "we explore in particular the statistical correlation between the ee s and pr s , quantifying the intuitive idea that one should be large in states where the other is large .",
    "we elucidate how this relationship is affected by the location of the eigenstates in the spectrum , and by proximity to integrability",
    ". we also show how both these quantities follow the eth , in the quantitative sense that the eigenstate - to - eigenstate fluctuations of these quantities decrease with increasing system size as a power law with the hilbert - space dimension @xmath0 , similar to the eigenstate expectation values of local observables .",
    "it is commonly thought that , in ground states and low - lying excited states of local hamiltonians , the entanglement entropy follows the so - called _ area law _",
    "@xcite , with possible logarithmic corrections , while in the bulk of the spectrum the entanglement entropy generally follows a _",
    "volume law_.   reference  @xcite has shown that , for an exactly solvable or integrable system , the bulk of the spectrum contains both area - law and volume - law eigenstates .",
    "our results in this work shed further light on this picture . in non - integrable cases ,",
    "we show the bulk to have only ` large ' entanglement entropies , close to the values achieved by random wave functions .",
    "as one approaches integrability , eigenstates emerge in the bulk , that have low entanglement entropy , comparable to that of eigenstates at the bottom or the top of the spectrum .",
    "loosely , one can identify the eigenstates with high and low entanglement with states having volume - law and area - law scalings , although unambiguous correspondence is not possible for the system sizes we are limited to with full numerical diagonalization .",
    "another interpretation of this characteristic behavior of both the pr and ee is that ` typical ' states in the bulk of the spectrum , i.e. , those that correspond to thermodynamics , have large ee and pr , and that the appearance of low - ee and low - pr states in near - integrable cases reflects the existence of large numbers of non - typical states even in the middle of spectra for integrable systems .",
    "our comparative analysis shows that the overall distributions of ee s and pr s in many - body eigenstates are very similar . in non - integrable or generic systems ,",
    "both quantities , when plotted against eigenenergies , are clustered near a sharply defined line of roughly ` inverted - parabola ' type , having small values at the edges of the spectrum and large values in the bulk of the spectrum .",
    "as one approaches integrability ( either of the zero - interaction type or of the bethe ansatz type ) , many states appear in the bulk which have lower values , so the scatter plot now takes a roughly filled - semicircle form .",
    "this appears to be a robust characterization of integrable versus non - integrable systems .",
    "an extension or application of this idea is seen in situations where the spectrum splits up into bands ( e.g. , at large interactions ) : the individual bands show one of the above two forms of scatter - plots , depending on whether or not the effective model describing the band is integrable . looking at the statistical correlations between entanglement and pr s in all eigenstates , we find that there is positive correlation , but that this correlation is generally weaker in integrable systems because of the greater variance of both observables .",
    "we show that , in the non - integrable regime , the strength of fluctuations of both quantities from eigenstate to eigenstate scales as @xmath1 with the hilbert space dimension . for the pr , this can be argued using the central limit theorem and the assumption of randomness of eigenstate coefficients .",
    "near integrability , the distributions of ee and pr values are not only wider than in the chaotic regime , but they are also skewed .",
    "we characterize the asymmetry of the distributions ; our results point to a possible universality of such distributions in integrable models .",
    "our results on the ee and pr as a function of eigenenergies provide a fundamental characterization of the distinction between integrable and non - integrable systems . in particular ,",
    "this is a way of understanding the lack of ` usual ' thermalization in integrable systems : even in the middle of the spectrum , integrable systems possess many eigenstates which are not ` typical ' and have ee s and pr s much lower than that expected of an effectively random state .",
    "the distribution of ee and pr values in the bulk of the spectrum characterizes the presence of non - typical states . as is obvious from the ` filled - semicircle ' description above",
    ", the distributions have higher variance near integrability .",
    "in addition , we find that , in the integrable region , the distributions have a definite skewness in the direction of smaller ee s and pr s .",
    "the idea of non - typical states being characterized by low entanglement entropy is increasingly appreciated  @xcite .",
    "our results offer first steps toward a more complete future understanding of the emergence of non - typical states in integrable spectra , and brings to light the usefulness of participation measures in characterizing the appearance of such non - typical states .",
    "we introduce in sec .",
    "[ sec_definitions ] the definitions of the pr and ee and the tunable families of hamiltonians we use .",

    "the interaction strength @xmath16 plays the role of tuning parameter toward and away from the free - boson integrable point at @xmath29 and the decoupled ( product state , also integrable ) limit at @xmath21 .",
    "we shift the interaction slightly at the first site in order to avoid reflection symmetry .",

    "the ee is between partitions of equal halves of the chain .",
    "the hilbert - space dimension of this system is @xmath57 .    in the small-@xmath16 regime ,",

    "we note that the dependence of pr can be regarded as a smooth function of @xmath59 plus random fluctuations , i.e. , the pr follows the eth just like local observables .",
    "this behavior will be further quantified in section  [ sec_fluctuations ] .    in the large-@xmath16 ( i.e. , atomic ) limit ,",
    "the pr is much smaller .",
    "the reason is that the eigenstates are close to the basis states in this limit , because the hopping term in the hamiltonian , which connects basis states , is negligible compared to the interaction ( @xmath16 ) term , which is diagonal in the fock basis . as a result ,",
    "the eigenstates are each dominated by a few basis states , i.e. , the pr is small .    for the ee ,",
    "we find roughly similar behavior as for the pr . in the non - integrable regime",
    ", the ee follows a smooth curve , with additional random fluctuations whose magnitudes decrease with increasing system size , consistent with the eth  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the curve  large ee s in the spectral bulk and small ee s at the spectral edges  suggests that the eigenstates have area - law character near the spectral edges and volume - law character in the spectral bulk . near the free - boson limit ( small @xmath16 )",

    ", the ee s of the states can be found in a range with a constant minimum and a maximum that depends smoothly on the energy .",

    "@xcite .    in the large-@xmath16 regime ,",
    "the ee s are generally smaller , for the same reason as explained above for the pr .",
    "the decrease does not look as drastic as in case of the pr , presumably due to the logarithmic definition of the ee .     for the bose - hubbard chain with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "we consider normalized vectors with random coefficients drawn from a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath62 , where @xmath0 is the hilbert - space dimension .",
    "this distribution resembles that of the coefficients in the middle of the spectrum of typical non - integrable systems  @xcite .",
    "for the pr , the random - state value @xmath63 is equal to @xmath64 , which follows directly from the fourth moment of the gaussian distribution .",
    "the random - state value @xmath65 of the ee is computed numerically using @xmath66 random states with gaussian - distributed coefficients .",
    "we also compare to the maximal possible values of the pr and ee .",
    "the maximal value of the pr is @xmath28 ( corresponding to the case that the state is one of the basis states ) , far larger than the typical random - state value .",
    "for the ee , however , the maximal value , the logarithm of the hilbert space dimension of the smaller partition , is only slightly larger than the random - state value . in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath67  @xcite",
    "shows that , in the chaotic ( non - integrable ) regime , the ee and pr values in the middle of the spectrum are both very close to the random - state values .",
    "this is an important quantification of the widespread idea that the eigenstates at the middle of non - integrable spectra are effectively random for many purposes .",
    "as the system size is increased , the ee and pr values are more sharply concentrated around a smooth line ( c.f .  section  [ sec_fluctuations ] ) , and this smooth line in increasingly close to the random state value .",
    "we conjecture that , in the thermodynamic limit , the ee and pr are increasingly concentrated near @xmath63 and @xmath65 . for finite sizes ,",

    "the fact that the pr and the ee s have an ` inverted - parabola ' shape within each band , indicates that the effective models describing each such energy sector ( band ) are non - integrable .",
    "this is different from the bands of the bose - hubbard chain case shown in , where each band individually has integrable forms .    as in the bose - hubbard case , near the center of the spectrum , the pr and ee reach the values close or even above the random - state expectation values",

    "integrable and generic systems are found to have characteristically different distributions of these quantities , a difference visually explicit in our scatter plots ( section [ sec_scatterplots ] ) .",
    "the main difference is the appearance of low - ee and low - pr states near integrability ; this connects to the lack of usual ` typicality ' in integrable systems , widely discussed in the context of thermalization .",
    "the fact that non - typical states are characterized by low entanglement is relatively well - known @xcite ; the present work shows that the same distinction is also encapsulated by participation measures .",
    "the ee and pr distributions are shown in the chaotic regime to become smoother ( narrower ) at the same rate as the distributions of local observables : the @xmath1 scaling can be argued through randomness assumptions for the pr but is more intricate for the ee . in the integrable regime ,",
    "the distributions are skewed toward lower values of ee or pr , due to the presence of the non - typical states .",
    "for the two systems we have studied , the skewness is near unity ( @xmath140 ) in this regime .",
    "the present work opens up several new questions for future investigations .",
    "first , the distributions at integrability should be studied more thoroughly in a larger class of integrable and near - integrable systems .",
    "while our results ( @xmath140 for two systems ) suggest that there is some type of universality in the distributions , at present we have no explanation for this behavior or understanding of the extent to which this is true for different integrable systems .",
    "the system - size limitation of full diagonalization ( and the requirement of good statistics within small energy windows ) also makes it difficult to judge the size - dependence of the distribution asymmetry .",
    "reference  @xcite has reported that the distribution of the two - site entanglement entropy is gaussian in large systems for the integrable xxx chain ; this suggests that the distribution of the ee of an @xmath141-site block might gradually acquire skewness as one increases @xmath141 to about half the system size .",
    "second , the @xmath1 scaling of the ee presumably is rooted in the central limit theorem , but we have not been able to formulate an explanation in these terms .",
    "the difficulty lies in our lack of knowledge about the scaling and distribution of the schmidt coefficients ( eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix ) , when regarded as random variables .",
    "related analyses , connecting to the density of states , appears in ref .",
    "third , one expects that the non - typical eigenstates ( states with low ee and pr ) are those where local observables deviate most from the microcanonical average value .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this has never been explicitly checked or quantified .",
    "fourth , in the context of recent activity on many - body localization where the properties of the full eigenspectrum are commonly studied , a similar study of pr and ee distributions ( perhaps as a function of proximity to the localization transition ) might be of interest . finally , for free - fermion systems , ref .",
    "@xcite provides an interpretation of the physical difference between non - typical and typical states .",
    "a generic physical understanding for general near - integrable systems is currently lacking .",
    "conversely , one could also hope for a physical understanding of why the appearance of low - pr and low - ee eigenstates is suppressed in chaotic systems ."
