    "subsequently , they were rediscovered by many famous mathematicians , including gregorio fontana , lorenzo mascheroni , pierre - simon laplace , augustin - louis cauchy , jacques binet , ernst schrder , oskar schlmilch , charles hermite and many others . because of numerous rediscoveries these numbers do not have a standard name , and in the literature they are also referred to as _",
