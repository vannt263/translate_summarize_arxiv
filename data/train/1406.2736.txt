    "the observation of long - range two - particle angular correlations on relative pseudorapidity ( @xmath2 ) in high multiplicity p+p collisions at @xmath0 = 7  tev by the cms collaboration  @xcite motivated considerable interest in searching for similar long - range correlations in other , `` elementary '' hadronic collision systems .",
    "these systems include p+pb at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and p+p and d+au at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "three independent , phenomenological analyses  @xcite of the cms correlation data from p+p collisions showed that the correlation structures , and in particular the long - range @xmath2 feature , were well described by models which included a second - order cosine - series element @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the azimuthal angles of two , arbitrary final - state hadrons .",
    "this function is an azimuthal quadrupole in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "recent measurements from the lhc experiments  @xcite found evidence of similar , long - range @xmath2 correlations in the @xmath5 = 5.02  tev p+pb collision data which increased in amplitude with increasing multiplicity .",
    "analysis by the alice collaboration  @xcite showed that this multiplicity dependent correlation structure could be accurately described with an azimuthal quadrupole .",
    "the phenix collaboration  @xcite reported similar quadrupole structure in the angular correlation data for @xmath5 = 200  gev d+au minimum - bias collisions .",
    "analysis of preliminary multiplicity dependent correlations from @xmath0 = 200  gev p+p collisions ( star collaboration  @xcite ) also obtained statistically significant evidence of a quadrupole structure which increased quadratically with multiplicity .",
    "long - range , @xmath2-independent quadrupole correlations in heavy - ion collisions have been observed for decades  @xcite .",
    "it now appears that such correlations are ubiquitous in the intermediate momentum , final - state charged hadron yields from high - energy hadronic collisions .",
    "the cms p+p correlation data also motivated theoretical interest in perturbative quantum chromo - dynamics ( pqcd ) approaches which might explain these long - range correlations .",
    "calculations based on a color - dipole model  @xcite , gluon interference from connected , multi - pomeron exchange diagrams  @xcite , and gluon interference from multiple radiating _ glasma _ flux tubes  @xcite all predicted a significant quadrupole correlation in high energy p+p and p+a ( nucleus ) collisions .",
    "quantitative descriptions of the long - range @xmath2 correlations on relative azimuth observed in the 7  tev p+p and the 5.02  tev p+pb collision data from the cms collaboration based on the glasma model were reported in  @xcite .",
    "explanations based on collective flow generated by secondary collisions between partons produced in the initial - stage of p+p and p+a collisions have also been proposed  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite levin and rezaeian showed that the bfkl pomeron description of p+p collisions in leading @xmath6 approximation , when extended into the gluon saturation kinematic region , produces long - range correlations on relative @xmath2 which display an azimuthal quadrupole structure , @xmath7 , whenever two or more pomeron exchanges occur in individual collision _",
    "events_. the produced single - gluon distribution includes a @xmath8 dependence relative to the direction of the transverse momentum exchange vector @xmath9 .",
    "the two - gluon azimuthal correlations arise from quantum interference between the soft gluons radiated from two or more parton showers which couple different pairs of initial - state partons in the colliding protons .",
    "local parton hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite can be assumed to relate the radiated , interfering gluons to the final - state hadrons .",
    "the levin and rezaeian ( lr ) bfkl  @xcite multi - pomeron model ( referred to as the lr - model in the following ) contains several unspecified parameters and includes a number of approximations .",
    "the predicted correlations depend on the number of pomeron exchanges , the multi - pomeron exchange probabilities , and the gluon saturation momentum scale @xmath10 , none of which is given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "with respect to approximations the radiated gluon densities were calculated in the small transverse momentum ( @xmath11 ) limit and expanded in powers of @xmath12 to second - order .",
    "pomeron - proton coupling was restricted to tree - level diagrams ; triple pomeron terms were omitted .",
    "integrals over transverse momentum exchange in the gluon saturation region were assumed to be dominated by the saturation scale and were approximated as described in the following .    at both the rhic and the lhc collision energies much of the inclusive particle production",
    "occurs for @xmath11 less than the expected saturation scale . as a result enhanced",
    "pomeron exchange diagrams in the saturation region ( those containing loops ) contribute to the momentum integral @xmath13  @xcite over bfkl pomeron densities , making precise calculations a challenge . using pomeron loop summation techniques  @xcite lr argued that these momentum integrals are dominated by @xmath10 .",
    "uncertainties were not provided however .",
    "integration over transverse momentum @xmath9 and the pomeron - proton interaction vertex was carried out in the lr - model for the bfkl kinematic region . in the saturation region",
    "this integral was assumed to be dominated by @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting range of values for quantity @xmath14 in @xcite provides a liberal estimate of its uncertainty .    in this work estimates of the pomeron exchange probabilities and @xmath10 , including uncertainties , are provided for 200  gev p+p collision data from the star collaboration  @xcite and the high multiplicity 7  tev p+p collision data from the cms collaboration  @xcite . because of the restriction to low-@xmath11 , the lr - model is only compared to the inclusive , @xmath11-integral correlation data .",
    "the primary goal of this analysis is to determine if the lr - model with its assumptions and uncertainties summarized above , plus the parameters obtained here , can be falsified by the quadrupole correlation measurements for p+p collisions at the rhic and the lhc and , if so , is the present application of the lr - model falsified .",
