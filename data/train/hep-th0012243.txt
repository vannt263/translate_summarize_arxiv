    "@xmath0    it is well known that different types of topological defects may have been created in the early universe after the planck time by the vacuum phase transition@xcite .",
    "these include domain walls , cosmic strings and monopoles . among them",
    "cosmic string and monopole seem to be the best candidates to be detected .",
    "a global monopole is a heavy object formed in the phase transition of a system composed by a self - coupling scalar field triplet @xmath1 , whose original global @xmath2 symmetry is spontaneously broken to u(1 ) .",
    "the simplest model which gives rise to a global monopole , was presented by barriola and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "the gravitational effects produced by this object may be approximated by a solid angle deficit in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime whose line element is given by @xmath3 here the parameter @xmath4 is smaller than unity and depends on the energy scale @xmath5 where the global symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of this monopole has a diagonal form and reads : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the non - trivial topology of this spacetime implies that the renormalized vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath8 , associated with an arbitrary collection of conformal massless quantum fields should not vanish@xcite .",
    "the explicit calculations for the massless scalar @xcite and fermionic@xcite fields have been already obtained .    in the framework of the quantum field theory at finite temperature ,",
    "the fundamental quantity is the thermal green function , @xmath9 . for the scalar field",
    "it should be periodic in the imaginary time with period @xmath10 , which is proportional to the inverse of the temperature . because we are interested to obtain the thermal green function , it is convenient to work in the euclidean analytic continuation of the green function performing a wick rotation .",
    "so , we shall work on the euclidean version of the monopole metric , @xmath11 where we have absorbed the @xmath12-parameter redefining the euclidean temporal coordinate .",
    "the main objectives of this paper are to study the effects produced by the temperature on the renormalized vev of the square of the massless scalar field operator and the respective energy - momentum tensor in the spacetime defined by ( [ metric_emono ] ) . in order to do that",
    ", we calculate first the respective euclidean thermal green function in this manifold , which is the most relevant quantity for the obtaining of these expressions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we obtain the euclidean thermal green function @xmath9 adopting the imaginary - time approach@xcite , using the schwinger - de witt formalism for a massless scalar field . in section 3",
    ", we calculate the renormalized thermal average value @xmath13 . because this term can not be written in a closed form , its dependence on the temperature is not evident .",
    "so , in order to obtain some quantitative information about its behavior , we have to proceed a numerical evaluation . in section 4",
    ", we present a formal expression for the thermal average of the zero - zero component of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath14 .",
    "again , because of its complicated dependence on the temperature , only numerical calculations enable us to present its appropriate behavior . in section 5",
    ", we present our conclusions and remarks about this paper .",
    "finally , we left for the appendix some details of our numerical calculations .",
    "@xmath15    the euclidean green function associated with a massless scalar field in the global monopole spacetime has been obtained by mazzitelli and lousto a few years ago@xcite .",
    "there this green function was obtained assuming a non - minimal coupling between the field and the geometry through the scalar curvature , @xmath16 , of this spacetime .    in this section",
    "we extend this result to obtain the euclidean green function at finite temperature in the monopole spacetime defined by ( [ metric_emono ] ) .",
    "the thermal green function , @xmath9 , must obey the non - homogeneous klein - gordon differential equation , and be periodic in the `` euclidean '' time @xmath17 with a period @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath20 the absolute temperature . considering the non - minimal coupling , the scalar green function must obey the differential equation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the covariant dalambertian operator in the metric defined by ( [ metric_emono ] ) , @xmath23 is an arbitrary coupling constant and @xmath24 is the bidensity dirac distribution .    because our spacetime is an ultrastatic one and @xmath25 hold . ] , the euclidean thermal green function can be obtained by the schwinger - de witt formalism as follows : @xmath26 where the thermal heat kernel , @xmath27 , obeys the equation @xmath28 is subject to the boudary condition @xmath29 and periodic in the euclidean time with period @xmath10 .    following the prescription given in the papers by braden@xcite and page@xcite",
    ", the thermal heat kernel can be expressed in terms of the sum @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the `` euclidean '' time unit vector .",
    "the zero temperature heat kernel , @xmath32 , in this spacetime , can be factorized as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 obey , respectively , the differential equations : @xmath36 and @xmath37 here the covariant spatial laplace operator has the form @xmath38 @xmath39 is the square of the flat - space angular momentum operator .",
    "also , as was poited out in @xcite , the heat kernel can be expressed in terms of the eingenfunctions of the operators @xmath40 as @xmath41 @xmath42 is the corresponding positively defined eigenvalues . writing @xmath43 we get in our metrical spacetime the following results : @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the spherical harmonics , @xmath47 the bessel functions and @xmath48 .",
    "so , according to ( [ hk ] ) our zero temperature heat kernel is given by @xmath49 where we have used the addition theorem for the spherical harmonics , with @xmath50 satisfying the well known relation with the original angles @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in ( [ hk_infty ] )",
    "@xmath53 is the modified bessel function .    comparing ( [ hk_infty ] ) with ( [ hk_t=0 ] )",
    "we can identify @xmath54 and @xmath55    now we want to call attention for the fact that for @xmath56 , @xmath57 become equal to @xmath58 and it is possible to get a closed expression for the sum in ( [ k3 ] ) @xcite , getting the ordinary heat kernel function for the flat - space case @xmath59    now we are in position to calculate the heat kernel function at non - zero temperature in the global monopole spacetime . according to ( [ hk_sum])-([hk_k1 ] ) only @xmath34 will be affected by temperature , so we get @xmath60    combining eqs .",
    "( [ k1beta ] ) and ( [ k3 ] ) , we have @xmath27 and consequently our thermal green function , @xmath9 , using ( [ green_sdw ] ) . our result is :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( unfortunately it is not possible to write this thermal green function in terms of a single special function . )    our temperature independent green function @xmath64 coincides , up to a redefinition of the `` euclidean '' time @xmath17 by @xmath65 , with the green function for a massless scalar field at zero temperature given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the case @xmath56 , eq .",
    "( [ gbeta ] ) provides @xmath66 from the expression above it is possible to obtain its zero - temperature limit , taking @xmath67 . in this limit",
    "we get the ordinary euclidean green function given in the literature : @xmath68",

    "so , in order to obtain a well defined value for @xmath13 , we extended to our thermal problem the renormalization procedure given in ref .",
    "@xcite : we subtract from the complete thermal green function the hadamard function , @xmath73 , which is given in terms of the square of the biscalar geodesic interval , @xmath74 .",

    "we compute the thermal contribution for the square of the scalar field operator up to the first order in the parameter @xmath79 like in@xcite : @xmath80 in order to do that let us take the integral representation for the legendre function@xcite @xmath81 substituting this expression in ( [ phi-2 ] ) , it is possible to proceed the summation on the angular quantum number , by using the expansion for @xmath57 , @xmath82 after some other intermediate steps we obtain @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 with the notation @xmath86 .",
    "unfortunately it was not possible to obtain an explicit result for both integrals above in terms of elementary or special functions .",

    "the results were developed in the high temperature , or large distance limit , @xmath89 .",

    "from these results we can see that the most relevant contribution to @xmath99 is given by the term independent on parameter @xmath23 .",
    "it is , approximately , proportional to @xmath100 and consequently independent of the distance from the point to the global monopole .",
    "@xmath0    the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath101 , is a bilinear function of the fields , so we can evaluate its vacuum expectation value , @xmath102 , by the standard method using the green s function . the thermal vacuum average , consequently , can also be obtained using the thermal green function .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the general structure of the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor associated with a massless scalar field in the global monopole spacetime at zero temperature is presented .",
