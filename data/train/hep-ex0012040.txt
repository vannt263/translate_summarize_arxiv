    "since the invention of geiger counters , the simplicity of proportional tubes has been attractive . however , the inhomogeneous electric field @xmath0 poses a problem for accurate spatial measurements because the drift velocities depend on electric field @xcite .",
    "this means a complicated relation between the measured time and the radius inferred for reconstruction .",
    "a linear relation with small correction provides accurate tracking and was previously achieved by mixtures with methane @xcite .",
    "the search for an optimized drift gas will be discussed in terms of the atlas monitored drift tube ( mdt ) system , which uses 370 000 drift tubes in 1 194 chambers with an expected spatial resolution of 80 @xmath1 m @xcite . while the originally proposed gas mixture ar : ch@xmath2:n@xmath3 ( 91:5:4)% met this resolution requirement , it was found that mixtures with hydrocarbon admixtures such as methane are prone to ageing @xcite .",
    "the mixture ar : co@xmath3 ( 93:7)% was subsequently used because of its resistance to ageing .    to achieve high accuracy in coordinate reconstruction , it is important to keep corrections small .",
    "this equates to having a linear space - time relation , so that the electron mean drift velocity is nearly independent of electric field . also , in large systems operating for long periods of time , the drift gas must have high tolerance for cumulative contamination by nitrogen from air , whereas oxygen is usually removed by purifiers .",
    "surprisingly , the effects of small amounts of nitrogen are significant @xcite , but can be used advantageously by using nitrogen as an intentional admixture in the gas mixture @xcite .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : space - time ] , the space - time relation for the original atlas mixture ar : ch@xmath2:n@xmath3 ( 91:5:4)% is very linear unlike the relation for the current test mixture of ar : co@xmath3 ( 93:7)% .",
    "= 3.5 in    knowledge of properties of electron drift in gaseous detectors @xcite will allow for a systematic search for a gas mixture which improves coordinate accuracy . to avoid ageing , it is important to find a mixture with a linear space - time relation which does not include a hydrocarbon mixture .",
    "to determine the principle features of the gases without distortion from the cylindrical geometry , a setup with uniform electric and magnetic fields is chosen ( see @xcite for a more complete description ) .",
    "the setup consists of a drift chamber in the field of the former mit cyclotron magnet .",
    "a nitrogen laser produces ionization at @xmath4 in the chamber .",
    "the electrons drift under the influence of a uniform electric field through a wire mesh and into a proportional chamber as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : side ] . displacing the laser by @xmath5 with a mirror , the velocity parallel to the electric field",
    "@xmath6 is obtained .",
    "the deflection by the magnetic field is calculated from the `` center of gravity '' of charge induced on pick - up strips behind the wires as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : top ] .",
    "differential measurements eliminate the influence of the amplification gap on the measured times .",
    "the magnet can produce fields from @xmath7 t with @xmath8 homogeneity over the chamber volume .",
    "the chamber has a thick quartz window and can reliably hold pressures to 3 bar , as well as be pumped down to 0 bar absolute pressure before a measurement .",
    "to establish regularities and simplify scaling laws , electron drift velocities and magnetic deflection angles were measured in a low admixture argon gas p10 , ar : ch@xmath2 ( 90:10)% , for different drift electric fields , magnetic fields , and pressures as shown in figs .  [ fig : p10_data ] .    for relatively small magnetic field values , the total drift velocity @xmath9 will be approximately constant .",
    "hence , we expect @xmath10 which is verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : vbscale ] .",
    "similarly , because the lorentz force is proportional to the magnetic field , the scaling for the magnetic deflection angles is expected to be @xmath11 as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : abscale ] .    for different pressures @xmath12 ,",
    "one expects a behavior governed by the mean free path of electrons in the gas , @xmath13 , and therefore scaling with @xmath14 as verified in figs .",
    "[ fig : pscale ] .",
    "[ fig : arco2_data ] displays the drift features of ar : co@xmath3 ( 93:7)% measured in our setup at 3 bar .",
    "the non - linearity of the corresponding space - time relation in fig .",
    "[ fig : arco2_rt ] is a result of the change of drift velocity close to the drift tube wall , in the @xmath15 kv / cm range .",
    "these low velocities are responsible for long times at large radius .    the improvement of the ar : co@xmath3 ( 93:7)% mixture is based on considering the electron - gas interaction cross - sections of admixture gases ( figs .",
    "[ fig : xsecs ] ) . due to quantum mechanical effects , these cross - sections are a function of energy .",
    "for example , the cross - section of argon has a minimum at about 0.23 ev , meaning that when electrons have this energy , they interact less strongly with the ar atoms .",
    "this explains the maximum in drift velocity of gas mixtures containing argon ( figs .",
    "[ fig : p10_data ] ) .",
    "carbon dioxide has a large inelastic cross - section at low energy which tends to keep the mean electron energy low and around that of the argon cross - section minimum @xcite .",
    "this strongly increases non - linearity , but the smaller average time between collisions leads to smaller angles .    to obtain a more constant electron velocity at low electric field , the amount of carbon dioxide was reduced .",
    "the addition of nitrogen to a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide was advantageous at higher electric fields because nitrogen has a large elastic cross - section .",
    "this helps to diminish the effect of the minimum in the argon cross - section ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n2_xsec ] ) .",
    "thus , the addition of nitrogen should flatten the drift velocity curve and straighten the space - time relation .",
    "the negative effect is a modest increase in deflection angle .",
    "the data in figs .  [ fig : goodgases ] demonstrate the predicted features from the discussion above . figs .",
    "[ fig:94_2_4_dat ]  and  [ fig:92_6_2_dat ] show mixtures which do not contain any hydrocarbon admixture .",
    "the magnetic deflection angles @xmath16 are slightly higher than the angles in fig .",
    "[ fig : arco2_data ] but the velocities lead to much better space - time curves as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig:94_2_4_rt ]  and  [ fig:92_6_2_rt ] by adapting the measured data to a cylindrical geometry .",
    "to see the benefits of a linear drift gas , a simple model consisting of a two - layer set of drift tubes is considered ( fig .  [ fig:2tubes ] ) .",
    "muon track 1 is the actual path of the muon , but due to non - linearities in the space - time relation of the gas , this track will be incorrectly reconstructed . at 60@xmath17 from vertical , muon track 2 is also affected by these non - linearities .",
    "[ fig:3tubes ] shows the systematic errors when three layers of drift tubes are used .",
    "the third layer helps to pull the reconstructed muon track 1 back to vertical , but the reconstructed muon track 2 continues to suffer from the incorrectly predicted radii . using the space - time curves from figs .",
    "[ fig : arco2_rt ] ,  [ fig:94_2_4_rt ] ,  and  [ fig:92_6_2_rt ] , horizontal deviations in the muon track reconstruction were calculated for muons impinging vertically and at 60@xmath17 from vertical .",
    "these errors are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : errors ] .",
    "it is clear that the reconstruction error in a gas is strongly related to the linearity of its space - time relation .",
    "we show that simple relations can be used to scale mean drift velocity and magnetic deflection angle data for magnetic fields @xmath18 1.2 t and pressures @xmath18 3 bar .",
    "transforming measured data in homogenous fields to a cylindrical geometry lead to a gas mixture with a nearly linear space - time relation .",
    "with knowledge of gas admixtures , definite improvements over the present atlas mdt test mixture ar : co@xmath3 ( 93:7)% were found",
    ". ar : n@xmath3:co@xmath3 ( 94:2:4)% gives roughly a factor three improvement and ar : n@xmath3:co@xmath3 ( 92:6:2)% has an order of magnitude smaller corrections and may provide a chance to improve accuracy in the large atlas detector .",
