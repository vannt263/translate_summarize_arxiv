    "coupling a 3d fluid flow model and a system of hyperbolic equations posed on a 1d graph is a well established approach for numerical simulations of blood flows in a system of vessels  @xcite .",
    "such a geometric multiscale strategy is particularly efficient , when the attention to local flow details and the qualitative assessment of global flow statistics are both important .",
    "the relevance to cardiovascular simulations and challenging mathematical problems of coupling parabolic 3d and hyperbolic 1d equations put 3d1d flow problems in the focus of intensive research .",
    "thus , the coupling of a 3d fluid / structure interaction problem with a reduced 1d model merged to outflow boundary , which acts as an absorbing device , was studied in @xcite .",
    "the coupling of a 3d fluid problem with multiple downstream 1d models in the context of a finite element method was considered in @xcite . in @xcite , a system of a 3d fluid / structure interaction problem and a 1d finite element method model of the whole arterial tree",
    "was implemented to model the carotid artery blood flow ; and in @xcite a unified variational formulation for multidimensional models was introduced .",
    "a splitting method , extending the pressure - correction scheme to 3d1d coupled systems , was studied in @xcite .    in most of these studies ,",
    "the 3d model was a generic fluid - elasticity or rigid fluid model , while numerical validations were commonly done for cylindric type 3d domains ( with rigid or elastic walls ) ; several authors considered geometries with bifurcation  @xcite or constrained geometries ( modeling a stenosed artery ) @xcite .",
    "more complicated geometries occur in simulations of blood flows , if one is interested in modeling the effect of endovascular implants , such as inferior vena cava ( ivc ) filters . in numerical simulations ,",
    "a part of a vessel with an intravenous filter leads to the computational 3d domain with strongly anisotropic inclusions .",
    "a downstream flow behind the implant may exhibit a complex structure with traveling vortices , swirls , and recirculation regions ( the latter may occur if plaque is captured by the filter ) .",
    "moreover , the ivc flow is strongly influenced by the contraction of the heart , and both forward ( towards the heart ) and reverse ( from the heart ) flows occur within one cardiac cycle .",
    "downstream coupling conditions for such flows may be a delicate issue .",
    "thus , the flow over an ivc filter is an interesting and challenging problem for a 3d-1d flow numerical solver .",
    "the coupling conditions of 3d and 1d fluid models and their properties were studied by several authors .",
    "coupling conditions and algorithms based on subdomain iterations were introduced in @xcite , and the stability properties of each subproblem were analyzed separately .",
    "the first analysis of two models together was done in @xcite . in that paper , it was noted that if the navier - stokes equations are taken in the rotation form and suitably coupled with a 1d downstream flow model , then one can show a bound for the joint energy of the system .",
    "it is , however , well known that using a finite element method for the rotation form of the navier - stokes equations needs special care  @xcite , and setting appropriate outflow boundary conditions can be an issue . in the present paper",
    ", we introduce an _ energy consistent _ coupling with a 1d model for the convection form of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the joint energy of a coupled 3d-1d model is appropriately balanced and dissipates for viscous flows .",
    "handling highly anisotropic structures is a well - known challenge in numerical flow simulations and analysis .",
    "there are only a few computational studies addressing the dynamics of blood flows in vessels with implanted filters .",
    "recently , vassilevski et al .  @xcite numerically approached the problem of intravenous filter optimization using a finite - difference method on octree cartesian meshes to resolve the geometry of implants . in that paper , it was also discussed how the effect of an implant can be accounted in a 1d model through a modification of a vessel wall state equation ( see also @xcite for the development of this method for atherosclerotic blood vessels ) . in the present paper , we take another approach and locally resolve the full 3d model , while keeping the state equation unchanged .",
    "we report on a finite element method for modeling a 3d-1d coupled fluid problem , when the 3d domain has anisotropic inclusions .",
    "naturally , this leads to meshes containing possibly anisotropic tetrahedra .",
    "we study the performance of the finite element method both by considering the accuracy of solutions and by monitoring the convergence of one state - of - the - art linear algebra solver for the systems of linear algebraic equations to be solved on every time step of the method .",
    "we are interested in the ability of the solver to predict such important statistics as the drag force experienced by an intravenous implant .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s_model ] ,",
    "we review 3d and 1d fluid models and discuss coupling conditions .",
    "the stability properties of the coupled model are also addressed in section  [ s_model ] .",
    "section  [ s_solver ] presents a time - stepping numerical scheme and an algebraic solver . in section  [ s_validate ]",
    ", we validate the 3d finite element solver and the coupled method by considering the benchmark problem of a flow past a 3d cylinder and a problem with an analytical solution .",
    "the application of the method to simulate a blood flow over a model ivc filter is given in section  [ s_filter ] .",
    "numerical experiments were performed using the ani3d finite element package  @xcite , which was used to generate tetrahedra subdivisions of 3d domains , to build stiffness matrices , and to implement the linear algebra solvers described in section  [ s_solver ] .",
    "this section reviews 3d and 1d fluid models and describes the coupling of the models . in this study ,",
    "the 3d model is assumed ` rigid ' .",
    "consider a flow of a viscous incompressible newtonian fluid in a bounded domain @xmath0 .",
    "we shall distinguish between the inflow part of the boundary , @xmath1 , the no - slip and no - penetration part ( rigid walls ) , @xmath2 , and the outflow part of the boundary , @xmath3 . on the inflow part",
    "we assume a given velocity profile .",
    "the outflow boundary conditions are defined by setting the normal stress tensor equal to a given vector function @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the 3d model is the classical navier - stokes equations in pressure - velocity variables : @xmath5 { \\operatorname{div}}{\\bf u } & = 0   \\end{split}&\\quad { \\rm in}~\\omega\\times(0,t ] , \\\\ { \\mathbf{u}}|_{\\gamma_{\\rm in } } = { \\mathbf{u}}_{\\rm in},\\quad{\\mathbf{u}}|_{\\gamma_{0 } } = { \\bf 0}&,\\\\ \\left.\\left(\\nu\\frac{\\partial{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial{\\mathbf{n}}}-p{\\mathbf{n}}\\right)\\right|_{\\gamma_{\\rm out}}=\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\phi$\\unboldmath}&. \\end{split } \\right.\\ ] ] here @xmath6 is the outward normal vector to @xmath7 .",
    "the system is also supplemented with initial condition @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) for @xmath10 in @xmath11 .",
    "we remark that the notion of ` inflow ' and ` outflow ' boundary is used here and further in the text conventionally , since the inequalities @xmath12 or @xmath13 are _ not _ necessarily pointwise satisfied on @xmath1 or @xmath3 , respectively . in applications we consider , the mean flux , @xmath14 averaged in space _ and in time _ , is expected to be negative at @xmath1 and positive at @xmath3",
    ". however , for certain @xmath15 $ ] , the flux @xmath16 may take positive values at @xmath1 ( negative at @xmath3 ) .",
    "if the solution to is sufficiently smooth and the inflow boundary conditions are homogeneous , the following energy balance holds : @xmath17 here and in the rest of the paper , @xmath18 denotes the @xmath19 norm . if one _ assumes _ @xmath20,\\ ] ] then solutions to satisfy the _ a priori _ energy inequality and this opens possibilities for showing partial well - posedness results . even though , the assumption was used for the purpose of analysis in the literature on 3d-1d blood flow models ( see  @xcite ) , it is hard to verify for practical flows .",
    "moreover , the inequality no longer holds if reverse flows occur , as , for example , happens in ivc  @xcite .",
    "a one - dimensional model can be derived from the navier - stokes equations posed in a long axisymmetric elastic pipe by integrating over cross section , making some simplifying assumptions and considering integral average quantities as unknowns , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath21 be the cross section of the pipe normal to @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the area of @xmath21 and @xmath24 is the axial velocity .",
    "introduce the averaged variables : the mean axial velocity @xmath25 and the mean pressure : @xmath26 we consider the model given by the following system of equations for unknowns @xmath27 : @xmath28.\\ ] ] for initial conditions , the mean velocity and the cross section area are prescribed , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 is the external pressure , @xmath32 is a function modelling the source or sink of the fluid , as may be required in hemodynamic simulations , if a blood loss happens in a vessel .",
    "further , we assume @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so from now @xmath35 has the meaning of the difference between the fluid pressure and the external pressure .",
    "the term @xmath36 accounts for external forces , such as gravity or friction . following  @xcite , we set @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the viscosity coefficient",
    ", @xmath39 is the pipe diameter , @xmath40 is the reference area ( in the hemodynamic applications @xmath40 is the cross section area of a vessel at rest ) and @xmath41 the last equation in relates the pressure to the cross section area . the function @xmath42 is defined by the elasticity model of the pipe walls , @xmath43 is the elasticity model parameter .",
    "we use the one from @xcite : @xmath44 other algebraic defining relations linking the mean pressure and the cross section area are known from the literature , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "they are equally well suited for the purpose of this paper .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors derived the energy equality for the one - dimensional fluid model in @xmath45 variables , where @xmath46 is the flux . up to possibly different choices of @xmath36 and @xmath47 ,",
    "the formulation in @xcite is equivalent to . written in terms of @xmath48 , and @xmath35 ,",
    "the energy equality for is ( recall that we assumed @xmath33 ) : @xmath49 with the energy functional @xmath50 for @xmath47 given in , the second term in the definition of @xmath51 is always positive , making @xmath51 positive for all @xmath52 .",
    "the choice of @xmath36 in ensures that the second term on the left - hand side of is positive as well .",
    "thus , for the homogenous boundary conditions the energy of the 1d model dissipates : @xmath53 .",
    "system is hyperbolic and can be integrated along characteristics . to see this , we write in the divergence form : @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "denote by @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( i=1,2 ) the left eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the jacobian @xmath60 .",
    "one finds @xmath61 and @xmath62 thus , system can be written in the characteristic form : @xmath63 under physiological conditions in hemodynamics , it holds @xmath64 , implying that the eigenvalues @xmath65 have opposite signs .",
    "therefore , @xmath66 is the incoming characteristic from point @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the incoming characteristic from point @xmath69 .",
    "two boundary conditions , one at @xmath69 and one at @xmath67 , are enough to close the system .

    "we pose the 1d fluid model and in @xmath70 we pose the full three - dimensional navier - stokes equations . the one - dimensional domain @xmath71 is coupled to the downstream boundary of @xmath70",
    "there are several options to define the coupling conditions of 1d and 3d models , as discussed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "one can ask for the continuity of the mean pressure , the mean axial velocity , the flux , the normal cross section area , the averaged normal stress , or the entering characteristic . in general",
    ", the continuity of all these quantities can not be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "a choice has to be made .    one common choice , see , e.g. , @xcite , is to impose the continuity of the normal stress and the flux : @xmath72 this choice is , however , known to be energy inconsistent in the following sense .",
    "assume the homogeneous boundary conditions on @xmath1 and the downstream end of @xmath71 .",
    "then the cumulative energy balance of the coupled model is @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 is a positive coefficient defined from .",
    "easy to see that for coupling conditions  the right hand side of reduces to @xmath76 in general , it is not clear if this quantity is non - positive and thus if the cumulative energy is properly dissipated , as it holds for the full 3d navier - stokes equations with the dirichlet homogeneous boundary conditions . to circumvent this inconsistency ,",
    "it was suggested in @xcite to replace condition by the continuity of so - called total stress : @xmath77 condition together with the continuity of the flux , i.e. condition , makes the right hand side of equal to zero .",
    "hence , the cumulative energy dissipates .",
    "however , setting the total stress equal to a constant is not a consistent outflow condition for the simplest poiseuille flow .",
    "moreover , is the natural boundary condition for the _ rotation _ form of the navier - stokes equations . using it with the common convection or conservation forms leads to non - linear coupling conditions and often requires iterative treatment  @xcite .",
    "although the rotation form is an interesting alternative to the standard convection form , it is still not a standard option in the existing software and its use requires certain care @xcite .",
    "the condition for the normal stress , as in , is the natural boundary condition for the commonly used convection and conservation forms of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "such a condition has been shown to be surprisingly useful as outflow boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "thus , instead of keeping and changing to the total stress condition , we retain and instead of assume the continuity of the linear combination of the fluid flux and the energy flux : @xmath78 one easily checks that the combination of and ensures the right - hand side of equal to zero and thus the correct energy balance and energy inequality are valid as formulated in the following theorem .",
    "[ th1 ] consider the coupled 1d3d fluid problem given by , , , , and coupling conditions , .",
    "assume the homogeneous boundary conditions @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "then a sufficiently smooth solution satisfies the following energy decay property : @xmath81 for any @xmath15 $ ] . if @xmath82 is defined in , then @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath35 has the meaning of the difference between fluid and external pressures , it can be negative . in this case",
    ", more than one value of @xmath25 may satisfy . to ensure that the coupled model is not defective",
    ", one has to prescribe a particular rule for choosing the root of the cubic equation . in our numerical experiments ,",
    "we take @xmath25 which is the closest to @xmath84 .",
    "the boundary condition is the combination of fluid and energy fluxes and so it does not guarantee to conserve the ` mass ' of the entire coupled system . although , we do not observe any perceptible generation or loss of mass in our numerical experiments , it does not necessarily mean that for all problems this effect should be negligible .",
    "actually , one may consider any other linear combination of fluid and energy fluxes coupling on 3d-1d boundary to compromise between energy stability and mass conservation .",

    "hence , we now consider three domains @xmath85 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . in @xmath85 and @xmath71",
    "the simplified 1d model is posed and in @xmath70 the full three - dimensional navier - stokes equations are solved .",

    "thus , we impose the upstream coupling conditions in such a way that the 3d problem is supplied with the dirichlet inflow boundary conditions .",
    "this is a standard choice for incompressible viscous fluid flows solvers and is especially convenient if third parties or legacy codes are separately used to compute 3d and 1d solutions , and they communicate only through coupling conditions .    for the upstream boundary , @xmath86",
