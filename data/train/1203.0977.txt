    "in order to quantitatively combine and contrast data from independent telescopes and surveys , often at multiple frequencies , it is necessary to have a standard calibration scale to form comparisons .",
    "this is especially important at frequencies below 300mhz and above 15ghz where the widely used baars et  al .",
    "( 1977 ) radio flux density scale is incomplete . for the new generation of low frequency telescopes such as the low frequency array ( lofar ; van  haarlem et  al . in prep ) it is becoming increasingly necessary to provide a broadband spectral reference for initial science , so that both archival and future measurements can be quantitatively compared to these new data .",
    "in addition to an absolute scaling , such telescopes require a well - defined set of calibrators spread in right ascension ( ra ) to allow for quasi - simultaneous broadband calibration of field observations . here",
    "we present a set of parameterized models for six broadband calibrators covering frequencies from @xmath1mhz and ras from @xmath0hrs .",
    "we focus on the northern sky , and in particular on the applicability to lofar .",
    "this set of calibrators forms a flux scale that will be the basis of a major effort to develop an all - sky , broadband calibration catalog .",
    "the initial description given here will be continuously refined as new lofar data accumulate .",
    "radio interferometers operating at low frequencies face a substantial calibration challenge .",
    "strong ionospheric phase corruptions are common , especially below 100  mhz . for large - scale survey work in particular ,",
    "it is important that the processing of raw visibility data from the telescope can be automated . in order to jump - start such an automatic calibration and imaging process for any arbitrary field , a pre - existing model of the brightest sources in the field of view",
    "is required .",
    "such a model must be intrinsically frequency dependent , since modern radio telescopes are inherently broadband in nature , with tremendous fractional bandwidths .",
    "for example , lofar routinely observes from @xmath2  mhz , and is capable of observing as low as 10  mhz .",
    "over such a broad range , the flux scales must be tied to a well - understood set of reference sources with spectral energy distributions that are well understood across the full bandpass . in the case of lofar",
    ", the production of such an all - sky broadband catalog is the key goal of the multifrequency snapshot sky survey ( msss ; heald et al . in prep ) .",
    "the reference sources which form the basis of the broadband flux scale must be selected for suitability as high - quality calibration targets .",
    "several factors are relevant .",
    "first , the source should dominate the visibility function .",
    "in addition to high flux density , separation of contaminating flux from sources away from the pointing centre ( ` off - beam ' ) can be improved in two further ways ( i ) averaging in time and frequency to smear out the contributions of off - beam sources on longer baselines ; and ( ii ) the `` demixing '' technique ( van der tol et al .",
    "2007 ) , which has been adopted for use with lofar data . secondly , the source should be compact compared to the angular resolution of the instrument , to allow simple morphological calibration models .",
    "well - known sources such as cyg a and cas a have extremely complex morphologies , making calibration of an array with arcsecond angular resolution difficult .",
    "thirdly , these calibrators must be spread in right ascension ( ra ) to allow for quasi - simultaneous broadband calibration with field observations .    with these considerations in mind we searched the 3c ( edge et  al .",
    "1959 ) and revised 3c ( 3cr ; bennet et  al .",
    "1962 ) catalogues for an initial list of bright compact sources , with the criteria that ( 1 ) they must be at declinations greater than 30@xmath3 , ( 2 ) they must have a flux density at 178mhz greater than 20jy and ( 3 ) they must have an angular diameter less than 20arcseconds ( compact compared to the naturally weighted resolution of the dutch lofar array ) .",
    "\\(a ) 0.25(b ) 0.25(c ) 0.25(d )    these criteria result in an initial sample of six sources , of which we exclude one based on other data from the literature showing more substantial extension than indicated in 3cr ( 3c69 ; pooley & henbest 1974 ) and we include one additional source based on other data from the literature indicating that the extension listed in 3cr is an overestimate ( 3c286 ; e.g. pearson et  al .",
    "the final sample is listed in table  [ tab : cals ] .",
    "source extensions from 3cr are listed in column [ 5 ] for each object .",
    "we note that high resolution observations ( e.g. akujar & garrington 1995 ) confirm that the source structure in 3c48 is on sub - arcsecond scales , whilst 3c147 , 3c286 and 3c295 have structure on scales @xmath4 .",
    "3c196 has two dominant components separated by about @xmath5 , as well as complex diffuse structure with a ( precessing ) jet morphology ( reid et  al .",
    "the structure in 3c380 is known to be dominant on scales of @xmath6 , making it the most extended object in this sample ( reid et  al .",
    "the data used for spectrum fitting are listed in table  [ tab : refs ] . in order to provide a common flux scaling ,",
    "these data have been revised onto the flux scale of roger , bridle & costain ( 1973 ; hereafter rbc ) below 325mhz .",
    "this scale has been chosen to avoid the suggested issues ( e.g. rees 1990a ) with the secular decrease in the flux density of cas  a at low frequencies ( @xmath7mhz ) inherent in the widely used baars et  al .",
    "( 1977 ; b77 ) scale .    at low radio frequencies",
    "most data are tied to the rbc or kellerman , pauliny - toth & williams ( 1969 ; kpw ) scales .",
    "the correction factors for moving between these scales at @xmath8mhz are listed in table .  [",
    "tab : refs ] . at @xmath9mhz",
    "the rbc and kpw scales are in agreement and consequently such data , where calibrated on the b77 scale , are corrected using a polynomial fit to the correction factors listed in b77 onto the kpw scale .",
    "data from wenss ( rengelink et  al . 1997 ) have been corrected using an average correction factor to bring them onto the b77 scale and a further scaling to bring them onto the rbc scale .",
    "the 6c , 8c and miyun surveys are calibrated on the rbc scale in their original form , and the bologna survey ( colla et  al . 1970 ) is calibrated on the kpw scale which is consistent with the rbc at 408mhz .",
    "data from aslanyan et  al .",
    "( 1968 ) are scaled using the ratio of the stated flux densities for the calibrator sources ( 3c348 & 3c353 ) in the original paper to the predicted values at 60mhz from the spectral models for these sources in rbc .",
    "data from scott & shakeshaft ( 1971 ) are corrected onto the scale of artyukh et  al .",
    "( 1969 ) and then onto the rbc scale using the factors listed in tables  iii  &  iv of rbc , this is subject to the caveat that the difference in flux densities from 81.5 to 86mhz is assumed to be negligible compared to the uncertainty in these factors ( @xmath10per  cent ) . where applied",

    "1970a;b ) , calibrated on the gravoko scale .",
    "these data have not been used in the fitting , primarily because the discrepancy between the gravoko and rbc flux scales is not only frequency but also flux density dependent and there is no complete revision scale available . for a discussion see rbc .",

    "the effect of this turn over is marginal above 30 , but would require significantly increased complexity in the model .",
    "consequently these data have been excluded from the fit .",
    "we have presented parameterized broadband spectral models for six bright radio sources selected from the 3c survey between 30 - 300mhz , spread in right ascension from @xmath0hours . for each source ,",

    "we have shown that two of these sources lead to unacceptably high flux scale uncertainty at frequencies below 70mhz ( 3c147 & 3c295 ) , and we also note that 3c380 may be unsuitable for precision calibration at higher frequencies where its angular extent becomes an issue .",
