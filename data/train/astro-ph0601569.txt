    "our understanding of the origin and the acceleration mechanism of cosmic - ray particles has been a great challenge in astrophysics since the last century .",
    "x - ray observations have revealed that acceleration is taking place in supernova remnant shells by detecting featureless power - law type spectra ( koyama et al .",
    "1995 ; koyama et al .",
    "1997 ; slane et al .",
    "these spectra are interpreted as synchrotron radiation from accelerated electrons .",
    "the detections of tev photons in rx  j1713.7@xmath33946 ( muraishi et al . 2000 ; aharonian et al . 2004 ) and rx j0852.0@xmath34622 ( aharonian et al . 2005 ) have assured the presence of high - energy ( @xmath4tev ) particles , either leptons or hadrons , in these snr shells .    the radio source of g330.2 + 1.0 is characterized by a clumpy distorted shell of diameter ( caswell et al .",
    "1983 ; whiteoak , green 1996 ) .",
    "caswell et al .",
    "( 1983 ) attributed its morphology as being due to the interaction of a shock wave with a dense medium , particularly toward the lower galactic latitude ( southeast ) .",
    "a clumpiness in the radio map led whiteoak and green ( 1996 ) to classify g330.2 + 1.0 as a possible composite type . as we show in the following sections , there is no signature of a crab - like , compact x - ray source at the position of the clumpy radio shell .",
    "we therefore classify g330.2 + 1.0 as a shell type .",
    "the h absorption spectrum to the snr gives a minimum kinematic distance of @xmath5 kpc , while the greater distance for velocities interior to the solar circle , 9.9  kpc , can not be excluded ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2001 ; figure 4 and table 2 )",
    ". a possible association of the snr with the surrounding h shell ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2001 ; subsection 5.3.2 and figure 14 ) favors that the snr is close to the absorbing h clouds at @xmath6  kpc ( or at @xmath7  kpc ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the line of sight of @xmath8 intersects the norma arm at distances of @xmath9  kpc and @xmath10  kpc ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2001 ; figure 14 ) .",
    "therefore , a reasonable distance upper limit to the snr may be @xmath11  kpc . hereafter , we denote the snr distance as @xmath12 normalized to 4.9  kpc .",
    "for this distance and the radio shell s radius , the sedov solution s age  radius relation gives a minimum age of @xmath13 yr , with an explosion energy normalized to @xmath14erg and the interstellar medium density normalized to 1 @xmath15 .",
    "observations of snr g330.2 + 1.0 were performed with the asca ( tanaka et al .",
    "1994 ) on 1999 september 1112 .",
    "asca had four x - ray telescopes that were equipped with two ccd cameras ( sis  0 and sis  1 ) and two imaging gas - scintillation proportional counters ( gis  2 and gis  3 ) ( ohashi et al . 1996 ; makishima et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the sis was operated in the 1 ccd mode and its field of view ( @xmath16 ) did not cover the full spatial extent of the snr shell .",
    "we therefore concentrated on the gis data , which has a larger field of view ( diameter ) and a higher detection efficiency for hard x - ray sources .",
    "the effective exposure time for each gis was 19.6  ks .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows an x - ray image of g330.2 + 1.0 obtained with the gis .",
    "an extended shell is clearly detected as well as a compact source in the south .",
    "the position of the compact source , as determined from the gis image , is ( 16:00:51.0 , @xmath351:42:33)(j2000 ) ( hereafter ax  j1601@xmath35143 ) with a possible error of a few arcminutes .",
    "the radial profile of the compact source is found to be consistent with a point source . excluding background , the gis count rate for ax  j1601@xmath35143 was 0.094 cps and 0.074 cps for gis  2 and gis  3 , respectively .",
    "the lightcurve of ax  j1601@xmath35143 does not show any significant flux variability from timescales of minutes to hours .",
    "we did not detect any coherent pulsations either up to the nyquist frequency of 128  hz .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the gis image overlaid on the radio map .",
    "the radio emission is brightest at the eastern shell ( toward the lower galactic latitude ) , while the x - ray emission is brighter in the western part .",
    "the surface brightness of the shell is clearly anti - correlated between the radio and x - ray bands .",
    "figures  [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b show the gis spectra for the snr shell and the compact source , respectively , fitted with a power - law function modified by the interstellar absorption . as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , circular regions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 radii , centered at ( 16:00:50.9 , @xmath351:33:27)(j2000 ) and ( 16:00:50.9 , @xmath351:42:47)(j2000 ) , were used to extract spectra for the snr and the compact source , respectively .",
    "background spectra were extracted from a circular region of radius centered at ( 15:59:33.7 , @xmath351:25:35)(j2000 ) .",
    "spectral fits to a non - thermal ( power - law ) model and thermal ( mekal ) model by using xspec ( arnaud , 1996 ) are summarized in table [ tab : spectral_parameter ] .",
    "we further tried to investigate the spatial variation of the x - ray spectra across the snr shell , but limited statistics did not allow us to find any significant variation .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure1.eps    ( 70mm,70mm)figure2a.eps ( 70mm,70mm)figure2b.eps    .spectral parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath19 unabsorbed @xmath20  kev flux in @xmath21 .",
    "since the absorption columns to g330.2 + 1.0 and ax  j1601@xmath35143 ( table [ tab : spectral_parameter ] ) do not exclude a possibility that they are at a similar distance , we explore if the two objects are physically associated or not .",
    "ax  j1601@xmath35143 is probably the same object as 1rxs  j160045.0@xmath3514307 in the rosat all - sky survey faint source catalog ( voges et al .",
    "the cataloged position is @xmath22 from the gis position .",
    "the pspc countrate , @xmath23  cps , is as expected from the gis spectral parameters with either the mekal model or the power - law model , taking into account the statistical uncertainties of the pspc and gis data .",
    "if the power - law model is appropriate , ax  j1601@xmath35143 could be a crab - like object or a background active galactic nucleus .",
    "the absence of any significant long - term flux variability favors the former interpretation , but the required transverse velocity , @xmath24/3100)^{-1}\\,d_{4.9}\\ , { \\rm km\\ , s^{-1}}$ ] , for the projected angular distance from the shell center , @xmath25 or 13 @xmath12  pc , is unreasonably large . also , the observed photon index , 2.63 , is steeper than any object powered by an energetic pulsar ( e.g. , gotthelf 2003 ) .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that ax  j1601@xmath35143 is a crab - like pulsar / nebula .",
    "if the thermal interpretation is correct , ax  j1601@xmath35143 could be a nearby ( @xmath26  kpc ) white dwarf binary with @xmath27 .",
    "we have not found any clear evidence of line emissions in the gis spectra , and derive an equivalent width upper limit of @xmath28  ev for a narrow line at 6.7  kev from helium - like iron . this equivalent width and the elemental abundance ( table 1 )",
    "are not inconsistent with the characteristics found in white - dwarf binaries ( e.g. , ezuka , ishida 1999 ) .",
    "the remnant is in the crowded galactic plane , and it is not surprising that a point - like source has been found within the same field of view . we therefore conclude that g330.2 + 1.0 and ax  j1601@xmath35143 are not physically associated , and that g330.2 + 1.0 is a shell - type snr without an energetic pulsar .    from a statistical point of view alone , we can not distinguish the better spectral model for the snr shell ( table [ tab : spectral_parameter ] ) .",
    "if the thermal model is appropriate , the relatively high temperature ( @xmath29  kev ) suggests that the snr is young and emission lines from metal - rich ejecta should be expected .",
    "the absence of significant mg , si , s , and fe k shell lines is incompatible with our knowledge for young , high - temperature snrs , such as cas - a , tycho s , or kepler s ( e.g. , tsunemi et al .",
    "1986 ; kinugasa et al .",
    "the suppression of emission lines could occur if the interstellar medium density is very low , resulting in the low ionization state .",
    "this is unlikely , since the clumpy radio morphology suggests shock interaction with the dense medium .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to explain the spectrum in the thermal model .",
    "we thus conclude that the most reasonable interpretation for the featureless spectrum in g330.2 + 1.0 is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated in the snr shell .",
    "to evaluate multi - wavelength emission , we fit the snr spectrum with the srcut model , which describes synchrotron radiation from a power - law distribution of electrons with an exponential cut - off ( reynolds , keohane 1999 ) .",
    "for a fixed radio spectral index ( @xmath30 ) and flux density ( 5 jy at 1 ghz ) ( green 2004 ) , the fit is significantly worse ( @xmath31 ) than that of the simple power - law model .",
    "this means that the radio and x - ray emission can not have originated from a simple , single population of electrons in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the best - fit parameters are the break frequency of @xmath32  hz and the absorption column of @xmath33 .",
    "if the radio flux density is considered as a free parameter , the fit becomes better ( @xmath34 ) with @xmath35  hz , a flux density of @xmath36  jy , and @xmath37 .",
    "the break frequency corresponds to an electron energy of @xmath38  tev . here ,",
    "@xmath39 , is the magnetic field of the emitting region normalized to 5 @xmath40 .",
    "the small best - fit flux density ( @xmath41  jy at 1 ghz ) compared to that observed ( 5 jy ) suggests that there are at least two populations of particles , and only a tiny fraction of the radio - emitting particles has an extended tail toward the tev region .    as can be seen in figure [ fig1 ] ,",
    "the surface brightness of the x - ray emission is anti - correlated with the radio emission .",
    "the x - ray emission is strongest at the western shell , where the lower radio intensity toward the higher galactic latitude suggests a lower ism density .",
    "it is likely that moderately accelerated ( gev ) electrons are efficiently decelerated in the eastern shell interacting with the dense ism .",
    "in contrast , the lower ism density in the western shell results in efficient acceleration to the tev range .",
    "the co - existence of two distinct ( radio bright / x - ray faint and radio faint / x - ray bright ) shells in a single supernova remnant gives us an interesting opportunity to study the acceleration mechanisms in different ism environments .",
    "interestingly , the x - ray luminosity of the shell , @xmath42 ( 0.710  kev ) is comparable to that for rx  j1713.7@xmath33946 ( @xmath43 ) , sn  1006 ( @xmath44 ) , rx  j0852.0@xmath34622 ( @xmath45 ) ( slane et al .",
    "1999 ; slane et al . 2001 ) , within a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "there may be common physics at work for tuning the acceleration efficiency in these snrs .    in summary , we reported on the discovery of a featureless x - ray spectrum in the snr g330.2 + 1.0 .",
    "we interpret this emission as coming from synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated at the snr shock as seen in sn  1006 and rx  j1713.7@xmath33946 .",
    "our preliminary analysis of the archived xmm - newton data with short exposure ( @xmath47  ks ) qualitatively confirmed our findings presented herein .",
    "further analysis of the xmm - newton data with an emphasis on the nature of ax  j1601@xmath35143 will be presented elsewhere .",
    "since the surface brightness of the shell is low , x - ray observations with suzaku , which has a large effective area and low background , will be useful for an accurate determination of the snr spectrum . although neither g330.2 + 1.0 nor the compact source was detected in the recent h.e.s.s .",
    "survey ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) , additional deep searches for tev emission may be useful . for constraining different radiation mechanisms ( inverse compton effect , pion decay , non - thermal bremsstrahlung ) in the tev region , radio observations of the environmental molecular gas ( e.g. , fukui et al .",
    "2001 ) will be of great help .",
