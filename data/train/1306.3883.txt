    "the infrared triplet ( cat ) lines at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662  , easily differentiated even in low- and medium - resolution spectra ( r@xmath42000 - 10000 ) , are the main features of the near infrared spectra of late - type giant stars . since their strengths change as a function of the metal content , they have been widely used as metallicity indicators in a variety of systems like open ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and globular ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) clusters , dwarf spheroidal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and irregular ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) galaxies , and even in a more complex system like the large magellanic cloud ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "initially , the cat lines were employed to determine metallicities in relatively metal - poor and old systems such as the galactic globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these works utilized the classical approach of determining the equivalent widths of the cat lines by fitting their profiles with gaussian functions .",
    "the direct integration is hampered by the contamination of the wings with weak neutral metal lines and molecular bands .",
    "there were some attempts of extending this calibration to more metal - rich and younger regimes .",
    "all of them were hindered by the non - gaussian shape of damping wings in strong lines of stars with [ fe / h]@xmath5 - 1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to address this issue",
    ", @xcite proposed to fit the line profile with a sum of a gaussian and a lorentzian functions . for weak lines",
    "the lorentzian component is equal to zero and the line profile is reproduced by a single gaussian . in the case of strong lines , the gaussian reproduces the line core but the lorentzian component is necessary to properly sample the wings . using this procedure ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) extended the empirical calibration of the strength of the cat lines as metallicity indicator for 13@xmath6age(gyr)@xmath60.25 and -2.2@xmath6[fe / h]@xmath6 + 0.47 .",
    "they also demonstrated that the age influence is negligible .",
    "curiously , none of the studies performed until that moment , and in particular those devoted to the metal - poor dwarf spheroidal galaxies , had detected stars more metal - poor than [ fe / h]@xmath6 - 3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the halo of the milky way contains a significant number of these objects which might reveal valuable information about the chemical evolution history of a galaxy , as they represent the most pristine ( and probably thus the oldest ) stars in the system . by comparison with metallicities derived from high - resolution spectroscopy analysis",
    ", @xcite found that cat calibrations saturate for [ fe / h]@xmath6 - 2.5 , and therefore , they are not able to detect stars more metal - poor than this value .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     references : az88 : @xcite ; ad91 : @xcite ; smt+93 : @xcite ; rhs97 : @xcite ; ccg+01 : @xcite ; bit+08 : @xcite ; sht+10 : @xcite .",
    "several comparisons among the different cat indices can be found in the literature using stars in common among different studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "however , to our knowledge , only @xcite compared the final metallicities derived from their cat calibration with reference values derived independently from high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "it would be very useful to compare the metallicities derived from the different cat calibrations available in the literature with the reference values obtained from the analysis of both and spectral lines in high - resolution spectra .",
    "the cat calibrations are based on four ingredients : the bandpasses used to determine the continuum and spectral features ; the way in which the line profile is fit ; the reference metallicities used ; and the form of the relationship among the cat index , the luminosity indicator and the reference metallicities . in section  [ sec1 ] , it has been explained in detail how different assumptions on some of these points affect the final cat calibration .",
    "we have selected eight reference works which are listed in table  [ table_comparison ] , together with the different approach used by each of them .",
    "they have been selected in order to include the most used bandpasses , line profile functions and relationships among cat index , luminosity indicator and metallicity .    to perform this comparison",
    "we have determined the equivalent width of each cat line in the same clusters and metal - poor stars used in this paper .",
    "we have followed the procedure that define each calibration , i.e. used the same bandpasses , line profile functions , index definitions , luminosity indicators and relationships among cat index , luminosity indicator and reference metallicities .",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers for a detailed description of each procedure .    0.2 dex.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_comparacion ] we have plotted the high - resolution reference metallicities ( x - axis ) described in section  [ sec4 ] versus the metallicity values obtained with each calibration ( y - axis ) .",
    "the @xcite calibration has the largest scatter , particularly at the metal - poor regime .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that it is the only one in which a quadratic relationship has been assumed between the reduced equivalent widths and metallicities .",
    "however , it behaves well in the metallicity range in which it was defined ( -2@xmath6[fe / h]@xmath6 - 0.7 ) .",
    "all the calibrations before @xcite , including that obtained in paper i , saturate at extremely metal - poor regimes ( [ fe / h]@xmath6 - 2.5 ) as was noted by @xcite .",
    "a large scatter is observed at metal - rich regimes ( [ fe / h]@xmath7 - 0.25 ) with the exception of the one obtained in paper i. these is observed even in the case of the one derived by @xcite which used metal - rich open clusters as calibrators , together with metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "this denotes that together with the inclusion of the lorentzian profile to sample the strong wings in metal - rich stars as was proposed by @xcite , it is key to use bandpasses large enough to sample completely the wings of strong lines .",
    "the addition of two new terms in the relationship among the cat index , luminosity indicator and metallicity proposed by @xcite solved the saturation problem at metal - poor metallicities .",
    "although they adopted a correction procedure to account for the contribution of the damping wings of strong metal - rich to their single gaussian fit , their calibration fails at metal - rich regimes .",
    "the calibration obtained in this paper seems to behave well in the whole range of metallicities covered .    in the left panel figure  [ fig_comparison2 ]",
    "we have directly compared the metallicities calculated with the calibrations obtained in paper i and in this paper . in general both calibrations produce similar metallicities within the uncertainties for -2@xmath6[fe / h]@xmath60 . as expected",
    ", the calibration derived in paper i produces more metal - rich values for [ fe / h]@xmath8 - 2 .",
    "this difference can be as large as 1 dex for [ fe / h]@xmath8 - 2.5 .",
    "we perform the same comparison in right panel of figure  [ fig_comparison2 ] with the metallicities computed from the calibration obtained by @xcite from synthetic spectra . in general",
    ", there is a good agreement within the uncertainties between both calibrations for -3@xmath6[fe / h]@xmath6 - 0.5 .",
    "there are differences larger than 0.5 between the values obtained from both calibrations for metallicities more metal - rich than [ fe / h]@xmath40 .",
    "again this is explained because their method do not sample properly the large wings of strong metal - rich lines .",
    "there are also large differences in the most metal - poor metallicities which may be explained by the difficulty of properly modelled the cat lines at these extremely metal - poor metallicities .",
    "but the colors are defined as a function of [ ca / h ] abundances .",
    ", width=321 ]      in spite that the strength of the cat lines is expected to depend mainly on the ca abundances rather than on the iron ones this is not the case , as it has been pointed by several investigations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , by comparing the ca and fe abundances determined from high - resolution spectroscopy and the cat strength in medium - resolution spectra , @xcite found that the cat lines are a more robust estimator of [ fe / h ] than of [ ca / h ] .",
    "@xcite found that part of this discrepancy can be reduced if non - local thermodynamic equilibrium is taken into account to derive the calcium abundances from lines .",
    "they suggest that the remaining discrepancy may relate to the outer atmospheric layers that are not very well modelled  even in non - local thermodynamic equilibrium . in this section",
    "we investigate whether the same behavior holds at the very low metallicity interval .    as in fig .",
    "[ fig_luminosity ] , in fig .",
    "[ fig_luminosity_cah ] we have plotted the run of @xmath9 as a function of the different luminosity indicators used . in this case , the different colors denote different [ ca / h ] ratios . as in the case of fe",
    ", there is a clear trend with ca abundances , as expected , since [ fe / h ] is correlated with [ ca / h ] , down to very low metallicities , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cah ] . however , comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig_luminosity ]  and  [ fig_luminosity_cah ] , reveals that @xmath10 ca reflects more cleanly the fe abundances than the ca ones . as in paper",
    "i , we conclude that to properly investigate the relation of the cat equivalent widths with the ca and fe abundances , it may be necessary to sample objects with very different [ ca / h ] ratios at a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "versus [ fe / h ] for the stars in our sample , down to the very low metallicities studied in this paper.,width=317 ]",
    "the cluster sample used in paper i has been complemented with observations of extremely metal - poor field stars in order to obtain a new calibration of the strength of the infrared cat lines as metallicity indicator .",
    "the obtained calibration is of very general use and applicability since : i ) it is valid in the range -4@xmath6[fe / h]@xmath6 + 0.5 , which is the widest metallicity range in which the behavior of the cat lines has been homogeneously investigated .",
    "ii ) it has been obtained on the basis of the traditional luminosity indicators v - v@xmath0 , m@xmath1 , m@xmath2 , but also as a function of m@xmath3 .",
    "this will allow to use also the magnitudes derived by 2mass , which covers almost the whole celestial sphere .",
    "iii ) it is valid for at least five magnitudes below the tip of the rgb .",
    "iv ) the contribution of each line to the global cat index , obtained as @xmath11 has been determined .",
    "the strength of each line at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662    contribute with the 19% , 47% , and 34% to @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the calibration obtained in this paper results in a tight correlation between [ fe / h ] abundances measured from high resolution spectra and [ fe / h ] values derived from the cat , over the whole metallicity range covered .",
    "former saturations of the index , at low and high metallicities , which hampered the use of the cat in these metallicity regimes , are no longer observed .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the cat remains a powerful metallicity indicator , applicable to nearby extragalactic star clusters and galaxies where high resolution metallicity measurements are not possible due to the faintness of the targets .",
