    "the burgers equation is one of the basic nonlinear evolution equations . @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the time variable , and @xmath2 is the space variable .",
    "the equation describes the evolution of velocity vector field @xmath3 of sticky dust particles in the presence of external potential forcing @xmath4 .    burgers introduced this equation as a turbulence model .",
    "although it was soon discovered that the dynamics governed by  ( [ eqburgers ] ) does not describe turbulence adequately , the equation has naturally appeared in various other contexts , from cosmology to traffic modeling .",
    "an informative recent survey on burgers turbulence is  @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable properties of the burgers equation is that even if the initial data at time  @xmath5 and the forcing are smooth , the solution of the cauchy problem typically develops discontinuities or shocks , and if one wants to extend the solution beyond the formation of shock waves , one has to work with generalized solutions . under mild assumptions on the initial data and forcing ,",
    "only one of the generalized solutions is physical .",
    "this solution is called the entropy or viscosity solution , and it can be found using a characterization that is often called the lax  oleinik variational principle ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "namely , the solution potential [ a function @xmath6 such that @xmath7 for a.e .",
    "@xmath2 ] satisfies @xmath9 the expression in the curly brackets is called action , and the the infimum of action is taken over all absolutely continuous trajectories @xmath10 defined on @xmath11 $ ] and terminating at @xmath12 at time @xmath13 .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15    following the hydrodynamic interpretation of the burgers equation , one can identify the action minimizers in  ( [ eqvariationalprinciple ] ) as the particle trajectories .",
    "this kind of representation holds true for a more general equation of hamilton  jacobi type .",
    "the specifics of the burgers equation is that if @xmath16 is a unique minimizer in ( [ eqvariationalprinciple ] ) , then @xmath17 .",
    "when the forcing is a random field , one has to work with optimization problems for paths accumulating action from a random lagrangian landscape , so questions about burgers equations with randomness become random media questions .",
    "the ergodic theory of the burgers equation with random forcing begins with  @xcite .",
    "the forcing in  @xcite is assumed to be white noise type in time and smooth and periodic in space .",
    "due to the periodicity assumption , the evolution effectively takes place on a circle .",
    "the compactness of the circle allows for efficient control of the long time behavior of action minimizers , which leads to constructing attracting global solutions and thus to a complete description of the ergodic components for the dynamics , each one consisting of all velocity profiles with given mean velocity .",
    "this work was extended and streamlined in  @xcite and @xcite , where the multidimensional version of the burgers equation with positive or zero viscosity on a torus was considered . in",
    "@xcite the ergodic theory for the burgers equation on a segment with random boundary conditions was developed .    in all of these papers",
    "the compactness of the domain played an important role .",
    "in fact , in the case of unbounded domain with no periodicity assumption , currently there is no complete understanding of the ergodic properties of the burgers equation .",
    "let us summarize what is known .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the burgers equation in @xmath18 with aperiodic white - noise forcing with certain localization properties was considered . a global solution constructed in the paper",
    "was shown to have a basin of attraction containing the zero velocity profile , but no interesting properties of the global solution were established , and the description of the domain of attraction of the global solution was incomplete .    in  @xcite , it was noted that in the absence of periodicity assumptions , the long time behavior of solutions can depend on the behavior of the initial condition at infinity in an essential way . in particular , it was shown that outside the main ergodic component ( containing the zero velocity profile ) , there are solutions with significantly different behavior .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new kind of random forcing for the burgers equation on the real line with no periodicity assumption .",
    "the forcing potential we suggest is given by a poisson point field .",
    "in this model , paths accumulate their action traveling through a cloud of random poissonian points .",
    "although this model preserves many features of the white noise model , it is easier to analyze and visualize .",
    "it also has much in common with the well - known hammersley process ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) which has been explicitly used for the analysis of hydrodynamic limit resulting in the burgers equation in  @xcite.=1    for the new model , we are able to construct a global solution via a limiting procedure seeded at zero initial condition , prove a so called one force ",
    "one solution principle ( 1f1s ) , and describe the main ergodic component of the system , that is , the basin of attraction of the global solution .",
    "1f1s for the burgers equation on the circle is tightly connected to the hyperbolicity of the global action minimizer . in particular , for any two burgers particles",
    ", the distance between their backward trajectories ( given by the corresponding one - sided action minimizers ) converges to zero .",
    "a stronger phenomenon occurs in the case of poissonian forcing : for any two particles , their backward trajectories will meet at one of the poissonian points in finite time and coincide from that point on in the reverse time .",
    "this stronger form of hyperbolicity may naturally be called hyperhyperbolicity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ secpoissonianmodel ] we introduce the new forcing model based on poissonian points . in section",
    "[ secgeometry - of - solutions ] we discuss the geometry of foliation of the space ",
    "time into particle trajectories under point forcing . in section  [ secmainres ]",
    "we formulate our main results . in section  [ secconstructing ]",
    "we construct the global solution . in section  [ secatinfty ]",
    "we describe its behavior at infinity . in section  [ secattractor ] , we show that this solution is an attractor and describe its basin of attraction . in section  [ secglobalmin ]",
    "we study global minimizers .",
    "an important part of that section is a central limit theorem discribing the diffusive behavior of global minimizers for periodic poissonian forcing .",
    "the goal of this section is to describe the model rigorously , so let us now be more precise .",
    "the model is based on a poisson point field , and we refer to  @xcite for an introduction to point processes as random integer - valued measures .",
    "we are working on a complete probability space @xmath19 .",
    "it is convenient to identify @xmath20 with the space of locally finite point configurations @xmath21 in space ",
    "time @xmath22 .",
    "the sigma - algebra @xmath23 is generated by maps @xmath24 assigning to each @xmath25 the number of points of @xmath25 in a bounded borel set @xmath26 .",
    "the measure  @xmath27 is the distribution of a poisson point field with intensity measure @xmath28 .",
    "since we want the forcing to be stationary in time , we shall always assume that the intensity is a product measure @xmath29 then for disjoint sets @xmath30 , the random variables @xmath31 are independent and poissonian with parameters @xmath32 .",
    "we will denote the integral term in  ( [ eqvariationalprinciple ] ) as @xmath33 and redefine the contribution from the potential by @xmath34 where for a path @xmath10 and times @xmath5 and @xmath13 satisfying @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the number of poissonian points that @xmath10 passes through between @xmath5 and @xmath13 . in other words ,",
    "each poissonian point visited by the path contributes @xmath37 to the action .",
    "an immediate generalization of our model is a compound poisson point field where each point comes with a random weight which results in random contributions to the action .",
    "in fact , all our results can be extended to that case under reasonable assumptions on the random weights .",
    "however , for simplicity we concentrate here on the simple poisson process .    definition  ( [ eqpoisson - forcing ] ) results in the following expression for action accumulated by a path @xmath10 between times @xmath5 and @xmath38 : @xmath39    it is well known ( or can be easily derived from the euler ",
    "lagrange equations ) that in the zero forcing field , the minimizers ( or particle trajectories ) are straight lines .",
    "we conclude that between visits to poissonian points , action - minimizing paths are straight lines .",
    "let us introduce more notation .",
    "for two times @xmath5 and @xmath40 , and two sets @xmath41 , we denote by @xmath42 the set of all piecewise linear paths defined between @xmath5 and @xmath40 such that switchings from one linear regime to another happen only at poissonian points .",

    "first we recall that the natural space of solutions for the burgers equation consists of piecewise continuous functions @xmath47 defined on @xmath48 , with right and left limits at every point , with at most countably many discontinuities , each discontinuity being a downward jump or shock @xmath49 .",
    "( the shock absorbs incoming particles on both sides . )",
    "we shall impose an additional restriction on these functions to be bounded and will not distinguish between two functions that coincide at all their continuity points .",
    "we will denote the resulting factor space by  @xmath50 , and often we will abuse the notation writing @xmath51 when @xmath47 is a representative of an element of @xmath50 .",

    "throughout this paper , we consider the external forcing that is concentrated on a discrete set of poissonian points ( we will often call them _ forcing points _ ) .",
    "this is different from traditionally considered smooth forcing fields , so let us understand the effect of this kind of forcing on the solution .",
    "let us consider a model situation where a smooth beam of burgers particles encounters a forcing point at the origin at time @xmath91 .",
    "let us assume that at time  @xmath91 , the velocity vector field near @xmath91 is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "it is clear that for every @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath12 close to the origin , there are two minimizer candidates .",
    "the minimizer either passes through the origin , or it does not . if it does , then ( assuming there are no other point sources of forcing ) it has to be a straight line connecting the origin to @xmath94 , and the accumulated action is @xmath96 , where @xmath37 is the contribution of the forcing point at the origin , and @xmath97 is the action accumulated while moving with constant velocity @xmath98 between @xmath91 and @xmath13 .",
    "if the minimizer does not pass through the origin , then it is a straight line connecting some point @xmath99 to @xmath94 . on the one hand ,",
    "the velocity of the particle associated with the minimizer is @xmath100 . on the other hand",
    ", it has to coincide with @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we can find @xmath102 . taking into account",
    "that @xmath103 , we can compute that the total action of that path is @xmath104 .    to see which of the two cases is realized for @xmath94 we must compare @xmath105 and @xmath106 . if @xmath107 , then the particle arriving to @xmath12 at time @xmath13 is at the origin at time @xmath91 . if @xmath108 , then the particle arriving to @xmath12 at time",
    "@xmath13 is one of the particles that moved with constant velocity and was a part of the incoming beam . if @xmath109 , then both of these paths are minimizers , and at time @xmath13 there is a shock at point @xmath12 .",
    "the relation @xmath109 can be rewritten as @xmath110 for small values of @xmath13 , the set of points satisfying this relation looks like a parabola @xmath111 ; see figure  [ fig1pt ] where an example with @xmath112 and @xmath113 is shown .",
    "we see that when a poissonian point appears , it emits a continuum of particles , each moving with constant velocity , creating two shock fronts moving ( at least for a short time ) to the left and right .",
    "it is important to notice that in our model case with a forcing point at the origin , @xmath114 for all points connected to the origin by a minimizing segment .",
    "it means that for each time @xmath13 , the velocity is linear in the domain of influence of the forcing point , and the velocity gradient decays with time as @xmath115 .",
    "in general , the behavior of this kind occurs near each forcing point , and in the long run more and more points of the space ",
    "time plane get assigned to forcing points .",
    "grouping together points assigned to the same forcing point , we obtain a tesselation of space ",
    "time into domains of influence of forcing points .",
    "inside each domain or cell , the velocity field is linear in @xmath12 if the time  @xmath13 is fixed .",
    "it is well known that in the burgers equation the energy is dissipated at the shocks ; see , e.g. , @xcite . by seeding new particles at each poissonian point , the forcing pumps energy into the system , and",
    ", therefore , we can hope that there is a dynamical or statistical energy balance in the system .",
    "we will actually see that this dissipation results in asymptotic alignment of the velocities of particles that keep moving away from the origin without being absorbed into shocks .",
    "another point of view at the stationarity and ergodicity issues for this system is related to the stabilization of the tesselation of space ",

    "sketch of proof we can use lemma  [ lmcollapse - with - positive - prob ] to derive sequentially that ( i ) for any @xmath661 and for sufficiently large values @xmath662 the restrictions onto @xmath663 $ ] of minimizers in @xmath664 can be bounded by the process of localization radii @xmath665 , @xmath666 $ ] ; ( ii ) for any @xmath661 , and for sufficiently large values @xmath662 , these minimizers pass through common points before @xmath667 and after @xmath668 , and , therefore , coincide between these points . we conclude that as @xmath669 the minimizers stabilize on any finite interval , and the restriction of the resulting limiting trajectory @xmath670 on any finite time interval is a minimizer .",
    "moreover , @xmath671 and the recurrence property of @xmath672 follows .",

    "therefore , @xmath520 has to coincide with @xmath672 .",
    "the following statement can be proven in a similar way :    [ thhyperhyperbolicity ] if @xmath520 is one of the one - sided infinite minimizers constructed in remark  [ remone - sidedminimizers ] , then there is @xmath213 such that restrictions of @xmath10 and @xmath520 on @xmath676 $ ] coincide .",
    "this property shows that the global minimizer has superstrong attraction property in the reverse time . in previously considered situations",
    "the exponential convergence of one - sided minimizers in the reverse time was a manifestation of hyperbolicity of the global minimizer .",
    "in analogy with that case , it is natural to refer to the property of finite - time supercontraction described in theorem  [ thhyperhyperbolicity ] as `` hyperhyperbolicity . ''    _ global minimizers for the burgers equation with spatially periodic forcing_. let us now change the framework and switch to the burgers equation with spatially periodic random forcing .",
    "one of the questions that has not been answered for the periodic burgers equation is the fluctuations of the global minimizer .",
    "this question was posed to the author by yakov sinai .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove that for the poissonian forcing on the circle @xmath677 , the unique global minimizer has diffusive behavior .",
    "let us consider the burgers dynamics on @xmath678 under poissonian forcing with intensity measure given by @xmath679 on the cylinder @xmath680 for some borel measure @xmath143 on @xmath677 . if we restrict ourselves to the set @xmath681 , then the potential @xmath65 of any @xmath682 is well - defined , and we can define the dynamics via  ( [ eqdefofcocycle ] ) , ( [ eqminimizationproblem ] ) with the only correction that paths are in @xmath677 .    the set @xmath683 is invariant under this dynamics .",
    "in fact , between occurences of poissonian points , we are solving the usual unforced burgers equation and the mean velocity stays constant . on the other hand",
    "it is easy to see that the mean velocity is continuous in time even at the time corresponding to the occurence of a forcing point .",
    "a continuous piecewise constant function is constant , and our invariance claim follows .",
    "the theory that was developed above for the poisson forcing on the line , applies to this case as well , so one has a unique global attracting soliution .",
    "one also has a unique global minimizer @xmath672 with asymptotic slope 0 corresponding to the mean velocity 0 . to formulate the main theorem we must unfold @xmath677 onto its universal cover @xmath48 and treat @xmath672 as a continuous path on  @xmath48 .",
    "there is a nonrandom number @xmath684 such that @xmath685 converges in distribution to the standard gaussian random variable as @xmath428 .",
    "the times between occurrences of poisson points are exponentially distributed .",
    "therefore , the set of all poisson points @xmath686 such that there are no other poisson points in @xmath687\\times{\\mathbb{s}}^1 $ ] is unbounded in both directions .",
    "we agree that @xmath688 .",
    "it is easy to check that the global minimizer @xmath10 passes through all these points on the cylinder ( or their lifts on the universal cover ) .",
    "let us denote @xmath689 , @xmath690 and @xmath691 .",
    "notice that all random variables from sequences @xmath692 , @xmath693 , and realizations of poissonian point field between @xmath694 and @xmath695 are jointly independent .",
    "they are also identically distributed within each sequence , the tails of @xmath696 are exponential and the distribution of @xmath697 is @xmath698 .",
    "since @xmath699 is a functional of @xmath696 , @xmath700 , and the realization of the poissonian field between @xmath694 and @xmath695 , the sequence @xmath701 of identically distributed random variables is 1-dependent ( the dependence comes only through @xmath697 occuring in both @xmath700 and @xmath702 ) .    we know that there is no systematic drift , that is , @xmath703 as @xmath704 . by the law of large numbers , @xmath705 , so @xmath706 , and @xmath707 .",
    "therefore , by bernstein s clt for @xmath143-dependent random variables , we conclude that the distribution of @xmath708 converges weakly to the standard gaussian one , where @xmath709 .",
    "applying the law of large numbers once again , we conclude that @xmath710 as @xmath428 along the sequence @xmath711 .",
    "to finish the proof , one has to extend this convergence to all intermediate values of @xmath13 , but this is not hard since the tails of @xmath696 are exponential .",
    "this completes the proof with @xmath712 .",
    "it is also possible to prove a functional version of the above clt with two - sided wiener measure in the role of the limiting distribution for appropriately normalized global minimizer .",
