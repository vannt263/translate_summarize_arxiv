    "in this talk i want to discuss some results related to saturation and multiple collisions obtained in collaboration with emil avsar , christoffer flensburg , and leif lnnblad @xcite . in high energy @xmath0 collisions",
    "the minijet cross section is much larger than the total cross section .",
    "this implies that each event contains on average more than one minijet pair , and multiple subcollisions are an essential feature of high energy hadronic reactions . a formulation in transverse coordinate space and the eikonal approximation are particularly suited for a treatment of these features , and has been successfully applied to @xmath1 collisions , both for total and diffractive scattering cross sections @xcite .",
    "the application of the eikonal formalism is , however , mainly applicable for inclusive observables , and a description of exclusive final states is more easy in momentum space . at present the most successful model for high energy @xmath0 collisions",
    "is the pythia model by sjstrand and coworkers @xcite , which has been extensively tuned to tevatron data by r. field @xcite .",
    "there are , however , a set of problems connected to these tunes .",
    "how does the partonic final state hadronize ?",
    "a fit to data needs strong colour reconnections , for which we have a poor theoretical understanding .",
    "also it is difficult to properly include effects of correlations and fluctuations in momentum space cascades .    in this talk",
    "i want to discuss a new approach based on mueller s dipole cascade model , which is an attempt to combine the good features of formulations in transverse coordinate space and in momentum space .",
    "at 14 tev , from ref . @xcite . ]    in collinear factorization the inclusive parton scattering cross section diverges like @xmath2 for small @xmath3 .",
    "an estimate of the integrated jet cross section above a cut @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptint ] for @xmath0 scattering at 14 tev .",
    "we here see that for @xmath5 gev the integrated jet cross section exceeds the total cross section , which implies that an average collision must have several hard subcollisions .",
    "multiple collisions have also been directly observed in collider experiments .",
    "thus four - jet events with pairwise back - to - back jets have been seen by afs at the isr , by ua2 at the cern s@xmath6s collider , and by cdf at the tevatron . at the tevatron",
    "the most clear signal is observed in the analysis of 3 jets + a prompt photon @xcite .",
    "it was early suggested that the increase in the @xmath0 cross section is driven by minijet production , and that minimum bias events are dominated by ( semi)hard parton subcollisions @xcite .",
    "this is also an essential assumption in the pythia model .",
    "this model is also based on collinear factorization , which implies that a cutoff is needed for the singularity at small @xmath3 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that hadrons are colour neutral , and therefore the coulomb potential must be screened for large impact parameters or small @xmath3 .",
    "fits to collider data give a cutoff at around 2 gev , slowly increasing at higher energies .",
    "( a similar cutoff is also obtained naturally in the @xmath7-factorization formalism @xcite . in the dipole cascade model the transverse momentum @xmath7 of a colliding gluon is related to the dipole size in transverse coordinate space , and therefore also to the screening length . )    for the more recent version of pythia this cutoff gives typically 2 - 3 interactions per event at the tevatron , and 4 - 5 at the lhc .",
    "an important feature is also that the subcollisions are correlated .",
    "central collisions have many interactions , while peripheral collisions have few . in the experimental analyses",
    "this is described in terms of an effective cross section @xmath8 .",
    "the cross section @xmath9 for the simultaneous hard reactions @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) is written as @xmath13 .",
    "if the interactions @xmath10 and @xmath11 were uncorrelated we would have @xmath8 equal to the inelastic nondiffractive cross section ( @xmath14 50 mb at the tevatron ) .",
    "instead the experimental results give the much smaller result @xmath15 mb , which thus corresponds to a very strong enhancement .",
    "although the pythia model has been tuned to fit most of the cdf data on minimum bias and underlying events , there are a number of open questions :    - how does a many - parton system hadronize in an event with multiple hard subcollisions ?",
    "the result expected in the string hadronization model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : recoupl ] . in a hard gluon - gluon subcollision the outgoing gluons will be colour - connected to the projectile and target remnants , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : recoupl]a .",
    "initial state radiation may give extra gluon `` kinks '' , which are ordered in rapidity . a second hard scattering",
    "would naively be expected to give two new strings connected to the remnants as in fig .",
    "[ fig : recoupl]b . as a result",
    "this would give almost doubled multiplicity .",
    "this is not in agreement with data . in the successful fits @xcite it",
    "is instead assumed that the gluons are colour reconnected , so that the total string length becomes as short as possible , see fig .  [",
    "fig : recoupl]c .",
    "this colour reconnection implies that a minimum number of hadrons share the transverse momentum of the partons .    - in most analysis , including pythia , it is assumed that the impact parameter and momentum distributions of the interacting partons factorize . in a dipole cascade model",
    "strong non - factorizing correlations are expected between impact parameter , momentum , and multiplicity of the colliding partons in a proton .",
    "besides such correlations , also the expected large fluctuations in multiplicity and impact parameter distributions are more difficult to include in a momentum space formalism .",
    "a formalism in transverse coordinate space is very suitable for describing rescattering and multiple collisions . in a process where a particle undergoes successive interactions with transverse momenta @xmath16 , the resulting transverse momentum @xmath17",
    "is given by a convolution of the different interactions .",
    "as the fourier transform of a convolution is given by a simple product , we see that in impact parameter space the multiple interactions are described by a product of the @xmath18-matrix elements for the individual interactions : @xmath19 thus for @xmath20 we find @xmath21 .",
    "a coulomb field which is boosted is contracted to a flat pancake , with a dominantly transverse electric field @xmath22 and an orthogonal transverse magnetic field with the same magnitude . here",
    "@xmath23 is the ( two - dimensional ) distance between the position of the central charge and the point of observation ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ww ] ) . the pulse will be very short in time , and can be approximated by a @xmath24-function : @xmath25 the frequency distribution is given by the fourier transform of @xmath26 , which is a constant .",
    "thus the distribution of photons , or gluons , seen by an observer at point @xmath23 is given by @xmath27    inside a proton there is a very complicated colour field .",
    "we may however imagine that within some distance @xmath28 from a colour charge it is approximately a coulomb field , while for larger distances the charge is screened by other charges .",
    "if @xmath28 is around 0.1 fm this would give an effective cutoff for hard subcollisions with @xmath29 gev , as obtained in the fits to experimental data .    a bremsstrahlung gluon from this field",
    "will change the colour of the initial charge .",
    "if the initial charge is a red quark , it may emit a red - antiblue gluon and change its colour to blue .",
    "the result is that the initial red coulomb field now terminates at the gluon charge , and a blue - antiblue dipole field is formed between the quark and the gluon .",
    "the emission of softer gluons now get two separate contributions , one from the modified coulomb field and one from the new colour dipole between the quark and the gluon .",
    "the repeated emission of more gluons results in a cascade , as discussed in the next section .      a dipole cascade model in transverse coordinate space was developed by a. mueller in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "we study an initial colour neutral quark - antiquark system .",
    "the colour dipole field gets two contributions of the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efield ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipolesplit]a . adding these with opposite signs the resulting transverse colour - electric field @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the size of the parent dipole , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the distances from the point @xmath23 to the two charges ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dipolesplit]a ) . as discussed above this",
    "implies that the probability to emit a gluon in the point @xmath23 becomes @xmath35 if the initial charges were red and antired , the emitted gluon may be red - antiblue , changing the initially red charge to blue .",
    "therefore such an emission implies that the dipole is split in two connected dipoles , one blue - antiblue and one red - antired .",
    "these can then also split repeatedly in a dipole cascade , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipolesplit]b . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is demonstrated that this cascade reproduces the ll bfkl evolution .",
    "when two such cascades collide as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipcoll ] , two dipoles ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 with endpoints ( @xmath38 ) and ( @xmath39 ) respectively ) may interact via gluon exchange .",
    "adding coherently the exchange between charge or anticharge in both dipoles gives the interaction probability @xmath40 as the exchanged gluon carries colour , the dipole chains are reconnected , as also indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipcoll ] .",
    "the result is two dipole chains connecting the remnants of the projectile and the target systems , as also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : recoupl ] .",
    "it is also possible that several pairs ( @xmath41 ) interact . in the eikonal approximation the total , diffractive , and elastic cross sections",
    "are given by    @xmath42    we note that as the parentheses always are smaller than unity , unitarity is always satisfied .",
    "we also note that diffractive excitation , which is given by the difference between the second and third lines in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eikonalcrossections ] ) , is directly determined by the fluctuations in the cascade evolution .    a schematic picture of a collision between two evolved dipole cascades is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalstate ] . in this example",
    "there are in the cms ( indicated by a dashed line ) three separate subcollisions .",
    "these also correspond to the exchange of three pomerons .",
    "they result in two closed loops formed by chains of colour dipoles , in addition to the two dipole chains which connect the projectile and target remnants .",
    "[ fig : finalstate ] also contains a dipole loop ( denoted @xmath10 ) inside the evolution of the left system , before it collides .",
    "such loops are , however , not included in mueller s model , which only accounts for loops cut in the specific lorentz frame used for the calculation .",
    "this implies that this model is not lorentz frame independent .    ) within the left system , caused by a `` dipole swing '' .",
    "the parts of the evolutions marked @xmath11 and @xmath43 do not interact , and should be treated as virtual . ]",
    "although mueller s cascade model , and also the balitsky - kovchegov evolution equation , reproduce ll bfkl evolution and satisfies the unitarity constraints , they have a set of problems :    * ll bfkl is not good enough .",
    "nll corrections are very large . *",
    "non - linear effects in the evolution are not included .",
    "* massless gluon exchange implies a violation of froissart s bound .",
    "* it is difficult to include fluctuations and correlations ; the bk equation represents a mean field approximation .",
    "* they can only describe inclusive features , and not the production of exclusive final states . *",
    "analytic calculations are mainly applicable at extreme energies , well beyond what can be reached experimentally .",
    "non - leading effects , effects of energy conservation and a running coupling , are often easier included in monte carlo simulations .",
    "a simulation of muller s cascade model has been presented by salam @xcite . however , as the dipole splitting diverges for small dipole sizes , @xmath44 , ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dipolesplit ] ) ) this simulation is hampered by numerical difficulties .",
    "it is noticed that the fluctuations in the number of dipoles is very large , which causes serious problems .",
    "in refs .  @xcite we describe a modification of mueller s cascade model with the following features :    * it includes essential nll bfkl effects . *",
    "it includes non - linear effects in the evolution . *",
    "it includes essential correlations and fluctuations .",
    "* it can also describe exclusive final states .",
    "the model is also implemented in a monte carlo simulation program . here",
    "the nll effects significantly reduce the production of small dipoles , and thereby also the associated numerical difficulties with very large dipole multiplicities are avoided .",
    "confinement corrections are also included , but this is numerically less important than nll and non - linear effects .",
    "the nll corrections to bfkl evolution have three major sources @xcite :    * _ the running coupling . _ + this is relatively easily included in a mc simulation process . *",
    "_ non - singular terms in the splitting function . _",
    "+ these terms suppress large @xmath45-values in the individual branchings , and prevent the daughter from being faster than her recoiling parent .",
    "most of this effect is taken care of by including energy - momentum conservation in the evolution .",
    "* _ projectile - target symmetry .",
    "_ + this is also called energy scale terms , and is essentially equivalent to the so called consistency constraint .",
    "this effect is taken into account by conservation of both positive and negative lightcone momentum components , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the treatment of these effects includes effects beyond nll , in a way similar to the treatment by salam in ref .",
    "thus the power @xmath48 , determining the growth for small @xmath49 , is not negative for large values of @xmath50 .",
    "as mentioned above , dipole loops within the evolution , as indicated by the letter @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalstate ] , are not included in mueller s cascade model or in the jimwlk or bk equations . like for dipole scattering the probability for such loops",
    "is given by @xmath50 , and therefore formally colour suppressed compared to dipole splitting , which is proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "these loops are therefore related to the probability that two dipoles have the same colour .",
    "two dipoles with the same colour form a quadrupole .",
    "such a field may be better approximated by two dipoles formed by the closest colour - anticolour charges .",
    "this corresponds to a recoupling of the colour dipole chains , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : swing ] .",
    "we call this process a dipole `` swing '' .",
    "although this mechanism does not give an explicitly frame independent result , mc simulations show that it is a very good approximation ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmatot ] below ) .",
    "we note that in this formulation the number of dipoles is not reduced .",
    "the saturation effect is obtained because the swing favours the formation of smaller dipoles , which have a smaller cross section .",
    "thus in an evolution in momentum space the swing would not correspond to an absorption of gluons below the saturation line @xmath52 ; it would rather correspond to lifting the gluons to higher @xmath7 above this line .",
    "the exchange of massless gluons gives an interaction of infinite range , which eventually will violate froissart s bound .",
    "this long range interaction is suppressed by introducing an effective gluon mass .",
    "thus the gluon propagater @xmath53 is replaced by @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that the expression for the transverse electric field in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efield ] ) should be replaced by @xmath55 , and in the interaction probability in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intprob ] ) the logarithms @xmath56 are replaced by @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are modified bessel functions . for small values of @xmath44",
    "the expressions are unchanged , but when @xmath44 becomes larger than @xmath61 they become exponentially suppressed .      as the size of a dipole",
    "is also associated with ( the inverse of ) its transverse momentum , the event depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalstate ] can also be interpreted as an exclusive final state with definite parton momenta .",
    "it is true that taking the fourier transform is not exactly the same as replacing @xmath23 by @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , when there is a conflict , what we really are generating is perhaps not @xmath44 with the approximation @xmath63 , but rather generating @xmath7 with @xmath64 .",
    "there are also some other problems which have to be solved . in the evolution of a particle with a high value for the lightcone momentum , @xmath46 , but very little @xmath47",
    ", the gluons in the cascade will accumulate a large deficit of @xmath47 , which has to be `` payed back '' when it collides with a target having a large @xmath47 but small @xmath46 .",
    "dipole chains like the ones indicated by @xmath11 and @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalstate ] , which do not interact , can not come on shell and have to be treated as virtual .",
    "thus only gluons which are connected to daughters involved in the collisions should be included in the initial state radiation .",
    "an important feature is that all dipoles are connected in chains , which implies strong non - trivial correlations @xcite .",
    "a toy model calculation by r. corke @xcite shows that such correlations can have a big effect on the need for colour reconnections in the final state .",
    "the full calculation of the final state properties is not yet implemented in the mc , but will be ready in the near future .",
    "for the results presented in this section we have used a simple model for the proton wave function , in form of three dipoles in an equilateral triangle . for larger @xmath65 the wavefunction for a virtual photon",
    "is determined by perturbation theory , but for smaller @xmath65 it is necessary to include a nonperturbative component representing the soft hadronic part of the photon . for more details",
