    "the `` pitch - drop - experiment '' @xcite , which received the ig - nobel price in physics 2005 , has brought to the attention that a fast process like drop formation @xcite can be retarded considerably if instead of a standard liquid like water  it has a viscosity of @xmath0 at @xmath1c  a material like pitch , with a viscosity around @xmath2 is selected .",
    "the funnel was filled in 1930 @xcite , and today `` finally the ninth pitch drop has fallen from the world s longest running lab experiment '' @xcite and the 10th is awaited within the next 14 years . here the question arises whether those high viscosities may give access to so far not resolved phenomena .     in a vessel with diameter of 120 mm .",
    "the picture is taken from @xcite .",
    "a movie showing the formation of rosensweig patterns can be accessed at  @xcite.,width=323 ]    in the following we are investigating this question for the case of the well known rosensweig or normal field instability @xcite .",
    "it is observed in a horizontal layer of magnetic fluid ( mf ) @xcite with a free surface , when a critical value @xmath3 of the vertically oriented magnetic induction is surpassed .",
    "figure  [ fig : peaks ] presents a photo of the final hexagonal arrangement of static liquid peaks . beside the threshold ,",
    "beyond which the instability occurs , two quantities characterizing the emerging pattern have been in the focus of various studies : the critical wave number of the peaks and the corresponding growth rate , where both are strongly influenced by the viscosity of the magnetic fluid .",
    "that essential role of the viscosity for the dynamics of the pattern formation is reflected in the course of the analyses devoted to the rosensweig instability .",
    "for an inviscid magnetic fluid ( the dynamic viscosity @xmath4 is zero ) and an infinitely deep container , @xcite provide a linear stability analysis already in the very first description of the normal field instability to find the critical threshold @xmath3 and the critical wave number @xmath5 .",
    "this approach has been extended later by @xcite to fluids with non - zero viscosity , where the growth rate depends on @xmath4 , and to a finite depth of the container by @xcite .",
    "first experimental investigations on the growth of the pattern are provided by @xcite , who also derive the growth rate for the case of a viscous magnetic fluid and an arbitrary layer thickness @xmath6 .",
    "this theoretical analysis has been later extended to the case of a nonlinear magnetization curve @xmath7 by @xcite .    whereas so far the growth rate of the emerging rosensweig pattern has been measured utilizing ferrofluids with @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite we are tackling here the growth process in a ferrofluid which is a thousand times more viscous than the first one .",
    "such a ferrofluid is being created by cooling a commercially available viscous ferrofluid ( apg e32 from ferrotec co. ) down to @xmath10c .",
    "the ferrofluid has now a viscosity of @xmath11 .",
    "in such a cooled rosensweig ( sloppy _ frozensweig _ ) instability @xcite the growth of the pattern takes 60 seconds and can be measured with high temporal resolution in the extended system using a two - dimensional x - ray imaging technique @xcite .",
    "that technique provides the full surface topography , as opposed to the fast , but one dimensional hall - sensor array , which had to be utilized for the low viscosity ferrofluids @xcite .",
    "the potential of the retarded instability was demonstrated before @xcite , when the coefficients of nonlinear amplitude equations were determined in this way .",
    "in addition a sequence of localized patches of rosensweig pattern could be uncovered most recently @xcite with that technique .",
    "here we exploit a higher viscosity to investigate the linear growth rate in a regime , which was hitherto not accessible .",
    "this expectation is based on a scaling analysis presented in ref.@xcite . for supercritical inductions larger than @xmath12 ( the dimensionless kinematic viscosity @xmath13 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling_visc ] ) below ) the behavior of the growth rate is characterized by a _",
    "square - root _ dependence on those inductions , as confirmed in @xcite .",
    "contrary , for supercritical inductions smaller than @xmath12 the behavior of the growth rate is characterized by a _",
    "linear _ dependence . in the present experiment we increase @xmath12 by six orders of magnitude due to the high viscosity of the ferrofluid apg e32 at @xmath10c .",
    "thus a new territory of linear scaling is open for exploration .",

    "the experimental setup for the measurements of the surface topography consists of an tailor made x - ray apparatus described in detail before @xcite .",
    "an x - ray point source emits radiation vertically from above through the container filled with the mf . underneath the container ,",
    "an x - ray camera records the radiation passing through the layer of mf .",

    "the container is surrounded by a helmholtz - pair - of - coils , thermally isolated from the vessel with a ring made from the flame resistant material ` fr-2 ` .",
    "the size of the coils is adapted to the size of the vessel in order to introduce a `` magnetic ramp '' at the edge of the vessel .",
    "this technique , as described more detailed in ref.@xcite , serves to minimize distortions by compensating partly the jump of the magnetization at the container edge .",
    "filling the container to a height of @xmath22 with ferrofluid enhances the magnetic induction in comparison with the empty coils for the same current @xmath23 .",

    "obviously this systematic deviation is not matched by eq.([eq : hat_omega2_hatm ] ) . as a possible origin for",
    "the different inclinations one may suspect that utilizing the static surface tension in eq.([eq : hat_omega2_hatm ] ) is not a sufficient approximation .",
    "indeed during the growth of the peaks new surface area is generated , and the diffusion of surfactants from the bulk of the ferrofluid towards the surface may lag behind . similarly during the decay of the peaks surface area is annihilated and the surface density of surfactants may there exceed the equilibrium concentration . therefore we adopt a growth - rate - dependent dynamic surface tension according to @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes the static surface tension and @xmath117 a coefficient of dimension @xmath118 . in fig.[fig : growthrate_comparison ] the orange dashed line marks the outcome of the fit .",

    "growthrate_comparison ] a fit by eq.([eq : dyn.eta ] ) is marked by the solid blue line .",
    "obviously this phenomenological ansatz meets the data remarkeably well .      a possible explanation of this complex behaviour is based upon the formation of chains of magnetic particles , which is indicated by the enhanced shear thinning as recorded in fig.[fig : shear.thinning ]",
    ". the chain formation will be most prominent in the higher magnetic field in the spikes at the starting amplitude @xmath122 , marked in fig.[fig : frozenprotocol ] .",
    "these chains are then increasing the magnetoviscosity during the decay of the spikes , which retards the decay ( cf.path @xmath123__2 _ _ and @xmath123__3b _ _ in fig.[fig : frozenprotocol ] ) . during the decay",
    "they are partially destroyed . as a consequence , after switching again to an overcritical induction , the growth of the spikes ( path @xmath124__3a _ _ ) is comparatively faster . in contrast , our theory is based on newtonian fluids .",
    "an extension to shear thinning and structured liquids has still to be developed .",
    "we are next comparing the critical inductions in the last column of table [ tab : fit.para ] .",
    "the static fit of the growth process yields @xmath125 and deviates by only 1% from the mean value @xmath126 obtained by a fit of the full dynamics by means of amplitude equations in ref.@xcite .",
    "all other values for @xmath3 underestimate this value slightly more ( cf.line 2 - 4 ) . in the latter three cases the growth _ and _",
    "decay was taken into account .",
    "this is a conformation , that mainly the decay is affected by chain formation in the spikes .",
    "eventually we will not hide _ four _ further effects which may have impact on our experiment :    _ first _ , the experiments are performed in a finite container which comprises only 27 spikes on a hexagonal lattice , whereas the theory considers a laterally infinite layer .",
    "our finite circular size does indeed suppress the onset of a hexagonal pattern , due to the ramp described above .",
    "_ second _ , by seeding a regular hexagonal pattern at large amplitude the selected wavelength may differ from the wavelength of maximal growth .",
    "this can in principle shift the experimental threshold towards higher values .",
    "however , it was demonstrated by linear stability analysis that this effect can be neglected in the limit of high viscosities @xcite .",
    "_ third _ , magnetophoresis may take place in the crests of the pattern , in this way creating an inhomogeneous distribution of magnetite . even though the timescale for separation in a low viscous mf comprise days @xcite and our measurements",
    "last only hours , an effect can not completely excluded .",
    "a _ fourth _ reason may be that instead of the shear viscosity the extensional viscosity has to be taken into account in eq.([eq : disprel ] ) .",
    "indeed , besides a small viscous sublayer , the flow profile of surface waves can `` be described by a potential and is rotational free and purely elongational '' @xcite .",
    "most recently a capillary - break - up - extensional - rheometer was subjected to magnetic fields oriented along the direction of the capillary @xcite . for increasing fields an enlarged elongational viscosity was observed .",
    "this effect was also attributed to chain formation .",
    "however , to measure the elongational viscosity of ferrofluids is a difficult task , and sensitive devices have still to be developed .",
    "using a highly viscous magnetic fluid , the dynamics of the formation of the rosensweig instability can be slowed down to the order of minutes . therefore , it is possible to measure the dynamics using a two - dimensional imaging technique , in contrast to previous work @xcite , where only a one - dimensional cut through the two - dimensional pattern was accomplished . by means of a specific measurement protocol",
    "we were able to seed regular patterns of small amplitude , suitable for a comparison with linear theory . from the evolution of their amplitudes",
    "we could estimate the linear growth and decay rates , respectively . our experiment confirmed for the very first time a _ linear _ scaling of the growth rate with the magnetic inductions , as predicted @xcite for the immediate vicinity of the bifurcation point .",
    "thus the scaling behavior of the growth rate is now confirmed for supercritical magnetizations not only above @xcite but also below the boundary of the two scaling regimes at @xmath12 .    additionally , we uncovered , that the rates of growth and decay are slightly different , a phenomenon not predicted by the theory .",
    "a possible origin of this discrepancy is the formation of chains of magnetic particles .",
    "their presence in our ferrofluid is indicated by the magnetically enhanced shear thinning .",
    "the build up of chains in the static spikes , and their subsequent destruction during the decay may change the effective viscosity of the structured ferrofluid , and thus explain the deviations .",
    "so far our theory is based on newtonian liquids .",
    "an extension to shear thinning and structured ferrofluids is referred to future investigations",
    ". it may be able to reproduce the scaling of the effective viscosity as described phenomenologically by eq.([eq : scaling_visc ] ) .",
