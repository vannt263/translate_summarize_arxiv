    "<S> bani@xmath0as@xmath0 , with a first order phase transition around 131  k , is studied by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the measured electronic structure is compared to the local density approximation calculations , revealing similar large electronlike bands around @xmath1 and differences along @xmath2-@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the electronic structure of bani@xmath0as@xmath0 is distinct from that of the sibling iron pnictides . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , there is no signature of band folding , indicating no collinear sdw related magnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , across the strong first order phase transition , the band shift exhibits a hysteresis , which is directly related to the significant lattice distortion in bani@xmath0as@xmath0 . </S>"
