    "electronic states of atoms and molecules are characterized in the lowest level of approximation ( the mean field or hartree - fock description ) in terms of electron occupancy of single particle states corresponding to motion in an average potential .",
    "thus , for example , the ground state of the helium atom is described as @xmath0 @xmath1 viz two electrons in the spin singlet state in the lowest single particle orbital ( in conformity with the pauli exclusion principle ) .",
    "the first excited state is that of the excited configuration expressed in the standard spectroscopic notation as @xmath2 @xmath3 and so on .",
    "various excited states of the helium atom may be excited from the ground state through the scattering of electrons or photons from the helium atom and would show up as peaks ( or breit - wigner resonances ) in the scattering cross - section , as also via the excitation spectrum mapping the inelastic processes .",
    "of course our description through the electronic configuration is only approximate and the true state is better described theoretically by considering the effect of perturbations caused by the interactions beyond the mean field resulting in the mixing of configurations .",
    "a qualitatively different situation arises , however , when we consider the excitation of a sufficiently high lying ( energy wise ) configuration , say for instance the @xmath4 @xmath5 state of the helium atom which possesses an energy above the lowest ionization threshold of helium .",
    "such a state if excited would be auto - ionizing viz .",
    "would decay into @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , these manifest themselves as highly asymmetric peaks in the excitation spectrum .",
    "a qualitative understanding of this phenomenon was provided by rice @xcite and by fano @xcite .",
    "quantitative treatment of the process , rendered somewhat subtle by the fact that it involves the mixing between a discrete state and a continuum ( with an attendant degeneracy in energy ) had to await almost a quarter of a century @xcite .",
    "there has been renewed interest in the fano resonance in recent years in connection with interference effects in the quantum dot @xcite and in the aharonov - bohm ring with a quantum dot embedded in one arm@xcite .",
    "accordingly , it is desirable to expose the essence of the mechanism underlying the fano resonance through exactly soluble models avoiding complications existing in realistic systems inessential for a basic understanding of the highly asymmetric excitation spectrum for a quasi - bound state lying in the continuum . in order to obtain a simple realisation of such a situation",
    "consider the elastic scattering of a particle by a target system describable in terms of a potential @xmath7 .",
    "suppose that the target has an excited state of energy @xmath8 above its ground state .",
    "when the projectile energy @xmath9 is above the threshold @xmath8 then , apart from the elastic scattering the inelastic process is also possible .",
    "one may describe the situation in terms of two channels , the elastic and the inelastic .",
    "the latter channel corresponds to the scattering of the projectile of energy @xmath10 from the excited state of the system through a potential @xmath11 , while the two channels are coupled to each other via a potential @xmath12 . with @xmath13 and @xmath14 denoting the states in the elastic and inelastic channels respectively , the system is governed by the coupled schrdinger equations    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the kinetic energy operator for the projectile .",
    "now if the projectile and excited target system interacting via the potential @xmath11 has a bound state whose energy will naturally be below @xmath8 then we do have a situation where the would - be bound state of the excited channel lies in the continuum of the elastic channel , the desideratum for a fano resonance .",
    "we shall consider three illustrations by choosing the underlying potentials and show that the probability for the excitation of the quasi - bound auto - ionizing state ( so to say ) exhibits a resonance at some energy @xmath17 with a finite width @xmath18 corresponding to a complex pole of the corresponding amplitude of the form @xmath19 similar to what occurs in breit - wigner resonance .",
    "however , that apart the amplitude also possesses a concomitant zero at some real energy @xmath20 near the resonance energy @xmath21 .",
    "it is the juxtaposition of a complex pole and a real zero of the excitation probability in the energy plane which gives rise to the observed highly asymmetric peak as the energy passes through that corresponding to the auto - ionizing level .",
    "the generic pole - zero structure of the amplitude can be encapsulated in the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 measuring the separation of the energy from the resonance position in units of @xmath24 viz . @xmath25 ( the reduced energy variable ) and the asymmetry described by the fano parameter @xmath26 .",
    "whence the excitation line shapes in the neighbourhood of the fano resonance is given by @xmath27 wherein to emphasize the main features the other weakly varying factors have been appropriately factored out",
    ". these line shapes @xcite for different values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath28 are shown in fig .",

    "we consider a soluble realisation of the two channel problem with a particle of mass @xmath31 moving in one dimension where we take @xmath32 while @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "taking @xmath32 is tantamount to saying that scattering in the elastic channel is only due to its coupling to the inelastic channel ; this extreme simplification is to set forth in bold relief the fano mechanism as in such a situation the bound state in the continuum plays a central role since but for the coupling between channels there is no effect ( scattering ) in the elastic channel . defining @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and",

    "accordingly , the decay rate for the ` auto - ionizing ' state to go into the continuum is given by @xmath80 in agreement with our earlier result describing the excursion of the pole into the complex plane .",
    "further one may use perturbation theory to verify that the shift in the real part of energy to order @xmath81 is zero .    in order to understand the origin of the fano zero",

    "it needs to be emphasized that @xmath85 here is not an eigenvalue to be determined but it is fixed given the energy @xmath86 of the incident beam .",
    "the open channel solutions @xmath87 correspond to continuum states while the closed or evanescent channel function @xmath88 is exponentially damped .",
    "however , since we are concerned with the mixing between @xmath87 & @xmath88 pertaining to a bound state in the continuum we must adopt a scheme for the normalisation of the two functions treated at par .",
    "this is indeed what is proposed by bayman & mehoke @xcite where the open channels are normalized to unit flux and the closed channels with an analogous factor ( which would result from analytic continuation ) .",
    "thus with @xmath89 & @xmath90 being the probability amplitudes ( or mixing coefficients ) to be determined ,    @xmath91    which when substituted in the system equations ( [ eq : sch1nn ] & [ eq : sch2nn ] ) yield    @xmath92    it may be observed that @xmath93 in view of unitarity since the inelastic channel is closed ( or evanescent ) .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath94 we have @xmath95 which means that the bound state decouples and probability to be in the elastic channel is unity .",
    "when we try to access the bound state embedded in the continuum through elastic scattering ( or other processes ) the transition probability will involve the overlap integral .",

    "this is the celebrated fano zero with the experimental signature that the line shape for excitation of the auto - ionizing state vanishes at some energy @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , it may also be observed that the transmission amplitude , @xmath102 ( see appendix a ) has a zero at @xmath103 . to form a picture of the composite situation that has emerged it is worthwhile to look at this again for small @xmath104 whence we find that the fano - zero is located at @xmath105 $ ] as compared to the resonance energy @xmath106 $ ] and the width @xmath107 with the fano parameter @xmath108 .",
    "it is evident from the above discussion that the essence of the fano zero lies in the mixing between the continuum states of the elastic channel and quasi - bound ` discrete ' state of the inelastic channel .",
    "this is well expressed by ugo fano @xcite :  repulsion ( of levels ) is familiar in discrete spectra , when a level of one configuration happens to lie in the midst of a series of levels of other configurations ; configuration interaction causes the levels of the second series to be shifted away from the perturbing level .",
