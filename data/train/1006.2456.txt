    "in the last few years , the sznajd sociophysics model @xcite has been successfully applied to many different areas , like politics , marketing and finance ( for reviews , see @xcite and more recently @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of the model is the emergence of consensus from simple microscopic rules based on an ising - type model .",
    "after the introduction of the original one - dimensional model in 2000 @xcite , many modifications were proposed , like the extension to the square @xcite , triangular @xcite and cubic lattices @xcite , the increase of the range of the interaction @xcite and the number of variable s states @xcite , adding diffusion @xcite , and others .",
    "the sznajd model defined on the square lattice was firstly studied by stauffer _",
    "_ @xcite . considering that a @xmath1 plaquette with all spins parallel can convince their eight neighbors ( we can call this stauffer s rule )",
    ", the authors found a phase transition for initial density of up spins @xmath2 .",
    "the two - dimensional model was also considered in a randomly diluted square lattice @xcite , where every site may carries one spin or is empty . a situation with long - range correlations between the occupation of various lattice sizes",
    "was also considered , but in both cases the results are very similar to those on regular lattices @xcite . a more realistic situation is to consider a probability of persuasion .",
    "the sznajd model is robust against this situation : if one convinces the neighbors only with some probability @xmath3 , and leaves them unchanged with probability @xmath4 , still a consensus is reached after a long time @xcite .",
    "models that consider many different opinions ( using potts spins , for example ) or defined on small - world networks were studied in order to represent better approximations of real communities behavior ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in order to avoid full consensus in the system , and makes the model more realistic , schneider introduced opportunists and persons in opposition @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the dynamics of social relationships in the real world shows a large number of details that are commonly neglected in some theoretical models . in order to introduce a more realistic feature , we have considered in this work a reputation mechanism that limits the capacity of persuasion of the agents .",
    "it is expected that the inclusion of reputation in the sznajd model turns it closer to a real social system , where not only the number of individuals with same opinion matters .",
    "we believe that the reputation of the agents who holds same opinion is an important factor in persuasion across the community . in other words , it is realistic to believe that individuals change their opinions if they are influenced by high - reputation persons .",
    "in fact , we show that a democracy - like situation , with a ferromagnetic ordering with not all spins parallel , is possible considering simple microscopic rules .    this letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the model and define their microscopic rules .",
    "the numerical results as well as the finite - size scaling analysis are discussed in section 3 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "we have considered the sznajd model defined on a square lattice with linear size @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath6 _ agents _ ) .",
    "our model is based on the stauffer s rule ( rule ia of the model in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , an integer number ( @xmath7 ) labels each player and represents its reputation across the community , in analogy to the naming game model considered by brigatti @xcite .",
    "the reputation is introduced as a score which is time - dependent .",
    "the agents start with a random distribution of the @xmath7 values , and during the time evolution , the reputation of each agent changes according to its capacity to be persuasive , following the rules explained below .    at each time step",
    ", the following microscopic rules control our model :    1 .",
    "we randomly choose a 2 @xmath8 2 plaquette of four neighbors .",
    "if not all four center spins are parallel , leaves its eight neighbors unchanged .",
    "if all four center spins are parallel , we calculate the average reputation of the plaquette : @xmath9 where each term @xmath10 represents the reputation of one of the plaquettes agents .. ] 4 .   in this case , we compare the reputations of each one of the eight neighbors with the average reputation .",
    "if the reputation of a neighbor is less than the average one , this neighbor follows the plaquette orientation .",
    "for each persuaded individual , each one of the plaquette agents increase their reputations by 1 ( in other words , the average reputation of the plaquette is increased by 1 ) .",
    "thus , even in the case where all plaquettes spins are parallel , a different number of agents may be convinced , namely , 8 , 7 , 6 , ... , 1 or 0 ones .",
    "as pointed by stauffer @xcite , we can imagine that each agent in the sznajd model carries an opinion , that can either be up ( e.g. republican ) or down ( e.g. democrat ) and that represents one of two possible opinions on any question .",
    "the objective of the agents in this _ game _ is to convince their neighbors of their opinion .",
    "one can expect that , if a certain group of agents convince many other agents , their persuasion abilities increase .",
    "thus , the inclusion of reputation in the model may capture this real - world characteristic .",
    ", initial densities of up spins @xmath11 and @xmath12 and different samples ( left side ) .",
    "we can see that the steady states show situations where the total consensus is not obtained , in opposition of the standard sznajd model defined on the square lattice @xcite . in the right side",

    ", we can start studying the time evolution of the magnetization , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total number of agents and @xmath19 . in the standard sznajd model defined on the square lattice @xcite , the application of the stauffer s rule , where a @xmath1 plaquette convince its eight neighbors if all spins are parallel , with initial density of up spins @xmath2 leads the system to the fixed points with all up or all down spins with equal probability . for @xmath20 ( @xmath21 )",
    "the system goes to a ferromagnetic state with all spins down ( up ) in all samples , which characterizes a phase transition at @xmath2 in the limit of large @xmath5 .",
    "as pointed by the authors in @xcite , fixed points with all spins parallel describe the published opinion in a dictatorship , which is not a commom situation nowadays .",
    "however , ferromagnetism with not all spins parallel corresponds to a democracy , which is very commom in our world .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the behavior of the magnetization as a function of time in our model , considering the above - mentioned rules . in the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show a value of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , and one can see that the total consensus with all spins up ( down ) will not be achieved in any sample , indicating that ( i ) a democracy - like situation is possible in the model without the consideration of a mixing of different rules @xcite , or some kind of special agents , like contrarians and opportunists @xcite , and ( ii ) if a phase transition also occurs in our case , the transition point will be located somewhere at @xmath22 .",
