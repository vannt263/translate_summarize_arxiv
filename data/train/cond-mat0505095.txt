    "research on intermetallic clathrate compounds with general formula a@xmath0x@xmath1x@xmath2 ( a = ba , sr , eu ; x = al , ga , in ; x = si , ge , sn ) has increased significantly over the past 10 years , since the proposal that the generic class of caged compounds with guest atoms might be good candidates to fulfill the phonon - glass electron - crystal ( pgec ) concept of a thermoelectric material with potential for applications @xcite .",
    "the cages in these clathrates are formed by xx host atoms connected through diamond - like hybridized orbitals , while the a guest atom lies within the cage and donates two electrons to it . for each divalent a ion in this particular family , the replacement of two x atoms with x ions in the cage appears to be the required charge - balance condition for these two electrons to be accepted and for the structure to be stabilized .",
    "the potential phonon - glass behavior results from the fact that the a@xmath3 ion can in certain cases be loosely bound inside a cage that is slightly oversized in comparison with its ionic radius , and is thus able to achieve a rather independent `` rattling '' motion that tends to scatter low - frequency acoustic phonons , responsible for a good fraction of the heat conduction in a crystalline lattice @xcite . in the case of sr@xmath0ga@xmath1ge@xmath2 and eu@xmath0ga@xmath1ge@xmath2 ,",
    "the additional presence of a four - fold splitting of an a atom site and the consequent tunnelling of this ion between these four off - center sites is claimed to be the source of truly glass - like behavior in their thermal conductivities at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the electron - crystal characteristic of these clathrates is preserved because the charge carriers remain within the cage network and are not significantly affected by the rattling motion of the guest atom .",
    "we have recently reported a thorough characterization of the basic physical properties of the type - viii clathrate ba@xmath0ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 , grown as large single crystals out of sn flux @xcite .",
    "electron probe microanalysis ( epma ) showed that these crystals grew with composition very close to 8:16:30 despite the excess sn flux , confirming the relevance of the above mentioned charge balance in the stabilization of the structure .",
    "these crystals showed behavior consistent with a heavily - doped @xmath4-type semiconductor with large negative thermopower and negative hall coefficient .",
    "they also showed low lattice thermal conductivity of order 1  w / m  k resultant from the rattling of ba ions , which was evidenced by large isotropic displacement parameters in single crystal x - ray diffraction analysis and the presence of einstein vibrational degrees of freedom in heat capacity analysis .    towards the end of the experimental investigations for that work , we also succeeded in growing single crystalline ba@xmath0ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 out of ga flux , and epma analysis once again showed a crystal composition very close to 8:16:30 . since these ga - flux crystals did not grow as easily or as large as the sn - flux ones , and the final composition was not significantly changed , they were not investigated in detail for that initial characterization . however , a recent study of sintered samples of ba@xmath0ga@xmath5sn@xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the _ nominal _ composition ) showed that the carrier changes from electron - type for @xmath8 to hole - type for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this result invited a more careful investigation on the dependence of our crystal s properties with their growth conditions .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend and complete the basic characterization of single crystalline ba@xmath0ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 with a comparative study between sn - flux and ga - flux grown crystals .",
    "we will show that the transport properties are in fact highly sensitive to composition and/or growth conditions , and thus this material has a potential _ tunability _ that may in principle allow significant improvements in terms of its thermoelectric performance , in conjunction with other materials science techniques for such .",
    "four single crystal batches were prepared and measured for this work : two using excess sn flux and two using excess ga flux .",
    "samples from these batches will be referred to as sn#1 , sn#2 , ga#1 and ga#2 respectively .",
    "sn#1 samples are from the same crystal growth described in detail in the previous work @xcite using a ba : ga : sn starting proportion of 8:16:60 , and sn#2 samples are from a second batch of crystals grown essentially by the same route . with sn flux",
    "the crystals tend to grow very large ( limited mostly by the total mass of the starting reagents and by the quartz tube size of order 10  mm in diameter ) and have very well defined polyhedral surface facets .    for the ga#1 and ga#2 growths",
    "the starting elemental proportions were 8:26:30 and 8:50:30 respectively .",
    "the high - purity elements were sealed in evacuated quartz tubes , soaked above 1150  @xmath10c for 2 - 3 hours , cooled over 10 hours to 550  @xmath10c and then slowly cooled over 100 hours to 420  @xmath10c . at this point",
    "the ampoules are quickly removed from the furnace and the remaining molten ga flux separated by centrifuging .",
    "if the crystals did not grow to sufficient size in this first round , the solidified material was resealed with enough new ga to complete the initial ba : ga : sn proportion once again , and only the second part of the ramp was repeated .",
    "polyhedral crystals grown from this approach were never larger than about 3 mm in diameter , and usually much smaller",
    ". some of our growth attempts also resulted in large plate - like crystals rather than the expected polyhedrons .",
    "epma analysis showed that these plates are a new compound baga@xmath11sn , which we intend to characterize and describe in a future communication .    to ensure the best possible reliability of a comparative epma evaluation of the sn- and ga - flux grown ba@xmath0ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 crystals",
    ", we mounted one crystal from each batch on a single sample holder and measured all four in a single experimental session at a jeol jxa-8200 microanalyzer , using the same reference materials for ba , ga and sn . the results ( averaged over 5 different regions for each crystal ) are shown in table  [ epma ] . all crystal composition remain close to the nominal 8:16:30 proportion , but there are clear distinctions .",
    "sample sn#1 is , within experimental error , in the ideal stoichiometry .",
    "samples sn#2 and ga#1 show an average slight excess of sn and ga respectively , and sample ga#2 showed the greatest off - stoichiometry composition ( excess ga ) .    .[epma ] relative ba : ga : sn content in the four measured crystals as determined by electron - probe microanalysis , and fermi energies derived from thermopower analysis .

    "the average voltage was obtained from measurements with the current ( 1 - 10 ma ) applied in opposite directions .",
    "thermopower from 4 - 300  k was measured by a differential method , performed on a home - made probe inserted into a glass cryostat .",
    "the bar - shaped samples were suspended between two electrically isolated copper blocks , across which a temperature difference of 0.05 - 0.3  k was applied . hall coefficient from 4 - 300  k was measured on a home - made probe by a dc technique in a field of 1  t applied by a conduction magnet .",

    "they are in the m@xmath14  cm range and show monotonically decreasing values upon cooling , characteristic of heavily - doped semiconductors or low carrier - density metals",
    ". since these are large , dense and carefully cut samples , ( rectangular cross - sections of order @xmath15  mm@xmath16 ) the uncertainty in estimating the geometrical factor @xmath17 is relatively small ( less than 5% ) , so the differences observed in the calculated resistivities should not be resultant from trivial geometrical uncertainty .",
    "the quasi - stoichiometric sn#1 sample has the highest resistivity , consistent with the idea that the ideal material tends towards a narrow - gap semiconductor . but",
    "none of the ba@xmath0ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 crystals grown so far have shown semi - conducting resistivity like that of ba@xmath0ga@xmath1ge@xmath2 @xcite , so the question remains open whether there is a true gap or a pseudo - gap in the ideal material .",
    "the sn#2 and ga#1 samples have smaller resistivities , as one would expect from the electron and hole doping effect of their respective off - stoichiometries , and the ga#2 sample has the lowest resistivity , consistent with its largest doping level .",
    "the differences between the type of charge carriers and its densities become much more evident in the thermopower measurements . in fig .",
    "[ thermo ] we show @xmath13 for the same samples in fig .",
    "as shown in the previous work , sn#1 sample has negative , monotonically decreasing thermopower in the entire temperature interval ( n - type carriers ) and reaches a relatively large magnitude of @xmath18v / k at 290  k. the sn#2 sample shows somewhat smaller but qualitatively similar behavior , reaching @xmath19v / k at 290  k. in contrast , the two ga flux samples show positive @xmath13 over the entire measured interval , indicating p - type carriers .",
    "sample ga#1 reaches @xmath20v / k at 290  k , while sample ga#1 remains below @xmath21v / k .",
    "the solid lines show the best fits of these @xmath13 curves to the equation    @xmath22    derived for a single parabolic band model @xcite , where @xmath23 is the fermi - dirac integral of order @xmath4 , and the only fitting parameter is the fermi energy @xmath24 , whose respective values are listed in table  [ epma ] .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this system should be better described by a two - band model though .",

    "the principle of operation of a thermoelectric cooling device requires a pair of materials , one n - type and one p - type , coupled electrically in series and thermally in parallel @xcite . the device s performance optimization involves not only the properties of each individual branch , but a combined optimization of the thermoelectric pair .",
    "thus , an important goal of research in this area is to not only find good thermoelectric materials of both carrier types , but also find materials that may be fine - tuned with respect to their figure of merit @xmath34 .",
    "our experiments show that ba@xmath0ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 samples may be a candidate to fulfill most of these requirements , if its present @xmath35 of order 0.15 at room temperature @xcite can be improved closer to unity .",
    "the existence of n - type and p - type samples has already been observed in sintered samples with nominal compositions ba@xmath0ga@xmath5sn@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it was reported that a gradual decrease of n - type carriers for @xmath36 is followed by a gradual increase of p - type carriers for @xmath37 , with a possible `` quasi - insulating '' region around @xmath38 .",
    "our results clearly show that the flux grown crystals are strikingly more sensitive in terms of sample composition , such that off - stoichiometries of @xmath39 from the ideal value are enough to cause the drastic change .",
    "this also raises the question of whether the largely deviated _ nominal _ compositions assumed in the polycrystals truly reflect their actual intra - grain clathrate compositions .",
    "if we can understand the reasons behind the observed differences in carriers and transport properties , we may be able to control these through the growth parameters and/or through post growth thermal treatment .",
    "the first issue is whether the observed differences are indeed primarily associated with off - stoichiometry .",
    "our experimental data give good evidence that there is in fact a correlation with the ga - sn proportion , such that the transport properties can be directly related to the ionic self - doping level .",
    "but the transport properties may not be directly related only to differences in composition .",
    "the next logical step is to account for differences in the distribution of ga - sn atoms throughout the cage structure .",
    "contrary to the ga - ge clathrates where , due to size similarity of these two atoms , they show mostly random distribution throughout all three crystallographic sites of the type - i clathrate structure ( although there are some indications of possible preferential occupations ) @xcite in ba@xmath0ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 the size difference between ga and sn ions is large enough that there is a clear preferential occupation of at least three of their four different sites in the type - viii clathrate structure .",
    "assuming that random occupation of a given site implies a proportion close to ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 in that site , the single crystal xrd refinement on the sn#2 crystal performed for the previous work @xcite revealed that sn tends to favor the x(1 ) site ( ga@xmath40sn@xmath41 ) and x(2 ) site ( ga@xmath42sn@xmath43 ) while ga tends to occupy the x(4 ) site ( ga@xmath44sn@xmath45 ) which has the shortest bond distances between neighbors , and the x(3 ) site remains more randomly occupied by both atoms ( ga@xmath46sn@xmath47 ) .",
    "we performed a preliminary comparative investigation of the sn#2 crystal before and after annealing for one week at 480  @xmath10c , which showed only a 12% decrease in its thermopower above room temperature , so that either the annealing condition was ineffective in significantly rearranging the as grown ga - sn distribution , or the differences in distribution may be indeed secondary with respect to thermoelectric properties , in comparison to composition differences .",
    "single crystals of ba@xmath0ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 grown from sn flux and ga flux have shown significantly different charge carrier densities and transport properties , which we could correlate to the relative ga - sn content in the crystals .",
    "the crossover between n - type and p - type carriers occurs within a very narrow range around the ideal 8:16:30 stoichiometry , in agreement with charge - balance principles and contrary to previously reported preliminary studies on sintered polycrystals .",
    "such characteristics point to the possibility of tuning the charge carrier nature and density , as well as the transport properties , through the sample preparation process and possibly through post growth annealings , a desirable feature in any material intended for thermoelectric applications .",
    "our next step is now to investigate the low - temperature heat capacity / conductance behavior of the carrier - tuned ba@xmath0ga@xmath1sn@xmath2 crystals , in search of further information on the vibrational behavior of the ba guests ions under different host cage environments .    to our satisfaction ,",
    "almost at the same time we first submitted this manuscript the research group from dresden published two excellent works @xcite describing how their polycrystalline eu@xmath0ga@xmath1ge@xmath2 samples can be tuned with respect to composition , carrier concentration and thermoelectric properties , although in their case only n - type samples were found .",
    "their results also challenge the current `` tunneling '' models for glass - like thermal conductivity ( which we mentioned in the introduction section ) attributing this low - temperature behavior to phonon - charge - carrier scattering instead .",
