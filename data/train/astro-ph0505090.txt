    "the sommerfeld fine - structure constant @xmath5 describes electromagnetic and optical properties of atoms and is the most suitable constant for time variation tests in the lab or for astronomical observations ( for a review see uzan 2003 ) .",
    "the value is @xmath6 ( mohr & tailor 2000 ) and laboratory experiments constrain its variability as @xmath7ln[@xmath8/dt = ( -0.9\\pm2.9_{\\rm stat})\\times10^{-15}$ ] yr@xmath9 ( fischer et al .",
    "this limit corresponds to @xmath10 for @xmath11 yr and @xmath12 varying linearly with time , which may be not the case .",
    "analysis of radioactive decay rates of nuclei in meteorites set @xmath13 ( olive et al . 2004 ) while a recent analysis of the isotopic abundances in the oklo samples ( @xmath14 yr ) suggests @xmath2@xmath15 ( lamoreaux & torgerson 2004 ) .",
    "shifts in the alkali doublets provide @xmath16 ( murphy et al . 2001 ) but the many - multiplet method applied to 143 absorption systems in the keck / hires spectra of quasars indicates a decrease of @xmath0 : @xmath17 in the redshift range @xmath18 ( murphy et al .",

    "however , vlt / uves observations of 23 absorption systems ( @xmath19 ) toward 18 qsos show no variability : @xmath20 ( chand et al 2004 ) . a first result of the new approach presented here applied to the system at @xmath1= 1.15 towards he05154414 ( @xmath21 ) was @xmath22 ( quast , reimers & levshakov 2004 ) , also showing no variability of @xmath0 .",
    "we use a modified many - multiplet procedure to calculate @xmath2 _ directly _ from the differences between the wavelengths of a pair of feii  transitions observed in the individual exposures .",

    "the relative abundance of the leading isotope @xmath23fe is higher ( terrestrial isotope ratios are @xmath24fe : @xmath23fe : @xmath25fe : @xmath26fe = 5.8 : 91.8 : 2.1 : 0.3 , and @xmath27 mg : @xmath28 mg : @xmath29 mg = 79 : 10 : 11 ) . ( _ ii _ ) the effects of possible inhomogeneous ionization structure within the absorber . ( _ iii _ ) for feii  the relativistic correction to the changes in @xmath0 ( @xmath30 coefficients ) are rather large . *",
    "why single exposures ?",
    "+ being applied to the lines from the _ same _ exposure , this method does not depend on the _ unknown offsets of the wavelength scale_. there are three main sources of potential systematic errors in the absolute velocity scale : ( @xmath31 ) temperature , ( @xmath32 ) air pressure instability , ( @xmath33 ) mechanical instabilities of unknown origin .",

    "we modified the uves pipeline to calibrate the echelle spectra without rebinning in wavelength to preserve the original pixel size : 50 m ( 3.3 km  s@xmath36/pix ) for the blue and 55 m ( 2.2 km  s@xmath36/pix ) for the red .",
    "typical rms of the wavelength calibration are of @xmath43  m ( @xmath44 m  s@xmath36 ) .",
    "we worked with individual exposures , since co - adding them cancels out original non - zero offsets and perturbs line centroids .",

    "measurements for q1101264 are combined with the feii  sample from the @xmath1= 1.15 system toward he05154414 ( qrl ) providing a total of 35 @xmath2values .",
    "the normalized distribution of the resulting 35 @xmath2values is plotted with histogram in fig .  1 .",

    "the vertical lines in this figure mark the centers of the corresponding distributions .",
    "our result is shown by the histogram and has the sample mean :      the scatter of @xmath2 in the keck sample is about 2 times the @xmath47 value of our combined feii  sample , but the sample means of cspa and our feii  ensemble are in good agreement .",

    "our result , and also the one of cspa , differ from that of mfwdpw at 95%   significance level according to the @xmath50-test .",
    "we also note that standard deviation in the cspa sample is exceptionally small somewhat in disagreement with their wavelength calibration accuracy .",
