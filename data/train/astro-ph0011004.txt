    "it is interesting to understand how the density profiles of galaxies and clusters of galaxies have formed .",
    "navarro , frenk and white ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ; nfw ) have shown in their n - body simulations of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the standard biased cdm and four power law spectra with indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 , open cdm ( @xmath3 ) with power - law spectra ( @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) , and @xmath5cdm cosmology that density profiles of dark halos have an universal profile described as @xmath6 several investigators have shown that the formula provides a good fit to their numerical results ( cole and lacey 1996 , tormen , bouchet & white 1997 , huss , jain & steinmmetz 1999 , thomas _ et al .",
    "however , some other simulations ( fukushige & makino 1997 ; moore et al . 1998 ; okamoto & habe 1999 , 2000 ) indicate that their density profiles have steeper inner cusp than the nfw profile .",
    "jing ( 2000 ) gives his numerical results that steeper cusps of density profile are found in recent mergers and in dark halos with substructures , by a large set of high resolution cosmological simulations .",
    "subramanian , cen and ostriker ( 2000 ) discussed the general theoretical grounds of the density profiles .",
    "they discussed that there is a possible connection between slope of inner region of dark halo and the formation epoch and proposed that there is possible relation to cosmological parameters .",
    "however , physical reason of the nfw profile have not been explored , although it is very important to understand formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "we study the differential energy distribution of the nfw profile , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the binding energy .",
    "the differential energy distribution was studied to understand virialization process of @xmath0- body system ( van albada 1982 ) .",
    "binney ( 1982 ) shows that @xmath9 of the elliptical galaxies is approximated by the boltzmann factor , if surface brightness of elliptical galaxies obeys the de vaucoureurs @xmath10 law and their mass - to - light ratio is constant .",
    "it is interesting to study phase space structure of virialized objects with the nfw profile , since the differential energy distribution may give insight of the relaxation process ( binney & tremain 1987 ) .    in this paper",
    "we calculate formation of clusters of galaxies by @xmath0-body simulation and we study the differential energy distribution of the clusters in our numerical results . we find an analytical formula of the fractional mass distribution that is defined by the differential distribution divided by mass of the object , is fitted by an analytical formula .",
    "we show that the nfw profile is consistent with our analytical formula of the fractional mass distribution . using the iteration method",
    ", we construct the density profile from the analytical formula to show how the slope of the cusp of the density changes with parameters in our analytical formula .    in the next section ,",
    "we illustrate our numerical method . in the section 3",

    "we show the iteration method and give results by this method in the section 4 , and we summarize and discuss our results in the section 5 .",
    "we use the hofman and ribak s ( hofman and ribak 1991 ) procedure to set initial conditions in order to have a massive dark halo near the centre of a simulation box .",
    "the cosmology is scdm model ( e.g. davis _ et al_. 1985 ) ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14,and @xmath15 ) .",
    "numerical simulations are carried out using grapesph code .",
    "grape is a special purpose hardware to calculate gravitation between n - body particles ( sugimoto _ et al_. 1990 ) .",
    "we combined smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) ( monaghan , 1992 ) with grape .",
    "we select massive halos of which mass is as large as that of cluster of galaxies and calculate their density profile and the fractional mass distribution .",
    "mass of a cdm particle and a sph particle are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "gravitational softening length is 100 kpc . both number of cdm and sph particles are 29855 , respectively .",
    "size of the simulation box is @xmath18 mpc .",
    "before we show our numerical results , we summarize the nfw profile .",
    "nfw proposed that the profile of the dark halo of cosmological object in their numerical results as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath22 is the critical density of the universe .",

    "nfw97 showed that the parameter @xmath21 decreases with halo mass .",

    "figure [ typical_density_profile_with_nfw ] shows a density profile of our simulated typical rich cluster , clc , and the nfw profile with @xmath34 which fits well the numerical result .",
    "density profiles of dark halos obtained by us agree well with the nfw profile in the range from the gravitational softening length to @xmath27 .",
    "we introduce the differential energy distribution , @xmath35 which gives the mass of dark matter in the dark halo with binding energy between @xmath8 and @xmath36 , where @xmath8 is the specific binding energy , @xmath37 and a relative potential , @xmath38 .",

    "we have shown from our @xmath0- body simulation that the fractional mass distribution is also well fitted by the equation ( [ escort ] ) . however , near @xmath59 in figure [ fractional_mass_distribution1 ] there are small number of @xmath0-body particles",

    "if we assume the density profile is the nfw profile , we get @xmath73 from the equations ( [ fe ] ) , ( [ dmde ] ) , and ( [ ge ] ) for the nfw profile .    figure [ fractional_mass_distribution2 ] shows the fractional mass distribution of nfw obtained in this way and @xmath48 given by equation ( [ escort ] ) .",
    "we show that @xmath48 given by equation ( [ escort ] ) is consistent with the nfw profile .",

    "although the distribution function of nfw profile have cut off at the high energy , the distribution function of king model does not have such cut off .",
    "this is an important difference between them .",
    "we find that the nfw profile satisfies the fractional mass distribution given by equation ( [ escort ] ) with @xmath54 .",

    "smaller @xmath57 ( e.g. @xmath99 ) results in shallower core in the inner region . on the other hand , larger @xmath57 ( @xmath100 ) makes a cusp steeper than the nfw profile , density profile approaches @xmath101 in the inner part , for @xmath102 .    for various values of @xmath58 ,",
    "the density profiles are similar to the nfw for @xmath103 as shown in figure [ e_density_relation ] .",

    "peak value of @xmath65 and the maximum binding energy of the distribution become large .",
    "we have shown that the density profile with large @xmath57 have the steep cusp .",
    "therefore , sharp peak of @xmath65 corresponds to the steep cusp .",
    "figure [ e_dependence_f ] shows @xmath41 obtained by the iteration method for same @xmath57 but various @xmath58 .",

    "we analyze the universal density profile of dark halo proposed by nfw and its differential energy distribution .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .    1",

    "different @xmath57 makes slope of a cusp different .",
    "since @xmath57 plays an important role , we should make clear what physical process determines @xmath57 .",
    "recent high resolution numerical simulation ( okamoto & habe 1999 , 2000 ) shows the steeper cusp , @xmath106 , than the the nfw profile .",

    ", resulting distribution is isothermal profile , @xmath110 . in this case",
    "the system has infinite extend and infinite mass .",
    "this is not realistic for astronomical objects .",
    "cosmological simulations have shown that galaxies and clusters of galaxies formed in these simulations have more rapid radial decline than isothermal in the outer part .",
    "we note that the form of the distribution function relates with the cusp profile . for @xmath111",
    ", there are the maximum binding energy @xmath112 and the sharp peak in @xmath65 at @xmath112 .",
    "since there is @xmath112 , phase space volume occupied by dark matter is limited than the isothermal profile .",
    "this may be the reason of the cusp profile different from @xmath101 . for @xmath111 , the distribution function @xmath65",
    "changes with @xmath57 values as shown in figure 8 .",
    "we note that the form of equations ( [ escort ] ) and ( [ escort_m ] ) are similar to the tsallis escort distribution , @xmath113^{q/(1-q)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is temperature parameter and @xmath57 is entropic index ( tsallis , mendes , & plastino , 1998 ) .",
    "tsallis non - extensive generalized statistics ( tsallis 1988 ) is paid attention in the area of statistics of a multi - fractal system . in non - extensive system ( long - range microscopy memory , long range forces , fractral space time )",

    "the escort distribution , @xmath122 , is similar to the form of equation ( [ escort ] ) and ( [ escort_m ] ) .",
    "it is expected that long range interaction makes the system non - extensive .",
    "our case may be the one of this cases .",
    "our results suggests that differential energy distribution of collisionless particles is described by the escort distribution of the tsallis statistics .",

    "there is a conjecture that @xmath57 of system approaches unity when the system proceeds relaxation ( tsallis 1999 ) .",
    "our results in which @xmath125 are consistent with this conjecture , since dark matter distribution in a cluster of galaxies is more relaxed system than the large scale motion of clusters of galaxies . the value of @xmath57 must be related with the degree of relaxation of collisionless particles .",
    "@xmath108 corresponds to isothermal distribution in the tsallis statistics .",
    "the gravitational system like clusters of galaxies with the universal profile may be non - extensive because they formed recently .",
    "we should study the reason why dark halo has the value of @xmath125 in the hierarchical clustering scenarios .",
