    "in this article , we are concerned with adaptively solving the maxwell equations for electromagnetic fields with arbitrary time dependence in a three - dimensional domain such that a prescribed error tolerance is respected . in order to achieve this goal the discontinuous galerkin method ( dgm )  @xcite",
    "is applied on anisotropic @xmath0-meshes , which dynamically and autonomously adapt as the electromagnetic fields evolve .",
    "the mesh refinement is driven by a robust local error estimate based on a modification of the so - called method of reference solutions  @xcite with largely reduced numerical costs .",
    "the dg method has gained wide acceptance as a high order numerical method , which is very well - suited for time - domain problems .",
    "it combines the usually opposing key features of high order accuracy and flexibility . in particular , the method can easily deal with meshes containing hanging nodes , which makes it particularly well suited for @xmath0-adaptivity .",
    "there is a well established body of literature on the dg method for various types of problems available .",
    "it has been thoroughly investigated by several research groups ( see  e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . concerning maxwell s equations in time - domain ,",
    "the dgm has been studied in particular in  @xcite .",
    "the latter two make use of hexahedral meshes , which allow for a computationally more efficient implementation  @xcite .",
    "the simplest approach to adapted grids consists of static _ a priori _ @xmath2-refinement around edges and corners , i.e. , the possible locations of field singularities  @xcite .",
    "while this approach mitigates negative effects of fields singularities on the global solution accuracy , the level of refinement to be applied for achieving a certain accuracy is unknown .",
    "moreover , edges and corners require no mesh refinement while there is no field , for instance , before illumination by a wave or after scattering took place .",
    "it also remains unclear how to choose polynomial orders in the remaining mesh .",
    "for these reasons our focus is on @xmath0-adaptivity based on error estimations of the time - dependent solution .",
    "mesh refinement and specifically @xmath0-adaptation has received considerable and continuous attention .",
    "the first published work on @xmath2- , @xmath1- and @xmath0-adaptivity within the dg framework is presumably @xcite , where the authors considered linear scalar hyperbolic conservation laws in two - dimensional space .",
    "hyperbolic problems have also been addressed , e.g. , by flaherty , shephard and co - workers who considered two - dimensional problems in  @xcite as well as three - dimensional settings with pure @xmath2-refinement in  @xcite .",
    "a large number of contributions has been authored by houston and various co - workers .",
    "they present a number of approaches to adaptivity and deal with first - order hyperbolic problems in @xcite , using adjoint solutions @xcite or estimating errors in an energy norm @xcite .",
    "the contributions have a clear focus on the rigorous derivation of error estimates and error bounds .",
    "applications are limited to one or two space dimensions .",
    "recently , solin and co - workers published papers , where they apply dynamical @xmath0-meshes for various coupled problems including electromagnetics in two space dimensions @xcite .",
    "they employ the concept of reference solutions for controlling mesh adaptivity and perform refinements , which are fully anisotropic in both mesh parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the application of reference solutions in their original form is numerically very expensive . in @xcite",
    "it is stated that the solution of large three - dimensional problems would require distributed parallel computing .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a modification of the concept of reference solutions with drastically reduced numerical costs , which makes such simulations feasible . at the same time",
    "the key advantages are maintained , in particular its robustness and the independence of a particular set of underlying partial differential equations .",
    "the increased efficiency comes at the price of losing some sharpness in the error estimate . like the original formulation ,",
    "the proposed algorithm is entirely devoid of tuning parameters , and it reduces the true approximation error , i.e. , it is not based on residuals or heuristic measures such as steep gradients .",
    "the adaptation can be performed in four major modes : isotropic in @xmath2 and @xmath1 , anisotropic in one of @xmath2 or @xmath1 , and fully anisotropic in @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "unconstrained refinement in @xmath2 is possible because we allow for high level hanging nodes .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) in a discretization will usually decrease from the former to the latter mode , while the computational load for finding the adapted mesh increases .",
    "however , we will show below that great savings in both , the number of dof and computational time can be achieved by using fully anisotropic adaptivity .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "first the individual steps , which constitute an adaptive algorithm are discussed .",
    "they are error estimation , element marking , the @xmath2@xmath1-decision and the actual mesh adaptation . for each step a brief description with a review of the state of the art",

    "we will follow the framework and notation described in our previous work  @xcite , which makes use of hexahedral meshes and modal basis functions as introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 a tessellation of the domain of interest @xmath14 composed from non - overlapping hexahedra @xmath15 such that @xmath16 covers @xmath14 .",
    "the tessellation is required to be derivable from a regular root tessellation @xmath17 by means of element bisections .",
    "however , we do not demand the resulting tessellation to be regular , i.e. , we allow for hanging nodes and specifically for high level hanging nodes .",

    "refined meshes , every face @xmath24 of a hexahedral element may be partitioned into several interfaces depending on the number of neighbors @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .",

    "we do not choose an interpolatory basis but follow a spectral approach and apply legendre polynomials scaled such that  @xcite @xmath38    associating an fes   with each element @xmath15 of the tesselation defines the finite element discretization , where the electric and magnetic field approximations @xmath39 and @xmath40 are represented as @xmath41 with the element local representations @xmath42 the time - dependent vectors of coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the numerical degrees of freedom .",
    "following the galerkin procedure and are multiplied by a test function @xmath45 and integrated over the domain @xmath14 . due to the compact support property   the integration can be carried out over every element @xmath15 individually .",
    "next , we perform integration by parts of the curl - terms and replace the exact field solution with the approximations  .",
    "this leads to the semi - discrete variational problem of finding @xmath46 and @xmath47 such that @xmath48 @xmath49 . for the above equations to be well - defined it is required that @xmath50 in the interior of @xmath51 , which is fulfilled for the chosen legendre basis .",
    "note that @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the numerical trace of the electric and magnetic field , which is single - valued for each vector field component at element boundaries .",
    "introducing the numerical trace is a necessary step for resolving the ambiguity of the numerical approximations   at element interfaces . due to the definition of the basis function support in  , the components for the vector fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 are single valued at all points @xmath56 but double - valued for all @xmath57 .",
    "the numerical trace is computed as @xmath58 typical choices are the centered and upwind value obtained by setting @xmath59 to zero or one , respectively , where the upwind value is the solution of the riemannian problem  @xcite . above @xmath60 and @xmath61",

    "is not written down explicitly .",
    "note that no assumptions on the grid regularity have been made in the derivation .",
    "this is in a sharp contrast with finite element methods based on edge elements , which require augmentation by edge constraints if hanging nodes are to be included  @xcite . in dg - type methods",
    "non - regular grids are no methodological issue , they only make the implementation more involved .",
    "the relative ease of handling non - regular meshes combined with the strictly element - local character of the numerical approximation make dg methods an ideal candidate for @xmath0-adaptivity .",

    "we will briefly list a few popular techniques and describe the main underlying idea before describing the approach followed in this contribution along with the reasoning behind this choice .",
    "error estimators or indicators can , for instance , be obtained by expressing a residual through the numerical approximation .",
    "residual based estimators in the context of maxwell s equations have been developed , e.g. , in @xcite , or in  @xcite with applications outside electrodynamics .",
    "highly accurate estimators can be constructed based on adjoint solutions  @xcite , where the latter one is applied in a dg setting",
    ". however , the accuracy of adjoint based estimators comes at the price of having to repeatedly solve for the adjoint problem in addition .",
    "comprehensive overviews of error estimation techniques are found in  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we employ the concept of reference solutions  @xcite for obtaining error estimates .",
    "a reference solution is a numerically computed approximation , which is assumed to be significantly more accurate than the present approximation .",
    "this can be achieved by performing one uniform @xmath2-refinement step combined with increasing the approximation order by one in the element under consideration .",
    "obtaining a reference mesh by pure @xmath1-enrichment has been proposed as well .",
    "both techniques provide a reference mesh based on hierarchic fes enrichment .",
    "we apply the concept in its original form for finding an initial @xmath0-mesh and propose a modified , computationally much cheaper variant , which is applied during the transient analysis .",
    "we found this estimator to be very robust and find reliable estimates independent of the local solution smoothness .",
    "this is an important advantage over the residual based estimate proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the aim then is to find the minimal @xmath0-mesh such that @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the global @xmath66-norm , and it is taken into account that the solution is a vector field . in the following @xmath67",
    "is used for denoting the electromagnetic solution @xmath68 . as only the approximation @xmath69",
    "is known but not the exact solution @xmath67 the target can not be achieved directly .",
    "however , it can be achieved asymptotically as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a projection operator from the enriched reference fes @xmath72 to a space @xmath73 associated with a refinement candidate .",
    "the space @xmath73 is reduced with respect to the reference space but enriched with respect to @xmath74 such that @xmath75 refinement can be anisotropic in one or both of the mesh parameters . from   it",
    "follows that the element - wise error estimate is given as @xmath76 given a reference solution , the global and local error estimates   and   are fully computable .      starting from the root tesselation @xmath17 with some uniform polynomial order @xmath77 a reference mesh is constructed by performing one uniform refinement step in @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we note that this has not to be done globally , but it can rather be done consecutively with each element of the current tesselation .",
    "the dg approximation @xmath78 of a given function @xmath79 on the element @xmath51 , is obtained by applying the orthogonal projection operator @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the inner product @xmath83 on the element @xmath15 . equipping the fes   with an inner product defines a hilbert space .",
    "hence , the above projector yields the best approximation in the @xmath66-sense . after projecting the initial data to the refined elements the approximation error @xmath84 of element @xmath51",
    "is estimated using  .",
    "this procedure is repeated for all elements of the current tesselation .",
    "the global error @xmath85 is obtained from  .",
    "the construction of the initial @xmath0-mesh terminates when the stopping criterion @xmath86 is met .      in the construction of an optimal initial @xmath0-mesh the reference solution at each iteration can be generated because the initial data is known exactly .",
    "obviously , this approach can not be transferred immediately to the transient analysis . in",
    "@xcite the authors approach the transient case by employing rothe s method .",
    "in contrast to the widely used method of lines , rothe s method discretizes the time variable first while preserving continuity of the spatial variable .",
    "this approach allows for applying the same techniques in the transient analysis that were used for obtaining the initial mesh at the cost of having to solve for a system of equations in every time step .    for performance reasons we prefer to employ explicit time - integration .",
    "the straightforward extension in this case is to compute on two meshes , the @xmath0-mesh fulfilling the error tolerance and its reference mesh .",
    "however , this approach can easily become prohibitively expensive , both in computing time and memory consumption as the reference mesh usually has about 15 to 60 times more dof depending on the approximation order .",
    "taking into account that , moreover , the reference solution largely exceeds the required accuracy and is employed for driving the adaptivity only , this solution does not appear to be ideal .",
    "this motivated us to seek a different approach .",
    "to this end , we switch roles of the reference mesh and the mesh used for estimating the local error and claim that the approximation on the current @xmath0-mesh is sufficiently accurate for serving as the reference solution",
    ". then , we estimate the element error by comparing to a reduced fes .",
    "this fes can be obtained by derefining the mesh in @xmath2 and @xmath1 , or in a significantly more efficient manner by reducing the approximation order @xmath87 .",
    "the element - wise error estimate is computed as @xmath88 here , the solution on the current @xmath0-mesh is the reference solution and @xmath89 is the projection operator to the @xmath1-reduced fes . computing the estimate   is very cheap .",
    "as the basis is hierarchic it comes down to considering the highest order terms of the current approximation only @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the vector of coefficients of order @xmath1 local to element @xmath51 . recalling that @xmath1 and @xmath87 are multi - indices as defined in  ,",
    "the local error estimate is computed as @xmath92 evaluating the @xmath66-norm and inserting the scaling property   yields the following form of the estimate @xmath93^{1/2}.\\ ] ] it is an important feature that the computation of this estimate is highly efficient as no runtime quadratures have to be performed .",
    "we admit that the approach of projecting the solution to a reduced fes instead of an enriched one negatively affects the accuracy of the error estimation",
    ". however , it drastically reduces computational costs rendering the method applicable for a much larger class of real world problems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] we demonstrate the robustness and reliability of this approach .      following the error estimation , each element is assigned one of the labels _ refine _ , _ derefine _ or _ retain _ according to the marking strategy .",
    "the marking strategy , hence , has a strong impact on the number of dof in the computational mesh .",
    "popular strategies include error equidistribution , the fixed fraction strategy or variable fraction strategies such as bulk - chasing , commonly known as drfler - marking .",
    "the goal of the former strategy is to equilibrate the local errors by refining or derefining elements such that @xmath94 , where @xmath84 is the local error estimate and @xmath95 is a user - defined error tolerance  @xcite .",
    "for the fixed and variable fraction strategies , the elements are ordered by their estimated error at each refinement step . then , for the former approach , a fixed fraction of elements from the top and bottom are marked for refinement and derefinement . the variable fraction or drfler - marking on the other hand continues to mark elements from the top and bottom of the list until their accumulated error accounts for a certain percentage of the total error .",
    "this can be expressed as finding a minimal subset @xmath96 and a maximal subset @xmath97 of @xmath13 such that @xmath98 , where the sign indicates refinement and derefinement .",
    "as the values of @xmath99 indicate fractions of the total error , the drfler - marking can be considered as a fixed fraction marking with respect to the total error .",
    "often a few percent of the elements make up for more than 90 % of the total error , while most of the elements contribute to the total error by less than 5 % .",
    "as the situation might change throughout a time - domain simulation , we consider the variable fraction marking the most suitable for our problems .",
    "also for the element marking distinct strategies are applied for constructing the initial @xmath0-mesh and during the transient analysis . for generating the initial @xmath0-mesh",
    ", we perform drfler - marking .",
    "the number of mesh adaptation iterations required for obtaining the initial mesh depends on the fraction of the total error .",
    "less iterations are performed for large fractions .",
    "however , this usually leads to a slightly larger number of dof .    during the transient analysis",
    "a slightly altered marking strategy is employed .",
    "this strategy is a variable fraction strategy with respect to the number of elements as well as to the total error . for every mesh adaptation a minimal subset @xmath100",
    "is assembled such that @xmath101 hence , the size of the minimal subset of elements to be refined is not larger than determined by the given fraction @xmath102 , but it can be smaller if the global error is close to the prescribed tolerance .",
    "if the estimated global error is smaller than @xmath95 , the set is empty , and no elements are refined in this adaptation step .",
    "if we were to apply the marking strategy in the same way we did for obtaining the initial mesh , the algorithm would continue refining elements even if the estimated error is less than the tolerance .",
    "as stated above , we assume that the approximation on the current @xmath0-mesh is sufficiently accurate for serving as the reference solution .",
    "this statement should ideally be true for every element .",
    "therefore , marking elements for derefinement has to be done with care .",
    "we recall that mesh adaptation during the transient analysis is a dynamic process .",
    "therefore , elements suitable for derefinement , which are not marked as such in an adaptation step are again considered for derefinement in the next step . in the examples in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] , we show that the mesh derefinement works well despite the careful approach .      following the decision on which elements to adapt , the kind of adaptation has to be chosen , i.e. , @xmath2- or @xmath1-adaptation .",
    "this decision is guided by the local solution smoothness .",
    "it is well known that for sufficiently smooth solutions consecutive @xmath1-enrichment leads to exponential convergence , whereas @xmath2-refinement yields algebraic convergence rates only  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaussrect ] illustrates the dependence of the convergence rate on the regularity .",
    "the waveforms depicted in the insets , i.e. , a gaussian and a trapezoidal waveform in one - dimensional space , are projected to spaces @xmath103 with @xmath87 varying from zero to five .",
    "the plots show the global error measured in the @xmath66-norm . while the convergence rate increases from one to six with every increase of @xmath87 for the gaussian waveform , convergence is limited to first order in the latter case .     for the gaussian waveform .",
    "in the right panel , the low regularity limits convergence to first order . ]",
    "( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( -388,52 ) ( -193,50 ) ( -90,2 ) ( -285,2 )    however , exponential convergence in terms of dof can be obtained even for locally non - smooth solutions as well by employing proper @xmath0-refinement  @xcite . to this end",
    ", regions of low regularity are embedded into @xmath2-refined areas of the mesh using low order polynomials .",
    "then , @xmath1-refinement is applied everywhere else .",
    "thus , the performance of the adaptive method critically hinges on correct @xmath0-decisions . in order to be in the position of performing anisotropic @xmath0-refinement in three - dimensional space , we require information about the directional smoothness of the unknown solution .",
    "a variety of techniques have been proposed for assessing the local smoothness or , more general , for making the @xmath0-decision .",
    "the simplest ones makes use of information that is available _ a priori _ such as the position of field singularities due to edges and corners  @xcite .",
    "however , instead of relying on geometric information , we rather wish to drive the @xmath0-decision based on the actual numerical solution .",
    "known methods include the type parameter technique  @xcite , texas 3-step  @xcite , mesh optimization techniques  @xcite , error prediction  @xcite or local regularity estimations  @xcite .",
    "descriptions of all methods are beyond the scope of this paper , and we refer to  @xcite for an extended overview including descriptions .",
    "a particularly popular method is the estimation of the sobolev regularity index @xmath104 in a local manner .",
    "one such technique is described briefly in the following , as it is illustrative for understanding why we pursue a different strategy .",
    "we focus on  @xcite , where the authors develop such a strategy based on monitoring the decay rate of the sequence of coefficients in the legendre series expansion of the numerical solution .",
    "the drawback of this method and similar ones is that a certain number of coefficients is required for the computation of the coefficient decay rate to be robust . taking into account that the legendre coefficient of order zero provides information about the average in the element only , coefficients providing actual decay information start with the order of one .",
    "hence , decay rate estimations require second order approximations as a minimum although higher order approximations will make the method more robust .",
    "problems also occur if the solution exhibits a pronounced odd - even characteristic  @xcite leading to an alternation of small and large valued coefficients .",
    "the extension to problems in two- and three - dimensional space is possible but not unique , and the technique loses part of its clarity . as approximation orders of at least two have to be applied in all directions , this leads to a significant number of dof also in elements , which do not require it .    as we wish to employ approximation orders as low as possible everywhere the solution permits , we follow a different approach . to this end",
    ", we reuse the reference solution at hand for finding the most suitable refinement from a list of candidates .",
    "this approach circumvents the issue of regularity estimation and the associated difficulties by testing various @xmath2- , @xmath1- and @xmath0-candidates with respect to the reference solution . with this strategy ,",
    "the best candidate naturally arises as the one offering the best ratio of approximation error @xmath105 to the logarithm of its number of dof ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the size of the list of candidates can vary considerably .",
    "it depends on the global refinement strategy , i.e. isotropic refinement only , fully anisotropic , or anisotropic in one of @xmath2 and @xmath1 only , but it also depends on the permissible increment and decrement in the @xmath2-refinement level @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in this paper , we restrict both to one .",
    "however , candidates have to be competitive .",
    "this means that increasing the @xmath2-refinement level @xmath109 , or @xmath110 in the anisotropic case , goes along with a reduction of @xmath87 in order to prevent a strong increase of the number of dof in the element .",
    "the approximation order is reduced such that the number of dof of the candidate is as small as possible but larger than the one of the current element ( @xmath111 ) . if isotropic refinement is applied two refinement candidates are obtained , one @xmath2-candidate , consisting of eight elements with possibly decreased approximation order @xmath87 , and one @xmath1-candidate .",
    "for fully anisotropic refinement a number of fourteen candidates is considered , which are obtained by refining each of the mesh parameters @xmath2 or @xmath1 in one direction ( three candidates ) , two directions ( three candidates ) , and all three directions ( one candidate ) .",
    "the approximation order @xmath87 of @xmath2-candidates is reduced as described above .",
    "the procedure above applies to mesh refinement . for the case of mesh derefinement",
    ", it is natural to proceed in a similar manner and set up derefinement candidates with a smaller number of dof .    in the dynamic case ,",
    "the procedure requires modification as the problem is encountered that a refined reference solution can not be constructed .",
    "an error estimate is obtained by projecting to a @xmath1-reduced fes , however , given our description of regularity estimation based on coefficient decay rates , it is doubtful that regularity information can be extracted from a comparison of two solutions of the order @xmath87 and @xmath112 in a robust way . as there is not enough information available for making a reasoned @xmath0-decision , the respective element is refined uniformly in @xmath2 and @xmath1 . during the next mesh adaptation one or more of the refined elements",
    "might be derefined again according to the estimated error .",
    "hence , it is during mesh derefinement only that anisotropic adaptation occurs .      at this point",
    "sufficient information is available for performing error driven @xmath0-adaptation , which can be anisotropic in both mesh parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 . upon mesh adaptation",
    "the numerical approximation given on the current @xmath0-mesh @xmath113 has to be transferred to the adapted mesh @xmath114 .",
    "the objective is to find the best representation of @xmath69 on @xmath114 with respect to the @xmath66-norm .",
    "for all adaptations ( @xmath2/@xmath1 refine / derefine ) this is achieved by applying the orthogonal projection operator @xmath80 introduced in  . due to the compact support of the basis",
    ", an unconstrained projection can be carried out in a strictly element - wise fashion .",
    "additionally , the tensor product property of the basis   allows for performing the projection along each dimension individually .",
    "this reduces the three - dimensional quadrature of complexity order three in the number of quadrature nodes to a product of three one - dimensional quadratures of complexity order one . for the details of the projection we refer to @xcite , where the issues of optimality , stability and efficiency are investigated in details .      during one time - domain simulation a very large number of adaptations is performed .",
    "these have to be administered in a way , which allows for an efficient traversing of all elements in each time step .",
    "additionally , parent - child information is required for simplifying mesh derefinement . in this context ,",
    "tree structures emerge as a suitable storage format .",
    "they allow for operating on the current discretization by working on the tree leaves only but contain the refinement history and parental relationships as well .    in the case of isotropic @xmath2-refinement",
    ", the tree is organized using octree - structures , where each of the eight children is assigned to one branch . in an octree - structure ,",
    "every element and its associated node is either a non - reducible element of the root tesselation @xmath17 or one of eight children of a single parent element .",

    "nevertheless , in more complex situations in three - dimensional space it is a clear disadvantage if mesh refinement and derefinement have to be performed in reversed order .",

    "[ fig : mintree ] . nevertheless , for general refinements in three dimensions trees of a significantly smaller depth are obtained .",
