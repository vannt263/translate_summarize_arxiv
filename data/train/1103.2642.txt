    "the role of neutrino muon and tau mixing among flavors has been observed since nearly 13 years and it has been foreseen already in different recent high energy astrophysical roles @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . recently minos results hint for a cpt violation in neutrino sector .",
    "we considered therefore a long base experiment to deep core to disentangle such a neutrino cpt puzzle . the suggested beaming ( opera like experiment ) of neutrinos from cern ( or fnl ) across the earth to icecube might provide a novel signature for muon and anti - muon neutrino mixing while better focusing flavor parameters @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the present atmospheric neutrino noise that should arise in deep core data is also bearing important records on neutrino mixing and eventual cpt violation .",
    "indeed we used previous ( deep core ) expected rate to foresee ( over the same expected spectra ) deviation due to cpt ( minos like ) violations .",
    "nevertheless a more accurate study did lead us to foresee a different spectra @xcite , to be elaborated here , more in detail , based on the known super - kamiokande detection , scaled to deep core volumes ( and environment ) .",
    "earlier @xcite preliminary result is here more deepened and confirmed , starting from primordial atmospheric spectra , source of atmospheric neutrinos up to their interactions and muon event rate whose tracks are projected along each channel string .",
    "results are somehow surprising respect earlier ones .",
    "let us remind the neutrino energy flux defined as @xmath1    that we parameterized , here for the first time , fitting the well known curve from refs.@xcite for muon neutrinos with the following analytical formula :    @xmath2    where the energy @xmath3 is expressed in gev unity ; the energy range of this formula embrace the hundred mev up to tev .",
    "this averaged isotropic spectra must be enhanced ( empirically ) at horizons ( slightly at low , gevs energy and more at high tev energy ) because of longer pion , kaons and muons decay flight .",
    "we disregarded for deep core and icecube at south pole the geomagnetic cut off influence ; ( its role at lowest energy has been taken into account at superkamiokande for azimuthal directions ) . to take into account of the enhancement ( of horizontal respect to vertical rate ) we derived ( to fit the sk data ) a correction factor to be multiplied to previous flux :    @xmath4^{-1},\\ ] ]    where the energy is in gev unity , and horizontal angle @xmath5 ( complemental to zenith angle @xmath6 ) range from @xmath7 ( horizon ) to @xmath8 ( upward vertical direction ) .",
    "the total mass target in deep core for incoming neutrino is taken from the effective volume estimated ( for each energy ) in @xcite , without online veto .",
    "the ratio between all ( fully contained ( fc ) with partially contained ( pc ) and upward stopping and through going , i.e. without on line veto ) events versus only ( fc+pc , i.e. on - line veto ) is unity up to @xmath9 gev , reaching a ratio @xmath10 at @xmath11 gev , or @xmath12 at tev . in these highest energies",
    "the channel rate is low and it is not so relevant in our neutrino oscillation study , mostly focused below @xmath13 gev and below maximal 50 channels .",
    "therefore we considered here all the events without veto , almost coincident with the ones with veto within 50 channels count , within the following deep core energy dependent ( as expected following @xcite in gev energy unity ) , threshold volume :    @xmath14\\;\\textrm{m}^3 . \\label{v}\\ ] ]    neutrino charge current ( cc ) cross section for muon production is considered ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) to be linear increasing with energy , in the energy range considered , while antineutrino cross section is taken about a half of the neutrino one .",
    "electron neutrino and tau neutrinos cc and all flavor neutral current ( nc ) event are source of spherical showers whose role may influence ( and pollute ) only a few channel ( 3 - 5 ) and are only mentioned here : they will be discussed in detail elsewhere .",
    "the calculation includes neutrino oscillation probability as a function both of energy and arrival observation angle , given the earth chord distance for each angle below the horizon , @xmath15 ; it means that we take into account three exact neutrino flavor oscillation ( see @xcite ) , discussing the out - coming ( observable ) muon tracks .",
    "we took into account also the matter influence on the mixing inside the earth assuming at each zenith angle the corresponding average earth density .",
    "we will show elsewhere that the exact integral in variable earth density do not change our present results at @xmath16@xmath17 gev ranges , but mostly induce changes at lower energies .",
    "we obtain thus the differential event number ( per unit energy and solid angle and unit time ) in function of neutrino energy and the horizontal angle @xmath5 , in our definition starting from @xmath18 at horizon , equal to @xmath19 at vertical upward direction :    @xmath20     as above the differential number event count a year in deep core as a function of the muon neutrino energy and angle , observable in wide scale ( top , @xmath21@xmath22 gev ) assuming an average earth density @xmath23 during up - going neutrino flight within earth.the horizontal axis is the energy in gev , the vertical one is the event rate a year in deep core , the depth axis is the zenith angle variable in radiant .",

    "[ projected ] .",
    "the muon born in charged current interaction has nearly half the neutrino energy , and undergoes an average energy loss of @xmath36 mev m@xmath37 or @xmath38 gev m@xmath37 .",
    "therefore the muon length ( keeping in mind that kinematically holds @xmath39 ) in water is approximately : @xmath40 m , with energy as usual expressed in gev .",
    "we used indeed the exact linear - logarithmic growth in water : @xmath41 to obtain a comparable plot of events distribution versus channel number we assumed an average projection factor , @xmath42 of muon track along the dom strings due to the spread of the muon track direction ( in range @xmath43 ) first to be @xmath44 at same plane ; however an additional projection factor @xmath44 is needed because muons tracks may be often skew respect the string line .",
    "the overall factor ranges ( in average between @xmath45 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "we assumed the medium projection factor equal to @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 each channel to channel distance corresponds no longer to @xmath48 gev ( as for a vertical muon ) but because of the inclined muon track projected along the vertical string @xmath49 , on average , to a wider energy band of @xmath50 gev .",
    "this projecting factor smear the sharp decay on rate event due to the oscillation and it mask most of the low energy neutrino oscillation , whose inner traces has been revealed by sk only in last decade .",
    "however the most severe deepening in the spectra ( see our result versus earlier one in fig .",
    "[ projected ] ) at about @xmath24 gev survive the smearing and it marks our expected count rate .     as previous figure , where neutrino mixing occurs in matter .",

    "the deep core telescope rate should be soon published : their spectra ( projected and counted along the channel ) might be foreseen now and compared soon with the records . even if we did first used the deep core predictions @xcite , in late papers @xcite we did wonder and did suggest a different expected rate . in the present paper",
    "we show step by step the procedure to foresee the deep core rate based on known cosmic ray rate and on sk muon neutrino flux , flux interacting in deep core ( variable ) volume , leading , after mixing ( see appendix ) to survived muon ( and anti - muons ) neutrinos whose lepton tracks may rise in deep core optical module string .",
    "our results differ from other ones @xcite , see fig [ confronto ] ; we tried to verify the estimates in different check ( versus other experiments ) and we believe that they are ( at first approximation ) correct .",
    "the deep core rate shape , its intensity might be soon verified and tested .",
    "if the expected ( cpt conserved estimate ) are met , minos claim might be rejected .",
    "if at some channels ( mostly 3 - 4 - 5 ) there will be an over production of signals , than the minos cpt violated hint may be taken seriously .",
    "it should be taken into account that nc ( neutral current ) events at tens gev may spread light in spherical shape increasing and polluting the ( 3 - 6 ) channel rate ; these a few thousands ( @xmath52 ) events may enrich channel 2 - 5 ; however their timing structure and their uneven light intensity ratio may probe their different nature ( see @xcite ) from the up - going vertical muon ones , possibly to be separated easily .",
    "therefore these new deep core records may probe at minimum channel gate ( 6 - 8 ) an atmospheric suppression offering a rare windows for 20 gevs neutrino astronomy . to observe such an astronomy in the whole arrival direction ( not just along the zenith but also in its azimuth ) we suggest the doubling of the present deep core array strings , allowing a contemporaneous double string detection .",
    "the discovery of twenty gev neutrino astronomy in deep core may find a bonus also in rare , but nearby and powerful , solar flare neutrino brightening @xcite",
    "the evolution equation for three neutrino mixing in matter reads : @xmath53    which is a schrodinger equation with a matter potential @xmath54 ,    @xmath55    where  @xmath56 is the potential only due to @xmath57 charged current interaction .",
    "this equation is a set of 9 differential equations whose solutions for probability conversion @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , has boundaries conditions @xmath60 equal to 1 for the starting flavor @xmath61 , 0 for the others ( electron conversion into muon is negligible ) .",
    "this system of equations is symmetric since @xmath62 .    among the simplest numerical solutions to show",
    ", we found a compact survival probability , for instance in vacuum for muon to muon , at a distance equal to the earth diameter , corresponding to @xmath63 , as a function of neutrino energy : + @xmath64    the more general cases taken into our study , with earth matter density included , are expression too wide and too complex ( few pages of mathematica program ) to be written here .",
