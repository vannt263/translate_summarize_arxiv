    "the inclusive semileptonic @xmath0 meson decay branching fraction @xmath7 is a fundamental quantity that is required to fully understand @xmath0 meson decays .",
    "the decay is believed to be dominated by a spectator process , where the @xmath8 quark is coupled to a @xmath5 or @xmath9 quark and a virtual @xmath10 boson , while the accompanying quark in the meson , the so - called spectator , plays no direct role .",
    "therefore , the theoretical treatment is relatively simple , and the semileptonic width @xmath11 can be readily predicted .",
    "however , it has long been a puzzle that while theoretical calculations predict values of @xmath7 higher than 12%  @xcite , most measurements have been consistently lower , at 1011%  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy may be attributed to the uncertainty in predicting the hadronic decay width @xmath12 , where contributions from non - spectator processes are significant .",
    "the non - spectator contribution depends on the flavor of the accompanying quark , while this is not the case for @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , it may result in unequal @xmath7 values for neutral and charged @xmath0 mesons , hereafter referred to as @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 is equal to the @xmath0 lifetime ratio @xmath16 assuming equality in @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath0 lifetime ratio is measured well  @xcite . however",
    ", only a few measurements have addressed @xmath17 and @xmath18 separately , and the uncertainties have been large due to low efficiencies for tagging neutral and charged events  @xcite .",
    "the deviations from unity for both the lifetime ratio and the @xmath19 ratio are predicted to be of order 10%  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , measurement of @xmath20 combined with the lifetime is one of the favored methods to determine the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "heavy - quark - expansions ( hqes )  @xcite have become a useful tool to calculate the correction due to strong interaction effects .",
    "there have been some attempts to improve the determination of @xmath21 , by fitting the perturbative and non - perturbative parameters in hqes to the data of the hadronic invariant mass ( @xmath22 ) and the lepton energy ( @xmath23 ) moments in the @xmath0 semileptonic decay  @xcite .",
    "recently , the babar collaboration performed a fit to the partial @xmath24 branching fraction and the @xmath22 and @xmath23 moments , with varied cutoffs on the lepton energy , to extract @xmath21 and the total @xmath24 branching fraction as well as the hqe parameters  @xcite on a consistent basis .    in this paper",
    "we report measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the electronic channel with an electron momentum requirement @xmath25gev/@xmath5 , as measured in the rest frame of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "these measurements are based on data collected by the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric @xmath26 collider  @xcite , which provides copious production of @xmath27 meson pairs on the @xmath28 resonance . in this analysis ,",
    "one @xmath0 meson is fully reconstructed in one of several hadronic decay modes to determine its charge , flavor , and momentum , and is referred to as the tag side @xmath0 ( @xmath29 ) in the event .",
    "the semileptonic decay of the other @xmath0 meson , referred to as the spectrum side @xmath0 ( @xmath30 ) , is then measured in its rest frame , determined from @xmath29 , without smearing due to the @xmath0 motion .",
    "prompt semileptonic decays ( @xmath31 ) can be separated from secondary decays ( @xmath32 ) , based on the correlation between the @xmath29 flavor and the electron charge . to exploit the advantages of this method",
    "requires a large sample of @xmath27 events because the full reconstruction efficiency is rather low , typically of the order of 0.1% .",
    "our high integrated luminosity enables us to perform this measurement with higher accuracy than previously achieved .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on a 140 fb@xmath33 data sample accumulated on the @xmath28 resonance , which contains @xmath34 pairs .",
    "the center - of - mass energy is @xmath35gev .",
    "an additional 15 fb@xmath1 data sample taken at a center - of - mass energy 60mev below the @xmath28 resonance is used to evaluate background from the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) process .",
    "a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , which fully describes the detector geometry and response and is based on geant  @xcite , is applied to study backgrounds in the @xmath29 reconstruction , backgrounds in the signal electron detection , and corrections to the signal selection efficiency due to the tagging . in the mc simulation , generic @xmath27 decays are simulated using the qq98 generator  @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a three - layer silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
