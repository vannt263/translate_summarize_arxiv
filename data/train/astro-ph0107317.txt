    "the centaur ( 2060 ) chiron has been the target of extensive study , particularly since 1989 when its cometary activity was first detected @xcite .",
    "ground - based surface photometry revealed a dust coma extending out to @xmath2 km from the nucleus @xcite , while the inner coma was probed by means of stellar occultations @xcite and using hst @xcite .",
    "water ice has been recently detected in chiron @xcite , and its cometary activity is supposed to be powered by the release of trapped @xmath3 within the @xmath4 ice matrix @xcite .",
    "photometric observations have revealed , in addition to the rotational lightcurve , brightness variations with time - scales of days , weeks , and years which are ascribed to changing activity .",
    "however , it remains to be explained why chiron s brightness decreased while approaching perihelion , and why the presence of a prominent coma is not always coincident with brightness maxima ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "hence , a continuous monitoring of this object , especially near perihelion , has often been encouraged .",
    "considered as a nearby representative of kuiper belt objects , investigation of chiron , and centaurs in general , is ideal for getting a closer look at the frozen bodies of the outer solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we present broad - band ccd imaging of chiron during a post - perihelion period ( 19961998 ) when published optical photometry is rather scarce . the observations are described in section [ s_obs ] , while section [ s_rd ] presents the results of our aperture and surface photometry .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ s_conc ] .",
    "we obtained broad  band @xmath5 ( johnson ) and @xmath6 ( cousins ) ccd imaging of 2060 chiron on 5 nights during three different observing runs with the `` jorge sahade '' 2.15 m telescope of casleo ( san juan , argentina ) .",
    "the detector was a cryogenically cooled tek 1024 ccd , with a gain of 1.98 electrons adu@xmath7 and a read - out noise of 9.8 electrons .",
    "a focal reducer provided a field of view approximately 9 arcmin in diameter , with a scale of 0.82 arcsec pix@xmath8 .",
    "the telescope was tracked at sidereal rate , hence exposure times of individual frames were limited to a maximum of 180 sec in order to avoid smearing of the images because of chiron s proper motion ( @xmath9 arcsec min@xmath7 ) .",
    "the observations span a time interval of 16 months ; the dates , ut at mid - exposure , and individual exposure times at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , are given in the first four columns of table  [ t_aph ] .",
    "weather conditions varied along the nights , with very good atmosphere transparency during the 1997 run , but with thin cirrus during the two other runs , while seeing fwhm was never better than @xmath10 arcsec .",
    "several standard stars fields from @xcite were also observed each night for calibrating the photometry to the standard system .",
    "data reduction was made following normal procedures with the iraf software package .",
    "all frames were debiased and flat - fielded using high signal  to  noise dome flats .",
    "aperture photometry of chiron and the standard stars was performed on every individual image with the apphot package within iraf , using an aperture radius of 10 pix ( 8.2 arcsec ) .",
    "given the relatively high galactic latitude of chiron during the observations ( @xmath11 ) , there were no severe crowding problems in our images .",
    "table [ t_aph ] also gives the apparent @xmath5 magnitude and @xmath12 colour , along with their respective photometric errors , for each observation .",
    "the corresponding heliocentric ( @xmath13 ) and geocentric ( @xmath14 ) distances and phase angles ( @xmath15 ) were taken from the ephemeris , and were used to calculate the absolute ( @xmath16 ) magnitudes , following @xcite , and adopting a slope parameter @xmath17 @xcite to correct the magnitudes to phase angle @xmath18 . however , the presence of some degree of cometary activity ( see sect .  [ s_surfphot ] ) probably invalidates the use of such @xmath19 value @xcite , hence reduced ( @xmath20 , i.e. , without any phase correction ) magnitudes are also listed .",
    "apparent magnitudes and astrometry obtained from the same observations have been reported by @xcite .    during our 1997 and 1998 observations chiron was very close to its historical minima ( @xmath21 mag ) of 1983 - 85 and 1995 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , while in late 1996 it appeared slightly brighter , although the rather large error bar in this case prevents any reliable comparison .",
    "mean absolute @xmath5 magnitudes were @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the 1997 and 1998 runs , respectively .",
    "the 1998 observations were done under non - photometric conditions , hence they had to be tied to a previous night with better weather through 6 stars within the ccd field that were observed both nights .",
    "although a systematic error may thus still be present in the absolute photometry , a differential @xmath5 lightcurve for chiron against a comparison field star ( @xmath24 ) clearly shows a @xmath25 mag dimming in about one hour , as displayed in figure  [ f_mdif98 ] .",
    "differential magnitudes ( @xmath26 ) of a second control field star ( @xmath27 ) against @xmath24 , also shown , give a stability check . after correcting for light - time effect and adopting a synodic period of 5.917813  hs @xcite ,",
    "this brightness decrease is consistent with chiron s rotational lightcurve @xcite although the peak - to - peak amplitude seems to be larger than most published values ( @xmath28 mag ) .",
    "our result matches the amplitude observed by @xcite during the 1986 brightness minimum , when no coma was directly observed and , hence , a small dilution was expected .",
    "note that , if the brightness variation we report here is purely rotational , we can only set a lower limit to its amplitude since a clear minimum was not detected .",
    "the corresponding @xmath12 colours in table  [ t_aph ] get slightly bluer with time ; however , this bluing is only apparent , being caused by the fact that the @xmath6 frames were taken a few minutes after the corresponding @xmath5 frames , and hence chiron was then dimmer .",
    "correction of this effect ( by interpolating the @xmath6 magnitudes at the same instants of observation as the @xmath5 ones ) gives a fairly constant colour , with a mean @xmath29 .",
    "this achromatic behaviour supports rotation of an asymmetric object as the origin of the light variation , against the effect of dark ( and red ) spots on the body s surface .    following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their eq .",
    "19 ) , a bare nucleus magnitude @xmath30 can be estimated from the relation between observed light - curve amplitude ( @xmath31 ) and mean absolute magnitude .",
    "our data ( @xmath32 mag , @xmath33 ) are best fitted with a relatively faint nuclear magnitude @xmath1 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a bare nucleus amplitude @xmath34 mag",
    ". however , lazzaro et al.s ( 1997 ) data are consistent with a much lower @xmath35 .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that the 1998 dimming was part of a larger , non - rotational brightness variation .",
    "the 1997 data , obtained under photometric conditions , also show a @xmath36 mag dimming from the first to second nights , although in this case the time sampling is insufficient for trying a match with the rotational light - curve .",
    "azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles ( sbps ) of chiron and two comparison stars within the same ccd frame were obtained with the ellipse task within iraf - stsdas from our deepest images , those obtained on 1997 , june 27 , and 1998 , april 28 .",
    "several ( 27 ) frames per band corresponding to each night were summed up in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "background objects were masked - out and a clipping routine was used to eliminate remaining faint objects and bad pixels .",
    "comparison stars with magnitudes as close as possible to that of chiron , and lying within no more than @xmath37 arcmin of projected distance from it , were always selected .",
    "the images obtained on apr 28 , 1998 span a considerable range in time ( @xmath38 hour ) , hence two different composite frames were generated for each band : one using the centroids of several field stars for registering the frames before summing them up , and the other using the centroids of chiron s images .",
    "this procedure thus resulted in two sets of images , one with sidereal tracking , from which the comparison stars sbps were obtained , and the other set as if `` coarsely tracked '' on chiron , with 840 and 700 sec total exposure times in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "grey level reproductions of the central @xmath39 arcmin of the chiron  tracked , sky - subtracted images are shown in figure  [ f_grisvyr ] .",
    "north is up and east to the left , with the anti - solar direction at position angle @xmath40 . a faint coma extending at least @xmath41 arcsec ( @xmath42 km projected distance ) from the centre of chiron s image is visible in that direction .",
    "note that chiron s orbital motion was directed at position angle @xmath43 , as can be seen from the star trails .",
    "contour plots ( of @xmath44 arcmin sub - images ) are also shown in figure  [ f_contvyr ] , with the faintest contours displayed corresponding to @xmath45 mag arcsec@xmath8 and @xmath46 mag arcsec@xmath8 , respectively , and a 1 mag arcsec@xmath8 contour spacing .",
    "chiron s coma is also evident from the high signal - to - noise sbps as a surface brightness enhancement above the stellar psf for distances to the nucleus @xmath47 ( figure  [ f_sbps ] ) ; however , it is only marginally detected in the images with shorter effective exposure times obtained in 1996 and 1997 jun 25 - 26 . in every case ,",
    "the fluxes of the two comparison stars within an 8 arcsec radius aperture were scaled to match that of chiron .",
    "special care was taken for sky determination and subtraction , since low surface brightness features are very sensitive to small errors in the adopted sky level .",
    "first , a plane was fitted to the sky background of each image and this fit was subtracted .",
    "then , the sbps were computed , and a final fine - tuning of the local sky level for each object ( typically a few adu ) was made by plotting the total flux vs.  radius , and checking that the total flux attained a constant value for sufficiently large radii ( @xmath38 arcmin ) . finally , the sbps were re - computed after correcting for the residual sky .",
    "a power - law @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the surface brightness in intensity units and @xmath50 is the radial distance from the nucleus in arcsec , was fitted to the 1998 sbps , after subtraction of scaled mean stellar profiles .",
    "the fits were made in the log  log plane , with the fitting range set to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , avoiding the seeing - smeared central regions as well as the noisy outer regions .",
    "the slopes thus obtained were @xmath53 and @xmath54 , for @xmath6 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "these values are roughly consistent with a dust coma were radiation pressure effects are important ( @xmath55 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , still allowing for the respective errors , the slope of the sbp is steeper in @xmath6 than in @xmath5 , corresponding to a change in colour from @xmath56 at @xmath57 to @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "due to poorer seeing conditions , no reliable slope values could be obtained from the 1997 data ; however , a qualitatively similar gradient is evident beyond the seeing disk and out to @xmath60 ( @xmath61 km ) in a @xmath62 vs.  @xmath50 plot .",
    "this blue gradient could be tentatively explained as a scattering effect due to a smaller mean grain size at larger distances from the nucleus . since the ratio of solar radiation pressure to solar gravity on the grain ( @xmath63 ) is inversely proportional to the grain radius @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 kg m@xmath8",
    ", @xmath67 is the radiation pressure scattering efficiency , and @xmath68 is the grain density @xcite , smaller grains should be more efficiently accelerated by radiation pressure thus traveling farther from the nucleus than larger grains .    curiously , this outwards bluing of chiron s coma is opposite to the gradient observed by @xcite in 1990 . since unnoticed systematic errors",
    "may be affecting our photometry at very faint surface brightness levels , independent confirmation would be desirable .",
    "our post - perihelion observations ( @xmath69 au ) show that during 1997 and 1998 chiron was still at a brightness minimum , however , a coma was clearly detected .",
    "this coma can be traced out to a projected distance @xmath42 km in the anti - solar direction , and down to a surface brightness @xmath45 mag arcsec@xmath8 , i.e , at least as faint as the deepest observations of chiron published to date @xcite .",
    "the slopes of the sbps of this feature are consistent with a dust coma affected by radiation pressure . on the other hand , a significant ( at a @xmath70 level )",
    "gradient is detected , with @xmath12 colours getting bluer outwards , both for 1997 and 1998 data .",
    "a grain population with mean size decreasing with distance from the nucleus could be invoked to explain the observed gradient , although , in the light of opposite results @xcite , our conclusion should be taken with care and confronted with new observations .",
    "our aperture differential photometry , during the night with best time coverage , shows that chiron s brightness dimmed by @xmath0 mag in roughly 1 hr without significantly changing its colour .",
    "if this dimming is totally due to rotational effects ( and not part of a larger , non - asteroidal brightness change that our observations failed to completely sample ) , the nuclear magnitude can be estimated at @xmath71 ( @xmath5 band ) , with a bare nucleus light - curve amplitude @xmath72 mag .",
