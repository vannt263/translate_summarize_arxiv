    "the optical and ultraviolet spectra of agns and quasars have been understood profoundly since their discovery .",
    "accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) located in galactic centres is powering the giant emissions of agns and quasars through release of gravitational energy of the infalling gas @xcite .",
    "it is well understood that the broad emission lines arise from gas photoionized by accretion disks of smbhs ( @xcite ) . according to the hypothesis of supermassive black hole binaries ( smbhbs ; @xcite )",
    ", there should be some agns and quasars powered by them at least ( @xcite ) , manifesting with double - peaked or asymmetric emission lines ( @xcite ) and long - term periodic variations ( @xcite ) . although there are indeed growing indirect evidence for smbhbs ( e.g. , @xcite based on special characteristic of spectral energy distributions , or @xcite on features of tidal disruption event in galactic centres ) , identification of them , in particular in sub - parsec scale , is still challenging .",
    "since long - term monitoring campaigns are extremely time - consuming , only a few agns and quasars , such as oj 287 ( @xcite ) , pg 1302 - 102 ( @xcite ) and pso j334.2028 + 01.4075 @xcite , have been found to exhibit long - term periodic ( or quasi ) variations of a few to @xmath3 years in optical and ultraviolet continuum .",
    "a major advance was made recently by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g15b ) , who performed a systematic search for the long - term periodical variations of continuum in quasars covered by the crts and finally identified more than one hundred of candidates .",
    "periodic variability is generally believed to be a common signature of smbhbs , but there also exist alternative explanations ( @xcite ; g15b ) .",
    "the crts sample offers an opportunity to test the periodicity and probe the properties of smbhbs . in this paper , we extend the g15b study to show more statistics of the long - term periodicity . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume a standard @xmath4cdm cosmology with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the crts sample consists of 111 quasars with unambiguous observed periods from a few to @xmath8 years , as listed in table  [ tab:1 ] of g15b .",
    "we cross - checked the sample with sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data and found available spectra for 90 quasars .",
    "data reduction of the sdss spectra followed the procedures described in @xcite .",
    "we measured the 5100   luminosity and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the broad h@xmath9 and lines .",
    "we used a relation of @xmath10 to convert the ultraviolet continuum into 5100   ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used the well - established relation between blr size and agn 5100   luminosity ( @xmath11 relation ; @xcite ) to estimate the blr size @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the luminosity at 5100 .",
    "we followed the standard way of estimating bh mass , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant , @xmath16  lt - d , @xmath17 is the fwhm velocity , and @xmath18 is a constant which includes all the unknown information about the geometry and kinematics of the blr .",
    "the factor @xmath18 is obtained by calibrating equation  ( 2 ) against smbh mass obtained from the well known @xmath19 relationship in local bulge galaxies .",
    "we took @xmath20 in this paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that equation  ( 2 ) only applies to local quasars with h@xmath9 emission line ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "for high@xmath22 quasars , we used the extended relation of equation ( 2 ) using  emission line ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then use the obtained black hole mass to calculate the parameters of accretion disks and extensively explore if the observed long - term periods are related to accretion disks ( see  3 below ) .        [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab:1 ]    in table  [ tab:1 ] , we list the main properties of the sample .",
    "g15b determined the observed periods of the sample by the wwz@xmath23acf method , which gives a typical uncertainty of 10 percent for the periods .",
    "for the uncertainties of black hole mass estimate , we included the intrinsic scatters of 0.4  dex ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the uncertainties of 5100   luminosity @xmath24 , we digitized the light curves from g15b ( see their figure 7 ) and included the standard deviation of light curves .",
    "figures  [ fig : pad](_e , f , g , h _ ) plot the distributions of the observed periods , 5100   luminosities , black hole mass and accretion rates ( see  3 for a definition ) .",
    "the current sample shows that 1 ) the period peaks at @xmath25800 days ; 2 ) the luminosity cover from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ; 3 ) the black hole mass at @xmath28 , but extends to @xmath29 ; and 4 ) the accretion rate spans from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "the moderate accretion rates indicate that the objects of the sample are in the regime of standard accretion disk model , which is described by @xcite .",
    "as for the accretion disks , we study four characteristic radii and explore if they can account for the long - term periodicity . in the standard accretion disk model , the effective temperature as a function of disk radius",
    "is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the stefan - boltzman constant , @xmath34 , @xmath35  cm is the gravitational radius , @xmath36 is the dimensionless accretion rate , and @xmath37 is the eddington luminosity . here",
    "we neglect the inner boundary condition .",
    "the emergent spectra of accretion disks are given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the inner radius of the disk and @xmath40 is the planck function .",
    "this yields the well - known canonic spectra as @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to show that the accretion rate can be expressed by 5100   luminosity and black hole mass",
    "@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the cosine of the inclination angle of the disk .",
    "we take @xmath44 , which corresponds to the opening angle of the dusty torus .",
    "figure  [ fig : pad ] show the relation between the rest - frame periods with the 5100   luminosities , black hole mass and accretion rates , respectively ; apparent correlations can be seen .",
    "however , we note that the sample selection is based on both the magnitude limit and the time span of the monitoring ( @xmath47 years ) . since the redshift distribution of the sample spans a wide range of @xmath48 , the relations of the rest - frame periods with agn parameters will be significantly distorted by the redshift effect . specifically , high-@xmath49 quasars have higher luminosities but smaller rest - frame periods , leading to spurious correlations .",
    "we employ partial correlation analysis ( see the appendix ) to quantitatively test if the correlations are caused by the redshift effect .",
    "the spearman rank - order coefficients of the correlation between @xmath50 and ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) are @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the coefficients of the correlation between ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) and redshift are @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the partial correlation coefficients between @xmath56 and ( @xmath51 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) are @xmath59 with null probabilities of @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the low values of the partial correlation coefficients confirm that the apparent correlations are spurious .",
    "there are no significant correlation between the rest - frame period and optical luminosity , black hole mass and accretion rate .",
    "if the periodicity arises from accretion disks of single black holes , the observed variability period and our correlation analysis provide useful restraints on variablitiy models in accretion disks .",
    "for example , @xcite propsoed a theoretical model based on disk thermal instability and predicted that the continuum variations of agn obey a relation of @xmath61 , and the timescale @xmath62 years for the high - luminosity agns , which is much longer than the observed periods of g15b sample .",
    "on the other hand , under the smbhb hypothesis , one may expect that the orbital period would depend on the total black hole mass of the system . however , partial correlation analysis shown that there is no correlation between the period ( @xmath63 in rest - frame ) and measured black hole mass .",
    "the intrinsic scatter of black hole mass estimated from the @xmath64 relation is as large as 0.43  dex ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , the possible biases between measured black hole mass and `` true '' mass may lead to additional scatters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is plausible that the intrinsic correlation between the periods and black hole mass is smeared out due to the large scatter of mass measurements .",
    "we now turn to calculate the following four characteristic periods of accretion disks surrounding single black holes to test if they can account for the observed periods .    for the standard accretion disk model",
    ", the photons with a wavelength @xmath65 mainly come from the region with a temperature of @xmath66  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thus have the region for 5100   photons @xmath67 from equation  ( 4 ) , namely , @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the outer part of accretion disks are optically thick and geometrically thin , dominated by gas pressure . in a pioneering paper",
    ", @xcite realized that this region is so distant that it is strongly affected by the vertical self - gravity of the disk rather than the central black hole .",
    "the self - gravity of the disk is @xmath70 , while the vertical force of the gravity is given by @xmath71 . using the mass density of the outer part of accretion disks ( the region  c solution in @xcite )",
    "@xmath72 we have the toomre parameter , defined by the ratio of the vertical force of the central black hole to the disk s self - gravity , as @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath75 , the disks become self - gravity dominated .",
    "this yields a critical radius of self - gravity as @xmath76 with two radii of equation ( 5 ) and ( 8) , the corresponding keplerian periods are given by @xmath77 where the subscripts refer to the corresponding radii .",
    "in addition , to account for the region between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we define an averaged radius as @xmath80 and the averaged period as @xmath81    at last , we can also calculate the characteristic period for warped disks . according to @xcite ,",
    "the total mass of the disk within @xmath79 is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the surface density of the disk at @xmath79 .",
    "the warped disks precess with a typical period @xmath84 where @xmath85 is typical radius ( @xmath85=@xmath79 ) of the warped disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pt ] compares the rest - frame @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the top panels , and plots their respective ratios in the bottom panels .",
    "we find that @xmath86 is much longer than @xmath87 , but shorter than @xmath88 , namely @xmath91 .",
    "this motivates us to compare @xmath86 with the mean value of rotational periods between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "as shown by figure  [ fig : pt]_g _ , @xmath86 is greater than @xmath89 , implying that @xmath86 is related to the region between @xmath93 and @xmath94 if the observed periodicity arises from an accretion disk surrounding a single black hole .",
    "figure  [ fig : pt]_h _ shows that @xmath63 is much shorter than the period of warped disks driven by the self - gravity torque , so that we can rule out this possibility for the periodicity .    in next section , under the assumption that the observed periods are associated with smbhb systems , we discuss several possible processes for the periodicity and calculate the blr sizes and separations of these smbhb systems .",
    "as pointed out by g15b , there exist several plausible processes responsible for the periodicity .    1 .   _ a processing jet_. in the sample , by checking the radio band data from the catalog of vla - first survey @xcite",
    ", we found that only 13 candidates are radio - loud , indicating that the periodic variations in most candidates are not caused by a precessing jet .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillation_. @xcite suggested that high - frequency qpos arise from some type of resonance mechanism .",
    "@xcite showed that the observed time - scales ( @xmath95 ) of high - frequency qpos correlate with black hole mass following @xmath96  days .",
    "for g15b sample , the typical value ( @xmath97 days ) is much shorter than observed period . on the other hand , as for low - frequency qpos",
    ", @xcite showed that grs 1915 + 105 has a mass of @xmath98 and exhibits qpo with 1 hz . if we assume that the period @xmath99 , the case of grs 1915 + 105 would mean that the period if qpos of g15b sample , spanning a mass range of @xmath100 , lies in a range between @xmath101 to @xmath102 days ( in observed - frame ) .",
    "this is generally comparable with the range of observed periods in g15b sample .",
    "periodic accretion . _",
    "the orbital motion of binaries induces periodic modulation of mass accretion onto each black hole @xcite , which translates into periodic emissions of the accretion disks .",
    "the issue about this explanation is that the viscous time of an accretion disk , which reflects the timescale of its response to a change in mass accretion rate , is generally much longer than the observed periods of the present sample .",
    "_ relativistic doppler boosting_. recently , @xcite proposed an alternative explanation for the periodicity by relativistic doppler boosting and applied it to the periodic light curve of pg  1302 - 102 . in this model , a large inclination of the binary s orbit is generally required to account for the variation amplitude .",
    "this will rise a concern about the obscuration of the outer dusty torus if the dusty torus is coplanar with the binary s orbit .",
    "5 .   _ warped accretion disk_. the accretion disks are warped due to tidal torques if their spin axis is misaligned with the orbital axis of the binaries . the warps precess along with the binary s orbital motion and eclipse some parts of the disk emissions , leading to periodic variations in the disk emissions .    in a nutshell , we can only generally exclude with certainty the possibility of the precessing jet model and high - frequency qpos for the periodicity . for the other models , we need more observations , in particular spectroscopic data , to test them .    ) with the sizes of broad - line regions ( @xmath1 ) in panels ( _ a , b _ ) . in panel",
    "( _ a _ ) , dotted line is the expected relation .",
    "the bar plotted in the right lower corner represents the typical scatters of @xmath0 . in panel",
    "( _ b _ ) , blue line is the gaussian fit to the distribution .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]      under the assumption that the periodicity arises from a smbhb system , we now calculate the binary s separation , given with the observed period , and compare it against the blr size predicted from the @xmath11 relation . using the kepler s law of @xmath103 and equation ( 2 ) , we have the binary s semi - major axis as @xmath104 this indicates @xmath105 for given @xmath106 and @xmath63 ( figure  [ fig : rr]_a _ ) .",
    "we can also rewrite equation ( 13 ) into @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rr]_b _ shows that @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath1 and in average , @xmath109 in the sample .",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath110 distribution is 0.6 .",
    "this interestingly means that the blrs of the binary have been merged , but the binary black holes are still co - rotating .",
    "we have tested the periodicity of long - term optical variations in a sample of agns from g15b .",
    "the partial correlation analysis shows that the observed periods of g15b sample are uncorrelated with the agn 5100   luminosity , ( total ) black hole mass and accretion rates . by comparing the observed periods with the characteristic periods of accretion disks surrounding single black holes",
    ", we found that the periods generally lies within the keplerian periods that correspond to the regions between the 5100   region and the self - gravity radius .",
    "we discussed several existing explanations for the periodicity in the context of smbhb hypothesis and concluded that further observations ( particularly long - term spectroscopic monitoring ) are required to test if the periodicity originate from smbhb systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , by assuming that observed periodicity is associated with smbhb systems , we calculated the smbhb s separations and found that they are smaller than the sizes of broad - line regions , implying that the binary blrs have been merged .",
