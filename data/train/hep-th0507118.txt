    "throughout history , people have attempted to understand the universe by dividing matter into smaller and smaller pieces .",
    "this approach has proven extremely fruitful : successively smaller distance scales have revealed successively simpler and more fundamental structures . over the last century , the fundamental building blocks of nature have been reduced from atoms to electrons , protons and neutrons , to most recently , the `` elementary '' particles that make up the @xmath1 standard model . today , a great deal of research is devoted to finding even more fundamental building blocks - such as superstrings .",
    "this entire approach is based on the idea of reductionism - the idea that the fundamental nature of particles is revealed by dividing them into smaller pieces .",
    "but reductionism is not always useful or appropriate .",
    "for example , in condensed matter physics there are particles , such as phonons , that are collective excitations involving many atoms .",
    "these particles are `` emergent phenomena '' that can not be meaningfully divided into smaller pieces . instead , we understand them by finding the _ mechanism _ that is responsible for their emergence . in the case of phonons , for example , this mechanism is symmetry breaking.@xcite    this suggests alternate line of inquiry .",
    "could the elementary particles in the standard model be analogous to phonons ?",
    "that is , could they be collective modes of some `` structure '' that we mistake for empty space ?",
    "recent work suggests that they might be .",
    "@xcite this work has revealed the existence of new and exotic phases of matter whose collective excitations are gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "the microscopic degrees of freedom in these models are spins on a lattice - purely local , bosonic objects with local interactions .",
    "there is no trace of gauge boson or fermion degrees of freedom in the underlying lattice model .",
    "the gauge bosons and fermions are thus emergent phenomena - a result of the collective behavior of many spins .",
    "what is the mechanism responsible for their emergence ? in these exotic phases , the spins organize into a special pattern - a particular kind of entangled ground state , which we call a `` string - net condensed '' state .",
    "a string - net condensed state is a spin state where the spins organize into large string - like objects ( or more generally networks of strings ) .",
    "the strings then form a quantum string liquid ( see fig . [ stringnets ] ) .",
    "this kind of ground state naturally gives rise to gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "the gauge bosons correspond to fluctuations in the strings - the collective motions of the strings that fill the space .",
    "@xcite the fermions correspond to endpoints of the strings - that is , defects in the string liquid where a string ends in empty space .",
    "@xcite    what makes the string - net picture particularly compelling is that the gauge bosons and fermions naturally emerge _",
    "together_. they are just different aspects of the same underlying structure .",
    "therefore , if we believe that the vacuum is such a string - net condensate then the presence of gauge interactions and fermi statistics in the standard model is no longer mysterious .",
    "string - net condensation explains what gauge bosons and fermions are , why they exist , and why they appear together .",
    "@xcite    the general theory of string - net condensation was worked out in .",
    "one of the main results in that paper was a series of exactly soluble models realizing all possible string - net condensates .",
    "these models are quite general and can realize gauge bosons with any gauge group",
    ". however , they are also complicated when discussed in full generality , and did not provide an explicit example of the most physically relevant case - a model realizing gauge bosons and fermions in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .    in this paper , we attempt to remedy this problem .",
    "we demonstrate the string - net picture of ( 3 + 1)d emerging gauge bosons and fermions with concrete lattice models .",
    "we describe a rotor model on the cubic lattice that produces both @xmath0 gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "the fermions can be gapped excitations ( as in an insulator ) or gapless ( as in a fermi liquid )",
    ". they can also behave like massless dirac fermions . in this case",
    ", the low energy physics of the rotor model is identical to massless quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the rotor model can then be viewed as a `` quantum ether '' : a medium that gives rise to both photons and electrons .",
    "in addition , the rotor model is closely related to @xmath0 lattice gauge theory coupled to a higgs field .",
    "it demonstrates that a simple modification or `` twist '' can change the higgs boson into a fermion .",
    "while this is not the first lattice bosonic model with emergent massless gauge bosons and massless dirac fermions @xcite , it has two characteristics which distinguish it from previous examples .",
    "first , the mapping between the rotor model and qed is essentially exact , and does not require a large @xmath2 limit or similar approximation .",
    "second , the rotor model is a special case of a general construction , @xcite , unlike the other models which were in some sense , discovered by accident .",
    "it therefore provides a deeper understanding of emergent fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "in addition to its relevance to high energy physics , this understanding may prove useful to condensed matter physics , particularly the search for phases of matter with exotic low energy behavior .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin with a `` warm - up '' calculation in section ii - a rotor model with emergent photons and _ bosonic _ charges .",
    "this model is closely related to @xmath0 lattice gauge theory coupled to a higgs field .",
    "then , in section iii , we show that the rotor model can be modified in a natural way by adding a phase factor or `` twist '' to a term in the hamiltonian .",
    "this modified or `` twisted '' rotor model has ( massive ) fermionic charges . in section",
    "iv , we describe further modifications which give rise to gapless fermi liquids and massless dirac fermions .",
    "in this section , we present a warm - up example - a rotor model with emergent photons and _ bosonic _ charges .",
    "this model is closely related to @xmath0 lattice gauge theory coupled to a higgs field . while a number of other similar models @xcite have been analyzed previously , this model has the advantage of being quasi - exactly soluble , and generalizing easily to the fermionic case .",
    "the string - net picture of the ground state is also particularly evident in this case .      ) .",
    "the term @xmath3 acts on the six `` legs '' of @xmath4 - that is , the six rotors adjacent to @xmath4 , drawn above as filled dots .",
    "the term @xmath5 acts on the four rotors , labeled by @xmath6 , along the boundary of the plaquette @xmath7 . ]",
    "the model is a quantum rotor model with rotors on the links of a cubic lattice .",
    "each rotor can be viewed as a particle moving on a circle .",
    "the position of the particle is given by the angle @xmath8 , and the angular momentum of the particle by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the moment of inertia .",
    "the hamiltonian of the rotor model is given by ( see fig . [ cubbos]a)@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 labels the vertices , @xmath13 labels the links and @xmath7 labels the plaquettes of the cubic lattice .",
    "the `` legs of @xmath4 '' are the six links that are attached to the vertex @xmath4 , and 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 label the four links of the plaquette @xmath7 ( see fig . [ cubbos ] ) .",
    "@xmath14 are the raising / lowering operators of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .      , while all the other rotors ( depicted as empty dots ) have @xmath17 . ]    in this section , we show that the rotor model exhibits string - net condensation in the regime @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , we show that the rotors organize into effective extended objects , namely `` string - nets '' , and the ground state is a quantum liquid of these string - nets .",
    "the string - net condensed ground state has two types of excitations - string collective motions ( which will correspond to photons ) and string endpoints ( which will correspond to charges ) .",
    "the first step is to notice that the @xmath19 operators commute with each other as well as the other terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , we can label all the eigenstates of @xmath20 by their eigenvalues under @xmath19 : @xmath21 . the quantum number @xmath22 - which we will call the `` charge '' on site @xmath4 - takes values in the integers .",
    "clearly the lowest energy charge configuration is the charge-@xmath23 configuration @xmath24 .",
    "other charge configurations cost an additional energy @xmath25 .",
    "hence , in the limit @xmath26 , the low energy physics is completely contained in the charge-@xmath23 sector .",
    "we would like to enumerate the states in the charge-@xmath23 sector .",
    "it is natural to describe these states in terms of extended objects - in particular , string - nets .",
    "the simplest state has @xmath27 for every rotor . in the string - net language , we think of this state as the vacuum",
    ". another state can be obtained by alternately increasing or decreasing @xmath15 by @xmath28 along a loop ( see fig .",
    "[ cubcstr ] ) .",
    "we think of this state as the vacuum with a single ( closed ) string .",
    "other states can be constructed by repeating this process .",
    "one finds that the most general charge-@xmath23 state can have many strings and that the strings can overlap to form networks of strings or `` string - nets . ''",
    "what is the action of the hamiltonian ( [ strneth ] ) on these charge-@xmath23 states ? if we think about the states using the string - net language , we see that the @xmath29-term penalizes strings for being long .",
    "it therefore corresponds to a string tension . on the other hand",
    ", the effect of the @xmath30 operator is to either create a small loop of small string ( if applied to the vacuum ) or to deform the existing strings ( if applied to a more complicated state ) .",
    "thus the @xmath31-term generates string `` hopping '' or string fluctuations .",
    "one can think of it as a string kinetic energy .",
    "there are two regimes to consider . when @xmath32 , the string tension dominates and the ground state contains almost no strings .",
    "the ground state is a `` normal '' state . when @xmath33 , the string kinetic energy dominates and the ground state is a superposition of many large closed strings @xcite .",
    "the ground state is thus `` string - net condensed . ''",
    "we expect a quantum phase transition between these two states at some @xmath34 of order @xmath28 .",
    "we expect that the excitations above the ground state have very different properties in these two regimes . in the string - net condensed case , there are two types of excitations : low energy excitations with charge-@xmath23 and high energy excitations with nonzero charge .    the low energy excitations can be constructed from linear combinations of string - net states .",
    "these excitations can be thought of as collective motions of closed strings .",
    "the high energy , charged , excitations can be constructed from linear combinations of string - net configurations with _",
    "open _ strings .",
    "for example , if one takes the vacuum state @xmath17 and alternately increases and decreases @xmath15 along an open path @xmath35 , the resulting state has nonzero charge at the two ends of @xmath35 .",
    "this is true quite generally : nonzero charge configurations are made up of open string - nets - with the charge located at the endpoints of the open strings .",
    "we can think of the string endpoints as point defects in the condensate .",
    "the higher energy excitations are composed out of these point defects .",
    "the defects carry a quantum number - charge - which is measured by the operator @xmath19 .      in this section",
    ", we examine the rotor model more quantitatively .",
    "we show that the low energy physics of the rotor model ( [ strneth ] ) is described by compact @xmath0 gauge theory coupled to infinitely massive charges .",
    "the two types of excitations discussed in the previous section have a natural interpretation in terms of the gauge theory .",
    "the collective motions of the strings give rise to gapless excitations and behave like photons , while the point defects ( the endpoints of the strings ) are gapped and behave like charged particles .    in the gauge theory language ,",
    "the strength of the interaction between the photons ( the gauge field ) and the charges is characterized by a `` fine structure constant '' @xmath36 .",
    "the `` fine structure constant '' also characterizes the strength of quantum fluctuations of the gauge field .",
    "when @xmath37 , the quantum fluctuations are so large that the gauge theory is in the confining phase and there are no gauge bosons at low energies .",
    "the gauge bosons ( such as photons ) can exist at low energies only in the deconfined phase when @xmath36 is small .    in the following",
    ", we will show that the `` fine structure constant '' @xmath36 of the gauge theory is of order @xmath38 .",
    "the `` speed of light '' @xmath39 is of order @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the lattice constant .",
    "this result provides insight into the phase transition between the normal and string - net condensed states : the normal state corresponds to the large @xmath36 confining phase of the gauge theory , while the string - net condensed state corresponds to the small @xmath36 deconfined phase .",
    "the string - net condensation transition is the usual confinement - deconfinement transition from gauge theory .",
    "the simplest way to derive these results is to map ( [ strneth ] ) onto a lattice gauge theory hamiltonian . consider the following hamiltonian for compact @xmath0 gauge field coupled to a charge-@xmath28 higgs field",
    "@xmath42 : @xmath43 here , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is an alternative notation for links @xmath13 , and plaquettes @xmath7 in the cubic lattice .",
    "the operator @xmath46 is the integer valued electric field , canonically conjugate to the vector potential : @xmath47 = i$ ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath48 is the occupation number operator canonically conjugate to the higgs field : @xmath49 = i$ ] .    in lattice gauge theory ,",
    "one is interested in the properties of this hamiltonian within the gauge invariant subspace where gauss law holds : @xmath50 our claim is that within this gauge invariant subspace , @xmath51 is mathematically equivalent to @xmath20 . to see this , note that the electric field operators and the occupation number operators all commute with each other .",
    "so the lattice gauge theory model has a complete basis consisting of states @xmath52 with electric field @xmath53 , and occupation number @xmath48 , @xmath54 similarly , the rotor model @xmath20 has a complete basis consisting of states @xmath55 with angular momentum @xmath56 .    on can map the rotor model hilbert space onto the gauge invariant subspace of the lattice gauge theory by mapping the basis state @xmath55 onto the basis state @xmath57 given by @xmath58 ( here @xmath13 is the link connecting sites @xmath4 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "clearly , this correspondence maps the operators @xmath48 and @xmath46 onto the operators @xmath19 and @xmath60 .",
    "one can also show that this correspondence maps @xmath61 onto @xmath62 and @xmath63 onto @xmath64 .",
    "examining the two hamiltonians , we conclude that the gauge theory _ in the special case @xmath65 _ can be mapped onto the rotor model .",
    "the physics of the rotor model ( [ strneth ] ) is therefore completely equivalent to a @xmath0 gauge field coupled to bosonic charges .",
    "the fine structure constant @xmath36 and speed of light @xmath39 can be computed using the lattice gauge theory hamiltonian ( [ lgth ] ) ) . @xcite as for the mass of the charges , the rotor model ( [ strneth ] ) corresponds to the special case where @xmath66 - the case where the charges are infinitely massive and have no dynamics .      in the previous section",
    ", we discovered that the point defect excitations have an infinite mass .",
    "this is not surprising , since the operator @xmath19 commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ strneth ] ) , and hence charge configurations are completely static .",
    "we would like to modify @xmath67 so that the point defects ( or `` charges '' ) do have dynamics . to do this ,",
    "we need to add a term , @xmath68 , to the hamiltonian that does nt commute with @xmath19 .",
    "such a term will make the charges hop from site to site .",
    "we expect that any @xmath68 will give rise to the small qualitative behavior ( e.g. same particle statistics ) .",
    "we therefore consider the simplest hopping term : @xmath69 it s easy to see that this term makes the charges hop from site to site just as in a nearest neighbor tight binding model .",
    "in fact , if we examine the mapping , ( [ lgtmap ] ) , we see that @xmath68 corresponds exactly with the nearest neighbor hopping term in lattice gauge theory , @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the low energy physics of the rotor hamiltonian @xmath71 is equivalent to that of a @xmath0 gauge field coupled to charges with _ finite _ mass .      in this section ,",
    "we compute the statistics of the charges and show that they are bosons .",
    "the main purpose of this computation is to facilitate comparison with the `` twisted '' rotor model .",
    "( indeed , the fact that the charges are bosons follows immediately from the exact mapping to lattice gauge theory , ) .",
    "it is easiest to perform the computation in the case @xmath72 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath30 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath73 .",
    "we can therefore divide the hilbert space into different sectors @xmath74 corresponding to different flux configurations @xmath75 .",
    "a complete basis for each sector can be obtained by listing all the different charge configurations @xmath21 .",
    "the action of the hamiltonian @xmath73 on a charge configuration @xmath21 is simple .",
    "the first part of the hamiltonian , @xmath67 , does nt affect the charge configuration at all , while the second part , @xmath68 acts in two ways : it either creates two charges at neighboring sites , or it makes a charge hop from one site to another .    thus , within each sector , @xmath76 is simply a hopping hamiltonian on the cubic lattice .",
    "the hopping operators @xmath77 make the charges hop from site @xmath4 to site @xmath59 , where @xmath78 are the two endpoints of @xmath13 .",
    "to compute the statistics of the charges , we use the statistical hopping operator algebra described in .",
    "we note that the hopping operators satisfy the algebra @xmath79 for any @xmath80 incident to some vertex @xmath4 . according to , this is the bosonic hopping operator algebra .",
    "we conclude that the charged particles are bosons .",
    "in this section , we present another rotor model which is very closely related to the model from the previous section , ( [ strneth ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian only differs from @xmath67 by a `` twist '' - an additional phase factor in the @xmath30 term . despite the apparent similarity",
    ", we will see that this `` twisted '' rotor model gives rise to emergent photons and _ fermionic _ charges .",
    "the relationship between the twisted and untwisted models is a special case of a general relationship between fermionic and bosonic string - net condensates .",

    ", we first discuss the `` twisted string operator . ''",
    "we begin with the original `` untwisted '' rotor model @xmath20 .",

    "this `` untwisted '' string operator has an important property .",
    "when @xmath82 is a closed curve , @xmath89 commutes with all charge operators and all other closed string operators : @xmath93 =   [ w(c'),w(c ) ] = 0\\ ] ] this property is essential for the mapping to lattice gauge theory ( [ lgtmap ] ) to hold .",
    "it implies that the @xmath89 can be simultaneously diagonalized within a given charge sector .",
    "the simultaneous eigenstates can then be interpreted as different flux configurations , and the @xmath89 can be interpreted as wilson loop operators measuring the flux through a curve @xmath82 .",
    "it turns out that there is another string operator - which we call the `` twisted string operator '' - that also has this property .",
    "the twisted string operator @xmath94 is similar to the usual string operator @xmath89 except that it contains an additional phase factor that depends on rotors on the `` legs '' of @xmath82 - that is , rotors on the links incident to vertices @xmath95 along the curve @xmath82 .    to define @xmath94",
    ", one must first choose a projection of the @xmath96 lattice onto a @xmath81 plane .",

    "[ twstr](a ) .",
    "the twisted string operator is then defined by @xmath97 here , @xmath98 is the number of times that the link @xmath13 crosses the curve @xmath83 , where @xmath83 is some `` framing '' of @xmath82 .",
    "a `` framing '' is a curve @xmath83 drawn next to @xmath82 , but not exactly on it ( see fig . [ twstr](b ) ) .",

    "the first part of the hamiltonian , @xmath121 , does nt affect the charge configuration at all , while the second part , @xmath122 acts in two ways : it either creates two charges at neighboring sites , or it makes a charge hop from one site to another .    thus , within each sector , @xmath145 is simply a hopping hamiltonian on the cubic lattice .",
    "the hopping operators @xmath128 make the charges hop from site @xmath4 to site @xmath59 , where @xmath78 are the two endpoints of @xmath13 . to compute the statistics of the charges , we use the statistical hopping operator algebra @xcite , just as in the untwisted case .",
    "we find that the hopping operators satisfy the same algebra but with a @xmath146 sign .",
    "that is , @xmath147 for any @xmath80 incident to some vertex @xmath4 .",
    "this sign makes all the difference .",
    "the above algebra is not the bosonic hopping operator algebra , but rather the _ fermionic _ hopping algebra .",
    "we conclude that in the twisted rotor model the charged particles are fermions .",
    "one might expect that , by analogy with the untwisted case , there is a mapping to fermionic lattice gauge theory .",
    "however , no such mapping exists .",
    "the reason is that , at the lattice scale , these fermions behave differently from the usual fermions in a tight binding model .",
    "there are two key differences .",
    "first , in a standard tight binding model of spinless fermions , each site can be occupied by @xmath23 or @xmath28 fermion .",
    "however , in our case the charge @xmath19 can be any integer from @xmath148 to @xmath149 .",
    "thus , a given site can be occupied by arbitrarily many fermions .",
    "second , in a standard tight binding model , the fermions are totally noninteracting in the zero coupling limit @xmath150 .",
    "however , in our case the the fermions do interact , even in this limit .",
    "for example , the hopping term @xmath68 allows positive and negatively charged fermions to annihilate each other if they occupy neighboring sites .",
    "neither of these differences should affect the physics of the twisted rotor model in the low energy limit , if @xmath25 is large .",
    "in that case , the low energy physics of the rotor model is equivalent to an insulator : it is described by two species of gapped fermions with opposite charges coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "however , these microscopic differences could be important when @xmath25 becomes small enough that a fermi surface develops .",
    "unfortunately , in order to construct massless dirac fermions , we need to consider that limit .",
    "therefore , in order to make our calculation well - controlled , we need to modify the twisted rotor model so that the fermions are equivalent to tight binding model fermions , _ even at the lattice scale_. this is the subject of the next section .",
    "in this section , we modify the twisted rotor model @xmath151 so that the fermions are exactly equivalent to tight binding model fermions .",
    "we then show that this more well - controlled model can give rise to massless dirac fermions .",
    "it can also give rise to fermi liquid behavior .",
    "there are many ways to make the fermions in @xmath151 behave like the usual fermions from a tight binding model . here",
    "we will only describe one of them .",
    "first , we divide the vertices of the cubic lattice into @xmath135 classes : `` @xmath152 vertices '' , `` @xmath153 vertices '' and `` mixed vertices . ''",
    "a vertex is called an @xmath152 vertex if the three components @xmath154 are all even , an @xmath153 vertex if the three components @xmath154 are all odd , and a mixed vertex otherwise .",
    "we then modify the @xmath25 term in ( [ strneth ] ) to @xmath155 throughout our discussion we will take the @xmath156 limit . in this limit , @xmath19 must be @xmath157 on the @xmath152 vertices , @xmath158 on the @xmath153 vertices , and @xmath23 on the mixed vertices . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath0 charges can only live on the @xmath152 or @xmath153 vertices , and these two sublattices can only contain unit positive and negative charges respectively .",
    "next , we modify the hopping hamiltonian @xmath159 to @xmath160 where the sum runs over pairs of neighboring links @xmath161 which are collinear and can be joined together to form a single line segment of length @xmath138",
    ". this hopping term has the property that charges only move within the @xmath152 and @xmath153 sublattices .",
    "putting this all together , and including a term which will correspond to a chemical potential @xmath162 , we arrive at the following rotor model : @xmath163      we begin by considering the case where @xmath164 . in this case",
    "@xmath165 is exactly soluble .",
    "indeed , the basis states @xmath166 are eigenstates of @xmath165 with an energy @xmath167 as we mentioned earlier , we will take the @xmath168 limit . in this limit ,",
    "the only low energy states are those with @xmath169 in the @xmath152 sublattice , @xmath170 in the @xmath153 sublattice and @xmath171 everywhere else .",
    "if we restrict to this low energy subspace , the energy @xmath172 is simply given by @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the total number of charged particles .",
    "now , consider the case @xmath175 .",
    "the @xmath176 term generates nearest neighbor hopping in the @xmath152 and @xmath153 sublattices .",
    "if we let @xmath35 denote the projection onto the low energy subspace , then the action of the hopping hamiltonian ( [ ffhop ] ) within this subspace can be written as @xmath177 where @xmath178 runs over the unit vectors @xmath179 and the @xmath180 are hopping operators that make the particles hop from site @xmath181 to site @xmath4 .",
    "they are defined by @xmath182 where @xmath13 is the link connecting @xmath183 , @xmath184 is the link connecting @xmath185 , and we use the upper ( lower ) signs for the @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) sublattices .    the low energy effective hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath186 this hamiltonian describes two types of hardcore charged particles with charges @xmath110 hopping on two different sublattices .",
    "we can completely characterize this hamiltonian by investigating two physical properties : the statistics of the charges , and the gauge flux through each plaquette @xmath7 .    to determine the statistics of the charges , we use the statistical hopping operator algebra .",
    "@xcite we notice that the hopping operators satisfy the relation @xmath187 for any @xmath188 adjacent to @xmath4 . according to @xcite , this is the fermionic hopping operator algebra , so the particles are fermions .",
    "to determine the flux that the particles see , we compute the product of hopping operators around a @xmath189 plaquette @xmath190 in the @xmath152 or @xmath153 sublattice .",
    "we find that ( up to some signs having to do with orientation conventions ) , @xmath191 here the sum on the right hand side runs over the @xmath192 plaquettes in the original lattice that are contained in the ( doubled ) plaquette @xmath190 .",
    "also , @xmath193 denotes the occupation number of site @xmath4 .",
    "this relation implies that the particles see a flux @xmath114 through each plaquette @xmath7 .",
    "the hopping operators @xmath194 are completely characterized by the two algebraic relations ( [ ferhop]),([ferflux ] ) .",
    "any collection of hardcore hopping operators that satisfy these relations will give rise to a hamiltonian equivalent to ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "a particularly simple collection of hopping operators satisfying these relations can be constructed from fermionic operators @xmath195 with @xmath196 the hopping operators are given by @xmath197 where the upper ( lower ) sign applies to the @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) sublattice and @xmath198 are phases defined on each link satisfying @xmath199 for any closed curve @xmath82 .",
    "in other words , @xmath200 is a vector potential for the flux configuration @xmath114 .",
    "rewriting the low energy effective hamiltonian in terms of these fermionic operators gives @xmath201 note that this is nothing other than the standard tight binding hamiltonian for fermions hopping in fixed flux configurations @xmath114 .",
    "if we now allow @xmath202 , then the flux configurations acquire dynamics .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hfree ] ) becomes modified by the addition of an electric energy term @xmath203 , where @xmath46 is canonically conjugate to @xmath204 : @xmath205 = i$ ] .",
    "this term is precisely what one needs for compact lattice @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "we conclude that in the general case @xmath206 , the twisted rotor model ( [ hff ] ) is mathematically equivalent to a tight binding model with @xmath110 charged fermions coupled to a compact @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath207 naturally gives rise to fermi liquid behavior .",
    "this is easiest to understand in the regime @xmath208 . in this case",
    ", the minimum energy flux configuration is the configuration @xmath209 .",
    "the flux @xmath114 fluctuates about this minima giving rise to photon - like excitations .",
    "the fermion dispersion in the background flux configuration is given by @xmath210 the ground state is obtained by filling all the negative energy levels . clearly , the model behaves differently for different values of chemical potential @xmath162 . if @xmath211 , then there are no negative energy levels .",
    "all the energy levels are empty in the ground state , and the system is an insulator . in this case ,",
    "the rotor model ( [ hff ] ) describes gapped fermions with a gap @xmath212 coupled to a compact @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "the fermions come in two species ( corresponding to the two sublattices , @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) with charges @xmath213 and @xmath214 , respectively .",
    "hence , just like the original twisted rotor model @xmath145 , the physics is equivalent to that of a @xmath0 gauge field coupled to two species of gapped fermions with opposite charges .    on the other hand , if @xmath215 , then the result is a fermi liquid - or more precisely two fermi liquids corresponding to the two species of fermions .",
    "these two fermi liquids are both coupled to a compact @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "the model ( [ hfree ] ) can also give rise to massless dirac fermions .",
    "indeed , massless dirac fermions can occur whenever the fermion band structure has nodal points .",
    "this happens naturally in a @xmath216-flux configuration where each plaquette contains a flux of @xmath216 . in our case , the relevant plaquettes are not plaquettes @xmath7 in the original cubic lattice , but rather `` doubled '' @xmath189 plaquettes in the @xmath152 and @xmath153 sublattices . one way to ensure that the flux through these `` doubled '' plaquettes is @xmath216 , is to introduce a spatial dependence into the parameter @xmath176 .",
    "that is replace @xmath176 by @xmath217 where @xmath218 on the @xmath152 sublattice and @xmath219 on the @xmath153 sublattice .",
    "the result is that becomes modified so that each fermion sees an effective flux of @xmath220 through each doubled plaquette @xmath190 .",
    "the minimum energy flux configuration is still @xmath209 , but now the fermions see an effective flux of @xmath216 through each doubled plaquette .",
    "the fermion dispersion in this background is given by @xmath138 pairs of degenerate bands with energies @xmath221 and brilluoin zone , @xmath222 .",
    "the ground state of @xmath223 is again obtained by filling all the levels with negative energies . if @xmath224 , then the fermi surface consists of @xmath138 nodal points with linear dispersion - at @xmath225 .",
    "the low energy fermionic excitations are concentrated near these @xmath138 nodes .",
    "together , the two nodes give rise to one four - component dirac fermion in the continuum limit .",
    "since the bands are doubly degenerate , and there are two species of fermions ( corresponding to the @xmath152 and @xmath153 sublattice ) , there are a total of @xmath192 massless four component dirac fermions .    we conclude that the low energy physics of the rotor model @xmath165 with @xmath224 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath176 given by the above formula , is equivalent to qed with four species of massless dirac fermions .",
    "thus , @xmath165 is a local bosonic model that gives rise to both photons and massless fermions .",
    "it can be viewed as a realization of a quantum ether - an ether that produces not only light , but also electrons !",
    "we would like to point out that the speed of light @xmath228 and the speed of the massless dirac fermion @xmath229 are not the same in our rotor model .",
    "however , we can tune the value of @xmath176 to make @xmath230 . in this case the low energy effective theory will have lorentz invariance . the reason that we do not get a lorentz invariant low energy",
    "effective theory naturally is that our approach is based on hamiltonian formalism where space and time are treated very differently .",
    "if one uses a path integral formalism and discretizes space and time in the same way , lorentz invariance can emerge naturally in a low energy effective theory .",
    "another difficulty with the above model is that the emergent electrons are massless .",
    "however , this problem can also be overcome : when bosonic models contain emergent non - abelian gauge bosons , the models can produce electrons with a _",
    "finite _ mass and such a mass can be much less than the cut - off scale without fine tuning any parameters .",
    "in this paper we have explicitly demonstrated the string - net picture of ( 3 + 1)d emerging gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "we presented a rotor model on the cubic lattice with a string - net condensed ground state , and excitations which behave just like massless photons and massless dirac fermions .",
    "we saw that the model was closely related to @xmath0 lattice gauge theory coupled to a higgs field .",
    "the only real difference was a phase factor or `` twist '' in the hamiltonian .",
    "surprisingly , this `` twist '' was enough to turn the higgs boson into a fermion .",
    "this model is part of a much more general construction @xcite that can produce gauge bosons with any gauge group . in particular",
    ", one should be able to construct a model that gives rise to @xmath231 gauge bosons and massless dirac fermions - that is , qcd . these models could have applications to lattice gauge theory .",
    "they may make it possible to simulate qed with electrons and qcd with quarks without ever introducing quark or electron degrees of freedom on the sites . only the link variables ( representing the gauge field )",
    "would be necessary in such a simulation .    from a high energy point of view",
    ", the string - net picture of the vacuum is quite appealing .",
    "it explains why the standard model looks the way it does - that is , why nature chooses such peculiar things as gauge bosons and fermions to describe itself .",
    "in addition , it unifies the mysterious gauge symmetries and anticommuting fields into a single underlying structure : a string - net condensate .",
    "but can we actually construct a string - condensed local bosonic model that produces the entire standard model ?",
    "we are close , but not quite there . in terms of elementary particles",
    "we can produce photons , gluons , leptons and quarks , but we do not know how to produce neutrinos or @xmath232 gauge bosons .",
    "the problem with the neutrinos and the @xmath232 gauge bosons is the famous chiral - fermion problem .",
    "@xcite neutrinos are chiral fermions and the @xmath232 gauge bosons couple chirally to other fermions . at the moment",
    ", we do not know how to obtain chiral fermions and chiral gauge theories from _ any _ local lattice model , much less a local bosonic model .    from a condensed matter point of view , the above model shows how a simple spin system can give rise to emergent fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "extended objects can give rise to both of these phenomena , as long as their condensate has an appropriate `` twist . ''",
    "this may provide intuition in the search for new and exotic phases of matter - phases beyond the scope of landay s theory of symmetry breaking .",
    "the discovery of a real material with string - net condensation would represent a breakthrough , particularly a material containing excitations which behave just like the photons and electrons in our vacuum ."
