    "<S> a cl vacancy in the outermost layer of this supported nacl bilayer is analogous to the widely studied and well - known colour centers in bulk nacl  @xcite with one key difference : the localized vs is unoccupied because the electron can tunnel into unoccupied metal states . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : tbmodel]a . </S>",
    "<S> this finding can be rationalized by the larger spatial extent of the eigenstates , which decreases their relaxation energy and accordingly the effective electron  phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> + in the following , the vs energies of the 3nn chains are compared with the results from a simple tight - binding ( tb ) model . </S>",
    "<S> first , we assume that each vacancy in the chain has an on - site energy @xmath14 and is coupled to its next neighbour(s ) with a hopping term @xmath15 , as sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tbmodel]b . by adjusting the free fitting parameters @xmath14 and @xmath16 to the experimental mono- and divacancy vs energies </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : tbmodel]e . in comparison with the experimental energy spectrum , depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tbmodel]d , the level spacings for each chain could be roughly reproduced , but the tb model does not capture the shift of the band center towards lower energies with increasing chain length . </S>",
    "<S> this shift can be explained by the electrostatic interaction between adjacent vacancies that deepens the potential at each vacancy and therefore lowers the on - site energy . </S>",
    "<S> to account for the energy shift we introduce the parameter @xmath17 , which is the on - site energy shift due to a neighbouring vacancy ( see fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : split_divac]e has a similar shape as two gaussians with a fwhm reduced by almost @xmath38 as compared to an isolated vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> this decrease of the broadening in the uncorrelated case is the underlying reason why the observed broadenings of the levels of the chains decrease with chain size ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> + the two phonon modes considered here affect only one of the vss each and result in uncorrelated vacancy site energy fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in reality , however , a given individual phonon mode may act on the energy of both vacancies in a symmetric or antisymmetric fashion ( consider e.g. the motion of an ion centered between two vacancies ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , partially correlated vacancy site energy fluctuations can not be excluded . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the si , the two einstein modes and their symmetric and antisymmetric fluctuations can serve as a basis for the description of any phonon bath and electron  phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results are consistent with the assumption of fully uncorrelated fluctuations of the two vss . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in the uncorrelated case , the ldos , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : split_divac]e ( red line ) , exhibits two peaks with an apparent separation that is substantially larger than the intrinsic splitting of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is a characteristic effect of the level repulsion between @xmath23 and @xmath24 and is in sharp contrast compared to a superposition of two monovacancy resonances separated by the intrinsic splitting ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : split_divac]e ( blue line ) ) . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , one would not be able to identify separate peaks due to the larger broadening and smaller splitting . </S>",
    "<S> + the enhancement of the apparent peak separation in the uncorrelated case over the intrinsic splitting is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : split_divac]f as a function of the scaled intrinsic energy splitting @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the broadening of a single vs. we define the apparent peak separation @xmath41 as the separation between the centers of the two gaussian lineshapes with broadening ( fwhm ) @xmath42 fitted to the calculated ldos . </S>",
    "<S> the relative enhancement @xmath43 of the apparent splitting is most important for small @xmath16 . for large @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , the splitting of divacancy energy levels approaches the intrinsic energy splitting of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> as for the single vacancy level , the broadening of a divacancy level then scales with the square root of its relaxation energy ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> + the hopping terms @xmath16 can be extracted from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : split_divac]f by taking @xmath41 equal to the observed splitting and using the single vacancy value 0.27 ev for @xmath40 . for example </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath44 ev was obtained from @xmath45 ev for the 3nn divacancy . </S>",
    "<S> the values obtained for the hopping terms @xmath16 are very reasonable as supported by density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations of the unoccupied kohn  sham states of cl divacancies in nacl(2ml)/cu(111 ) . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : split_divac]f , the calculated values for @xmath20 of the various divacancy configurations are close to the values for the intrinsic splittings extracted from experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> however , the absolute divacancy energies are underestimated by the dft calculations , as expected ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s3e ) . </S>",
    "<S> + the coupling between the liss of cl divacancies and chains were studied in a simple , multiple @xmath40-wave scattering model of the interface - state scattering from the positively charged vacancies ( see methods and si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results from this model , as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : didv_divac]l - o , are able to fully capture the observed behavior of the coupled liss . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a lis doublet below the onset of the interface - state band is simply understood by the relatively strong interaction between the weakly bound liss of the two vacancies at small intervacancy distances . with increasing distances between the vacancies , this interaction decreases , and a second lis appears below the band onset . </S>",
    "<S> the observed symmetric character of the lis below the band edge and antisymmetric character of the extended lis above @xmath46 for the 3nn vacancy are also revealed in the calculated ldos images ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the obtained energies for the liss of the vacancy chains are in excellent agreement with the experiments , as indicated in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : vac_chains]b . </S>",
    "<S> + in summary , from an afm and sts study we find that the localized vss and liss at intentionally created cl divacancies in a nacl bilayer on cu(111 ) form symmetric and antisymmetric states , in analogy to the bonding and antibonding orbitals of a hydrogen molecule . as expected , the energy splitting between these states increases with decreasing intervacancy distance . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with theory shows that the energy splitting of the vss is significantly enlarged by the strong coupling of the tunneling electrons with phonons in the nacl film . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , vss and liss of vacancy chains form one - dimensional quantum - well states . </S>",
    "<S> the vs levels of the chains could be well described by a simple tight - binding model that takes the electrostatic interaction between neighbouring vacancies into account . </S>",
    "<S> the model provides also a microscopic understanding why the level broadening is reduced with increasing chain size . </S>",
    "<S> already for about five coupled vacancies , a one - dimensional electronic band structure evolves . </S>"
