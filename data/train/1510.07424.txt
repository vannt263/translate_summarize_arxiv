    "one of the most celebrated results in microeconomic theory is the gibbard - satterthwaite theorem @xcite , which states that every strategyproof and pareto - optimal social choice function is a dictatorship .",
    "however , the theorem crucially relies on the assumption that outcomes are deterministic .",
    "@xcite later considered social decision schemes , social choice functions that return lotteries over the alternatives , and showed that the class of strategyproof and _ ex post _ efficient functions extends to all random dictatorships .",
    "this class contains a unique rule that treats all agents equally : the uniform random dictatorship , henceforth _ random dictatorship ( @xmath0 ) _ , where an agent is chosen uniformly at random and his favorite alternative is implemented as the social choice .",
    "gibbard s notion of strategyproofness is based on _ stochastic dominance _ and prescribes that no voter can obtain more utility by misrepresenting his preferences no matter what his utility function is ( as long as it is consistent with his ordinal preferences ) .",
    "another implicit assumption in gibbard s theorem is the anti - symmetry of individual preferences .",
    "characterizations of strategyproof social decision schemes for the case when agents are allowed to express indifference have also been explored . in the context of cardinal decision schemes , @xcite",

    "show that the only reasonable strategyproof social decision schemes are weak random dictatorships .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a discussion of these results .",
    "perhaps the best - known generalization of @xmath0 to weak preferences is _ random serial dictatorship ( @xmath1 ) _ where a permutation of agents is chosen uniformly at random and agents narrow down the set of alternatives in that order to their most preferred alternatives among the remaining alternatives .",
    "@xmath1 is also _ ex post _ efficient and strategyproof with respect to stochastic dominance .",
    "however , in contrast to @xmath0 it is not efficient with respect to stochastic dominance , there might be a lottery that yields more expected utility for all agents .",
    "this failure of efficiency was first observed by @xcite in the context of random assignment .",
    "we show that this is not a weakness specific to @xmath1 but in fact all fair generalizations of @xmath0 violate either efficiency or strategyproofness , even when significantly weakening the required degree of strategyproofness . to weak preferences ,",

    "we will compactly represent a preference relation as a comma - separated list with all alternatives among which an agent is indifferent placed in a set .",

    "in order to reason about the outcomes of sdss , we need to make assumptions on how agents compare lotteries . a common way to extend preferences over alternatives to preferences over lotteries is _ stochastic dominance ( @xmath51)_. a lottery @xmath51-dominates another if , for every alternative @xmath31 , the former is at least as likely to yield an alternative at least as good as @xmath31 as the latter .",

    "strategyproofness prescribes that no agent can obtain a more preferred outcome by misrepresenting his preferences .",
    "there are two notions of strategyproofness associated with stochastic dominance ; they differ in the interpretation of incomparabilities and ties . the weak notion , which we will just call @xmath51-strategyproofness , prescribes that no agent can obtain an @xmath51-preferred outcome by lying about his preferences . formally , an sds @xmath44 is @xmath51-manipulable if there exist @xmath66 and @xmath39 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
