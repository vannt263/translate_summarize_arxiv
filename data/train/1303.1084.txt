    "both the atlas and cms collaborations have reported the discovery of a resonance with a mass of around @xmath2 gev , immediately associated with the long - sought after higgs boson  @xcite . with this discovery ,",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is considered to be complete . however , such low mass is incompatible   with the stability of the sm up to the planck scale ( @xmath3 ) , as newly confirmed by a 2-loop analysis of the scalar potential  @xcite ( see , however ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it is also known that simple extensions of the sm can ameliorate this behavior .",
    "it is sufficient to enlarge the scalar sector by means of a singlet scalar field to restore the validity of the sm up to very large scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nonetheless , other problems are still unsolved , for instance the pattern of masses and mixing angles of the neutrinos and the presence of dark matter just to mention a few .",
    "extensions in more sm sectors than only in the scalar one are therefore needed .",
    "a very simple and yet interesting sm extension is the so - called `` minimal @xmath1 models '' , in which the sm gauge group is enlarged by a @xmath4 gauged symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of chiral anomalies requires to minimally include @xmath5 right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos , while the extra @xmath6 symmetry is spontaneously broken by a new complex singlet scalar field , responsible for giving mass to the related @xmath1 boson .",
    "while the scalar and gauge sectors are unambiguous , various realizations exist for the fermion content of the model , that can encompass a gauged type - i seesaw mechanism in its minimal version  @xcite , or the more involved inverse seesaw mechanism if new lepton pairs are included , thereby providing a solution for neutrino masses , dark matter and baryon asymmetry at once  @xcite .",
    "higher fermion representations can be invoked to explain the apparent enhancement in the higgs - to - diphoton signal as recently observed , if one consider negative values for the scalar mixing angle , compatible with lep and lhc observations , as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is a fact that the evolution of the scalar parameters in simple sm extensions does depend only very marginally on the gauge sector and sensibly on the fermions only if the latter are very heavy .",
    "this has explicitly been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , although this reference does not study in detail its consequences .",
    "further , in ref .",
    "@xcite a renormalization group ( rg ) study of the minimal @xmath1 models has been performed when the sm - like higgs mass was not known .",
    "stimulated by these arguments , in this letter we study the constraints that the @xmath2 gev sm - like higgs boson imposes on the minimal @xmath1 models via the 1-loop rg running in the latter , taken as a benchmark for minimal scalar extensions of the sm .",
    "imposing stability up to the planck scale , we are able to determine predictions for the mass of the heavy scalar field and constraints on the scalar mixing angle . in a model - dependent analysis",
    ", we will show the existence of a minimum value for the latter and of an upper value for the mass of the heavy neutrinos , when considering just the minimal case of the type - i seesaw mechanism . for a similar analysis in the sm with rh neutrinos and an effective type - i seesaw mechanism ,",
    "see  @xcite",
    ". we will discuss how all these statements depend upon the @xmath4-breaking scalar vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "we describe here the minimal @xmath1 models . following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the sm gauge group is extended by a gauged @xmath4 symmetry , such that the classical gauge invariant lagrangian obeys the @xmath7 gauge group .    when multiple @xmath6 factors are present , the related gauge fields tend to mix . in a suitable basis with diagonal kinetic terms ,",
    "the mixing is shifted to the covariant derivative . for the neutral sector , this reads @xmath8 the last term of eq .",
    "( [ cov_der ] ) can be rewritten defining an effective coupling @xmath9 and an effective charge @xmath10 , thus @xmath11   factors appearing in the gauge group with the charges that the @xmath1 boson directly couples to ( @xmath12 and @xmath9 , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the notation @xmath13 might generate some confusion . in the following",
    ", we always consider the case of generic mixing between the @xmath14 and @xmath4 gauge groups , where the new @xmath1 boson couples to one such linear combination .",
    "the model in which the @xmath1 boson couples only to the @xmath15 charge , corresponding to @xmath16 , is called ` pure @xmath15 model ' and represents only one specific benchmark model of our generic parameterization . ] . as any other parameter in the lagrangian ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are running parameters , therefore their values ought to be defined at some scale  @xcite .",
    "a discrete set of popular @xmath1 models can be recovered by a suitable definition of both @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "( for more details , see  @xcite and references therein . )",
    "a new complex scalar field @xmath19 is required to provide mass to the further gauge boson .",
    "the scalar potential is then given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath19 are the complex scalar higgs doublet and singlet fields with @xmath15 charges @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "in unitary gauge , we parametrize @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 real and non - negative .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 and @xmath29 the scalar fields of definite masses , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , and we conventionally choose @xmath32 .",
    "further , we call @xmath33 the mixing angle between the real scalar states @xmath34 with @xmath35 . for our numerical study , it is useful to rewrite the parameters in the lagrangian in terms of the physical quantities @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath36 after inversion : @xmath37    generally , a bound on @xmath27 is set by lep measurements . in the type - i seesaw case here",
    "discussed , @xmath38 tev  @xcite .",
    "the latest lhc data  @xcite are interpreted by identifying @xmath28 with the recently observed boson , i.e. , @xmath39 gev , and by restricting @xmath40 .",
    "the latter value is compatible with the observed slight reduction of the higgs tree - level decays , which however still suffer of large uncertainties . finally , the influence of the extra scalar on the sm quartic coupling is to uplift it by a positive quantity given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the sm value .",
    "we have so far described the sectors that all the various realizations of the minimal @xmath1 models have in common . as a representative for the fermion sector , we consider here the type - i seesaw mechanism , that requires to introduce @xmath0 rh neutrino per generation ( @xmath43 , with @xmath44 ) to ensure the vanishing of the chiral anomalies .",
    "the new yukawa interactions are @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 take the values @xmath0 to @xmath5 , where the last term is the majorana contribution and the first term the usual dirac one .",
    "these are the only allowed gauge invariant terms , provided that @xmath48 .",
    "neutrino mass eigenstates , obtained after applying the seesaw mechanism , will be called @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 standing for light ) and @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 standing for heavy ) , where the first ones are the sm - like ones .",

    "notice that sub - leading gauge coupling terms are not shown because they are irrelevant for the discussion , but they have been taken into account in the derivation of the results .",

    "@xcite , and make explicit the model - dependent contribution arising from the fermionic sector . when the neutrinos are relatively light and their yukawa couplings small ( meaning that their contribution can be neglected ) , our results can be interpreted as general for the class of singlet - extended sm theories .",
    "( for similar analyses of the sm with singlet extensions , see  @xcite and references therein . )    for their numerical study , we proceed as in  @xcite , putting boundary conditions at the electroweak ( ew ) scale on the free physical observables : @xmath31 , @xmath33 , @xmath27 , @xmath57 , that we trade for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the impact of the variation of the higgs and top masses within @xmath62 is also considered , being @xmath63 gev and @xmath64 gev , respectively .",
    "finally , gauge parameters are sub - leading in our considerations and need not be specified . for completeness",
    ", we used the same values as in  @xcite .",
    "the free parameters in our study are then @xmath31 ( the heavy higgs mass ) , @xmath33 ( the scalar mixing angle ) , @xmath27 ( the ( @xmath15)-breaking vev ) and @xmath65 ( the heavy neutrino mass when taking neutrinos as mass degenerate ) . the general philosophy is to fix in turn some of the free parameters and scan over the other ones , individuating the allowed regions fulfilling the following set of conditions : @xmath66 ( usually referred to as the `` triviality '' condition .",
    "notice that @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 ( usually referred to as the `` vacuum stability '' condition ) .",
    "the meaning of eqs .",
    "( [ cond_1])([cond_2 ] ) is that the request of perturbativity and the well - definition of the vacuum of the model must be fulfilled at any scale @xmath69 , being @xmath70 the ultimate scale of validity of the theory . in this letter",
    ", we take @xmath71 gev unless otherwise specified . in these equations ,",
    "we have defined a parameter to be `` perturbative '' for values less than unity .",
    "both conditions have been chosen to be most restrictive to show that the model under consideration is a simple sm extension that is viable up to the planck scale and no further completion is required , and to identify the tightest possible bounds in parameter space .",
    "relaxing these conditions ( e.g. , considering @xmath72 or increasing the perturbativity bound ) will lead to results of which our findings are a still valid subset .",
    "regarding eq .",
    "( [ cond_2 ] ) and in particular its second term , notice that , in contrast to the sm in which it is sufficient the higgs self - coupling @xmath73 be positive , in this model said condition can be violated even for positive @xmath74 .",
    "to understand the following results , some considerations on the rges are in place .",
    "first , the reason why extending the sm by a singlet scalar is sufficient to stabilize the rg evolution of the scalar quartic couplings is explicitly shown in eq .",
    "( [ delta_lambda ] ) . through the scalar mixing , larger values for the sm - like quartic coupling @xmath75 are needed to recover the same physical mass .",
    "conversely , the heavy higgs boson @xmath29 contributes additively to the ew boundary condition of @xmath75 , proportionally to the scalar mixing angle .",
    "this means that to obtain the same `` uplifting '' of the coupling to the stability region , larger @xmath29 masses are required when considering smaller mixing angles @xmath33 ( per fixed vev @xmath27 ) .",
    "second , for a fix value of @xmath27 , @xmath31 can not grow indefinitely to compensate for smaller and smaller values of @xmath33 , being limited by the occurrence of a landau pole for @xmath76 .",
    "third , positive and negative values for @xmath33 ( and similarly for @xmath77 in our conventions ) are not symmetric , as clear from eq .",
    "( [ rge_lambda3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the running of @xmath77 via said equation depends on the _ relative _ sign between ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath77 . given that @xmath79 , there will be constructive@xmath80destructive interference when @xmath33 assumes positive@xmath80negative values .",
    "this means that the evolution of @xmath81 is more stable for negative angles , that hence appear to be favored with respect to positive angles .",
    "interestingly , negative values are physically preferred in some cases if one tries to explain the enhancement in the diphoton signal of the sm - like higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "finally , heavy neutrinos can play a role in destabilizing the evolution of @xmath76 , as the top - quark for the sm quartic coupling , if heavy enough ( see eq .",
    "( [ rge_lambda2 ] ) ) . the request of stability of the model up to a certain scale then imposes an upper bound on the rh neutrino yukawa couplings and therefore on the heavy neutrino masses ( per fixed vev ) .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we will consider @xmath82 gev throughout this letter .",
    "[ fig : mh2_qp_a03 ] shows most of these features at once , for @xmath83 tev .",
    "there exist values for @xmath31 that are stable up to the planck scale for negative scalar mixing angles for all the considered top - quark masses , but the similar case for positive values exist only for @xmath84 gev ( i.e. , for the central value of @xmath85 , the model is not stable up to planck scale for positive scalar mixing angle when the vev @xmath27 is small , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mh2_a_qp19 ] ) .",
    "further , it shows that if the rh - neutrino yukawa couplings are large , the model can be stable only up to scales smaller than @xmath3 , again with negative scalar mixing angles being stable for larger scales than the @xmath86 case",
    ". we get that for @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mh2_vs_mhn_03 ] ) , with eq .",
    "( [ delta_lambda ] ) telling that the allowed heavy higgs mass scales with @xmath89 per fixed vev ( i.e. , for @xmath90 , @xmath91 tev is stable up to @xmath3 ) .    )",
    "masses as a function of the validity scale @xmath70 for @xmath92 .",
    "line thickness reflects a @xmath62 variation of the top - quark mass . here , @xmath83 tev .",
    "( allowed masses are in the area inside the black lines ) . ]    the scaling of @xmath31 with @xmath89 is displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : mh2m_am_qp19][fig : mh2_a_qp19 ] , for negative and positive angles , respectively .",
    "it is clear that for small @xmath27 values , negative angles are favored over positive values .",
    "in fact , one needs very large vev values @xmath93 tev for @xmath31@xmath89 combinations stable up to @xmath3 to exist , for positive angles smaller than @xmath94 rads . for negative angles , there exist heavy higgs masses stable up to the planck scale for @xmath95 for @xmath96 tev .",
    "the substantial difference comes from the evolution of @xmath77 , that runs less when negative , such that the violation of vacuum stability is pushed to higher scales . for positive angles",
    ", it occurs instead much earlier , and larger vevs ( per fixed @xmath31 ) are required to keep eq .",
    "( [ cond_2 ] ) satisfied . depending on the ( @xmath15)-breaking vev @xmath27 , figs .",
    "[ fig : mh2m_am_qp19][fig : mh2_a_qp19 ] show that a minimum scalar mixing angle exist ( in absolute value ) , roughly equal to @xmath97 rads for @xmath96 tev . in the positive domain , for @xmath98",
    "tev one needs @xmath99 . for positive angles ,",
    "a @xmath100 precision in the measurement of the higgs cross sections is hence sufficient to test this model for @xmath101 tev .",
    "the lhc is expected to reach this precision , and therefore can easily confirm / exclude this region of the parameter space .",
    "larger vevs and/or negative @xmath33 values ( that allow for much smaller minimum angles ) require higher precision and therefore can be tested only at future linear colliders .",
    "regarding the allowed heavy higgs masses , they do not depend substantially on the vev @xmath27 , because the condition that is restricting the parameter space is given by the triviality bound on @xmath75 , on which @xmath31 impinges via eq .",
    "( [ delta_lambda ] ) , independent from @xmath27 . however , the existence of a minimum scalar angle and its value depend on @xmath27 .",
    "as remarked , one can not grow @xmath31 indefinitely to compensate for smaller @xmath89 due to the appearance of a landau pole for @xmath102 . interestingly , when considering negative angles , violations of vacuum stability appear earlier than the landau pole for @xmath76 when increasing the ( @xmath15)-breaking vev @xmath27 to very large values ( bigger than @xmath103 tev ) , opposite to the previous observation .",
    "this is because @xmath104 ( see eq .  ( [ inversion ] ) ) , i.e. , the boundary condition on @xmath76 gets smaller than the one on @xmath77 for increasing values of @xmath27 , causing violation of the vacuum stability earlier in the running .",
    "[ fig : mh2_vs_mhn_03 ] shows that an upper limit on the heavy neutrino mass also exists for fixed @xmath27 and @xmath89 values , depending on the scale of validity of the model .",
    "this was clear already from fig .",
    "[ fig : mh2_qp_a03 ] and from the behavior of the top - quark in the sm . in the case of the type - i seesaw mechanism under discussion",
    ", heavy neutrinos can not be heavier than about @xmath105 gev when imposing stability up to the planck scale , for @xmath106 .",
    "when @xmath107 , @xmath108 tev .",
    "these values are for @xmath83 and scale naively with it .",
    "the plot shows also a strong sensitivity from the actual top - quark mass , and it reinforces the observation that positive scalar mixing angles are stable up to the planck scale for small @xmath27 values only for top - quark masses smaller than its central value .",
    "we conclude by noticing that , depending on the @xmath1 mass and couplings , heavy neutrinos can be discovered at the lhc ( and possibly at future colliders ) up to masses of @xmath109 tev ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , hence covering the available parameter space for @xmath110 gev and @xmath111 . in this case",
    "the heavy higgs mass must lay around @xmath112 gev , certainly within the range of the lhc at @xmath113 tev for the latter value of @xmath33 .",
    "obviously , a heavier @xmath29 is required as the scalar mixing angle gets smaller , therefore decoupling the former . in this case , also the heavy neutrino can get heavier and hence more difficult to discover .",
