    "recently , there has been considerable experimental activity in studies of pion absorption on two or three nucleons in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "these can be expected to illuminate the role of strong dynamics in few - nucleon systems and also modifications of pion absorption due to the nuclear environment .",
    "certainly , the most direct comparison can be made between absorption on the deuteron and on correlated nucleon pairs in quasifree kinematics .",
    "the latter can be arranged by choosing the so called conjugate angles , which maximise the role of the two - nucleon mechanism , so that the reaction closely resembles the absorption on a deuteron @xcite .",
    "parallel to this experimental activity concentrating on cross section measurements , model predictions were published not only for cross sections but also for spin observables both in positive @xcite and negative @xcite pion absorption on nucleon pairs in @xmath0he .",
    "the former reaction suggested sensitivity of polarization observables on the quasideuteron wave function , which is not the case for the angular distribution . in the denser @xmath0he - nucleus",
    "short - ranged rescattering mechanisms are weighted differently than the long - ranged but oscillatory direct nucleon - nucleon overlap as compared with the free deuteron reaction . however , at least the experimental outgoing proton polarization , although measured for the quasifree kinematics , does not agree with the prediction from the quasifree model @xcite .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not known presently , but one possibility would be the strong initial state interaction of the pion with the target nucleus . in the future ,",
    "more data on quasifree absorption of positive pions are expected for both the outgoing proton polarization and also for the analyzing power @xmath5 of a polarized @xmath0he target @xcite , which might help to analyze these discrepancies in greater detail .",
    "contrary to the disagreement in the positive pion case , a quantitative agreement is obtained for negative pion absorption between data on a proton pair @xcite and theoretical results @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this case a new short - range meson exchange contribution to the two - nucleon axial current , suggested by lee and riska @xcite , has a significant effect @xcite . of course",
    ", a bound diproton does not exist as such , so a direct comparison between free and quasifree process is not possible as in the case for the absorption on a quasideuteron .",
    "however , if in the inverse process @xmath6 the outcoming protons have a small relative momentum , then at this low energy the resonant @xmath7 scattering state may be considered as nearly bound and can be used with some theoretical input for a comparison with the two - body absorption in @xmath0he .",
    "so far , the actual experiments have been performed as @xmath8 but on a deuteron target @xcite and the spin observables show little deviation from the predictions .",
    "however , in this case there is only a rather moderate dependence on the relative two - body wave function .",
    "still , the accuracy of the experiments is sufficient in order to allow in principle to distinguish between several wave functions .    with",
    "the above somewhat confused situation in pion absorption  agreement between theory and experiment in one case , strong discrepancy in the other ",
    "one is tempted to consider another probe for the study of the pair correlations .",
    "if the source of the disagreement is , indeed , the strong initial state @xmath9nucleus interaction , then an obvious choice would be to attempt a similar approach with an electromagnetic probe . in this case",
    "the initial state interaction between the probe and the target nucleus is negligible and one may study the quasi two - nucleon processes in a much cleaner way .",
    "another bonus is that with different quantum numbers due to different couplings this reaction offers somewhat complementary information with respect to pion absorption .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study explicitly to which extent observables in medium energy photodisintegration of @xmath0he in quasifree two - body situations depend on the initial pair wave function . to a large extent",
    "this study will be devoted to the dependence of spin variables which were predicted to be sensitive in the case of pion absorption .",
    "it may be suited for experimental tests , e.g. , at the legs facility at brookhaven with polarized photons @xcite .",
    "preliminary results for cross sections have been published in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is a large amount of work on photodisintegration of both the deuteron @xcite and @xmath0he @xcite also at intermediate energies .",
    "the model of @xcite to be used in this paper has described deuteron photodisintegration rather successfully in the @xmath10-resonance region .",
    "it is now applied to the quasifree situation with modified pair wave functions .",
    "the differences between the predictions using modified pair wave functions and those for the free deuteron case should give an idea about the trends how the experimental results may differ from the free reaction .",
    "conversely , if the theoretical results are sensitive enough to the details of the assumed pair wave functions , the experimental differences may reveal properties of those .",
    "this approach may also allow one to estimate the inportance of three - body effects once the two - body absorption is understood .",
    "earlier theoretical work on photodisintegration of @xmath0he @xcite has considered various one- , two- and three - nucleon mechanisms in the excitation function of one outcoming nucleon at some particular angle . also most experimental results have been presented in this way @xcite .",
    "the first results with polarized photons on @xmath0he@xmath11 from legs confirm the prediction by laget about the importance of three - nucleon effects in general on the one hand and about the existence of a quasi two - body region on the other hand , where two - body mechanisms are by far dominant @xcite .",
    "however , this earlier work does not concentrate on any detailed investigations in the quasifree region , which should be possible at the right momentum and at conjugate angles appropriate to two - body absorption and will be a further subject of this paper as a complement of two - body pion absorption studies .",
    "the only published experimental results close to our explicit two - nucleon approach are those of the kinematically complete tagged - photon experiment of the tagx collaboration @xcite . there",
    "the differential cross sections of protons and neutrons were presented .",
    "most of the neutron cross section can be considered as arising from the absorption on a quasideuteron in @xmath0he , and even in the proton cross section there are clear indications of a separation into active fast protons and slow spectators .",
    "in addition to the absence of any initial state interaction , there is another significant difference in photodisintegration compared to positive pion absorption . in pion absorption the existence of a neutron - proton pair in the isovector @xmath7 state has a negligible effect because of two suppressions of important mechanisms @xcite .",
    "firstly , due to the conservation of parity and angular momentum , the final states are spin triplets with @xmath12 and the @xmath13 admixture can never be in an @xmath14-state as in the absorption on a quasideuteron .",
    "further , @xmath15-wave pion rescattering is restricted to the weak isospin symmetric pion - nucleon amplitude in the nucleonic isospin conserving transition @xmath16 . in the photon case",
    "a similar suppression may be true for the @xmath3-dominated m1 transitions . but according to the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule e1 transitions should be as important for the singlet as for the triplet pair . the only suppression is a statistical factor of 3 since there are 3/2 @xmath1-pairs in the triplet state and only 1/2 in the singlet .",
    "so , outside the @xmath3 region also this initial state could be significant .    in the next section",
    "we discuss some details of the model , in particular the nucleon sector with a quasideuteron pair embedded in the wave function of @xmath0he .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 and section 4 gives a summary and conclusions .",
    "the simple starting point for the @xmath0he ground state is to describe its spin - isospin structure with total spin projection @xmath17 by the totally antisymmetric state @xcite @xmath18^{01 } \\times \\frac{1}{2 } \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{2 } , \\frac{1}{2}m } - \\left [ \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\times \\frac{1}{2 } \\right]^{10 } \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{1}{2 } , \\frac{1}{2}m } \\right ) |\\psi_{space}\\rangle \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] assuming a symmetric @xmath14-wave space part .",

    "this channel is of crucial importance in the @xmath3 region because of its coupling to the @xmath50 partial wave with vanishing angular momentum barrier .",
    "its magnetic dipole excitation clearly dominates deuteron photodisintegration in the resonance region .",

    "( [ eq:11 ] ) leads to @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the initial photon density matrix .",

    "expressed in terms of the deuteron and the singlet disintegration cross sections for unpolarized photons which are @xmath67 respectively , the @xmath0he disintegration cross section reads @xmath68 here it is important to note that the cross section in eq.([eq : he ] ) refers to an active particle coordinate , say the active proton .",
    "it should not be mixed up with the one - arm proton cross section of the reaction @xmath69he@xmath70 measurement .",
    "actually it is not a directly measurable quantity , but has to be extracted from a kinematically complete experiment after an assumption on the spectator momentum distribution has been made .",
    "also , analogously to the total cross section @xcite , a statistical factor 1/3 has been inserted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : he ] ) to account for the indistinguishability of the unobserved spectator .    for linearly polarized photons , eq .",

    "if , say , the @xmath7 pair contribution is much smaller than the quasideuteron contribution , it can be omitted in first order approximation .",

    "finally , it may be worth noting the reason for the preference of the cartesian component @xmath4 over the spherical one @xmath76 of the analyzing power in comparisons of the @xmath0he and deuteron reactions . in the madison convention @xcite",
    "the @xmath4 has the same expression in both cases in terms of the transition matrices , so that any differences would have a basically dynamic origin .",
    "however , the spherical quantities for the spin-@xmath77 and spin-1 particles would have normalizations differing by an additional factor of @xmath78 .      the photoabsorption mechanisms on the two - nucleon system which have been included in the present calculation are summarized in fig .  2 .",
    "the model includes the usual one - nucleon current ( n[1 ] ) ( fig .",
    "2a ) , which is given by the spin and the convection current .",
    "furthermore , the spin orbit current which gives the most important relativistic contribution is also considered . moreover ,",
    "siegert operators corresponding to the nonrelativistic one - body charge density are applied .",
    "their use allows to take into account the dominant part of the exchange current contribution to the electric multipoles in a model independent way ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction described up to now defines the so called normal part ( n ) .    in case of the quasideuteron disintegration explicit static @xmath9- as well as @xmath79-meson exchange currents ( mec ) beyond the siegert operators are included . in the nucleonic sector",
    "shown in fig .",
    "2b , c , they are consistent with respect to gauge invariance to the @xmath9- and to the dominant part of @xmath79-exchange in the obepr potential as explained in detail in ref .  @xcite . in the calculation of the @xmath60 disintegration",
    "the mec effects are incorporated via the siegert operators only .",
    "of course , direct @xmath3 excitation is the most important photoabsorption mechanism at intermediate energies . within the @xmath48-@xmath13 coupled channel approach",
    "it can be considered as a one - body contribution depicted in fig .",

    "@xcite which led to a good description of the size and the energy dependence of the total cross section for deuteron photodisintegration in the @xmath3 region .",
    "the two - body @xmath3 excitation due to the exchange current shown in fig .",
    "2e - g is of minor importance .",
    "it is worth noting that all the @xmath3-excitation mechanisms of fig .",
    "2d - g can not contribute to the break - up of the @xmath60 pair because of the isospin selection rule .",
    "since the @xmath3 excitation is always going along with an isovector transition , it can not link neutron - proton isovector states having @xmath81 , i.e. , the contributions from neutron and proton excitation cancel each other exactly .",
    "this argument is not valid any more , if the break - up of the @xmath82 pair would be considered .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to study the expected deviations of the quasifree from the free two - nucleon disintegration due to differences in the initial state wave functions as shown in fig",
    "however , it is of interest at first to make some comments about the effect of the different mechanisms shown in fig .  2 and discussed in sec .  2.3 .",
    "3 presents the accumulation of these contributions at 300 mev photon energy , just below the @xmath3-resonance energy which corresponds to @xmath83 mev .",
    "all observables are presented as a function of the proton angle in the center of momentum system of the two fast final state nucleons ( or of the photon and the initial nucleon pair ) , which is the only free variable in two - body reactions .",
    "these results are obtained using the square root of the correlation function for the initial pair wave function .",
    "the dotted curves show the purely one - nucleon current contribution and short - dashed ones the one - body part with the inclusion of two - body terms by the siegert operators . in the long - dashed curves the normal part",
    "is further supplemented with the explicit @xmath9- and @xmath79-meson exchange current effects ( mec ) shown in fig .",
    "2b , c beyond the siegert parts .",
    "the most important individual effect is the direct @xmath3 excitation shown in fig .",
    "2d , which is included in the solid curves .",

    "2e - g is added in the solid curves , but it is of minor importance .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath3 isobar has been demonstrated earlier in deuteron photodisintegration @xcite , but in the present quasideuteron case the initial state wave function is significantly more compressed to shorter distances .",
    "thus one could expect the short - range effects to be more prominent .",
    "also the nucleonic term can obtain stronger high momentum components with the compressed wave function .",
    "so for the more condensed initial wave function both the one - nucleon and mec as well as the isobar effects should be enhanced .    to investigate their interplay quantitatively and also for completeness , fig .",
    "4 presents the same observables for the true deuteron wave function and kinematics .",
    "an enhancement by a factor of three in the cross section can be attributed to the more condensed wave function .",
    "both the explicit mec and the isobar effects on the one hand and the nucleon current contribution on the other hand are increased , but in the latter the enhancement is stronger . here",
    "all changes go in the same direction to increase the total cross section , but the angular distribution remains the same at this energy .",
    "the statistical factor @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : he ] ) reduces this enhancement leaving a ratio of approximately 1.5 between the cross sections of figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "experimental evidence @xcite indicates the ratio of this magnitude .",
    "it should be emphasized that the difference of the initial wave functions is the reason for the quasifree cross section being larger than the free one , _ not _ the number of quasideuteron pairs in @xmath0he .    in the photon asymmetry @xmath85",
    ", the free deuteron gets relatively larger individual contributions than @xmath0he . in both cases the explicit mec and the isobar contribution go oppositely to the normal part resulting in virtually indistinguishable total results .",
    "the proton polarization is not changed significantly either in this energy region with the maximal @xmath3 contribution .",
    "all results for the neutron polarization were similar to those for the proton and thus will not be shown separately . only the analyzing power",
    "@xmath4 has a significantly different result at this energy , partly because of the first order interference effect from the singlet state pair wave function as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : he ] ) .    a detailed study of the contributions from the different components of the initial pair wave functions is presented in fig .  5 . all cross sections are normalized as contributions to @xmath86 in eq .",

    "the short - dashed curves show the results for the quasideuteron component alone .",
    "large parts of the amplitudes arise from its @xmath36-state .",
    "its omission leads to qualitative changes in the nucleonic spin observables as seen in the long - dashed curves .",
    "this can be expected because the nucleon spin orientation is totally different in the @xmath36-state than in the @xmath14-state .",
    "the separate @xmath7 contribution ( also in this case the spin observables are scaled with the corresponding cross section ) is also qualitatively different from the quasideuteron , but its weight is overall too small to cause any significant changes in the total observables except in @xmath4 ( solid vs.  short - dashed curves ) . in the reaction products this initial configuration is , of course , indistinguishable .",
    "however , with different multipoles ( notably e2 ) it can be seen separately for example in the quasifree disintegration of the diproton in @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath4 is not existing in case of the @xmath60 disintegration .",
    "6 shows the dependence on the different models for the pair wave functions at four photon energies ranging from 220 mev to 360 mev .",

    "the rate of change with energy between the different models is significant at and above the @xmath3 region .",

    "2d in the magnetic dipole transitions , while below 200 mev the electric dipole takes over .",
    "in the free reaction the @xmath3 becomes already dominant at a somewhat lower energy resulting in a slightly deeper minimum in the cross section .",
    "it can further be seen that the ratios of the multipole strengths for the quasifree and free cases remain quite well energy independent above 100 mev so that one would , indeed , expect a rather smooth energy dependence .",
    "the strongest energy dependence appears in the ratio m2@xmath87m2@xmath88 .",
    "this multipole is strongly affected by the @xmath13 admixture of the @xmath89 final state . also",
    "the strengths of all multipoles increase in going from the free to the quasifree reaction so that the qualitative similarity of the observables is understandable as far as the quasideuteron absorption is concerned . however , because of the different quantum numbers , obviously there must be more changes in the absorption on the @xmath7 pairs . as discussed in sect .",
    "2.3 , in that case the @xmath3 isobar can not contribute directly , and in the corresponding curves of fig .",
    "7b its explicit contribution to the amplitudes has been left out also in the `` free deuteron '' comparison .",
    "however , the @xmath90 component is retained in the calculation of the wave functions . without the isobar contribution the m1 multipole is drastically suppressed and e1 is far more prominent than in the quasideuteron and dominates the process now up to 300 mev . the `` free '' reaction without the @xmath3 would be completely dominated by e1 .",
    "also the energy dependence of the relative multipole strengths is now quite different , apparently causing the stronger energy dependence observed above in the analyzing power @xmath4 , where the @xmath7 pair amplitude appears in first order .",
    "it is also of interest to point out a prominent feature in the e2 multipole transition in the @xmath7 pair case .",
    "the dip around 300 mev is due to the renormalizing effect of the strong @xmath91 component on the @xmath92 final state wave function , i.e. , part of the two - baryon wave function , i.e. , the @xmath90 component , is not directly contributing to the reaction .",
    "the dotted curve shows the e2 multipole contribution calculation using the two - nucleon wave function without the coupling to the isobar configurations . to our knowledge",
    "such a strong feedback from an isobar admixture on the _ nucleonic _ part of the wave function has not been observed elsewhere",
    ". the unique selectivity of the isospin structure is responsible for the large reduction by about a factor of two in the e2 contribution to the total cross section .",
    "it remains to check whether it can be observed in two - body photoabsorption on the @xmath93 pair in @xmath0he , where the e2 multipole should be far more important @xcite .    finally , fig .",
    "8 shows a comparison to the recent experimental results of the tagx collaboration @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the total cross section is quite reasonable for both models of the pair wave functions . for comparison ,",
    "the dotted curve shows the free deuteron result without the factor 1/2 used in fig .",
    "the energy dependence below 200@xmath51mev is not well reproduced in any of the models .",
    "it is possible that at low momentum transfers also the spectator with its fermi motion can contribute .",
    "also in the data the @xmath3 peak is somewhat shifted towards lower energies as compared to the free deuteron case and the present @xmath0he calculations .",
    "the earlier data both in this energy region @xcite and below @xcite would allow a somewhat higher cross section than ref.@xcite .",
    "we have studied photodisintegration of @xmath0he in a quasideuteron model where the photon is absorbed at a correlated @xmath1 pair while the third nucleon merely acts as a spectator .",
    "in addition to a bound quasideuteron , we have also considered the contribution of a bound @xmath60 pair . the final @xmath1 pair interaction is completely included as well as mec and @xmath3 excitation . for the initial pair correlation function",
    "several models have been used .",
    "the compression of the @xmath1 correlation wave function compared to the free deuteron case enhances both short - range mec and @xmath3 effects and the one - body contribution as well .",
    "this nearly triples the cross section .",
    "however , the quasideuteron cross section becomes reduced by a statistical factor 1/2 leading to an overall enhancement by about 1.5 as compared with the free reaction .",
    "also in the relative spin observables and angular distributions there are significant changes both well below and above the @xmath3-resonance region . around the resonance ,",
    "the changes in the nucleonic and meson currents on one hand and in the isobar current on the other hand act in opposite directions and thus cancel each other to some extent in the relative quantities so that the @xmath0he results are rather similar to the free deuteron case .",
    "this insensitivity on the initial pair wave function suggests that in experiments trying to use two - body reactions to investigate these wave functions , the @xmath3 region is not a good choice .",
    "the same conclusion has also been reached in corresponding pion absorption studies @xcite where a systematic energy dependence of the change was seen .",
    "the sensitivity is far greater outside this energy region , and significant effects can be expected there .    in the present calculation",
    "the quasideuteron disintegration was by far the dominant contribution to the observables up to the @xmath3 region , while the @xmath7 initial configuration appeared to be significant only through the first order interference term in the analyzing power @xmath4 .",
    "however , well above this energy the @xmath3 isobar loses its prominence and also the purely nucleonic current from the @xmath7 pair gains importance .",
    "so higher energies are more sensitive to this component .",
    "there one could also expect a rising importance of the excitation of the roper resonance in the magnetic dipole transitions to the @xmath94 waves .    for the @xmath1 final states",
    "both the triplet and singlet initial configurations add coherently .",
    "however , the singlet pair could be separately studied in diproton photodisintegration by mainly the @xmath95 multipole transition @xcite .",
    "any of these two - body break - up studies may be within present experimental possibilities , e.g. , legs @xcite or tagx @xcite .",
    "one advantage of these two - body photoabsorption processes is that just one or two quantum states can be singled out in the initial states",
    ". it would also be interesting if bremsstrahlung experiments could be performed with the relative final state nucleon energy constrained so low that only the @xmath14-wave would be sufficient for its description similarly to the present pion production experiments @xcite .",
    "in this kind of simplified situation one could expect clean signals of different multipoles and exchange currents to be seen and distinguished .",
