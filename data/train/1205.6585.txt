    "the nature of light has always intrigued mankind and its study has nowadays culminated in the field of quantum optics investigating matter - field interaction @xcite . with the first measurement of an intensity - intensity correlation function by hanbury brown and twiss @xcite and the theoretical basis for the characterization of light by glauber @xcite , scientists have efficient tools in their hands to probe light fields for quantum signatures @xcite . in the last few decades ,",
    "the interest in non - classical light has grown significantly with the advent of quantum computation and information science @xcite .",
    "entangled photon pairs turn out to be indispensable for many quantum protocols @xcite and quantum algorithms @xcite . currently , there are a series of experimental techniques available to produce entangled photons such as parametric down conversion @xcite , four - wave mixing @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite or cavity qed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an atomic memory for correlated photon states has been realized experimentally , playing an essential role for quantum communication over long distances @xcite .",
    "recently , a heralded entanglement source of great practical importance has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "in addition , theoretical considerations have predicted the generation of a correlated photon pair in the x - ray regime from strongly driven atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "very recently , a communication network for quantum information processing has been proposed @xcite , which consists of numerous different nodes and channels . since such different nodes may have different characteristic frequencies , there is great interest in investigating non - classical pairs of photons of different frequencies @xcite . as an important milestone in this direction , entangled photons of different but close frequencies limited to the microwave or optical ranges",
    "have been generated and detected experimentally @xcite .",
    "based on this background , we investigate here a two - level system with broken inversion symmetry which is driven by an off - resonant laser field . by means of adjusting the laser frequency @xmath0",
    ", one can spontaneously generate a photon at an approximate frequency @xmath1 and a subsequent photon with transition frequency @xmath2 . with the parameters of e.g. gamma globulin macromolecules",
    ", those frequencies can be in the thz- and optical regimes , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] .",
    "we find that this photon - pair of different frequencies is both of non - classical character and entangled because it violates a cauchy - schwarz inequality .",
    "the advantage of our scheme lies in the fact that the frequency of the longer wavelength photon can be manipulated by an appropriate selected detuning .",
    "this is quite useful in driving a quantum network composed of different nodes of various frequencies including quantum wells or dots of thz transition frequencies .",
    "furthermore , the high flexibility distinguishes our model from a cascade three - level system or other down conversion processes .",
    "in particular , we consider a two - level system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : summary ] ) with the transition frequency @xmath3 described by the orthonormal ground state @xmath4 and excited state @xmath5 with broken inversion symmetry , meaning that the diagonal parts of the dipole operator satisfy the following condition : @xmath6 , where we define @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "the system is driven by a classical off - resonant laser field given by a linearly polarized monochromatic plane - wave field in the dipole approximation @xmath9 with laser frequency @xmath10 and amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "the sample is surrounded by a quantized environment that accounts for the processes of spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath12 describing the system takes into account the energy of the environment @xmath13 and of the two - level system @xmath14 , the interaction - energy between the laser and the two - level system @xmath15 and the interaction - energy between the environment and the two - level system @xmath16 : @xmath17 , or @xmath18 where we define the rabi frequency @xmath19 , and @xmath20 leads to broken inversion symmetry @xcite . here",
    ", we have introduced the usual atomic operators @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 denote the creation and annihilation electromagnetic field operators of the @xmath26-th mode of frequency @xmath27 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the photon polarization vector , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the electromagnetic field quantization volume . the electromagnetic atom - field interaction is given in the usual dipole - approximation .",
    "we stress the fact that we do not work in the rotating wave approximation , but rather choose a perturbative approach to account for non - linear effects . for this purpose",
    ", we first perform a unitary transformation on @xmath12 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 which may be separated ( @xmath35 ) into a time - independent part @xmath36 and a time - dependent part containing fast oscillating terms @xmath37 the time - dependent part can be regarded as a perturbation to the time - independent part and we can thus apply the second - order perturbation theory @xcite , since @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath41 our final hamiltonian @xmath42 acquires the shape @xmath43 where we keep the slowlyest oscillating time - dependent terms only .",
    "we notice that the time - dependent terms are proportional to @xmath44 and are thus important for the description of a system with broken inversion symmetry .",
    "the ratios @xmath45 and @xmath46 are small for optical frequencies @xmath0 such that higher orders are negligible in the hamiltonian .",
    "our perturbative approach also reveals an effect of strong driving fields - the bloch - siegert shift @xmath47 @xcite of the upper state of the two - level system , see fig .",

    "( [ eqn : finalhamiltonian ] ) and the heisenberg picture .",
    "we assume that the matter - field interaction is weak in the sense that an emitted photon does not react back on the atom and use the well - known born - markov approximation .",

    ". first , we insert @xmath54 in the heisenberg equation and obtain the general solution for the linear inhomogeneous differential equation of first order .",
    "then we consider the leading order in the coupling and neglect the lamb - shift , so that the creation operator acquires the shape @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "we notice that for the annihilation operator @xmath25 , we only have to take the h.c . of the above formula . if we further define the different decay rates of the system    [ eqn : decayrates ] @xmath57    and insert eq .",

    "the third term corresponds to the emission at frequency @xmath60 preceded by an excitation of the two - level system . with the used parameters , later on",
    ", it has thz - frequency while the main resonance is optical .",
    "the fourth term accounts for a spontaneous emission at resonance preceded by an excitation ( off - resonant as always ) .",
    "the last term contributes to the dephasing of the system .",
    "we are interested in correlations between the processes of the first and third summands that are illustrated in fig .",

    "now , we turn to the plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : correl](a ) of the second - order correlation function @xmath82 as a function of the rabi frequency @xmath79 describing the probability of the emission of a thz - photon and the subsequent emission of an optical photon .",
    "we observe a strong correlation which decreases with rising rabi frequency . to induce the emission of a thz - photon , the system has to be excited from the ground state to the upper state , where it may spontaneously emit an optical photon .",
    "thus , at low rabi frequencies , the emission of an optical photon is almost always preceded by the emission of a thz - photon .",
    "this explains the high degree of correlation of the photon pair .",
    "as @xmath79 increases , there is a non - vanishing probability to find the system in the excited state and an optical emission that is not preceded by a thz - photon is possible .",

    "[ fig : correl](a , b ) , we notice nonvanishing cross - correlations violating eq .",

    "thus , we are dealing with a non - classical pair of correlated and entangled photons .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the interaction of a two - level system with broken inversion symmetry and an off - resonant laser field . using the parameters of e.g. gamma globulin macromolecules or certain quantum dots , we have found the possibility to generate a long wavelength photon in the thz - regime followed by a photon in the optical frequency range .",
    "furthermore , we have observed a high degree of correlation between these photons and even a violation of a cauchy - schwarz inequality .",
    "this proves the non - classical character and entanglement of the photon pair . in the emerging field of quantum information science ,",
    "non - classical correlated or even entangled photon pairs of different frequencies are of great interest , finding applications in the realization of a quantum network .",
