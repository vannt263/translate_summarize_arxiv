    "theoretical analysis of quantum systems and their time evolution often leads to necessity of solving the corresponding partial differential equations with time - dependent hamiltonians . for the typical problem ,",
    "when the corresponding closed - form solution is unknown , a direct numerical calculation could be an efficient tool for obtaining the solution approximation with a reasonable ( and sometimes controlled ) accuracy level .",
    "the main aim of our manuscript is to develop a general way of the numerical implementation with controlled accuracy based on single - step finite - order propagators .",
    "such numerical schemes represent a step - by - step repetition procedure for a number of steps corresponding to some certain time intervals . at each step , a new solution approximation is calculated , based on the previous one ( or initial condition ) , and a certain operator : single - step propagator .",
    "a derivation of the single - step propagators is usually based on a power series expansion of the corresponding solution approximation obtained from a perturbation theory or its analogues ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the particular propagators and the corresponding implementations further could be modified in a variety of ways , in order to increase the numerical efficiency for a certain problem .",
    "for example , for solving a time - dependent scredinger equation ( tdse ) one of the most popular and well - known method is an _ exponential split - operator technique _",
    "@xcite , which correspond to a second - order solution approximation in the case of separable hamiltonians .",
    "other improvements could be achieved by using special expansions and specific references for the general solution approximation ( for example , _ harmonic - oscillator reference propagator _",
    "however , the majority of these methods could not be straightforwardly adapted and efficiently implemented for the most general statement which includes arbitrary hamiltonian structures and interaction potentials in the corresponding equations .",
    "in this manuscript we propose and develop a numerical approach which is based on general single - step propagators .",
    "such propagators allow to calculate a time evolution in the case of a most general statement : for arbitrary hamiltonian structures and interaction potentials , and with any prescribed accuracy level .",
    "the derivation of the general propagator is based on the exact solution from cyclic operator decomposition ( cod ) @xcite .",
    "this solution is used for the obtaining of the @xmath0-order solution approximation for a finite time interval in a closed - form . final expression for",
    "the propagator represents the optimization of the corresponding approximation for the efficient numerical implementation .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction in sec.i , we consider the exact solution , finite - order approximations and the corresponding propagators in sec.ii . in sec.iii",
    "we derive the general @xmath0-order single - step propagator .",
    "next , in sec.iv we consider several particular examples and corresponding optimizations for the _ first- _ , _",
    "second- _ , and _ third - order _ propagators .",
    "in sec.v we apply the propagators technique for the calculation in the case of non - separable hamiltonian : namely , the interaction of the electron in focused electromagnetic field with vortex electric field component .",
    "sec.vi is devoted to conclusions .",
    "a time evolution of a quantum system could be described by the wave function which is a solution of the corresponding time - dependent partial differential equation @xcite . in a general way",
    "such equation could be written as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a hamiltonian including all the interactions , and @xmath3 is an unknown wave function , which describes in some certain representation the time evolution of a quantum system . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 correspond to the canonical coordinates and momenta with the following commutation relations : @xmath6=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}$ ] . such formulation for some specific cases of the hamiltonian definition and",
    "the corresponding wave function representation could lead , for example , to tdse , pauli or dirac equations . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we will further omit the writing of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependence in the corresponding operators and functions .    in the case of the initial value problem ( or cauchy problem ) , the unknown solution @xmath7 is a result of the time evolution of the given initial condition @xmath8 under the action of the hamiltonian .",
    "exact solution of the problem could be written in terms of exact propagator @xmath9 for the finite time interval :    @xmath10    since the eq.([qe1 ] ) is a linear equation , the solution and the corresponding exact propagator could be obtained by using the theory of cyclic operator decomposition ( cod ) . in the case of the initial value problem , the generating function could be chosen as the initial condition @xmath8 , and the corresponding cyclic operators depend on hamiltonian operator @xmath11 and time as follows ( see @xcite for full details ) :    @xmath12\\psi(t_{0 } ) \\,\\ , ,   & & & & & & & & & & \\\\ & \\text{where:}\\\\ & \\hat{v}\\phi(t)=\\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\hat{h}(t)\\phi(t)\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\forall{\\phi(t)},\\\\ & \\hat{g}^{-1}\\varphi(t ) = \\int\\limits_{t_{0}}^{t}\\varphi(\\tau)d\\tau\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\forall{\\varphi(t)}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the convergence of such or similar series is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "note , that the correctness of the solution eq.([qe3 ] ) could be checked by the direct substitution in eq.([qe1 ] ) .",
    "the solution eq.([qe3 ] ) could be useful for a theoretical analysis , but it is not always convenient for the direct calculations because of the infinite series and @xmath13 operator .",
    "therefore , various approximations of this solution which are applicable for the efficient numerical calculations , should be considered and analyzed .    for the efficient numerical calculation in the case of relatively small time step @xmath14",
    "the finite - order propagator technique could be used .",
    "the order of propagator corresponds to the order of approximation of the exact solution , and it is equal to the highest power of @xmath15 in the series expansion of the operator . in this case",
    "the approximation is following :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the @xmath0-order propagator , and the accuracy level is determined by the absolute error , which is not more than order of @xmath18 .",
    "so , the goal of our manuscript is to obtain such @xmath0-order propagator , which could be useful for the efficient numerical implementation , without any specific restrictions for the hamiltonian form , dimensionality and type of interactions .",
    "since a time origin could be chosen arbitrary , below we assume for brevity : @xmath19 , @xmath20 .    ",
    "for the numerical calculation based on single - step propagators technique it is necessary to obtain first the closed - form finite - order approximation of the corresponding exact solution .",
    "this means , that we need to take into account only finite number of terms from the eq.([qe3 ] ) and obtain appropriate approximation for the @xmath13 operator . for this",
    "we firstly consider the following rule of integration :    @xmath21 - \\int\\limits_{0}^{x}yf'(y)dy.\\ ] ]    the last integral in the eq.([qe5 ] ) could be again transform in the same way .",
    "the sequential repetition gives us :    @xmath22 + ( -1)^{n}\\int\\limits_{0}^{x}f^{(n)}(y)\\,\\frac{y^{n}}{n!}\\,dy\\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the corresponding @xmath24-th derivative .",
    "the expression is correct only in the case when the corresponding series is exist , for example if we work with analytical functions from a class @xmath25 . in the case when we work with smooth functions ( class @xmath26 ) , which satisfy the condition : @xmath27 } , \\forall{n}\\geq{0}$ ] , the eq.([qe6 ] ) could be useful for the obtaining an arbitrary finite - order approximation of the solution eq.([qe3 ] ) with any prescribed accuracy .    thus , from the eq.([qe3 ] ) , eq.([qe6 ] ) and under necessary conditions for the convergence and accuracy , we could conclude the following two points .",
    "first , for the derivation of the @xmath0-order propagator it is sufficient to take into account only first @xmath28 terms in the corresponding series in eq.([qe3 ] ) .",
    "second , the @xmath29-order approximation @xmath30 of the @xmath13 operator could be expressed as a series , as follows :    @xmath31 = \\big [ \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{r}(-1)^{k+1}\\frac{t^{k}}{k!}\\hat{g}^{k-1 } \\big]\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 , ( @xmath33 ) is a _",
    "left inverse operator _ for the operator @xmath13 :    @xmath34    note , that on the contrary to the @xmath13 operator , the @xmath35 is equal to elementary operation : derivation , which could be calculated in closed - form for a given closed - form function .    for the derivation of the @xmath0-order approximation of the eq.([qe3 ] )",
    "it is necessary to use different @xmath29-order approximations ( @xmath36 ) of the operator @xmath13 in each corresponding therm in the series . according to eqs.([qe3 ] , [ qe7 ] )",
    "we could write :    @xmath37_{n } = \\prod\\limits_{p=1}^{m } \\left(\\hat{g}^{-1}_{r(n , p)}\\hat{v}\\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 , and we use standard _ left - to - right _ order of operator multiplication : @xmath39 .",
    "finally , we obtain the closed - form expression for the @xmath0-order propagator :    @xmath40\\hat{v } \\bigg\\}\\;.\\ ] ]    this expression includes all the necessary therms up to @xmath0-th order , and consists of the finite number of elementary operations ( we suppose that the hamiltonian includes only elementary operations ) .    ",
    "in this section we consider some of the examples of the finite - order propagators , based on eq.([qe10 ] ) .",
    "let us start from the :    @xmath41    this expression could be used only for very approximate estimations , but not generally convenient for the numerical implementations due to the low accuracy ; the error in each step is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "more interesting case is the :    @xmath43    this expression could be optimized for the different numerical implementations .",
    "let us assume a case , when the hamiltonian could be expressed as a following power series :    @xmath44    where the definition of @xmath45 for arbitrary time - independent function @xmath46 is following : @xmath47_{t=0}\\,$ ] .",
    "this gives us an opportunity to express the operator @xmath48 as follows :    @xmath49    by substituting eq.([qe13 ] ) and eq.([qe14 ] ) in eq.([qe12 ] ) , and taking in to account only therms up to second order , we could obtain :    @xmath50    now we can introduce a new operator @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we can write :    @xmath52    the last expression for the second order propagator could be further transformed in different ways .",
    "for example , we could write an operator - exponent form of eq.([qe16 ] ) by taking in to account only therms up to second order :    @xmath53\\,.\\ ] ]    this is a key expression for the _ exponential split - operator technique_. however , it could be useful only in the case of separable hamiltonians .",
    "it means that the given operator exponent need to be expressed as a product of some specific operator exponents which could be efficiently calculated .",
    "this is quite common for the case of tdse with some simple electromagnetic interactions under so - called dipole approximation ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , there are some cases when the corresponding operator exponent could not be expressed as a suitable multiplication and therefore can not be efficiently calculated . in this case , it is reasonable to use numerical schemes with a direct calculations of @xmath54 operator .",
    "for example , the optimization of eq.([qe16 ] ) in this way could be the following :    @xmath55    such multiplication propagator structure could minimize the _ ram _ operations with @xmath56-function data in various numerical implementations .",
    "finally , we obtain the expression for the based on eq.([qe10 ] ) :    @xmath57_{(m=1 ) } \\\\ & + \\big [ \\frac{t^{2}}{2(i\\hbar)^{2}}\\hat{h}^{2}(t ) - \\frac{t^{3}}{3(i\\hbar)^{2}}\\hat{h}(t)\\hat{h}'(t ) - \\frac{t^{3}}{6(i\\hbar)^{2}}\\hat{h}'(t)\\hat{h}(t ) \\big]_{(m=2 ) } \\\\ & + \\big [ \\frac{t^{3}}{6(i\\hbar)^{3}}\\hat{h}^{3}(t ) \\big]_{(m=3)}\\ , . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , the @xmath58-number points to the third - order approximation of the corresponding @xmath59-power therm in eq.([qe3 ] ) .",
    "in this section we apply the proposed propagator technique to the calculation of the specific physical problem : propagation of an electron in focused electromagnetic field with vortex electric field component .",
    "the main reason of such study is to demonstrate an applicability of our approach for the calculation of time evolution in the case of non - separable hamiltonian .",
    "we start with the description of such fields , called _",
    "m_-dipole pulses , which correspond to the exact closed - form solution of maxwell s equations in vacuum and can be generated experimentally , see @xcite for full details .",
    "the expressions for the electric @xmath60 and magnetic @xmath61 fields in the most general case of _ m_-dipole pulse are the following :    @xmath62    where @xmath29 is the distance from origin to the point of observation , @xmath63 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath64 is an arbitrary smooth vector function called virtual dipole moment , and the dot symbol above vectors or functions denotes the time partial derivative @xmath65 . after the elementary vector operations , see also @xcite , we can obtain :    @xmath66\\,,\\\\      \\vec{h}&=\\;\\vec{n}\\times\\left[\\vec{n}\\times\\frac{1}{c^{2}r}\\ddot{\\vec{d}}_{-}(t , r)\\right]+\\frac{1}{cr^{2}}\\left[3\\vec{n}\\bigr(\\vec{n}\\cdot\\dot{\\vec{d}}_{+}(t , r)\\bigr)-\\dot{\\vec{d}}_{+}(t , r)\\right]+\\frac{1}{r^{3}}\\left[3\\vec{n}\\bigr(\\vec{n}\\cdot{\\vec{d}}_{-}(t , r)\\bigr)-{\\vec{d}}_{-}(t , r)\\right]\\,,\\\\ \\vec{a}&=\\,-\\vec{n}\\times\\left[\\frac{1}{cr}\\dot{\\vec{d}}_{+}(t , r)+\\frac{1}{r^{2}}{\\vec{d}}_{-}(t , r)\\right]\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 is a normal vector , and @xmath68 .",
    "for the calculations below we consider a simple particular case of _ m_-dipole pulse which corresponds to : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a unit vector along @xmath71 axis , @xmath72 is a characteristic frequency of the radiation , and @xmath73 is a constant which could be expressed as a function of average power of incoming radiation ( @xmath74 ) , namely @xmath75 .",
    "the vortex structure of the electric field is demonstrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "next we consider the schroedinger equation for a non - relativistic electron propagation in _ m_-dipole pulse .",
