    "one common feature of these dynamical control approaches is that almost all the theories are defined in a perturbative manner . despite the progress made in theoretical studies and experimental realizations ,",
    "the perturbation theories still lack a satisfactory understanding of their validity and applicability , especially the divergence issue due to the onset of a possible phase transition .",
    "recently , a careful examination of the dynamical decoupling or bang - bang control has led to new breakthroughs achieved through introducing a non - perturbative dynamical decoupling scheme based on exact stochastic master equations in bosonic baths @xcite . by using this scheme",
    ", we showed that there is a threshold and a large pulse parameter region where the effective dynamical control can be implemented , in contrast to the perturbative decoupling schemes where the permissible parameters converge to a point or form a very small subset in the large parameter region admitted by our non - perturbative approach .",
    "our non - perturbative approach has shown impressive flexibility in implementing the dynamical control scheme in experimentation .",
    "this paper uses a spin chain model to explore the non - perturbative dynamical decoupling regime .",
    "our results demonstrate , through new type of environment and new numerical methods , several universal features of the non - perturbative dynamical decoupling emerge .",
    "more specifically , we show that there is a threshold and a large pulse parameter region where the effective dynamical control can be implemented .",
    "we model the first spin in an @xmath0-type model as our system of interest and the rest as our environment .",
    "the bath spectral density is chosen as a complicated function indicating that the ratios between two arbitrary levels are normally not rational numbers .",
    "we have derived an exact `` master equation '' for our spin system .",
    "it should be noted that for the spin environment , the environmental correlation function is very different from that for a bosonic model .",
    "however , our results obtained from this particular @xmath0-type model are expected to be applicable to other spin - environment models .",
    "our numerical calculations show that effective control can be made in many different ways either through a multiple pulse sequence , as in the case of bang - bang control , or just a single pulse applied within the bath memory time .",
    "the effectiveness of the dynamical control is not sensitive to the size of spin chain , an observation that showcases the universality of our findings .",
    "for the spin chain model , we have shown that there is an upper - bound for pulse strength in non - perturbative regimes when the pulse duration is sufficiently large , which is rather counter - intuitive from the point of view of the strong fast pulse control ( bang - bang ) .",
    "we also consider the time - independent randomness for coupling constants and site energies of the @xmath0-type spin chain .",
    "we show that our results and conclusion are robust to the random couplings and site energies even in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "finally , we consider the time - dependent random noise , which may simulate the noisy effects due to additional environmental variables .",
    "we show that the quality of dynamical control in the non - perturbative regime is also robust to the influence of the time - dependent noise .",

    "first , for the free evolution , while fidelity is not good as expected , clearly the fidelity shows significant oscillation for odd - even numbers of sites , whose magnitude decreases with @xmath20 . this is a typical finite - size effect .",
    "however , the quality of the non - perturbative dynamical decoupling , in the non - perturbative control pulse region with @xmath59 , does not depend on the chain length @xmath20 , as shown clearly in the figure .",
    "the fidelity is close to @xmath60 for all the total numbers of spins @xmath20 .",

    "the above analysis is for the case with a fixed time @xmath58 .",
    "now we discuss the time evolution of the fidelity .",
    "[ fig:3 ] plots the fidelity versus time @xmath62 .",
    "we compare the five cases : free evolution , and controlled evolution under the one of the following four conditions : ( 1 ) constant coupling @xmath24 , ( 2 ) band broadening , ( 3 ) randomness coupling @xmath63rand@xmath64 and ( 4 ) stochastic coupling @xmath65rand@xmath64 . here",
    "the band broadening refers to the uncorrelated random potentials , which is defined by @xmath66rand@xmath64 ( @xmath67 in the figure ) and generated in the process of physical fabrication .",

    "rand@xmath64 denotes a stochastic number uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath70 .",
    "it is noticeable that the dynamical control quality , characterized by the fidelity , does not change significantly with these two types of random distributions , even in the long - time limit , which indicates that our non - perturbative dynamical decoupling control is robust against the defect or frustration in experimental fabrication of the spin systems .",
    "once the spin - chain is generated , it does not change with time .",
    "however , it is important to consider a time - dependent random noise due to an external agent ( or environment ) .",
    "equally interesting , our numerical scheme allows us to model the noise as the perturbation by @xmath71rand@xmath64 ( @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) , which changes randomly before each pulse period , i.e. the random number @xmath71rand@xmath64 is constant within one period @xmath30 but varies for different periods .",

    "strong and fast pulses suppress the decay rate and effectively prolong the lifetime of the correlation function .",
    "this is one important mechanism underlying the dynamical decoupling control ( see , e. g. , @xcite and references therein ) . on the contrary , our valid parameter region may allow very wide and slow pulses , e.g. @xmath114 ( almost the lifetime ) , which is obviously beyond the known perturbative suppression mechanism .",
