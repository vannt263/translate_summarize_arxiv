    "quantum impurity models have intrigued physicists for more than half a century.@xcite in recent years , the focus has largely been on models that exhibit quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) .",
    "strictly , these are _ boundary _ qpts at which only a subset of system degrees of freedom becomes critical.@xcite boundary qpts not only serve as prototypes for the bulk qpts encountered ( or postulated to exist ) in many strongly correlated systems,@xcite but in certain cases they are amenable to controlled realization in quantum - dot setups.@xcite    of great current interest are dissipative quantum impurity models that describe a dynamical local degree of freedom coupled to one or more bosonic modes representing a frictional environment .",
    "experiments on single - molecule transistors@xcite have drawn attention to transport through nanodevices featuring electron - phonon interactions as well as local electron - electron interactions .",
    "the essential physics of these experiments seems to be captured in variants@xcite of the anderson - holstein model , which augments the anderson impurity model@xcite with a holstein coupling of the impurity occupancy to a local ( nondispersive ) phonon mode .",
    "the anderson - holstein model has been studied since the 1970s in connection with the phenomenon of mixed valence,@xcite and has also been adapted to treat the effect of negative-@xmath6 tunneling centers on superconductivity.@xcite the many theoretical approaches that have been applied to these models have yielded general agreement that phonons serve to reduce the effective coulomb repulsion between electrons in the impurity level , or even to produce an attractive net electron - electron interaction .",
    "most challenging has been the study of simultaneous strong coulomb repulsion and strong electron - phonon coupling . here , the most robust solutions have been provided by an extension of the numerical renormalization - group ( nrg ) technique , long established as a reliable tool for tackling pure - fermionic quantum impurity problems.@xcite nrg studies@xcite have shown that in the one - channel anderson - holstein model , descriptive of a single molecule coupled symmetrically to source and drain leads , increasing the phonon coupling from zero results in a smooth crossover from a conventional kondo effect , involving conduction - band screening of the impurity spin degree of freedom , to a predominantly charge kondo effect in which it is the impurity `` isospin '' or deviation from half - filling that is quenched by the conduction band . however , even for very strong electron - phonon couplings , the ground state remains a many - body kondo singlet and there is no qpt .",
    "by contrast , a two - channel model describing a single - molecular transistor with a center - of - mass vibrational mode exhibits a line of qpts manifesting the critical physics of the two - channel kondo model.@xcite    an even greater theoretical challenge is posed by quantum impurities coupled to dispersive bosons .",
    "a canonical example is the spin - boson model , @xcite which describes tunneling within a two - state system coupled to a bosonic bath .",
    "the model has many proposed applications , including frictional effects on biological and chemical reaction rates,@xcite cold atoms in a quasi - one - dimensional optical trap,@xcite a quantum dot coupled to luttinger - liquid leads,@xcite and study of entanglement between a qubit and its environment.@xcite in many cases , the dissipative bosonic bath can be described by a spectral density [ formally defined in eq .   below ]",

    "the qpt is found to be of kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "particle - hole asymmetry acts in a manner analogous to a magnetic field at a conventional ferromagnetic ordering transition , smearing the discontinuous change in the ground - state as a function of _ e - b_coupling into a smooth crossover .",

    "<S> we study the competition between kondo physics and dissipation within an anderson model of a magnetic impurity level that hybridizes with a metallic host and is also coupled , via the impurity charge , to the displacement of a bosonic bath having a spectral density proportional to @xmath0 . as the impurity - bath coupling increases from zero </S>",
    "<S> , the effective coulomb interaction between two electrons in the impurity level is progressively renormalized from its repulsive bare value until it eventually becomes attractive . for weak hybridization , this renormalization in turn produces a crossover from a conventional , spin - sector kondo effect to a charge kondo effect . at particle - hole symmetry , and for sub - ohmic bath exponents </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 , further increase in the impurity - bath coupling results in a continuous , zero - temperature transition to a broken - symmetry phase in which the ground - state impurity occupancy @xmath2 acquires an expectation value @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the response of the impurity occupancy to a locally applied electric potential features the hyperscaling of critical exponents and @xmath4 scaling that are expected at an interacting critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical values of the critical exponents suggest that the transition lies in the same universality class as that of the sub - ohmic spin - boson model . for the ohmic case @xmath5 , the transition is instead of kosterlitz - thouless type . away from particle - hole symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase transition is replaced by a smooth crossover , but signatures of the symmetric quantum critical point remain in the physical properties at elevated temperatures and/or frequencies . </S>"
