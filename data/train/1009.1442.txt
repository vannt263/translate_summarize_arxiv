    "detection of extremely - high energy ( ehe ) neutrinos with energies greater than @xmath0  gev may shed light on the long standing puzzle of the origin of ehe cosmic - rays  @xcite .",
    "several observational results have indicated that these ehe cosmic rays ( ehecrs ) are of extragalactic origin  @xcite .",
    "further elucidation of their production mechanism by ehecr observation is , however , limited because the collisions of ehecr with the cosmic microwave background photons , known as the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) mechanism  @xcite , prevent ehecrs from propagating over cosmological distances without losing a sizable fraction of their energy . on the other hand ,",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos  @xcite produced by the gzk mechanism via photo - produced @xmath7 meson decay as @xmath8 carry information on the ehecr source evolution and the maximum energy of ehecrs at their production sites  @xcite .",
    "detection of these ehe neutrinos is an experimental challenge because the very low ehe neutrino fluxes require a very large detector . the large size of the icecube neutrino observatory  @xcite , currently under construction at the geographic south pole ,",
    "will make it more effective than previous experiments in the search for these neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "interactions of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and their antiparticles are observed through the cherenkov radiation emitted by secondary particles . in the following",
    ", we do not distinguish between @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; the simulations and sensitivity calculations assume an equal mixture of particles and antiparticles .",
    "in this paper we will describe the first results of a search for signatures of cosmogenic neutrinos in the 2007 data acquired by the partially constructed icecube neutrino observatory .",
    "this analysis selects events which produce a large amount of light in the detector .",
    "based on simple criteria , such as the total number of observed cherenkov photons and the results of reconstruction algorithms , it selects candidate neutrino events .",
    "although @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 interactions look very different in icecube , the selection criteria are sensitive to all three flavors .",
    "icecube is a cubic - kilometer , high - energy cosmic neutrino telescope which is currently under construction .",
    "it uses the 2800  m thick glacial ice as a cherenkov medium .",
    "cherenkov photons emitted by relativistic charged particles , notably muons , electrons , and taus produced in charged current interactions and their secondaries , are detected by an array of photon sensors , known as digital optical modules ( doms ) @xcite .",
    "the doms deep below the ice surface are deployed along electrical cable bundles that carry power and communication between the doms and surface electronics .",
    "the cable assemblies , often called strings , are lowered into holes drilled to a depth of 2450  m. the doms , spaced at intervals of 17  m , occupy the bottom 1000  meters of each string .",
    "the strings are arranged in a hexagonal lattice pattern with a spacing of approximately 125  m. doms are also frozen into tanks located at the surface near the top of each hole .",
    "the tanks constitute an air shower array called icetop @xcite .",
    "the doms enclose a down - looking 25  cm photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) @xcite with data acquisition and calibration electronics , light emitting diodes for calibration , and also data compression , communications , and control hardware  @xcite in a 35  cm diameter pressure sphere .",
    "almost all of the pmts are run at a gain of @xmath14 ; pmt saturation effects become important at signal levels of about 5000 photoelectrons in a single dom in 50 ns . when the dom detects a photoelectron",
    ", it initiates an acquisition cycle , recording the pmt output with two waveform digitizer systems .",
    "the first system samples every 3.3 ns for 400 ns , with 14 bits of dynamic range .",
    "the second system samples every 25 ns for 6.4 @xmath15s , with 10 bits of dynamic range .",
    "the data acquisition system is designed such that the first system is sensitive to a bright photon source at close distance and the second system captures signal induced by photons emitted at large distance .",
    "this analysis uses the total number of photoelectrons detected by the pmts as a measure of the event energy . for each dom ,",
    "the charge used is the one from whichever system recorded a larger number of photoelectrons . because of the significant dom - to - dom differences in saturation behavior , the current analysis does not attempt to correct for pmt saturation .",
    "so , the signals from brightly illuminated doms are naturally truncated .",
    "this analysis uses data collected from may 2007 through april 2008 , when icecube consisted of 22 in - ice strings (; 1320 doms ) and 52 icetop tanks . in order to greatly reduce random noise from radioactivity , in ic22",
    "the doms only recorded signal waveforms when a local coincidence ( lc ) condition was satisfied , _ i.e. _ when an adjoining or next - to - nearest neighbor dom was triggered within @xmath161  @xmath15s . in 2007 , the trigger selected time periods when 8 or more doms recorded lc signals within 5 @xmath15s ; when this happened , all hits within a 20@xmath15s window were stored as an event .",
    "the average trigger rate was about 550 hz . the high - multiplicity event sample used in this analysis imposes an additional condition requiring ndom @xmath17 , where ndom is the number of hit doms in an event .",
    "the average high - multiplicity event rate was approximately 1.5 hz with a seasonal variation of 17% .",
    "a total of @xmath18 events were tagged as high - multiplicity during the effective livetime of 242.1 days ( excluding the periods of unstable operation ) .",
    "the high multiplicity cut reduces the data by a factor of @xmath19 while preserving approximately 70% of the gzk neutrinos with projected trajectories that pass within 880 m of the center of icecube . here , and below",
    ", the gzk signal rates are based on the gzk spectra and flux calculated by ref .",
    "@xcite assuming an all - proton composition with a moderately strong source evolution , @xmath20 with @xmath21 extending to @xmath22 .",
    "neutrino oscillations modify the neutrino flavor ratio over the cosmological distances they travel and the fluxes at the earth were calculated as in ref .",
    "note that the flavor ratio @xmath23 of cosmogenic neutrinos at the earth is different from 1:1:1 as primary energy spectra of @xmath10 and @xmath24 produced by the gzk mechanism are different because of a significant contribution of @xmath10 from neutron decay .",
    "this enhancement was included in the gzk neutrino flux calculations used here .",
    "ehe neutrinos were simulated with the juliet package  @xcite to generate and propagate the neutrinos through the earth .",
    "all three flavors of neutrinos were simulated with energies between @xmath25 and @xmath26 gev .",
    "the resulting secondary muons and taus produced in the neutrino interactions are propagated through the rock and ice near the icecube volume , also by juliet .",
    "hadronic and electromagnetic showers are also simulated ; all of these showers are treated as point sources , without accounting for the lpm effect .",
    "the background muon bundles from cosmic - rays in the energy range @xmath27 gev to @xmath28 gev were generated using corsika  @xcite version 6.720 with the sibyll 2.1 hadronic interaction model or with qgsjet ii , without charm production  @xcite .",
    "the uncertain prompt muon component from charm decay may contribute to the background events  @xcite .",
    "the muons were propagated through the earth using mmc  @xcite .",
    "departures of observed data distributions from those of the corsika based background events prompted us to also develop a phenomenological background model based on fits to data .",
    "emission of cherenkov photons and their propagation in the ice was simulated by the photonics package  @xcite .",
    "measurement of the absolute number of cherenkov photons is important in the ehe neutrino search as it closely relates to the energy of the high energy muons , taus or electrons produced by ehe neutrinos .",
    "therefore the detection efficiency of the doms must be understood with good precision .",
    "the primary element , the pmt , is calibrated in the laboratory using a nitrogen laser to measure the photon detection efficiency  @xcite .",
    "this bare pmt data are used in a simulation package which propagates photons inside the glass sphere and the optical gel to the photo - cathode surface .",
    "the dom simulation is followed by waveform calibration and the trigger condition is included in the simulation chain .",
    "the event signatures from @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are very different .",
    "icecube mainly detects cosmogenic neutrinos by the signals from the secondary muons and taus generated in the neutrino interaction in the rock or ice . at high energies ,",
    "these particles are seen in the detector as series of energetic cascades from radiative energy loss processes such as pair creation , bremsstrahlung , and photonuclear interactions , rather than minimum - ionizing tracks .",
    "the radiative energy losses are approximately proportional to the energy of the muon or the tau , and so is the cherenkov light yield .",
    "electron neutrinos produce electromagnetic and hadronic showers , which are relatively compact sources of cherenkov light .",
    "muon and tau neutrinos within icecube will also produce a hadronic shower from the struck nucleon , in addition to the muon or tau secondary .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the largest uncertainty in the background rate estimate arises from the fact that the parameters of the empirical model were optimized for the observed events with @xmath29 npe @xmath30 after level 2 selection . the limited statistics of this sample results in uncertainties on the parameters .",
    "the model was then extrapolated to a higher npe region for the determination of the level-4 cut .    allowing the parameters to vary within @xmath16",
    "1 @xmath31 changes the background rate by between @xmath3259% ( for the softest possible npe spectrum after the level-4 cuts ) and @xmath33 99% ( for the hardest possible npe spectrum ) .",
    "uncertainties in the detector sensitivity are incorporated by the parametrization .",
    "the difference in the background level estimated with the extrapolated corsika / iron and the empirical model can be taken to indicate the level of systematic uncertainty due to model dependence .",
    "this uncertainty is approximately @xmath1615% and can be assumed to include the possible contribution from charm decay .",
    "an uncertainty associated with the high energy hadronic interaction model is evaluated using simulated muon bundle intensity from sibyll and qgsjet ii with iron primaries and found to be @xmath16 4% , which is negligible .",
    "an additional uncertainty of @xmath117% arises from the seasonal variation of the atmospheric muon rate as the signal selection criteria are based upon the season - averaged data .",
    "the uncertainty in the relationship between measured npe and the energies of charged particles is the largest systematic error affecting the signal event rate .",
    "it is the consequence of our limited understanding of the detector sensitivity , the photon propagation in ice , and the detector response to bright signals .",
    "it is evaluated using absolutely calibrated in situ light sources and amounts to a possible overestimation of npe in simulation by 18.5% , which leads to decrease of the gzk signal rate by @xmath121% .",
    "uncertainties of the relevant particle interactions in the ehe regime also add systematics in the signal rate estimation .",
    "the expected event rate scales nearly linearly with the neutrino - nucleon inelastic cross section in the ehe range .",
    "this scaling has been confirmed by numerical studies , artificially increasing the cross section .",
    "the cross section uncertainty has been recently reduced to be around @xmath34% with the inclusion of the most recent data from hera and modern parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "another systematic error arises from the photonuclear cross section of ehe muons and taus .",
    "the present calculation used the model by bugaev and shlepin  @xcite , rewritten in ref .",
    "@xcite , that includes a relatively reliable soft nonperturbative component and a less certain hard perturbative part . ignoring the hard component in the simulation",
    "gives the most conservative estimate of the uncertainty and leads to a 10% event rate increase .",
    "the suppression of bremsstrahlung and pair production due to the lpm effect  @xcite , for the relevant electron energies of @xmath35 gev , increases the effective radiation length of the electromagnetic cascade to @xmath36  m from @xmath136  cm  @xcite .",
    "because the value is still comparable to the icecube dom separation , and the contribution from @xmath10 constitutes @xmath3720% of the total event rate in this energy range , the lpm effect has a negligible impact on the event rate .",
    "this has been confirmed by a special simulation study on @xmath10 including the lpm cascade elongation .",
    "no events are observed in the final data sample taken in 2007 with a livetime of 242.1 days when applying the final level-4 selection criteria , which is consistent with the expected number of background events of @xmath38 .",
    "we choose to present the resulting all flavor ehe neutrino upper limit in the quasi - differential form independent of the neutrino production model . assuming full mixing due to oscillations , the experimental 90% confidence level upper limit is obtained by setting 2.44 events  @xcite for an upper bound of the number of events observed with bin width of a decade of energy with condition that energy dependence of neutrino flux multiplied by the effective area behaves as @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "this limit is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] including the systematic errors .",
    "the plot indicates that the ehe neutrino search by the icecube observatory is most sensitive to the neutrinos with energies on the earth surface ranging between about @xmath40 and @xmath41 gev .",

    "i.e. _ number of neutrinos per unit energy , area , time and solid angle .",
    ", width=326 ]    the quasi - differential limit in fig .  [ fig : sensitivity ] takes into account the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the background rate stays negligible @xmath44 even including the systematic uncertainty and the resultant upper limit is unchanged .",
    "the signal rate uncertainty is strongly dominated by the uncertainty of the npe yield which influences the number of expected signal events as a function of the neutrino energy .",
    "the upper limit is calculated by reducing npe by 18.5% in the signal simulation to account for this factor .",
    "all the other sources of systematic error only slightly change the signal passing rate ; they are independent of energy .",
    "they are included in the analysis by uniformly scaling the effective area in the limit calculation .",
    "the present limit is approximately a factor of 20 - 30 higher than the intensity range expected in the gzk cosmogenic neutrino production models  @xcite , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] .",
    "the current limit for 242.1 days of observation is comparable to the auger  @xcite and hires  @xcite bounds by their multiple year operation .",
    "the present work has demonstrated that the icecube neutrino observatory is capable of searching for signatures of ehe cosmogenic neutrinos with relatively straightforward event selection methods .",
    "the model independent differential upper limit obtained with 242.1 days of observation in 2007 , with approximately one quarter of the completed detector is @xmath2 gev @xmath3 sec@xmath4 sr@xmath4 for neutrinos with an energy of @xmath42 gev .",
    "this is approximately a factor of 20 higher than the predicted gzk neutrino flux from relatively strongly evolved sources . in the future",
