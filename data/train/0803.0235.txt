    "the majority of the inhomogeneities in the chemical composition of globular cluster ( gc ) stars see e.g. @xcite appear due to primordial enrichment by hot - cno cycled material processed in stars belonging to a first stellar generation . either massive agb envelopes subject to hot bottom burning , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the envelopes of massive fastly rotating stars ( frms ) @xcite are an ideal environment to manufacture elements through nuclear reactions in which proton captures are involved . a second stellar generation would then be born from the ejecta of these stars , either directly , or diluted with pristine material .",
    "there are however problems with these scenario . for the agb progenitors ,",
    "problems concern the chemistry of the anomalous stars ( see @xcite , but consider also @xcite ) , and the requirements for the mass budget necessary to produce a second stellar generation that , today , is generally about as numerous as the first one @xcite .",
    "the frms model is somewhat less problematic concerning the constraints on the imf , but poses , in any case , severe problems for `` normal '' gcs , that show a unique metallicity for all stars ( with the notable exception of ): this model requires that the envelopes of these stars contribute to the second star formation stage , but the supernova ejecta are expelled from the clusters and do not enrich the second generation matter by heavy elements .",
    "both scenarios predict that the stars showing chemical anomalies also must have _ enhanced helium abundance_. helium and the hot  cno products in the frms come to the stellar surface by means of the chemical mixing associated with the transport of angular momentum through the stellar radiative layers , during the phase of hydrogen burning . in the case of agbs",
    ", the helium enrichment is mainly due to the second dredge up ( 2du ) which precedes the thermal pulse phase .",
    "also the third dredge up ( 3du ) contributes to helium enrichment in the envelopes , but a further observational constraint is that the sum of cno abundances remains remarkably constant in normal and anomalous stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the masses which can be responsible for the chemical enrichment must be high enough to be subject to a few episodes of the third dredge up , that brings into the envelope the products of helium burning .    a variation in helium content is immediately reflected on the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , which amplifies any evolutionary difference among the cluster stars .",
    "helium enrichment by a small factor ( up to y@xmath2 ) allowed in fact an easy interpretation of some puzzles posed by the hb ( blue tails , gaps ) @xcite .",
    "helium variations from the ms location are much harder to be detected , but the clustering of @xmath120% of  stars into a `` blue '' ms @xcite was soon interpreted as a ms having an abnormally huge helium content ( y@xmath30.40 ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to , ngc  2808 does not show a metallicity spread @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , evidence for the presence of a blue ms in this cluster has been found by @xcite , who interpreted it , again , as built up by stars having y@xmath30.40 , and were able to correlate them with the bluest side of the hb .",
    "@xcite showed that the ms of this cluster is actually made up by _ three _ separate mss , the bluest of which , including 1015% of stars , must have a helium content y@xmath4 .",
    "the presence of blue ms has not yet been found in other clusters : observationally it is a very difficult problem , and , in addition , this may be a characteristic of the most massive clusters only .",
    "huge helium overabundances are also needed to explain all the main features of the anomalous hb of the metal rich clusters ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 @xcite including : 1 ) the long extension in luminosity of the red clump ; 2 ) the fact that rr lyrs have a very long average period , which is unusual for a cluster of high metallicity ; 3 ) the extension into the blue of the hb .",
    "this analysis also requires that @xmath5% of the hb population has y@xmath60.35 .",
    "all these observations and their interpretation in terms of helium enrichment must be taken very seriously , but no chemical enrichment mechanism is able to produce the huge amount of helium required for about 15%20% of the stars in these four clusters without dramatically impacting upon the metal abundance @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the presence of this extreme population requires some very particular dynamical and chemical conditions to be understood .",
    "nevertheless , the first step is to look for progenitors which may at least provide the required high helium abundance in their ejecta .    the most massive frms may be able to eject huge quantities of helium @xcite . concerning the agb stars , @xcite pointed out that y@xmath30.40 is not predicted by agb models , and this could , in the end , rule out agb stars as progenitors of the second stellar generation .",
    "a scarne y@xmath30.29 was the maximum abundance computed from agb evolution in the models by @xcite for 5.5 , while a single value y=0.375 is quoted by @xcite for a 5  model by @xcite .",
    "ventura & f. dantona ( in preparation ) have now completed new computation of massive agbs , whose results revise upward the previous ones ( see later ) .",
    "the maximum agb mass in these recent computation is 6.3 , and the possible role of super  agb stars has not yet been considered .",
    "such models are difficult to be computed , as carbon burning in semi ",
    "degeneracy has to be followed , and the uncertainty in the mass loss rate hampers any conclusions on their final evolution , either towards electron  capture supernova ( ecsn ) or towards o  ne white dwarfs .    in the light of recent super  agb stars models described in @xcite , in this paper",
    "we discuss the possible role of these stars for the self  enrichment of gcs .",
    "we discuss both the helium abundance and the total cno abundance versus core mass which can be built up by the most recent agb and super  agb models .",
    "we find out that the matter lost by the envelopes of super  agbs may indeed be a good candidate for the high helium population of the four gcs discussed above .",
    "however , in the _ higher mass tail of the stars developing a o  ne core _ the total cno is increased by a factor @xmath7 .",
    "observations of the super he  rich stars may be able to check this result .    if all the stars in the gcs having a high  he population have standard cno , as found for all the chemically anomalous stars in many gcs , the most massive super ",
    "agbs must evolve into ecsne .",
    "this conclusion would be of further support to the idea that the presence of large population of neutron stars in gcs implies that they were born with supernova  kicks low enough not to be ejected by the cluster , as expected by the ecsn event ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "agb stars develop a degenerate carbon  oxygen core and mass loss prevents them to reach the mass limit for degenerate explosive carbon ignition . super ",
    "agbs are defined as stars which ignite carbon in conditions of semi  degeneracy , thus non explosively , but are not able to ignite hydrostatic neon burning in the resulting o  ne core .",
    "consequently , degeneracy increases in the core and these stars may undergo thermal pulses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and lose mass as `` normal '' ( but quite massive and luminous ) agb stars . depending on the competition between the mass loss rate and the core growth , they may then evolve into massive o ",
    "ne white dwarfs @xcite or as ecsn , electrons being captured first by 24  and 24  then by 20  and 20nuclei when the core mass reaches the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the 2du occurs also in super  agbs and , as in the massive agbs , it reduces the mass of the h  exhausted core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the helium abundance increases in the external hydrogen envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if mass loss is strong enough to avoid the super  agb evolving to ecsn , as soon as super  agbs evolve in the gcs , the supernova epoch is finished , and we may hypothesize that the second phase of star formation begins from the super ",
    "agb ejecta .",
    "as a function of the carbon oxygen core mass , we report in figure [ f1 ] the helium content in the agb ejecta of metallicity z=@xmath8 , for the models from 4 to 6.3  by p. ventura & f. dantona ( in preparation ) including @xmath9elements enhancement in the opacities , and core overshooting .",
    "an important difference from @xcite models is the following : in the present models , also overshooting at the bottom of the convective envelope is included , adopting the same parameter which describes core overshooting .",
    "this latter is calibrated to account for the width of the ms of intermediate mass stars .",
    "the effect of the envelope overshooting is to enhance the extent of the 2du : fixed the initial mass , the remnant core mass at the beginning of the agb evolution is then _ smaller _ , and the resulting helium content in the envelope is _ larger _ , as can be seen by comparing the values of figure [ f1 ] with table 1 in @xcite .",
    "we also plot the helium content at the 2du for the super ",
    "agb models of metallicity z=@xmath8 from 7.5  to 9.5@xcite computed without overshooting . in this case  is the c  o mass after the 2du .",
    "is indeed the important physical parameter which determines the final fate of the star .",
    "the initial mass difference between the agb models with overshooting and super  agb models without overshooting is , for the same core mass , @xmath31 . for super  agbs , we do not have the helium mass fraction of the ejecta , but these stars do not go through efficient episodes of 3du , so the plotted value is a good approximation . as we see , the super ",
    "agb models reach a helium content in the ejecta larger than the standard agbs , and well approaching the values needed to be consistent with the super  he rich stars in gcs . the new agb models and the super ",
    "agb models shown here , computed by a different program and input physics @xcite are in good agreement with each other , at the same core mass .    from figure [ f1 ] we see that indeed the super  agbs could be the progenitors of the very high helium population found in the most massive gcs . for a salpeter s initial mass function",
    ", the mass budget in the ejecta from 6.5(the minimum mass for super  agb evolution , considering models with overshooting ) to 8(see later ) is about 50% of the mass budget contained in the ejecta of normal agbs from 5to 6.5 .",
    "therefore , from the super  agbs mass budget , a 15% fraction of very high helium stars can be born , with the same mechanism which can give origin to another @xmath330% of moderately helium rich stars , as in the cluster ngc  2808 @xcite .",
    "how these stars can form directly from the super ",
    "agb ejecta , so that their helium abundance remains as large as the required y@xmath00.35 , is a different problem .",
    "figure [ f1 ] also shows the total cno enrichment , the sum of cno abundances with respect to their initial sum , in the ejecta of agbs and at the 2du for the super  agbs . the agb enrichment is larger than @xmath32 for @xmath100.9 , that is for m@xmath105 .",
    "as we have noticed , the sum of cno abundances apparently is constant ( within a factor 2 ) in gc stars . on this basis",
    ", we should conclude that stars of m@xmath115  should not contribute to the second stellar generation unless their ejecta are diluted with pristine matter , so that the constancy of cno is preserved .",
    "for the super  agbs , we also find a sharp increase of , reaching a factor 4 for the largest mass in exam .",
    "this is due to the occurrence of the so called dredge  out process in this model @xcite .",
    "the helium mass fraction and the overall cno content are the most robust predictions from these theoretical computations , due to the large uncertainties associated to both the extension of the 3du and the strength of hot bottom burning ( hbb ) within super  agb models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also comment the individual abundances providing .",
    "the cno abundances given for @xmath12are the average mass fractions of the ejecta .",
    "as hbb is very efficient , the values provide very small carbon ( @xmath13 for @xmath14-@xmath15models down to @xmath16 at @xmath17 ) , and low oxygen ( from @xmath18 at @xmath14to @xmath19 at @xmath17 ) ; nitrogen is very high , especially in the @xmath14 , where the effect of the 3du is more visible ( @xmath20 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "for the super  agbs , we consider the values at the 2du .",
    "the carbon abundance increases from @xmath21 for the @xmath22model to @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "the nitrogen is about constant ( @xmath25 ) , whereas the oxygen abundance is constant ( @xmath26 ) up to @xmath27 , and increases up to @xmath28 for the @xmath24model : this is due to the deeper sinking of the 2du when increasing the mass . in the @xmath29model , the dredge  out process rises @xmath30 to @xmath31 and @xmath32 to @xmath33",
    ". the following evolution will reduce oxygen and carbon and increase nitrogen , if hbb is efficient in these stars as it is in the massive agbs ( this depends on the convective model adopted ; see @xcite ) . as for the 3du , there are different and incomplete literature results ( see * ? ? ? * for summary ) . in any case , it can only act to increase the values of total cno abundances given in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "how many stars would be affected if all the super  agbs contribute to the second stellar generation ?",
    "if all the super  agbs contribute to the very helium rich population , the fraction of high  cno stars , assuming a salpeter s imf , would be @xmath110% !",
    "this is a small fraction of the cluster stars , if we consider that the super  he rich stars are 1520% of the total population , but spectroscopic observations of a large sample of stars could falsify this hypothesis .",
    "should the constancy of cno be observationally confirmed also for the most helium rich population showing up in the quoted 4 clusters , we will be able to conclude that the most massive super ",
    "agbs did not take part in the process of forming the second stellar generation in gcs .",
    "this may mean : 1 ) that there were reasons , independent from the super  agb evolution , by which the self  enrichment process was effective either only at earlier ages ( due to the envelopes of massive stars ) or at a later age ( during the normal , massive agb evolution ) 2 ) or that the self  enrichment was forbidden by the injection in the cluster gas of the energy due to the ecsn explosion of the stars which undergo the dredge out . although the explosion energy of such event is significantly lower than inferred for core collapse sn @xcite , it is probably more than sufficient to expel the sn ejecta from most clusters .",
    "the conclusion then would be that at least a fraction of super ",
    "agbs must evolve into ecsn , reinforcing the idea that ecsn channel for super  agb stars could occur ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the final fate as ecsn of at least a fraction of super ",
    "agbs is also required by the recent suggestion that ns in gcs should be mainly formed by the ecsn channel .    the high number of neutron stars ( ns ) in gcs , whose presence is revealed mainly by the very high number of millisecond pulsars , remains a puzzle .",
    "the massive gc 47tuc was predicted to contain more than 1000 ns ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "now this figure can perhaps be reduced to @xmath3300600 @xcite .",
    "the velocity distribution of young pulsars in the galaxy shows that , at formation , the ns receives a `` natal kick '' , most likely due to the asymmetry in the supernova ejecta @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that only up to 8% of ns can be retained in the clusters . the kick velocity distribution which they used @xcite has been recently updated by @xcite , who find a higher mean velocity and velocity dispersion . using these new data , simulations of the retention factor by @xcite",
    "show that almost no ns can be retained for an escape velocity of 40km@xmath34s@xmath35 .",
    "a natural way to solve this problem , is to hypothesize that there is a stellar population which evolves into ecsn , that probably have _ much smaller _ natal kicks @xcite , possibly proportional to their reduced explosion energy .",
