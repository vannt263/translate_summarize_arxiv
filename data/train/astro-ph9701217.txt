    "another aspect is that the explosion energies are smaller than the gravitational binding energy of the accreted hydrogen envelope .",
    "an evenly distributed explosion energy would not unbind and eject matter .",
    "it remains to be seen whether an interesting amount of matter can escape the neutron star .",
    "super - eddington x - ray bursts ( ) are the best candidates for this behavior .    a description of hot ( explosive ) hydrogen burning has been given by ( 1980 ) , ( 1981 ) , ( 1982 ) , ( 1983 ) , ( 1986 ) , ( 1994 ) , ( 1994 ) [ see also ( 1991 ) , ( 1994 ) , ( 1992 ) , and ( 1993 ) for thorne - zytkow objects , but see the recent results by ( 1996 ) which puts doubts on their existence ] .",
    "the burning is described by proton captures , @xmath22-decays , and possibly alpha - induced reactions on unstable proton - rich nuclei , usually referred to as the rp - process ( rapid proton capture process ) .",
    "cross sections can either be obtained from the best available application of present experimental knowledge , e.g. the determination of resonance properties from mirror nuclei and transfer and/or charge exchange reaction studies , or actual cross section measurements , like for @xmath23n(@xmath24o , the first reaction cross section analysed with a radioactive ion beam facility ( see 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "there exist two major motivations in nuclear astrophysics ( a ) , to understand the reaction flow to a necessary degree , in order to predict the correct energy generation required for hydrodynamic , astrophysical studies , and ( b ) , to predict a detailed isotopic composition which helps to understand the contribution of the process in question to nucleosynthesis in general .",
    "our main motivation in this paper is ( a ) , to provide a fast energy generation network as a tool for nova and x - ray burst studies .",
    "this might be underlined by the fact that novae and x - ray bursts seem not to be major contributors to nucleosynthesis due to the small ejected masses involved or the question whether gravitational binding can be overcome at all .",

    ", we have to be able to understand the main reaction fluxes . in the past we performed a series of rp - process studies ( 1986 to ar , and 1994 , extending up to kr ) .",
    "the reaction rate predictions were based on resonance and direct capture contributions for proton - rich nuclei , making use of the most recent experimental data .",
    "several ( @xmath29)-reaction rates below mass a=44 have been recalculated by ( 1995 ) in the framework of a shell model description for the level structure of the compound nucleus .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the major aspects was given by ( 1994 ) .",
    "in the following section [ reacflow ] we will present this in more detail and discuss the constraints which an approximation scheme has to fulfill in the whole range of temperatures occurring in explosive hydrogen burning environments , i.e. @xmath0@xmath1 k. the approximation scheme will be presented in section [ approxscheme ] , its application and comparison with full network calculations in section [ results ] , followed by concluding remarks in section [ conc ] .",
    "at low temperatures , the rp - process is dominated by cycles of two successive proton captures , starting out from an even - even nucleus , a @xmath22-decay , a further proton capture ( into an even-@xmath30 nucleus ) , another @xmath22-decay , and a final @xmath31-reaction close to stability ( similar to the hot cno ) .",
    "the final closing of the cycle via a @xmath31-reaction occurs because proton capture q - values increase with increasing neutron number @xmath32 in an isotopic chain for a given @xmath30 , while @xmath33-capture q - values or -thresholds show a very weak dependence on @xmath32 .",
    "thus , a cycle closure occurs at the most proton - rich compound nucleus , which has a lower alpha than proton - threshold .",
    "these are the even-@xmath30 and especially well bound `` alpha''-nuclei with isospin t@xmath34=@xmath35=0 , like @xmath36o , @xmath37ne , @xmath38 mg , @xmath39si , @xmath40s , @xmath41ar , @xmath42ca .",

    "the hydrogen burning cycles are connected at these nuclei , due to a possible competition between the @xmath2- and @xmath31-reaction .",
    "an exception to the rule is the ne isotopic chain , where the transition happens already for the compound nucleus @xmath43ne .",
    "thus , @xmath49f(@xmath50o is a possible reaction , bypassing the of(ne)-cycle .",
    "therefore , only the extended cn(o)- , the nena- , mgal- , sip- , scl - cycles etc .",
    "this is displayed in figure [ fig cycle43 ] .",
    "the progress of burning towards heavier nuclei depends on the leakage ratio @xmath51 into the next cycle , which makes a good experimental determination of these reactions important and is possible as we deal here with stable targets . on the other hand ,",
    "the excitation energies in the corresponding compound nuclei are of the order 8.512  mev and make statistical model approaches also reliable ( see e.g. the experiments by 1993 , 1994 and 1995 for @xmath46p(@xmath52 , and @xmath47cl(@xmath52 and the later discussion ) .    increasing temperatures",
    "allow to overcome coulomb barriers and extend the cycles to more proton - rich nuclei , which permit additional leakage via proton captures , competing with long @xmath53-decays .",
    "the cycles open first at the last @xmath53-decay before the @xmath31-reaction via a competing proton capture , i.e. at the even-@xmath30 t@xmath34=1/2 nuclei like @xmath44 mg , @xmath45si , @xmath46s , @xmath47ar , and @xmath48ca , excluding @xmath26o ( because @xmath36f is particle unstable ) and @xmath43ne , which is bypassed by the stronger @xmath49f(@xmath54-rate .",
    "these nuclei are only one unit away from stability and have small decay q - values and long half - lives .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure [ fig qval1 ] , which shows the possible break - out points and the q - values of the proton capture reactions . since the reaction proceeds towards the proton drip - line and into an odd - odd nucleus , the capture q - values of these @xmath2-reactions are small ( generally less than 2 mev ) .",
    "this implies a too small density of excited states for employing statistical model cross sections ( see discussion in the following paragraphs ) . at about 3@xmath5510@xmath56",
    "k essentially all such cycles are open and a complete rp - pattern of proton captures and @xmath53-decays is established , with the exception of the extended cno - cycle .",
    "the process time is determined by the sum of @xmath53-decay and proton capture time scales , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , along the rp - path , which does generally not extend more proton - rich than t@xmath34=1 for even-@xmath30 nuclei .",
    "the reaction time scales are dominated by the t@xmath34=1/2 even-@xmath30 nuclei close to stability , listed above .    at 4@xmath5510@xmath56  k",
    "the cno - cycle breaks open via @xmath26o(@xmath59ne .",
    "@xmath60o(@xmath61f can also lead to a successful break - out when followed by a proton capture and @xmath5-reaction on @xmath49ne . due to higher energies ,",
    "coulomb barriers can be more easily overcome by heavier projectiles ( like alpha captures on cno - targets ) , and proton captures can occur further away from stability .",
    "however , in all cases the decay of t@xmath34=1 even-@xmath30 nuclei ( and at high densities the competition with @xmath5-reactions ) is a prominent part of the reaction path .",
    "alpha - reactions are not important for @xmath30@xmath6220 , due to increasing coulomb barriers and decreasing q - values . for heavier nuclei beyond ca",
    ", the reaction pattern seems complicated .",
    "however , temperatures approaching @xmath63  k cause strong photodisintegrations for proton capture q - values smaller than 25@xmath64@xmath103  mev , which is comparable to q - values found for even-@xmath30 t@xmath34=1 nuclei .",
    "[ 25 - 30@xmath64@xmath65@xmath66 is a rough criterion to find out whether photodisintegrations can counterbalance capture reactions and lead to an equilibrium situation . ]",
    "thus , reactions breaking out of the cycles discussed above ( up to the proton drip line ) come into a @xmath2@xmath3-equilibrium along isotonic lines with equal @xmath32 . under such circumstances",
    "the nuclear connection boils down to the necessary knowledge of nuclear masses and @xmath53-decay half - lives , similar to the r - process experiencing an @xmath67@xmath68-equilibrium in isotopic chains ( see ; ; ) .",
    "the general situation is explained in figure [ fig netzw ] , which contains all possible reactions from the original cycles over proton captures breaking out of the cycles , the accompanying beta decays and @xmath69-reactions bridging waiting points with long decay half - lives . by comparing with figure [ fig qval1 ] , which also lists the q - values involved , figures [ fig rp_fig4a ] and [ fig rp_fig4b ]",
    "give an indication for the minimum temperatures required to permit statistical model calculations for proton and alpha - induced reactions .",
    "the reason is that a high density of compound nuclear states is necessary for statistical model calculations to become reliable .",
    "the energy of the gamow peak , where the integrand in a thermonuclear cross section integral ( cross section times boltzmann distribution ) has a maximum , increases with increasing temperature .",
    "because higher level densities are encountered at higher excitation energies corresponding to higher temperatures of the boltzmann distribution , a critical temperature exists beyond which such calculations are reliable ( for more details see 1996 ) .",
    "we can analyse the expected behavior : reactions @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 of figure [ fig netzw ] have reaction q - values less than @xmath103  mev and for conditions close to 10@xmath73  k we have 25@xmath64@xmath10@xmath66 which permits a ( @xmath52@xmath3-equilibrium .",
    "thus , although the cross sections are highly uncertain and statistical model approaches are not valid ( see figure [ fig rp_fig4a ] ) , only the q - values , i.e. masses , are needed for these nuclei . reactions @xmath74 ,",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 [ ( @xmath52 and ( @xmath54 reactions ] have q - values in excess of 5  mev and in most cases high enough level densities to ensure the usage of statistical model cross sections for the appropriate temperature regime .",
    "reaction @xmath78 , an @xmath5-reaction , provides also a sufficiently high level density to apply statistical model cross sections ( see figure [ fig rp_fig4b ] , for @xmath49ne(@xmath79 ) see ) .",
    "reaction @xmath80 is crucial for the break - out , a statistical model approach is clearly not permitted , and a ( @xmath52@xmath3-equilibrium is not valid at the lower appropriate temperatures of about 3 - 4@xmath11  k. thus , all reactions of type @xmath80 ask strongly for experimental determination , possibly with radioactive ion beams . reactions @xmath81 , @xmath82 and all other connecting @xmath53-decays are required , preferably from experiments , otherwise from theoretical qrpa predictions .",
    "[ fig rp_fig4a ]    beyond ca and ti , this scheme simplifies into one dominated by proton captures and beta - decays , with the proton captures in a ( @xmath52@xmath3-equilibrium .",
    "the proton drip line develops a zig - zag shape and can separate two even-@xmath30 proton - stable nuclei on the same isotone by an unstable odd-@xmath30 nucleus .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown that such gaps can be bridged by two - proton capture reactions , proceeding through the unstable nucleus , similar to the @xmath83-reaction passing through @xmath56be .",
    "this can extend the @xmath2@xmath3-equilibrium beyond the drip line to proton - stable `` peninsulas '' , thus avoiding long beta - decay half - lives .",
    "while alpha - induced reactions are not important for nuclei beyond ca and ti , small q - values for @xmath84 can permit @xmath85-photodisintegrations and cause a back flow , decreasing the build - up of heavy nuclei .",
    "after having analized the reaction patterns in the previous discussion , we have now to implement these findings into an approximation which can handle and describe all of the patterns .",
    "considering the hydrogen and helium abundances as slowly varying , and assuming a kind of local steady flow by requiring that all reactions entering and leaving a nucleus add up to a zero flux , we will devise a scheme which can adapt itself to the whole range of conditions of interest in hot hydrogen burning .",

    "the network must be completed with the @xmath83-reaction .",

    "the @xmath4-reactions of the for the rp - process relevant nuclei are , with the exception of @xmath192ni , @xmath193ge and @xmath190kr , considerably smaller than the typical time scales of novae and x - ray bursts .",

    "the results for small temperatures are shown in figure [ fig novae1][fig novae3 ] and those for x - ray burst conditions in figure [ fig xrayb1][fig xrayb3 ] . considering the time scales important for novae ( 1001000  s ) and x - ray bursts ( 110  s ) , we see that the approximation scheme devised in section 3 agrees always to a high degree for the astrophysical applications considered here .",
    "the overall results show only deviations smaller than 15 per cent or even less ( down to 5 per cent ) at a gain in computational speed by a factor of 15 .",
    "several calculations at intermediate temperatures and densities , i. e. @xmath199@xmath200@xmath16@xmath200@xmath17 , @xmath201@xmath200@xmath124@xmath200@xmath182 confirmed the above mentioned efficiency and accuracy of the approximation scheme .",

    "no significant change in computational speed was observed .",
    "the differences at time scales smaller than @xmath145=@xmath207  s are due to the very fast reaction flows within the proton capture reaction chains : they occur in full scale network calculations until equilibrium is reached according to equation ( [ eq einlpa1c ] ) .",

    "the main motivation for the present investigation was to find a fast and efficient approximation scheme which permits to predict the energy generation in explosive hydrogen burning for a large range of conditions , i.e. temperatures @xmath209@xmath200@xmath124@xmath200@xmath210 and densities @xmath211  g  @xmath19@xmath200@xmath16@xmath212  g  @xmath19 ) respectively , for applications in hydro calculations which can not afford full nuclear network .",
    "this goal has been achieved .",
    "the energy generation of full network calculations ( 150 nuclei ) could be reproduced with a high accuracy , resulting in deviations of 5 to a maximum of 15 per cent while gaining a factor of about 15 in computational speed .",
    "the additional advantage of this method is that it also permits to predict isotopic abundances with a similar accuracy and can thus even replace full network calculations for this purpose ( see figure [ fig ar33615 ] ) .",
    "we were also able to determine key nuclear properties , which directly enter the precision of calculations for explosive hydrogen burning , its energy generation and abundance determination .",
    "we have identified the even-@xmath30 t@xmath34=1/2 nuclei like @xmath44 mg , @xmath45si , @xmath46s , @xmath47ar and @xmath48ca , as essential targets for proton captures which are in competition with @xmath53-decays . as their small reaction q - values ( less than 2  mev ) do not permit the application of statistical model cross sections , they have to be determined experimentally .",
    "thus , these results are an ideal guidance for future experimental investigations with radioactive ion beams",
    ". nuclei closer to stability permit the application of statistical model cross sections .",
    "nuclei more proton - rich than @xmath213=-1 are only populated for conditions when a @xmath2@xmath3-equilibrium is established .",
    "thus , only their masses , spins and half - lives enter the calculation .",
    "connecting @xmath5-reactions have high enough q - values , even close to the drip - line , that the level densities are sufficient for statistical model cross sections ( this is true at least up to ca and ti , where alpha - induced reactions can play an important role ) .",
    "therefore , the remaining experimental properties which should be determined and enter the calculations in a crucial way are @xmath22-decay half - lives and nuclear masses . the latter control the abundances in a @xmath2@xmath3-equilibrium . beyond se ,",
    "the details of the proton drip - line are actually not that well known yet , but can influence the endpoint of the rp - process .",
    "first calculations which include 2p - capture reactions ( schatz et al .",
    "1996 ) indicate that it seems possible to produce nuclei with a=90 - 100 in the rp - process under x - ray burst conditions , depending on the choice of mass formulae and half - life predictions ( similar to r - process studies ) . especially a region of strong deformation and small @xmath33-capture q - values around @xmath109=80 seems to be predicted with large variations among different mass models , and the even - even @xmath32=@xmath30 nuclei between a=68 and 100 play a dominant role .",

    "<S> it is based on the concept of slowly varying hydrogen and helium abundances and assumes a kind of local steady flow by requiring that all reactions entering and leaving a nucleus add up to a zero flux . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme can adapt itself automatically and covers situations at low temperatures , characterized by a steady flow of reactions , as well as high temperature regimes where a @xmath2@xmath3-equilibrium is established , while @xmath4-decays or @xmath5-reactions feed the population of the next isotonic line of nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a gain of a factor of 15 in computational speed over a full network calculation , and an energy generation accurate to more than 15 per cent , this scheme also allows to predict correctly individual isotopic abundances . </S>",
