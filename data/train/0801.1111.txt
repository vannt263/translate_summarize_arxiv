    "characterizing old stellar populations provide important constraints on the early star formation histories of galaxies .",
    "only the satellite galaxies of the milky way ( mw ) are sufficiently close to resolve individual stars well below the oldest main - sequence turn - offs , which is a pre - condition for accurate photometric age dating of old stellar populations .",
    "all local group galaxies , for which adequate data exist , appear to contain stars older than 10  gyr @xcite .",
    "this result is based on main - sequence turn - off photometry of globular clusters and field populations in galactic satellites and a few more distant local group galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the detection of horizontal branch stars ( including rr lyrae variables ) in the local group and beyond .",
    "globular clusters are preferred as the basis for old stellar population age tracers since they are usually single - age , single - metallicity objects facilitating comparative studies .",
    "moreover , while globular cluster systems exhibit a range of ages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the oldest ones may belong to the most ancient surviving stellar systems to have completed their formation in the youthful universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in those nearby galaxies where relative age dating based on main - sequence photometry was carried out in comparison to the oldest globular clusters in the milky way , no age difference within the measurement accuracy was found ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the relative age dating of the oldest identifiable population  ii objects thus indicates a common epoch of substantial early star formation in the milky way and its companions , although information about a putative , even older population iii remains to be uncovered in these objects .    a galaxy that may _ not _",
    "share this common epoch of early star formation  at least not with respect to its globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  is the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "the smc is one of the closest and therefore best studied dwarf galaxies orbiting our galaxy .",
    "while the smc hosts a large number of intermediate - age and young star clusters , it only contains one  old  globular cluster , ngc121 , which is also the most massive star cluster .",
    "ngc121 is located @xmath7 2.4 ( @xmath73  kpc ) west of the smc bar at ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) = ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "ngc121 is the only cluster in the smc that is sufficiently old to have developed an extended red horizontal branch @xcite and to contain rr lyrae stars . indeed , whether or not to call a star cluster a globular cluster is a matter of definition .",

    "studies of various clusters in the lmc and in the mw showed that the presence of rr lyrae variables indicates that the parent population is as old as or older than @xmath7 10  gyr .",
    "an important question is whether ngc121 is as old as the typical old globular clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and in the mw .",
    "previous studies found ages ranging from 8 to 14  gyr for ngc121 @xcite using a variety of different techniques .",
    "studies based on the deepest available color - magnitude diagrams from hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) indicate an age of 10 to 10.6  gyr for ngc121 , suggesting that this globular cluster is several gyr younger than the oldest globulars in other nearby galaxies and in the mw @xcite .",
    "the capabilities of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) provide an improvement in both sensitivity ( depth ) as well as angular resolution , which is essential for a reliable photometric age determination in this dense star cluster . here",

    "<S> as first paper of a series devoted to study the old stellar population in clusters and fields in the small magellanic cloud , we present deep observations of ngc121 in the f555w and f814w filters , obtained with the advanced camera for surveys on the _ hubble space telescope_. the resulting color - magnitude diagram reaches @xmath0 mag below the main - sequence turn - off ; deeper than any previous data . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the age of ngc121 using both absolute and relative age - dating methods . </S>",
    "<S> fitting isochrones in the acs photometric system to the observed ridge line of ngc121 , gives ages of @xmath1  gyr ( teramo ) , @xmath2  gyr ( padova ) and @xmath3  gyr ( dartmouth ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster ridge line is best approximated by the @xmath4-enhanced dartmouth isochrones . placing our relative ages on an absolute age scale , we find ages of @xmath5  gyr ( from the magnitude difference between the main - sequence turn - off and the horizontal branch ) and @xmath6  gyr ( from the absolute magnitude of the horizontal branch ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these five different age determinations are all lower by 2  3 gyr than the ages of the oldest galactic globular clusters of comparable metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we confirm the earlier finding that the oldest globular cluster in the small magellanic cloud , ngc121 , is a few gyr younger than its oldest counterparts in the milky way and in other nearby dwarf galaxies such as the large magellanic cloud , fornax , and sagittarius . </S>",
    "<S> if it were accreted into the galactic halo , ngc121 would resemble the `` young halo globulars '' , although it is not as young as the youngest globular clusters associated with the sagittarius dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> the young age of ngc121 could result from delayed cluster formation in the small magellanic cloud or result from the random survival of only one example of an initially small number star clusters . </S>"
