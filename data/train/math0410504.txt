    "in the present paper , we continue the study of topological properties of the group @xmath2 of all borel automorphisms of a standard borel space @xmath1 .",
    "we consider two topologies , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , on @xmath2 which take their origins in ergodic theory .",
    "they were defined and studied in the context of borel and cantor dynamics in @xcite .",
    "recall that the topology @xmath3 is defined by the base of neighborhoods @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are borel probability measures on @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "obviously , @xmath3 is a direct analogue of the well known uniform topology on the group @xmath15 of all non - singular automorphisms of a measure space generated by the metric @xmath16 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , in fact , @xmath15 is formed by classes of automorphisms coinciding @xmath17-almost everywhere .",
    "it allows one to neglect the behavior of automorphisms on sets of zero measure .",
    "topological properties of @xmath18 were extensively studied in ergodic theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the other topology , @xmath4 , on @xmath2 is defined by neighborhoods @xmath19 where @xmath20 are borel sets .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath4 can be treated as an analogue of the weak topology @xmath21 which has been also widely used in ergodic theory .",
    "note also that , in the context of cantor dynamics , @xmath4 is equivalent to the @xmath22-topology on the set of all homeomorphisms .",
    "based on this observation , we call @xmath3 and @xmath4 the uniform and weak topologies on @xmath2 respectively .",
    "our goal is to find out which of topological properties known in ergodic theory for @xmath15 hold for @xmath2 with respect to the topologies @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , it is important for many applications to know dense subsets in @xmath2 which consist of relatively simple \" borel automorphisms .",
    "it was shown in [ bdk1 ] that the set @xmath23 of periodic automorphisms is dense in @xmath24 but non - dense in @xmath5 .",
    "therefore one needs to extend @xmath23 to produce a dense subset in @xmath2 with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the class @xmath25 of smooth borel automorphisms is a natural extension of periodic automorphisms . by definition , @xmath26 is smooth if there exists a borel subset in @xmath13 which intersects every @xmath26-orbit exactly once . in this paper",
    "( see section 2 ) , we prove that the set of smooth borel automorphisms is dense in @xmath27",
    ". this statement has been conjectured by a.  kechris .",
    "a number of papers in ergodic theory was devoted to the study of connectedness of @xmath15 in the weak and uniform topologies ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it was proved that @xmath15 was path - connected and even contractible .",
    "it is not hard to show that @xmath2 is not path - connected in @xmath3 because there is no continuous path connecting the identity with an automorphism with countable support . at first sight",
    ", the situation seems to be different in borel dynamics .",
    "but if we factorize @xmath2 ( like in ergodic theory ) by a closed normal subgroup consisting of automorphisms whose behavior can be neglected , we do produce a path - connected quotient group . from this point of view , it is natural to say that @xmath28 are equivalent if they are different on an at most countable set .",
    "if @xmath6 denotes the group of all borel automorphisms with countable support , then @xmath29 is a hausdorff topological group with respect to the quotient topologies @xmath8 and @xmath10 . note that the group @xmath6 was also considered in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that such a factorization improves topological properties @xmath2 in both quotient topologies @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "namely , the group @xmath30 becomes path - connected and @xmath31 possesses the so called _ rokhlin property _ , i.e. the action of @xmath9 on itself by conjugation is topologically transitive ( see @xcite for the rokhlin property in cantor dynamics ) .",
    "in fact , we prove an even stronger result by showing that the conjugacy class of every aperiodic smooth automorphism is dense .",

    "we collected in section 1 definitions and facts which are used in the paper .",
