    "the search for antimatter particles from dark matter annihilations or decays is usually hindered by the existence of large astrophysical backgrounds , which make difficult to unequivocally attribute any possible excess in the fluxes to an exotic origin .",
    "a possible exception is the search for cosmic antideuterons .",
    "the flux of antideuterons expected from spallations of cosmic rays on the interstellar medium is peaked at a kinetic energy per nucleon @xmath0 gev / n and rapidly decreases at smaller kinetic energies  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the spectrum of antideuterons from dark matter annihilations or decays is usually much flatter at low kinetic energies and could easily overcome the astrophysical background  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it has been argued that the search of antideuterons from dark matter annihilations or decays is practically background free and that the observation of one single cosmic antideuteron would constitute an evidence for an exotic antideuteron source .",
    "several authors have calculated the expected antideuteron flux at the earth in scenarios of dark matter annihilations @xcite or decays @xcite , using a factorized approximation of the coalescence model ; these analyses have been recently revisited in @xcite using an event - by - event simulation .",
    "antideuterons are produced by the coalescence of one antiproton and one antineutron .",
    "it is then apparent that there is a strong correlation between the cosmic antideuteron flux and the cosmic antiproton flux . in this paper",
    "we will analyze the prospects to detect primary antideuterons at ams-02 @xcite or gaps @xcite , in view of the existing limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section or decay width into antiprotons from the pamela data on the cosmic antiproton - to - proton fraction  @xcite .",
    "we will show that , although the limits on the cross section or the decay width that follow from the non - observation on an excess in the measured antiproton - to - proton fraction are very sensitive to the choice of the propagation parameters and , to a lesser extent , to the choice of the dark matter halo profile , due to the correlation between the antideuteron and the antiproton production and propagation mechanisms , most of the uncertainties cancel out when calculating an upper limit on the antideuteron flux and the number of antideuteron events , thus giving fairly robust conclusions .",
    "we will analyze in section [ sec : coalescence ] the antideuteron production employing the coalescence model , which has only one free parameter , the coalescence momentum .",
    "we will determine this parameter using an event - by - event monte carlo simulation , analyzing data from various experiments measuring antideuteron or deuteron production .",
    "our calculation suggests that the coalescence momentum is not universal , but depends on the underlying process and on the center of mass energy . using the same event - by - event monte carlo",
    ", we then calculate in section [ sec : dm ] an upper limit on the antideuteron flux and the number of events at ams-02 and gaps for two representative scenarios of dark matter annihilation and decay , imposing the requirement that the cosmic antiproton - to - proton ratio is in agreement with the pamela measurements .",
    "lastly , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we will present our conclusions .",
    "to describe the antideuteron production we will employ the coalescence model  @xcite , which postulates that the probability of the formation of an antideuteron out of an antiproton - antineutron pair with given four - momenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be approximated as a narrow step function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 . in this model , the coalescence momentum @xmath5 is the maximal relative momentum of the two antinucleons that still allows the formation of an antideuteron .",
    "one can show  @xcite that for @xmath6 , being @xmath7 , this ansatz leads to the following differential antideuteron yield in momentum space : @xmath8 so the number of antideuterons scales with @xmath9 .",
    "note furthermore , that under the assumption of statistical independence of the antiproton and antineutron production , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : general_coal_formula ] ) reduces again to the formula used in the factorized approximation of the coalescence model  @xcite .",
    "appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : general_coal_formula ] ) is included in the definition of the coalescence momentum , resulting in a value of @xmath5 which is one half of the coalescence momentum defined through eq .",
    "( [ eqn : general_coal_formula ] ) . ] in absence of a microscopic understanding of the coalescence mechanism , the coalescence momentum @xmath5 should be determined from experiments .",
    "we have analyzed various high - energy processes of antideuteron production and we have implemented the coalescence model in an event - by - event simulation . concretely , we have used the monte carlo generators pythia 6  @xcite or pythia 8  @xcite to simulate the processes and we have selected those events with present an antiproton - antineutron pair in the final state with a relativistic invariant momentum difference @xmath10 . furthermore , we have also required that the antiproton and the antineutron are close in position space , as the nuclear forces that are responsible for the binding of the antideuteron have a finite range in the order of a few fm .",
    "hence , we have included in our analysis the antiprotons and antineutrons produced directly in the hadronization process as well as those produced in strong decays , such as from @xmath11 decay which promptly decay with a lifetime @xmath12 s , very close to the primary vertex .",
    "in contrast , we have neglected those produced in weak decays , such as from @xmath13 and @xmath14 decay , which have a lifetime @xmath15 s and which then have a macroscopic decay length , much larger than the typical range of the nuclear forces . in consequence , antinucleons produced in weak decays have no chance to coalesce with antinucleons produced in the hadronization or in other weak decays , even if their relative momentum is smaller than @xmath5 .",

    "it follows from the figure that , for dark matter annihilation / decays into @xmath105 , the number of expected antideuteron events is below one for a wide range of dark matter masses , except when the dark matter particle is relatively light , @xmath120 , where one event could be observed after 5 years of data taking .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the observation of one cosmic antideuteron at ams-02 , although a fantastic discovery in itself , can not be interpreted as a signal of dark matter annihilation / decay since it could be an upper fluctuation of the antideuteron background .",
    "instead , in order to claim a 95% c.l .",
    "indication for an antideuteron excess , at least 2 events should be observed .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn when the dark matter particle annihilates or decays into @xmath44 .",
    "is background free with the ams-02 sensitivity .",
    "nevertheless , restricting the search to this window yields a number of antideuterons from dark matter annihilations / decays which is smaller than one in the whole range of masses . ]",
    "the prospects for detection of antideuterons from dark matter annihilations / decays at gaps uldb are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n - gaps ] . for gaps uldb",
    "it is expected the observation of @xmath121 antideuterons from spallations of cosmic rays on the interstellar medium , thus being practically a background free experiment . indeed , as shown in the figure , the observation of one single antideuteron event would suffice to assert with a 95% c.l .",
    "the exotic origin of that antideuteron .",
    "again , we find that for a wide range of parameters it is expected less than one antideuteron event for the med and min propagation models , except for very low dark matter masses . only for the max propagation model ,",
    "the observation of one or two antideuteron events would be possible in view of the constraints on these annihilation / decay channels from the non - observation of an excess in the @xmath106 ratio measured by pamela , provided @xmath122 gev ( @xmath123 gev ) for annihilations into @xmath105 ( @xmath124 ) ; for decaying dark matter the results are analogous , replacing @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "it should be stressed that these conclusions apply for a value of the coalescence momentum @xmath42 mev .",
    "however , as argued in section [ sec : coalescence ] , for annihilations into @xmath49 the coalescence momentum could be larger for heavier dark matter particles , when the center of mass energy of the process increases .",
    "if this is the case , the antideuteron flux , which is proportional to the third power of the coalescence momentum , could be significantly enhanced , improving the prospects to detect antideuterons from dark matter annihilations / decays at ams-02 or at gaps .",
    "for example , if the coalescence momentum for the annihilation of dark matter particles into @xmath44 reaches 236 mev , as hinted by the zeus data , the number of expected antideuterons would almost double the prospects presented in the right plots of figs .",
    "[ fig : n - ams],[fig : n - gaps ] .",
    ", the calculation of the background flux also suffers from hadronic uncertainties which conservatively amount to one order of magnitude . the uncertainty in the number of background events then ranges between 0.09 and 0.49 at ams-02 and between 0.018 and 0.16 at gaps .",

    "we have studied the prospects to observe antideuterons at ams-02 and gaps from dark matter annihilations or decays , in view of the stringent limits on the existence of an exotic component in the cosmic antiproton - to - proton ratio which follow from the pamela measurements .",
    "the antideuteron production was simulated using the coalescence model in an event - by - event monte carlo , being the coalescence momentum the only free parameter . to determine the value of this parameter we analyzed data from the experiments aleph , cleo , cern - isr and zeus , as well as preliminary data from alice .",
    "we have found that the event - by - event monte carlo reproduces fairly well the data , however the coalescence momentum is not a universal parameter but depends on the underlying process and the center of mass energy .",
    "this result suggests that the coalescence model commonly used in the literature is oversimplified and should be extended . in this paper",
    "we have not attempted to construct an improved coalescence model but , in view of the qualitatively good description of the experimental data on antideuterons , we have used the simplest model adopting the value of the coalescence momentum inferred from the aleph measurements of the antideuteron multiplicity in @xmath16 boson decay and we have discussed the impact of a different value of the coalescence momentum on our conclusions .",
    "the calculation of the maximal antideuteron flux and the maximal number of antideuteron events from dark matter annihilation or decays at ams-02 or gaps suffers from various sources of uncertainty . to evaluate the particle physics uncertainties we have considered two representative dark matter annihilation and decay modes , namely into @xmath43 and into @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , we have taken into account various astrophysical uncertainties , such as the choice of the dark matter halo model , the propagation model or the value of the fisk potential .",
    "while the primary antiproton and antideuteron fluxes are very sensitive to the choice of the propagation model and , to a lesser extent , to the choice of the halo model , due to the fact that the antiproton and antideuteron propagation are tightly correlated , most of the uncertainties cancel out when calculating the primary antideuteron flux normalized to the primary contribution to the cosmic antiproton - to - proton ratio , giving maximum fluxes which are fairly insensitive to the astrophysical uncertainties .",
    "we have found that the stringent limits on the abundance of primary antiprotons in cosmic rays from the pamela experiment severely constrain the possibility of observing antideuterons from dark matter annihilations or decays at ams-02 or gaps . at ams-02",
