    "neutrinos play a central role as probes in astroparticle physics and are basic indicators of what may lie ahead of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations comes mainly from the study of `` heavenly '' neutrinos  @xcite , and has been brilliantly confirmed by laboratory data from reactors  @xcite and accelerators  @xcite .    here",
    "i summarize the status of the interpretation of the current neutrino data within the simplest cp - conserving three - neutrino oscillation scenario .",
    "in addition to a determination of the solar and atmospheric oscillation parameters @xmath0 & @xmath1 and @xmath2 & @xmath3 , one gets a constraint on the angle @xmath4 .",
    "together with the small ratio @xmath5 the angle @xmath4 holds the key for future searches for cp violation in neutrino oscillation .",
    "the growing precision of oscillation experiments also opens good prospects for improved robustness tests , probing unitarity violation  @xcite and other forms of non - standard neutrino interactions .",
    "the search for lepton number violating processes such as neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite ( ) constitutes a very important goal for the future , as this will probe whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles , irrespective of the mechanism that induces their mass .",
    "this is known as the `` black - box '' theorem  @xcite .",
    "in addition , will be sensitive to the absolute scale of neutrino mass and to cp violation induced by the so - called majorana phases  @xcite , inaccessible in conventional oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of oscillations marks a turning point in particle and nuclear physics and implies that neutrinos have masses .",
    "this possibility has been first suggested by theory in the early eighties , both on general grounds and on the basis of different versions of the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient is the lepton mixing matrix , whose simplest unitary 3-dimensional form is given as  @xcite @xmath6 where each @xmath7 is effectively @xmath8 , characterized by an angle and a cp phase .",
    "majorana phases do not affect oscillations and , moreover , current neutrino oscillation data have no sensitivity to the remaining dirac cp violation phase .",
    "thus we set the three phases to zero . in this",
    "approximation oscillations depend on the three mixing parameters @xmath9 and on the two mass - squared splittings @xmath10 and @xmath11 characterizing solar and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the hierarchy @xmath12 implies that , to a good approximation , one can set @xmath13 in the analysis of atmospheric and accelerator data , and @xmath3 to infinity in the analysis of solar and reactor data .",

    "in contrast , the determination of solar neutrino parameters is not quite robust against the existence of nsi  @xcite , even if reactor data are included .",

    "the emergence of dirac neutrinos would constitute a surprise , indicating the existence of a fundamental lepton number symmetry whose origin should be understood . without a specific reason , the appearance of such symmetry would be `` accidental '' .",
    "nevertheless there are interesting ideas for generating light dirac neutrinos .",
    "for example , theories involving large extra dimensions offer a novel scenario to account for small neutrino masses  @xcite . according to this picture ,",
    "right - handed neutrinos propagate in the bulk while left - handed neutrinos , being a part of the lepton doublet , live only on the sm branes . as a result",
    ", neutrinos can naturally get very small dirac masses via mixing with a `` bulk '' fermion",
    ".      charged fermions in the sm come in two chiral species to provide their mass after the electroweak symmetry breaks through the nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs scalar doublet @xmath25 .",

    "the magnitude of the resulting majorana neutrino masses are too small .",
    "alternatively , the strength @xmath29 may be suppressed by small parameters ( e.g. scales , yukawa couplings ) and/or loop - factors ( bottom - up scenario ) with no need for a large scale .",

    "since lepton number is ungauged , there is a physical goldstone boson associated with its spontaneous breakdown , the majoron .",

    "this model provides the first realization of seesaw that gives a dynamical understanding of the smallness of both type - i and type - ii terms .",

    "is the absence of the majoron , now absorbed as the longitudinal mode of the gauge boson coupled to b - l , which picks up a huge mass .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses gets correlated to the observed maximality of parity violation in low - energy weak interactions , a connection which is as elegant as phenomenologically irrelevant , given the large value of the b - l scale required both to fit the neutrino masses , as well as to unify the gauge couplings . * extended seesaw *    in any gauge theory one can add any number of ( anomaly - free ) gauge singlet leptons  @xcite .",

    "there are many models of neutrino mass where the dim-5 operator is induced from physics at low scales , tev or less .",

    "neutrino masses may be induced by calculable loop corrections  @xcite as illustrated in fig .",

    "@xmath78 denotes an 21 singlet vev used in ref .",
    "@xcite . clearly , even if the proportionality factor @xmath32 is large , the neutrino mass is suppressed by the presence of a product of five small yukawas and the appearance of the two - loop factor .",
    "the intrinsically supersymmetric way to break lepton number is to break the so - called r parity .",
    "this may happen spontaneously , driven by a nonzero vev of an 21 singlet sneutrino  @xcite , leading to an effective model with bilinear violation of r parity  @xcite .",
    "this provides the minimal way to add neutrino masses to the mssm , we call it rmssm  @xcite , to stress that it serves as a reference model . neutrino mass generation is hybrid , with one scale generated at tree level and the other induced by `` calculable '' radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass spectrum is typically `` normal hierarchy''-type , with the atmospheric scale generated at the tree level and the solar mass scale arising from calculable loops , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : rpsusy ] .",
    "currently five of the basic parameters of the lepton sector are probed in neutrino oscillation studies .",
    "data points towards a well defined pattern of neutrino mixing angles , quite distinct from that of quarks , and difficult to account for in unified schemes where quarks and leptons are related .",
    "there seems to be an intriguing complementarity between quark and lepton mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "there have been many papers trying to understand the values of the leptonic mixing angles from underlying symmetries .",
    "of course , this is part of the the problem of predicting quark and lepton mixings , a defying challenge for model - builders .",

    "its predictions should be corrected by renormalization group evolution  @xcite .    here",
    "i consider a specific idea to predict neutrino masses and mixing angles : that neutrino masses arise from a common seed at some `` neutrino mass unification '' scale @xmath30  @xcite , very similar to the merging of the sm gauge coupling constants at high energies due to supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "although in its simplest form this idea is now inconsistent ( at least if cp is conserved ) with the observed value of the solar mixing angle @xmath0 , there is an alternative realization in terms of an @xmath83 flavour symmetry which is both viable and predictive  @xcite .",
    "starting from three - fold degeneracy of the neutrino masses at the seesaw scale , the model predicts maximal atmospheric angle and vanishing @xmath4 , @xmath84 although the solar angle @xmath0 is unpredicted , one expects   symmetry that also predict the solar angle , e.  g. ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath85 if cp is violated @xmath4 becomes arbitrary and the dirac phase is maximal  @xcite .",
    "one can show that lepton and slepton mixings are closely related and that there must exist at least one slepton below 200 gev , which can be produced at the lhc .",
