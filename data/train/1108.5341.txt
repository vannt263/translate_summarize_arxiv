    "indeed , every support halfspace of @xmath1 is of the form @xmath7 for some @xmath8 and since @xmath1 equals the intersection of all its support halfspaces , the function @xmath0 uniquely determines @xmath1 . for a  proof of this and other elementary properties of the support function ,",

    "we consider the problem of estimating an unknown compact , convex set  @xmath1 from observations @xmath9 drawn according to the model @xmath10 where @xmath11 are unit vectors and @xmath12 are independent normally distributed random variables with mean zero and variance @xmath13 .",
    "we work with both fixed and random - design settings for @xmath11 .",
    "direct motivation for a  theoretical study of this problem comes from applications .",
    "for example , prince and willsky  @xcite , who were the first to propose the regression model  ( [ arunaroy ] ) for this problem , were motivated by an application to computed tomography .",
    "lele , kulkarni and willsky @xcite showed how solutions to this problem can be applied to target reconstruction from resolved laser - radar measurements in the presence of registration errors .",
    "gregor and rannou  @xcite considered applications to projection magnetic resonance imaging . another application domain where this problem might plausibly arise is robotic tactile sensing as has been suggested by prince and willsky  @xcite . under an observation model that is different from the one considered here , goldenshluger and zeevi  @xcite studied the estimation of the support function of the convex support of an unknown intensity function in the context of image analysis .",
    "additional reasons for analyzing this estimation problem arise from the fact that it has a  similar flavor to other well - studied regression problems :    it is essentially a  nonparametric function estimation problem where the true function is assumed to be the support function of a  compact , convex set , that is , there is an implicit convexity - based constraint on the true regression function .",
    "regression and density estimation problems with explicit such constraints , for example , log - concave density estimation and convex regression , have received much attention . some examples of work in this general area include balabdaoui and wellner  @xcite , balabdaoui , rufibach and wellner  @xcite , cule , samworth and stewart  @xcite , dmbgen and rufibach @xcite , groeneboom , jongbloed and wellner @xcite , mammen  @xcite , seijo and sen  @xcite .",
    "our model @xmath14 can also be viewed as a  variant of the usual linear regression model where the dependent variable is modeled as the maximum of linear combinations of the explanatory variables over a  set of parameter values and where the interest lies in estimating the convex hull of the set of parameters .",
    "while we do not know if this maximum regression model has been used outside the context of convex set estimation , the idea of combining linear functions of independent variables into nonlinear algorithmic prediction models for the response variable is familiar ( as in neural networks ) .",
    "let us now briefly describe the previous work on this problem .",
    "the least squares estimator has been the most commonly used .",
    "it is defined as @xmath15 where the minimum is taken over all compact , convex subsets @xmath16 .",
    "the minimizer here is not unique and one can always take it to be a  polytope ( convex set with finitely many corners ; more carefully defined in the next section ) .",
    "this estimator , for @xmath17 , was first proposed by prince and willsky  @xcite , who assumed that @xmath11 are evenly spaced on the unit circle and that the error variables @xmath12 are normal with zero mean .",
    "they also proposed an algorithm for computing it based on quadratic programming .",
    "lele , kulkarni and willsky @xcite extended this algorithm to include the case of nonevenly spaced two - dimensional @xmath11 as well .",
    "recently , gardner and kiderlen  @xcite proposed an algorithm for computing a  minimizer of the least squares criterion for every dimension @xmath3 and every sequence @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to the least squares estimator , prince and willsky  @xcite and lele , kulkarni and willsky  @xcite also proposed estimators ( in the case ) designed to take advantage of certain forms of prior knowledge , when available , about the true compact , convex set .",
    "these estimators are all based on a  least squares minimization .",
    "fisher , hall , turlach and watson @xcite proposed estimators for @xmath17 that are not based on the least squares criterion .",
    "they made smoothness assumptions on the true support function @xmath0 ( viewed as a  function on the unit circle or on the interval @xmath18 $ ] ) and estimated it using periodic versions of standard nonparametric regression techniques such as local regression , kernel smoothing and splines .",
    "they suggested a  way to convert the estimator of @xmath0 into an estimator for @xmath1 using a  formula , which works for smooth  @xmath0 , for the boundary of @xmath1 in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "hall and turlach @xcite added a  corner - finding technique to the method of fisher et al .",
    "@xcite to estimate two - dimensional convex sets with certain types of corners .",
    "there are relatively fewer theoretical results in the literature .",
    "fisher et al .",
    "@xcite , theorem 4.1 , stated a  theorem without proof which appears to imply consistency and certain rates of convergence for their estimator under certain smoothness assumptions on the true support function .",
    "gardner , kiderlen and milanfar  @xcite proved consistency of the least squares estimator and also derived rates of convergence .",
    "they worked with the following assumptions :    @xmath19 are deterministic satisfying @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the usual euclidean distance on @xmath2 [ see  ( [ l12 ] ) ] .",

    "@xcite , corollary  5.7 , showed that @xmath26 as  @xmath27 approaches @xmath28 almost surely , where @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the usual big - o notation where the constant involved depends on @xmath31 and @xmath23 .",
    "gardner et al .",
    "@xcite , corollary 5.7 , provided explicit expressions for the dependence of the constant with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath23 ( but not  @xmath33 ) which we have suppressed here because our interest only lies in the dependence on  @xmath27 .",
    "also see gardner et al .",
    "@xcite , lemma 3.2 , for implications of assumption  1 on the unit vector sequence @xmath34 .",
    "such a  strange dependence of the rates of convergence of the least squares estimation on dimension has also been observed in other situations ( see , e.g. , birg and massart  @xcite , van de geer  @xcite , seregin and wellner  @xcite ) .",
    "our results in this paper , described below , imply that the rates  ( [ gardls ] ) proved by gardner et al .",
    "@xcite for the least squares estimator are optimal when @xmath35 and suboptimal when @xmath36 .",

    "our estimators are based on regularizing @xmath38 by minimizing the least squares criterion on certain well - chosen subsets of the parameter space .",
    "in contrast to gardner et al .",
    "@xcite , we took the more customary approach in nonparametric statistics by proving rates for the expected loss or risk instead of almost sure bounds for the loss .",
    "an advantage is that this results in bounds for a  finite ( though large )  @xmath27 thereby circumventing the need to let  @xmath27 approach infinity .",
