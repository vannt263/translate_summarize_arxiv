    "topological phases of quantum systems that evolve in topologically nontrivial spaces , have attracted considerable attention in a wide variety of subdisciplines in modern physics .",
    "perhaps the most well - known example of such a topological quantity is the aharonov - bohm phase acquired by a charged particle that encircles a shielded magnetic flux line @xcite .",
    "this phase depends only on the winding number of the particle s path around the impenetrable region of magnetic flux , but it is insensitive to perturbations of the path .",
    "a topological phase acquired by a pair of entangled qubits undergoing cyclic local unitary evolution has been discovered @xcite .",
    "the topological interpretation of this phase relies on the relation between two - qubit states and the rotation group so(3 ) @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps most clearly seen in the case of the maximally entangled states .",
    "these states are in one - to - one correspondence with the points of real projective space @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the two possible topological phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be associated with the two homotopy classes of loops in so(3 ) . in other words",
    "the accumulated phase is not affected by continuous deformations of path of the cyclic evolution . the topological two - qubit phase has been observed in spin - orbit transformations on a laser beam @xcite and in a nuclear magnetic resonance setting @xcite .",
    "the notion of topological phase has been extended to pairs of entangled higher - dimensional quantum systems @xcite .",
    "these phases are integer multiples of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hilbert space dimension of each subsystem .",
    "thus , for such objects , fractional values may occur .",
    "the topological phase for a given cyclic local su(@xmath5 ) evolution of a state @xmath6 is restricted by the invariance of the determinant @xmath7 of the coefficient matrix . since @xmath8 for product states , the topological phase is only well - defined in the presence of entanglement .",
    "recently , the notion of topological phase has been extended to @xmath9-qubit systems @xcite .",
    "these multi - qubit phases may take fractional values for @xmath10 .",
    "the number of possible values increases rapidly with the number of qubits .",
    "all possible values for up to @xmath11 have been found using a combinatorial algorithm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a relation between the topological phases and the degree of nonzero polynomial entanglement invariants has been conjectured @xcite . as an example of such a relation , the possible topological phases @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for @xmath14",
    "can be linked to multipartite entanglement in the sense that three - tangle is a polynomial invariant of degree @xmath15 , namely the hyperdeterminant in the coefficient matrix @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the allowed topological phases are indeed restricted to integer multiples of @xmath17 .    in order to realize a multiple qubit system in a photonic device ,",
    "one may combine different degrees of freedom that can be manipulated independently .",
    "numerous experiments have employed polarization and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) to implement controlled operations @xcite and spin - orbit bell inequality @xcite . here",
    ", we propose an experiment to measure the topological phases for @xmath14 , in qubits encoded on photon pairs produced by spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "each photon carries a polarization and orbital degree of freedom .",
    "the three qubits are encoded in the orbital part of the signal photon and the two polarizations , by projecting the orbital part of the idler photon on a well - defined laguerre - gaussian mode . in this way",
    ", we demonstrate different three - qubit states that acquire the different three - qubit phases by employing local su(2 ) transformations in franson loop interferometers on each photon .",
    "the observed phases would be a signature of the local orbits and thereby a non - trivial signature of multipartite entanglement .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the theory of topological three - qubit phases arising in local su(2 ) evolution is described in sec .",
    "sections iii - v contain the experimental setup , where the generation of three different types of three - qubit states are described in sec .",
    "iii , the measurement of topological phases is described in sec .",
    "iv , and examples of evolutions that reveal the topological phases is given in sec .",
    "v. the paper ends with the conclusions .",
    "when considering interconvertibility of three - qubit states under stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) , the genuinely tripartite entangled states fall into two classes @xcite .",
    "these classes are termed the ghz - class and the w - class after their representatives , the ghz state and the w state .    by considering interconvertibility under local unitary transformations",
    "the two slocc - classes can be further divided into local unitary classes , or in other words , orbits of the group of local unitary transformations .",
    "the structure of such an orbit constitutes a qualitative description of the entanglement of the states belonging to the orbit .",
    "this is the most detailed description of the entanglement properties that can be given @xcite .",
    "since the action of the @xmath18 group is a trivial global phase shift , it is sufficient to consider the local su(2)-orbits to study entanglement properties .",
    "the structure of the su(2)-orbits of entangled three - qubit states has been studied by carteret and sudbery in ref .",
    "in particular it was shown that the local su(2)-orbit of a ghz state @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are orthogonal states , is quadruply connected .",
    "the four different homotopy classes of cyclic evolutions correspond to the four different accumulated phases , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . since these are the only phases allowed for a state with nonzero three - tangle it follows that the quadruple connectedness is related to the tripartite entanglement measured by the three - tangle .",
    "a @xmath24 phase shift can not be generated in a two - qubit system and is therefore a measurable quantity that indicates the presence of tri - partite entanglement .",
    "four different topological phases is in fact not the most common topological phase structure for local su(2)-orbits belonging to the ghz slocc - class . using the canonical form of three - qubit states of carteret _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , it can be seen that the set of local su(2 ) orbits that exhibit four topological phases forms a subset of the local su(2 ) orbits of the ghz slocc - class parameterized by four real parameters , while the full set of local su(2 ) orbits is parameterized by four real and one complex parameter .",
    "the states of this subset can , up to local su(2 ) operations , be written on the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "we will refer to this class of states as the x - class .",
    "a distinguished member of this class is the three - qubit state @xmath28 for which @xmath29 termed the three - qubit x state in ref .",
    "this state is maximally entangled in the sense that all reduced density operators for the individual qubits are proportional to the identity .",
    "note that the x state can be brought to the ghz state by application of a hadamard transformation on each qubit .",
    "hence , these two states are entangled in exactly the same way .    the states in the ghz slocc - class that do not fall in the x - class have only two different topological phases .",
    "since the x - class is a lower dimensional subset , a generic state in the ghz slocc - class is of this kind .",
    "an example of such a state , with a doubly connected local su(2 ) orbit , is a biased ghz state @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and latexmath:[$|\\alpha|^2 +    correspond to the accumulated phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the x state and a biased ghz state thus represents the two different topological phase structures present in the ghz slocc - class .",
    "the remaining three - qubit states with genuine tripartite entanglement belong to the w slocc - class , and have either the topological phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 , or no topological phases at all .",
    "we would thus not see any other sets of topological phases by studying states in the w class .",
    "this paper is concerned with three - qubit systems encoded in the polarization and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states of photons .",
    "we will be describing the polarization states in a basis of right and left circular polarization states @xmath20 and @xmath21 or alternatively in a basis of horizontal and vertical polarization states @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the relation between these basis vectors is given by @xmath35 .",
    "the oam states will be described in terms of a basis of laguerre - gaussian modes of first order @xmath36 and @xmath37 , denoted @xmath20 and @xmath21 similarly to the circular polarization states , or in a basis of the hermite - gaussian first order modes @xmath38 and @xmath39 , denoted @xmath40 and @xmath41 similarly to the linear polarization states .",
    "the relation between these bases is given by @xmath42 .",
    "it is useful to note that the x state prepared in a basis of circular polarization states and laguerre - gaussian modes is the ghz state , up to a relative phase factor @xmath43 of the two terms , in a basis of horizontal and vertical polarization states and hermite - gaussian modes .",
    "for example , if the x state in the @xmath44 basis has been encoded in the polarization and oam states of a photon pair , such that the first and last qubit are encoded in polarization states and the middle in the oam state of one of the photons , the same state in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 basis would be @xmath47 .",
    "we will consider the x state , the ghz state , and a biased ghz state in the @xmath44 basis since this allows us to implement cyclic local su(2 ) evolutions that reveal the topological phases and lie completely within the set of operators that diagonalize in the @xmath44 basis .",
    "considering the x state there are evolutions in each homotopy class that diagonalize in the @xmath44 basis , and thus allows all possible topological phases to be observed .",
    "this is true also for the biased ghz state .",
    "our experimental proposal is based on the spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) source of entangled photons first demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later used in other experiments @xcite .",
    "there , two adjacent nonlinear crystals cut for type i phase match are spatially oriented with their optical axis mutually orthogonal . starting from a linearly polarized laser , a quarter waveplate ( qwp - p ) can be used to produce a circularly polarized pump , and generate pairs of polarization entangled photons of the kind @xmath48 where the first term on the right hand side comes from the @xmath49 component of the pump while the second one comes from the @xmath50 component .    in order to realize the three - qubit system",
    ", we may add the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) quantum state of the photon pair @xcite .",
    "as already demonstrated @xcite , the spatial correlations imposed by the phase match condition in parametric down conversion are manifested in the oam transfer from the pump to the down converted photons , giving rise to an oam entangled state of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the topological charges of signal and pump photons , respectively .",
    "then , oam conservation imposes that the added topological charge of signal and idler equals that of the pump , leading to a superposition of all components compatible with this condition .",
    "the probability amplitudes @xmath54 associated with a particular oam partition is proportional to the spatial overlap between signal , idler , and pump transverse modes @xcite .",
    "now , the three - qubit realization can be achieved by pumping the spdc source with a laguerre - gaussian mode with @xmath55 and detecting the idler photon with a single mode fiber ( smf ) that admits only the @xmath56 component .",
    "then , coincidence measurements should be obtained only for signal photons with @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the postselected spin - orbit quantum state is @xmath58 since the subspace of first order paraxial modes have a qubit structure @xcite , we can now encode two qubits on the signal photons , namely their polarization and oam , and a single qubit on the idler polarization . from now on , we shall omit the idler oam since no operations other than detection filtering will be performed in this degree of freedom . therefore , the initial three - qubit state generated is @xmath59 where we have grouped together the signal degrees of freedom .",
    "now we shall discuss separately the two entangled three - qubit states of interest .",
    "we further show how to prepare certain product states that are used to investigate the role of entanglement in the topological phase measurements .",
    "first , we will see how to produce the three - qubit quantum state showing the @xmath0 topological phase .",
    "the proposed setup is sketched in fig .",
    "[ xsetup ] . in order to simply understand the setup ,",
    "it is useful to recall that the x state in the @xmath60 basis corresponds to a ghz state in the @xmath61 basis .",
    "therefore , following the setup , we shall be seeking for this state .",
    "first , an astigmatic mode converter can be used to transform the signal lg mode to a horizontal first order hg mode @xcite , giving @xmath62 this state could also be produced by pumping the crystals with the first order hermite - gaussian mode @xmath63 , still filtering the idler with the single mode fiber . in this case , the signal mode with optimal spatial overlap with pump and idler is also @xmath63 .",
    "this would exempt the use of the mode converter , making the system alignment considerably easier .",
    "then , a spin - orbit controlled not ( cnot ) gate is used to flip the signal hg mode conditioned to its polarization .",
    "the cnot gate is a mach - zehnder interferometer with input and output polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) .",
    "a dove prism ( dp ) oriented at @xmath64 and inserted in the @xmath65 arm makes the transverse mode conversion @xmath66 on this arm . after the cnot gate",
    "the three - qubit quantum state becomes the desired x state : @xmath67     +      in order to produce the biased ghz state showing only topological phase @xmath3 , the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ ughzsetup ] can be used .",
    "first , a half waveplate ( hwp - p ) with a suitable orientation is placed on the pump laser to set its polarization to produce the partially entangled state @xmath68 so that the initial three qubit state will be @xmath69 with the astigmatic mode converter removed , the transformation @xmath70 is performed in the @xmath65 arm of the cnot gate , giving @xmath71 now , two quarter wave plates inserted on signal ( qwp - s ) and idler ( qwp - i ) paths , make the polarization transformations @xmath72 and @xmath73 needed to produce the desired biased ghz state @xmath74     +      in order to investigate the role of entanglement in the topological phase measurements , it is important to compare the quantum states discussed above with product states that are equivalent to the x state and the biased ghz state in what regards the single qubit probabilities .",
    "for example , the product state @xmath75 has the same probability distribution as the x state for each individual degree of freedom in both the @xmath45 basis and the @xmath44 basis .",
    "this state is readily prepared by the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ prodsetup ] when the pump polarization is set to @xmath49 and the down converted photons are created at the product state @xmath76 . in the signal arm , the mode converter is then oriented to make the transformation @xmath77 , and the @xmath50 polarization passes unaffected through the cnot gate .",
    "then , two half - waveplates can be used to set signal ( hwp - s ) and idler ( hwp - i ) polarizations to @xmath78 , thus producing @xmath79 .    a product state with the same probability distributions as the biased ghz state in the @xmath44 basis",
    "could be @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 can be produced in the same way as @xmath84 , but with suitable settings of the mode converter and the hwps in order to provide the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "both @xmath84 and @xmath83 could also be produced by tailoring the pump mode in order to optimize the spatial overlap between pump , idler , and the desired signal mode , without the use of a mode converter on the signal arm .",
    "the role played by entanglement in the topological phase evolution can be investigated with two - photon interferometry , as we shall see in section [ numerical ] .",
    "the interference patterns produced by entangled states are clearly distinguished from those expected for product states .",
    "under local unitary operations , the quantum state of the three - qubit photon pairs evolve keeping their entanglement unaltered .",
    "the topological nature of the phase evolution is strongly dependent on entanglement , so that it is important to identify entanglement signatures on the state evolution . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , signatures of entanglement can be found on interference patterns between the evolved and the initial state .",
    "two - photon interference can be achieved with the well known franson setup , where each photon from a quantum correlated pair is sent through two alternative paths , a long and a short one @xcite .",
    "when the delay time between the short and the long paths is larger than the detection time window , the two - photon coincidence count exhibits interference patterns . each coincidence count may result from both photons following either the short or the long paths .",
    "photons going through different paths do not coincide .",
    "moreover , each arm of an spdc source has a considerably short coherence length , so that no single photon interference can occur .",
    "then , the overlap between the evolved and the initial state appears as the fringe visibility when the three qubits are individually operated in one arm and left unchanged in the other , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ utransform ] .     +    in order to simplify the experimental proposal , still being able to cover the topological structure of the three - qubit local su(2 ) orbits",
    ", we shall be dealing with diagonal unitary operations in the @xmath60 basis .",
    "for each polarization transformation , a sequence of two hwps ( dhwp ) oriented at @xmath2 and @xmath87 , respectively , can be used .",
    "the same kind of diagonal transformation for oam ( lg basis ) can be performed by a sequence of two dps ( ddp ) at different orientations .",
    "these schemes are sketched in fig .",
    "[ utransform ] .",
    "it is instructive to view the operations performed by the dhwps and ddp in the single qubit poincar representation . starting from a @xmath88 state ,",
    "a hwp with its fast axis oriented at angle @xmath89 makes the transformation @xmath90 , where @xmath91 represents a linear polarization state along a direction rotated by the angle @xmath89 with respect to the horizontal .",
    "therefore , a sequence of two hwps oriented at @xmath89 and @xmath92 , respectively , makes the cycle @xmath93 , which corresponds to path @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ poincare ] . since this path is composed of two geodesic segments , enclosing a solid angle @xmath95 , a purely geometric phase @xmath96 is acquired by single qubits initially prepared at @xmath88 .",
    "of course , the same solid would be enclosed by an initial state @xmath97 , but in opposite direction , giving a geometric phase @xmath98 .",

    ", we must perform interferometric measurements where a proper background for comparison between product and entangled states can be established .",

    "however , the role of entanglement must be captured from signatures on the evolution of the interference pattern , as the individual unitary operations are applied .",
    "we shall investigate these signatures numerically in the next section .",
    "to demonstrate the presence of the topological phases of the two different topological structures represented by the x state and the biased ghz state we give examples of cyclic unitary evolutions in each homotopy class for both states .",
    "the evolution of the interference pattern for these entangled states , as the unitary evolution is gradually implemented , is compared to the evolution of the interference patterns of product states with the same local statistics in the @xmath60 basis . since we consider unitary evolutions that are diagonal in the @xmath60 basis , no difference in the interference patterns between an entangled state and such a product state can be attributed to the local degrees of freedom .",
