    "( as models , corresponding distributions already proved useful for understanding paradigmatic effects driven by trapped particles @xcite ; yet , they can also form naturally as waves evolve @xcite . )",
    "then , assuming also that the wave envelope is smooth and evolves slowly enough , an adiabatic lagrangian density @xmath3 in the go approximation can be inferred from the general formalism reported in paper  i. for simplicity , we will focus on 1d nondissipative electrostatic waves in nonmagnetized plasma here . in this case , @xmath3 reads as ( paper  i ) @xmath13 which describes both the quasistatic potential @xmath14 ( if any ) and also the wave , to be characterized by the amplitude @xmath5 , the frequency @xmath9 , and the wave number @xmath10 .",

    "then , to prevent the quasistatic field build - up , the total electron current must remain approximately zero ( assuming that the ion current is zero ) .",
    "hence , the flow velocity of passing electrons , @xmath37 , is estimated as @xcite @xmath38 we will assume that such @xmath37 does not affect the plasma dispersion , the condition being that the right - hand side of eq .",

    "this is quite unusual .",
    "moreover , the third term in @xmath3 , which is due to the trapped - particle oc inertia , is completely independent of the field amplitude and yet can not be dropped as it still depends on @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "notice also that , at least qualitatively , those effects are not limited to the model of deeply trapped particles that we adopt .",
    "this is because the @xmath5-independent term in @xmath3 originates from the second term in eq .",
