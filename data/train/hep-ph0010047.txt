    "a few years ago the present author and simultaneously and independently a group at the university of bonn @xcite suggested that the @xmath8 symmetry breaking  t hooft interaction , induced by instantons in qcd , is a clue to the problem of scalar meson classification ( see p. in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the gist of that calculation is embodied in the sum rule @xmath9 , where @xmath3 are the observed pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath4 is the strange scalar meson at 1430 mev and @xmath5 are  the eighth and the ninth \" scalar mesons .",
    "this relation enables one to determine the mass of the second @xmath10 meson as a function of the first one and the ( strange ) scalar kaon mass ( the r.h.s .",
    "are the p.s .",
    "masses which are known ) .",
    "although one specific pair ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath12 states was proposed as leading candidates by both sets of investigators @xcite , it was not long before eq .",
    "( 1 ) was used to : ( 1 ) select other candidate @xmath5 pairs @xcite ; ( 2 ) try to identify the lowest - lying @xmath12 glueball @xcite ; ( 3 ) look for radially excited @xmath12 states @xcite ; etc .",
    "we note , however , that eq .",
    "( 1 ) was derived in the simplest possible effective chiral model with the t hooft interaction @xcite .    in this note",
    "i report the results of an analogous calculation in an extended effective chiral model with the t hooft interaction .",
    "this model includes dynamically bound ( `` composite '' ) vector- and , due to chiral symmetry also axial - vector meson states .",
    "the mixing of the pseudoscalar ( @xmath13 ) and the longitudinal component of the axial - vector ( @xmath14 ) states leads to an important phenomenon : the reduction of the constituent quark axial coupling constant .",
    "this reduction , however , occurs at different levels in the flavour singlet- and octet channels .",
    "we derive a modified mass relation @xmath15 & \\simeq & - m_{f_{0}^{'}}^{2 } - m_{f_{0}}^{2 } + 2 m_{k_{0}^{*}}^{2},\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our effective field theory that is a consequence of the broken flavor @xmath16 and @xmath8 symmetries . here",
    "@xmath17 are as above and @xmath1 is the constituent quark s flavor - singlet axial coupling constant .",
    "the nature of this symmetry breaking is also identical to the case without axial - vector states , only the size of the effect on scalar mesons is now reduced by a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "it is well known that the flavour - singlet nucleon axial coupling constant is : ( a ) much smaller than the flavour - octet one ; and ( b ) measured in deep - inelastic lepton scattering where it leads to the so - called `` nucleon spin problem '' , which , in turn is related to the @xmath8 problem @xcite .",
    "manifestly , the flavour - singlet channel longitudinal - axial - vector  pseudoscalar mixing depends on the @xmath8 symmetry - breaking t hooft interaction and hence on the @xmath8 symmetry - breaking t hooft mass that enters the l.h.s . of the sum rule",
    "our effective chiral field theory ought to have the same chiral symmetries as qcd , yet it ought to be more tractable than qcd itself .",
    "so we construct a chiral lagrangian with the requisite symmetries solely out of quark fields .",
    "the @xmath19 symmetric part of the qcd lagrangian ( quark - gluon interactions ) is replaced by a set of four four - fermion interactions ( one scalar + pseudoscalar and three vector and/or axial - vector ) with the same symmetry , whereas the @xmath8 symmetry - breaking term is given by the t hooft interaction generated by instantons in qcd @xcite @xmath20 \\psi   & + &   g\\sum_{i=0}^{8 }   \\big[(\\bar{\\psi } \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\lambda$}_{i } \\psi)^{2 } +     ( \\bar{\\psi } i \\gamma_{5 } \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\lambda$}_{i } \\psi)^{2 } \\big ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - & k \\left [ { \\rm det } \\left(\\bar{\\psi } ( 1 + \\gamma_{5 } ) \\psi \\right ) +   { \\rm det } \\left(\\bar{\\psi } ( 1 - \\gamma_{5 } ) \\psi \\right ) \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & - &   g_{v}^{(1 ) } \\sum_{i=1}^{8 } \\left [ ( \\bar{\\psi } \\gamma_{\\mu } \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\lambda$}_{i } \\psi)^{2 } + ( \\bar{\\psi } \\gamma_{\\mu } \\gamma_{5 } \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\lambda$}_{i } \\psi)^{2}\\right ] \\nonumber   \\\\ & - &     \\left [ g_{v}^{(0 ) } ( \\bar{\\psi } \\gamma_{\\mu } \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\lambda$}_{0 } \\psi)^{2 }   + g_{a}^{(0 ) }   ( \\bar{\\psi } \\gamma_{\\mu } \\gamma_{5}\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\lambda$}_{0 } \\psi)^{2}\\right ] ~ , \\ \\label{njl3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the latter interaction is a flavour space - determinant @xmath21-quark interaction , where @xmath22 is the number of flavors . in the flavour - octet channels",
    "one must have @xmath23 in order to preserve the chiral symmetry , whereas in the flavour - singlet channel the two coupling constants need not coincide @xmath24 .",
    "four vector and three axial - vector ( isovector ) currents are conserved in the chiral limit and the pion is massless . the chirally symmetric field theory described by @xmath25 in both its original @xmath26 and extended versions ( @xmath27 ) exhibits spontaneous symmetry breakdown into a nontrivial ground state with constituent quark mass generation and a finite quark condensate , when dealt with non - perturbatively .",
    "it is therefore essential to have a non - perturbative approximate solution that preserves the underlying chiral symmetry . to leading order in @xmath28 such an approximation",
    "is described by two schwinger - dyson [ sd ] equations : the gap equation and the bethe - salpeter [ bs ] equation .",
    "[ a chirally symmetric approximation going beyond the leading order in @xmath28 has been developed in ref .",
    "] this approximation involves ( self - consistent ) one - loop diagrams that are infinite without regularization , so one must introduce some sort of regularization at this level of approximation , say a momentum cut - off @xmath29 . this cutoff has a natural explanation in terms of instanton size within t hooft s qcd derivation @xcite and ought to be around 1 gev , where indeed it has traditionally been in the njl model . the lagrangian ( [ njl3 ] ) defines a perturbatively ( dyson ) non - renormalizable field theory , so we keep the cutoff which sets the 4-momentum scale in the theory .",

    "the gap equation establishes a relation between the constituent quark mass @xmath35 and the two free parameters @xmath36 and @xmath29 .",
    "this relation is not one - to - one , however : there is a ( double ) continuum of allowed @xmath37 and @xmath29 values that yield the same nontrivial solution @xmath35 to the gap equation .",
    "even if we knew the precise value of @xmath35 , which we do nt , there is still a great deal of freedom left in the ( @xmath38 ) parameter space .",
    "blin , hiller and schaden @xcite showed how to eliminate one of these two continuum degeneracies in the @xmath39 version of the theory by fixing the value of the pion decay constant @xmath40 at the observed value 93 mev .",
    "this procedure was extended to the @xmath41 case in ref .",
    "we shall follow the latter procedure in this paper .",
    "perhaps the most important consequence of the fixed @xmath42 constraint is the finite renormalization : ( i ) of the `` bare '' ( @xmath39 ) pion decay constant @xmath43 to @xmath42 ; ( ii ) of the bare pseudoscalar @xmath44 coupling @xmath45 to @xmath46 , and ( iii ) of the constituent quark axial coupling from unity to @xmath47 according to @xmath48 our @xmath42-fixing procedure yields a separate @xmath35 vs. @xmath29 curve for every value of @xmath49 , see fig .",

    "rather , we hope to have convinced the reader that a new aspect - the vector and axial - vector meson masses , or constituent quark axial - vector couplings - unexpectedly enters the subject .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the @xmath8 symmetry - breaking t hooft interaction causes a mass splitting between the singlet and octet scalar mesons in this effective chiral field theory .",
    "this scalar meson mass splitting is related to the analogous pseudoscalar meson mass splitting and the constituent quark flavour - singlet axial coupling constant that , in turn , can be related to the so - called nucleon spin problem .",
    "the latter two phenomena are well known manifestations of @xmath8 symmetry - breaking @xcite . in this model",
    ", however , the constituent quark flavour - singlet and octet axial coupling constants are almost entirely determined by the vector and axial - vector meson spectra and very little by the t hooft interaction .",
    "as these spectra are almost ideally mixed there is virtually no flavour - mixing `` strangeness - induced '' axial coupling and hence no polarized @xmath162 sea quarks .",
    "model type with fermion and vector and axial - vector meson d.o.f .",
    ", see ref .",
    "@xcite , only there the linear relations between @xmath95 and @xmath96 are always true in the born approximation , rather than being true merely in the tight - binding approximation , as is the case here .",
    "indeed one may argue that the aforementioned model of ref .",
    "@xcite can be obtained as the result of the bosonization of our effective chiral fermion field theory . ]",
    "these results are in disagreement with experiment , albeit subject to some potentially large theoretical corrections , so it is not quite clear yet if one ought to declare the model dead and abondon it , or work harder to improve it . on the one hand",
    ", one ought not be surprised by the large discrepancy , as the model is simple and can not pretend to be the whole story ( there is no confinement ) . on the other hand",
    ", it manifestly shows that the correct implementation of chiral symmetry is insufficient to reproduce the observed nucleon axial couplings .",
    "we have thus established a new connection between two apparently unrelated kinds of physics ( deep inelastic scattering and light meson spectra ) and hope thus to have opened a discussion of this potentially significant question in other models and in qcd .",
    "we expect that similar effects ought to exist in the coulomb gauge qcd models of mesons , such as those in refs .",
