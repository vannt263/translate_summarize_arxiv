    "in the coming few years the flavour sector of the standard model ( sm ) will have to pass its first detailed test , which hopefully leads to some hint to physics beyond the sm .",
    "being the most general renormalizable theory compatible with the observed broken @xmath1 symmetry and the observed particle spectrum , any effect beyond the sm has to show up at the scale of the weak boson masses as a set of operators with mass dimension of six or higher , where these operators have to be compatible with the sm symmetry .",
    "the coupling constants of the dimension - six operators scale as @xmath2 where @xmath0 represents the scale of the new physics .",
    "all the possible operators have been listed already some time ago @xcite , but due to their large number this approach is - in its full generality - useless for phenomenological applications , since every operator comes with an unknown coupling constant .",
    "thus it is unavoidable to restrict their number by some assumption . as an example one can consider the parametrisation of new - physics effects in terms of the peskin - takeuchi parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xmath7",
    "have been used , which are closely related to @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . ] which have been used in the analysis of the lep precision data .",
    "these parameters can be related to a certain subset of dimension - six operators @xcite and are thus an example for a generic analysis .",
    "however , up to now flavour physics lacks such a simple parametrisation of new - physics effects .",
    "looking at the list of dimension - six operators which can appear at the scale of the weak bosons only those with quark fields are relevant for flavour physics .",
    "these operators have either four quark fields ( in which case there are no other fields ) or two quark fields , in which case the remaining three mass dimensions are made up by either covariant derivatives or higgs fields .",
    "a specific feature of the sm is the significant suppression of neutral currents by the gim mechanism , making neutral current transitions very sensitive to possible new - physics effects .",
    "this has been investigated before in a number of publications ; see eg .",
    "@xcite . however , the symmetries of the sm suggest that one could also have effects in the charged currents , where the sm effects are at best ckm suppressed and thus one has less sensitivity to new - physics effects .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the impact of dimension - six two - quark operators , which could be induced at the scale of the weak bosons by some new - physics effect .",
    "we are aiming at a simple phenomenological parametrisation in the spirit of the aforementioned analysis of the gauge sector by peskin and takeuchi .",
    "a similar aaproach has been suggested recently for the higgs sector @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we classify the general dimension - six operators which are relevant at the scale of the weak boson mass , which are bilinear in the quark fields and which are compatible with the symmetries of the sm .",
    "we make well defined simplifying assumptions that restrict the number of parameters to only 6 .",
    "finally we discuss our result and conclude .",
    "we shall first write down the standard model contributions in order to fix our notation . starting from a @xmath8 symmetry we group the left - handed quarks according to @xmath9 and likewise for the right - handed quarks @xmath10 such that @xmath11 transforms as a @xmath12 and @xmath13 as a @xmath14 under @xmath8 .",
    "the higgs field transforms as a @xmath15 under this symmetry and we gather the two real fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the complex field @xmath18 into a @xmath19 matrix in terms of which one can easily switch to the non - linear representation by the replacement @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ( matrix valued ) field of the non - linear sigma model . ]",
    "@xmath22    we can now write down the lagrangian for a non - linear sigma model , having an @xmath8 symmetry , broken down to the diagonal @xmath23 by vacuum - expectation value @xmath24 of the higgs field @xmath25 leading to mass terms for the quarks . this corresponds almost to the ( ungauged ) standard model , except that @xmath8 is explicitly broken down to @xmath26 by the mass terms of the quarks .",
    "note that the higgs sector itself still has the full @xmath27 symmetry , which is the well known custodial symmetry .",
    "the renormalisable lagrangian invariant under @xmath26 corresponding to the ungauged standard model is @xmath28 where we defined the mass matrix @xmath29 where @xmath30 correspond to the mass matrices of the up / down - type quarks .",
    "note that the term proportional to @xmath31 explicitly breaks @xmath32 , leading to a splitting between up- and down - quark masses and to mixing between families .",
    "the standard model is obtained from gauging the @xmath26 symmetry , which means that the ordinary derivatives have to be replaced by covariant ones @xmath33 the physical fields for the neutral bosons are obtained by the usual rotation @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "( [ sm ] ) ( more precisely its gauged version ) is the most general renormalizable lagrangian with an @xmath26 symmetry and with this particle content .",
    "going beyond the standard model means to consider operators of dimension higher than four .",
    "it turns out that there are no dimension - five operators compatible with @xmath37 symmetry .",
    "the dimension - six operators appear with couplings suppressed by two powers of the scale of new physics @xmath0 .",
    "we are going to consider those dimension - six operators which involve two quark fields .",
    "they may be classified according to the helicities of the quark fields : left - left ( ll ) , right - right ( rr ) and left - right ( lr )",
    ". therefore the lagrangian is given by @xmath38 the two quark fields have in total dimension three , the remaining dimensionality has to come either from covariant derivatives or from powers of the higgs field .",
    "note that ( [ generall ] ) is in fact very general ; possible exceptions are e.g.  special models with more than one higgs doublet .",

    "these can be rewritten as four - fermion operators by the equation of motion for the gauge fields , and hence they are not in the class of operators we are considering here .",
    "the same is true for dimension - six operators involving the gluonic field strength ; we have not explicitly written these operators but , since the gluon momenta are again of the order of the masses of the external states , they can be dropped for the same reason .",

    "[ [ lr - operators ] ] lr - operators    @xmath69    the coupling matrices @xmath70 do not have to be hermitean .      in the standard model any coupling between left - handed and right - handed components of the fields is only due to the mass term .",
    "this implies that ( except for the top quark ) the corresponding yukawa couplings are very small .",
    "any dimension - six operator coupling left and right helicities will ( after spontaneous symmetry breaking ) either contain a mass term ( such as @xmath71 ) or it will mix into a mass term .",
    "in fact , evaluating diagrams of the type shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] will lead to a quadratic divergence which means that these operators will mix with the dimension - four mass term of the original lagrangian ( [ sm ] ) .",
    "hmmass    ( 100,30 )     +    in particular , even if the mass term in ( [ sm ] ) were absent , the operators @xmath72 would induce a mass of the order @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the coupling of @xmath26 and @xmath75 are the couplings of the @xmath72 , i.e. one of the matrix elements of @xmath76 . in order to comply with the observed smallness of the yukawa couplings we are led to our first assumption : _ we assume that a chiral limit exists , in which all quarks become massless , even if the dimension - six contributions are included . _    formally we can implement this limit by replacing each occurrence of the combination @xmath77 or @xmath78 by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a parameter which vanishes in the chiral limit .",
    "this replacement happens also in in the dimension - four piece ( [ sm ] ) corresponding to the standard model ; if the yukawa couplings in ( [ sm ] ) were of order unity , we could chose @xmath80 to be of order @xmath81 to achive the smallness of the yukawa couplings of the ( light ) quarks . likewise",
    ", this parameter will also multiply the @xmath72 , making these couplings small as well .",
    "thus we argue that in order to keep the light quark masses small the natural assumption for the couplings @xmath82 is @xmath83 which will make the contributions of all @xmath72 very small .",
    "however , the sm contribution to the neutral currents mediated by @xmath72 is also suppressed by the gim mechanism as well as by loop factors , so for the neutral currents the net - supression factor of the sm contributions relative to the the new - physics contribution is @xmath84 .",
    "still the absolute size of the effects is small and we shall neglect these contributions in the following .    we may use the above argument ( although here it may be weaker ) to consider the @xmath85 operators .",
    "if new - physics contributions are purely left - handed ( i.e. if we have only new interactions acting on the left - handed components ) , this would imply that all the @xmath85 are suppressed by two powers of @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath86 although this may be considered very restrictive we still will make this assumption and neglect also the operators of the type @xmath85 .    using this assumption",
    "we continue with assuming that the operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 shown in ( [ ll1 ] ) and ( [ ll2 ] ) yield the leading new - physics contribution . in particular , after spontaneous symmetry breaking one finds an anomalous quark - gauge boson coupling of the order @xmath84 .",
    "the next assumption we are going to discuss is flavour conservation .",
    "it is well known that flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) are very strongly suppressed . in the standard model",
    "the violation of flavour occurs through the fact that @xmath89 \\neq 0\\ ] ] implying that there is no basis in the left - handed flavour space where both mass matrices are diagonal .",
    "fcncs are suppressed in the sm by the gim mechanism @xcite .",
    "it ensures that only the mass differences between up- or down - type quarks are relevant for fcncs .",
    "therefore significant contributions in the sm can come from the top quark only , but these suffer from an additional suppression by the small mixing angles .    for the discussion of the dimension - six operators we shall use a concept similar to minimal flavour violation @xcite , which means that all the fcncs induced by tree level contributions of the dimension - six operators are assumed to vanish , i.e. the corresponding coupling matrices are diagonal in the mass eigenbasis .",
    "in particular , for our leading contribution shown in ( [ ll1 ] ) and ( [ ll2 ] ) we find after spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath90 the neutral currents from the operators in ( [ ll1 ] ) and ( [ ll2 ] ) yield @xmath91 where the ellipses denote contributions with higher powers of the fields .",
    "thus it is convenient to consider the combinations @xmath92 corresponding to the couplings for the neutral currents for the up - type and the down - type quarks .",
    "we may now formulate our second assumption : _ we shall assume that _",
    "@xmath93 = 0 = \\left [ m^d m^{d\\dag}\\ , , \\ , g^{(d ) } \\right],\\ ] ] _ which avoids fcncs at least at tree level . _",
    "the contribution of the operators ( [ ll1 ] ) and ( [ ll2 ] ) to the charged current is @xmath94 where the ellipses denote terms with additional fields .    in order to discuss the implications of ( [ cc ] )",
    "it is convenient to go to the mass eigenbasis . according to our assumption ( [ mfv ] )",
    "both @xmath95 and @xmath96 are diagonal in this basis , i.e. @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the ( unitary ) transformations to the mass eigenbasis for the left - handed up / down - type quarks . inserting this into ( [ cc ] ) we get @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the usual definition of the ( unitary ) ckm matrix from the diagonalisation of the mass matrices , which in this way are completely absorbed . ] .    due to the fact that both @xmath95 and @xmath96 have to be hermitean",
    ", we find that ( [ gdefs ] ) defines six real quantities parametrising possible new - physics effects occuring in the charged current . likewise , due to @xmath37 symmetry the same parameters appear in the ( flavour - diagonal ) neutral currents .",
    "the implications of ( [ veff ] ) are best analysed by studying the relations @xmath101 we note that @xmath102 is unitary , if @xmath103 which is equivalent to @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a real parameter .",
    "although the charged currents will then be as in the standard model , the neutral currents are still affected , see ( [ nc ] ) .",
    "similarly , if both @xmath106 and @xmath107 are proportional to the unit matrix @xmath108 with another real parameter @xmath109 we find that the effective ckm matrix is proportional to @xmath110 @xmath111    the elements @xmath112 and @xmath113 of the first row of the unitarity triangle have been measured quite precisely . for this first row",
    "we have @xmath114 where we here and in the following use the notation @xmath115 which defines the six parameters of our parametrisation .",
    "currently there is a statistically insignificant deviation from ckm unitarity @xmath116 speculating that this deviation is due to @xmath106 and @xmath107 , we get for the parameters @xmath117    most of the other tests of the flavour sector of the standard model usually involve the off - diagonal elements of ( [ unitary1 ] ) and ( [ unitary2 ] ) . in order to obtain non - diagonal contributions on the right - hand sides of relations ( [ unitary1 ] ) and ( [ unitary2 ] ) @xmath106 and/or @xmath107 have to have different eigenvalues . looking at the non - diagonal elements of ( [ unitary1 ] ) and ( [ unitary2 ] ) we get @xmath118 where @xmath119 are the elements of @xmath110 .",
    "making use of the unitarity relation for @xmath110 we get @xmath120    in the sm the relations ( [ utd ] ) to ( [ utu ] ) have vanishing left - hand sides and are usually visualised as triangles in the complex plane . here",

    "the usual @xmath121  physics unitarity triangle is given by ( [ utb ] ) . here",
    "the coefficients for the @xmath130 are of the same order which makes the measurement of this triangle sensitive to both coefficients . in the following",
    "we will mainly discuss this triangle since it is in the main focus of the @xmath121 factories .",
    "for the triangles containing the coefficients @xmath131 the discussion is analogous .",
    "using only matrix elements of @xmath102 we obtain for ( [ utb ] ) @xmath132 where we have dropped the superscript @xmath133 , since we shall only consider this unitarity triangle for the rest of the paper .",
    "furthermore , we can formulate all triangle relations with @xmath102 only ; therefore @xmath134 means @xmath102 from now on .",

    ", there is no additional source for cp violation in the proposed parametrisation .",
    "for this reason the angles appearing in ( [ utb ] ) are the same as in the original @xmath110 .",

    "the suppression originates on the one hand from the electroweak loop factor @xmath160 and on the other hand from the fact that this contribution is proportional to the gim violation ( [ unitary1 ] , [ unitary2 ] ) , which has to be a small quantity as well .     +    hmzoneloop    ( 50,20 )    ( 50,20 )    another effect of similar type is the modification of the @xmath161 parameter , whose deviation from unity is defined as usual by @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the transverse contributions to the @xmath155 and the @xmath165 self energies .",
    "clearly there is a contribution to the @xmath161 parameter from dimension - six operators which contain only higgs and gauge fields @xcite .",
    "an example is the operator @xmath166 which leads at tree level to a modification of @xmath161 .",

    "this indicates that a mixing of the operators ( [ ll1 ] ) and ( [ ll2 ] ) into operators of the type ( [ drhoop ] ) occurs .    keeping only the dominant contribution from the top quark we obtain @xmath167    we note that the operator ( [ ll1 ] ) conserves the custodial @xmath32 , while ( [ ll2 ] ) breaks this symmetry .",

    "if now the new physics effects would conserve @xmath32 we would have @xmath174 in which case the @xmath161 parameter again would not be affected .",
    "finally we may also consider the effect of the new - physics contributions in ( [ ll1 ] ) and ( [ ll2 ] ) on the forward - backward asymmetry for bottom quarks produced in @xmath175 collisions on the @xmath155 resonance . on resonance the forward - backward asymmetry is given by @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the left- and right - handed couplings of the particle @xmath179 .",
    "according to ( [ ll1 ] ) and ( [ ll2 ] ) we assume that only the left - handed couplings of the bottom quark deviate from the standard model values . inserting the couplings of the electron and the bottom quark we get @xmath180 where @xmath181 is",
    "the weak mixing parameter and @xmath182 is of order @xmath84 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the coefficient in front of the new - physics parameter @xmath182 is very small ; putting in @xmath183 which reproduces the best fit for the sm @xcite one obtains @xmath184 which makes such an effect hard to observe .",
    "currently there is a statistically insignificant deviation of the measured value @xmath185 from the standard model expectation . attributing this to @xmath182 yields @xmath186 which is quite enormous , because @xmath182 is of order @xmath84 and such a value would lead to a relatively low @xmath0 of order 500 gev .",
    "we suggest a possible parametrisation of new - physics effects in flavour physics . it is based on considerations of dimension - six operators , out of which",
    "we have discussed the operators with two quark fields only . making two more assumptions which is flavour conservation and the existence of a massless limit we can reduce the number of new - physics parameters to six .",
    "we discussed the impact of these contributions on charged as well as on neutral currents . in the sector of charged currents ,",
    "our parametrisation affects the analysis of the @xmath121 physics unitarity triangle in a well defined way by replacing the ckm matrix by an effective one .",
    "however , with present data most of the parameters can not be constrained significantly . due to the fact that the effective ckm matrix is not necessarily unitary anymore flavour changing neutral currents receive contributions at one loop from the violation of the gim mechanism which we assume to be small .",
    "furthermore , in the neutral currents the @xmath32 violating parameters affect the @xmath161 parameter yielding a possible contribution of order @xmath187 ; however , the neutral currents test a different set of parameters as the ckm analysis .",
    "finally , the forward backward asymmetry in @xmath188 is not very sensitive due to a small coefficient .    clearly",
    "the analysis of the above set of operators can not cover the full variety of possible new - physics contributions in the flavour sector .",
    "in particular , the set of all possible four - fermion operators has a nontrivial flavour structure , but is very large .",
    "consequently one has to impose additional assumptions concerning these operators to deal with them in practical applications .",
    "one possibility , which has been discussed already in @xcite , is to impose additional symmetries such as a horizontal or family symmetry .",
    "however , in general the couplings of the charged and neutral currents turn out to be of similar size . using the stringent constraints on fcncs yields",
    "very small couplings for the neutral current operators , which in turn then implies that also the charged current contributions will have very small couplings .",
    "at least in scenarios of this type it is justified to neglect the four - fermion operators e.g. in the analysis of the @xmath121 physics unitarity triangle discussed above .",
