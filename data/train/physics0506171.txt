    "observations of solar neutrinos  @xcite have offered the first experimental evidence in favor of non - standard effects , in particular neutrino flavor transitions induced by non - zero neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "solar neutrinos have been detected by radiochemical experiments ( i.  e. , homestake  @xcite , gallex / gno  @xcite and sage  @xcite ) which give an energy - integrated information on the solar neutrino fluxes , and by real time water cherenkov detectors ( i.  e. , kamiokande , super - kamiokande  @xcite and sno  @xcite ) which allow to observe the spectral distribution of solar neutrino events .",
    "however , the detection threshold in cherenkov detectors is limited to about @xmath5  mev by the radiopurity of the target mass and , as a consequence , only high energy @xmath0 solar neutrinos spectrum has been measured .    in the next future ,",
    "liquid organic scintillator detectors , such as kamland  @xcite and borexino  @xcite , will be operating with the goal of measuring the low energy solar neutrino fluxes , in particular @xmath6 , cno and _ pep _ solar neutrinos .",
    "the kamland experiment is a 1  kt detector located in the kamioka mine ( japan ) , at a depth of 2700 m.w.e .  of rock , operating continuously since january 2002 , with the main goal of measuring the flux of the @xmath7 s coming from all the japanese nuclear power plants .",
    "this experiment has spectacularly confirmed the so - called large mixing angle ( lma ) solution to the solar neutrino problem ( see , e.  g. ,  @xcite for a recent reanalysis ) .",
    "borexino is a @xmath8  kt liquid scintillator detector which is being commissioned at gran sasso ( italy ) , under 3800 m.w.e .  of rock ,",
    "whose main goal is the measurement of the @xmath9 solar neutrino flux .",
    "moreover , it has been recently proposed to realize a @xmath10  kt liquid scintillator detector , denominated sno+ , at the sno site ( snolab , canada ) under 6000  m.w.e .  of rock , after the completion of the sno detector physics program  @xcite .",
    "it is also under discussion the possibility to realize a gigantic ( @xmath11 ) liquid scintillator detector , the low energy neutrino astrophysics ( lena ) detector  @xcite , in the pyhsalmi mine ( finland ) at a depth of 1450  m ( @xmath12  m.w.e . ) , although other sites ( e.  g. , underwater in the site of pylos in greece ) have also been proposed .",
    "the observation of solar neutrinos in these detectors , through @xmath13e elastic scattering , is not a simple task , since neutrino events can not be separated from the background , and it can be accomplished only if the detectors contamination will be kept very low  @xcite .",
    "moreover , only mono - energetic sources such as @xmath9 or _ pep _ neutrinos can be detected , taking advantage of the compton - like shoulder edge produced in the event spectrum .    in this letter , we show that organic liquid scintillator detectors can also measure the @xmath0 solar neutrino flux by means of the @xmath1 charged current interaction with the @xmath2 nuclei naturally contained in the scintillators . the possibility to use @xmath2 as a target for @xmath0 neutrinos was pointed out in the past by  @xcite . here , we propose a technique to tag the solar neutrino events .",
    "namely , we propose to identify the signal by looking at the time and space coincidence with the decay of the produced @xmath3 nuclei .",
    "we perform a detailed calculation of the solar neutrino signal and of the background in kamland , borexino and sno+ , showing that these detectors will be able to extract the signal with a reasonable uncertainty in a few years of data taking .",
    "it should be stressed that the proposed technique does not involve any modification of the experimental setup , since one expects a background - to - signal ratio of the order of 1 or less even assuming the natural isotopic abundance of @xmath2 ( @xmath14 ) and the contamination levels already reached in the kamland detector  @xcite .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the neutrino interactions with @xmath2 . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the solar neutrino event rates . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the space and time coincidence with the decay of the produced @xmath3 nuclei .",
    "background issues are described in sec .",
    "vi presents the expected sensitivity for kamland , borexino and sno+ and prospects for lena . in sec .",
    "vii we draw our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath2 is a stable isotope of carbon with a natural isotopic abundance @xmath15% .",
    "a small amount of @xmath2 is , thus , naturally present in organic liquid scintillators and can be used as a target for neutrino detection .",
    "the relevant detection process in our discussion is the charged current ( cc ) transition to @xmath3 ground state : @xmath16 the reaction threshold is @xmath17  mev and , thus , only @xmath0 solar neutrinos are detectable ( with a neglible contribution from _ hep _ neutrinos ) . in liquid scintillators one observes the electron produced in the final state with a visible energy which , neglecting the detector energy resolution , is simply equal to the electron kinetic energy @xmath18 . the cross section of reaction  ( [ cc - ground ] ) is known with great accuracy , since it can be deduced from the decay time of @xmath3 .",
    "one has  @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electron energy , nucleus ( of the order of few kev ) . in this assumption , one has simply @xmath21 .",
    "] @xmath22 is the electron momentum , @xmath23 is the fermi factor and the @xmath24value of @xmath3 decay is experimentally determined as @xmath25  @xcite . by averaging the cross section over the @xmath0 neutrino spectrum , one obtains @xmath26 , which is about one order of magnitude larger than the cross section of @xmath27 scattering .",
    "the peculiarity of process  ( [ cc - ground ] ) is that it can be monitored by looking for the delayed coincidence with the positron emitted in the @xmath3 decay : @xmath28 which occurs with @xmath29% branching ratio ( 0.2% of @xmath3 nuclei undergo electron capture ) and a decay time @xmath30  s. in this case , the visible energy is the sum of the positron kinetic energy and the energy released in @xmath31 annihilation , so that the delayed events have a continuous energy spectrum in the range @xmath32 $ ]  mev .",
    "moreover , in the absence of macroscopic motions in the detector , the @xmath3 nucleus essentially does not move from its original position .",
    "the expected displacement due to recoil and diffusion  @xmath33s@xmath34 , which correspond to an average displacement in the time @xmath30",
    "s equal to @xmath35  cm . ] during the decay time @xmath36 is , indeed , smaller than the typical detector spatial resolution , @xmath37  cm .",
    "this means that the _ prompt _ event produced by the reaction  ( [ cc - ground ] ) and the _ delayed _ event produced by the decay  ( [ decay ] ) have to be observed essentially in the same position .",
    "this condition , as we will see in the following sections , is extremely effective in reducing the background .",
    "other interaction channels of low energy neutrinos with @xmath2 can , in principle , be considered .",
    "first , we discuss the cc transition to @xmath3 excited states . for solar neutrinos , only the lowest excited state ( at 3.51  mev ) could be of practical importance .",
    "the cross section for this process is about 30% of that for the ground state and it is calculated theoretically with an uncertainty at the level of @xmath38%  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath3@xmath39 decays almost immediately to @xmath40p with almost 100% branching ratio  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", it can not be discriminated by the coincidence with the delayed events  ( [ decay ] ) .",
    "the other relevant process is the neutral current ( nc ) transition : @xmath41 here , only the excited state @xmath2@xmath42 is relevant and the excitation to other levels has negligible cross section .",
    "the cross section for this process , averaged over the @xmath0 neutrino spectrum , is @xmath43 @xcite and it is affected by about @xmath44 uncertainty .",
    "the process is in principle very interesting since it can give a measure of the total @xmath0 flux and can be also tagged by a monochromatic @xmath45-ray emission back to the ground state .",
    "however , the great uncertainty and the low cross section make this process hard to be competitive with the nc measurement made by sno .    in this letter",
    ", we will mainly focus on the information which can be obtained from reaction  ( [ cc - ground ] ) , which , at present , seems more interesting in view of the larger and much better known cross section , and of the delayed detection tagging with the @xmath3 decay .",
    "a neutrino of energy @xmath46 interacting with @xmath2 through reaction  ( [ cc - ground ] ) produces an electron with kinetic energy @xmath47 ( neglecting the @xmath3 recoil ) .",
    "the rate @xmath48 of prompt events ( per unit mass ) produced by @xmath0 solar neutrinos in the energy window @xmath49 $ ] is thus simply given by : @xmath50 where @xmath51  @xmath52s@xmath34 is the boron neutrino flux  @xcite , @xmath53 spectrum is the following : @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58mev .",

    "the observation of this feature would be very important as a final confirmation of matter effect in solar neutrino oscillations .",

    "we remind that kamland has already analyzed data for a total exposure @xmath203  kty @xcite , corresponding to @xmath204 solar neutrino events in the window @xmath95 $ ]  mev which can be extracted with about 60% uncertainty . despite the large uncertainty , we believe that this measure would , anyhow , represent a milestone , since it would be the first observation of solar neutrinos into liquid scintillator detectors .",
    "we hope that the kamland collaboration will try to extract this piece of information from their own set of data .    in borexino and in sno+ , due to the larger depth of the experimental sites ,",
    "the background - to - signal ratio is much less than one .",
    "the sensitivity is thus only limited by the statistical error of the signal events .",
    "the low background level allows to explore with sufficient accuracy the energy windows @xmath90 $ ]  mev for which , at present , we have no direct information .",
    "this also indicates that , in these experiments , it will be possible to decrease the lower bound of the energy windows ( @xmath91  mev ) with only a moderate decrease of the expected sensitivity .",
    "we remark that , even if the background is negligible , the low expected counting rates do not allow to observe a possible distortion of solar neutrino event spectrum , unless the @xmath2 abundance is enriched and/or one considers gigantic detectors . in principle , @xmath2 enrichment is possible . is mainly used in health diagnostic , since it has a specific nmr signature .",
    "] however , the current separation techniques probably do not allow a massive production of this isotope .",
    "for this reason , we do not consider in detail this possibility .",
    "one should note , however , that even a partial enrichment ( e.  g. , corresponding to a @xmath2 abundance of the order @xmath205% ) could allow to obtain important results , like e.  g. , the high accuracy determination of the solar neutrino spectrum down to energies equal to about @xmath206  mev ( or the observation of _ hep _ solar neutrinos ) .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the perspectives for gigantic liquid scintillator detectors planned in the future .",
    "in particular a @xmath207  kt detector , the low energy neutrino astrophysics ( lena ) , has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the site proposed for the experiment is pyhsalmi mine in finland at a depth comparable to that of borexino ( @xmath12  m.w.e . ) .",
    "this means that the cosmogenic background will be sufficiently low for the proposed measure .",
    "the scintillator should be composed mainly by pxe ( c@xmath208h@xmath209 , with a molecular mass @xmath210 and a density density @xmath211 ) , but , of course , the final composition has yet to be decided .",
    "it is clear that , in such a large detector , it will be very hard to keep the internal background low .",
    "however , the gain in statistics will probably overcompensate this limitation . to give an example ,",
    "in one year of data taking with a fiducial mass equal to @xmath212  kt , one obtains a better sensitivity than in sno+ ( with 1  kt fiducial mass ) , even assuming a background - to - signal ratio of the order of ten . for this reason",
    ", we believe that the lena detector has the capability to perform a precise measure of the @xmath0 flux ( comparable to that provided by super - kamiokande and/or sno ) in a few years of data taking .",
    "in this letter we have discussed the possibility to detect @xmath0 solar neutrinos by using the @xmath1 cc - interaction with @xmath2 nuclei naturally contained in organic liquid scintillators .",
    "the proposed detection process has a low threshold ( @xmath213 ) and large and well - know cross section .",
    "moreover , one can take advantage of the subsequent decay of the produced @xmath3 nuclei to discriminate neutrino events from the background .",
    "we have calculated the expected event rates ( of the order of @xmath214  kty@xmath34 ) for kamland , borexino and an hypothetical borexino - like experiment situated at snolab ( sno+ ) . moreover ,",
    "we have evaluated thoroughly all the possible sources of ( external and internal ) background in the three considered detectors .",
    "we have shown that the background - to - signal ratio is @xmath215 in kamland , while is much less than 1 in borexino and sno+ .",
    "finally , we have calculated the expected sensitivity for the various experiments .",
    "assuming an exposure equal to @xmath189  kty , the solar neutrino signal can be extracted with uncertainty of the order of @xmath216% in kamland and @xmath217% in borexino and sno+ .",
    "the expected sensitivity scales as @xmath188 , since background is directly measured by the experiments .",
    "gigantic ( such as lena ) and/or enriched detectors , having a much larger statistics , will have the possibility to perform a very precise measurement of the @xmath0 neutrino flux .",
    "it should be stressed that the proposed measure does not require any modification of the standard experimental set - up .",
    "the kamland detector should be able to extract about @xmath204 @xmath0 solar neutrino events from the already collected data ( corresponding to a total exposure equal to @xmath218  kty ) .",
