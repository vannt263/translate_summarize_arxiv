    "in the last decade , a lot of investigations have been devoted to nucleon - deuteron ( @xmath0 ) elastic scattering to provide valuable information on nuclear interactions such as an evidence of a three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "serious discrepancies between theoretical predictions with conventional models of two - nucleon force ( 2nf ) and corresponding experimental data were found for some scattering observables in addition to the well known underbinding problem of the three - nucleon ( 3n ) bound states .",
    "an example of the discrepancies is that calculated nucleon- and deuteron vector analyzing powers are considerably smaller than the measured in a low energy region , say @xmath1 mev @xcite .",
    "another example of the discrepancies is observed in the proton - deuteron ( @xmath2 ) elastic cross sections around the minima of angular distributions , where the 2nf calculations underestimate the cross section systematically when compared to the measured ones at intermediate energies @xmath3 mev @xcite .",
    "the latter discrepancy has been solved by introducing a two - pion exchange three - nucleon force ( @xmath4e-3nf ) with a cutoff parameter adjusted so as to reproduce the empirical binding energy of the triton @xcite .",
    "however , the introduction of the 3nf provides only a small effect on the former discrepancy , or sometimes gives rise to worse agreements with experimental data on some spin observables @xcite .",
    "we are , therefore , still far from the final understanding of nuclear interactions in the 3n system .",
    "since the difficulties are concerned with the spin observables , detailed investigations on the contribution of spin - dependent interactions in the observables will be required for improving the relevant interactions .",
    "previously @xcite we have analyzed the imaginary parts of neutron - deuteron ( @xmath5 ) forward scattering amplitudes , which are transformed into combinations of total cross sections for polarized or unpolarized beams and targets by the use of the optical theorem . by decomposing the forward amplitudes according to their spin - space properties and examining the contributions of spin - dependent interactions to the components , we have succeeded in clarifying spin - dependent effects of the 3nf on combinations of the total cross sections . being encouraged by such success",
    ", we will here develop the previous work to the case of @xmath0 spin observables at finite scattering angles .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will examine the contribution of a particular spin - dependent interaction on the observables by tagging ranks of related spin - space tensors on the scattering amplitude as described below , and then will study which observable characterizes the effect of the particular spin - dependent interaction .    for the tagging , we will decompose scattering amplitudes according to the tensorial property in the spin - space . in such decomposition , where we obtain scalar amplitude , vector one , second - rank tensor one , and so on , each component specified by the tensor rank will describe the scattering by corresponding interactions : the scalar component will describe the scattering by central interactions , the vector one the scattering by spin vector interactions like spin - orbit ones , and the second - rank tensor one the scattering by tensor interactions . in the next section , such decomposition of the scattering amplitude is performed in a model - independent way by the invariant amplitude method @xcite .",
    "when the observables are described in terms of such decomposed amplitudes , one will be able to identify the contribution of the particular spin - dependent interaction by the help of the associated tensor rank . however , full expressions of the observables in terms of the decomposed scattering amplitudes are rather complicated . in sec .",
    "[ sec_3 ] , we will show that the central interaction will dominate the scattering at low energies .",
    "then the observables are described rather simply in an approximation neglecting second order terms of the vector and tensor amplitudes in the expressions .",
    "this approximation gives a clear insight into the role of each component of the interaction and one can obtain the information on the observables , which characterize the contribution of the component .",

    ", investigations are particularly focused on the contributions of 3nfs to the observables , which include various spin effects and are decomposed into scalar effects , vector ones , and tensor ones .",

    "we have proposed some combinations of the scattering observables for obtaining the detailed information on the contributions of the 2nf and various models of the 3nf .",
    "since each combination characterizes the contribution of a particular interaction , measurements of these quantities will provide clear tests for the validity of the interaction .",
    "the numerical investigations are particularly focused on the contributions of the 2@xmath80e-3nf and the so-3nf . as is well - known the 2@xmath80e-3nf provides the indispensable contribution to the triton binding energy , and by the present analyses it turns out that this 3nf effect produces clear contributions to the spin doublet scalar amplitude in the @xmath0 scattering , which can be examined by measuring the cross section and some spin correlation coefficients .",
    "further , the faddeev calculations clarify that the 2@xmath80e-3nf contributes also as the tensor interaction to the tensor amplitudes in the spin quartet scattering .",
    "these 3nf effects will be criticized by comparing with experimental data when the related observables are measured .",
    "the so-3nf produces the remarkable contribution to the vector amplitudes in the quartet scattering and also in the doublet - quartet nondiagonal transition .",
    "this improves the calculated vector analyzing powers of the proton and the deuteron successfully , although the agreement with the experimental data transformed for the nondiagonal transition is not so good as that for the spin quartet scattering .",
    "the sad approximation is useful to find the suitable combination of the spin observables for the examination of a particular interaction . in the present investigation ,",
    "the analyzing powers and the spin correlation coefficients are chosen as the spin observables .",
    "however , polarization transfer coefficients will also be available for the examination of the interaction .",
    "for the convenience of such applications , we will give in appendix [ app_b ] the formulas of the polarization transfer coefficients in the sad approximation , which will be useful in finding of suitable combinations for the test of the validity of particular interactions .",

    "<S> three - nucleon forces , which compose an up - to - date subject in few - nucleon systems , provide a good account of the triton binding energy and the cross section minimum in proton - deuteron elastic scattering , while do not succeed in explaining spin observables such as the nucleon and deuteron analyzing powers , suggesting serious defects in their spin dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we study the spin structure of nucleon - deuteron elastic amplitudes by decomposing them into spin - space tensors and examine effects of three - nucleon forces to each component of the amplitudes obtained by solving the faddeev equation . assuming that the spin - scalar amplitudes dominate the others , we derive simple expressions for spin observables in the nucleon - deuteron elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions suggest that a particular combination of spin observables in the scattering provides direct information of scalar , vector , or tensor component of the three - nucleon forces . </S>",
