    "<S> the unitality of the corresponding channel follows now from general eq .  </S>",

    "<S> namely , calculating @xmath71 in the basis of left and right scattering channels , @xmath72 , we obtain @xmath73 and taking into account the unitarity of the overall transformation , we arrive at @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> since this condition holds for any @xmath19 , then for any state the system evolves with @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the above consideration with some minor modifications holds for the grand system where the role of the reservoir is taken up by a single spin located near the scatterer . </S>",
    "<S> then the spin remains intact if the particle is reflected and is rotated by the magnetic field induced by the transmitted particle .    </S>",
    "<S> let us generalize the above consideration onto the particle propagating along the two - dimensional array of scatterers and spins ( comprising the reservoir ) located in the @xmath75-plane . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field induced by the propagating particle is perpendicular to the plane , and all spins experience the commuting unitary rotations around the perpendicular @xmath76-axis . </S>",
    "<S> all the rotations commute , hence the condition of the quantum @xmath0-theorem is satisfied and @xmath10 .        </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the property of unitality of the grand system with the spin reservoir preserves in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) case . as we mentioned above , the rotations experienced by an individual spin may appear , in general , non - commuting . </S>",

    "<S> we see that in the macroscopic limit of the number of spins , the averaged commutators appearing in the condition for the @xmath0-theorem vanish in spite of the fact that the commutators for the individual spins could remain finite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the evolution of the 3d system involved occurs with @xmath10 .    to proceed further , </S>",
    "<S> we note , that if one can find a basis in the reservoir hilbert space where all @xmath87-operators are diagonal , then the operators @xmath87 commute . </S>",
    "<S> below we present two generic physical examples where this basis can be found explicitly : ( i ) an electron interacting with adiabatic two - level impurities and ( ii ) electron - phonon interaction in solids .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the electron scattering on impurities that fluctuate between two positions with nearly equal energies . </S>",
    "<S> to be concrete we focus on the random walk of the electron along the ensemble of tls ( see the description of the similar systems in refs .  ) as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tls ] . assume for simplicity that ( i )  the dynamics of a tls is slow hence its state does not change during the interaction with the electron and that ( ii )  each tls which is in the state @xmath88@xmath89 ( @xmath88@xmath90 ) , scatters the electron via elastic unitary matrix @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the global unitary transformation is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 describes the scattering on the @xmath95-th impurity . </S>",

    "<S> then the reservoir operator @xmath98 with @xmath99_{\\textbf{k } \\textbf{k } ' } |{\\uparrow_n}\\rangle \\langle{\\uparrow_n}| + [ \\hat{s}_{\\downarrow}^{\\scriptscriptstyle(n)}]_{\\textbf{k } \\textbf{k } ' } |{\\downarrow_n}\\rangle \\langle{\\downarrow_n}|$ ] , see eq .  , </S>",
    "<S> commute with each other and , therefore , the second term in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in each particular scattering event the entropy of the particle is non - diminishing .    </S>",
    "<S> the question that now arises is whether the non - diminishing entropy maintains for the sequence of scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> recall that in order for the entropy to grow monotonously , an electron should be disentangled from the tls with which it is going to interact . since </S>",
    "<S> in the course of the evolution an electron may return to the tls on which it scattered and , therefore , got entangled in the past , these returns would violate this ` initial non - entanglement condition . ' </S>",
    "<S> thus to guarantee the evolution with non - diminishing entropy the tls should have interacted with some other degrees of freedom that would lead to the memory loss of this tls prior to the possible return of the electron . </S>",
    "<S> this memory loss is the manifestation of the so - called _ monogamy _ of entanglement@xcite which is a specific property of the entanglement distribution between quantum systems : if a tls is already entangled with an electron and later it becomes entangled with another degree of freedom then the initial entanglement with the electron vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> thus the process of sequential scattering of an electron satisfies the @xmath0-theorem if the typical entanglement time for the tls is less than the typical return time of an electron to particular tls .        </S>",
    "<S> now we demonstrate that the electron - phonon interaction leads to the electron evolution which satisfies the conditions of quantum @xmath0-theorem . in a standard electron - phonon interaction model , a representative test </S>",
    "<S> electron ` sees ' a screened short - range ionic potential . </S>",
    "<S> since the resulting scattering time is short and the ion is much heavier than the electron , the position of a given ion remains nearly unchanged during the interaction with the electron , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice ] . then the standard consideration of the electron - phonon interaction@xcite results in a conclusion that at high temperatures where the typical energy of an electron is relatively high ( i.e. it exceeds the debye energy , the maximal energy of phonons ) , the electron - phonon collisions are quasi - elastic . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to apply the same arguments as for the model of an electron interacting with two - level impurities considered above . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the slow ion - dynamics preserves the classical distribution function , @xmath100 , for the ions positions @xmath101 and hence the induced @xmath43-operators are diagonal in the ion coordinate basis , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 are electron scattering matrix on the potential defined by the ions positions @xmath104 </S>",
    "<S> . therefore the conditions of the quantum @xmath0-theorem hold for electrons with energies exceeding the debye energy . </S>",
    "<S> the initial disentanglement of the electron from the ionic reservoir is ensured either by the fact that a given ion did not participate in the previous collisions with the electron , or has already ` forgotten ' about such an event due to the monogamy of entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that unlike the other systems discussed in previous sections , the evolution of the electron - phonon system does not occur in the unital channel . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it satisfies the condition of the @xmath0-theorem thus illustrating a mathematical result establishing that for some classes of initial states even the evolution defined by non - unital channels may occur with the non - diminishing entropy.@xcite    we are delighted to thank g. blatter , g .- </S>",
