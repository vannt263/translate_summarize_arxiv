    "m82 and ngc 253 are two of the nearest `` starburst '' galaxies ( we assume distances of 3.6 and 2.5 mpc , respectively ; freedman _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; davidge & prichett 1990 ) where extensive star formation in the @xmath4 1 kpc - scale nuclear regions ( rieke _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 ) has resulted in a spectacular x - ray morphology , with emission concentrated both in the nucleus ( at levels of one to two orders of magnitudes higher than typically seen in normal spirals ) and extended along their minor axes to scales of up to @xmath5 10 kpc .",
    "m82 and ngc 253 have been extensively studied in x - rays , with data from the _ einstein _ hri ( watson , stanger , & griffiths 1984 ; fabbiano & trinchieri 1984 ) , _ rosat _ hri ( bregman , schulman , & tomisaka 1995 ) and _ exosat _ le ( schaaf _ et al .",

    "_ 1990 ) and _ bbxrt _ ( petre 1994 ) suggest a complex spectrum with at least two components , although the statistics , spectral resolution , and/or bandpass were somewhat limited with these instruments .",
    "these studies have suggested that the nuclear x - ray emission is due to an extended component probably consisting of the emission of unresolved supernovae ( sn ) and sn - heated ism , and individual point sources which are likely to be very luminous x - ray binaries and young supernova ( sn ) or possibly even a hidden agn .",
    "these studies also suggest that the `` plumes '' breaking out of their galactic disks are evidence for sn - driven `` superwinds '' ( heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) based on the observed temperatures and luminosities .",
    "inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of the large ir flux ( @xmath10 ; telesco 1988 ) by relativistic electrons has also been suggested as a significant contributor to the x - ray flux ( rieke _ et al . _ 1980 ; schaaf _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; moran & lehnert 1996 ) , a view ( possibly ) supported by the detection of mev emission in the vicinity of ngc 253 ( bhattacharya _ et al .",
    "however , the expected intensity of the ic component is subject to large uncertainties depending on model assumptions ( see  4 ) .",
    "the significant spatial and spectral complexity suggests that proper deconvolution of the spectra would require good spatial _ and _ spectral resolution .",
    "here we present high - quality spectra of m82 and ngc 253 in the 0.4 - 10.0 kev bandpass obtained by the x - ray satellite _ asca _ which carries the first imaging , medium - resolution x - ray spectrometers .",
    "although the spatial resolution of _ asca _ is inferior to that of _ rosat _ , _ asca _ can constrain the source of the x - ray emission to within @xmath11 , while previous detectors with significant effective area above 2 kev were essentially non - imaging ( although _ bbxrt _ allowed for some crude spatial analysis ) .",
    "we show below that the spectra are indeed complex , showing strong line emission and requiring multiple components .",
    "m82 was observed by _ asca _ ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) on may 19 , 1993 and ngc 253",
    "was observed on june 10 , 1993 .",
    "briefly , _ asca _ consists of two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ; hereafter s0 and s1 ) with an approximate bandpass of 0.4 - 10.0 kev and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ; hereafter s2 and s3 ) with an approximate bandpass of 0.8 - 10.0 kev .",
    "the sis observations were done in 4-ccd mode although only the data from s0 chips 1 and 2 and s1 chips 0 and 3 ( containing most of the source counts ) were used in the present analysis .",
    "times of high background were excluded and hot pixels ( in the sis data ) were removed . in m82 and ngc 253 ,",
    "most of the extended emission is concentrated within @xmath5 1 of the nucleus ( fabbiano & trinchieri 1984 ; watson , stanger & griffiths 1984 ; bregman , schulman , & tomisaka 1995 ) . in ngc 253 ,",
    "several point sources are clearly present at distances of up to several arcminutes from the nucleus ( see below ) .",
    "accordingly , source counts were extracted from a 6 radius circle centered on the nuclear source in each instrument ( source regions sizes of 3 and 4 are typically chosen for the sis and gis , respectively , in the case of a single point source observation ) .",
    "the background was determined from the remaining counts in the chips beyond 6.5 for the sis , from a 8 - 13 annulus for m82 gis data and from an offset 5 circle for the ngc 253 gis data .",
    "the observed m82 count rates were 0.6 - 1.0 counts s@xmath12 ( per detector ) among the four detectors with net exposure times of @xmath5 17 - 20 ks and the background comprising 4 - 6% of the total . the observed ngc 253 count rates were 0.1 - 0.3 counts s@xmath12 among the four detectors with net exposure times of @xmath5 27 - 30 ks and the background comprising 12 - 19% of the total .",
    "_ rosat _ pspc images of m82 and ngc 253 show that their extended halos are soft ( i.e. , kt @xmath13 kev ) , contributing negligibly in the @xmath14 kev bandpass compared to the x - ray flux originating within the 6 source regions described above . nevertheless , it is possible that the background regions used in extracting the _ asca _ background spectra may be contaminated by the scattering of source photons or , possibly , some ( relatively hard ) non - thermal emission associated with the radio synchrotron halos observed in the halos of m82 and ngc 253 ( c.f . , seaquist & odegard 1991 ; carilli _ et al .",
    "the gis spectra are particularly vulnerable to these effects given the poorer spatial resolution and higher sensitivity above 2 kev of the gis relative to the sis .",
    "however , we find that the counting rate in our background regions are consistent with spectra extracted from blank sky fields .",
    "substituting the blank sky background spectra for the background spectra described above does not significantly affect any of the spectral results discussed below .",
    "the telescope response was calculated assuming most of the counts within 6 are consistent with a point source ( i.e. , a source extent of @xmath4 1 ) .",
    "we went to some considerable effort in investigating the effect of neglecting the spatial complexity on the spectral analysis and these results are described in the appendix .",
    "we find that neglecting the spatial complexity does not have a siginificant impact on our results .",
    "the spectra were binned to a minimum of 10 counts per bin to allow use of the @xmath15 statistic .",
    "the sis spectra strongly rule out a single - component model from 0.4 - 10.0 kev , with both power - law and raymond - smith plasma fits resulting in @xmath16 for both sources .",
    "the poorer spectral resolution and response ( at low energies ) of the gis allow for a single - component model .",
    "indeed , most of the contribution to @xmath17 in the sis fits results from narrow features below @xmath5 2.5 kev . this can be seen in figure 1 which shows the ratio of data to best - fitting power - law model , with the location of expected k@xmath18 line emission from the he- and h - like ions of o , ne , mg , si , s , ca and fe and the l - shell emission of fe marked .",
    "the prominence of he - like mg , si and s lines implies a thermal component with kt @xmath4 2 kev ( c.f . , mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord 1985 ) .",
    "accordingly we tried fitting two - component models to the spectra , with a raymond - smith model to account for the soft ( @xmath19 2 kev ) flux and a raymond - smith or power - law component for the hard ( @xmath20 2 kev ) flux .",
    "these models resulted in acceptable fits for both ngc 253 and m82 , although the sis - only m82 fits resulted in @xmath21 which can be rejected at a level of @xmath2299% ( note that this neglects any systematic error ) .",

    "the double raymond - smith model gives a better fit to the m82 spectra while the raymond - smith plus power - law model gives a better fit to the ngc 253 spectra , although the differences in @xmath17 between the double raymond - smith and raymond - smith plus power - law models are statistically insignificant .",
    "the hard and soft components appear to be absorbed well in excess of the galactic columns ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 for ngc 253 and m82 , respectively ; stark _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , although not at a high statistical significance .",
    "the soft - component temperatures are similar ( @xmath5 0.6 and 0.8 kev , for m82 and ngc 253 , respectively , insensitive to the choice of hard - component continuum ) while the hard component appears to be somewhat harder in m82 ( @xmath61 1.8 or kt @xmath5 11 kev ) than in ngc 253 ( @xmath61 2.0 or kt @xmath5 7 kev ) .",
    "if the hard component is thermal , the abundance ( inferred from a raymond - smith model ) is constrained to be significantly sub - solar ( @xmath4 0.2 and @xmath4 0.5 in ngc 253 and m82 , respectively ) , based primarily on the lack of a strong fe - k line at 6.7 - 6.9 kev . in ngc 253 no ( narrow ) fe - k line emission is detected , and we set a 90% confidence upper - limit ( for two additional parameters , the energy and normalization of the line ) of @xmath5 180 ev for the ew of any line emission in the four - instrument raymond - smith plus power - law fit . in m82 , the addition of a narrow line at @xmath62 kev with an ew of @xmath7 ev to the four - instrument raymond - smith plus power - law fit reduces @xmath15 by @xmath63 , significant at a level of @xmath64 for two additional parameters . the raymond - smith plus power - law fits to the m82 and ngc 253 data are shown in figure 2 .    in m82 the soft - component abundances ( for the s0 - 3 raymond - smith plus power - law fit ) relative to solar were found to be : n @xmath65 , o = @xmath66 , ne = @xmath67 , mg = @xmath68 , si = @xmath69 , s = @xmath70 , fe = @xmath71 .",
    "the ar , ca , and ni abundances were tied together ( due to limited signal - to - noise ) resulting in a mean value of @xmath72 .",
    "note that the fe abundance inferred from the soft - component model is determined solely based on fe - l emission , not fe - k , due to the dominance of the hard component above @xmath5 2 kev .",
    "we note that these abundances were derived assuming that the soft component is _ entirely thermal_. the poorer signal - to - noise of the ngc 253 data do not warrant allowing the elemental abundances to vary independently .",
    "o , mg , si , and s , which show strong line emission in figure 1 , were grouped together , and ne and fe - l , which are not resolved from each other , were grouped separately .",
    "the resulting abundances were n , ar , ca , ni @xmath4 0.66 ; o , mg , si , s = @xmath73 and ne , fe = @xmath74 . as in m82 , these results are suggestive of a depression of fe abundance relative to o , mg , si and s.    the somewhat high value of @xmath15 resulting from the sis - only fits to the m82 data ( see table 1 ) suggests that a third component may be required .",
    "relative minima in @xmath15 space are present in the m82 fits when the soft - component temperature and @xmath75 are varied .",
    "this results in a highly assymmetric confidence interval for the temperature ( see table 1 ) . in the case of @xmath75 , the required difference in @xmath15",
    "is reached before the onset of the new minima , giving the lower limit shown in table 1 , however the `` true '' lower limit on @xmath75 may be zero .",
    "this behavior also suggests the presence of an additional component , with a lower temperature than that of the soft component .",
    "the addition of a third thermal component to the double raymond - smith model substantially improves the m82 fits , resulting in temperatures of 0.35 kev , 1.07 kev and 12.4 kev ( see tsuru _",
    "et al . _ , 1997 for a discussion of three - component raymond - smith and non - equilibrium plasma fits to the m82 spectra ) . adding an additional thermal component to the double raymond - smith ngc 253 model reduced @xmath17 by only 8.3 for 2 additional degrees of freedom ( kt and normalization , with @xmath76 fixed at the galactic value and the abundances tied to the t @xmath77 k component abundances ) , significant only at the @xmath78 level .",

    "we plot the abundances relative to fe ( x / fe ) derived from various fits to the m82 data .",
    "in addition to the m82 fits in table 1 and the triple raymond - smith model discussed above , these fits include substituting the mewe - kaastra - liedahl plasma model ( ` mekal ' in xspec ) for the raymond - smith plasma model in the raymond - smith plus power law model , a power - law distribution of temperatures model , a double raymond - smith plus power - law model , and including an additional ( very steep ) power - law in the triple raymond - smith model . while these fits result in abundances that are",

    "( indicating that the soft - component continuum is poorly constrained ) , figure 3 shows that the _ relative _ abundances are somewhat more robust , with most varying by less than a factor of @xmath5 5 , although the relative abundances of ar , ca and ni are poorly constrained .",
    "note that these errors are still somewhat larger than the statistical errors discussed above , showing that systematic errors dominate .",
    "these systematic errors are most likley dominated by differences in the slope of the continuum across the line - emitting energies in each fit .",
    "a comparison of the raymond - smith and the mewe - kaastra - liedahl models in xspec for a 0.6 kev , solar - abundance plasma shows that , with the exeption of an oxygen line at @xmath79 kev present in the raymond - smith model but not in the mekal model , most of the differences between the two models are on the order of 30% or less , implying that uncertainties in atomic physics are likely to be much less significant than the statistical errors in these data .",

    "_ 1990 , tsuru _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) although any interpretation of this result must be viewed with caution given the large ( 1  by 2 ) _ ginga _ fov ( however , the fact that the m82 observation was performed in a scanning mode reduces the uncertainty in flux ) .",
    "while two and three - component models describe the data well , the true situation , particularly for the soft component below @xmath5 2 kev , is likely to be a distribution of temperatures .",
    "for example , the rosat pspc data from both m82 and ngc 253 suggest temperatures of @xmath5 10@xmath85 k in their disk and nuclear regions , with the temperature decreasing with radius out in the halos ( i.e. , beyond @xmath5 1 kpc ) , as discussed in strickland , ponman , & stevens ( 1996 ) and dahlem , heckman & weaver ( 1996 ) . in ngc 253 , the soft ( @xmath4 2 kev ) component is apparently dominated by a disk and nuclear thermal component with kt @xmath5 0.8 kev . in m82",
    ", on the other hand , the soft component appears to have approximately equal contributions from @xmath5 1.1 kev gas in the nuclear and disk regions and @xmath5 0.4 kev gas in the halo , which is fit reasonably well by a 0.8 kev thermal model .",
    "the luminosities , pressures , masses and energetics implied by the best - fitting soft - component model parameters are consistent with recent models of starburst - driven winds ( tomisaka & bregman 1993 ; suchkov _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , although the details of this kind of analysis are sensitive to assumptions concerning the volume , filling factor , and possibly the outflow velocity of the gas associated with each component .",
    "for example , the outflow velocity of the x - ray emitting gas in m82 may be as high as 1000 - 3000 km s@xmath12 ( seaquist & odegard 1991 ) although the outflow velocity of molecular gas in m82 is estimated to be less than 500 km s@xmath12 ( nakai _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) . to estimate the contribution of sn to the observed thermal flux we assume that the ism heating is dominated by type - ii sn , and that each supernova ejects @xmath86 with @xmath87 ergs of kinetic energy ( c.f .",
    ", suchkov _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . with these assumptions , _ independent of the assumed volume v and filling factor _ , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the mass of gas ejected by sn ( i.e. , individual sn and the superwind ) , @xmath90 is the total x - ray emitting mass , @xmath91 is the mass ejected by a typical sn in units of @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the outflow velocity in units of @xmath94 .",
    "we estimate ( with @xmath91 = 1 and @xmath93 = 1 ) that @xmath95 for the 1.1 kev and 0.8 kev gas ( for m82 and ngc 253 , respectively ) of the soft - component emission . @xmath91 and @xmath93 are likely to be somewhat smaller than @xmath96 , so this implies that a significant amount of the emission is due to ambient ism , possibly `` swept - up '' by the superwind , as suggested by suchkov _",
    "the low absolute abundances implied by some of the models of the soft component may therefore be indicative of low abundances in the ( ambient and swept - up ) disk ism .",
    "this calculation is not appropriate for the @xmath5 0.4 kev halo gas in m82 since energy dissipation is likely to significant out in the halo .",
    "the unusually high values of x / fe shown in figure 3 indicate that the fe abundance is `` suppressed '' , particularly relative to s and si .",
    "the high ir luminosities of m82 and ngc 253 suggest a significant dust distribution in the disk and halo ism of m82 and ngc 253 ( telesco 1988 ) . since fe is depleted in warm ism clouds to a larger extent than s and si ( c.f .",
    ", cowie & songaila 1986 ) , dust depletion may account for some of the fe deficiency , resulting in si / fe and s / fe ratios @xmath5 17% and 130% ( respectively ) _ higher _ than in the undepleted case .",

    "the high absorption ( @xmath97 ) derived from fits to the hard components ( see table 1 ) also suggests that the hard component originates in compact and/or nuclear regions ( note that radio observations of the nuclear regions of both m82 and ngc 253 suggest the presence of molecular gas with similar column densities ; nakai _ et al .",

    "it is therefore likely that gas not in thermal equilibrium or non - thermal emission contribute significantly to the hard components .",
    "the former case would correspond to @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the hard - component emitting region size in kpc , @xmath93 is the velocity of the ejecta ( as defined above ) , and @xmath101 is the pre - shock ambient density ( c.f . ,",

    "the spectra of m82 and ngc 253 are also very similar to the spectra of low - luminosity agn and liners ( serlemitsos , ptak and yaqoob 1996 ) which generally can be described by a raymond - smith plus power - law model .",
    "the power - law slopes obtained from our fits ( @xmath109 ) may suggest a common physical origin , such as an accretion - driven component .",
    "it is likely that some of the point sources in m82 and ngc 253 have masses @xmath110 since it would be unphysical for all of these sources to be emitting at their eddington luminosities most of the time , if they are powered by accretion .",
    "the discovery of ( long - term ) x - ray variability in `` starburst '' galaxy ngc 3628 demonstrates that the x - ray flux from ngc 3628 is dominated by a point source , most likely a massive blackhole candidate or a micro - agn ( dahlem , heckman , fabbiano 1995 ; yaqoob _ et al .",
    "these considerations suggest the possibility that starburst galaxies such as m82 and ngc 253 may harbor blackhole candidates , with masses significantly higher than the masses of blackhole candidates in our galaxy .    the authors wish to thank all of the members of _ asca _ team who have made this work possible .",
    "ap wishes to acknowledge the support of the nasa graduate student research program .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service and the nasa / ipca extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with nasa .",
    "this work will be included in a dissertation to be submitted to the graduate school , university of maryland , in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the ph.d .",
    "degree in physics .",
    "as stated in the text , the x - ray emission in both m82 and ngc 253 is extended while the telescope response was computed assuming it is point - like . in this appendix",
    "we show that properly taking the extended nature of the sources into account does not significantly impact the results of this paper . in x - ray spectral",
    "fitting , the xrt response is taken into account by the creation of a table of effective area as a function of energy , which is then used to convert the observed counting rate in each spectral bin to a flux .",
    "this table , hereafter referred to as an arf ( ancillary response file ) , also applies a correction for the counts scattered out of the source region ( 6 circular regions were used for both the sis and gis in this paper ) .",
    "first , we describe the `` standard '' procedure used for the creation of an arf appropriate for a point source .",
    "the telescope point - spread function ( psf ) is summed over the source region to determine percentage of source photons contained in the source region .",
    "the psf sum is then multiplied by the telescope effective area .",
    "the psf and effective area are functions of both energy and the off - axis angle of the source .",
    "both the psf and effective area are interpolated from values contained in calibration look - up tables , computed using a monte - carlo procedure based on a raytracing program .",
    "although the xrt psf has a cross - like shape , the calibration tables contain azimuthally - averaged values , an approach that is usually a good approximation as long as most of the source counts lie in a symmetric ( and preferably circular ) region .",
    "the mirrors contain a heat shield , made up of a thin plastic film , to protect against temperature gradients , and the computed effective area is reduced to take photon losses through the shield into account .",
    "the gas cell of the gis contains a beryllium window held in place by a supporting grid , and transmission through the grid and be must also be taken into account .",
    "note that the thicknesses of both the grid and be vary across the gis detectors .",
    "also , unlike the sis , the gis introduce a broadening of the psf .",
    "the instrumental psf of the gis is approximately a gaussian whose fwhm @xmath111 arcminutes , with the addition of a `` tail '' at energies @xmath112 kev .",
    "accordingly , the xrt psf is modified by the grid and be transmission and then convolved with the gis psf , which is modeled by the sum of two - dimensional gaussians .",
    "hereafter , we refer to arfs computed with this approach as standard arfs .",
    "there are two ways in which standard arfs may be inappropriate for an extended source .",
    "first , more source counts would be scattered out of the source region than is the case for a point source . not taking this into account would result in an underestimate of the source flux .",
    "second , by definition , an extended source subtends a distribution of off - axis angles , so determining the xrt effective area and psf for a single off - axis angle may be incorrect .",
    "because both the effective area and psf have an energy dependence , the spectral results may be affected as well as the flux estimates . because the x - ray emission from m82 and ngc 253 is relatively compact and weak , it is likely that statistical errors will dominate that the effects described above , with the possible exception that the fluxes may be underestimated . to check this in detail",
    ", we adopted a monte - carlo approach . as is the case in the point - source procedure",
    ", we divided the bandpasses of the sis and gis into the same number of energy bins as is used in the spectral fitting , namely 1180 in the case of the sis and 201 in the case of the gis . for each bin",
    "at least 10000 photons were raytraced through the mirror ( the raytracing code was developed by peter serlemitsos during the design of the _ asca _ mirrors , and , when azimuthally - averaged , is in good agreement with the look - up tables described above and the radial profile of an _ asca _ pv phase observation of 3c 273 ) .",
    "the position ( on the sky ) of each photon was chosen at random from _ rosat _ pspc images of m82 and ngc 253 , weighted by the intensity at each pixel .",
    "this approach results in photons incident on the xrt with a distribution in off - axis angles consistent with those expected from the pspc images .",
    "a 12 by 12 image was used for m82 and a 10 by 10 image was used for ngc 253 .",
    "the bandpass of each image was limited to @xmath113 kev , and the background was _ not _ subtracted , in order to conservatively overestimate the source extent ( note that the source extent is also overestimated since the _ rosat _ pspc psf is not removed with this procedure , although the _ rosat _ psf fwhm is @xmath114 , somewhat smaller than the _ asca _ xrt psf fwhm of @xmath115 ) .    in the case of the gis ,",
    "the instrumental psf was introduced by adding `` noise '' ( i.e. , gaussian random deviates ) to the raytraced photon positions .",
    "the standard deviations of the deviates were computed with the same algorithm used in the standard arf procedure .",
    "also in the case of the gis , photons were rejected to account for the grid and be transmission ( i.e. , a photon was rejected if a uniform deviate exceeded the product of the be and grid transmission at the photon s position ) . the percentage of photons `` detected '' in the source region , reduced by the thermal shield transmission ( as is done in the point source case ) ,",
    "was then multiplied by the geometrical area of the mirror to derive an effective area .",
    "hereafter , we refer to arfs computed with this procedure as `` raytraced '' ( although , as stated above , the `` standard '' arf procedure also _ indirectly _ involves raytracing , in the computation of the look - up tables ) .",
    "initially , arfs were raytraced assuming that m82 and ngc 253 are point sources for comparison with the standard arfs used in the fits given in the text .",
    "the ratio of the raytraced arfs to the standards arfs , shown in the top panel of figure 6 for the case of the m82 s0 and s2 arfs , gives the systematic differences between the two procedures described above .",
    "the largest source of discrepancy between the two methods is due to differences in the raytracing code used here and the raytracing used to produce the look - up tables , particularly in the choice of optical constants for gold ( the reflecting material used in the xrt ) .",
    "other sources of discrepancy are inherent to the procedures employed , i.e. , the xrt psf is not azimuthally - averaged in the raytraced case .",
    "the top panel of figure 6 shows that , with the exception of a sharp peak around the au m edge at 2.2 kev , the two procedures are in agreement below 4 kev to within 10% . above 4 kev there is a broad `` hump '' in the ratio plot which peaks at a level of @xmath116 .",
    "these are issues which are currently being resolved by the instrument teams and will be reported in a future issue of _",
    "ascanews_. for comparison , the statistical errors in the asca data below 4 kev are typically on the order of 6% in the case of m82 and 10% in the case of ngc 253 .",
    "as is evident in figure 2 , the statistical errors become somewhat larger above 4 kev since both the xrt and instrumental responses and the source fluxes drop off rapidly above 4 kev , particularly in the case of ngc 253 which has a steeper spectrum than m82 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 6 shows that ratio of arfs produced with the raytracing procedure for an extended source ( with photons selected from the pspc image , as described above ) and a point - source ( raytraced arfs were computed in both cases to remove the discrepancy between the raytraced and standard arfs ) in the case of the m82 sis0 ( solid line ) and gis2 ( dashed line ) arfs .",
    "note that the extended nature of the source only impacts the overall normalization below @xmath117 kev , and results in a gradual drop off in net effective area above 4 kev ( a result of the larger energy dependence of the xrt psf and effective area above 4 kev ) .",
    "note that this drop in effective area partially offsets the `` hump '' above 4 kev noted above .",
    "indeed , in the case of ngc 253 , repeating the four - instrument raymond - smith plus power - law fit with the extended source arfs results in best - fitting parameters that are essentially identical to those discussed in the text where the standard arfs were used ( i.e. , the statistical errors dominate any systematic errors ) .",
    "when the double raymond - smith fit to the m82 data is repeated with the extended - source arfs , the soft component parameters do not change significantly , although the inferred 0.5 - 2.0 kev flux is increased by @xmath118 . because our procedure deliberately overestimates the source extent ,",
    "this is a conservative upper limit to the 0.5 - 2.0 kev flux from m82 . on the other hand , the hard component",
    "spectral parameters are modified slightly when extended - source arfs are used , with the best - fitting @xmath75 decreasing by @xmath119 , the temperature increasing by @xmath96 kev and the abundance increasing from @xmath120 solar to @xmath121 solar .",
    "nevertheless , these parameters are still well within the statistical errors quoted in the text . as with the soft component ,",
    "the extended - source fits suggest that the 2 - 10 kev flux , dominated by the hard component , may be underestimated by @xmath122",
    ". however , tsuru _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) report that the flux associated with the hard component in m82 is not resolved by _",
    "recomputing the extended - source arfs by selecting the soft - component photons from the pspc image and assuming that the hard component is point - like eliminates the changes in the hard - component fit parameters , and results in a 2 - 10 kev flux @xmath123 _ lower _ than that inferred from the standard arf fits ( this is not surprising since , as shown in the top panel of figure 6 , the raytraced point - source arf gives a larger effective area at high energies than the standard arfs ) .",
    "thus , the only parameter significantly affected by properly computing the response of _ asca _ to an extended source is the 0.5 - 2.0 kev flux inferred for m82 , which does not impact any of the conclusions of this paper .",
