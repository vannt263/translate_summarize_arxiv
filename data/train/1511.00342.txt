    "reducing the parameters would lead to mismatch of the physical degree of freedom and thus give rise to unreliable results , the physical properties may deviate not only quantitatively but also qualitatively . for an example , assuming @xmath182 or imposing @xmath178 can reduce the parameter number by 2 .",
    "however , as shown in fig.[fig - paramtnecessity ] , without mentioning the quantitative deviations , an incorrect cusp behavior appears in the energy @xmath38 at low frequencies as illustrated at @xmath179 , and even worse , a spurious jump emerges in the tunneling ( spin flipping ) strength @xmath118 around @xmath49 .",
    "the other physical quantities , such as the mean photon number @xmath116 , the coupling correlation @xmath117 also have a false discontinuity similar to @xmath118 .",

    "it is worthwhile to see that this simple extension for the excited states has already yielded some considerable improvements in strong couplings as illustrated in fig.[fig - excited ] for a number of lowest energy levels . with the above expressions , one",
    "may further analytically construct an improved extension of the variational energy for overall coupling range by imposing the deformed polaron and antipolaron in the grwa form of wavefunction . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamics of the system also can be calculated in terms of @xmath196 which provides the intra - overlap and inter - overlap of the deformed polarons and antipolarons with different oscillator quantum number @xmath197 . since here",
    "the focus is the ground state which , as we show in the present work , already has rich underlying physics to be uncovered , we shall present a more detailed method description and systematical discussion for the excited state properties in our future work .",
    "in the variation of the coupling strength , the system undergoes a phase - transition - like changeover around @xmath198 . in the super - strong tunneling or low - frequency limit ,",
    "i.e. @xmath199 this changeover is very sharp , it behaves more like a phase transition , as discussed by ashhab @xcite . in the other cases it behaves like a crossover .",
    "we can get more insights into this transition - like behavior from the profile deformation of the wavepacket .",
    "the increase of the coupling strength is splitting the wavepacket into the polaron and the antipolaron , while the tunneling is trying to keep them as close as possible in the groundstate . before a full",
    "splitting the system remains in a quadpolaron state with four channels of tunneling , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , while after the splitting the system enters a bipolaron state with only two tunneling channels , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , surviving .",

    "as mentioned in appendix [ app - a ] , imposing symmetric polaron and antipolaron would lead to a spurious discontinuous behavior of physical properties , such as the tunneling strength , around @xmath49 at low frequencies , while in reality it should be smooth as predicted by asymmetric polaron and antipolaron in agreement with exact numerics .",
    "also , in the strong coupling regime the displacement asymmetry of the polaron and the antipolaron actually plays an important role in inducing the amplitude - squeezing effect ( @xmath229 ) which extends the wavepackets of the polaron and the antipolaron to increase their overlap , thus enhancing the tunneling . without the asymmetry",

    "still , as afore - mentioned , @xmath237 is obtained in low - frequency semiclassical limit , while the situations at finite frequencies would be different .",
    "the controversy essentially comes from the fact that a consensus on the nature of the interaction - induced variation in different frequencies is still lacking . here",

    "in fact , in the low frequency limit the photon number vanishes for the ground state below @xmath49 , as indicated by fig.[fig - phyquan]b ( this is more obvious for lower frequencies ) , so that additionally the total parity symmetry can be decomposed into separate spin reversal symmetry @xmath311 and oscillator spatial reversal symmetry @xmath312 .",
    "these additional symmetries are broken beyond @xmath49 due to the emergence of a number of photons , so that there is a subsymmetry transition when the system goes across @xmath49 .",
    "still , these spin and spatial subsymmetries are considered from the weak coupling side and become less valid at finite frequencies due to a nonvanishing photon number .",
    "nevertheless , our finding of the scaling relation provides compensation but from the strong coupling side .",
    "actually , as shown in fig.4 , the physical quantity we proposed , @xmath98 , demonstrates an invariant behavior beyond @xmath49 , which confirms the scaling relation and thus the symmetric aspect between the displacement and frequency renormalizations in this regime .",
    "note that , as shown in last subsection , in this bipolaron regime the remaining left - left and right - right tunnelings ( i.e. polaron - antipolaron inter - tunnelings ) render both the polaron and the antipolaron to have finite weights , while to preserve finite weights as a quantum effect in the absence of left - right tunneling channels ( i.e. intra - polaron and intra - antipolaron tunnelings ) the polaron and the antipolaron have to maintain the displacement - frequency scaling relation . in other words ,",
    "this displacement - frequency symmetry arises only in the absence of the left - right channels , and conversely , there will be no left - right channels if the symmetry is preserved there .",
    "going from the bipolaron regime to the quadpolaron regime , this symmetry will be broken in the presence of the left - right tunneling channels . in this sense , besides the afore - mentioned parity subsymmetry breaking originating from the weak coupling side in the low frequency limit , for both low frequency limit and finite frequencies there is another hidden symmetry - breaking - like behavior in the changeover of the two quantum states stemming from the strong coupling side .",
    "thus , it is interesting to see a deeper nature of the interaction that not only induces the bipolaron / quadpolaron quantum state changeover but also brings about the symmetry breaking .",
    "in the two - mode case .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "our variational method ( solid line ) is in good agreement with exact numerics(dots ) . ]",
    "our ground - state phase diagram obtained for the rabi model might also provide some insights or implications for the spin - boson model @xcite which is a multiple - mode version of the rabi model and has wide relevance to other fields , including the kondo model @xcite and the ising spin chain @xcite in condensed matter .",
    "on the one hand , the bipolaron / quadpolaron changeover in the rabi model can provide insights for localized / delocalized transition in the spin - boson model .",
    "in fact , the spin - boson model exhibits different behaviors in the ohmic , super - ohmic , and sub - ohmic spectra , which actually have different weights of distributions for low and high frequency modes .",
    "note that , as discussed in our work on the nature of the interaction - induced variation , the bipolaron and the quadpolaron states respectively have blockaded and enhanced left - right tunnelings , which is closely related to the situation of the localized and delocalized states involved in the spin - boson model . as indicated by our ground - state phase diagram and the obtained @xmath49 expression ,",
    "the same coupling could be located in different regimes depending on whether frequency is low or high .",
    "our ground - state phase diagram and @xmath49 expression might provide a primary reference and some insights into the different behaviours of the ohmic , super - ohmic , and sub - ohmic spectra , since the distribution weights of low and high frequencies would make different contributions to blockaded and enhanced tunneling , thus affecting the competition in the quantum phase transition of the localized and delocalized states .",
    "on the other hand , the overweighted antipolaron region might have some implication for the coherence - incoherence transition in the spin - boson model .",
    "it has been found that , within the delocalized phase of the spin - boson model , there is possibly another coherence - incoherence transition @xcite for which the nature is still not very clear .",
    "interestingly , in our ground - state phase diagram of the rabi model , within the strong - tunneling regime in the quadpolaron state , there is also an underlying particular region characterized by an unexpected overweighted antipolaron , the possible implication and relation of the overweighted antipolaron regime in the rabi model and the coherence - incoherence transition in the spin - boson model might be worthwhile exploring .    since in the present work our focus is on the single - mode rabi model , we would like to leave the investigations of these possible implications for the spin - boson model to some future works .",
    "nevertheless , in the following we provide some indication of the method and variational wavefunction .",
    "the basic variational physical ingredients introduced in the single - mode case also should apply for the multiple - mode case .",
    "the treatments are readily extendable from the single - mode case .",
    "the hamiltonian including @xmath315 modes of harmonic oscillators can be written as @xmath316 we propose the variational trial wavefunction as @xmath317=\\alpha \\prod_{k=1}^m\\varphi _",

    "the energy is simply that of the single - mode energy in with the overlap integrals replaced by the product of all modes .",
    "we find the same accuracy as in the single - mode case , as illustrated in fig.[fig-2modes ] by an example of the two - mode case , for which exact numerics are available for comparison .",
    "one can also include a bias term @xmath321 with a broken parity for @xmath322 at different spin @xmath323 .",

    "<S> introduction. _ in the past decade , it has been witnessed that the exploration of fundamental quantum physics in light - matter coupling systems has significantly evolved toward the ( ultra-)strong coupling regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in 2004 , the strong coupling of a single microwave photon to a superconducting qubit was realized experimentally by using circuit quantum electrodynamics @xcite . in 2010 , </S>",
    "<S> this coupling rate was enhanced to reach a considerable fraction up to 12% of the cavity transition frequency@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even with such small fractions the system has already entered into so - called ultrastrong - coupling limit@xcite . in this situation , </S>",
    "<S> the well - known jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model@xcite is no longer applicable because the jc model is valid only in the cases of near resonance and weak coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the experimentally observed anticrossing in the cavity transmission spectra @xcite was due to counter - rotating terms , which are dropped in the jc model as a rotating - wave approximation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , experimental observation of the bloch - siegert shift @xcite also requires taking into account the counter - rotating terms in the description of the jc model . </S>",
    "<S> thus the importance of the counter - rotating terms raises requests to comprehend the behavior of a full quantum rabi model @xcite ( qrm ) for all regimes of the coupling strengths @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , an important progress in the study of the qrm in the past years is the proof of its integrability @xcite . as a result , its energy spectra </S>",
    "<S> have been exactly obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , to calculate the dynamics of the system , correlation functions , and even other simpler physical observables , it is not enough to know only the exact eigenvalues , but the wavefunctions ( e.g. , the exact eigenstates ) are desirable . </S>",
    "<S> based on series expansions of the eigenstates in terms of known basis sets , it was realized that a standard calculation with double precision , sufficient to compute the spectrum , fails for the eigenstates@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the challenge to formulate an exact wave function in a general case still hampers access to a full understanding of the qrm .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> by deforming the polaron and antipolaron @xcite we propose a novel variational wavefunction ansatz to extract the ground state physics of the qrm . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that this ansatz is valid with high accuracy in all regimes of the coupling strengths . </S>",
    "<S> thus a ground state phase diagram of the qrm is constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the system variation , by increasing the coupling strength from weak to strong , becomes transparent in the ground - state phase diagram with a quantum state changeover from quadpolaron to bipolaron , around a novel critical - like coupling scale analytically extracted . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an unexpected overweighted antipolaron is revealed in the quadpolaron state and a hidden scaling behavior is found in the bipolaron state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we propose an experimentally accessible parameter to test these states . for perspective </S>",

    "<S> apparently , @xmath33 define two bare polarons @xcite in the sense that the harmonic oscillator is bound by @xmath34 due to the coupling @xmath35 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> these two polarons form two bare potential wells but the existence of the level splitting @xmath7 ( resulting in the tunneling between these two wells@xcite ) makes the model difficult to solve analytically .    </S>",
    "<S> let us begin with the wave - function @xmath36 satisfying the schrdinger equation @xmath37 with the eigenenergy @xmath38 . </S>",

    "<S> without loss of generality , here we consider the ground state , with negative parity . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an additional effective potential originating from the tunneling , as shown in the lower panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b . </S>",
    "<S> the additional potential will deform the bare potential and as a result creates a subwell in the opposite direction of the bare potential @xmath47 , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c . </S>",
    "<S> the subwell induces an _ antipolaron _ as a quantum effect . the above analysis from potential subwell verifies the existence of antipolaron from wavefunction expansion@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the polaron and antipolaron constitute the basic ingredients of the ground - state wavefunction .    _ deformed polaron and antipolaron. _ with the concept of polaron and antipolaron in hand </S>",
    "<S> , the competition between different energy scales @xmath48 and @xmath35 involved in the qrm will inevitably lead to deformations of the polaron and antipolaron . </S>",
    "<S> physically , they can deform predominantly in two possible ways : the position is shifted and the frequency is renormalized , which will introduce four independent variational parameters given below . </S>",
    "<S> explicit deformation depends on the coupling strength once the tunneling is fixed , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] d - f from weak to strong couplings according to a critical - like coupling strength @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a trial variational wave - function for @xmath50 takes the superposition of the deformed polaron ( @xmath51 ) and antipolaron ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 being the ground - state of standard harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath18 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , describes the renormalization for frequency ( displacement ) independently for the polaron and the antipoalron , while the coefficients of @xmath61 and @xmath60 denote their weights , subject to the normalization condition @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that in contrast to the direct expansion on basis series without frequency renormalization @xcite , we design our trial wavefunction based on the dominant physics of deformation .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that our variational wavefunction is capable of providing a reliable analysis on the qrm in the whole parameter regime , ranging from weak to strong couplings , as shown for several physical quantities for the ground - state including the energy , the mean photon number , the coupling correlation and the tunneling strength in appendix [ app - a ] . </S>",
    "<S> obviously the remarkable agreement between our results and the exact ones roots in the fact that our trial wavefunction correctly captures the basic physics , as illustrated by the accurate wavefunction profiles compared to the exact numerical ones for various couplings in fig.[fig - mechanism]a . </S>",
    "<S> the variational wavefunction , with its concise physical ingredients and its accuracy , in turn facilitates unveiling more underlying physics .    , at @xmath63 respectively , for weak ( green ) , intermediate(navy ) , and strong(red ) couplings , with @xmath64 . </S>",

    "<S> it is clear that @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> * e * , schematic illustration of the physics for the overweighted antipolaron . when decreasing the coupling strength @xmath35 , the potential provided by the left - displaced oscillator for the antipolaron gets lower , so the tunneling energy gain from large @xmath71 in * d * overwhelms the potential cost , which favors a larger weight of antipolaron . </S>",
    "<S> * f * , the overweighted antipolaron with a larger weight than the polaron . ]    _ quadpolaron / bipolaron quantum state changeover. _ from fig.[fig - mechanism]a - c one sees that when increasing the coupling , the wavepacket splits into visible polaron and antipolaron ( see animated plots in supplementary material for more vivid evolutions of potentials and wavepackets ) . before the full splitting , there are significant tunnelings in all the four channels between the polarons and antipolarons , as schematically shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]e . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this sense we call this state a _ quadpolaron_. after the splitting , only two same - side channels of tunneling survives while the left - right channels are blocked gradually by the increasing barrier , as sketched in fig . </S>",

    "<S> this enables us to obtain an analytic coupling scale ( see appendix [ app - b ] ) , @xmath72 , which generalizes the low frequency - limit result@xcite @xmath73 and correctly captures the quantum state changeover between quadpolaron and bipolaron for the whole range of frequencies .    . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig - parameters ] shows three types of distinct behaviors of the variational parameters in three different frequency regimes : high frequency ( @xmath82 ) , intermediate frequency(@xmath83 $ ] ) , and low frequency ( @xmath84 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result is understandable due to the fact that the antipolaron always has a higher potential energy owing to its opposite direction to the displacement of @xmath3 . roughly speaking , at a high frequency </S>",
    "<S> , the antipolaron should have a lower weight than the polaron ( @xmath85 ) since the antipolaron is suppressed by the high potential . at a low frequency , the polaron benefits from both potential and tunneling energies . </S>",
    "<S> however , competition becomes subtle at an intermediate frequency as each of these different energy scales may only favor either the polaron or the antipolaron respectively , which may lead to overweighted antipolaron , as shown in fig.[fig - parameters]e .    </S>",
    "<S> below we give a more explicit analysis . actually , the four channel tunneling energies in the quadpolaron are proportional to the overlaps of the polarons and antipolarons , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , as shown in fig.[fig - mechanism]d </S>",

    "<S> , the antipolarons have larger overlap than the polarons , i.e. @xmath92 ( see fig . [ fig - mechanism]d ) . </S>",
