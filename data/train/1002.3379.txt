    "luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) are descendants of massive o stars which are nearing the end of core hydrogen burning .",
    "the extremely high luminosities of these stars ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) place them near or above the eddington limit , resulting in large variability amplitudes and violent mass ejections . as heavy mass - loss ensues , the outer layers of hydrogen are lost , exposing deeper layers of the star , at which point these objects evolve into wolf - rayet stars ( langer et al .",
    "lbvs are extremely rare ; only @xmath010 have been confirmed in the milky way .",
    "some known galactic lbvs include p cygni , @xmath6 car , ag car , lbv 1806@xmath120 , the pistol star , and qf362 .",
    "the latter two lbvs reside within the quintuplet starburst cluster near the galactic center ( figer et al .",
    "1995 ; geballe et al .",
    "2000 ) , and their presence among @xmath7100 o stars and dozens of more highly evolved , coeval wolf ",
    "rayet stars in the cluster provides insight as to how lbvs fit into the overall picture of massive star evolution . in this letter",
    ", we report on the discovery of an lbv lying near the quintuplet cluster , which we will refer to as lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 , based on its galactic coordinates .",
    "lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 was highlighted following a paschen-@xmath2 ( p@xmath2 ) narrowband imaging survey of the galactic center region ( wang et al .",
    "2010 ) , performed with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) .",
    "the survey covered a total projected area of 2253 pc@xmath8 in 144 orbits of observations .",
    "the nic3 camera was utilized and narrowband images were obtained through the f187n ( line ) and f190n ( continuum ) filters .",
    "dozens of unidentified point sources of p@xmath2 line excess were discovered in the survey area , including lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 .",
    "recent spectroscopic identifications of other p@xmath2 emission - line stars will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 was immediately recognized as an intriguing object , owing to the large p@xmath2 excess measured for this star , which is comparable to , but exceeds that of the pistol star , and its close proximity to the quintuplet starburst cluster .",
    "the position and photometry of the central point source is presented in table 1 , along with data for the other quintuplet lbvs qf362 and the pistol star for comparison .",
    "the @xmath9 photometry included in table 1 is from the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog ( cutri et al . 2003 ) , and the date of the 2mass measurements was julian day ( jd ) 2451825.4954 .",
    "another remarkable feature of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 is the circular nebula of p@xmath2 emission surrounding it , shown in figure 1 .",
    "the nebula has an angular radius of @xmath0200 , and has no counterpart in the adjacent f190n continuum , which indicates that the emission is entirely from the p@xmath2 transition .",
    "a @xmath3-band spectrum of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 was obtained on 2008 may 15 , using the 4.1 m anglo - australian telescope and the iris2 instrument ( tinney et al .",
    "the sky was clear and the average seeing was 15 .",
    "the slit on iris2 is 1  wide , providing a resolution of @xmath10 in the @xmath3 band .",
    "the telescope was nodded in an abba sequence for sky subtraction and bad - pixel suppression .",
    "the data images were reduced and the spectrum was extracted using the pipeline .",
    "a telluric spectrum was obtained from observations of the a0v star hd155379 , and was applied to the science data using the idl - based program ( vacca et al .",
    "the @xmath3-band spectrum of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 is presented in figure 2 , and has a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath05080 , moving from the red end to the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by br@xmath11 emission at @xmath122.167 , which appears as a p cygni profile .",
    "he i emission is detected at @xmath122.06 and @xmath122.150 .",
    "two weak absorption features of he i might also be detected blueward of the br@xmath11 line .",
    "low - ionization emission features are also present , including mg ii at @xmath122.137 and @xmath122.144 , na i at @xmath122.206 and @xmath122.209 , and relatively strong fe ii emission at @xmath122.089 . weak forbidden emission features of iron ( [ fe ii ] ) are also detected at @xmath122.133 , and perhaps in a blend with he i at @xmath122.043 .",
    "detailed information on the atomic transitions detected in the spectrum and their equivalent widths are presented in table 2 ; line centers and equivalent widths were measured using the routine in . based on the presence and relative strengths of these emission features ,",
    "the spectrum of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 is similar to those of the lbv stars wra 751 , ag car , the pistol star , and the b[e ] star gg car ( morris et al .",
    "1996 ; figer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we used the br@xmath11 p cygni profile to obtain an estimate for the wind velocity of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 .",
    "the absorption trough is centered at @xmath122.1674 and the emission peak is centered at @xmath122.1684 , which implies a wind velocity of @xmath0140 km s@xmath13 .",
    "this value is comparable to the wind velocities derived for the pistol star and qf362 , which have terminal values of @xmath0105 km s@xmath13 and @xmath0170 km s@xmath13 , respectively ( najarro et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , the measured wind velocity of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 is a lower limit on the terminal velocity , since it is only relevant for the region in the wind where the h i absorption occurs .",
    "it is possible that additional radiative acceleration of the wind continues at radii further from the star than this region .      to derive the absolute photometry of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 ,",
    "we must first correct for interstellar extinction . in order to compare the photometry of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 with that of the pistol star and qf362 in a consistent way",
    ", we adopted the same intrinsic color , bolometric correction , and extinction law used by figer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the analysis of the pistol star , using @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 mag .",
    "we assumed that the extinction relation holds for the @xmath17 band as well , and used the 2mass photometry from table 1 to compute the extinction values for lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 , the pistol star , and qf362 .",
    "the derived @xmath17-band extinction values for lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 , the pistol star , and qf362 are @xmath18 , and 3.42 mag , respectively . assuming a distance of 8 kpc to the galactic center ( reid 1993 )",
    ", this implies absolute @xmath19 magnitudes of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 mag for lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 , the pistol star , and qf362 , respectively .",
    "thus , the bolometric luminosities of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 and the pistol star are @xmath23   and @xmath24  , respectively .",
    "the derived luminosity for qf362 is higher , with@xmath25  .",
    "however , najarro et al . ( 2009 ) derived stellar luminosities for the pistol star and qf362 that are significantly lower than the values presented here , deriving @xmath26   for both stars .",
    "their analysis is based on the detailed modeling of the near - infrared spectra of these stars , which probably resulted in more accurate results than our photometry based calculations .",
    "admittedly , our assumption of a universal bolometric correction and intrinsic color for lbvs is crude , and may have led to a significant error in our derived bolometric luminosities . currently , the only inference we can make with confidence is that the relative @xmath27 values reflect relative @xmath17 luminosities .",
    "photometric monitoring of flux and color changes , in tandem with spectroscopic monitoring and modeling of the spectra , is necessary to elucidate the relationship between intrinsic infrared brightness , color , and bolometric luminosity .",
    "lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 is a variable star , identified as such by glass et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) , who monitored the central @xmath28 of the galaxy in a @xmath3-band photometric campaign between 1994 and 1997 , with about four individual observations per year .",
    "lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 , the pistol star , and qf362 were all detected as large - amplitude variables in this survey , cataloged with the respective designations 10 - 1 , 13 - 4 , and 13 - 6 .",
    "the light curves of these three stars are presented in figure 3 ; the data for the pistol star and qf362 were first presented in glass et al .",
    "lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 appears to have undergone an overall decrease in brightness by @xmath01 mag between 1994 and 1997 , but also showed signs of significant intra - month variability ( @xmath00.35 mag ) during 1994 . during the same 4 year time span , the pistol star s variations were also significant ( @xmath29 mag or so ) but less extreme than lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 , while the magnitude of qf362 s variations are similar to those of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 .",
    "the time - averaged brightness and the variability amplitude of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 exceed that of the pistol star and qf362 , which have @xmath3-band magnitudes and standard deviations of 6.86 ( 0.41 ) , 7.38 ( 0.15 ) , and 7.43 ( 0.26 ) mag , respectively .",
    "the fact that lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 has a larger average brightness than the pistol star , while suffering more extinction ( see section 3.2 ) , implies that it was more intrinsically more luminous in the infrared than the pistol star throughout the duration of the glass et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) survey .",
    "however , during the later 2mass observation , which occurred on jd2451825.4954 ( 2000 october 17 ) , the infrared luminosity of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 and the pistol star were more - or - less equivalent , while that of lbv qf362 exceeded both of them , as indicated by the analysis in section 3.2 . without color or spectroscopic information to accompany the flux changes in figure 3 it is not possible to determine whether the variations reflect a change in the total bolometric luminosity of these stars , as appears to be the case for the lbv ag car , or changes in spectral morphology at constant bolometric luminosity ( e.g. , see groh et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "alternatively , infrared photometric variability may occur as a result of the variable free - free component induced by a changing mass - loss rate .",
    "again , we are in need of simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic monitoring to discriminate between potential causes for the brightness variations observed from these stars .",
    "the shell of p@xmath2 emission surrounding lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 is remarkably circular ( presumably spherical ) , relative to the elongated morphology of the pistol nebula .",
    "we found no obvious counterpart to the shell of lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 in the _",
    "spitzer_/infrared array camera mid - infrared images of the region , which contrasts with the pistol nebula , which is bright at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the shell surrounding lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 is illuminated interstellar material , unrelated to the central lbv .",
    "rather , the nebula appears to have been ejected from lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 .",
    "this would not be surprising , since the pistol nebula , and the nebulae surrounding other lbvs , such as @xmath6 carina , exhibit unambiguous kinematical evidence for ejection ( e.g. , see figer et al .",
    "1999b ; currie et al .",
    "the @xmath0200 angular radius of the shell surrounding lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 implies a physical radius of @xmath00.8 pc .",
    "the average expansion velocity of the 10 lbv ejection nebulae , summarized in table 6 of figer et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , is @xmath0100 km s@xmath13 , with a standard deviation of @xmath0170 km s@xmath13 ; and most of these nebulae have estimated dynamical times of @xmath30 yr .",
    "so , assuming this is close approximation of the expansion velocity for the shell surrounding lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 implies that the presumed ejection event probably occurred @xmath0500010,000 yr before present .",
    "the new p@xmath2 image in figure 1 also reveals a noteworthy feature associated with the pistol nebula .",
    "the flattening of the nebula s left side was suggested by figer et al .",
    "( 1999b ) to be the result of either ( 1 ) the interaction of the pistol nebula with the stellar winds of quintuplet cluster members , or ( 2 ) the interaction of the pistol nebula with the strong milligauss magnetic field that comprises the arched radio filaments , which are concentrated near the quintuplet cluster .",
    "it has been suggested that the strong magnetic field that creates the filaments is pervasive throughout the galactic center region ( yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ) .",
    "the magnetic pressure from such a strong field will suppress the flow of ionized material , such as an expanding lbv ejection nebula , in the direction perpendicular to the field , which may responsible for the flattening of the left side of the pistol nebula in figure 1 .",
    "however , the faint rim of the pistol nebula s _ right _ side is not flattened , which suggests that if the galactic center magnetic field is responsible for the flattening of the left side of the pistol nebula , then the strong magnetic field may be a _ local _ phenomenon , rather than a pervasive feature of the galactic center region as a whole .    finally , we note that there may be evidence for a past outburst from lbv qf362 as well .",
    "low - level p@xmath2 emission , in the form of irregular knots and tendrils , appears to surround the position of qf362 , apparent in figure 1 .",
    "this could be material thrown off by the star during a prior outburst .",
    "alternatively , since qf362 appears to lie relatively close to the edge of the sickle , the low - level emission surrounding it could be the ionized interstellar material , formerly of the sickle structure , still in the process of being evaporated away . deeper imaging of the low - level emission at higher resolution with the _",
    "hst_/nicmos nic1 camera could resolve this issue by providing unambiguous evidence for a physical association between lbv qf362 and the low - level nebular emission surrounding it .",
    "lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 lies @xmath028 from the quintuplet cluster , which also contains qf362 and the pistol star . assuming a distance of 8 kpc to the galactic center ( reid 1993 ) , this angular separation implies a projected physical separation of @xmath07 pc from the quintuplet .",
    "the presence of three lbvs within such a small projected volume makes this region the largest known concentration of lbvs .",
    "such a concentration is remarkable , given the very short period of time massive stars spend in the lbv phase ( @xmath31 yr , langer et al .",
    "therefore , we suggest that lbv g0.120@xmath32 is coeval with the quintuplet cluster , and either formed outside the main cluster , but during the same burst of star formation , or formed within the cluster and was subsequently ejected from it somehow .    figer et al . (",
    "1998 ) suggested that the pistol star has an initial mass in the range of 150250 .",
    "owing to their similarities in intrinsic brightness and spectral properties , it would be reasonable to assume that lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 and the pistol star have comparable masses .",
    "if lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 did originate within the quintuplet , it is hard to explain how such a massive star could be so far removed from the cluster , rather than residing near its center as a consequence of dynamical mass segregation .",
    "however , it has been suggested that lbvs might result from the merger of a close binary ( pasquali et al .",
    "close binaries are expected to form in the dense environs of starburst clusters , while the same multi - body interactions that harden close binaries and induce mergers , also impart a systemic velocity to the hardened binary or merger byproduct that is on the order of 10 km s@xmath13 ( gaburov et al .",
    "2010 ) . since the internal velocity dispersion of the quintuplet is also @xmath710 km s@xmath13 ( figer et al .",
    "1999a ) , an additional velocity of 10 km s@xmath13 imparted to a star or binary could allow it to escape the cluster .",
    "the stellar merger origin has been proposed for the pistol star ( figer & kim 2002 ; gaburov et al .",
    "2008 ) , while the dynamical ejection of hardened binaries produced within the quintuplet was proposed to explain several colliding - wind binaries found near the quintuplet ( mauerhan et al . 2007 ;",
    "mauerhan et al .",
    "although the merger - byproduct hypothesis is currently a very speculative suggestion , it could be given credence if one or all of the quintuplet lbvs were shown to be moving away from the cluster .",
    "alternatively , lbv g0.120@xmath10.048 may have formed during the same burst of star formation that created the quintuplet , originating from the same molecular cloud , but never becoming a bound member of the cluster .",
    "a proper motion measurement , enabled by adaptive optics , could provide evidence for or against a quintuplet cluster origin within a few years .",
