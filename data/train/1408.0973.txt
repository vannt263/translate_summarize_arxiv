    "the mass of  is found to be 3871.69@xmath140.17 mev , which is very close to or even corresponds to the  threshold , 3871.80@xmath140.12 mev , within the experimental errors @xcite .",
    "whether it is a resonance or a bound state has not been determined by the experiments yet .",
    "the  full width is less than 1.2 mev @xcite , which is very narrow for such a highly excited resonance .",
    "the cdf group performed the helicity amplitude analysis of the  @xmath15 decay and concluded that the state is @xmath16=@xmath17 or @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "recently , lhcb experiments determined that its quantum numbers are @xmath19 , ruling out the possibility of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the  is observed first in the @xmath20 spectrum from the @xmath0 decay .",
    "later , the peak in the final  states is also found .",
    "the experiments for the ratio of the partial decay width of  in the  channel to that in the @xmath11 channel , @xmath21 , however , are still controversial : the belle results give 8.92 @xmath14 2.42 for this value @xcite while the  results give 19.9 @xmath14 8.05 @xcite .",
    "these values are taken from the charged @xmath0 decay experiments because the  peak in the @xmath22 decay is still vague .",
    "let us mention an exceptional feature of the , which we will discuss in this paper extensively .",
    "it is found that the  decays both to the @xmath2 and to the @xmath3 states . according to the experiments @xcite ,",
    "the decay fraction of  into @xmath23 is comparable to that into @xmath24 : @xmath25 this isospin mixing is very large comparing to the usual one .",
    "for example , the size of the breaking in the @xmath26-@xmath27 mass difference is 0.003 .",
    "many theoretical works are being reported since the first observation of .",
    "the 1@xmath28 channel is investigated by the lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "it is reported that the @xmath29 , , and the  scattering states are found @xcite .",
    "it seems , however , that the present lattice calculation still has difficulty in dealing with a very shallow bound state or a resonance near the complicated thresholds with @xmath30 .",
    "one has to wait for future works to obtain the realistic  configuration on the lattice qcd .",
    "there are many phenomenological models to describe the .",
    "most of the them can be classified into four types : the ones that take the  charmonium picture , the tetraquark picture , the two - meson hadronic molecule picture , and the charmonium - two - meson hybrid picture , which are summarized in the review articles @xcite .",
    "the existence of ( 2p ) at 3950 mev was predicted by the quark model which reproduces the meson masses below the open charm threshold very accurately @xcite .",
    "this @xmath31 seems to be a robust state , because the quark model with the screened confinement force also predicts its existence with a slightly lighter mass , 3901 mev @xcite .",
    "the charmonium options for the  has been carefully studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to explain the production rate of   in the high energy proton-(anti)proton collision experiments by the tevatron or the lhc ,",
    "a configuration small in size is favored . also , the observed rate of the  radiative decay to @xmath32 is comparable to that to @xmath33 @xcite , which strongly suggests that the  has the ( 2p ) component because such result is difficult to explain by the hadronic molecule picture @xcite . on the other hand , however , it is difficult to explain the  properties by assuming a simple @xmath17  state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 mass predicted by the quark models is much heavier than the observed  mass .",
    "the spectrum of the final pions suggests that there is the @xmath2 component in .",
    "the diquark - antidiquark or the tetraquark structure of  has been studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "the tetraquark state may be described by coupled two - meson states which are closely bound with the attraction arising from the quark degrees of freedom . moreover , as seen in table [ tbl : threshold - mass ] , there are four two - meson thresholds which are very close to the  mass .",
    "it is natural to assume that  has a large amount of these two - meson components .",
    "the possibility of  being the hadronic molecular structure has been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "thus , as a model which has both of the above strong points , the charmonium - hadronic molecule hybrid structure has been proposed for @xcite .",

    "this shape of the energy dependence can be derived by assuming the @xmath39 @xmath46-wave decay has also the monopole form factor , and the energy dependence of the imaginary part of the @xmath4 meson propagator is governed by that of the @xmath4 meson form factor .",
