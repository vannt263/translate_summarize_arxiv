    "there are many reasons as to why high @xmath0 superconductivity has attracted so much attention . aside from the obvious ( but very important ) prospects for technological applications of high @xmath0 materials ,",
    "a very salient reason is the mysterious nature of the pairing mechanism .",
    "since the bare electron - electron interaction is strongly repulsive , it seems that there are two ingredients essential to electron pairing : ( i ) how to overcome the coulomb repulsion and ( ii ) how to generate an attraction between quasiparticles .    in `` low '' @xmath0 superconductivity described well by the standard bcs theory ,",
    "the pairing mechanism is roughly as follows : electrons form a fermi liquid in which the strong coulomb interaction is renormalized into a screened interaction between dressed quasiparticles which interact very weakly ; with the strong repulsion gone , quasiparticles can form pairs through the exchange of phonons , which gives rise to a time - delayed attraction between quasiparticles . this intuition , while valid for standard bcs superconductors , is not correct for high @xmath0 materials .",
    "first , in contrast to low @xmath0 superconductors which are metallic in the normal state , cuprates are insulators at low doping , and thus it is not _ a priori _ clear whether high @xmath0 superconductivity in cuprates has anything to do with the landau - fermi liquid description of the normal state in metallic systems . in fact , this suspicion is reinforced by many non - fermi liquid behaviors of cuprates including pseudogap phenomena @xcite and stripe excitations @xcite . in other words , it is not clear how the strong coulomb repulsion can be overcome by standard quasiparticle screening mechanisms .",
    "second , there is a wealth of evidence suggesting that pairing might be induced by a source other than the phonon exchange .",
    "while certainly the high energy scale of @xmath0 in the cuprates itself is difficult to explain in terms of the phonon exchange mechanism , probably one of the most persuasive pieces of evidence for a non - phonon pairing mechanism is the destruction of superconductivity ( or the strong suppression of @xmath0 ) when even a small concentration of cu atoms ( in the copper oxide plane ) are replaced by non - magnetic impurities such as zn @xcite .",
    "this is very suggestive of pairing with magnetic origin . also , very important in this context is the @xmath3-wave symmetry of the gap function @xcite , which is explained most naturally in terms of pairing due to magnetic interactions",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to assume that magnetic interactions have something to do with high @xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "however , the precise relationship between magnetism and high @xmath0 superconductivity is not very well understood ; it is not clear exactly how the magnetic interaction generates an attraction between electrons , especially at low doping .",
    "also , from a fundamental point of view , this attraction is very puzzling since , after the phonon - exchange mechanism ( i.e. , interaction between electrons and ions ) is ruled out , it is hard to appreciate how the remaining microscopic interaction could be substantially different from the completely repulsive bare electron - electron interaction .    despite the seemingly unrelated nature of the above two ingredients , they are , in fact ,",
    "very closely connected .",
    "specifically , it can be shown that the magnetic ( antiferromagnetic , to be precise ) interaction is a natural consequence of the strong repulsive interaction between electrons at low doping , a process known as _ super - exchange_. the precise mathematical derivation of super - exchange can be carried out in the framework of model hamiltonians . to this end , consider the hubbard model with repulsive on - site interaction @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spin index , and @xmath7 indicates that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are nearest neighbors .",
    "all models studied throughout this paper are defined on the square lattice .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , exactly at half filling , the hubbard model becomes identical to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model in the limit of large @xmath4 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , the spin and the electron - number operators at the site @xmath8 . physically speaking , the derivation of the heisenberg model is as follows : the zeroth order effect of @xmath1 for large @xmath4 is to completely prevent the double occupancy of any site , thereby minimizing the large on - site interaction energy cost , which , in turn , gives rise to a low - energy hilbert space in which sites are only singly occupied .",
    "this low - energy hilbert space , however , is hugely degenerate since all states with single occupancy have exactly the same energy .",
    "therefore , one has to investigate the next order effect of @xmath1 .",
    "exactly at half filling , there is no effect first order in @xmath1 because , when it acts on the degenerate hilbert space mentioned above , the hopping term in eq.([h_hub ] ) always creates a doubly occupied site which is outside the low - energy hilbert space .",
    "the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model emerges through the second - order contribution which is the virtual hopping process ( hence , @xmath14 ) .",
    "note that the virtual hopping process minimizes the kinetic energy cost in the presence of the strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "away from half filling with addition of holes , the heisenberg model generalizes to the @xmath1-@xmath2 model : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is given in eq.([h_j ] ) and @xmath17 the gutzwiller projection operator , @xmath18 , imposes the no - double - occupancy constraint , which handles the strong on - site interaction .",
    "it is important to note that , to order @xmath19 , the rigorous derivation of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model from the hubbard model requires the omission of three - site hopping terms @xcite , which can be justified at low doping because the hopping terms have zero matrix elements exactly at half filling and their contribution is roughly proportional to the hole concentration away from half filling . in some sense",
    ", there are two small expansion parameters involved in deriving the @xmath1-@xmath2 model from the hubbard model : @xmath20 and the hole concentration , @xmath21 .",
    "the three - site hopping terms may become sizable when either parameter is not small .    as shown in the above",
    ", antiferromagnetism is a natural consequence of the strong coulomb repulsion at low doped regimes .",
    "this is , of course , consistent with experimental findings that there is a well - defined long - range antiferromagnetic order ( also known as nel order ) at low doping .",
    "the next question , then , is when and if antiferromagnetism can generate pairing ; specifically , whether the @xmath1-@xmath2 model contains superconductivity in realistic parameter regimes ( with non - zero doping ) .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to provide evidence for the existence for superconductivity in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model . to this end",
    ", we investigate the connection between the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian .",
    "note that the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian is nothing but the bcs hamiltonian in the presence of the strong on - site repulsion .",
    "the viewpoint advocated in this paper that antiferromagnetism and high @xmath0 superconductivity are intimately connected is shared by many of previous theories including the @xmath22 theory @xcite . the central hypothesis of the @xmath22 theory is that antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are just two different manifestations of a single object called superspin which combines the three - dimensional antiferromagnetic order parameter and the two - dimensional superconducting order parameter .",
    "apart from the phenomenological appeal of this idea , it is crucial from the microscopic point of view that one should be able to derive an effective superspin model from well - known microscopic models such as the @xmath23 model in a reliable manner .",
    "one of such attempts was to use some form of the renormalization - group transformation @xcite .",
    "in this paper , however , we take a different approach , as outlined below .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the precise mathematical form of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian is given in sec .",
    "[ bcs_hamiltonian ] where we discuss the physical motivation for studying its connection to antiferromagnetism .",
    "we also discuss the relationship between the ground state of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian and anderson s resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state @xcite ( i.e. , the gutzwiller - projected bcs ground state ) . in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] , by computing the wavefunction overlap via exact diagonalization in finite systems , we provide evidence suggesting that the ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model is closely connected to the ground state of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian . in particular , we emphasize that , within the limits of numerical accuracy , the ground state of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( i.e. , the @xmath1-@xmath2 model at half filling ) is equivalent to that of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian with strong pairing .",
    "in fact , this equivalence can be derived analytically . in sec .",
    "[ analytic ] , we provide an analytic derivation for the equivalence between the heisenberg model and the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian with strong pairing . we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] by discussing physical implications of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian .",
    "we begin by providing a physical motivation for studying the connection between the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and the projected bcs hamiltonian . for this purpose , it is convenient to write the pairing term of the bcs hamiltonian in real space : @xmath24 which creates a resonance of the singlet pair between the site @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath25 . on the other hand , the singlet pair is energetically preferred by the antiferromagnetic exchange term in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model : @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , despite their different appearances , the pairing term and the antiferromagnetic exchange term seem to have a similar physical effect ; they both prefer singlet pairs ( at least , between nearest neighbors ) .",
    "this similarity serves as a motivation to investigate whether there is a connection between the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and some form of the bcs hamiltonian . in this paper",
    ", we take the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is given in eq.([h_t ] ) .",
    "also , the pairing term is @xmath30 where we are primarily interested in a pairing with @xmath3-wave symmetry , where @xmath31 if @xmath32 and @xmath33 if @xmath34 .",
    "however , we also examine the pairing with extended @xmath35-wave symmetry , where @xmath31 for both @xmath32 and @xmath36 , and the hamiltonian is denoted as @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 in eq.([h_gbcs ] ) has a very similar structure as @xmath39 in eq.([h_tj ] ) .",
    "the only change is that @xmath40 in @xmath38 replaces @xmath16 in @xmath39 , which is motivated by the possible correspondence between the pairing term and the antiferromagnetic exchange term .",
    "note that @xmath41 is the usual bcs hamiltonian in the real space representation , and hence @xmath42 .    in order to provide evidence for the close connection between the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian",
    ", we will pursue two approaches with one being numerical ( sec .",
    "[ numerical ] ) and the other being analytical ( sec . [ analytic ] ) .",
    "but , before presenting our results , we would like to briefly discuss the relationship between the ground state of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian and the rvb state proposed by anderson @xcite , which is just the gutzwiller - projected bcs ground state : @xmath43 where @xmath18 is the previously introduced gutzwiller projection operator imposing the no - double - occupancy constraint .",
    "@xmath44 is the electron - number projection operator which is necessary for constructing states with definite electron number from the bcs ground state , @xmath45 , that has an intrinsic fluctuation in particle number .    in general",
    ", @xmath46 is not the exact ground state of @xmath38 since the gutzwiller projection does not commute with the bcs hamiltonian , @xmath47 : @xmath48 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the difference between @xmath46 and the ground state of @xmath38 is particularly severe at half filling because , as shown in the later sections , the ground state of @xmath38 has long - range antiferromagnetic order ( nel order ) at half filling , while @xmath46 does not .",
    "since the exact ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model has nel order at half filling , it seems that @xmath46 can not be a good ansatz wavefunction for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , at least for regimes very close to half filling .",
    "this was one of the reasons why @xmath46 was proposed as a candidate for the ground state of models with sufficiently strong `` quantum frustration '' ( to destroy nel order ) , examples of which include models with the next - nearest - neighbor exchange coupling , @xmath49 , and antiferromagnetic models on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath46 was conjectured to be a good ansatz wavefunction for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model at moderate , non - zero doping .",
    "its validity , however , has remained very controversial even after many years of active research @xcite .",
    "the situation is different for the ground state of @xmath38 .",
    "in addition to the possession of nel order at half filling , the ground state of @xmath38 also has a very high overlap with the ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model at moderate doping ( in fact , unity overlap at half filling ) , as shown in the next section .",
    "therefore , the ground state of @xmath38 can be taken as a good ansatz wavefunction for the ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model at general doping .",
    "now , this brings up an interesting question : how is the ground state of @xmath38 related to the rvb state at non - zero doping ? in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] , it is argued that , despite severe differences at half filling , the rvb state is , in fact , qualitatively similar to the ground state of @xmath38 in doped regimes sufficiently away from half filling .",
    "in this section , we present numerical evidence for the close connection between the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian . while some numerical results are available in a previous paper by the author @xcite , more details are given in this section along with new results .",
    "before we provide detailed evidence , we would like to emphasize two important aspects of the numerical approach used in this paper .",
    "the first aspect pertains to the computing technique while the second issue concerns what to compute .",
    "first , we use exact diagonalization as the computing technique .",
    "exact diagonalization offers an _ unbiased _ approach , as opposed to other methods with biased assumptions or guesses , which include the large @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) expansion @xcite and variational monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "uncontrolled approximations in techniques mentioned above require an independent verification of the involved assumptions .",
    "in contrast , exact diagonalization can determine the exact ground state wavefunction without bias @xcite .",
    "the problem is , however , that its application is limited to studies of finite systems with relatively small spatial size .",
    "this limitation motivates the second aspect of the numerical approach in this paper .",
    "the second aspect of our numerical approach concerns what to compute . in general , evidence for long - range order",
    "is provided by relevant correlation functions . in the case of superconductivity ,",
    "the relevant correlation function is the pairing correlation function : @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "true off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) can be claimed only when @xmath54 remains non - zero in the limit of large distance @xmath55 .",
    "unfortunately , however , the small spatial size of finite systems accessible via exact diagonalization makes the distinction between true long - range order and short - range order ( present even in normal states ) ambiguous .",
    "therefore , a measure of pairing order that is _ unambiguous _ even in finite system studies is needed .",
    "an inspiration comes from the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , where our understanding of the subject is significantly advanced by the direct comparison between ansatz wavefunctions and exact states .",
    "it is well accepted by now that all essential aspects of the fqhe are explained by the composite fermion ( cf ) theory @xcite which is a general theory of the fqhe including the laughlin state @xcite as a subset .",
    "while there are various ( both experimental and theoretical ) verifications of the composite fermion theory , arguably the most significant is the amazing agreement between the exact ground state and the cf wavefunction : the overlap is practically unity for various short - range interactions including the coulomb interaction @xcite . indeed , as was crucial in establishing the cf theory for the fqhe , we would in turn like to achieve the same methodological clarity for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .    in order to give a perspective on the significance of wavefunction overlap in finite system studies ,",
    "consider two randomly - chosen states in a hilbert space with @xmath56 basis states .",
    "then , the possibility for having a large wavefunction overlap between those two states is roughly @xmath57 .",
    "so , roughly speaking , if the square of the overlap between an ansatz state and the exact state is significantly higher than @xmath57 , it can be argued that the ansatz state is a good representation of the exact state .",
    "the main finite system studied in this paper is the @xmath58 square lattice system , whose hilbert space has @xmath59 - @xmath60 basis states depending on the number of holes ( even after translational symmetries are implemented as reported in this paper ) .",
    "therefore , in our system , the possibility for having a large wavefunction overlap between two random states by chance is roughly @xmath61 - @xmath62 .",
    "we will show in the following sections that the square of the overlap between the ground states of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian is very close to unity at optimal parameter ranges ( typically @xmath63 - @xmath64 depending on parameters ) .",
    "while it may seem straightforward at first to compute wavefunction overlap by exactly diagonalizing the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian , there is a subtle , but physically important twist in applying exact diagonalization to the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "the subtlety arises from the fact that there is a ( coherent ) fluctuation in particle number due to the pairing term in @xmath65 which has matrix elements mixing the hilbert space of @xmath66 and @xmath67 electrons . in order to incorporate the particle - number fluctuation into finite system studies , we diagonalize @xmath68 in the combined hilbert space of @xmath66 and @xmath69 electrons , which , in turn , invariably requires a careful treatment of the chemical potential . in essence",
    ", the chemical potential is adjusted so that the kinetic energy plus the chemical potential energy of the @xmath70 particle ground state is the same as that of the @xmath71 particle ground state .",
    "once the chemical potential is set this way , the mixing with other particle - number sectors such as the @xmath72 and @xmath73 sectors can be shown to be negligibly small , even if it is allowed .",
    "for more details , readers are referred to discussions in the following sections .",
    "finally , the following notations are defined for future convenience : @xmath74 denotes the ground state of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian obtained from the combined hilbert space of @xmath75 and @xmath76 holes in the system of @xmath50 sites .",
    "( note that the sum of the number of electrons and holes equals the number of sites : @xmath77 ) .",
    "@xmath78 denotes the number projection operator which projects states onto the hilbert space of states with @xmath79 holes , and renormalizes the projected states .",
    "@xmath80 is the exact ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model in the hilbert space of @xmath75 holes in @xmath50 sites .",
    "numerical evidence for the close connection between the ground states of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian is presented as follows : in sec .",
    "[ symmetry ] , the symmetry of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian with @xmath3-wave pairing is discussed .",
    "then , the wavefunction overlap between @xmath80 and the appropriately number - projected @xmath74 is computed in sec . [ undoped ] for the case of undoped regime , which is followed by similar calculations in sec . [ optimallydoped ] for the optimally doped regime , and in sec . [ overdoped ] for the overdoped regime .      in general , before solving any hamiltonian , one has to examine the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "incorporating symmetry is particularly important when two different hamiltonians are compared since it is possible for their ground states to have completely different symmetries from each other .",
    "the bcs hamiltonian with @xmath3-wave pairing is particularly tricky in this respect because ( i ) it does not conserve the particle number and ( ii ) it is not invariant under diagonal reflection , i.e. , @xmath81 ( or , equivalently , under rotation in space by @xmath82 ) .",
    "therefore , it does not conserve parity with respect to diagonal reflection .",
    "surprisingly , however , the effects of the above two properties cancel and can be eliminated simultaneously by applying the number projection operator to the ground state of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian , as explained below .",
    "( as far as parity is concerned , it is not important whether the bcs hamiltonian is gutzwiller - projected ; the gutzwiller projection commutes with diagonal reflection . )",
    "first , the non - conservation of particle number is , of course , a direct consequence of the pairing term in the bcs hamiltonian , @xmath83 . at first glance",
    ", the uncertainty in particle number may seem as a theoretical artifact in the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "but , the coherent fluctuation in particle number is essential for superconductivity since it is vital to the superfluid phase coherence .",
    "( the coherent fluctuation in superconductors stands in sharp contrast with the incoherent fluctuation in thermodynamic ensembles . ) on the other hand , when a precise comparison with number eigenstates ( such as the ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model ) is required , the ground state of the bcs hamiltonian should be projected onto the hilbert space of states with a definite particle number .",
    "the number projection operator , @xmath84 , performs this task .",
    "second , the non - conservation of parity with respect to diagonal reflection is due to the sign difference in @xmath3-wave pairing amplitudes between the @xmath21 and @xmath85 direction . to be more precise",
    ", the non - conservation of parity is mathematically expressed as follows : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the diagonal reflection operator and @xmath88 is the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian given in eq.([h_gbcs ] ) with the dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath89 shown explicitly .",
    "note the sign change of @xmath89 in @xmath38 in the right - hand side of eq.([parity1 ] ) .",
    "now , for convenience , eq.([parity1 ] ) is re - written as follows : @xmath90 since @xmath91 .",
    "what we want to prove in this section is that a number - projected eigenstate of @xmath38 is also a parity eigenstate .",
    "we begin by defining @xmath92 as an eigenstate of @xmath88 : @xmath93 also , for convenience , let us write @xmath92 in vector form showing amplitudes in each individual particle - number sector .",
    "that is , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the amplitude for the @xmath96-th basis element in the @xmath70 particle hilbert space .",
    "similarly , @xmath97 is the amplitude for the @xmath98-th basis element in the @xmath72 particle hilbert space .",
    "now , it is not too difficult to show that @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the same energy as in eq.([eigen1 ] ) and @xmath101^\\frac{n_e}{2 } c^{\\alpha}_{n_e},\\cdots,[-1]^{\\frac{n_e+2}{2 } } c^{\\beta}_{n_e+2},\\cdots \\right ) , \\label{eigen2_state}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is restricted to even numbers since we are interested only in paired states . what accounts for the form of eq.([eigen2_state ] ) is that the pairing term , @xmath65 , always mixes the hilbert spaces with particle numbers differing by two . attaching the relative sign according to the particle number ( i.e. , @xmath102^\\frac{n_e}{2}$ ] and @xmath102^\\frac{n_e+2}{2}$ ] for the @xmath70 and @xmath72 hilbert space , respectively ) is tantamount to changing the sign of @xmath89 in @xmath65 .",
    "note that a relative sign difference between distinct hilbert spaces does not alter the hopping term since @xmath29 does not mix hilbert spaces with different particle numbers .",
    "now , let @xmath103 act on both sides of eq.([eigen1 ] ) : @xmath104 which , with aids of eq.([parity2 ] ) , becomes @xmath105 then , by comparing eq.([eigen2 ] ) and ( [ eigen3 ] ) , one is able to conclude that @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a constant which is almost ( though not quite yet ) an eigenvalue . after acting on both sides by @xmath108 ,",
    "the above equation becomes @xmath109 ( note that @xmath84 commutes with @xmath103 .",
    "also , there is no loss of generality in choosing @xmath110 . )",
    "moreover , since @xmath111 eq.([parity_conclusion1 ] ) becomes @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "consequently , @xmath114 is an eigenstate of the parity with respect to the diagonal reflection .    until now",
    ", only the spatial symmetry has been investigated .",
    "( note that @xmath38 is invariant under the spatial translation , and therefore linear momentum is conserved . )",
    "now , we would like to briefly consider spin rotation symmetry .",
    "the hopping term is obviously invariant under spin rotation .",
    "in addition , the pairing term can be also shown to be invariant under the spin rotation : @xmath115=0 $ ] where the total spin is @xmath116 .",
    "the essential physics of the spin - rotational invariance of the pairing term is the fact that @xmath65 concerns only spin - singlet pairs , which are rotationally invariant .      in this section ,",
    "we provide numerical evidence indicating that , at half filling , the ground state of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian is actually equivalent to the ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model in the limit of strong pairing , i.e. , @xmath117 . to this end",
    ", the wavefunction overlap between the two ground states is computed as a function of @xmath118 via a modified lanczos method for exact diagonalization .",

    "the reason for the former is that , at half filling , the @xmath1-@xmath2 model becomes the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model where @xmath2 is just an overall scale factor .    as mentioned previously ,",

    "the overlap between the ground states of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian is given by @xmath123 as a function of @xmath118 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the overlap is very high even for @xmath124 , and saturates very quickly to unity as @xmath118 increases further . for sufficiently large values of @xmath118 ,",
    "the overlap is indistinguishable from unity to within numerical accuracy ( we have actually studied @xmath118 values ranging as high as 1000 ) . therefore , as far as our finite system is concerned , the ground state of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian is exactly identical to the ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model in the limit of strong pairing , i.e. , @xmath117 . in view of the fact that there are roughly @xmath59 basis states in the hilbert space for the @xmath58 system at half filling even after translational symmetries are implemented , the high overlap is particularly salient .",
    "we have also checked that the above result also holds in the 4-site ( @xmath125 ) and the 10-site ( @xmath126 ) systems .",
    "it should be emphasized that the equivalence between the ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and that of the projected bcs hamiltonian with strong pairing does not necessarily mean strong superconductivity since , despite strong pairing , there is little charge fluctuation near half filling , and therefore little phase coherence .",
    "the equivalence between the ground states of the projected bcs hamiltonian and the @xmath1-@xmath2 model at half filling has a very important physical implication for the origin of high @xmath0 superconductivity supporting a long - standing conjecture @xcite .",
    "the conjecture is that electrons are already paired at half filling , and therefore form a condensate .",
    "however , electrons can not superconduct ( or , for that matter , even conduct ) at half filling because there is no room for them to travel .",

    "an essential point is that the large-@xmath4 behavior of @xmath156 and @xmath157 can be dealt with systematically in our approach where we analyze finite-@xmath4 models and take the large-@xmath4 limit as the gutzwiller projection .",

    "( [ eq_sp ] ) by translating @xmath268 by ( @xmath269 ) .",
    "a constant translation in momentum does not affect the integral in the saddle - point equation . to be specific , if the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq_sp2 ] ) , @xmath270 , is a function of @xmath158 : @xmath271 then the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq_sp ] ) , @xmath272 , is related to @xmath155 by the same function @xmath273 : @xmath274 the precise functional form of @xmath275 is not important for general @xmath21 , but it is useful to know that @xmath276 when @xmath277 .",
    "now , considering the definition of @xmath234 and @xmath235 , it is not too difficult to show that effects of both fluctuation hamiltonians become equivalent in the large-@xmath4 limit since ( i ) @xmath278 for general @xmath4 , if @xmath1 is set equal to @xmath150 , and ( ii ) low - energy hilbert spaces for both models reduce to the same hilbert space , @xmath181 , in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "so , in essence , it has been shown that , in the large-@xmath4 limit , all matrix elements for both fluctuation hamiltonians are the same in the low - energy hilbert space .",
    "it is very important to note that we are interested in the the lowest - order , non - zero effect of finite @xmath150 and @xmath1 in the limit of large @xmath4 . since , in the large-@xmath4 limit , eigenstates themselves should be parameter free , lowest - order effects of finite finite @xmath150 and @xmath1 must emerge through their effects on @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively .",
    "we now establish that matrix elements of both saddle - point hamiltonians , @xmath174 and @xmath233 , are also identical .",
    "we begin by considering two arbitrary states from the low - energy hilbert space of the bcs hamiltonian with finite @xmath4 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath174 between these two states is , then , @xmath281 where @xmath282 and @xmath283 in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "note that the invariance of @xmath149 and @xmath284 under spin rotations is used .",
    "similarly , in the large-@xmath4 limit , the matrix element of @xmath233 between the above states is as follows : @xmath285 where @xmath286 in the large-@xmath4 limit . therefore , it is clear from a comparison of eq .",
    "( [ me1 ] ) and ( [ me2 ] ) that the matrix elements are identical , provided that the large-@xmath4 limit is taken while @xmath1 is set equal to @xmath150 .",
    "note that @xmath287 for general @xmath4 if @xmath288 .",
    "we have learned two lessons from step ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "first , the ground states of the saddle - point hamiltonians , @xmath233 and @xmath174 , are identical in the large-@xmath4 limit , and therefore low - energy hilbert spaces ( which are obtained by applying rigid spin rotations to the saddle - point ground states ) are also identical in this limit .",
    "second , in the low - energy hilbert space , matrix elements for the fluctuation hamiltonians are identical for both the hubbard model and the strong - pairing bcs hamiltonian with the same being true for the two saddle - point hamiltonians .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the strong - pairing gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian at half filling is equivalent to the 2d antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .      in this section",
    ", we would like to discuss an interesting corollary of the analytic derivation given in previous sections .",
    "our derivation is actually valid also for the strong - pairing bcs hamiltonian with an extended @xmath35-wave pairing : @xmath289 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the saddle - point equation for extended @xmath35-wave pairing is the same as that of @xmath3-wave pairing and , consequently , all matrix elements remain the same as obtained for @xmath3-wave case .",
    "note that extended @xmath35-wave pairing is induced by nearest - neighbor pairing amplitudes with the same sign for the @xmath21 and @xmath85 directions in contrast to the opposite signs in @xmath3-wave pairing . however , despite this important distinction , it is proven as a corollary to our @xmath3-wave result that , at half filling , the strong - pairing gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian with extended @xmath35-wave pairing is also equivalent to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .    to test this assertion numerically , we compute the wavefunction overlap between the ground states of the heisenberg model and the strong - pairing gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian with extended @xmath35-wave pairing .",
    "as before , we analyze the 4@xmath1284 square lattice system via exact diagonalization .",
    "to be specific , the strong - pairing gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian with extended @xmath35-wave pairing is given by : @xmath290 where @xmath291 shows that , for sufficiently large @xmath118 , the overlap indeed becomes essentially unity for both @xmath292 [ extended @xmath35-wave pairing ] and @xmath293 [ @xmath3-wave pairing ] .",
    "model and those of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian with @xmath294 [ extended @xmath35-wave pairing ] and @xmath293 [ @xmath3-wave pairing ] . [ fig8],width=211 ]    as before in the @xmath3-wave case , it is also interesting to examine the doped regimes .",
    "while there is no difference between extended @xmath35-wave and @xmath3-wave pairing at half filling , the @xmath1-@xmath2 model prefers @xmath3-wave pairing at finite doping ( at least in the @xmath295 channel ) . shows the wavefunction overlap for the @xmath58 system with 2 holes .",
    "except for the trivial parameter regime of very small @xmath119 ( top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , the overlap essentially vanishes for extended @xmath35-wave pairing in contrast to the high overlap for the case of @xmath3-wave pairing ( bottom panel in fig . [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we conclude by discussing the physical implications of the close connection between the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian and the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "there are practical implications as well as fundamental ones .",
    "fundamentally , the close connection between the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian and the @xmath1-@xmath2 model provides evidence for the existence of superconductivity in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , which , in turn , may suggest that it is not only possible , but rather natural that the pairing in high @xmath0 superconductors is caused purely by electronic correlations .    now that we have reason to believe that the antiferromagnetic interaction is closely related to electron - electron pairing , the next natural question is how this connection can be used for the quantitative understanding of experiments .",
    "while it is in principle straightforward to apply exact diagonalization to the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian , exactly solving the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian is as complicated as solving the @xmath1-@xmath2 model in the first place .",
    "the true practical advantage of analyzing the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian , however , lies in the fact that the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian is much more amenable to the ansatz wavefunction approach than the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "ansatz wavefunction approaches have been very successful in various strongly correlated problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "two very salient examples are the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) and the liquid helium . despite their apparent difference in the physical context",
    ", there is actually a rather profound commonality between the above , two examples . in both cases ,",
    "dominant short - range correlations are first separated from long - range correlations .",
    "then , effects of the strong short - range correlations are captured by the attachment of the jastrow factor .",
    "the specific functional form of the jastrow factor , of course , depends on the nature of the problem at hand .",
    "after short - range correlations are taken into account via the jastrow factor , it is assumed that residual long - range correlations are relatively much weaker so that the rest of the ansatz wavefunction describes essentially non - interacting quasiparticles .",
    "specifically , the ansatz wavefunction for the fqhe is given by the composite fermion ( cf ) wavefunction @xcite .",
    "in essence , the cf wavefunction is a product of the jastrow factor , @xmath296 with @xmath297 an integer and @xmath298 , and a non - interacting fermionic wavefunction of new quasiparticles known as composite fermions .",
    "it is known that the above functional form of the jastrow factor is most effective in minimizing the coulomb repulsion between electrons in the lowest landau level ; the wavefunction overlap between the cf wavefunction and the exact ground state is practically unity for all available finite - system studies @xcite .",
    "another example is liquid helium .",
    "the microscopic wavefunction for normal state @xmath299he is written in terms of an algebraic product of the jastrow factor and the slater determinant of plane - wave states",
    "@xcite : @xmath300 } \\textrm{det}\\left|e^{i{\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf r}}\\right|\\ ] ] where @xmath301 is determined by the interaction between he atoms : typically , @xmath302 .",
    "while the slater determinant provides the necessary antisymmetrization as well as the low - energy physics , the jastrow factor captures dominant short - range correlations .",
    "similarly , the ansatz wavefunction for superfluid @xmath303he is given by : @xmath304}\\ ] ] where @xmath305 is basically identical @xmath301 except for slight changes due to the mass difference between @xmath299he and @xmath303he .",
    "since the ground state wavefunction for non - interacting bosons is just a constant , the ansatz wavefunction for superfluid @xmath303he can be also viewed as the product of the jastrow factor and a wavefunction for non - interacting bosons .    from the discussion",
    "so far , it seems promising that a range of strongly correlated problems can be attacked via the jastrow - factor approach , provided that residual , long - range correlations are weak so that , to a good approximation , they can be treated as those of non - interacting quasi - particles .",
    "one criterion for the weakness of residual interaction may be whether or not the residual interaction can cause an instability toward a new phase . in other words , as long as the ground state for the original interaction ( causing the strong short - range correlation ) is not completely different from that of weakly - interacting ( emergent ) quasi - particles , the jastrow - factor approach can provide a good ansatz wavefunction .",
    "the situation for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , or the hubbard model in the large-@xmath4 limit , is quite intriguing .",
    "first , note that the gutzwiller projection can be actually regarded as the jastrow factor imposing the no - double - occupancy constraint that occurs because of the strong on - site repulsion in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "keeping in mind that the @xmath1-@xmath2 model is the hubbard model in the large-@xmath4 limit , it may be conjectured that the ground state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model is described well by the gutzwiller - projected fermi - sea state .",
    "unfortunately , however , this is not true at half filling .",
    "we have learned in sec .",
    "[ step_ii ] that , at half filling , even the infinitesimally weak interaction , @xmath4 , can cause a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) instability leading to long - range antiferromagnetic order , i.e. , nel order .",
    "therefore , at least close to half filling where nel order persists , the gutzwiller - projected fermi - sea state can not be a good ansatz wavefunction .",
    "on the other hand , away from half filling , the sdw instability disappears because perfect nesting is ruined with non - zero doping , as shown in sec .",
    "[ step_i ] .",
    "one may assume now that the gutzwiller - projected fermi - sea state can be a good ansatz wavefunction for finite , non - zero doping .",
    "this is , however , not true either because there is another instability caused by electron - electron pairing .",
    "it is , in some sense , the goal of this paper to show that the @xmath1-@xmath2 model contains a pairing instability . motivated by the fact that the gutzwiller projection can play a role of the jastrow factor for the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian , we now show that the gutzwiller - projected bcs wavefunction ( i.e. , the rvb state ) is , in fact , a good ansatz wavefunction for the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian at finite , non - zero doping , which , in turn , leads to the eventual connection between the ground state of the @xmath23 model and the projected bcs wavefunction .     system . plotted is the square of the overlap between the ground state of the @xmath23 model and those of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian with @xmath293 [ @xmath3-wave pairing ] .",
    "the discontinuity in the square of the overlap is due to the sudden symmetry change in the ground state .",
    "[ fig9],width=211 ]    while there have been studies showing that , for finite doping , the gutzwiller - projected bcs wavefunction yields good agreement with experiments @xcite as well as with some numerical studies @xcite , we provide a more direct piece of evidence .",
    "hasegawa and poilblanc @xcite have shown that the overlap between the projected bcs wavefunction and the ground state of the @xmath23 model is high ( @xmath306 ) for the case of 2 holes in the @xmath126 lattice system . in order to make a direct comparison ,",
    "we have computed the overlap between the ground state of the projected bcs hamiltonian and that of the @xmath23 model in the same system ; we find that the optimal overlap for the ground state of the projected bcs hamiltonian is more than @xmath307 for the same @xmath126 lattice system , as shown in fig .",
    "therefore , it is shown ( at least , in finite system studies ) that the projected bcs wavefunction is a good ansatz wavefunction for the projected bcs hamiltonian , as expected from the jastrow - factor approach .    regarding the work of hasegawa and poilblanc @xcite , it is interesting to note that they also computed the overlap between the projected bcs wavefunction and the ground state of the @xmath23 model in the @xmath58 lattice system and they found that it was very low ( @xmath308 ) .",
    "this sudden drop in the overlap is a finite - system - size artifact due to the fact that the half - filled fermi sea state ( technically speaking , its chemical potential ) is ill - defined in the @xmath309 system with @xmath310 an even integer ( e.g. , the @xmath58 system ) , while there is no such problem in the @xmath311 system with @xmath310 an odd integer ( e.g. , the @xmath126 system when @xmath312 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the ground state of the projected bcs hamiltonian in our approach does not suffer from the above problem regardless of site numbers .",
    "the close relationship between the projected bcs wavefunction and the ground state of the projected bcs hamiltonian at moderate doping is rather important since it provides additional support for the existence of superconductivity in the projected bcs hamiltonian and , eventually , for that of the superconductivity in the @xmath23 model through the connection between the projected bcs hamiltonian and the @xmath23 model ; large - scale monte carlo simulation studies have shown @xcite that the projected bcs wavefunction has the long - range pairing correlation in the thermodynamic limit . in this perspective , the goal of our work in this paper is to show why the projected bcs wavefunction can be a good ansatz wavefunction for the @xmath23 model at moderate doping , while it is not true at half filling .",
    "the interrelationship between the ground state of the @xmath23 model , that of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian , and the rvb state is schematically shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".interrelationship between the ground state of the @xmath23 model , @xmath313 , the ground state of the gutzwiller - projected bcs hamiltonian , @xmath314 , and the rvb state , @xmath315 .

    "the above expression suggests a very natural interpretation that the partial gutzwiller projection is , in fact , also a specific form of the usual jastrow factor .",
    "incidentally , the fermi sea state with the partial gutzwiller projection , @xmath318 , was studied previously in the context of the metal - insulator transition in the two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite .",
    "finally , it is also interesting to note that , in one dimension where there is no instability for either spin - density - wave or pairing , the exact ground state of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( i.e. , bethe ansatz solution @xcite ) is actually very closely related to the gutzwiller - projected fermi - sea state @xcite , as expected from the jastrow - factor argument .",
