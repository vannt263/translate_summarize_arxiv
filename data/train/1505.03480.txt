    "the emitted photons must traverse even larger depths where they may be scattered and absorbed .",

    "most of the radiation they produce also comes from deep within the photosphere so we need to calculate the optical depth , @xmath47 from the emission site to the earth . for @xmath0100 mev photons",
    "the main absorption is via pair production with a cross section @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the thomson scattering cross section relevant for @xmath50100 kev hxrs and @xmath51@xcite . ] .",
    "the column depth along the line of sight to the observer , @xmath52 , depends on both the position of the flare and the column depth @xmath53 penetrated by the emitting particles of energy @xmath54 .",
    "this depth is determined by the energy loss rates .",
    "high - energy electrons spiraling down a magnetic field line with a pitch angle cosine @xmath55 lose and radiate most of their energy deep in the photosphere . for @xmath56 250  mev ( lorentz factor @xmath57 ) ,",
    "the dominant energy losses are due to coulomb - ionization , whereas for @xmath58 250  mev , the radiative losses are dominated by bremsstrahlung ( over synchrotron and inverse compton ) .",
    "the total loss rate can be approximated as      with @xmath60 ( for coulomb logarithm @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 the total density . for extreme relativistic electrons @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the lorentz factor where the two losses are equal . from these , and ignoring the small deviation of @xmath65 from unity , the column depth penetrated by an electron of initial lorentz factor @xmath66 is then @xmath67 for non - relativistic electrons and protons the coulomb collision dominates and for both particles we have @xmath68    the energy dependence of the proton loss rate is similar to that of electrons .",
    "the coulomb losses dominate at low energies but for proton energies @xmath69 gev pion production becomes significant and at @xmath70 gev ( @xmath71 ) it becomes the dominant loss mechanism , and like electron bremsstrahlung , it gives @xmath72 .",
    "making the same approximation as above we get the same equations , ( [ lossrate ] ) and ( [ column ] ) , but now with @xmath73@xmath45 and @xmath74 ( for @xmath75 ) .",
    "an electron of energy @xmath76 radiates photons of energy @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , assuming that protons of energy @xmath76 produce a @xmath79 with similar energy that decays into two photons of equal energies we can again set @xmath78 ( the exact value of @xmath80 will not change our conclusions drastically ) . for relativistic electrons the radiated photons will be beamed along the pitch angle of the electrons . as shown by  @xcite",
    "there will be strong center - to - limb variation of gamma - ray flux , but for flares at a few degrees behind the limb this effect can be ignored .    for a flare at the center of the solar disk ( helio - longitude @xmath81 , or angle to the limb @xmath82 ) , the optical depth is @xmath83 and increases toward the limb at a rate that depends on the ambient density profile ; @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the distance from the center of the sun at the depth of emission @xmath53 .",
    "the photons of interest here are produced below the photosphere at column depths @xmath87 @xmath45 and densities @xmath88 @xmath89 , where both quantities increase exponentially with a scale height @xmath90 .",
    "consequently , most of the contribution comes from within a scale height at a radius @xmath91 corresponding to the column depth @xmath92 described above .",
    "if we define @xmath93 and @xmath94 we get @xmath95 for occulted flares @xmath96 . since @xmath97 most of the contribution to this integral comes from very small @xmath98 so we can use the approximation @xmath99 .",

    "for a 50 kev photon emitted by a @xmath109 and @xmath110 kev electron ( and using the thomson cross section ) we find @xmath111 at the center of the disk , @xmath112 at the limb , and a rapid increase as @xmath113 for a behind - the - limb flare . at @xmath114and @xmath115 km , the optical depth is @xmath116 .    for gamma rays",
    "the optical depth is considerably larger because they are emitted deeper in the photosphere . for a flare near the center of the solar disk the optical depth for a 100 mev photon , emitted either by a @xmath117 mev electron or @xmath118 mev proton ,",
    "is about 0.2 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "but for a flare at the limb these values increase by @xmath119 . for reasonable average pitch angles @xmath120 and even if we include the effects of non - radial field lines this could give @xmath121 .",
    "once the flare source region moves behind the limb , the optical depth increases exponentially as @xmath122 making the detection of any flare for @xmath123impossible .",
    "this is also true for the 1 to 10 mev bgo photons even though the protons producing them do not penetrate as deeply .",
    "considering that the flare occurred at @xmath110behind the limb , we conclude that this scenario is untenable .",
    "the key feature of this behind - the - limb flare is the detection of @xmath0100 mev emission for @xmath130 minutes . to explain this observation",
    ", we also consider the scenario where the photons are produced in the corona by high - energy particles injected promptly into a magnetic trap  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath124 cm ( minimum height needed for a source @xmath110@xmath9 behind the limb to be visible above the limb ) above the transition region . for particles to be trapped efficiently we need sufficiently strong field convergence to trap most particles and a low level of turbulence so that the scattering time would be much longer than the energy loss time",
    "otherwise most of the particles will be scattered into the loss cone and radiate deep in the solar atmosphere as in scenario  [ sec : belowphotosphere ] .",
    "let us first consider protons with an energy loss rate given by eq .",
    "( [ lossrate ] ) with @xmath125 @xmath45 and @xmath74 .",
    "this gives an energy loss time for a 1 gev proton of @xmath126 so for the observed duration of @xmath127 s we need a density @xmath128 which is what one encounters below the occulted transition region and not at @xmath129 cm above it .",
    "the energy loss rate for electrons in the coronal region is dominated by coulomb collisions at low energies and synchrotron losses for magnetic fields @xmath130 g or inverse compton losses at lower fields .",
    "this rate is again described by eq .",
    "( [ lossrate ] ) but with @xmath131 @xmath45 and @xmath132 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this gives rise to flat spectra at low energies and a sharp cutoff at @xmath133 with these electrons carrying most of the energy with the longest lifetime of @xmath134 .",
    "for the production of @xmath135  mev photons we need electrons with @xmath136 so that for a lifetime of 30 minutes we need @xmath137 and @xmath138 25 g. while these values for the density ( magnetic field ) are somewhat higher ( lower ) than the ones found at 10@xmath139 cm above the transition region , they can not be fully ruled out .",
    "also , a photon index @xmath140 requires injected electrons with spectral index -1 ( for a thin target case ) , which is much harder than those encountered at lower energies .",
    "thus , this model requires strong convergence , low turbulence and hard spectra . in view of the lat detection of sol2014 - 09 - 01",
    "flare with @xmath141 ( paper in preparation ) that requires a trap at a height @xmath010@xmath142 cm , this model becomes less plausible .",
    "a third possibility is that particles accelerated by a shock associated with this flare originating behind the limb find their way to the photosphere visible to _ fermi_where they produce gamma - rays .",
    "this requires a magnetic connection between the acceleration site and the visible photosphere , e.g. , large overlying loops .",
    "such a connection must have been absent during the impulsive phase and for hxr - producing electrons which are most likely accelerated in smaller loops with both footpoints occulted .",
    "otherwise we would expect a detection of hxrs from the footpoints on the visible side .",
    "furthermore , the lat emission error circle allows for the gamma - ray emission to occur on the visible side of the disk .",
    "this also means that the extended - phase gamma - ray producing particles were not accelerated in small loops and , like longer lasting seps , most likely were accelerated in the shock of the cme . since the magnetic lines draping the cme are most likely connected to the occulted ar , this requires cross - field diffusion that allows migration of particles from the field lines connected to the ar to those connected to the visible disk .",
    "the presence of a strong and short scale turbulence capable of scattering the accelerated particles with a mean free path comparable to their gyro radii will facilitate this migration @xcite .",
    "a longer trapping time of accelerated particles in the downstream region , say e.g. , by converging field lines rooted at the sun , can also help this migration .",
    "this model requires further study .    in conclusion ,",
    "the multiwavelength observations of this behind - the - limb flare have provided some interesting theoretical puzzles which can be resolved by more detailed investigation of the scenarios discussed above .",
