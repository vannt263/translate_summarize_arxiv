    "quantifiers for the distance ( distinguishability ) between two density operators in the quantum state space @xmath0the space formed by positive semidefinite matrices with trace equal to one  are an essential and frequently used item in the quantum information scientist toolkit @xcite . for instance , how well a quantum system was prepared @xcite , manipulated @xcite or protected @xcite in an experiment is usually evaluated via how close ( how indistinguishable ) its real state is from what one would ideally expect .",
    "distance measures in @xmath0 naturally appear also in the contexts of quantum foundations @xcite , quantum processes @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite , quantum speed limits @xcite , quantum channel capacities @xcite , and also in the theories of quantum entanglement @xcite , quantum discord @xcite , and quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "several distance ( distinguishability ) measures in the quantum state space have been proposed in the literature in the last decades .",
    "a partial list is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . a few examples are the bures distance , that is defined in terms of a similarity measure known as uhlmann s fidelity @xcite ( for a critical assessment regarding the use of this function in quantum information science see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the @xmath1norm distance , with the trace distance ( or @xmath2norm distance ) and the hilbert - schmidt distance ( or @xmath3norm distance ) being used more frequently ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) , the quantum relative entropy @xcite , and the quantum chernoff bound @xcite , with these last two distinguishability measures being defined operationally , respectively , in the contexts of asymmetric and symmetric quantum hypothesis testing .    in this article",
    "we are interested mainly in one of the most popular distance measures , the trace distance , that is defined using the trace norm . for a hermitian matrix @xmath4 , the _ trace norm _ is defined and given as follows : @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the absolute value of the real eigenvalues of @xmath4",
    ". we can quantify how dissimilar two density operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 are by their _ trace distance _",
    "( td ) , which is defined as the trace norm of their subtraction , @xmath9 and assumes values between zero and two @xcite .",
    "this mathematical function possesses several of those properties required for a faithful distance ( distinguishability ) measure in the quantum state space @xcite : for the density operators @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 , the trace distance is , e.g. , positive semidefinite ( @xmath11 ) , it is zero if and only if the two density operators are equal ( @xmath12 ) , it is symmetric ( @xmath13 ) , it obeys the triangle inequality ( @xmath14 ) , it is invariant under unitary transformations ( @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 identity matrix ) , it leads to the equality @xmath19 , it is monotonic under discarding subsystems ( @xmath20 with @xmath21 ) , and it is consequently also monotonic under trace - preserving quantum operations ( @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .    notwithstanding ,",
    "it was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that the trace distance lacks monotonicity under taken tensor products of its arguments . that is to say , we can find four density operators @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 such that the following inequalities are satisfied : @xmath27 this non - monotonicity under tensor products ( nmutp ) does not seem to be a desirable property for a distance measure in @xmath0 .",
    "if a pair of states of a quantum system is more distinguishable than another pair of states , one would expect the same to hold for two identical and uncorrelated copies of the system prepared in those states .    two relevant questions to answer regarding this issue are ( i ) for what kind of state and ( ii ) how often the inequalities in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ineq0 ] ) and ( [ eq : ineq1 ] ) can simultaneously hold .",
    "the remainder of this article will be devoted to answer these questions for the cases of general state vectors ( sec . [ pure ] ) , for one - qubit states ( sec .",
    "[ mixed_1qb ] ) , and also for high - dimensional quantum systems ( sec .",
    "[ mixed_1qd ] ) .",
    "this section is dedicated to investigate such an issue considering some particular classes of states .",
    "though we present some analytical results , much of the work should be numeric .",
    "we will start using general pure states and a two - level quantum system to address the question ( i ) . in the sequence the question ( ii ) will be studied mainly with regard to its dependence with the system s dimension .",
    "let @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 be arbitrary state vectors on the discrete hilbert space @xmath28 of dimension @xmath29 .",
    "the trace distance between the pair of states @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be written as @xcite : @xmath32 given that @xmath33 , @xmath34 implies @xmath35 .",

    "let us consider the special case in which the pairs of density operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , individually , collinear .",
    "that is to say , let e.g. @xmath40 with the two bloch s vectors being @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is any unit vector in @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the pauli s vector .",
    "one can readily show that @xmath46    for the tensor products we have @xmath47 where we used @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is straightforward applying eq .",

    "the computations of eigenvalues involved in this article are done utilizing the lapack subroutines ( see ref .",

    "the mersenne twister pseudo - random number generator @xcite is applied to produce these numbers . by setting the euclidean norm of the bloch s vector equal to one ( zero ) we obtain pure ( maximally mixed ) states . for the sake of illustration ,",

    "the mean value of td in the three cases are , respectively , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . ]",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning at this point that we have made several tests from which we found that the numerical and analytical results for the td coincide up to the fifteenth digit when applied to random states in those classes considered in secs .",
    "[ mixed_1qb_1 ] and [ pure ] .",
    "more specifically , we generated one million pairs of random collinear states ( @xmath74 ) and one million pairs of random pure states ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) for each value of the system dimension ( with @xmath75 ) .",
    "the error , in each case , is computed by comparing the trace distance obtained via diagonalization with the lapack subroutines and the value of td obtained using its analytical expression .",
    "then the precision is established via the worst case error .",
    ".percentage of the @xmath76 quartets of randomly - generated one - qubit states leading to the nmutp drawback of trace distance . in the last three columns are presented the average value , standard deviation , and maximum value of the strength of the nmutp drawback of td , as defined in eq .",

    "we draw an example of such a quartet of states .",

    ", when applicable , we will define the following quantity : @xmath81 the quantity @xmath82 measures how far the td is from been monotonic under tensor products . as @xmath82",
    "is defined only for those quartets of states leading to the nmutp of td , its lower bound is zero . in order to access more details about the distribution of @xmath82",

    "even with these additional informations , as can be seem in table [ table_1qb ] , in the general case the relationship between the existence of the nmutp drawback of td and the classes of states involved is not an easy matter .",
    "for instance , starting with general states and then restricting one of them to be pure we pass from a percentage of @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "but then the addition of the same restriction for one state of the other pair reduces the percentage with the undesired property of td to @xmath91 .",
    "several other similar nontrivial changes in the percentages can be identified .",
    "one striking one is that in the last line of the table . for four pure states",
    "there is no drawback , however just by putting one of the states in the center of the bloch s ball , we get a percentage of @xmath92 , the second higher among the classes of one - qubit states studied .",
    "these results stress the richness and complexity of the quantum state space , already for the composition of two of its simplest systems .",
    "thus , in order to simplify the analysis , we will investigate in the next section the general dependence of the nmutp drawback of td with the dimension of the system .          in this subsection we shall study the nmutp drawback of trace distance for @xmath93level quantum systems , known as qudits . as there is no explicit parametrization for density matrices with @xmath94 @xcite",
    ", we will proceed as follows .",
    "let us first look for the spectral decomposition of a given density operator @xmath53 : @xmath95 once the eigenvalues of @xmath96 form a probability distribution , i.e. , @xmath97 we can use a geometric parametrization for them @xcite : @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",

    "we use the hurwitz s parametrization with euler s angles .",
    "for details see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .    .",
    "the nmutp average percentage of the whole sample with ten sets of @xmath76quartets of states is shown at the side of @xmath29 .",
    "the blue line indicates @xmath83 . ]    by creating pseudo - random probability distributions @xmath100 and pseudo - random unitary matrices",
    "@xmath103 , we did ten numerical experiments for each value of the system s dimension @xmath29 generating one million quartets of states in each experiment .",
    "the mean , minimum , and maximum values of the percentages of the quartets of states leading to nmutp of td are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nmutp ] . in the fig .",
    "[ fig_distg_d ] we present samples of the distribution of values of the drawback s strength for some values of @xmath29 .",
    "we can see in these figures a steady decreasing of such a proportion and strength as the system dimension @xmath29 grows .",
    "the trace distance has several good properties that rank it as one of the major distance measures between quantum states .",
    "nevertheless , it also presents a potential drawback , the possibility of being non - monotonic under taking tensor products of its arguments , that was shown in this article to exist for a non - negligible fraction of the density matrices investigated .",
    "thus , although such issue seems not to be much relevant for high - dimensional quantum systems , it must be taken into account when dealing with few qubits .",
    "the important question that yet remains is if , in the cases were the nmutp of td is significant , it has some undesirable consequence for important functions in quantum information science .",
    "the possible implications of this issue regarding , for instance , the quantification of quantum entanglement , of quantum discord , and of quantum coherence is an appealing topic for further researches",
