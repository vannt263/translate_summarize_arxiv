    "the striking pattern of neutrino mass and mixing parameters  @xcite , remarkably at odds with that characterizing the quark sector , suggests that it can hardly be expected to happen just by chance . by and large , in the attempt to bring a rationale to the pattern of fermion mixing , theorists have focused on the idea that there is some yet - to - be - determined non - abelian flavor symmetry of nature . theoretical work towards predicting flavor parameters has followed two complementary paths , namely :    * building explicit flavor models on a case - by - case basis  @xcite * focussing upon the residual cp symmetries characterizing the final mass matrices , irrespective of the details of the underlying theory  @xcite    in both cases a number of predictions for the leptonic mixing matrix can be made .",
    "specially interesting for phenomenology are those which imply a correlation between the leptonic jarlskog invariant @xmath5\\ ] ] and the atmospheric angle , since @xmath6 and @xmath3 are the two less precisely determined of all the neutrino oscillation parameters .    despite enormous experimental effort since the discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite",
    ", we are still far from a high precision measurement of the leptonic cp phase characterizing neutrino oscillations within the three flavor paradigm  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on a model where neutrino oscillations are , to a good approximation , described in terms of a unique parameter that may be taken as @xmath6 .    for definiteness , we focus upon symmetry based flavor models .",
    "we consider the case of a full - fledged warped model construction incorporating flavor symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it provides an explicit proof - of - concept , realizing a realistic and `` natural '' scheme providing a complete description of all fermion masses as well as their mixing angles and phases .",
    "all mass hierarchies are naturally accounted for by warping .",
    "thanks to the underlying @xmath0 flavor symmetry , the model implies a predictive pattern of lepton mixing parameters , while adequately fitting the quark mixing matrix . here",
    "we determine the implications of the model for neutrino oscillations , deriving the manifest correlation between @xmath2 and the atmospheric angle @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the determination of leptonic cp violation is no longer unique but exhibits a fourfold degeneracy .",
    "this is used to work out the predicted electron neutrino and anti - neutrino appearance probabilities for the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments t2k , nova and the upcoming dune  @xcite experiment .",
    "here the main idea consists in combining the advantages of warping in order to account for mass hierarchies without fine tuning , with those of implementing flavor symmetries , in order to potentially predict the fermion mixing pattern . for definiteness",
    "we focus on the warped flavor model proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the model is a minimal version of the randal - sundrun ( rs ) model involving compactification of the fifth dimension on @xmath7 and attaching the orbifold to @xmath8 ( uv brane ) and @xmath9 ( ir brane ) .",
    "the warped five - dimensional @xmath10 metric is given as @xmath11 where @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 is the curvature scale parameter .",
    "we employ the most minimal version of the rs model with non - custodial @xmath14 bulk eletroweak symmetry where the 5d fermions and the higgs field , @xmath15 , are allowed to propagate into the bulk .",
    "although models with a brane - localized higgs and no custodial symmetry are severely constrained by electroweak precision tests  @xcite the conflict with electroweak and flavour physics constraints can be significantly reduced when the 5d higgs field lives in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "this offers a way to account for fermion mass hierarchies while evading eletroweak and flavour physics restrictions . besides the usual sm states",
    ", 4 extra scalars are added to the model , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , all of which acquire vacuum expectation values .",
    "it has been shown that charged lepton as well as dirac neutrino masses are generated at leading order  @xcite . moreover",
    ", all fermion mass hierarchies can be adequately described by appropriate choices of bulk mass parameters  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "neutrino masses are generated by interactions in the ir brane of the form @xmath18 . as a result ,",
    "the double vev of the scalars and the localization of the interaction can naturally account for their smallness .",
    "concerning the mixing angles , a beautiful feature of the model consists in the integration of its extra - dimensional nature with the implementation of a non - abelian flavor symmetry , in our case @xmath19 .",
    "the latter leads to the prediction of all the 4 neutrino oscillation parameters in terms of just two angles : @xmath20 and @xmath21 according to the following equations ,    [ eq : predict1 ] ^2_12= & + [ eq : predict2 ] ^2_13=&(1 + 2 _ _ ) + [ eq : predict3 ] ^2_23= & + [ eq : predict4 ] j_cp=&-2 _ ,    where @xmath22 is the jarlskog invariant .",
    "these relations were derived in  @xcite and they imply that the theory can be directly probed using low energy neutrino oscillation experiments by comparing the above predicted relations , given in terms of the two free parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with the measured oscillation parameters . indeed , the allowed parameter region consistent with current oscillation data  @xcite can be determined and was given in @xcite . here",

    "<S> here we study the pattern of neutrino oscillations emerging from a previously proposed warped model construction incorporating @xmath0 flavor symmetry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a complete description of fermion masses , the model predicts the lepton mixing matrix in terms of two parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the good measurement of @xmath1 makes these two parameters nearly proportional , leading to an approximate one - parameter description of neutrino oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> there is a sharp fourfold degenerate correlation between @xmath2 and the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath3 , so that maximal @xmath3 also implies maximal leptonic cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted electron neutrino and anti - neutrino appearance probabilities indicate that the model should be tested at the t2k , no@xmath4a and dune long baseline oscillation experiments . </S>"
