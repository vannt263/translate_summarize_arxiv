    "during the last decade , carbon nanotubes have shown a great potential for the development of molecular electronics .",
    "this comes from their versatile electronic properties , which depend on variables like the helicity of the tubule , the temperature , or the contacts used in the experiments .",
    "it is well - known for instance that the carbon nanotubes may have semiconducting or metallic behavior , depending on the roll - up direction of the wrapped hexagonal carbon lattice@xcite .",
    "this has opened the way for the construction of intramolecular junctions behaving as electronic devices at the nanometer scale@xcite .",
    "given their reduced dimensionality , the metallic nanotubes behave as strongly correlated electron systems , with different regimes depending on the energy scale . at room temperature , for instance",
    ", the strong coulomb repulsion prevails in nanotubes of typical radius , driving the electron system to a state with the properties of the so - called luttinger liquid , characterized by the absence of electron quasiparticles at the fermi level .",
    "this feature manifests in the power - law dependence of observables such as the tunnelling density of states , whose suppression at low energies has been actually observed in measurements of the conductance in the carbon nanotubes@xcite .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the behavior of the carbon nanotubes depends on the contacts used in the transport measurements .",
    "when the contacts are not highly transparent , there is in general a suppression of the zero - bias conductance and the differential conductivitiy , characteristic of the coulomb blockade regime . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been experiments using high - quality contacts where it has been possible to observe superconducting correlations in the carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "the most remarkable signature has been the appearance of supercurrents in nanotube ropes suspended between superconducting electrodes@xcite .",
    "this feature may be understood as a consequence of the proximity effect , by which cooper pairs are formed in the nanotubes near the superconducting electrodes@xcite .",
    "moreover , superconducting transitions have been measured in ropes suspended between metallic , nonsuperconducting electrodes@xcite .",
    "these observations imply the existence of a regime with a relevant attractive component in the electron - electron interaction , coming presumably from the exchange of phonons between electronic currents@xcite .",
    "> from a theoretical point of view , it is well - known that the luttinger liquid regime may break down in the carbon nanotubes , due to a variety of low - temperature instabilities@xcite . when the effective phonon - mediated interactions are taken into account , it can be shown that the superconducting correlations may grow large upon suitable screening of the coulomb interaction in the nanotubes@xcite .",
    "this has raised the hopes that such correlations could be amplified by considering nanotube geometries with enhanced electron - phonon couplings .",
    "the case of the small - diameter nanotubes , with radius down to @xmath5 , is particularly interesting in that respect , since the large curvature of the tubule increases significantly the coupling to the elastic modes of the nanotube lattice@xcite .",
    "the transport properties of small - diameter nanotubes have been studied in the experiment reported in ref . , where it has been claimed evidence for a superconducting transition at about @xmath6 .",
    "it is uncertain however whether the observed features should be ascribed to the presence of nanotubes with the ( 5,0 ) or the ( 3,3 ) geometry , both being consistent with the measured nanotube radius .",
    "moreover , it remains also unclear the physical meaning of the estimated transition temperature , as the nanotubes in the experiment are placed in the channels of a zeolite matrix that does not allow coherent electron hopping between the nanotubes .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the instabilites that may lead to the breakdown of the luttinger liquid in the small - diameter zig - zag nanotubes .",
    "we are going to focus on the analysis of the ( 5,0 ) nanotubes , which deserve special attention as they have three subbands crossing the fermi level ( in the undoped system ) .",
    "the position of the different fermi points in momentum space is shown in fig .",
    "[ brillo ] .",
    "they correspond to two degenerate subbands with opposite values of the angular momentum around the nanotube axis ( denoted by 1,2 ) and a third subband with zero angular momentum ( labelled by 0 in the figure ) .",
    "the fermi velocity is different in the nondegenerate and the degenerate subbands , being smaller in either case than for nanotubes of normal radius and leading to an enhanced density of states at low energies . for the degenerate subbands ,",
    "the fermi velocity becomes @xmath7 , while for the nondegenerate subband we have @xmath8 .",
    "a diagram with the different shapes of the subbands along the momentum in the longitudinal direction is shown in fig . [ threebnd ] .",
    "together with the enhanced density of states at low energies , the large curvature of the tubule makes the ( 5,0 ) geometry the most appealing instance to study the effects of large electronic correlations in the carbon nanotubes .",
    "we will apply renormalization group methods@xcite to discern the low - energy instabilities of the electron system with three subbands at the fermi level , extending the analysis carried out in refs . and for typical nanotubes with two low - energy subbands .",
    "this will allow us to study the growth of several response functions marking the tendency towards long - range order , including charge - density - wave ( cdw ) modulations with different values of the momentum and superconducting instabilities with different order parameters .",
    "( in the undoped system).,height=188 ]    our analysis will stress the relevance that the screening of the coulomb interaction has for the development of different instabilities in the small - diameter nanotubes . for a single nanotube , placed in general above some substrate",
    ", there is little reduction of the coulomb potential , which remains long - ranged in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) system@xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction has then a strong effective coupling , much larger than that of the effective phonon - mediated interaction , so that the coulomb repulsion plays the dominant role dictating the electronic properties about room temperatures .",
    "we will use bosonization methods@xcite to achieve an exact treatment of the contributions from the coulomb interaction at small momentum - transfer , capturing the effects of the strong coulomb repulsion at the nonperturbative level .",
    "the contributions from the effective phonon - exchange interactions will be analyzed next , assessing their enhancement at low energies from the nontrivial scaling of the backscattering interaction channels .",
    "on the other hand , we will pay also attention to the particular conditions in the experiment reported in ref . .",
    "each nanotube is embedded there in a large three - dimensional ( 3d ) array of nanotubes .",
    "thus , the electrostatic coupling between charges in the different nanotubes leads to a large screening of the coulomb potential .",
    "we will study this effect by using a kind of generalized rpa scheme , taking into account the coulomb interaction between all the nanotubes in the 3d array .",
    "we will show that , over distances much larger than the intertube separation , there is a regime where the nanotube array screens effectively as a 3d system , rendering short - ranged the coulomb potential within each nanotube .",
    "this is the most important effect of the environment in the particular experimental setup described in ref . .",
    "we will see that the strong reduction of the coulomb interaction leads then to the prevalence of charge instabilities with similar character to the wentzel - bardeen singularity@xcite .",
    "we may compare the results of our investigation with those obtained for the small - diameter zigzag nanotubes by means of _ ab initio _ simulations@xcite and mean - field - like calculations@xcite . in ref .",
    ", a superconducting instability has been found to be dominant in the ( 5,0 ) nanotubes , at a scale of about @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "a cdw instability has been identified in the same geometry at room temperature in ref . .",
    "our results stress that the scale and the type of electronic instability are very sensitive to the degree of screening applied to the nanotubes .",
    "we will find indeed that single ( 5,0 ) nanotubes ( with just some screening from nearby gates ) undergo the breakdown of the luttinger liquid regime in favor of a cdw modulation at low energies .",
    "this is quite different from the instability found in the 3d array of nanotubes . in either case",
    ", we will see that the onset of the electronic instability takes place at temperatures ranging from @xmath1 up to @xmath10 , depending on the dielectric constant of the environment .",
    "as a first approximation to the electronic properties of the small - diameter nanotubes , we begin our analysis by focusing on the effects of the strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "this is the dominant interaction in scattering processes at low momentum - transfer .",
    "following ref . , we take the coulomb potential in the wrapped geometry as @xmath11+a_{z}^{2 } } } \\label{potent}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the nanotube radius .",
    "the effective strength of the interaction depends on the dielectric properties of the environment hosting the nanotubes . in general",
    ", we will encode the screening effects from external gates in the dielectric constant @xmath0 .",
    "we have to bare in mind , however , that this procedure is suitable for the description of single nanotubes , while it has to be appropriately improved for systems made of a manifold of nanotubes , as we will see in sec .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath14 of the potential ( [ potent ] ) reflects the long - range character of the interaction at small momentum - transfer .",
    "thus , it has a logarithmic dependence at small longitudinal momentum @xmath15 , which is characteristic of the 1d coulomb potential in momentum space@xcite : @xmath16 @xmath17 is in general of the order of the inverse of the nanotube radius @xmath13 , as it is the memory that the electron system keeps of the finite transverse size , after projection of the 3d potential onto the longitudinal direction of the tubule .",
    "the strength of the coulomb interaction can be estimated from the dimensionless ratio @xmath18 , which for the small - diameter nanotubes is of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "this gives a measure of the relevance of the coulomb interaction , which turns out to be in the strong - coupling regime in the forward - scattering channels .    before going ahead ,",
    "we proceed next to make a complete catalogue of the different interaction channels .",
    "we first borrow the classification that has been already made for metallic nanotubes with a pair of subbands at the fermi level@xcite .",
    "thus , we introduce respective coupling constants @xmath20 for the channels involving processes between the two inner subbands of the small - diameter nanotubes .",
    "the lower index discerns whether the interacting particles shift from one subband to the other @xmath21 , remain at different subbands @xmath22 , or they interact within the same subband @xmath23 .",
    "the upper label follows the same rule to classify the different combinations of left - movers and right - movers .",
    "the above set of couplings @xmath20 has to be supplemented with the couplings for the channels involving processes between a particle at one of the degenerate subbands and another at the nondegenerate subband .",
    "now we can discern between interactions that keep each particle within its respective subband , to which we assign a coupling @xmath24 for particles of opposite ( like ) chirality , and backscattering interactions that lead to the exchange of the subbands for the two particles , which we label with a coupling @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , we have also the channels in which the particles interact within the outer subband , and that we will label as in the usual @xmath26-ology description , in terms of the couplings @xmath27 and @xmath28 . finally , there are also interaction processes in which two particles with about zero total momentum exchange their position from the outer to the inner subbands , or vice versa , as depicted in fig .",
    "we will assign the coupling @xmath29 to that kind of interaction with no change of chirality of the particles , and the coupling @xmath30 when there is a change in their chirality .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that , despite the role they may have in the enhancement of some type of correlations , these interactions labelled by @xmath29 and @xmath30 have been overlooked in previous studies of the ( 5,0 ) nanotubes@xcite .        focusing again on the forward - scattering interactions , we may represent their contribution to the hamiltonian of the electron system introducing the charge and spin density operators @xmath31 which correspond to the different electron fields @xmath32 for the linear branches about the fermi points shown in fig .",
    "[ threebnd ] .",
    "we adopt a notation in which the index @xmath33 is used to label the left- or right - moving character of the linear branch , and the index @xmath34 to label the subband .",
    "we will assume that the interaction mediated by phonon exchange ( as well as the coulomb interaction ) does not depend on the spin of the interacting electrons , so that we will carry out the discussion in terms of the charge density operators .",
    "for the sake of organizing the different forward - scattering interactions , it is convenient to define the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of corresponding density operators in the two degenerate subbands : @xmath35 with this change of variables , the hamiltonian for the forward - scattering interactions can be written in the form @xmath36 where @xmath17 stands again for the momentum cutoff dictated by the transverse size of the nanotube .    in order to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) , we introduce the fields @xmath37 ( and their respective conjugate momenta , @xmath38 ) having the following relation with the electron density operators : @xmath39 in terms of these fields , we can write the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) in the form @xmath40 the renormalized velocities @xmath41 and charge stiffnesses @xmath42 are given by the equations @xmath43    at this stage , the hamiltonian ( [ hambf ] ) can be brought to diagonal form by : i ) applying a simple canonical transformation @xmath44 and ii ) making an additional rotation to disentangle the @xmath45 sector : @xmath46 where the parameters @xmath47 are evaluated in appendix a. the important point is that , at the end , the excitations of the system governed by the hamiltonian ( [ hambf ] ) are given by charge fluctuations , with velocities strongly renormalized by the interactions , and which constitute the whole spectrum together with the spin fluctuations propagating with the unrenormalized velocities @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the picture that we have just developed corresponds to the luttinger liquid regime of the electron system , in which the main physical properties are given by the charge stiffnesses in the different sectors and by the velocities of the charge and spin fluctuations@xcite .",
    "these parameters may be used , for instance , to characterize the compressibilities in the symmetric , antisymmetric and zero angular - momentum sectors , which turn out to be proportional to the respective charge stiffnesses .",
    "the luttinger liquid behavior in the carbon nanotubes holds at energies where there is approximate linear dispersion of the different subbands crossing the fermi level .",
    "this places typically an upper scale @xmath50 of the order of @xmath51 . in the case of single nanotubes ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the forward - scattering couplings in ( [ ham2 ] ) comes from the strong coulomb potential in ( [ coulomb ] ) , with some infrared cutoff which is dictated in general by the longitudinal size of the nanotube@xcite .",
    "this leads to values of the charge stiffnesses that are typically smaller than 1 and in agreement with the experimental observations of luttinger liquid behavior in the carbon nanotubes@xcite . for energy scales",
    "much lower than @xmath50 , however , the rest of interaction channels neglected in the above analysis may become as important as the forward - scattering channels .",
    "this is possible as the strength of the 1d interactions depends in general on the energy scale of the interaction processes@xcite .",
    "electronic instabilities are then expected when some of the backscattering interactions leave the weak - coupling regime as the temperature or other relevant energy scale is lowered , as we analyze next in the case of the small - diameter ( 5,0 ) nanotubes .",
    "the small - diameter nanotubes are systems where the backscattering interactions may lead to a significant enhancement of the electronic instabilities . due to the large curvature of the tubes ,",
    "the electron - phonon couplings turn out to be much larger than for nanotubes of typical radius .",
    "this leads consequently to a larger electron - electron interaction mediated by the exchange of phonons . in the case of single nanotubes ,",
    "this effective interaction is anyhow overcome by the strong coulomb repulsion given by the potential ( [ coulomb ] ) in the forward - scattering channels .",
    "the opposite situation is found however in the backscattering channels , as we discuss in what follows .    in general , the exchange of phonons between electronic currents gives rise to a retarded interaction , which can be represented by the effective potential obtained by integrating out the phonons in the many - body theory@xcite .",
    "if we denote the electron - phonon couplings by @xmath52 ( labelling by @xmath53 the subbands of the incoming and the outgoing electron ) , we can express the potential for the effective electron - electron interaction in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 stands for the energy of the exchanged phonon with momentum @xmath15 .",
    "the typical energy of the phonons in the optical branches ( or in the acoustic branches at large momentum - transfer ) is of the order of @xmath51 @xcite , and therefore comparable to the energy cutoff @xmath50 of the 1d electron system .",
    "this allows us to take the interaction arising from ( [ pot ] ) as a source of attraction , in the energy range where the 1d model makes sense .",
    "the electron - phonon couplings in the ( 5,0 ) nanotubes have been analyzed with great detail in ref . .",
    "it has been shown there that the couplings with greater strength correspond to intraband processes , for which the momentum - transfer is in the longitudinal direction .",
    "following for instance the results of that reference for the backscattering processes within subband 1 ( or subband 2 ) , we find that the strength of the effective electron - electron interaction with @xmath56 momentum - transfer is given by the coupling @xmath57 after summing over the different phonon modes with nonvanishing electron - phonon coupling@xcite .",
    "similarly , for backscattering processes within the nondegenerate subband we find the effective coupling @xmath58 the first of these values represents the contribution of the attractive phonon - mediated interaction to the couplings @xmath59 and @xmath60 , while the second value provides the contribution to the coupling @xmath61 . making similar estimates of the electron - phonon couplings and frequencies at large transverse momentum - transfer , we have found that the couplings for the rest of backscattering interactions @xmath62 and @xmath30 are given by @xmath63 .    to each of these backscattering contributions",
    ", one has to subtract an opposite correction from the coulomb interaction .",
    "this is given by the fourier transform @xmath64 of the potential in ( [ potent ] ) at the corresponding momentum - transfer , with an additional factor of reduction that comes from the particular structure of the bloch functions in the small - diameter nanotubes@xcite . in general , the larger contributions from the coulomb potential are found in the channels with the smaller momentum - transfer .",
    "the forward - scattering channels deserve special consideration , as the potential ( [ coulomb ] ) has to be evaluated with a cutoff at small @xmath15 .",
    "as already mentioned , this is provided in general by the length @xmath65 of the experimental samples , so that a sensible estimate is given typically by a spatial average of the potential @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .    in this section",
    "we analyze the instabilities of single nanotubes , so that we can disregard for the moment any kind of intertube interaction .",
    "then , taking into account the contributions from the phonon - exchange and the coulomb interaction , we obtain the following values for the couplings in the different interaction channels : @xmath68 we note again that the different contributions from the coulomb interaction ( with a @xmath69 reduction in each case ) correspond to the pertinent choices of the momentum - transfer in the evaluation of @xmath14 .",
    "the relevance of the backscattering interactions comes from the fact that they give rise to quantum corrections that depend logarithmically on the energy scale . in the case of the @xmath59 interaction , for instance , the bare coupling",
    "is corrected to second order by the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig31 ] . by following the renormalization group program , we translate the logarithmic dependence on energy of the terms in the diagrammatic expansion into the scale - dependence of renormalized coupling constants@xcite . up to terms quadratic in the backscattering interactions , we find the complete set of scaling equations @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the anomalous dimension @xmath73 depends on @xmath74 and @xmath75 as shown in appendix a. in the above equations , the variable @xmath76 stands for minus the logarithm of the energy ( temperature ) scale measured in units of the high - energy scale @xmath77 of the 1d model ( of the order of @xmath51 ) .",
    "the equations for the @xmath20 couplings correspond to those already written for a model with two subbands in ref . .",
    "here we have incorporated a nonperturbative improvement of the equations by writing the exact dependence of the anomalous dimensions on the forward - scattering couplings through the @xmath78 and @xmath79 parameters .",
    "this is essential to deal with the strong - coupling regime of the forward - scattering interactions in the case of single small - diameter nanotubes .",
    "another important novelty is that the equations for the couplings in the degenerate and the nondegenerate subband mix through the couplings @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which had been overlooked however in previous analyses of the ( 5,0 ) nanotubes",

    "the essential point is that the scaling equations reflect the strong screening that the couplings undergo at low energies , which leads them to a regime of large attraction . to find the dominant instability in the electron system ,",
    "one has to look at the behavior of the different response functions @xmath80 , which are catalogued in appendix b. the regime of attraction leads to the large growth of some of the @xmath80 ; this points at a tendency towards long - range order , that can not be completed anyhow at any finite frequency in the 1d system .",

    "the largest growth for the respone functions corresponds to @xmath91 , with large momentum connecting opposite fermi points of the degenerate subbands ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we can understand this finding by looking at the competition between the phonon - exchange and coulomb contributions in the different channels . at small @xmath84 ,",
    "the couplings for large transverse momentum - transfer ( @xmath92 ) are attractive from the very beginning ( see eq.([l ] ) ) .",
    "in particular , the flow is dominated by @xmath93 , which is driven to large attraction , leading to a rapid growth of @xmath91 .    anyway , as shown in fig.[fig33a ] , the @xmath91 grow large only for small values of @xmath84 ( @xmath94 for nanotubes in typical conditions ) . at large @xmath84",

    "finally , we observe from the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig32 ] that , while some charge and spin - density - wave response functions grow large by approaching the critical value @xmath96 ( at least for small @xmath84 ) , the superconducting response functions for different order parameters remain all small .",

    "the phonon - exchange contribution at vanishing momentum - transfer can be estimated to be very similar to the value found from ( [ 2k ] ) , showing that there is now a substantial suppression of the effects of the coulomb repulsion in the intratube forward - scattering channels .",
    "on the other hand , the intertube forward - scattering interactions are also screened due to the electrostatic coupling among the nanotubes in the array .",
    "these screening effects can be evaluated again within the rpa scheme in appendix c , with the result that they render finite the intertube screened coulomb potential at @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , the values of the intertube backscattering couplings @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be obtained from ( [ intert ] ) with @xmath125 .",
    "the new initial conditions obtained in this way read : @xmath126 we observe that the @xmath84-dependence of the screened forward - scattering couplings is qualitatively different with respect to the nonscreened interactions .",
    "in particular , we find that the intertube couplings have an approximate linear dependence on @xmath0 , at least up to @xmath127 ( see appendix c ) .",
    "the numerical integration of the scaling equations shows now a new physical regime , where the instability of the system is not characterized by the large growth of any of the response functions , but only by the divergence of the charge stiffness @xmath89 .",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig45 ] a typical flow of the dominant response functions up to the energy scale at which the divergence of the charge stiffness occurs .",
    "we note that the screening effects produced by the environment of nanotubes suppress the tendency to cdw ordering , and enhance the superconducting correlations .",
    "anyway , the values of @xmath128 do not grow large , making very unlikely that they may give rise to any observable feature .",
    "otherwise , the divergence of @xmath89 signals the onset of a regime of strong attraction , as it implies the divergence of the compressibility and density - density correlator in the corresponding sector and the vanishing of the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath129 as well .",
    "this points at the development of phase separation into spatial regions with different electronic density , in close analogy with the physical interpretation of the wentzel - bardeen singularity .",
    "the critical energy scale for this instability is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig46 ] . for the zeolite matrix of ref .",

    "the divergent luttinger liquid parameter is also indicated.,height=207 ]",
    "in this paper we have studied the electronic instabilities of the small - diameter ( 5,0 ) nanotubes , by analyzing the competition between the coulomb interaction and the effective interaction mediated by the exchange of phonons .",
    "we have built our framework on the basis that the luttinger liquid is what characterizes the normal state of the carbon nanotubes .",
    "this is a key assumption , since the low - energy excitations of the 1d electron system are given in the normal state by charge and spin fluctuations , with absence of electron quasiparticles in the spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with the power - law suppression of the conductance and the differential conductivity that has been measured in several transport experiments on carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "the deviations from this picture have to be understood as perturbations of the luttinger liquid behavior , which in general are nominally small as the strong coulomb potential at small momentum - transfer provides the dominant interaction in the system .",
    "there are however instances in which the enhancement of the backscattering interactions ( corresponding to some nesting momentum between fermi points ) leads to the breakdown of the luttinger liquid picture .",
    "this certainly happens at sufficiently small temperature , since the backscattering interactions are amplified at low energies until they reach the strong - coupling regime@xcite .",
    "there are also experimental conditions in which the strong coulomb repulsion is largely screened .",
    "the screening effects are particularly important when the nanotubes form large assemblies@xcite .",
    "this should explain for instance the appearance of a regime with superconducting correlations at low temperature in massive ropes . in this context , the increase in the curvature of the small - diameter nanotubes has to give rise to larger electron - phonon couplings@xcite , implying in turn a natural enhancement of the backscattering interactions mediated by phonon - exchange .",
    "thus , there have been good prospects to observe the effects of large electron correlations in the small - diameter nanotubes , specially in the ( 5,0 ) geometry which leads to a relatively large density of states at the fermi level .",
    "we have shown that the level of screening of the coulomb interaction plays an important role in the development of the low - energy instabilities in the ( 5,0 ) nanotubes . in the case of single nanotubes exposed to the screening by external gates ,",
    "the luttinger liquid is unstable against the onset of a strong - coupling phase with very large cdw correlations .",
    "the temperature of crossover to the new phase depends crucially on the dielectric constant @xmath0 of the environment , ranging from @xmath1 ( at @xmath2 ) up to a value @xmath3 ( reached from @xmath133 ) .",
    "the inspection of the response functions measuring the superconducting correlations shows that these do not have an appreciable growth in the regime where the cdw correlations grow large .",
    "thus , even under conditions of strong screening by external charges , the observation of any superconducting feature seems to be excluded in single nanotubes with the ( 5,0 ) geometry .",
    "the physical picture is different when we consider the case of a large array of nanotubes , of the kind patterned by the channels of the zeolite matrix in the experiments of ref . .",
    "the coupling between the nanotubes in the array leads to a large reduction of the coulomb potential , which is rendered finite at vanishing momentum - transfer .",
    "the coulomb interaction happens to be now in the weak - coupling regime , making therefore easier the destabilization of the luttinger liquid .",
    "we have found however that , before the superconducting correlations may grow large , a singularity is reached in one of the charge stiffnesses of the luttinger liquid .",
    "this implies the divergence of the compressibility in one of the charge sectors , and it has therefore the same physical interpretation as the wentzel - bardeen singularity@xcite . as the density - density correlator in each charge sector is proportional to the charge stiffness , the divergence of the latter leads to a phase where the system prefers to form electron aggregates , leaving some other regions with a defect of electron density .",
    "the possibility of a phase of this type has been already anticipated in ref . .",
    "we have established that such a phase is realized under the particular experimental conditions reported in ref .",
    ", prevailing over any superconducting instability at the transition temperatures found in our analysis .",
    "the divergence of the charge stiffness opens the possibility of having a genuine phase transition in the ( 5,0 ) nanotubes , since the above breakdown of the luttinger liquid takes place without the formation of long - range order in a continuous order parameter .",
    "we have seen that , for a choice of the dielectric constant in accordance with the experimental conditions described in ref . , the transition temperature is of the same order as the temperature of the crossover to the pseudogap regime observed in that reference .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the divergence of the charge stiffness leads to the development of a pseudogap in the single - particle spectrum .",
    "the density of states near the fermi level for electrons in subband @xmath134 scales in the luttinger liquid regime as @xmath135 with @xmath136 as given in appendix a. quite remarkably , the @xmath137-@xmath138 characteristics reported in ref . show the evolution of the curves for decreasing temperature into a power - law behavior with an increasingly large exponent .",
    "this is in agreement with the prediction obtained from ( [ dos ] ) when approaching the singularity in the charge stiffness .",
    "it becomes then plausible that the crossover to the pseudogap regime reported in ref .",
    "may correspond to the breakdown of the luttinger liquid found in the present framework .",
    "there are however other experimental features of the small - diameter nanotubes described in ref . that can not be explained in terms of the electronic instabilities",
    "we have found in the present paper .",
    "the strong diamagnetic signal measured at low temperatures has been interpreted in that reference as a consequence of entering a superconducting regime in the small - diameter nanotubes .",
    "it remains open the question of whether the armchair ( 3,3 ) nanotubes can be responsible for such a regime , or for some other type of electronic instability that may account for the strong diamagnetic signal , as some preliminary results seem to indicate@xcite .",
    "other questions that deserve attention refer to the properties of the small - diameter nanotubes when eventually assembled into other aggregates different to those considered in the present paper .",
    "it may be interesting to see the influence of intertube tunneling between small - diameter nanotubes packed to form massive ropes",
    ". it will be crucial then to discern whether the zigzag ( 5,0 ) and the armchair ( 3,3 ) nanotubes lead to different phases , and whether they may support the appearance of larger superconducting correlations than those observed in massive ropes made of typical nanotubes .",
