    "the `` twisted '' black holes recently proposed by zhang  @xcite , and further considered by chen and jing  @xcite , and by ong  @xcite , are certainly ricci - flat , and so mathematically satisfy the vacuum einstein equations . however , these `` twisted '' black holes are merely minor variants on the well - known taub  nut spacetimes  @xcite . in particular , since these `` twisted '' black holes do not fall into the standard kerr ",
    "newman class , they certainly violate the _ spirit _ of the black hole uniqueness theorems  @xcite . therefore , even without doing any specific calculation , it is clear that there must be something odd / unusual about these `` twisted '' black holes , something that violates the input assumptions going into the black hole uniqueness theorems , and that this something odd / unusual is likely to render these `` twisted '' black holes unphysical in any realistic astrophysical setting .    in the interests of clarity we shall perform a brief elementary analysis of some of the key features of these `` twisted '' black holes , somewhat along the lines of  @xcite for the kerr geometry , relating these `` twisted '' black holes to the more usual taub ",
    "nut discussion  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we shall demonstrate that :    * these `` twisted '' black holes are not globally asymptotically flat .",
    "* these `` twisted '' black holes actually connect two universes via a timelike wormhole . *",
    "these `` twisted '' black holes are causally diseased : the entire domain of outer communication is `` totally vicious ''  @xcite .",
    "( meaning the entire region _",
    "outside _ the event horizon is infested with closed timelike curves . )    to verify these assertions it is sufficient to look at the massless case , the physically problematic issues persist and if anything are actually worse in the massive case .",
    "consider the spacetime geometry  @xcite @xmath0 this manifold is ricci - flat , @xmath1 , so that it satisfies the vacuum einstein equations , and is not riemann - flat , @xmath2 , ( so it really is a curved spacetime ) .",
    "in particular the quadratic curvature invariant is not identically zero : @xmath3 ^ 2-[4ar]^2)\\over ( r^2+a^2)^6 } .\\ ] ] this spacetime is the @xmath4 sub - case of the taub  nut variant given in equation ( 12.1 ) of reference  @xcite .",
    "( the taub  nut variant given in equation ( 12.3 ) of reference  @xcite is physically different  these two taub  nut variants differ not only by a coordinate transformation , but also by a topological identification of some of the points in the manifold . )",
    "let @xmath5 and keep only the dominant terms in the metric .",
    "then @xmath6 this is not globally asymptotically flat , the `` twisting '' encoded in the @xmath7 term remains significant no matter how large @xmath8 gets .",
    "note that in this asymptotic regime @xmath9 and that this quantity becomes negative for @xmath10 in view of the asymptotic condition , this can be further approximated as either @xmath11 depending on whether one is close to the north - pole or south - pole axis of rotation .",
    "this observation implies that ( in this asymptotic region ) small azimuthal circles of constant @xmath12 and @xmath13 , encircling the axis of rotation and of radius @xmath14 , will be closed timelike curves .",
    "we shall subsequently see that the existence of closed timelike curves extends all the way down to the horizon , and in fact ultimately contaminates the entire region outside the horizon .",
    "another interesting feature of these `` twisted '' black holes  @xcite is that @xmath15 is not the `` point '' at the centre of the spacetime .",
    "instead @xmath15 corresponds to a 2-surface of finite surface area , and the @xmath8 coordinate can be extended to arbitrary negative values . to see this ,",
    "note the following :    * the metric is invariant under @xmath16 .",
    "* at @xmath15 the curvature invariant @xmath17 is finite .",
    "( in fact , in a suitable tetrad basis all the tetrad components of the riemann tensor remain finite at @xmath15 . ) * at fixed @xmath8 and @xmath18 the induced 2-metric is @xmath19 this is manifestly invariant under @xmath16 , and in particular at @xmath15 we have @xmath20 thus the `` point '' @xmath15 is actually a topological 2-sphere with finite surface area : @xmath21    combining the above , we see that negative values of @xmath8 make just as much sense as positive values of @xmath8 . that is , the natural range of the @xmath8 coordinate is @xmath22 .    by considering the zeros of @xmath23 we see that there are _ two _ horizons , located at @xmath24 .",
    "( the regions `` outside '' the two horizons are often called the nut regions  @xcite . ) by considering the zeros of @xmath25 we see that there are _ two _ ergosurfaces , located at @xmath26 .",
    "( so the ergosurfaces coincide with the horizon and the ergoregion is empty ) .",
    "the second horizon can not summarily be ignored the way it is in  @xcite .",
    "the `` bridge '' between the two horizons , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which connects the two universes has some vague similarities to a tolman wormhole  @xcite , and some vague similarities to an einstein  rosen bridge ( non - traversable wormhole )  @xcite .",
    "however it is more commonly referred to as a taub cosmology ; though perhaps taub wormhole would be better terminology .      in the region",
    "@xmath29 the @xmath8 coordinate is timelike , while the @xmath18 coordinate is spacelike . to really drive this point home ,",
    "let us restrict attention to the region @xmath29 , and simply re - label @xmath30 .",
    "then the new @xmath18 coordinate has @xmath31 and the metric becomes @xmath32 viewed in this way , with these new coordinates the region @xmath33 is an anisotropic cosmology . indeed ,",
    "since both ricci and einstein tensors are zero , this is automatically a homogeneous anisotropic cosmology , and so must fall into the bianchi classification .",
    "in fact it is bianchi type ix , and is taub s original cosmological solution  @xcite .",
    "it represents a universe undergoing a `` bounce '' in the @xmath34@xmath35 directions , but a moment of maximum expansion in the @xmath8 direction . for this reason",
    "we shall call it a taub wormhole .    indeed , the maximum analytic extension is a double tower of asymptotic nut regions , connected by multiple taub wormholes , similar to the maximum analytic extension of the reissner ",
    "nordstrm or kerr spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most physically distressing feature of these `` twisted '' black holes is the causal structure .",
    "( see reference  @xcite , or more generally  @xcite , but note that we are much less sanguine concerning this issue . )",
    "the exact formula for @xmath36 is @xmath37 as per the previous discussion for the asymptotic limit , the curves @xmath13 which encircle the rotation axis at fixed @xmath12 will be closed timelike curves whenever @xmath38 .",
    "the boundary of this specific region of closed timelike curves occurs for the closed null curves located by setting @xmath39 , which happens when @xmath40 this condition can also be recast as @xmath41 note that @xmath42 for @xmath43 , all the way to @xmath44 .",
    "so in `` our '' universe there are two `` cigars '' of these azimuthal closed timelike curves stretching along the rotation axis all the way from spatial infinity to the horizon .",
    "additionally , there are two more `` cigars '' of these azimuthal closed timelike curves in the `` other '' universe @xmath45 .      to see that these `` cigars '' of azimuthal closed timelike curves imply additional causal problems throughout the entire domain of outer communication , let us temporarily work at fixed @xmath8 and @xmath34 .",
    "the induced 2-metric on the @xmath18-@xmath35 cylinder is @xmath46 the condition for a curve @xmath47 to be timelike is then @xmath48 thus for timelike curves @xmath49 for fixed @xmath34 at large @xmath8 we have @xmath50 indicating the usual timelike cone that would be expected for a flat space .",
    "on the other hand , for fixed @xmath8 ( in either nut region ) and @xmath34 approaching the axis of rotation ( either @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) ,  we can argue as follows : there will come a stage where either one or the other of the two intervals in equation ( [ e19 ] ) , for which @xmath53 corresponds to a timelike curve , will cross the origin ( @xmath54 ) and slop over a little into the `` wrong sign '' region .",
    "this indicates that the timelike cones have `` tipped over '' to such an extent that it is now possible to choose a timelike trajectory that is initially future pointing , but such that after entering the `` tipped over '' region one can choose to follow a helical path that goes backward in the @xmath18 coordinate .",
    "by circling the rotation axis a sufficient number of times one can go arbitrarily far back in the @xmath18 coordinate .",
    "one can then leave the `` tipped over '' region , and return to one s initial starting point , producing a closed timelike curve .",
    "( see figure  [ f:1 ] . ) this can be done as long as one is initially outside the horizon ( in one of the domains of outer communication , one of the nut regions ) and never crosses the horizon  so the entire domain of outer communication is infested with closed timelike curves .",
    "that is , the entire domain of outer communication is `` totally vicious '' .",
    "the critical `` tipping point '' for the timelike cones is seen to occur at @xmath55 which is of course just a rephrasing of the condition @xmath39 , which was used to define the `` cigars '' of most manifestly obvious closed timelike curves .          to calculate the angle surfeit along the axis of rotation , note that the circumference and radius of a small disk centred on the axis of rotation are ( to sufficient accuracy ) @xmath56",
    "the angle surfeit on the axis is then @xmath57 so in this precise technical sense there is infinite excess angle along the axis of rotation ; this is yet another indication of the lack of global asymptotic flatness .",
    " we note @xmath58 indicating that the mass of the spacetime is ( in any meaningful sense ) zero .",
    "furthermore the @xmath59 christoffel symbol is @xmath60 so the coordinate acceleration of a test particle dropped at rest is inverse cube rather than inverse square .",
    "( this will change in the next section once we add a mass term . )",
    "note that the coordinate acceleration is always towards the nearest horizon .",
    "in the massive case one introduces an extra parameter @xmath61 and considers the spacetime @xmath62 this is still ricci flat , @xmath1 , and one easily calculates @xmath63 much of the previous discussion follows with only minor modifications .",
    "there is now a symmetry under the _ simultaneous _ interchange of both @xmath16 and @xmath64 .",
    "the curvature and surface area are still finite at @xmath15 , and the natural range of the @xmath8 coordinate is again @xmath22 .",
    "the horizons are again coincident with the ergosurfaces but are now located at @xmath65 note that _ both _ of these horizons should be taken into consideration ; the second horizon @xmath28 can not be summarily ignored as is done in references  @xcite .",
    "we now have @xmath66 indicating that the mass of the spacetime is indeed @xmath61 ( at least as seen from the @xmath67 side , however it is effectively mass @xmath68 as seen from the @xmath69 side ) . to check this",
    "observe that the @xmath59 christoffel symbol is @xmath70 + 2a^2r)(r^2 - 2mr - a^2)\\over ( r^2+a^2)^3 } \\approx { m\\over r^2 } + \\o(1/r^3)\\ ] ] so the coordinate acceleration of a test particle dropped at rest is now inverse square .",
    "but the dominant inverse square term in the coordinate acceleration is now towards the nearest horizon for @xmath71 , and _",
    "away _ from the nearest horizon for @xmath72 .",
    "( to see some of the physical implications of negative asymptotic mass , at least in a spherically symmetric situation , consider  @xcite . )",
    "other parts of the discussion change slightly , such as the precise location of the cigars of manifestly closed timelike circles , but the qualitative discussion remains the same .",
    "in particular the causal structure remains pathological .",
    "as we have seen , the `` twisted '' black holes of  @xcite are not really new , being minor variants of the quite well - known taub ",
    "nut spacetimes  @xcite . as mathematics , the taub ",
    "nut spacetimes are interesting examples of what can go wrong in general relativity if one blindly applies the field equations in isolation , without checking other features of the proposed spacetime  @xcite . as astrophysics , the `` twisted '' black holes exhibit a number of extremely serious pathologies that make them unlikely candidates for real astrophysical black holes .",
