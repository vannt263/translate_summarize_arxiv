    "interference effect_. usually , the discrete state is created by a defect that allows one ( or several ) additional propagation paths in the wave scattering which interact constructively or destructively . in the transmission line",

    "it describes a linear `` atomic '' chain with the nearest - neighbor interaction forces and interacting with a defect state through the nearest neighbors . in application to tight - binding models in solids , these forces are linked to a hopping probability .",
    "this simple model allows to describe the basic physics of the fano resonance in a simple way .",
    "in particular , this model allows some analytical study that may serve as a guideline for the analysis of more complicated physical models that predict the fano resonance effect .    in this paper",
    "we consider an important generalization of the fano - anderson model under the assumption that a single - site defect is nonlinear .",
    "we show that this model allows to describe _ a nonlinear fano resonance _ , and it can generate extremely high contrast between the bistable states in its transmission with low input power .",
    "we study resonant nonlinear transmission and the properties of the nonlinear fano resonance for continuous waves and pulses .",
    "we would like to mention that a typical physical situation when this model can be employed directly for describing the resonant effects is the light transmission in waveguides and waveguide junctions created in two - dimensional photonic crystals with embedded high@xmath6 resonators ( defects or cavities ) with nonlinear response . in the nonlinear regime , a defect supports one ( or several ) localized state that is characterized by a discrete eigenvalue . when the excited localized state interacts with the photonic - crystal waveguide , the system can display interference effects and fano resonance .",

    "first , we study both linear and nonlinear transmission in discrete fano - anderson models and obtain a number of explicit analytical results which allow to get a deeper understanding of the physics of this phenomenon .",
    "second , we analyze in detail the effect of nonlinearity on fano resonance and demonstrate that , first , it leads to a shift of the fano resonance frequency and , second , it can lead to bistability in the wave transmission .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our discrete nonlinear model which provides a generalization of the fano - anderson model . in section iii , we describe the main features of the fano resonance for the case of a local coupling and then study the effect of nonlinearity of the defect on the resonant transmission .",
    "in particular , we define the conditions for the bistable transmission and show that the nonlinear fano resonance can exist in a broad frequency range .",

    "one of the simplest models which describes the physics and the main features of the fano resonance is the so - called fano - anderson model  @xcite . in this paper , we use a modified version of these model described by the following hamiltonian ( see fig .

    "( [ eq5 ] ) , strength of the scattering potential depends on the incoming frequency @xmath31 , and the system should demonstrate _ resonant scattering_. if the frequency of the defect is placed in the propagation frequency band of the chain , i.e. @xmath32 , the scattering potential in eq .",

    "transmission vanishes when @xmath47 ; this happens at the edges of the continuous spectrum band , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , due to the vanishing of group velocities , and at the resonant frequency @xmath41 which , in the case of a local coupling , coincides with the discrete eigenvalue of the defect mode , @xmath50 . if the defect is coupled to two or more sites , the resonant frequency is renormalized , as discussed below .",
    "we notice that when the resonant frequency is in the middle of the propagation band , the transmission profile is symmetric ( see fig .",
