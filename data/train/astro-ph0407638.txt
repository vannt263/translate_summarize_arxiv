    "the measurement of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) flux is the goal of a wide class of past , present and future detectors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "uhe neutrinos are expected to be produced by the interaction of hadronic matter with the surrounding radiation / matter . a search for this signal is currently performed by several neutrino telescopes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "neutrinos with energy above @xmath6 ev are expected to originate from the interaction of uhe cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) _ via _ the @xmath7-photoproduction , @xmath8 , the so - called _ cosmogenic neutrinos _",
    "the prediction for such a flux is however affected by several uncertain physical quantities , namely the spatial distribution of astrophysical sources , the ejected proton fluxes ( if proton ) and the way of modelling the diffuse extragalactic electromagnetic background in the different frequency regions .",
    "one can assume a reasonable ansatz for all these quantities combined with the measurement of the diffuse photon flux in the gev region by egret @xcite , and the agasa / hires data .",
    "these models and the predictions of more exotic scenarios have been exhaustively discussed in several papers ( see for example ref.s @xcite ) .",
    "high energy neutrinos are hardly detected , as they are almost completely shadowed by earth and rarely interact with the atmosphere .",
    "an eev neutrino has an interaction length of the order of 500 km water equivalent in rock and , even crossing horizontally the atmosphere ( 360 meters water equivalent ) , only one neutrino out of thousand will be interacting . due to the very low expected flux and the small neutrino - nucleon cross section , km@xmath9-neutrino telescopes and giant surface arrays have very few chances of detection .    in this framework ,",
    "an interesting strategy for @xmath10 detection is described in ref.s @xcite@xcite . as shown for example in figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , for energy between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ev the @xmath13 decay length is not much larger than the corresponding interaction range .",
    "thus , an energetic @xmath13 , produced by charged current ( cc ) @xmath10 interaction not too deep under the surface of the earth , has a chance to emerge in the atmosphere as an upgoing particle . unlike @xmath13 s , muons crossing the rock rapidly loose energy and decay .",
    "almost horizontal @xmath10 , just skimming the earth surface , will cross an amount of rock of the order of their interaction length and thus will be able to produce a corresponding @xmath13 , which might shower in the atmosphere and be detected . in order to estimate the number of upgoing @xmath13 expected in the pierre auger observatory ( pao )",
    ", one needs to know the value of the neutrino - nucleon cross section for cc interaction , @xmath14 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to estimate the number of possible upgoing @xmath13 showers which the fluorescence detector ( fd ) of pao could detect .",
    "the predictions are analyzed with respect to their dependence on different neutrino fluxes and by using a new estimate of @xmath15 cross section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : nuflux ] different models for neutrino flux predictions are discussed . in section",
    "[ sec : nucross ] , the general features of deep inelastic neutrino cross sections are outlined for neutrino energies up to 10@xmath16 ev . in section [ sec : tauloss ] , high energy @xmath13 propagation through matter is illustrated by considering all the relevant interaction mechanisms .",
    "average values for @xmath13 energy loss are provided by taking into account the recent calculations of photonuclear interaction given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section [ sec : earthskimming ] the number of expected upgoing @xmath13 showers is derived and discussed .",
    "finally in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we give our conclusions and remarks .",
    "ultra high energy protons , with energy above @xmath17 ev , travelling through the universe mostly loose their energy _ via _ the interaction with cmb radiation .",
    "the large amount of charged and neutral pions produced will eventually decay in charged leptons , neutrinos ( _ cosmogenic neutrinos _",
    "@xcite ) , and high energy gamma rays .    at the gev energy range",
    "the extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray background was measured by the egret experiment @xcite .",
    "this measurement provides an upper bound for possible neutrino fluxes from pion production .",
    "in particular , it gives the expected maximum flux of cosmogenic neutrinos from an initial spectrum of measured uhe protons @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that , since at least part of uhecr are protons , the existence of cosmogenic neutrinos is guaranteed , even if their flux is very uncertain . in figure [ nu_gzk ] the gzk neutrino flux for three possible scenarios is plotted .",
    "the thick solid line gives the case of an initial proton flux @xmath18 , by assuming in addition that the egret flux is entirely due to @xmath7-photoproduction ( gzk - h ) .",
    "the thin solid line shows the neutrino flux when the associated photons contribute only up to 20% in the egret flux ( gzk - l ) .",
    "the dashed line stands for the conservative scenario of an initial proton flux @xmath19 ( gzk - wb ) . in this case",
    "the neutrino flux is compatible with the so  called waxman - bahcall limit @xcite . note",
    "that no lower bounds can be set for the cosmogenic neutrino flux .",
    "in particular , in the most conservative but rather unrealistic case , the astrophysical sources can not accelerate protons up to energies above gzk cutoff , and thus the secondary neutrinos will be produced in negligible quantities .",
    "all neutrino fluxes presented in this section were calculated by a propagation code @xcite which takes into account the neutrino production via @xmath7-photoproduction with microwave , infrared , optical and radio photon backgrounds , as well as in neutron decay .",
    "most of the models trying to explain highest energy cosmic rays ( @xmath20 ev ) in terms of exotic particles , predict a large associated flux of neutrinos . in figure [ nu_exotic ] , the expected neutrino flux for two of such scenarios",
    "is plotted .",
    "one of them is the model of _ new hadrons _",
    "( nh ) @xcite , with mass @xmath21 gev , capable of generating uhecr events above gzk cutoff . in susy theories , for example , the new hadrons are bound states of light bottom squarks or gluinos and , once produced in suitable astrophysical environments , can reach the earth without significant energy losses . in spite",
    "the production of new hadrons is a subdominant process , it generates a large number of neutrinos ( see figure [ nu_exotic ] ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ nu_exotic ] shows the neutrino flux for a topological defects model ( td ) ( for a review see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "uhecr events with energy @xmath20 ev are explained in terms of @xmath22 s which are produced in the decay of heavy particles with mass of the order of @xmath23 ev . as in the previous case ,",
    "the associated neutrino flux for this kind of models is extremely large .",
    "we do not discuss here the so  called z - burst scenarios , which attempts to explain uhecr as products of z - boson decay .",
    "these models are in fact strongly disfavored @xcite by the upper bounds on uhe neutrino flux put by forte @xcite and glue @xcite and by the cosmological limits on neutrino mass set by wmap and lss data @xcite .    in the following sections we will estimate the sensitivity of pao to the uhe tau neutrino flux both in the case of cosmogenic neutrinos ( figure [ nu_gzk ] ) and of exotic models ( figure [ nu_exotic ] ) .",
    "at energy above 1 gev neutrino - atoms interaction is dominated by the process of _ deep inelastic scattering _ ( dis ) on nucleons , since the contributions of both elastic and quasi - elastic interactions become negligible .",
    "the effect of the neutrino scattering with atomic electrons will not be taken into account here , since the cross section for this process is , at each energy , about three orders of magnitude lower than the neutrino - nucleon cross section production , occurring at @xmath24 pev , whose contribution to the total event rate remains nevertheless negligible  @xcite . ] .",
    "detectable leptons are produced through charged current interaction , @xmath25 whereas neutral current ( nc ) interaction causes a modulation in the spectrum of the interacting neutrinos , @xmath26 these total cross sections can be written in terms of differential ones as follows @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy of the incoming neutrino , @xmath29 is the mass of the outgoing charged lepton and @xmath30 is the inelasticity parameter , defined as @xmath31 with @xmath32 the energy of the outgoing charged ( for cc ) or neutral ( for nc ) lepton .",
    ".average inelasticity parameter for cc ( @xmath33 ) and nc ( @xmath34 ) interaction for different incoming neutrino energy .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "ultra high energy @xmath10 s ( @xmath35 ) could have real detection chance at giant surface apparatus like pao .",
    "almost horizontal tau neutrinos crossing distance in the earth of the order of their interaction length might produce @xmath13-shower earth  skimming events potentially detectable by the auger fd .    in this paper for a representative sample of @xmath10 fluxes either produced as _ cosmogenic neutrinos _ or in more exotic scenarios , the number of @xmath13-shower earth  skimming events per year expected at the fd of the pierre auger observatory has been computed . for this calculation",
    "we have used the cteq6  @xcite parton distribution functions in the dis factorization scheme and recent estimate of radiative @xmath13 energy losses in matter .",
    "a decrease of @xmath36 allows @xmath13 to emerge with a smaller nadir angle ( less horizontal ) and thus increases the number of earth  skimming events . in the relevant region of @xmath37",
    ", we essentially have @xmath38 ; thus a factor @xmath39 in the neutrino - nucleon cross section leads to an almost double number of events at fd . as a further remark",
    ", we point out that the level of theoretical uncertainties on cross - sections at extremely high energy is very large ( like in case of new physics above the tev energy region ) , due to the poor experimental knowledge of parton density functions for very small @xmath40 .",
    "the number of events per year at the fd of the pierre auger observatory is presented in table [ table::events ] for the different neutrino models reported in figure [ nu_gzk ] and [ nu_exotic ] . for a five years pao detection campaign ( south plus north )",
    "we essentially have to scale these numbers by a factor ten and thus at least the exotic models could produce detectable events . however , it is worth noticing that this estimate has been performed under a rather conservative assumption on the possibility of @xmath13 showering on the apparatus : we have used an average value for the parameter @xmath41 which essentially allows only one particle out of three to decay inside the detection fiducial volume . in a paper in progress",
    "a more sophisticated simulation is going to be performed by taking into account the real morphology of the pao site .",
    "this analysis should slightly increase the numbers presented in table [ table::events ] , which however give a reasonable estimate of the number of events at fd .",
    "we would like to thank i. a. sokalski and e. bugaev for the extremely helpful suggestions on the matter of @xmath13 photonuclear interaction .",
