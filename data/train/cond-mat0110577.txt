    "in nature there is an abundance of `` polaronic '' compounds in which , due to strong electron - phonon coupling , electrons and phonons lose , in a certain temperature and density range , their individual identity and new entities emerge : polarons @xcite .",
    "examples of current interest are , among others , the high - temperature superconducting perovskites @xcite , the `` colossal '' magneto - resistance manganites @xcite , and the titanates @xcite .",
    "the details of the actual materials notwithstanding , it is commonly assumed that , at least qualitatively , many aspects of these compounds can be understood on the basis of the holstein model @xcite supplemented by various terms , such as , e.g. , coulomb repulsion , spin - orbit coupling , and specific forms of material imperfections .    in its basic form",
    "the holstein model comprises a single tight - binding band locally coupled to dispersionless optical phonons . despite this simplicity ,",
    "the properties of the holstein model are not yet fully understood . even in the extreme dilute limit , that is the case of a single polaron in an otherwise empty band ,",
    "many basic questions remain , despite impressive theoretical progress made in recent years @xcite",
    ".    in particular , the notoriously difficult issue of trapping @xcite is far from being completely resolved .",
    "the trapping properties are only understood for the polaron _ groundstate _ of the ordered holstein model . in an important paper ,",
    "lwen @xcite has rigorously shown that the groundstate of the ordered holstein model has to be itinerant , thereby implying that the groundstate can be only trapped by an _ external _ process , e.g. , driven by material imperfections .",
    "although it is not clear whether lwen s proof also applies to _ excited _ states of the polaron , it is generally assumed that _ all _ states in the ordered holstein model are itinerant .",
    "hence , if trapping occurs , it has to be externally driven .",
    "indeed , translational invariance of the holstein model seems to force all ( eigen)states to be itinerant . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - existence of translational invariance does not necessarily prohibit itinerant states .",
    "for a single electron in a random potential , for example , itinerant states exist , separated from localized states by a `` mobility edge '' , despite the absence of translational invariance . likewise",
    ", as noted above , translational invariance per se might be no guarantee that all polaron states are itinerant .",
    "that is , the important question about the trapping properties of _ excited _ polaron states is essentially unanswered .",
    "evidently , the broad theoretical task is to construct a rigorous `` mobility - edge - theory '' for _ excited _ polaron states , treating extrinsic and ( possibly ) intrinsic trapping processes on an equal footing . in view of the complexity of this problem",
    ", we are not yet able to develop such a rigorous theory .",
    "instead , we present in this paper , as a first step , an approximate investigation of the spectral and diffusion properties of that part of the spectrum , where we expect a rigorous theory to predict a mobility edge . in particular , we investigate , in the intermediate electron - phonon coupling regime and with an approximate technique , the states comprising the high - energy edge of the lowest polaronic subband .",
    "the dispersion is extremely flat in this part of the spectrum indicating , perhaps , already the tendency of ( intrinsic ) trapping .",
    "definitely , very small amounts of disorder suffice to drive these states into the trapped regime .",
    "our investigation is based on the holstein model augmented by site - diagonal , binary - alloy type disorder .",
    "measuring energy in units of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the electronic ( nearest - neighbor ) hopping integral , the hamiltonian for the `` holstein alloy '' reads in the single - electron sector @xmath2 here , @xmath3 stands for the wannier state on site @xmath4 and @xmath5 $ ] annihilates [ creates ] an optical phonon on site @xmath4 . the phonon frequency and the electron - phonon coupling constant ( in units of @xmath0 )",
    "are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "depending on the occupancy of the site , the on - site energy ( in units of @xmath0 ) is either @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the scattering strength @xmath10 can be taken as a measure of the disorder .",
    "the independent random variables @xmath11 are drawn from a bi - modal probability distribution @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 denotes the concentration of the b sites ) .",
    "spectral properties of the model , such as the density of states , the self - energy , and the spectral function , can be deduced from the electronic two - point function , which at temperature @xmath15 and in wannier representation reads @xmath16 with an _ averaged _ one - resolvent @xmath17 here , @xmath18 denotes the one - resolvent and @xmath19 and @xmath20 stand , respectively , for averages over the quenched disorder and the phonon vacuum . henceforth , the term `` averaged '' implies , if not otherwise specified , averaged over both quenched disorder and the phonon vacuum .    from the spectral properties alone it is , in general , not possible to decide whether the states involved are itinerant ( extended ) or trapped ( localized ) .",
    "a more reliable method to discriminate between the two kinds of states is to investigate the return probability @xmath21 , i.e. , the probability to find ( in the long time limit ) the electron on the same site at which it was initially injected .",
    "this criterion has been used , for example , to characterize electronic states in a random potential @xcite . at @xmath15 and in wannier representation ,",
    "the correlation function , whose long time limit is the return probability , reads @xmath22 using abel s theorem , @xmath21 can be conveniently expressed in terms of @xmath23 , the laplace transform of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "explicitly , @xmath25 where we have defined a four - point function @xmath26 given in terms of an _ averaged _ two - resolvent , which ( for an arbitrary electronic operator @xmath27 ) reads @xmath28    the behavior of the spectrally resolved return probability , @xmath29 in the limit @xmath30 allows one to distinguish trapped from itinerant states . in particular , for a trapped polaronic defect state ,",
    "@xmath31 is finite , whereas for an itinerant polaronic quasi - particle state @xmath31 vanishes .",
    "the exact calculation of the averaged one- and two - resolvents for the holstein alloy is a rather formidable task , and , due to lack of rigorous mathematical methods , we are forced to adopt an effective single - site averaging procedure .",
    "specifically , we employ a generalized dynamical coherent potential approximation ( dcpa ) @xcite , which is known to capture the essentials of the polaron formation process .",
    "unfortunately , within the dcpa , trapped polaron states can not be unambiguously identified , because @xmath32 vanishes for _ all _ energies @xmath33 .",
    "thus , rigorously speaking , the dcpa predicts all polaron states to be itinerant .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to give a qualitative discussion of the trapping issue .",
    "in particular , an asymptotic analysis of @xmath34 for _ finite _ @xmath35 allows to define a spectrally resolved delocalization time , which is the characteristic time scale on which , at a given energy , the electron leaves a given site .",
    "according to their delocalization times , it is then possibe to distinguish between `` fast '' _ quasi - particle - like _ and `` sluggish '' , i.e. , temporarily trapped , _ defect - like _ polaron states .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii contains a general description of the dcpa with details about the calculation of the two- and the four - point functions defined above .",
    "section iii specializes the dcpa formalism to the bethe lattice with infinite coordination number and discusses representative numerical results for the spectral and diffusion properties , respectively .",
    "mathematical details not essential for the structure of the paper are relegated to two appendices .",
    "finally , we conclude in section iv with a summary of key results and open questions .",
    "in contrast to a classical alloy , where an electron experiences only elastic impurity scattering , the electron in a holstein alloy is subject to elastic impurity and inelastic phonon scattering . both scattering processes might possibly trap the electron .",
    "it is therefore necessary to treat them simultaneously . in particular",
    ", averages over the phonon vacuum and the alloy configurations need to be performed on an equal footing .",
    "a powerful tool to approximately perform these two averages is the effective single - site approximation , where one embeds an individual scatterer into an effective medium to be determined self - consistently by enforcing the scattering from a single scatterer to vanish on the average .",
    "the main advantage of this scheme is the non - perturbative treatment of on - site correlations .",
    "in particular , the non - perturbative treatment of on - site electron - phonon correlations is an essential in order to capture polaron formation .",
    "the main drawback , on the other hand , is the insufficient treatment of inter - site correlations .",
    "it is the latter which eventually makes @xmath31 to vanish for all energies @xmath33 , irrespective of the model parameters , and , thus , prevents a rigorous calculation of diffusion and trapping properties .",
    "however , as indicated in the introduction , an asymptotic analysis of @xmath34 for finite @xmath35 partly compensates for this shortcoming .    in the case of elastic impurity scattering the effective single - site approximation yields the well - known coherent potential approximation ( cpa )",
    "the dcpa , originally developed by sumi @xcite , is a direct extension of the cpa to problems involving _",
    "inelastic _ scattering .",
    "it has been primarily used to investigate linear @xcite and nonlinear @xcite optical properties of polaron - excitons in molecular crystals . however",
    ", it can be applied to any on - site inelastic scattering process .",
    "paquet and leroux - hugon @xcite employed the dcpa , e.g. , to investigate a single quantum particle subject to an on - site potential which fluctuates in time according to discrete or continuous markov processes .",
    "the cpa as well as the dcpa are mean field approximations for a single electron subject to impurity or phonon scattering , respectively .",
    "the most general mean field approximation , applicable also to dense quantum systems with mutual inelastic scattering between its constituents , is the dynamical mean field approximation ( dmfa ) @xcite . [ naturally , in the limit of a single electron , interacting with a bath ( of phonons or random scatterers ) , the dmfa reduces to the ( d)cpa . ]",
    "it can be shown , assuming that the nearest - neighbor hopping integral is scaled by a factor @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the coordination number of the lattice , that the dmfa provides an _ exact _ solution of the original model in the limit of @xmath38 .",
    "accordingly , the dmfa [ i.e. , in the respective limits , the ( d)cpa ] can be either considered as an exact theory for lattices with @xmath39 or as an approximate theory for lattices with finite @xmath37 .",
    "the dmfa has been employed by ciuchi et al .",
    "@xcite to study , in various electron - phonon coupling regimes , the groundstate and the spectral properties of a single electron in the _ ordered _ holstein model .",
    "as indicated above , for a single electron , the dmfa reduces to the dcpa .",
    "the investigations of sumi and ciuchi et al .",
    "are therefore closely related .    postponing to section iii a discussion of how our investigation complements the dcpa work by sumi @xcite and the dmfa work by ciuchi et al .",
    "@xcite , we shall now present a derivation of the generalized dcpa formalism as needed to determine two - point and four - point functions for the holstein alloy .      in the spirit of the cpa",
    "we introduce an effective medium described by an effective one - resolvent @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43    the unknown energy - dependent coherent potential ( self - energy ) operator @xmath44 defined with respect to the reference hamiltonian @xmath45 will be specified by enforcing a self - consistency condition , namely the averaged one - resolvent is forced to be equal to the averaged effective one - resolvent , i.e. , @xmath46 where we have used the configuration independence of @xmath47 .    in the above equations ,",
    "the energy variable @xmath48 denotes the _ total _ energy of the coupled electron - phonon system and not just the electron energy .",
    "the coherent potential seen by the electron , on the other hand , depends of course only on the electron energy .",
    "therefore , the energy argument of the coherent potential is the total energy @xmath48 minus the lattice energy , which is , neglecting the zero point motion of the phonons , just the total number of phonons in the system times the phonon frequency . a convenient way to ensure that the coherent potential is only a function of the electron energy is to define , following ref .",

    "note , in accordance with the spirit of the cpa , that the coherent potential @xmath55 does not contain any spatial information : it neither depends on the site nor on the spatial distribution of the excited phonons .    combining this ansatz for @xmath44 with eq .",

    "second , it indicates that even for a finite coordination number , processes which do not vanish due to the single - site self - consistency condition are at least suppressed .",
    "third , from a formal point of view , the dcpa is equivalent to the replacement of the full operator @xmath93 by a reduced operator @xmath110 containing only _ self - avoiding paths _ ( sap ) ; @xmath110 can be obtained from eq .",

    "the coherent potential @xmath55 is then adjusted in such a way that the averaged @xmath110 vanishes .",
    "this procedure can be envisaged , in physical terms , as a _ loss of spatial memory _ , because the electron `` assumes '' that each site it encounters is visited the first time , i.e. , the electron does not `` remember '' whether it has visited the site before .",
    "naturally , for a lattice with infinite coordination number , this is exact , because the probability that the electron returns to the same lattice site is vanishingly small .",
    "the replacement @xmath111 , i.e. , the erasur of the spatial memory of the electron , is of course consistent with the ansatz for the ( local ) self - energy operator . on the other hand",
    ", this replacement leads to an insufficient treatment of inter - site processes in the calculation of the averaged two - resolvent and , eventually , prevents a rigorous calculation of the diffusion and trapping properties .    keeping this shortcoming in mind",
    ", we shall nevertheless employ this formal replacement from the outset in the next subsection to simplify the calculation of the four - point function .",
    "the discussion of the previous subsection suggests that the single - site self - consistency condition is , from a formal point of view , equivalent to the replacement @xmath111 , i.e. , only saps need to be explicitly considered in the averaging procedure .",
    "we now show that this replacement allows a rather straightforward derivation of the averaged two - resolvent .    for that purpose , we first recast eq .",

    "clearly , the band flattening and the enhanced delocalization times are correlated and have , moreover , the same microscopic origin , namely the increased phonon admixture in the states at the high - energy edge of the subband .",
    "more formally , it is the _ divergence - induced _ strong @xmath205dependence of @xmath169 for @xmath178 which causes the large delocalization times at the high - energy edge of the lowest polaronic subband .    at this point",
    "it is appropriate to comment on the work of hotta and takada @xcite who suggested that for energies where the self - energy ( or , in our case , the coherent potential ) diverges , states would be trapped because of the infinitely strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "they studied the half - filled ( ordered ) holstein - hubbard model , but their conclusion is quite general and should , if valid , hold for any model which produces divergences in the self - energy .",

    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , that is , there are no states at the divergence energy which could be trapped .",
    "in contrast , our investigation suggests that , it is the effect the divergence has on states _ within _ the spectrum , namely , the band flattening it causes below the high - energy edge of the lowest polaronic subband , which could perhaps induce trapping in that particular energy range . within the dcpa , however , the effect is too weak , giving rise only to large but finite delocalization times and , hence , only to temporary trapping .",
    "it has been also suggested @xcite that , if , due to some mechanism , a finite density of states appears at the divergence energy , the corresponding states would be trapped .",
    "a finite @xmath35 simulates such a mechanism .",

    "[ fig5 ] , the maximum of @xmath34 does not occur in the tail but roughly at the maximum of the subband density of states .",

    "the concept of the delocalization time provides an appealing explanation of the spectral changes induced by alloying . in the previous subsection",
    "we have seen that the high - energy edge of the polaronic subband responds much more strongly to alloying than the bottom of the subband . from the perspective of the delocalization time",
    "this is now clear , because the high - energy edge contains `` sluggish '' defect - like states , whose large delocalization times make them feel the randomness of the on - site potential particularly strongly .",
    "the delocalization times are also modified due to alloying .",

    "the polaron parameters are the same as before ( see table [ table ] ) . in the previous subsection",

    "the delocalization times are now enhanced in two narrow energy regions : at the high - energy edge of the a mini - subband and at the high - energy edge of the b mini - subband .",
    "note , as in the case without disorder , the enhancement of the delocalization times is due to the band flattening effect , i.e. , it is driven by strong on - site electron - phonon correlations . even with the assistance of electron - impurity scattering , the on - site correlations are however not strong enough to produce divergent delocalization times .",
    "the numerical results for the delocalization times suggest that we may tentatively distinguish two types of states : `` fast '' _ quasi - partice - like _ states and `` sluggish '' _ defect - like _ states . in the ordered holstein model ,",
    "defect - like states appear at the high - energy edge of the polaronic subband .",
    "whereas in the holstein alloy , defect - like states occur at the high - energy edges of the two mini - subbands . with and without disorder ,",
    "strong on - site electron - phonon correlations are responsible for the formation of defect - like states . because the delocalization times of the defect - like states are _ several orders _ of magnitude larger than the delocalization times of the quasi - particle - like states , it is moreover conceivable that the sluggishness of the defect - like states may anticipate the onset of trapping .",
    "we have provided a self - contained description of the dcpa and employed it to investigate the dynamics of a single electron in the holstein model augmented by site - diagonal , binary - alloy type disorder ( holstein alloy ) . using multiple - scattering theory , the conventional cpa technique , we derived the dcpa equations for the averaged two- and four - point functions and emphasized the main approximation involved : namely , after each hop from one lattice site to another the electron s spatial memory is erased .",
    "we visualized the lack of spatial memory in terms of self - avoiding paths and employed this picture to give an intuitive explanation why the dcpa becomes exact for a system with infinite coordination number .",
    "our numerical results focused on the intermediate electron - phonon coupling regime , where polaronic subbands start to emerge .",
    "we investigated , for representative parameter sets , the effect of alloying on the high - energy edge of the lowest polaronic subband .",
    "these states are very susceptible to impurity scattering because of their large phonon admixture , which leads to a flat dispersion in this part of the spectrum , and , as a consequence , to a steeple - like density of states .",
    "the observed modifications of the spectral properties are therefore reminiscent of typical cpa results obtained for a model with a steeple - like density of states : a lack of @xmath185 symmetry , an appearance of mini - subbands in the vicinity of the steeple ( i.e. , high - energy edge ) of the subband for scattering strengths much smaller than the subband width , and an asymmetry in the component density of states .",
    "the most notable result is , however , the large enhancement of the spectrally resolved return probability @xmath34 for small but finite @xmath35 in the narrow energy regions where the dispersion of the polaron states becomes extremely flat .",
    "this occurs in the absence ( presence ) of alloy - type disorder at the high - energy edge(s ) of the polaronic subband ( mini - subbands ) . to elucidate the physical meaning of this strong enhancement",

    "the strong enhancement of @xmath34 in the flat part(s ) of the subband ( mini - subbands ) signals large delocalization times . according to their delocalization times we could thus classify , within the limitations of the dcpa , `` fast '' quasi - particle - like polaron states at the bottom and `` sluggish '' defect - like polaron states at the top of the subband ( mini - subbands ) .    within the dcpa , we could not decide , however , whether `` defect - like '' , i.e. , temporarily trapped states are in fact `` defect '' , i.e. , trapped states . at this point",
    "it is important to recall that within the dcpa only on - site processes contribute to the delocalization times .",
    "in contrast , inter - site processes are completely neglected .",
    "particularly , back - scattering processes are expected to have a significant effect . in the conventional alloy problem , for example , these processes even yield , depending on the model parameters , infinite delocalization times at certain energies .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that the dcpa results for the delocalization times of polaron states presented in this paper are only lower bounds and temporarily trapped states may in fact be trapped states .",
    "more sophisticated methods beyond the dcpa , taking back - scattering and other non - mean field effects explicitly into account , are clearly needed to further elucidate the trapping issue .",
