    "a strategy relies on price time series in the past in order to forecast price variations in near future and update accordingly its positions .",
    "although the market complexity , variability and stochasticity damn such forecasting to fail in nearly half cases , even a tiny excess of successful forecasts is enhanced by a very large number of trades into statistically relevant profits .",
    "many trading strategies attempt to detect an eventual trend in price series , i.e. , a sequence of positively auto - correlated price variations which may be caused , e.g. , by a news release or common activity of multiple traders . from a practical point of view",
    ", a strategy transforms the known past information into a signal for buying or selling a number of shares . from a mathematical point of view , systematic trading can be seen as a transformation of price time series into profit - and - loss ( p&l ) time series of the strategy , as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : dj_price ] . for instance , the passive ( long ) strategy of buying and holding a stock corresponds to the identity transformation .",
    "the choice for the optimal strategy depends on the imposed risk - reward criteria .    in this paper",
    ", we study the transformation of price variations into p&ls of a trend following strategy based on an exponential moving average ( ema ) .",
    "this archetypical strategy turns out to be the basis for many systematic trading platforms @xcite , while other methods such as the detrending moving average analysis or higher - order moving averages can also be employed @xcite .",
    "a trend following strategy is known to skew the probability distribution of p&ls @xcite , as we illustrate on fig .",
    "[ fig : dj_quantiles ] .",
    "this figure shows how empirically computed quantiles of price variations are transformed into quantiles of p&ls for the dow jones index ( 1900 - 2012 ) .",
    "even for such a long sample with 30733 daily returns , accurate estimation of quantiles remains problematic .",
    "moreover , the basic mechanisms of this transformation remain poorly understood . for these reasons , we will study a simple model in which standardized logarithmic returns are gaussian random variables @xcite whose auto - correlations reflect random trends .",
    "even though heavy tailed asymptotic distribution of returns and some other stylized facts are ignored @xcite , the gaussian hypothesis will allow us to derive analytical results that can be later confronted to empirical market data .",
    "we will compute the probability distribution of p&ls of a trend following strategy in order to understand how the gaussian distribution of price variations is transformed by systematic trading .",
