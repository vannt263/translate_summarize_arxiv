    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) provides a wealth of new data on isolated , rotation - powered pulsars , increasing the number of detected @xmath0-ray pulsars from seven to more than sixty ( e.g. , abdo et al .",
    "2010a ; abdo et al .",
    "2010b ; saz parkinson et al .",
    "the astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ( _ agile _ ) has also reported the detection of about twenty @xmath0-ray pulsars ( e.g. , pellizzoni et al .",
    "2009 ; pilia et al .",
    "since interpreting @xmath0-rays is less ambiguous compared with reprocessed , non - thermal x - rays , the @xmath0-ray pulsations observed from these objects are particularly important as a direct signature of basic non - thermal processes in pulsar magnetospheres , and should help to discriminate among different emission models . in this letter , we thus focus on the spectral evolution of the pulsed @xmath0-rays and examine if the hardening of the trailing peak in the light curve , a general property derived from these observations , can be explained in the context of the outer - magnetospheric emission scenario .",
    "the light curves and spectral evidence obtained by the observations mentioned above , suggest that the @xmath0-ray pulsars have high - altitude emission zones whose fan - like beams scan over a large fraction of the celestial sphere .",
    "therefore , recent pulsar high - energy emission models adopt higher - altitude emission geometries .",
    "there are three main scenarios in this approach : the outer - gap ( og ) model ( cheng et al .",
    "1986a , b ; romani  1996 ; cheng et al .  2000 ; hirotani  2006b , 2008 ; takata et al .  2008 ; romani & watters  2010 ) , the higher - altitude slot - gap model ( muslimov & harding  2004 ) , and the pair - starved polar - cap model ( frackowiak & rudak  2005 ; harding et al .  2005 ; venter et al .  2009 ) .    in the present letter ,",
    "we focus on the og model , in which pairs are created in the outer magnetosphere mainly by photon - photon ( @xmath0-@xmath0 ) pair production .",
    "the produced pairs polarize owing to the magnetic - field - aligned electric field , @xmath1 . if the rotation and magnetic axes reside in the same hemisphere , a positive @xmath1 is exerted to accelerate @xmath2 s ( or @xmath3 s ) outward ( or inwards ) , increasing the real charge density outwards .",
    "the inward - migrating , relativistic @xmath3 s radiate curvature @xmath0-rays , some of which ( nearly head - on ) collide with the x - rays emitted from the ns surface to materialize as pairs .    in a pulsar magnetosphere",
    ", there is a surface called the null surface , on which the goldreich - julian charge density ( goldreich & julian  1969 ) @xmath4 changes sign , where @xmath5 denotes the local magnetic field , @xmath6 the ns angular - velocity vector , and @xmath7 the speed of light .",
    "there is another characteristic surface called the light cylinder beyond which the co - rotational velocity exceeds @xmath7 .",
    "the distance of the light cylinder from the rotation axis is called the light - cylinder radius , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the ns rotational angular frequency . on each magnetic azimuthal angle @xmath10 ( measured around the magnetic axis counter - clockwise ) ,",
    "there is a magnetic field line that crosses the light cylinder tangentially ; they are called the the last - open field lines. an og is essentially located between the null surface and the light cylinder in the higher colatitudes ( i.e. , in the closer region to the magnetic axis ) than the last - open field lines .",
    "the characteristic energy of curvature emission is given by ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath11 where @xmath0 refers to the lorentz factor of the electron or positron , @xmath12 the planck constant divided by @xmath13 , and @xmath14 the curvature radius of particle s three - dimensional ( 3-d ) motion . in the gap , the @xmath15 s achieve electrostatic force balance , @xmath16 , and saturate at the terminal lorentz factor , @xmath17 where @xmath18 designates the charge on the positron , and @xmath1 the electric field component projected along the magnetic field line .",
    "combining equations  ( [ eq : ec ] ) and ( [ eq : term ] ) , we obtain @xmath19    since @xmath15 s are saturated at @xmath0 , the spectral density of their curvature emission declines sharply as @xmath20 above the cutoff energy , @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , for the same @xmath1 , equation  ( [ eq : ec2 ] ) shows that the curvature spectrum has a greater @xmath22 for a greater @xmath14 .",
    "since the pair production mainly takes place between the inward @xmath0-rays and the surface x - rays , most of the pairs are produced in the lower altitudes where the x - ray density is large and the collisions take place mostly head - on . thus ,",
    "outward - moving species ( e.g. , @xmath2 s ) run longer distances than inward ones within the gap , leading to a stronger outward @xmath0-ray flux than the inward one .",
    "therefore , to elucidate the physical mechanism that produces harder spectrum in the trailing peak of a @xmath0-ray light curve , we concentrate on the outward - moving particles and the resultant outward emissions in   [ sec : ecutoff ]    to reveal the nature of curvature radiation , we must consider the curvature radius of actual particle motion in the 3-d pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "well inside the light cylinder , the drift motion due to magnetic curvature , magnetic gradient , or time - varying electric field is small compared to the @xmath23 drift .",
    "thus , particles co - rotate with the magnetic field lines . in the flaring field line geometry of a ns magnetosphere ,",
    "the path of outward - moving particles can be illustrated as figure  [ fig : rc ] . in the leading side ,",
    "particle s path is bent towards the rotational direction as the thin solid curve indicates .",
    "however , in the trailing side , the path is straighter as indicated by the thick solid curve .",
    "thus , outward - moving particles have greater curvature radii in the trailing side than in the leading side .",
    "this leads to a greater @xmath22 in equation  ( [ eq : ec2 ] ) .",
    "this is the qualitative reason why most of the @xmath0-ray pulsars detected with lat exhibits harder spectrum in the trailing light - curve peak than in the leading peak .     ]",
    "next , let us examine the distribution of the curvature radius more quantitatively . due to strong relativistic beaming , curvature photons are emitted along the instantaneous particle velocity measured by the distant static observer ( i.e. , us ) . in the polar",
    "coordinates , the orthonormal components of the particle velocity become ( mestel et al .",
    "1985 ; camenzind 1986a , b ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is assumed and @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 denotes the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath29 the distance from the rotation axis .",
    "both ( @xmath30,@xmath31,@xmath32 ) and ( @xmath33,@xmath34,@xmath35 ) are measured by a distant static observer ( i.e. , in the inertial observers frame ) .",
    "the upper sign of @xmath36 ( eq .  [ [ eq : v3df ] ] ) corresponds to the outward motion along the magnetic field line , whereas the lower sign to the inward motion .",
    "these expressions are quite general and valid irrespective of the force balance on the particles as long as @xmath25 , because they are derived only from the maxwell equations and the frozen - in condition , the latter of which is justified since we consider @xmath37 ( or equivalently , consider that the potential drop in the gap is much small compared to the electro - motive force exerted on the spinning ns surface ) .",
    "for example , they are valid not only for @xmath15 s being accelerated without dissipation but also for those in the force balance between radiation - reaction and electro - static acceleration .",
    "note that equations  ( [ eq : v3d ] ) and ( [ eq : v3df ] ) correspond to a generalization of   4.1 of dyks et al .",
    "( 2010 ) into the higher altitudes .",
    "note also that equations  ( [ eq : v3d ] ) and ( [ eq : v3df ] ) are applicable not only within the light cylinder but also outside of it and that @xmath38 holds in ordinary situations .    integrating equation  ( [ eq : v3d ] ) along particle motion",
    ", we obtain the path of the particle , which allows us to compute @xmath14 as a function of the distance @xmath39 along the field line .",
    "since the incorporation of a field - line deformation due to magnetospheric currents is out of the scope of this letter , we adopt a retarded , vacuum dipole field ( cheng et al .",
    "2000 ) as an example . in figure",
    "[ fig : rc2 ] , we present @xmath40 as a function of @xmath39 for a representative magnetic field line in the leading side ( ls ; @xmath41 ) and that in the trailing side ( ts ; @xmath42 ) , where @xmath10 refers to the magnetic azimuthal angle measured around the magnetic axis counter - clockwise . the magnetic inclination angle , @xmath43 , is assumed to be @xmath44 .     as a function of the distance along the magnetic field line .",
    "both the abscissa and the ordinate are normalized by the light cylinder radius , @xmath45 .",
    "the ( red ) thick solid curve ( labeled as p - ts ) denotes @xmath40 of the actual particle path in the ts ( specifically , at @xmath42 ) .",
    "the ( red ) thick dashed curve ( p - ls ) denotes @xmath40 of the actual particle path in the ls ( @xmath46 ) . the ( black ) thin solid curve ( b - ts ) does @xmath40 of the last - open magnetic field line in the ts ( @xmath42 ) , while the ( black ) thin dashed curve ( b - ls ) that of the last - open magnetic field line in the ls ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "[ fig : rc2 ] ]    in figure  [ fig : rc2 ] , the ( red ) thick solid and dashed curves denote @xmath40 of the actual particle path , whereas the ( black ) thin solid and dashed curves do @xmath40 of the last - open magnetic field lines .",
    "the ls quantities are plotted with dashed curves , while the ts quantities with solid curves .",
    "it follows that @xmath40 of the particle path ( labeled with p - ts ) becomes greater than that of the field line ( b - ts ) in the ts . in the ls , on the contrary , @xmath40 of the particle path ( p - ls ) becomes less than that of the field line ( b - ls ) .",
    "note that b - ts is corrected to p - ts and b - ls to p - ls , and that the magnetic field lines ( see b - ls vs. b - ts ) have greater @xmath14 in the ls whereas the particle paths ( p - ls vs. p - ts ) have greater @xmath14 in the ts . in previous pulsar emission models , it has been phenomenologically assumed that the particles emit curvature radiation along local magnetic field lines and adopted b - ls and b - ts as @xmath40 ; thus , it has been impossible to reproduce a harder spectrum in the ts than the ls .",
    "precisely speaking , they did considered the aberration of photon momentum to compute the emission direction from each point ( and to reproduce the observed pulse profiles ) , but have computed @xmath14 from the magnetic field geometry ( as represented by the thin lines labeled with b - ls and b - ts ) .",
    "instead , we should take account of particles motion with equation  ( [ eq : v3d ] ) and adopt the correct @xmath14 ( as represented by p - ls and p - ts ) ; then , we obtain a harder spectrum in the ts as observed from most of the @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "to precisely compute the phase - resolved spectrum , we must solve @xmath1 and the distribution functions of @xmath15 s at each point in the 3-d pulsar magnetosphere , together with the radiative transfer . in this section",
    ", we thus solve the set of maxwell and boltzmann equations in the 3-d pulsar magnetosphere in the open zone from the ns surface to the light cylinder under appropriate boundary conditions ( see hirotani  2006a , b for details ) . to demonstrate general spectral properties",
    ", we consider typical young ns parameters , @xmath47  s , @xmath48 , @xmath49  ev , where @xmath50 refers to the blackbody temperature of the whole ns thermal emission .",
    "for this example pulsar , we adopt @xmath51 .",
    "we present the distribution of the gap in the magnetosphere by showing the gap fractional thickness , @xmath52 , projected on the last - open field line surface in figure  [ fig : hm ] .",
    "if @xmath53 , it means that all the open fluxes threads the og . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath54 , only the fluxes very close to the last - open field lines are active .",
    "it follows that the gap exist mainly outside the null surface ( white curve ) ; thus , the present solution coincidentally corresponds to a quantitative extension of previous , phenomenological og models .",
    "we next present the distribution of photon emission as a function of ns rotational phase and the observers viewing angle @xmath55 in figure  [ fig : map ] , where the distance is assumed to be 1  kpc .",
    "since only the photons emitted from the og connected to the north magnetic pole are plotted , photons propagating into the southern hemisphere ( @xmath56 ) are mostly emitted by outward - moving charges , whereas photons into @xmath57 are by inward ones .",
    "thus , we find that the outward photon flux dominates the inward one",
    ".    we can find the pulse profiles by slicing across the photon intensity plot in figure  [ fig : map ] at a constant @xmath55 .",
    "as an example , we choose @xmath58 and show the pulse profile in figure  [ fig : spc ] as the dashed line ( in arbitrary unit ) ; p1 corresponds to the leading peak , while p2 the trailing peak .",
    "one full ns rotation period is depicted in the abscissa .",
    "finally and most importantly , we examine the evolution of spectral properties with phase . to this aim , we fit the solved differential photon flux ( @xmath59 ) with a power law with exponential cutoff shape given by @xmath60 in each phase bin with @xmath61 ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) interval , where both @xmath63 and @xmath22 are in gev unit and refer to the photon energy and the cutoff energy , respectively ; @xmath64 is the photon index .",
    "the best fit @xmath64 and @xmath22 are depicted in figure  [ fig : spc ] .",
    "the ( red ) thick solid curve in the top panel denotes the evolution of @xmath64 with phase , while that in the bottom panel that of @xmath22 . for comparison , @xmath64 and @xmath22 that would be obtained",
    "if we adopted @xmath65 of the magnetic field lines ( instead of that of the particle path ) are also depicted by thin dotted curves .",
    "it follows that the photon index remains roughly constant during the bright phase , while the cutoff energy sharply peaks in the trailing peak as expected from the analytic argument in   [ sec : ecutoff ] .",
    "note that only comparable @xmath22 would be obtained in the two light - curve peaks if we adopted @xmath65 of the magnetic field lines ( as in previous pulsar emission models ) .",
    "the conclusion of greater @xmath22 in the trailing peak is , in deed , consistent with the spectral properties of most of the @xmath0-ray pulsars detected with lat ( for psr  j2021 + 3651 , see abdo et al .",

    "by examining the actual paths of outward - moving charged particles in a 3-d pulsar magnetosphere , we demonstrated that the curvature radii of their paths become larger in the trailing side ( ts ) than in the leading side ( ls ) in   [ sec : ecutoff ] . applying this result to the curvature radiation formula (   [ sec : intro ] ) , we first gave a physical explanation why the trailing peak generally exhibits a harder spectrum than the leading peak in @xmath0-ray light curves . to confirm this analytical prediction",
    ", we solved the set of maxwell and boltzmann equations in the 3-d pulsar magnetosphere in   [ sec : og ] , finding that the obtained emissivity distribution does result in a greater cutoff energy in the trailing peak than in the leading peak .",
    "although the discussion in    [ sec : og ] is limited to the og model , the same argument can be , in fact , readily applied to other higher - altitude emission models , as long as the emission is due to the curvature process .",
    "what we have to change is to amend @xmath1 ( instead of what is obtained in the og model ) as a function of position in the 3-d pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "unless @xmath1 becomes substantially greater in the ls than in the ts , the same conclusion will be derived , which is , in deed , expected both in the slot - gap and in the pair - starved polar - cap models .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spc ] , @xmath64 peaks at pulsar phase @xmath71 . however , this peaking structure of @xmath64 appears at small - flux phase , and hence is vulnerable to the choice of @xmath55 .",
    "for example , it disappears for @xmath72 . on the contrary , the peaking structure of @xmath22 at a slightly later phase of the trailing peak ,",
    "is generally obtained in a wide parameter range of ( @xmath73,@xmath74,@xmath50,@xmath43 ) and @xmath55 .",
    "although not all the parameter space has not been investigated , the conclusion that the trailing peak has a greater cutoff energy than in other phases , appears to be universal .    in this letter , we have adopted a retarded , vacuum dipole magnetic field . however , in general , we should take account of the deformation of the field lines due to the magnetospheric current ( contopoulos et al .",
    "1999 ; gruzinov 2005 ; spitkovsky 2006 ; bai & spitkovsky 2010a , b ; contopoulos & kalapotharakos 2010 ) .",
    "the effect of deformation works to straighten the field lines in the outer magnetospheres , pushing the og position towards the light cylinder particularly in the ts ; for example , if @xmath51 , the og within the region @xmath75 is suggested to be less active due to the position shift towards the light cylinder . nevertheless , the self - consistent og solution presented in   [ sec : og ] shows that the pair production is not , any way , self - sustained in @xmath75 , resulting in a negligible emission from this region .",
    "for example , the trailing peak ( around @xmath76 in pulsar phase ) is mostly formed by the emission from @xmath77 . in addition , the specific intensity towards @xmath78 direction will not be strongly affected by the straightening , which follows from panel ( d ) of figure  8 in bai and spitkovsky ( 2010b ) . on these grounds , we consider that the conclusions in the present letter are relatively less vulnerable to the correction of the field - line geometry due to magnetospheric currents .",
    "we can further apply the present numerical method to any rotation - powered pulsars . in subsequent papers",
    ", we will demonstrate that the numerical solutions are consistent with various observations of individual pulsars , such as the energy fluxes , pulse profiles , and phase - resolved spectra . to this aim",
    ", it is essential to self - consistently solve the screening processes due to the polarization of the produced pairs , together with the distribution functions of @xmath15 s and photons .",
    "this can be achieved only by solving the maxwell and boltzmann equations simultaneously in the 3-d pulsar magnetosphere .",
