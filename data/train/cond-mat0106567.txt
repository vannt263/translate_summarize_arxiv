    "consider a brownian particle , starting from the origin , whose position @xmath5 satisfies the langevin equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is gaussian white noise , such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , newman considered the following question : what is the distribution of the length of time spent by the particle to the right of a boundary moving with constant velocity @xmath0 ?",
    "this quantity , denoted by @xmath10 , is known as the occupation time of the half - line located to the right of the boundary .",
    "it reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the heaviside function .",
    "the indicator random variable @xmath13 is therefore equal to @xmath14 if @xmath15 , and @xmath16 else .",
    "similarly , the occupation time to the left of the moving boundary is denoted by @xmath17 , and such that @xmath18 .",
    "a number of past studies as well as more recent ones have been devoted to the statistics of the occupation time of stochastic processes , either in probability theory  @xcite , or in statistical physics  @xcite in the context of persistence .",
    "a derivation of the probability density of @xmath10 , @xmath19 , is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the result @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the complementary error function .    in particular , in the case of a static boundary",
    "( @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 hence the fraction of time @xmath25 spent by the brownian particle to the right of the origin admits a limiting distribution as @xmath26 , which reads @xmath27 the arcsine law  @xcite is thus recovered .",
    "the aim of this note is to complement newman s work in two directions .",
    "firstly , we give an alternative , simpler derivation of equations  ( [ ft > ] ) ,  ( [ fpm ] ) , using a method originally due to kac  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we discuss the corresponding problem for a sum of random variables , i.e. , for a random walk in discrete time , with an arbitrary distribution of steps , either narrow or broad .",
    "the general set of results due to sparre andersen  @xcite is the starting point of this analysis .",
    "a factorisation property of the distribution of the occupation time similar to  ( [ ft > ] ) holds , the role of @xmath28 being played by the quantity @xmath29 , which is simply the survival probability of the walk in the presence of the boundary .",
    "we investigate two examples in more detail . for the binomial random walk , for which a detailed study of @xmath29 can be found in  @xcite , we analyse the corrections to the continuum limit on the example of the mean occupation time ; for a cauchy distribution of steps , we determine the probability distribution of the occupation time .",
    "the problem of a particle executing symmetric brownian motion in the presence of a boundary moving with constant velocity @xmath0 is equivalent to that of biased brownian motion with velocity @xmath30 in the presence of a fixed boundary , located at the origin .",
    "consider the probability for this biased brownian walk to be at position @xmath31 at time  @xmath32 , and to have spent a length of time equal to @xmath33 to the right of the origin .",
    "the joint probability density of the event  ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "we then have @xmath37 the method of kac consists in writing a master equation for @xmath36 .",
    "it is an easy matter to realize that the latter reads , in the present case , @xmath38 with initial condition @xmath39 . in laplace space , setting @xmath40 equation  ( [ jmas ] ) yields @xmath41 this inhomogeneous differential equation is easily solved . by requiring @xmath42 to vanish at infinity ( @xmath43 )",
    ", we have @xmath44 \\hfill&(x\\ge0),\\hfill\\cr \\exp{\\left[\\left(-v+\\sqrt{v^{2}+4ds}\\right){\\displaystyle{\\displaystylex\\over\\displaystyle2d}}\\right]}^{{\\vphantom{\\displaystyle{m}}}}\\hfill&(x\\le0).\\hfill } \\right.\\ ] ] the amplitude @xmath45 is determined by the right side of  ( [ jmaslap ] ) , yielding the condition @xmath46 hence @xmath47 finally equation  ( [ jint ] ) yields @xmath48 with @xmath49 these functions are precisely the laplace transforms with respect to @xmath33 of @xmath50 given in equation  ( [ fpm ] ) .",
    "an inverse laplace transformation finally leads to the result  ( [ ft > ] ) .",
    "let us now comment on the form of the solution  ( [ ft > ] ) . a first comment concerns symmetry .",
    "it is clear that , for a given velocity @xmath0 , @xmath51 has the same distribution as @xmath52 .",
    "therefore @xmath53 this requirement is satisfied by the solution  ( [ ft > ] ) , since @xmath54 , according to  ( [ fpm ] ) , or equivalently @xmath55 , according to  ( [ flaplace ] ) .",
    "a second comment is on normalisation .",
    "integrating equation  ( [ ft > ] ) upon @xmath56 $ ] yields @xmath57 the star in the right side denoting a convolution product .",
    "hence in laplace space the equality @xmath58 should hold .",
    "this is indeed the case , as can be seen from  ( [ flaplace ] ) .    for @xmath59",
    ", the distribution of the occupation time is given by  ( [ static ] ) .",
    "the first correction to this behaviour for small @xmath0 is given by @xmath60 as a consequence , @xmath61 showing that the presence of any bias @xmath62 is relevant in the long - time regime .",
    "there is actually a non - trivial limiting distribution for @xmath63 as @xmath64 if @xmath65 ( and , by symmetry , for @xmath66 if @xmath67 ) .",
    "we have indeed @xmath68 , so that , by  ( [ ft > ] ) , @xmath69 with the notation @xmath70 . using the asymptotic expansion @xmath71 we see that the distribution  ( [ jlim ] ) falls off exponentially for large @xmath33 , as @xmath72 so that all the moments @xmath73 are finite .",
    "the latter can be computed by noting that @xmath74 which , expanded around @xmath75 , leads to @xmath76",
    "consider a discrete random walk defined by a sum of independent , identically distributed random variables : @xmath77 with an arbitrary distribution of the steps @xmath78 ( either discrete or continuous , narrow or broad ) .",
    "for this random walk , the occupation time to the right of the boundary moving with velocity @xmath0 is defined as @xmath79 hence the indicator random variable @xmath80 if @xmath81 , or @xmath16 else .",
    "the occupation time @xmath82 to the left of the boundary is defined likewise , and such that @xmath83 . as above , we note the equivalence of the problem thus stated with that of the occupation time of a random walk with biased steps @xmath84 in the presence of a fixed boundary , located at the origin .    for sums of independent random variables ,",
    "a result due to sparre andersen  @xcite expresses the probability distribution of @xmath85 as the product @xmath86 in this equation , @xmath87 , hereafter denoted by @xmath88 , is the probability that the walk remained to the right of the boundary up to time @xmath89 , or @xmath90 similarly , @xmath91 is the probability that the random walker remained to the left of the boundary up to time @xmath89 . in other words , the quantities @xmath92 are survival probabilities of the walk in the presence of the boundary , up to time",
    "@xmath89  @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath93    the generating function of the @xmath94 is related to the generating function of the one - time probabilities @xmath95 by  @xcite @xmath96 equation  ( [ spar1 ] ) is the discrete counterpart of equation  ( [ ft > ] ) .",
    "together with  ( [ spar2 ] ) , it provides the answer to the question posed ( in terms of the one - time quantities @xmath97 ) .",
    "we now illustrate the above formalism by two examples .",
    "first , for a narrow distribution of steps @xmath78 , we determine the continuum limit of equations  ( [ spar1 ] ) ,  ( [ spar2 ] ) , thus recovering the results  ( [ ft > ] ) ,  ( [ fpm ] ) obtained for brownian motion .",
    "for the binomial random walk , we investigate the corrections to the continuum limit on the example of the mean occupation time .",
    "then , for a cauchy distribution of steps , we determine the distribution of the occupation time @xmath98 explicitly .",
    "consider a narrow distribution of steps , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the continuum limit is defined as @xmath101 , @xmath102 , with @xmath103 fixed .",
    "the central limit theorem yields @xmath104    let us analyse equation  ( [ spar2 ] ) in the same limit .",
    "setting @xmath105 , to leading order as @xmath106 , identifying generating series with laplace transforms , we obtain the following estimates : @xmath107 hence finally @xmath108 with the identification @xmath109 , the result  ( [ flaplace ] ) is recovered .    for the binomial random walk ,",
    "the survival probability @xmath94 is a highly non - trivial function of the velocity @xmath0 , depending on whether @xmath0 is rational or irrational , because of the underlying lattice structure  @xcite . in particular , the limit survival probability @xmath110 , which is non - zero for @xmath67 , is discontinuous at any rational value of @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding discontinuities are algebraic numbers which can be determined explicitly  @xcite . in the continuum limit ( @xmath111 )",
    ", @xmath112 is simply given by @xmath113 .    in order to better understand the nature of the corrections to the continuum limit , we consider the simple case of the asymptotic mean occupation time @xmath114 . for the symmetric binomial random walk , and for fixed @xmath65",
    ", we have @xmath115 with @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the integer part of @xmath31 , i.e. , the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath31 .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the behaviour of this expression as @xmath118 is given by @xmath119 with @xmath120 the first term in  ( [ jzeta ] ) corresponds to the continuum - limit result ( see equation  ( [ moment ] ) ) @xmath121 because @xmath122 for the binomial random walk .",
    "the second term in  ( [ jzeta ] ) is surprising in several respects : it is of relative order @xmath123 , instead of the naturally expected @xmath124 , and the corresponding amplitude @xmath125 is transcendental .",
    "figure  1 shows a plot of the difference between the exact value of @xmath114 , obtained by evaluating numerically  ( [ jbin ] ) , and its continuum - limit expression  ( [ jtasrw ] ) .",
    "the sum of the last two terms in  ( [ jzeta ] ) , shown as a thick line , correctly describes the mean asymptotic behaviour of the plotted quantity .",
    "superimposed periodic oscillations , with period two , are also clearly visible . similar oscillations , due to the lattice underlying the discrete walk , are also encountered when considering other quantities  @xcite ( see especially figures  14 and  15 therein ) .     for the symmetric binomial random walk , and its continuum - limit expression  ( [ jtasrw ] ) , against @xmath126 .",
    "thick line : sum of last two terms of equation  ( [ jzeta ] ) .",
    "]    consider finally the case where the steps have a cauchy distribution @xmath127 because of the stability of the cauchy law , the probability @xmath128 is independent of @xmath129 : @xmath130 hereafter we denote this expression by @xmath131 , for short . using  ( [ spar2 ] ) , we get @xmath132 hence @xmath133 with @xmath134 the survival probability @xmath135 falls off as a power law , with a continuous family of persistence exponents @xmath136  @xcite .    from equation  ( [ spar1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath137 where the beta function is defined as @xmath138 defining the @xmath139 density as @xmath140 one can rewrite  ( [ t+0 ] ) as @xmath141    in the continuum limit where @xmath129 and @xmath89 are simultaneously large , with a fixed ratio @xmath142 , the binomial distribution inside  ( [ t+2 ] ) converges to @xmath143 , so that the limiting probability density function of @xmath144 reads @xmath145 in particular , if @xmath59 , then @xmath146 , and one recovers the arcsine law  ( [ arcsine ] ) . to conclude , let us briefly consider the case of a moving boundary whose position obeys an arbitrary power law : @xmath147  @xcite .",
    "if the steps have a narrow distribution , the continuum description can again be used in the regime of long times ( @xmath148 ) and weak bias ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "a generalisation of  ( [ jclt ] ) shows that the mean occupation time reads @xmath150 the case @xmath151 therefore demarcates between two regimes . for @xmath152 , the bias @xmath153 is irrelevant , so",
    "that @xmath154 , and the arcsine law  ( [ arcsine ] ) still holds asymptotically . to the contrary , for @xmath155 , any weak bias is relevant , so that a non - trivial limiting law for the occupation time @xmath156 is expected  ( for @xmath157 ) , generalising  ( [ jlim ] ) , with @xmath158 . in the marginal situation of a parabolic boundary @xmath159 ,",
    "there is a continuously varying persistence exponent @xmath160  @xcite , and the fraction @xmath161 admits a non - trivial limit distribution , which also continuously depends on @xmath153 .    if the steps have a symmetric broad ( lvy ) distribution , with tails falling off as @xmath162 , with @xmath163 , the above discussion on the relevance of the bias @xmath153 still applies , with the marginal situation being @xmath164 .",
    "the case of cauchy - distributed steps in the presence of a ballistic boundary @xmath165 is an interesting example of this marginal situation , where the dependence on the bias @xmath166 of the persistence exponent  ( [ tetav ] ) and of the limit distribution  ( [ arcsineg ] ) are known explicitly .",
    "in this appendix we investigate the behaviour as @xmath167 of expression  ( [ jbin ] ) of the mean occupation time @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath168 we set @xmath169 , and introduce the laplace transform @xmath170 .",
    "the above expression yields @xmath171 with @xmath172 .    introducing the contour - integral representation @xmath173 where the contour encircles the origin , and summing over @xmath89 at fixed @xmath174",
    ", we obtain @xmath175 hence , after some algebra , @xmath176 with @xmath177 .",
    "the leading series @xmath181 has to be investigated in some detail , by means of its mellin transform @xmath182 , for which we obtain a closed - form expression : @xmath183 where @xmath184 is riemann s zeta function .",
    "the behaviour of the subleading series @xmath185 can be estimated to leading order , replacing the sum over @xmath186 by an integral over @xmath187 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath188 ."
