    "the classes of galaxies known as luminous , ultraluminous and hyperluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , ulirgs and hylirgs ) , have been a major subject of focus in observational cosmology since initial , groundbreaking studies such as those of soifer et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and sanders et al .",
    "these objects , discovered in abundance by the infrared astronomical satellite ( _ iras _ ) , were found to possess an array of extreme properties , including an excessive energy output , effectively manifested as a large infrared / optical ratio ( sanders et al . 1989 ) .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the combination of a powerful uv - photon source and the presence of substantial amounts of dust are responsible for such extreme luminosities of the order of @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 ( e.g. sanders @xmath12 mirabel 1996 , genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) . determining",
    "the nature of the central energy source has been the subject of numerous subsequent studies , very often supplemented by multiwavelength data ( e.g. gregorich et al .",
    "1995 , genzel et al .",
    "1998 , rigopoulou et al . 1999 ,",
    "klaas et al .",
    "2001 , tacconi et al .",
    "2002 , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "these have revealed populations dominated by powerful starburst activity , but with a non - negligible active galactic nucleus ( agn ) contribution found to increase with bolometric luminosity ( e.g. veilleux et al .",
    "1997 , tran et al .",
    "2001 , brand et al .",
    "2006 ) .    the processes responsible for energy production and radiation transfer in the interstellar medium of such obscured systems are primarily evaluated by studying galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , sometimes replacing spectroscopic diagnostics in determining the nature of the central engine . for infrared - luminous objects",
    ", these processes are greatly influenced by the composition , temperature and distribution of interstellar dust .",
    "quantifying the infrared energy budget is , therefore , key in determining the generic properties of a galaxy and , as it is directly coupled to the central energy source , important in estimating the integrated cosmic star formation history .",
    "cases where photometric data is scarce , benefit from various methods of data extrapolation and interpolation : construction of infrared seds has been a popular approach of modelling emission from dusty systems , either directly from first principles or semi - empirically , bridging together contributions from different parts of the interstellar medium ( e.g. guiderdoni et al .",
    "1998 , calzetti et al .",
    "2000 , rowan - robinson 2000 ) .",
    "such models have enabled the examination of sources with extreme properties and pronounced infrared luminosity , either by solely considering star formation processes or including contribution from agn .",
    "in addition , establishing correlations between monochromatic flux densities or luminosities has proven extremely advantageous and has conveniently been used as a first order approximation of the infrared energy budget , as well as a diagnostic for the physical processes in galaxies , adopted extensively in evolution studies ( e.g. franceschini et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the properties of 43 infrared - luminous galaxies from one of the first deep _ spitzer _ far - ir surveys .",
    "this sub - sample is part of a population of 178 sources detected at 70@xmath1 m by the multiband imaging photometer on _ spitzer _ ( mips ) ( hereafter the 70@xmath1 m population ) , down to a limiting flux density of 4mjy at 5@xmath13 . in symeonidis",
    "et al . 2007",
    "( hereafter s07 ) , we gave a brief overview of the sources properties and derived star formation rate ( sfr ) estimates .",
    "here , we aim to gain qualitative insight into their physical properties , primarily with respect to dust , comparing them to similar objects in the local universe . for this purpose and to quantitatively characterise the sample , we fit our photometry with three starburst dust models and a set of empirical local galaxy templates .",
    "the paper is set out as follows : section 2 introduces our selection criteria for the sub - sample , including an overview of infrared colours .",
    "section 3 analyses and compares the model sed templates , associating the quality of fits to the properties of the sources .",
    "we investigate the infrared energy budget , with reference to sed characteristics such as the continuum slope and far - ir peak , in section 4 . finally , section 5 focuses on the derivation of a set of equations to calculate the total infrared luminosity in the range 81000@xmath1 m , with at least one mips band , for starburst - type sources .",
    "our conclusions and discussion are presented in section 6 . in all subsequent calculations ,",
    "we have employed the following values : @xmath14 kms@xmath15mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "our main data set is a 70@xmath1 m image of the extended groth strip ( egs ) field , taken by mips . in this @xmath60.5 deg@xmath18 field ,",
    "178 sources were recovered down to a limiting flux density of 4 mjy at 5@xmath13 .",
    "we direct the reader to davis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and s07 for a detailed description of all data sets acquired through the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) . in this section",
    ", we briefly refer to the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe 2 ( deep2 ) spectroscopic survey , the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) survey and the mips survey .",
    "70 and 90 per cent of the mips 70@xmath1 m area is also covered by the irac survey and mips 24 and 160@xmath1 m images , respectively . within the overlap areas of all 8 , 24 and 160@xmath1 m images",
    ", we recover 100 per cent of our targets , a total of 122 sources ( hereafter , the _ full sample _ ) . of these",
    ", 103 also appear in the remaining three irac bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 and 5.8@xmath1 m ) .",
    "deep2 obtained optical spectra for @xmath614,000 objects in the egs with a limiting magnitude of @xmath19 , using the deimos spectrograph on the keck telescopes ( davis et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the overlapping area ( @xmath675 per cent ) between the mips 70@xmath1 m image and the deep2 egs survey , 43 reliable ( quality factor @xmath203 ) spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath21 ) were retrieved in the range @xmath22 , with a mean of 0.57 and a median of 0.51 . for the remaining objects , some made the photometric cut but",
    "were assigned a poor quality redshift .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      for the 8160@xmath1 m region , the sk07 models provide the best matches to our sources infrared seds .",
    "the fact that the ce01 and dh02 templates in most cases severely underestimate the far - ir , leads us to two conclusions .",
    "firstly , the notion of a single radiating source is an over - simplification of a real system , which is more likely to be a complex and clumpy 3-d configuration with a varying temperature gradient .",
    "secondly , we propose that these high - z objects have higher obscuration and additional far - ir emission from a cold dust component that is not commonly seen in local lirgs / ulirgs , on which the ce01 and dh02 templates are based .",
    "such excess far - ir flux would be a direct consequence of a large emitting dust region , where dust in the immediate vicinity of young stars ( and/or an agn ) , would be responsible for greatly attenuating the radiation field and hence shielding the outer dust layers from direct uv illumination , resulting in lower equilibrium temperatures .",
    "this scenario is well - expressed by the sk07 models ; by including the treatment of hot spots around ob stars , the average dust temperature is lowered , shifting the far - ir peak to longer wavelengths , without a reduction in the mid - ir flux , which , according to their framework , is only linked to the dust density in the hot spot .",
    "in contrast , the ce01 and dh02 templates , which have been found to work well with local sources , fail in this case , because their formulation does not allow for the possibility of excess far - ir flux independent from the mid - ir .",
    "these observations are further supported by our empirical sed fits , which were included for the purpose of comparing with real local galaxy data ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the majority show considerable discrepancies , failing to reproduce the far - ir sed shape ( e.g. objects 77 , 93 , 110 , 122 ) , indicating that the greybody temperatures of 3050k are too high and that dust potentially colder than 30k is present in most systems .    in view of these results ,",
    "our subsequent calculations consider only the sk07 fits to the 8160@xmath1 m spectral region .",
    "the fact that the near - ir part of the sed is not well - represented , is not important since we are only concerned with pure dust emission in the 81000@xmath1 m range . for each object , we take into account all sk07 matches ( figures [ fig : goodsed ] and [ fig : goodsed2 ] and table 2 ) , to establish a valid error margin in cases where the 160@xmath1 m detection could either reside on the peak or form part of the rising continuum ( e.g. see objects 115 , 147 , 152 ) .",
    "with the aid of the best - matched sk07 templates , we perform k - corrections and estimate the monochromatic rest frame luminosities at 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m .",
    "in addition , by integrating the seds between 81000@xmath1 m , we arrive at an array of values for the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath2 ) for each object , the average of which is then used as a final estimate .",
    "the sources in the redshift sample are categorised into luminosity classes , following the definition in sanders @xmath12 mirabel ( 1996 ) , revealing that it consists of 12 per cent starbursts , 62 per cent lirgs and 26 per cent ulirgs . despite the uncertainties on @xmath2 being relatively large and stemming from the lack of photometry longward of 160@xmath1 m",
    ", only two objects move to a different luminosity class on account of this ( table 3 ) .",
    "conventional methods of characterising infrared galaxies include associating flux ratios between various bands to physical processes responsible for emission in the infrared ( e.g. xu et al .",
    "2001 ; egami et al . 2004 ; lutz et al . 2005 ; verma et al .",
    "in particular , the @xmath23 parameter has been applied extensively in _",
    "iras _ studies of such systems , to quantify relative agn / starburst contributions with an indicative value of @xmath23@xmath50.17 for agn - dominated sources ( e.g. de grijp et al .",
    "1985 , miley et al . 1985 , soifer et al . 1989 ) .",
    "this ` warm / cold ' terminology is based on the implication that dust heated by an agn would reach higher temperatures and hence lower the continuum slope between 25 and 60@xmath1 m ( or 24 and 70@xmath1 m in _ spitzer _ s case ) ( e.g. farrah et al .",
    "2005 ; verma et al .",
    "2005 , frayer et al .",
    "2006 ) . calculating the 25/60@xmath1 m continuum slope using the model seds",
    ", reveals that for @xmath625 per cent of our sample the classical iras warm source criterion of @xmath23@xmath50.17 applies .",
    "the majority of these objects peak at @xmath24100@xmath1 m , indicating that the flatter behaviour between 25 and 60@xmath1 m is due to a shift in infrared emission with elevated @xmath2490@xmath1 m flux and reduced 60@xmath1 m flux . furthermore , from figure [ fig : lumratios ] , it is clear that the continuum slope throughout the sed is completely independent from the total infrared luminosity .",
    "consequently , if it is true that the contribution of agn - dominated objects increases as a function of ir luminosity ( e.g. brand et al .",
    "2006 ) , then the slope of the mid - ir continuum and hence the @xmath25 ratio , fail to quantify it .",
    "in addition , because of heavy obscuration , emission from cool dust seems to be altering the mid - ir continuum slope solely due to increased far - ir emission .",
    "various authors have supported this idea ; chakrabarti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have modelled infrared seds with varied starburst / agn contributions , suggesting that the warm / cold classification of lirgs / ulirgs would be independent of the energy source , if sufficiently obscured so that all the far - ir emission comes from large grains in equilibrium .",
    "similar observations ( e.g. lutz et al .",
    "1996 , klaas et al .",
    "1997 ) have put forward the notion that elevated optical extinction can be responsible for a steep rise of the mid - ir continuum and hence can displace the ratio of the ` cold -warm ' components , resulting in an energy output mainly carried by the cold component .    to further investigate the properties of this sample ,",
    "the wavelength at which the seds turn over into the rayleigh - jean regime is estimated ( table 3 , column 8) .",
    "we find that a significant fraction of objects ( 40 - 60 per cent within 1@xmath13 ) peak at wavelengths longward of 90@xmath1 m independent of luminosity class . despite the large uncertainties ,",
    "there is clearly a strong correlation with respect to @xmath26 , not surprising , since 70 and 160@xmath1 m sample either side of the peak and their ratio is directly related to the far - ir turnover ( figure [ fig : lratiopeak ] , right panel ) .",
    "the same does not apply for the @xmath25 ratio , however , which shows no such dependence ( figure [ fig : lratiopeak ] , left panel ) .",
    "figures [ fig : lumratios ] and [ fig : lratiopeak ] display some important properties of the sample , consistent with conclusions from section 3 .",
    "generally , a simple black body spectrum displays a temperature dependence through the position of the emission peak , the continuum slope and the total luminosity .",
    "consequently , if the far - ir part of an sed were well - represented by a [ modified ] black body , for a sample of galaxies of varying dust temperatures this would manifest itself as : a ) a positive correlation between mid - ir continuum slope and total infrared luminosity ( as they both increase with temperature ) and b ) a negative correlation between mid - ir continuum slope and position of sed peak ( as the former increases and the latter decreases with temperature ) .",
    "however , if an extra cold dust component is present , as we believe the case to be for the 70@xmath1 m sample , a _",
    "single _ temperature black body is not a sufficiently accurate representation of the far - ir and these correlations would not apply .",
    "this is what is observed in figures [ fig : lumratios ] and [ fig : lratiopeak ] .",
    "determining the infrared energy budget is crucial for estimating the contribution to the infrared and submillimetre backgrounds and plays an important role in establishing a value for the infrared element of the cosmic star formation history .",
    "if the available photometric data is not sufficient and hence unable to explicitly define these contributions , a first order approximation of the infrared energy budget can be attained through equations relating the total infrared luminosity to the monochromatic luminosity in one or more bands . in this section ,",
    "we develop equations that can be used to estimate @xmath2 , using 1 or more mips bands .",
    "however , note that all have been derived using the typical form of starburst - type seds and have not been tested on power - law seds of agn - dominated sources .",
    "as the sed of an infrared - luminous galaxy has a distinct shape , its bolometric output can be approximated by summing contributions from four main sections : @xmath024@xmath1 m , 2470@xmath1 m , 70160@xmath1 m and @xmath5160@xmath1 m . in a linear plot of @xmath27 versus @xmath28 , flux shortward of 24@xmath1 m and longward of 160@xmath1 m is not as significant as the flux within that range .",
    "therefore the @xmath024@xmath1 m and @xmath5160@xmath1 m sections can be approximated by triangles of heights @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the sections within 24160@xmath1 m with trapezia of heights of @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath31 , @xmath30 .",
    "summing these contributions and empirically accounting for the systematic offset in this approximation , we derive an equation to calculate the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath2 ) in the range 8 - 1000@xmath1 m : @xmath32 the coefficients represent the width ( @xmath33 ) of the bases of the sections in units of hz , @xmath2 is in units of @xmath11 and @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath30 are the monochromatic luminosity densities ( in units of w / hz ) directly derived from the observed flux densities , without applying k - corrections .",
    "the factor ( 1+z ) adjusts the bases @xmath33 of the sed sections , as their width increases with redshift .",
    "the validity of this method is demonstrated by comparing the value of @xmath2 derived by using the equation ( y - axis ) and the average value of @xmath2 derived by integrating under the best - matched model seds ( x - axis ) ( figure [ fig : formulagood ] ) .",
    "there is very good agreement , with an r.m.s .",
    "deviation of 0.06 dex from the true @xmath2 .",
    "we also test it on a different galaxy sample , by calculating the total infrared luminosity of 21 local infrared star - forming / starburst galaxies using mips photometry from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxy survey ( sings ) ( dale at al .",
    "2005 , hereafter d05 ) and estimated distances quoted in sanders et al .",
    "we fit the dh02 models on the 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m photometry ( like in d05 ) and integrate under the 8 - 1000@xmath1 m region of the best - fit curve , comparing the result with @xmath2 from equation 1 .",
    "the agreement is very good , with an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.05 ( figure [ fig : sings ] ) , confirming that this equation is not specific to high - z lirgs / ulirgs , but also applicable to normal infrared star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "naturally , a more luminous galaxy will also display higher luminosity at the various infrared photometric bands ( e.g. elbaz et al .",
    "2002 , takeuchi et al .",
    "this would manifest itself as a strong positive correlation between @xmath2 and k - corrected rest - frame monochromatic luminosity at 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m ( figure [ fig : mono ] ) . as a result , it could be used instead of equation 1 , for estimating @xmath2 , in cases where only one photometric data point from mips is available . for each plot in figure",
    "[ fig : mono ] , we compute the least squares best fit line through the data , equations 24 :    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    all luminosities are in units of @xmath11 and @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath30 are in the rest frame .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "offsets from the best line fits are 0.18 , 0.11 , 0.23 dex for equations 2 , 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "this intrinsic dispersion most likely stems from the variation in the properties of each galaxy , the high photometric uncertainties as well as the range of models used to calculate each luminosity value ; nevertheless , they are convenient in cases where the luminosity of a galaxy is required only within an order of magnitude or class .",
    "we have examined a population of 70@xmath1 m selected sources , in the region of the extended groth strip , focusing this study on the infrared properties of 43 objects with available spectroscopic redshifts ( 0.1@xmath0z@xmath01.2 ) . in the last section",
    ", we derived a set of equations in order to estimate the total ir luminosity with at least one mips band , applicable to objects with starburst - type seds .",
    "we would like to emphasise that our selection criteria did not photometrically bias the redshift sample with respect to the full sample or predispose our study to a particular type of galaxy .",
    "as this is a flux limited survey ( see section 2 ) , the higher redshift objects are also more luminous in the infrared and display lower optical flux .",
    "this implies that the sources with no available spectroscopic redshift are also in the lirg / ulirg regime .",
    "in addition , the mips colours ( figure [ fig : mipscolours ] ) and seds ( figure [ fig : seds ] ) unanimously show that all objects are photometrically similar in the mid and far - ir and their properties diverge only in the optical and near - ir , not relevant for the work described here .    by fitting 4 libraries of sed templates on our infrared photometry",
    ", we have examined the properties of the sources and estimated the infrared energy budget , revealing 12 per cent starbursts , 62 per cent lirgs and 26 per cent ulirgs .",
    "evaluation of the fits showed that the sk07 models perform better at reproducing the far - ir sed ; their formulation adopts a two - component configuration of dust heated in the immediate locality of massive young stars and cirrus - heated dust , essentially decoupling mid and far infrared emission . as a result ,",
    "since the total infrared luminosity is not directly related to the position of the sed peak or the steepness of the mid - ir continuum slope , with the sk07 templates it is possible to represent objects with strong mid - ir emission and an additional cold component .",
    "ce01 and dh02 employ a scenario with a single radiating central source where temperature varies as a function of distance from the centre .",
    "although this has worked well with local infrared galaxies , it completely underestimates our sources 160@xmath1 m flux , with a discrepancy of at least a factor of 2 and up to 10 for extreme cases , since it does not allow for types of systems with elevated far - ir emission .",
    "our empirical local galaxy templates , also mostly underestimate the far - ir region , indicative of the fact that an average dust temperature of 30 - 50k is too high .    considering all above points",
    ", we propose that this deep 70@xmath1 m survey has probed high - z lirgs and ulirgs , which are unlike local counterparts : heavy obscuration and large amounts of cold dust potentially lower than 30k , appear as a _ far - infrared excess _",
    "component in the seds , causing a significant fraction to peak at @xmath2490@xmath1 m and steepening the continuum slope .",
    "the existence of such objects has also been put forward by other authors ; e.g. marcillac et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have suggested that some high - z infrared - luminous objects display far - ir properties divergent from those of local galaxies because of an additional cold dust component , even if the strength of mid - ir emission is the same .",
    "this has further implications : in such systems , the continuum slope can not be representative of various galaxy characteristics such as dust temperature , total infrared luminosity or the nature of the central energy source .",
    "figures [ fig : lumratios ] and [ fig : lratiopeak ] demonstrate this : the mid - ir continuum slope ( quantified by the @xmath25 ratio ) satisfies the iras warm source criterion of @xmath23 @xmath37 for sources with reduced 60@xmath1 m emission and increased @xmath3890@xmath1 m flux , as opposed to elevated 25@xmath1 m emission and it is completely dissociated from the position of the sed turnover and total infrared luminosity .",
    "as this is inconsistent with the representation of far - ir emission as a single temperature black body , it is in line with our earlier suggestion of the presence of an additional cold emissive component .",
    "it is worth noting that this 70@xmath1 m sample is one of the first far - ir - selected samples reaching such low flux - density limits and additional similar surveys will be of great importance in highlighting the differences ( if any ) between local and high redshift infrared populations .",
    "the next infrared observatory , _ herschel _ , will greatly benefit this work , extending to the sub - mm part of the spectrum and , hence , enabling a complete census of high - z infrared galaxy seds .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that in order to confirm our conclusions we have planned a follow - up of the work described in this paper with submillimetre observations using the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba 2 ) .",
    "m.s . has received support from the university of oxford , department of astrophysics .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under nasa contract 1407 .",

    "<S> we examine the infrared properties of 43 high redshift ( 0.1@xmath0z@xmath01.2 ) , infrared - luminous galaxies in the extended groth strip ( egs ) , selected by a deep 70@xmath1 m survey with the multiband imaging photometer on _ spitzer _ ( mips ) . in addition and with reference to starburst - type spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , we derive a set of equations for estimating the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath2 ) in the range 81000@xmath1 m using photometry from at least one mips band . </S>",
    "<S> 42 out of 43 of our sources optical / infrared seds ( @xmath3@xmath0160 @xmath1 m ) are starburst - type , with only one object displaying a prominent power - law near - infrared continuum . for a quantitative analysis , </S>",
    "<S> models of radiation transfer in dusty media are fit onto the infrared photometry , revealing that the majority of galaxies are represented by high extinction , a@xmath4@xmath535 and for a large fraction ( @xmath650 per cent ) the sed turns over into the rayleigh - jeans regime at wavelengths longward of 90@xmath1 m . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also fit semi - empirical templates based on _ local _ galaxy data , however , these underestimate the far - infrared sed shape by a factor of at least 2 and in extreme cases up to 10 for the majority ( @xmath670 per cent ) of the sources </S>",
    "<S> . further investigation of sed characteristics reveals that the mid - infrared ( 70/24@xmath1 m ) continuum slope is decoupled from various galaxy properties such as the total infrared luminosity and far - infrared peak , quantified by the l@xmath7/l@xmath8 ratio . in view of these results , </S>",
    "<S> we propose that these high - redshift galaxies have different properties to their local counterparts , in the sense that large amounts of dust cause heavy obscuration and are responsible for an additional cold emissive component , appearing as a _ far - infrared excess _ in their seds .    </S>",
