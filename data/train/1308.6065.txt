    "it may be noted that the nonlinearity or nonunitarity mentioned above pertains to the basic dynamical equations , and do not refer to the nonlinearity occuring in effective theories such as the gross - pitaevski equation @xcite or the euler - heisenberg lagrangian @xcite , or to the nonunitarity occuring in open quantum systems @xcite . from a foundational perspective , understanding what modifications to qm are tenable is relevant to one of the open problems in modern theoretical physics : namely , the unification of qm with general relativity for creating a unified theory of quantum gravity .",
    "this presumably involves generalizing either theory in hope of a better match with the current version of the other .",
    "one approach to studying variants of qm is via the post - quantum framework of generalized probability theories @xcite or considering the properties of correlations shared between two or more observers @xcite . in another approach due to sorkin @xcite , and actively under study @xcite , qm is placed within a hierarchy of probability measure theories , whose members can be distinguished operationally using a generalization of young s double slit experiment @xcite . in such an experiment ,",
    "one assigns a probability measure to a set of pathways belonging to a particle being detected at a given point on the screen .",
    "for example , consider the double slit experiment , with slits @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in which one or both slits may be left open . for any point on the screen ,",
    "we can write down the three quantities @xmath2 , representing the probability of detection with both slits being open , with only slit @xmath0 open and with only slit @xmath1 open , respectively . here ` @xmath3 ' is the boolean ` and ` operator . for quantum probability , the interference term :",
    "@xmath4 is non - vanishing , i.e. , the 2-sum rule @xmath5 , fails @xcite , meaning that probabilities with individual slits being open are not additive .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum mechanical born rule satisfies the 3-sum rule , in that the three - term interference @xmath6 vanishes .",
    "here @xmath7 is the probability to detect a particle at a given position , with slits @xmath8 and @xmath9 open . in qm ,",
    "suppose @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the amplitude that a particle propagates from slit @xmath12 to point @xmath13 on the screen , then we have @xmath14 , @xmath15 , etc . , and @xmath16 , etc .",
    "substituting these into eq .",
    "( [ eq:3int ] ) , we find that @xmath17 , implying that third - order ( and higher - order interference ) are absent in the hierarchy of sum - rules defined as follows . informally , this is because interference occurs through mixing of pairs of paths and not triplets or quadruplets of paths .",

    "it is of interest to know whether such modifications to qm can accomodate other properties of qm , considered to be fundamental , since if this were not so , then this incompatability could be used as an axiomatic basis @xcite to rule out higher order interference .",
    "here we prove that , under certain assumptions , such higher order super - quantum interferences indeed lead to superluminal signaling .",
    "in developing this hierarchical framework , sorkin had ignored contributions from non - classical i.e. , looped paths @xcite . in a recent work ,",
    "one of us has investigated the effect of including such paths in the calculation @xcite .",
    "we find that taking into account non - classical paths in a triple slit problem , does indeed generate a non - zero third order interference term .",
    "however , in our calculations , we still hold the born rule to be true and essentially complete the text book picture which tends to ignore non - classical paths .",
    "thus , our results @xcite do not contradict the claims of the current work , where sorkin s no - looped path assumption is adopted .",
    "another assumption is that the state space structure of quantum mechanics holds good , with only the dynamical part altered to accommodate a new interference recipe . in this context , it is of interest to note a recent work @xcite , where the authors present a formalism to realize the higher - order interferences , with states being represented by tensors of correspondingly larger number of indices . in contrast to our approach , their method allows for the possibility of non - quantum states .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate the consequence from our signaling point of view for such generalized theories .",
    "the remaining article is arranged as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "nosig ] , we briefly recall the no - signaling principle . whereas certain postquantum theories , such as those discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite are explicitly designed to be non - signaling , the status of signaling in sorkin s formalism has not been studied , as far as we know .",
    "an argument is presented in section [ sec : new ] for why a violation of no - signaling may result from deviations from the born rule under the assumption of standard properties of the state space of qm and its tensor product structure .",
    "it is not straightforward to apply this result to the sorkin formalism because the latter only specifies how quantum interference can be generalized , while remaining mute on whether or what other alterations to the theory accompany this . under the stated assumptions , a specific realization of nonlocal signaling in the sorkin formalism",
    "is considered and demonstrated in section [ sec:3more ] using a non - maximally entangled state in a sufficiently high - dimensional space .",
    "our result does not rule out modifications to qm along the lines envisaged by sorkin , but suggests regimes where such effects may be relevant .",
    "we briefly adumbrate this point and conclude in section [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "no - signaling is a fundamental feature of qm as we understand it , and implies that a signal does not travel from one point to another except through the physical communication of a particle .",
    "it is in fact a feature of non - relativistic qm , but compatible with relativity .",
    "einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlations interpreted `` realistically '' imply a nonlocal influence , demonstrated by the violation of bell - type inequalities @xcite , but this nonlocality can not be used for signaling .",
    "formally , no - signaling is the statement that the reduced density operator of a system is unaffected by local operations on another system with which it may be entangled .",
    "given the joint density operator @xmath22 of two particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and any local operation @xmath23 on particle @xmath1 ( a local unitary , a measurement or a general positive opertor valued measure ) , let @xmath24 be the joint state after the operation .",
    "we have @xmath25 since we necessarily have that @xmath26 , by completeness .",
    "the above proof of no - signaling presumes the validity of taking partial trace , which is related to the born rule , in the sense that it is the unique function of the density operator of a composite system that is compatible with the born rule and the tensor product structure @xcite . the implications for signaling of relaxing this rule are now considered .",

    "these ensembles which are unitarily equivalent in standard qm may become inequivalent when non - bornian probabilities are allowed in an ensemble - dependent way , resulting in a signal .",

    "if yes , it would form the basis of a nonlocal signaling .",
    "however , the violation may simply cause a local redistribution of probabilities observed in the screen behind the slits , and not result in signaling . in the entanglement - based scheme considered in section [ sec : b2a ] , a similar conspiracy by local redistribution can thwart a signal when @xmath1 , rather than @xmath0 , determines the realized ensemble .",

    "alice s is a spin-@xmath62 particle , which ensures that its measurement statistics are unaffected even if there is a deviation from born rule due to the presence of higher order interference terms in the sorkin framework .",
    "we may begin by considering ( maximal ) entanglement between the modes of bob s particle , that are assumed to be localized at each slit , and corresponding modes of alice s particle .",
