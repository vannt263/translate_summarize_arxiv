    "experiments in which a bose condensed cloud of ultra - cold atoms is divided into two spatially separated components and then allowed to recombine have been widely reported @xcite .",
    "these experiments are of fundamental interest , for example , in demonstrating the quantum nature of the condensate and in investigating decoherence . in addition ,",
    "such processes are central to matter wave interferometry using ultra - cold atom condensates , which may have many technological applications .",
    "in general , there are two ways in which initially separated clouds can be made to evolve so that they subsequently overlap .",
    "firstly , they can be allowed to expand by relaxing the confining potential that holds them apart @xcite .",
    "secondly , they can be subjected to external potential gradients that cause the clouds to move together and collide whilst maintaining their form @xcite . in realistic scenarios ,",
    "a merging process will , to some extent , involve both of these mechanisms",
    ". the resulting interference pattern will be more complex than in either of the idealized cases , particularly for systems in which inter - atomic interactions are involved .",
    "there has been some theoretical work on freely expanding condensate clouds in which inter - atomic interactions are shown to increase the expansion rate @xcite and create nonuniform interference fringes @xcite .",
    "however , to date there has been little study of this general case or how it compares with either the purely expanding or purely colliding scenarios , in particular , the dynamics of curved fringes in the merging becs .",
    "it is now known that , while the behavior of very low density condensates can be well described using elementary single - particle quantum mechanics , systems in which the interactions are stronger show behavior which is quantitatively , and frequently qualitatively , different . in particular",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the interference pattern formed when two counterpropagating interacting clouds overlap can give rise to the formation of persistent dark solitary waves and , subsequently , the nucleation of linear arrays of vortex rings . as well as having implications for real matter wave interferometers , these processes are of intrinsic interest as an experimentally controllable route to homogeneous quantum turbulence @xcite .",
    "recently , experiments have observed the spontaneous formation of vortices in a ring trap in which the condensate is split into three components and then allowed to recombine @xcite .",
    "related theoretical work focuses on the role of ramping down the trap potential and phase imprinting on the formation of these spontaneous vortices @xcite .",
    "although the role of interference in the formation of vortices has been pointed out @xcite , the detailed description of how the interference affects the formation of nonlinear excitations has not been shown .    in this paper , we model experiments in which a bose - condensed cloud is divided adiabatically into two components , for example by using a tailored magnetic potential from an atom chip @xcite , the introduction of an optical barrier via a shaped blue - detuned laser @xcite or by passing counterpropagating red detuned laser beams through an acousto - optic modulator driven at rf frequencies @xcite .",
    "we examine how the process of both expansion and collision affects the interference patterns of two becs by varying the initial peak densities of the clouds and their relative center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "collision velocities ( controlled by varying the accelerating potential in which they move ) .",
    "our numerical simulations , based on the mean field gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , show that in regimes where the interactions are significant , interference fringes first develop non - uniform spacings and then become curved . in extreme cases ,",
    "the curvature can become sufficient for there to be a net circulation around a localized core region leading to the formation of a vortex ring .",
    "interactions are important at higher densities but at lower collision velocities . at higher",
    "collisional velocities the system can not respond hydrodynamically to the high - density fringes before the clouds have passed through one another and the fringes have disappeared . through the analysis of a set of simulations and known experiments , we argue that a connection between vortex formation and interference in merging becs exists . specifically , the interference of the condensates generates high - density peaks and extremely low - density valleys .",
    "the combined effects of inter - atomic repulsion and the non - uniform density profile of the condensates produce the additional degrees of freedom in the area of interference , with the result that the high - density areas from the interference peaks encircle the low - density areas between them .",
    "our general protocol involves preparing each of a pair of clouds in the lowest ( mean field ) energy state of a harmonic trap .",
    "the prepared clouds are then displaced in opposite directions and allowed to evolve when subject to a harmonic trap potential , which need not be the same as that used to prepare the initial clouds . in general",
    ", two dynamical processes will occur before the two clouds overlap .",
    "firstly the clouds can undergo ( ballistic ) c.m .",
    "motion in response to the trap potential .",
    "secondly the clouds can change shape as they evolve ( most notably expanding or contracting ) .",
    "in general , of course , both processes will occur but we can identify two extreme limits .",
    "if two copies of a non - interacting bose gas are prepared in the lowest energy state of a given harmonic trap and are then placed at symmetrical points away from the center of that trap , the clouds will move ballistically without changing volume until they overlap spatially .",
    "we refer to this as a `` colliding process '' .",
    "alternatively , two ( interacting ) clouds prepared as above can be initially held a fixed distance apart and then allowed to evolve after switching off the trap potential . in this case",
    ", the clouds will expand until they overlap .",
    "we refer to such a process as an `` expanding '' process .",
    "intermediate cases where neither ballistic c.m .",
    "motion nor expansion dominate will be referred to as `` merging '' processes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the system of interest is a series of condensate fringes with similar shapes but different densities .",

    "fig.[chap3_fig7 ] shows that our simulations are in basic agreement with analytic prediction that a higher density leads to a larger expansion rate .",

    "this curved fringe pattern is similar to that observed in experiment @xcite where condensates with short separation tend to form large variations in density in the merging region .",

    "when the two clouds recollide at time @xmath130 , both are recollapsing radially leading to an enhanced density in the bright fringes causing an even greater longitudinal expansion and greater density gradients in the radial direction ( f ) .",
    "the curvature of the fringes is thus even greater than in the first collision , ( g ) , and is sufficient to generate a net circulation around localized regions that are fully depleted : vortices are generated , as seen in ( h ) .",

    "this is exhibited by a loss of homogeneity in the fringe spacing and , in turn , fringe curvature .",
    "the upwards curve of the boundary between expanding and merging behavior is similar to that for the boundary between colliding and merging behavior shown in ( fig.[chap3_fig4 ] ( b ) ) .",

    "if the velocity is too low then damping of the motion during the first overlap effectively arrests the dynamics .",
    "in addition , the low velocity leads to a large fringe spacing so that , even towards the edges of the cloud , the curvature is never sufficient to cause a net circulation .",
    "if the collision velocity is too high , the hydrodynamic response of the cloud is too slow and the clouds have separated before any significant distortion occurs @xcite ( inserted plot in fig.[chap3_fig4 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "our simulations show that the curvature of the interference fringes is of importance in the formation of vortices and that the number of fringes within the cloud determine the number of vortices .",
    "this is shown in the inserted plots of fig.([chap3_fig4 ] ) ( c ) where the five fringes from the short initial separation result in the formation of two vortex rings while the nine fringes from the large initial separation cause six vortex rings .",
    "the connection between the distortion of fringes and the formation of vortices can explain the experiments in which more vortices are generated in the faster merging , interfering region @xcite .",
    "the faster merging produces more interference fringes , creating the possibility for the formation of more vortices in the region .",
    "the diagram in fig.([chap3_fig4 ] ) is based on the specific material parameters described in the previous sections .",
    "simulations using different parameters give results that are similar but with the cross - over lines shifted . in general , for the smaller values of the coupling constant , @xmath106 , and with the larger numbers of atoms , it is easier to observe the crossover from colliding process to merging process .",
    "finally , we address the effect of the halo of scattered atoms , produced by the counter - propagating condensates , on the interference pattern .",
    "the phenomena that two becs collide at a sufficiently high velocity , a halo of elastically scattered atoms is produced , have been demonstrated by both experiments @xcite and theory @xcite . in the expanding and merging processes of our system",
    ", the scattered atoms might not have significant effect on the interference patterns because the rapid decrease of the densities corresponding to the fast expansion of the clouds would reduce the rate of atom - atom collision in merging areas .",
    "for the colliding process , the visibility of the interference can be reduced and the fringes can be distorted due to the scattered atoms . however , these effects can be suppressed or avoided if the density and velocity of clouds are low , or the colliding process is controlled by properly adjusting the barriers @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have investigated vortex formation and interference instability of two merging condensates and identified three distinct regimes in situations relevant to atom interferometry .",
    "our simulations show an explanation about recent experimental work @xcite , where the faster merging three becs creates more vortices .",
    "the regularity of vortex formation and interference might allow for the design of experiments to study vortex creation and the dynamics of regular , linear , vortex arrays .",
    "our latest calculations show clearly that one could control the density of vortices generated by tuning the fringe spacing .",

    "<S> we investigate the distortion of interference fringes in colliding and merging bose - einstein condensates due to inter - atomic interaction effects . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the effect of the distortion on the spontaneous formation of vortices . </S>",
    "<S> the interference pattern depends crucially on two relevant parameters , the relative center - of - mass velocity and peak density of the initial state , which comprises a pair of initially well - separated , but coherent , condensate clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we identify three qualitatively distinct regimes of behavior during the subsequent evolution of the condensates : collision ; expansion ; merging . using a comprehensive set of numerical simulations based on the gross - pitaevskii equation , </S>",
    "<S> we specify the cross - overs between these regimes and identify the system parameters required for dynamical instabilities and vortex creation . interference fringes , which would be planar in the absence of interactions , are distorted by the combined effects of interaction and the non - uniform density profile of a harmonically trapped condensate . in appropriate parameter regimes , the distortion is sufficiently large to produce a net circulation and thereby a dynamical instability occurs by which vortices form with their cores on the interference minima . </S>"
