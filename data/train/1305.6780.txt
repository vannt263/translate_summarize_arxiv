    "weyl semimetal is a new topological state of three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum matters  @xcite , different from the 3d topological insulators ( ti )  @xcite .",
    "it can be characterized by weyl nodes ( at fermi level ) in the bulk and fermi arcs on the surfaces  @xcite . around the weyl nodes ,",
    "the low energy physics is given as 3d two - component weyl fermions  @xcite , @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is pauli matrix and @xmath4 is crystal moment ) , which carries chirality , left- or right - handed defined by the sign of velocity @xmath5 .",
    "weyl nodes are stable topological objects as long as @xmath4 is well defined , and can be viewed as effective magnetic monopoles in the 3d momentum space  @xcite . to get weyl semimetal , either time - reversal ( tr ) or inversion symmetry needs to be broken  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , there will be double degeneracy for all @xmath4 . in the case with both tr and inversion symmetries ,",
    "however , we may expect a 3d dirac semimetal state described as four - component dirac fermions , @xmath6 , which can be viewed as two copies of distinct weyl fermions .",
    "unfortunately , this expectation is generally not true , because two weyl nodes with opposite chirality may annihilate each other if they overlap in momentum space , and open up a gap in general .",
    "therefore , additional symmetry is required to protect the 3d dirac semimetal  @xcite state and to prohibit the possible mass term , unless it is at the phase boundary between ti and normal insulators  @xcite , a subtle situation hard to be controlled .",
    "the symmetry protected 3d dirac semimetal has been discussed  @xcite for systems with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , focusing on special @xmath4 points with four - dimensional - irreducible - representation ( fdir )  @xcite , which usually appears at the brillouin zone ( bz ) boundary with non - symmorphic double space groups . in general , this fdir requirement is too strong , and we may expect much wider compound choices by considering two doubly - degenerate bands with distinct 2d representations and unavoidable band crossing ( protected by crystalline symmetry ) . in such case , we may get 3d dirac points along the high - symmetry lines rather than high symmetry points at the bz boundary .",
    "this scenario of dirac semimetal has been suggested in our earlier studies on na@xmath0bi  @xcite , which is unfortunately not stable in air . in this paper , we show that a well known compound cd@xmath0as@xmath1 is a symmetry - protected 3d dirac semimetal with a single pair of dirac points in the bulk and non - trivial fermi arcs on the surface .",
    "it can be driven into a topological insulator , a weyl semi - metal , or a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator with gap more than 100mev .",
    "it can also support sizable linear quantum magnetoresistance ( mr ) even up to room temperature .",
    "the nice aspect of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 is the high carrier mobility up to 1.5 m@xmath7v@xmath8s@xmath8 at room temperature and 8.0 m@xmath7v@xmath8s@xmath8 at 4 k , reported about 50 years ago  @xcite .",
    "this makes it a promising candidate for future transport studies .",
    "we will start from the structure and methods in sec .",
    "[ methodology ] , present the main results in sec .",
    "[ result ] , and finally conclude in sec .  [ conclusion ] .",
    "among the ii@xmath0-v@xmath1-types narrow gap semiconductors , cd@xmath0as@xmath1 has drawn crucial attention , because it was believed to have inverted band structure ,  @xcite whereas all others cd@xmath0p@xmath1 , zn@xmath0as@xmath1 and zn@xmath0p@xmath1 have normal band ordering . in contrast to other inverted band compounds ( like hgte , hgse , and @xmath9-sn ) , cd@xmath0as@xmath1 belongs to tetragonal symmetry , and is the representative of this group , which has the splitted valence band top at @xmath4=0 .",
    "the crystal structure of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 is complicated , and can be related to tetragonally - distorted anti - fluorite structure with 1/4 cd site vacancy . if the distribution of these vacancies is random , one may treat it by virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) for simplicity  @xcite .",
    "however , those vacancies are in fact ordered even at room temperature , leading to a tetragonal structure with @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) symmetry ( 40 atoms per unit cell , called structure i hereafter ) , or a body centered tetragonal structure with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) symmetry ( 80 atoms per unit cell , called structure ii hereafter ) , with the later structure more favored  @xcite .",
    "this vacancy ordering and very large cell of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 cause historically serious problems for theoretical studies , and there is no existing first - principles calculations up to now .",
    "we report here the first band structure calculations of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 with its true structures and with soc included .",
    "we perform the first - principles band - structure calculations within the density functional formalism as implemented in vasp  @xcite , and use the all - electron projector augmented wave ( paw )  @xcite basis sets with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite for the exchange correlation potential .",
    "the hamiltonian contains the scalar relativistic corrections , and the spin - orbit coupling is taken into account by the second variation method  @xcite .",
    "the cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion was 500 ev and a * k*-point mesh of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are used for the bulk calculations of structure i and ii , respectively .    for the convenience of our later discussions for the effective low energy physics",
    ", here we briefly introduce our modified second - order 8-band kane model  @xcite for typical semiconductors .",
    "we start from the standard 4-band second - order kane model  @xcite for the case of without soc , and then introduce additional terms to take into account the particular tetragonal symmetry of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 . in the @xmath16 approximation , considering the low energy @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 states ( as basis ) around @xmath21 , the modified 4-band kane model is given as ,    @xmath22    comparing with the strandard isotropic 4-band kane model  @xcite , here we consider the anisotropic tetragonal symmetry , and introduce the paramter @xmath23 for the crystal - field splitting of @xmath24 orbitals .",
    "the other parameter @xmath25 is introduced to describe the breaking of inversion symmetry for structure ii , and it should be zero for structure i. then our modified 8-band kane model can be obtained by adding the soc term as , @xmath26 where * i * is the @xmath27 identity matrix and @xmath28 denotes the strength of soc .",

    "the representation of selected bands at @xmath21 and along high symmetric @xmath4 path are indicated .",
    "solid dots in band structures indicate the projected @xmath29 bands . ]",
    "similar to most of the semiconductors with anti - fluorite or zinc - blende structures , the low energy electronic properties of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 are mostly determined by the cd-@xmath30 states ( conduction bands ) and the as-@xmath31 states ( valence bands ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ldaband ] . however , there are two distinct features : ( 1 ) band - inversion around @xmath21 point with the @xmath29-state ( red solid cycle ) lower than the @xmath32-states , which is an important sign of non - trivial topology ; ( 2 ) semi - metallic with band crossing along the @xmath21-z direction",
    ". this band - crossing is unavoidable , because the two bands belong to different ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) representations respectively , as distinguished by @xmath35 rotational symmetry around @xmath36 axis .",
    "the different representation prohibits hybridization between them , resulting in the protected band - crossing .",
    "furthermore , the crossing points should locate exactly at the fermi level due to charge neutrality requirement , resulting in a 3d dirac semimetal state with fermi surface consisting of a single pair of fermi points ( two symmetric points along @xmath36 related by tr ) .",
    "both the structure i and ii share the above common features but with one important difference : structure i has inversion center but structure ii does nt",
    ".    as had been attempted with perturbation method  @xcite , vacancy ordering and bz folding play important role for the band - inversion , in contrast to the cases of hgte or ag@xmath1te",
    "@xcite , where it was driven by the the shallow @xmath25 states . to prove this , we performed calculations for cd@xmath0as@xmath1 in hypothetic anti - fluorite structure without vacancy ( using vca ) and in cubic anti - fluorite structure with one cd vacancy , keeping the same lattice constant .",
    "we found that the former ( later ) has normal ( inverted ) band ordering at @xmath21 . at the bz boundary x point of hypothetic anti - fluorite structure without vacancy , there exist shallow @xmath29 and @xmath32 states , which are folded onto the @xmath21 point of real structure .",
    "therefore , the hybridization among the states with the same representation will push the states away from each other , i.e , make the lowest @xmath29-state further lower and highest @xmath32-state higher , resulting in the band inversion at @xmath21 .",
    "the band - inversion calculated from gga is about 0.7 ev for both structure i and ii . considering the possible underestimation of gga for the @xmath29-@xmath32 gap",
    ", we have improved the calculations by hse method  @xcite , and still found the band - inversion around 0.3 ev , being consistent with most of the existing experimental evidence , such as the optical and transport measurements  @xcite .",
    "the calculated band structures of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 can be well fitted by using our modified 8-band kane model presented in previous section , and the obtained parameters are listed in table.i .",

    "the heavy - hole @xmath32-state @xmath43 and the conduction @xmath29-state @xmath44 remain to be the eigenstates at @xmath21 , while the light - hole states @xmath41 can mix with the split - off state @xmath42 , forming two new eigenstates which are irrelevant to the low energy physics here .",
    "the band inversion nature of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 around the @xmath21 can be caught by considering only the minimal basis set of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 states . to describe the 3d dirac fermion , an effective low energy hamiltonian @xmath49",
    "can therefore be obtained by downfolding the 8-band model into the subspace spanned by the 4 mimimal basis .",

    ", the leading - order term of @xmath59 has to take the high - order form of @xmath60 , which can be neglected if we only consider the expansion up to @xmath61 .",
    "the terms containing @xmath62 describe the breaking of inversion symmetry , which should be zero for structure i. in such case , the energy dispersion is @xmath63 , having a pair of four - fold degenerate zero energy dirac points at @xmath64=(0 , 0 , @xmath65 ) .",
    "around the neighborhood of each dirac point , we can further expand the hamiltonian up to @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is nothing but the one for 3d massless dirac fermions , which has anisotropic linear dispersion @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is the deviation of momentum @xmath4 from the dirac point @xmath68 ) .",
    "the block diagonal form allows us to decouple the 4@xmath694 matrix into two 2@xmath692 matrices , which are weyl fermions with degenerate energy but opposite chirality . for structure",
    "ii , which has no inversion symmetry , the non - vanishing d term will modify the in - plane velocity from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , while keep the weyl nodes degenerate ( because the @xmath72 symmetry along the gamma - z axis contains only 2d irreducible representations for its double space group ) .",
    "the resulting dirac semimetal state has 4-fold degenerate dirac points , but with splitting of in - plane band dispersions away from dirac points ( fig .",

    "a stable weyl semimetal state with two weyl nodes separated in momentum space can be introduced either by lowering the crystal symmetry from @xmath72 to @xmath35 , or by breaking the tr symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in particular , due to the large @xmath76-factor ( around 30@xmath7740 ) of cd@xmath0as@xmath1  @xcite , an exchange - splitting of @xmath77 2mev can be introduced by moderate 1 t magnetic field ( if we neglect the orbital effects ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the 4-fold rotational symmetry is broken , a linear leading order term of @xmath78 , will be introduced in the effective hamiltonian @xmath79 . in such case",
    ", two weyl nodes will be coupled together , resulting in a massive dirac fermions with gap opening .",
    "we have checked the topological invariant @xmath80 number for this resulting insulating state , and found it is odd , confirming that it is a 3d topological insulator  @xcite ( due to the inverted band structure ) .",
    "the non - trivial topology and the 3d dirac cones in cd@xmath0as@xmath1 suggest the presence of non - trivial surface states . for this purpose",
    ", we transform the eight - band model into a tight - binding model on a tetragonal lattice by introducing the substitutions : @xmath81 here , @xmath82 refers to @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath36 , while @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the tetragonal lattice constants , which are taken as 3.0    and 5.0   , respectively .",
    "this approximation is valid in the vicinity of the @xmath21 point .",
    "we use an iterative method to obtain the surface green s function of the semi - infinite system  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the surface green s function is the local density of states ( ldos ) at the surface . since gga underestimate the @xmath29-@xmath32 band gap by about 0.4  ev as discussed above , we have artificially lifted the on - site energy of @xmath29-state ( as given in table .",

    "the existence of 3d dirac cones in the bulk also implies that we can expect the qsh effect if we reduce the dimensionality and form the quantum well structure of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 .",
    "this provides an alternative compound choice to the existing experiments  @xcite , which all require extreme conditions up to now .",
    "the band structure of @xmath89-oriented cd@xmath0as@xmath1 thin film of different thickness can be understood as the bulk bands in different @xmath90-fixed planes .",
    "the 2d z@xmath1 number can be nonzero only for limited regions where the band inversion happens when going from @xmath21 to z. in the quantum - well structure , those low energy states around @xmath21 should be further quantized into subbands , whose energy levels change as a function of film thickness ( fig .",

    ", finite size effect is getting weaker and the band inversion among these subbands restores subsequently , which leads to jumps in the z@xmath1 number .",
    "then , depending on the number of band inversions associated with the sub - bands , the system should cross over between trivial and nontrivial 2d insulators oscillatorily as a function of thickness  @xcite ( fig .  [ wellband](b ) ) .",
    "comparing with hgte / cdte quantum well  @xcite , the first critical thickness of cd@xmath0as@xmath1 is much thinner ( 2.9 nm vs. 6.3 nm ) , suggesting possibly larger gap . to be a concrete example",

    "quantum effects become noticeable when the individual landau levels are distinct : @xmath91@xmath92@xmath93 .",

    "in summary , based on the first - principles calculations and effective model analysis , we have shown that the known compound cd@xmath0as@xmath1 is a symmetry - protected topological semimetal with a pair of 3d dirac points ( located at the fermi level ) in the bulk and fermi arcs on the surfaces . it can be driven into various topologically distinct phases , such as topological insulator and weyl semimetal state by symmetry breakings .",
    "in addition , due to its unique 3d dirac cone type electronic structure , we can expect the qsh effect in its quantum well structure and the sizable linear quantum mr even up to the room temperature",
