    "it is known that extreme confinement conditions in passive systems generate strong inter - particle correlations , leading to subdiffusion  @xcite . under strong confinement as well as biases imposed by external fields or environmental conditions ,",
    "the enhanced mobility characteristic of active particles may lead to new collective dynamical properties .",
    "these , in turns , may strongly affect the the system s transport behavior , e.g. , in channel - emptying processes , or the microbiology of soil during infections or for filtration and purification applications  @xcite .",
    "although hydrodynamic effects are expected to play a role under severe geometric constraints @xcite , in favor of simplicity and analytical tractability in the present context we consider a minimal brownian model for active motion @xcite . indeed ,",
    "a major goal in this work is to study how single file properties are modified when self - propelled particles are present .",
    "we tackle this issue by investigating the interplay between the increased mobility due to activity and the hindering effects coming from the single file condition .",
    "in particular , with both open channel ends , we concentrate on the dependence of its emptying from either the degree of activity or the rotational vs translational character of the active motion .",
    "we find that the active particles undergo a dynamical transition from rotational to translational behavior , which also corresponds to a structural change for the asf system , with the formation of `` active clusters '' continuously merging and splitting .",
    "albeit not significantly improved by the existence of clusters , translational active particles expose a significant capability of trespassing channels against external biases .",

    "we quantify the particle s activity through the pclet number , namely the ratio between advection and diffusion @xcite : @xmath21 within our model , pe can also be interpreted as the ratio between the work done by the active force over a distance of the order of the particle s size and the thermal energy . at variance with ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not fix the ratio between @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
