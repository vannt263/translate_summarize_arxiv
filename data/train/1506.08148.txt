    "for example , the dimension of the affine hull of the set of flag vectors of @xmath6-polytopes , which we denote by @xmath12 , is a fibonacci number minus one @xcite , and thus grows exponentially with @xmath6 . on the other hand , within some important classes of polytopes",
    "the @xmath4-vector determines the flag vector ; for example , this holds for @xmath0-polytopes , as well as for simplicial polytopes ( and thus for simple polytopes , by duality ) .",
    "thus the results just quoted also characterize the flag vector sets @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "while the @xmath4-vectors and the flag vectors of @xmath0-polytopes are thus completely understood , for @xmath2-dimensional polytopes our knowledge about the sets of @xmath4-vectors and of flag vectors is rather incomplete .",

    "a systematic study of the @xmath2-dimensional set @xmath16 was started by bayer @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but there are still open questions , e.g.  those related to the _ fatness_. while there are @xmath0-spheres of arbitrarily large fatness , this is not known for @xmath2-polytopes @xcite . on the other hand , there is a lower bound for the fatness of @xmath2-polytopes , but we do not know whether this also holds for @xmath0-spheres  @xcite .",

    "hence , all @xmath0-spheres are polyhedral and we will simply refer to them as @xmath0-spheres .    as polyhedral spheres appear very naturally in any attempt to enumerate combinatorial types of polytopes ( see e.g.  grnbaum ( * ? ? ? * sects .",

    "up to now all available evidence with respect to the question ( [ conj : flag ] ) was positive .",
    "there are many simplicial @xmath0-spheres ( but also non - simplicial ones ) that are non - polytopal , that is , not combinatorially equivalent to the boundary complex of a @xmath2-polytope , so @xmath22 , and consequently @xmath23 for all @xmath24 . indeed , _",

    "the flag vectors of 2s2s @xmath0-spheres/@xmath2-polytopes are of the form @xmath29 and any @xmath0-sphere/@xmath2-polytope with such a flag vector is 2s2s .",

    "@xmath0-sphere @xmath34 is the only sphere with this flag vector .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : non - polytopal ] we prove that this sphere does not have an oriented matroid , so in particular it is not polytopal .",
    "we will present an alternative proof of the non - polytopality of @xmath34 in section [ sec : diagrams ] . in proposition [ prop :",
    "diagrams ] we show that the sphere does not have a diagram based on the facet @xmath36 , which implies that @xmath34 is non - polytopal . based on the non - polytopality",
    ", we show in section [ sec : embeddability ] that the sphere @xmath34 can not be realized as a polytopal complex in any  @xmath37 .",
    "we conjecture that also @xmath38 , but we have not proved that . in particular , we know of no @xmath2-polytope with the @xmath4-vector @xmath39 .",
    "as marge bayer has pointed out to us , any @xmath0-sphere with this @xmath4-vector would be `` close '' to being 2s2s , as it must satisfy @xmath40 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  2 ( 3 ) ) .",
    "we would also assume that @xmath41 holds for all @xmath42 , but again this does not seem to follow immediately from our results .",
    "the goal of this section is to report about the proof of the following result , which includes the uniqueness claim in theorem  [ thm : main ] .    [ thm:2s2s_spheres ] the following is a complete list of combinatorial types of @xmath3-simple @xmath3-simplicial @xmath0-spheres with at most @xmath35 vertices . +    [",
    "cols=\"^,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     these coordinates were found with the similar methods as we used for finding coordinates for the diagrams : from the combinatorics we constructed a partial chirotope of rank @xmath43 , and then we used scip to find coordinates satisfying this .",
    "however , with the methods from the previous section we were not able to decide whether @xmath34 is embeddable or star - shaped . for embeddability the oriented matroid approach will not work , since there are infinitely many dimensions to check . in the star - shaped case",
    "we did not find coordinates , but on the other hand we found an oriented matroid that does not have a bfp .",
    "the sphere @xmath34 is not embeddable , and hence it is not star - shaped .",
    "this proof heavily depends on the structure of @xmath34 , and establishes the following :    1 .",
    "if @xmath34 is embeddable into some @xmath44 , @xmath45 , then it is also embeddable into @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath34 is embedded into @xmath46 , then this is an embedding as convex polytope .",
    "let us assume that @xmath34 is embedded in some @xmath44 , that is , it is realized by a polytopal complex @xmath47 ( where each of the facets is realized as a convex @xmath0-polytope ) .",
    "for ( i ) we note that @xmath48 is a simple vertex , that is , a vertex that is contained in only @xmath2 facets , or equivalently , in only @xmath2 edges .",
    "the @xmath2 facets are each contained in the affine span of @xmath0 of these edges , so all @xmath2 facets are contained in the affine span of the @xmath2 edges . moreover , each of the @xmath35 vertices of the sphere are contained in at least one of the @xmath2 facets , which are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "so the complete embedded sphere is contained in this affine @xmath2-dimensional subspace of @xmath44 .    for ( ii ) note that the argument for ( i ) implies that in addition each of the facets @xmath49 and @xmath50 is also a facet of the convex hull of @xmath47 , that is , all of @xmath47 is contained in a closed halfspace of the hyperplane spanned by the facet , while only the vertices of the facet lie on the boundary hyperplane .",
    "exactly the same arguments are valid for the other three simple vertices of @xmath34 and the facets they are contained in , that is , for @xmath51 and the facets @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for @xmath54 and the facets @xmath55 and @xmath56 , as well as for @xmath57 and the facets @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus we have established for all facets @xmath60 of @xmath47 , except for the tetrahedron @xmath36 , that it is also a facet of the convex hull of @xmath47 . as mentioned above , @xmath36 is special in the way that it is the only facet that does not contain a simple vertex .    to see that also @xmath36 is a facet of the convex hull of @xmath47 ,",
    "consider its neighbours @xmath61 , @xmath50 , @xmath53 , and @xmath56 .",
    "since these are all facets of the convex hull of @xmath47 , they can not lie in the same hyperplane as @xmath36 .",
    "the facet @xmath61 gives that the vertices @xmath62 , and @xmath54 lie on the same side of the hyperplane @xmath63 spanned by @xmath36 .",
    "now , the facet @xmath50 contains @xmath48 , the facet @xmath53 contains @xmath51 , and the facet @xmath56 contains @xmath54 , whence the points from these facets not in @xmath36 are also all on the same side of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we have that all points , except possibly @xmath57 , lie in , say , @xmath64 . since @xmath59 is a bipyramid over the triangle @xmath65 with apexes @xmath57 and @xmath66 , and since @xmath66 is in @xmath36 , it follows @xmath67 .",
    "this completes the proof of ( ii ) .",
