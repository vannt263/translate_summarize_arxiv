    "neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices are excellent candidates for quantum computation because they are well isolated from environment , leading to long coherence times , and easy to use for storing and processing quantum information @xcite . in optical lattices ,",
    "controlled interactions between atoms may be implemented effectively , and highly entangled states of many atoms may be created in a single operational step @xcite . more importantly , very efficient schemes for quantum error corrections @xcite and fault - tolerant computing shor can be straightforwardly implemented because of parallel operations in optical lattices @xcite and long coherence times .",
    "an outstanding challenge for quantum computation in optical lattices is the selective manipulation and measurement of quantum states of single atoms , because spatial periods of typical optical lattices are shorter than optical resolutions ( long wavelength lattices may provide single site addressability , but it is difficult to implement mott insulating states with one atom per site necessary for quantum computation in such lattices scheun ) . single qubit operation is not only a building block of universal quantum computation @xcite , but also an essential ingredient for the recently proposed one way quantum computation , where quantum information is processed by performing single qubit rotations and measurements on entangled cluster states @xcite .",
    "experimentally , entangled cluster states have been realized for neutral atoms by using controlled cold collisions in spin - dependent optical lattices @xcite .",
    "therefore , implementations of single atom manipulation and measurement may eventually lead to universal quantum computation in optical lattices .    in this paper , we show that high fidelity selective manipulation and measurement of single atoms in optical lattices can be achieved with the assistance of focused lasers @xcite .",
    "consider a deep two dimensional optical lattice with one atom per lattice site @xcite .",
    "the logical qubit basis of each atom is formed by two hyperfine states that can be coupled coherently using microwave radiation .",
    "the couplings are same for all atoms because of the degeneracy of their hyperfine splittings . in the presence of",
    "spatially varying external fields , the degeneracy may be lifted and atoms separated by certain distance can be individually manipulated . for instance , individual atoms separated around @xmath1 have been selectively addressed in an experiment using magnetic field gradients @xcite , but such a method is not useful for atoms separated by a half - wavelength of typical optical lattices , where impractically large gradients or small fluctuations of the magnetic fields would be required .    the degeneracy of hyperfine splittings may also be lifted in the presence of focused lasers that induce position - dependent energy shifts of hyperfine states ( _ light shifts _ ) @xcite due to the spatial distributions of laser intensities . through varying intensities and detunings of the focused lasers , we may adjust the difference of hyperfine splittings between neighboring atoms to a regime where microwave radiation affects mainly target atoms , while impact on non - target atoms is strongly suppressed with properly chosen microwave pulse sequences .",
    "various errors in the manipulation process are found to be below @xmath2 except for the spontaneous emission probability of atoms in the focused laser .",
    "finally , we show that the quantum states of individual atoms in optical lattices may also be measured using position - dependent energy shifts of hyperfine states .",
    "we develop the scheme as realistically as possible , and illustrate it using @xmath3rb atoms , although the technique is applicable to other species as well .",
    "consider @xmath4rb atoms confined in a two dimensional ( @xmath5 plane ) optical lattice with wavelength @xmath6 .",
    "perpendicular to the plane , the atomic dynamics are frozen out by high frequency optical traps @xcite .",
    "the lattice is ramped up adiabatically to a potential depth @xmath7 such that the bose - einstein condensate is converted into a mott insulating state with one atom per lattice site @xcite . here",

    ", we adiabatically turn on a focused laser that propagates along @xmath13 axis having the maximal intensity located at @xmath12 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the focused laser is obtained by passing an initial large gaussian beam with waist @xmath14 through a lens with diameter @xmath15 and focal length @xmath16 , and its intensity shows an airy pattern @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wavevector of the focused laser , @xmath19 is the zero order bessel function , and @xmath20 . with properly chosen lens parameters ( see tab i ) , the initial gaussian beam is focused to the diffraction limit , where the intensity pattern is accurately described by above airy function . in contrast , commonly used gaussian beam approximation is not precise in such limit . in addition",
    ", the airy pattern has a narrower waist for the central intensity distribution , leading to a smaller focused laser intensity on neighboring atoms , although the pattern extends more broadly than a gaussian distribution that has an exponential decay .",
    "such an intensity pattern induces position - dependent energy shifts jessen@xmath21for hyperfine ground states @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the speed of light , @xmath25 is the decay rate of excited state @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the transition coefficient , @xmath28 is the frequency , and @xmath29 is the detuning of the focused laser for the transition @xmath30 .",
    "different polarizations and detunings of the focused laser yield different shifts of hyperfine splittings @xmath31 between two qubit states . here",

    "therefore the degeneracy of hyperfine splittings between different atoms is lifted ( fig.1(b ) ) . in fig.1(c ) , the optical potential @xmath45 for atoms around the focused laser is plotted .",
    "we see that the minimal potential barrier , @xmath46 , occurs for atom @xmath38 at state @xmath47 .",
    "the tunneling rate of atom @xmath38 to the neighboring site @xmath12 is @xmath48 using fermi s golden rule , where @xmath49 is the hopping matrix element and @xmath50 is the energy gap between the initial and final states . in a symmetric optical lattice",

    "i.    to avoid excitations of atoms to higher bands of optical lattices , the rising speed of the focused laser intensity should satisfy the adiabatic condition @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the energy gap , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the wavefunctions of the ground and excited states , and @xmath58 is a parameter that determines the degree of adiabaticity .",
    "because of the high potential barrier for each atom , the wavefunctions and energy gap may be obtained using the harmonic oscillator approximation , and we find @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the potential barrier for atom at position @xmath62 with state @xmath63 , and we have approximated the airy pattern of the focused laser intensity using a gaussian function with an effective beam waist @xmath64 .",

    "we focus on @xmath80 although similar results for @xmath84 may be obtained straightforwardly .    to achieve a reliable single qubit rotation with negligible impact on non - target atoms , the microwave rabi pulses need to satisfy the following criteria : ( i ) the variations of the occupation probabilities of state @xmath85 of non - target atoms are extremely small ( below @xmath86 ) ; ( ii ) the relative phase @xmath76 between two qubit states must return to the initial value after the microwave pulses . in the following ,",
    "we show how a single qubit rotation on the target atom @xmath12 satisfying these criteria is achieved by using gaussian shaped rotation pulses together with refocusing pulses .",

    ", the fourier transformation @xmath89 of the rabi frequency @xmath90 of this type of pulse shows a gaussian shaped decay with respect to the detuning @xmath91 from the microwave frequency . because of their large detuning @xmath91 , non - target atoms undergo rabi oscillations with small frequencies @xmath92 , which strongly suppress the variations of their occupation probabilities .",

    "( [ rabieq ] ) , which yields@xmath106here @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this expression is in very good agreement with the numerical results presented in fig .",
    "2 .    in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the single qubit manipulation errors for the nearest neighboring atom @xmath38 with respect to @xmath103 .",
    "the errors are smaller than @xmath2 for different rabi pulse areas and different initial states .",
    "we have also performed numerical simulations for many other initial states , finding that errors below @xmath2 are always achieved .",
    "the manipulation errors are even smaller for all other atoms because they have larger detuning @xmath110 .",
    "the relative phase @xmath76 is harder to control than the occupation probability because it can not only vary from @xmath111 to @xmath112 many times with large frequency @xmath110 during the rabi pulses , but also be easily affected by interactions with the environment that lead to dephasing . to eliminate the variation of @xmath76",
    ", we use the following pulse sequence that is similar to the refocusing process in nmr studies nielsen . to realize an area @xmath113 pulse , we adiabatically ramp up the focused laser , apply a @xmath114 pulse on the target atom @xmath12 ( it induces a rotation around @xmath82 axis ) using the gaussian shaped pulse described above , then adiabatically ramp down the focused laser in step ( i ) . in this step , atoms obtain phase variations @xmath115 determined by their detunings @xmath110 and the dephasing process . in step ( ii ) , we apply a fast resonant @xmath116 pulse to all atoms that corresponds to an angle @xmath116 rotation around @xmath117 axis .",
    "this pulse is called the refocusing pulse . in step ( iii )",
    "we repeat step ( i ) , and in step ( iv ) we apply another @xmath116 refocusing pulse .",
    "the two refocusing pulses do not affect the pulse area for target atoms because the combination of them corresponds to a @xmath112 rotation around @xmath117 axis .",
    "however , the effective directions of the rotations around @xmath118 axis for all atoms in step ( iii ) are reversed from that in step ( i ) by two refocusing pulses , therefore the phase variation in step ( iii ) becomes @xmath119 .",
    "these two phase variations cancel each other and the relative phase @xmath76 returns to its initial value after the pulse sequence .      in an experiment , a difficult parameter to specify",
    "is the spatial distribution of the focused laser intensity that determines the detuning @xmath120 , the central parameter of the scheme .",
    "however , our scheme only requires a large @xmath110 , not any specific value , therefore this is not a significant difficulty .",
    "another important issue in the experiment is the misalignment of the focused laser from the minimum of the optical lattice potential .",
    "a small displacement @xmath121 of the focused laser induces a detuning of the microwave scaling as @xmath122 from the hyperfine splitting between two qubit states of the target atom , and thus reduces the fidelity of the single qubit rotation . for @xmath123",
    ", we estimate the detuning to be @xmath124 and the fidelity of the single qubit rotation is degraded by @xmath125 .",
    "generally , errors due to small mis - detuning of the microwave may be corrected using composite pulses technology developed in  the nmr quantum computation @xcite .    in the single qubit manipulation ,",
    "the probability of spontaneous scattering one photon for atoms in the focused laser is estimated to be @xmath126 , which is the worst parameter in the scheme .",
    "this parameter is limited by the need for a maximal ratio between the vector light shifts and the spontaneous scattering rate , which does not allow arbitrarily large detunings .",
    "the energy shift induced by the focused laser is around several hundreds @xmath127 , which is much smaller than the decay rate @xmath128 of excited states and can not be used to selectively measure quantum states of target atoms . to obtain large energy shifts , we transfer the target atom to other magnetic sublevels ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) using several @xmath116 microwave pulses with the assistance of focused lasers . then a focused @xmath131-polarized laser resonant with the transition @xmath132 @xmath133 is applied to detect atoms at state @xmath134 . in this process",
    ", resonant fluorescence is observed if and only if the initial state of the target atom is @xmath22 and the probability to detect an atom yields @xmath135 of the target atom .",
    "the detection laser can be focused on the target atoms as well as the focused laser beam using for single atom manipulation because they both use @xmath33 transition . in the experiment",
    ", a constant @xmath136 magnetic field along @xmath137-axis may be used to induce about @xmath138 zeeman splitting between states @xmath34 and @xmath139 , while @xmath140 between @xmath141 and @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "therefore the detection laser is about @xmath143 detuned from the transition @xmath144 @xmath145 , which yields a maximal ratio @xmath146 @xcite between the photons scattering on non - target and target atoms , that is , @xmath147 photons have been scattered on the target atoms to induce one photon scattering on the neighboring non - target atoms . the impact on non - target atoms in the detection process",
    "may therefore be neglected .",
    "we emphasize that such high fidelity single atom manipulation can not be accomplished using magnetic field gradients . to obtain the same detuning @xmath120 as that using focused lasers , an impractical magnetic field gradient  ( @xmath148t / cm ) is required . while in a typical gradient @xmath149g / cm , a single atom rotation takes about @xmath150ms ( much longer than the cold collision time ( @xmath151 ) for many - qubit gates jaksch , mandel1 ) , and requires unattainably small magnetic field fluctuations ( @xmath152 g ) .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field gradient method can only be used to selectively address atoms along one dimension , while the focused laser scheme can select two dimensions .",
    "we notice that single qubit rotations may also be performed using two - photon raman transitions @xcite with the assistance of focused lasers . in this case , the beam waists of the raman pulses need to be relatively large ( @xmath153 ) so that small misalignments of the lasers do not cause large changes of the laser intensities on the target atoms that may diminish the fidelity of single qubit rotations . because two - photon raman transitions only affect atoms inside the rabi pulses , atoms separated by a long distance may be addressed simultaneously with different pulse sequences , which may reduce the total computation time .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed a scheme for manipulating and measuring quantum states of single atoms in optical lattices with the assistance of focused lasers .",
    "with properly chosen experimental parameters , various manipulation errors are suppressed below @xmath2 except the spontaneous emission probability of atoms in focused lasers .",
    "our proposal includes a realistic and practical quantitative analysis suggesting plausible experimental implementation of single atom manipulation in optical lattice quantum computation architecture .",
    "the technique also has broad applications for investigating various interesting physics in optical lattices such as engineering and probing many - body quantum states in strongly - correlated systems , topological quantum computation , etc .",
