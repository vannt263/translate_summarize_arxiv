    "since its discovery , the kondo problem is one of the central topics in condensed - matter physics.@xcite it describes a magnetic spin-@xmath4 impurity embedded into a metal and may be the simplest example for the growth of an effective coupling at low energies , resulting in a nonperturbative ground state . for normal metals this ground state",
    "is found to be of fermi - liquid type , where the quasi - particle wave functions simply acquire a phase shift.@xcite the situation might change in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems which are known to exhibit non - fermi liquid behavior for arbitrary coulomb interactions .",
    "the fundamental theory of interacting 1d metals in the low - energy regime is the luttinger liquid model.@xcite it is therefore of interest to understand the kondo effect in a luttinger liquid .",
    "an additional motivation arises from recent advances in nanofabrication which now allow for controlled experiments on 1d systems.@xcite in the future the question of how magnetic impurities behave when coupled to 1d metals might be of crucial importance for experiments on quantum wires,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite or for edge states in the fractional quantum hall regime.@xcite    the luttinger liquid model unifies the low - temperature physics of many microscopic lattice models for strongly correlated fermions , with only very few phenomenological parameters . in particular , one has the dimensionless coulomb interaction strength parameters @xmath2 and @xmath5 for charge and spin sectors , respectively , and the charge- and spin - density velocities @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the crucial assumptions are the absence of lattice instabilities ( like umklapp scattering ) , the absence of electron - electron backscattering , and that the coulomb interaction potential is screened by mobile charge carriers close to the 1d metal . as a simple model for interacting fermions ,",
    "the luttinger liquid model is widely used to study the influence of electronic correlations on dynamical properties of 1d metals , in particular in the presence of impurities .",
    "the case of a spinless impurity is by now well understood.@xcite if the impurity has internal degrees of freedom , the situation is more complicated and subject of this paper .",
    "a kondo impurity coupled to a luttinger liquid was first considered by lee und toner.@xcite employing the perturbative renormalization group they established how the kondo temperature @xmath8 depends on the exchange coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "this turns out to be a power - law dependence , while for normal metals @xmath8 is an exponential function of the coupling constant.@xcite the same power law was found by furusaki and nagaosa.@xcite these authors derived the correct @xmath10 invariant scaling equations in the weak - coupling regime and tentatively extended them to the strong - coupling regime , where a stable strong - coupling fixed point was found for both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange couplings .",
    "this strong - coupling fixed point describes a many - body singlet formed by the impurity spin and the conduction electrons , similar to what happens in a normal metal .",
    "moreover , furusaki and nagaosa made detailed predictions concerning the low - temperature critical properties of the impurity , e.g. , the magnetic susceptibility , the heat capacity , and the conductance .",
    "these quantities were found to exhibit power - law behavior with interaction - dependent exponents .    however , it remained unclear whether the extrapolation of the perturbative scaling equations into the strong - coupling regime is justified .",
    "recent boundary conformal field theory ( cft ) results by frjdh and johannesson@xcite allow only two possible scenarios .",
    "either the system belongs to the fermi liquid universality class or it indeed has the properties predicted by furusaki and nagaosa .",
    "cft itself is however unable to unambiguously decide which universality class is ultimately realized for the kondo problem in a luttinger liquid .",
    "several recent papers seem to favor the local fermi - liquid picture .",
    "schiller and ingersent have discussed a truncated but related model which exhibits fermi - liquid behavior.@xcite in addition , according to the numerical density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculation of wang,@xcite fermi - liquid behavior holds for a spin-@xmath4 impurity interacting with a 1d hubbard chain .",
    "recently , chen _ et al . _",
    "deduced fermi - liquid laws from the parity and spin - rotation symmetry of a related model.@xcite here we shall address and resolve this controversial issue .",
    "so far few studies have dealt with magnetic impurities exhibiting elastic potential scattering in addition to the conventional ( kondo ) exchange coupling.@xcite why it should be considered at all becomes clear after the following discussion .",
    "if one starts out from the usual anderson model to describe a localized orbital interacting with conduction electrons , the natural generalization in 1d would include coulomb interactions among the conduction electrons.@xcite for uncorrelated conduction electrons , one can then derive the usual kondo exchange coupling in the local moment regime [ which is realized for large on - site repulsion and a single - particle impurity level deep below the fermi energy ] by applying the schrieffer - wolff transformation.@xcite this transformation generates the exchange coupling [ see eq .",
    "( [ contact ] ) below ] and , in addition , an elastic potential scattering term . in the correlated case of interest here",
    ", this latter term may be crucial since elastic potential scattering is relevant in a luttinger liquid.@xcite what can happen to a magnetic impurity in a luttinger liquid in the presence of strong potential scattering was first studied by fabrizio and gogolin.@xcite they predict that at the strong - coupling point for the kondo effect discussed above elastic potential scattering is irrelevant for rather weak repulsive coulomb interaction , namely for @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast , for strong enough interaction , @xmath3 , the potential scattering breaks up the system into two independent chains .",
    "the magnetic impurity then interacts with two subsystems ( channels ) , and the two - channel kondo picture emerges.@xcite    in this paper we present a path - integral quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method allowing for the computation of thermodynamic properties of a kondo impurity in a luttinger liquid .",
    "this method is numerically exact within the statistical error bars inherent to the mc technique .",
    "the main advantages of our method are the absence of any system - size restriction , contrary to dmrg simulations or several qmc lattice algorithms,@xcite and the possibility of treating arbitrarily correlated conduction electrons . however , as is well known , qmc simulations of spin systems often have to deal with the fundamental sign problem.@xcite it is caused by sign alternations of the qmc weight function for different system configurations .",
    "this generally leads to a small signal - to - noise ratio and hence to numerical instabilities .",
    "the approach we shall discuss here is also plagued by a sign problem .",
    "however , our sampling technique moderates the problem to an extent allowing us to treat sufficiently low temperatures.@xcite moreover , we have also applied filtering techniques@xcite which provide a general method to ease the mentioned difficulties . yet the approach described below suffers only from a minor intrinsic sign problem , and the use of the filtering technique is not really crucial to obtain the results described below .",
    "finally we mention that for a calculation of the kondo screening cloud around the impurity , a simpler version of the present simulation method has been employed by egger and schoeller.@xcite    one might ask why we chose to develop a new algorithm for studying the kondo effect even though the exceptionally stable and widely used qmc impurity algorithm due to hirsch and fye @xcite is available . the reason is that we have to include the coulomb interactions among the conduction electrons which are responsible for the luttinger liquid state . in the hirsch - fye algorithm ,",
    "one traces out the conduction electron degrees of freedom away from the impurity and then updates only the arising fermion determinant .",
    "however , by construction , this procedure works only if the conduction electrons are in the fermi liquid state . by employing the bosonization method , as is shown below , one can in fact follow a similar route as in ref . and trace out the now correlated conduction electrons away from the impurity . from a historical point of view",
    ", it may perhaps seem surprising that the qmc technique has not been a major tool in the resolution of the conventional kondo problem where conduction electrons are described by a fermi liquid . as realized in ref . , the main obstacle is the exponentially small kondo temperature , which in turn requires the study of extremely low temperatures difficult to achieve in path - integral mc calculations . for the kondo effect in a luttinger liquid ,",
    "however , the kondo temperature is much higher and qmc simulations become feasible even in the asymptotic low - temperature regime .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the luttinger liquid model with a kondo impurity and describe our monte carlo algorithm in some detail . in sec .",
    "iii results for a kondo impurity in the absence of elastic potential scattering are presented , and sec .",
    "iv gives results in the presence of additional strong elastic potential scattering .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are offered in sec .  v.",
    "the low - energy properties of correlated 1d systems are most conveniently described in terms of the bosonization method.@xcite the spin-@xmath4 electron field operator is expressed in terms of spin and charge boson fields which obey the algebra ( we put @xmath12 ) @xmath13 = -\\frac{i}{2}\\delta_{ij } { \\rm sgn}(x - x')\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denote the charge ( _ c _ ) or spin ( _ s _ ) degrees of freedom .",

    "the fermi liquid behavior will always dominate . however , at sufficiently low temperatures , the furusaki - nagaosa exponents can be observed at @xmath11 .",
    "this finding is in conflict with the recent numerical dmrg study by wang,@xcite which reports fermi - liquid behavior for a spin-@xmath4 impurity coupled to a hubbard chain .",
    "notice that the interaction parameter @xmath2 for the 1d hubbard model away from half - filling is always within the bounds @xmath11.@xcite most likely the discrepancy is caused by finite - size effects due to the short chain lengths used in ref .  .",
    "the more complicated outcome ( [ sug ] ) also shows that the simplified model by schiller and ingersent@xcite does not capture all essentials of the kondo effect in a luttinger liquid .",
    "finally , let us discuss our data for extremely strong interactions , @xmath170 .",
    "for the clean case , it is well established that the luttinger liquid model for @xmath182 is equivalent to the low - energy sector of the 1d heisenberg spin chain.@xcite assuming that this reasoning carries over if a magnetic impurity is present , the @xmath162 scaling of the impurity susceptibility observed here ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] for @xmath171 ) should also describe the susceptibility of a spin-@xmath4 impurity interacting with a 1d heisenberg chain .",
    "one has to be careful to couple the impurity to just one site of the heisenberg chain , otherwise an additional potential scattering contribution will be present ( see refs . and sec .",
    "a different result was reported very recently by liu,@xcite namely a @xmath183 scaling of the impurity susceptibility at low temperatures .",
    "unfortunately , the reason for this discrepancy is not clear at the moment .",
    "in this section the influence of elastic potential scattering on the critical properties of a spin-@xmath4 impurity in a luttinger liquid will be discussed . as already mentioned in the introduction , for sufficiently strong interaction strength , @xmath3 , and for strong enough potential scattering ,",
    "the system is expected to display physics familiar from the two - channel kondo model.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , data are shown for @xmath148 . at high temperatures , with or without elastic potential scattering ,",
    "the curie susceptibility of a free spin is always approached , @xmath184 however , while the impurity susceptibility displays a crossover to the finite value @xmath185 at zero temperature for vanishing elastic potential scattering strength ( @xmath186 ) , the behavior is drastically different if potential scattering is present ( here , @xmath187 ) . the impurity susceptibility does not saturate but continues to increase without bound when lowering the temperature . since we have semi - logarithmic scales in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , our data are accurately fitted by the susceptibility of the two - channel kondo model,@xcite @xmath188 where @xmath189 . this value for @xmath190",
    "( see ref . )",
    "is indeed obtained from the slope of the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the corresponding results for @xmath168 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . the logarithmically divergent behavior in the presence of potential scattering",
    "is not found anymore , and the low - temperature impurity susceptibility saturates at a finite value @xmath191 . since @xmath192 , we expect from eq .",
    "( [ tk2 ] ) that all effects of potential scattering can be incorporated by a renormalization of the kondo temperature @xmath8 to smaller values . within statistical error bars , the data for @xmath193 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] can indeed be scaled onto the @xmath186 data , and the scaling function @xmath149 holds even in the presence of elastic potential scattering .",
    "clearly , this finding is in sharp contrast to the case of strong interactions , @xmath148 , where potential scattering drastically changes the temperature dependence of the impurity susceptibility .    from these data and the arguments of ref . , we then expect two - channel kondo behavior and hence a logarithmically divergent susceptibility for all @xmath3",
    ". an important special case of this general result is recovered for @xmath182 which corresponds to the 1d heisenberg chain . using numerical methods , bosonization and cft techniques , eggert and affleck@xcite and clarke _ et al._@xcite",
    "have shown that a spin-@xmath4 impurity in a heisenberg chain exhibits a logarithmically divergent impurity susceptibility . due to the specific coupling of the impurity to the 1d spin chain in these studies , an additional elastic potential scattering was present besides the usual kondo exchange coupling term .",
    "in this paper the critical behavior of a spin-@xmath4 impurity in a correlated one - dimensional metal ( luttinger liquid ) has been investigated numerically . to circumvent finite - size restrictions ,",
    "we have developed and applied a quantum monte carlo algorithm which allows to determine any finite - temperature equilibrium quantity of interest .",
    "here we have focused on the impurity susceptibility @xmath112 with particular emphasis on the low - temperature behavior well below the kondo temperature .",
    "let us briefly summarize the main findings emerging from our numerically exact analysis .",
    "if elastic potential scattering is ignored , the impurity susceptibility shows the scaling behavior @xmath194 with a distinct universal scaling function @xmath149 for each dimensionless interaction strength @xmath2",
    ". it may be worth mentioning that scaling holds even outside the asymptotic low - temperature regime @xmath195 . within error bars ,",
    "all data can be scaled onto universal scaling functions as long as @xmath196 , where @xmath20 is the bandwidth . matching @xmath147 curves for different @xmath9 ( but at a given @xmath2 ) onto a scaling curve also yields the correct power - law dependence of the kondo temperature , @xmath197 , which was first given in ref ..    we have then used our algorithm to determine the critical behavior for @xmath195 .",
    "generally one finds power laws @xmath198 with some exponent @xmath199 . at @xmath148 and @xmath161 , we find @xmath200 , but at @xmath168 , a different exponent @xmath201 is obtained .",
    "our data are consistent with the simultaneous existence of two leading irrelevant operators , one describing fermi - liquid behavior ( @xmath200 ) , the other describing the furusaki - nagaosa@xcite anomalous exponent @xmath202 . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the fermi - liquid behavior is dominant , but at @xmath11 , one can indeed observe the @xmath2-dependent exponents .",
    "these findings resolve the recent controversy@xcite about the low - temperature criticality of the kondo effect in a luttinger liquid .",
    "we have also studied the effects of elastic potential scattering using our numerical approach . as predicted by fabrizio and gogolin,@xcite for sufficiently strong coulomb interaction strength , @xmath3 ,",
    "the impurity susceptibility exhibits a logarithmically divergent behavior .",
    "the @xmath203 scaling is a manifestation of two - channel kondo physics caused by the effectively open boundary at the impurity site .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath11 , the susceptibility saturates to a finite value at zero temperature and potential scattering does not modify the critical behavior .    to conclude , we have numerically examined the critical scaling properties of the kondo effect in a luttinger liquid .",
    "an interesting question which has not yet been studied in detail is related to universality in the presence of potential scattering , e.g. , the existence of universal scaling functions for the impurity susceptibility .",
    "future applications of our monte carlo algorithm might also deal with the case of more than one impurity , or with a systematic study of other quantities like the impurity specific heat .",
