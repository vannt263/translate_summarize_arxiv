    "pairing correlations and pair - transfer reactions are intimately related as indicated by several theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "multi - nucleon transfer experiments are currently performed in several facilities around the world @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming extensions of this type of measurements to more exotic and weakly bound isotopes will open new opportunities for a deeper understanding of the pairing phenomenon in nuclei where surface effects are important ( diffuseness of the surface , neutron skins , etc . ) .",
    "these future experiments may indeed provide a better insight into the spatial localization of the pairing correlations and of the cooper pairs in nuclei .",
    "recently , it has been shown by several authors that the analysis of the addition or removal modes associated to the transfer from a nucleus @xmath2 to a nucleus @xmath3 may give indications on the nature of the pairing interaction in terms of its spatial localization @xcite .",
    "in particular , ( @xmath4 ) transfer reactions for very neutron - rich sn isotopes have been suggested in ref . @xcite as possible candidates to investigate the volume and/or surface spatial properties of the pairing interaction .",
    "this indication remains however qualitative : in spite of the fact that the structure calculation for the evaluation of the form factors were fully microscopic and self - consistent in ref .",
    "@xcite , the zero - range distorted - wave born approximation employed for the reaction calculations did not allow the authors to draw quantitative conclusions on the obtained cross sections .    in ref .",
    "@xcite this issue has been discussed again by focusing only on transitions from the ground state of the nucleus @xmath2 to the ground state of the nucleus @xmath3 .",
    "several formula to calculate the associated addition and removal transition probabilities have been considered and the corresponding results compared .",
    "enhancement effects in the transition probabilities observed for some sn isotopes ( related to the use of a surface - peaked pairing interaction and also found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) have been analyzed . in ref .",
    "@xcite these effects are described in terms of radial integrals ( used to evaluate the transition probabilities ) where low-@xmath1 wave functions contribute for some very neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "these effects are amplified when surface - peaked interactions are employed because low-@xmath1 wave functions have a strong localization at the surface . in ref .",
    "@xcite the same enhancement effects in the transition probabilities have been interpreted in a complementary way within the canonical - basis picture . in this scheme , the transition probabilities are not calculated as radial integrals , but as sums of occupation probabilites .",
    "the enhancement effects related to surface - peaked interactions are due in this representation to a more pronounced fragmentation of the canonical states around the fermi energy .    a crucial aspect to consider in this type of analyses is related to the criteria that are chosen to constrain the pairing interaction . in refs .",
    "@xcite the parameters of the different pairing interactions are adjusted to reproduce the two - neutron separation energies for those even sn isotopes in the nuclear chart where masses are known experimentally . in other calculations ( for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the parameters have been fitted to reproduce the experimental gaps ( evaluated with the three - point or the five - point formula @xcite ) with a theoretical gap calculated as @xmath5 or @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pairing potential for neutrons ( @xmath8 ) or protons ( @xmath9 ) ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the nucleonic particle and anomalous densities , respectively , defined within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) framework . in both the previous procedures , that of refs .",
    "@xcite and that of ref .",
    "@xcite , the adjustment of the parameters is done only on even nuclei .",
    "as far as the second procedure is concerned , two aspects should be emphasized .",
    "first , there is an ambiguity related to the choice of the two possible quantities , eq .",
    "( 1 ) or eq . ( 2 ) , to evaluate the gap in the theoretical calculations .",
    "the two quantities may be quite different one from the other for some nuclei and for some specific choices of the pairing interaction as shown , for example , in ref .",
    "second , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are both calculated in a different way with respect to the experimental values obtained with the three- or the five - point formula .",
    "the comparison between such experimental and theoretical values is thus questionable .",
    "a third example is given in ref .",
    "@xcite where the parameters are adjusted for stable ca isotopes to reproduce the experimental gaps by using the five - point formula @xcite .",
    "the five - point formula is also used in the theoretical calculations and odd nuclei are included by using the blocking approximation .",
    "the comparison between the theorerical and the experimental values is now meaningful because the same quantities are evaluated in both cases . by using this prescription",
    ", negligible discrepancies are found in the transfer transition probabilities for ca isotopes for differently localized pairing interactions ( surface - peaked , surface / volume mixed and volume ) .",
    "however , the calculations are done only for stable nuclei and the exotic regions are not explored .",
    "furthermore , it could be interesting to check what this type of fitting procedure implies in the theoretical predictions for the pairing correlations along the isotopic chains and , in particular , at shell closures .    in this article",
    "we address two main issues : i ) analyzing how much the predictions ( and the surface effects ) related to pair - transfer reactions are affected by the procedure followed to adjust the parameters of the pairing interaction . for",
    "a surface - peaked , a mixed and a pure volume interaction , we adjust first the parameters to reproduce the experimental pairing gaps calculated with the five - point formula .",
    "odd nuclei are included in the adjustment procedure and they are treated with the blocking approximation in the hfb calculations . to fit the parameters of the neutron pairing interaction , we choose ca isotopes , from @xmath14ca to @xmath15ca .",
    "we analyze in detail what this procedure implies for the anomalous densities and calculate the corresponding trends of the two - neutron separation energies to check whether they are in a reasonable agreement with the experimental values ( this was the fitting criterium used in refs .",
    "we then generate two other sets of parameters : one obtained to have the same value of @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , for the mid - shell nucleus @xmath17ca ; the other obtained to reproduce the two - neutron separation energies from @xmath18ca to @xmath19ca .",
    "ii ) by using the different procedures to adjust the pairing interaction , we consider a case where surface effects are expected to be particularly amplified . in recent studies @xcite large odd - even staggering effects",
    "have been found in reaction cross sections of unstable ne and cr nuclei close to the neutron drip line .",
    "such strong staggering effect has been related to the existence of low-@xmath1 weakly bound states in drip line nuclei and to the associated anti - halo effect generated by the pairing interaction @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the previous predictions found by hamamoto et al .",
    "@xcite ( the pairing gap is expected to disappear for weakly bound states ) are shown to be an artificial result related to the employed approximations .",
    "this result was actually found in refs .",
    "@xcite because the calculations were not self - consistent in the determination of the fermi energy @xmath20 .",
    "this issue is associated to the more general problem of the persistence of the pairing gap in weakly bound superfluid systems , such as nuclei at the drip lines as well as nuclear clusters in the crust of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the special cases discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite may be important to unambigously disentangle among the different possible spatial localizations of the pairing interaction . in this work",
    "we analyze one of these cases , in the cr isotopic chain , and we compute the ground state to ground state pair - transfer transition probabilities at the neutron drip line to check the sensitivity of the results on the choice of the interaction .",
    "the problem of the persistence of pairing correlations at the drip lines is shown to be connected with the transfer - probability trends .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the choice of the procedure employed to adjust the parameters of the pairing interaction is discussed .",

    ", the parameter @xmath29 was adjusted in refs .",
    "@xcite to reproduce the known two - neutron separation energies of sn isotopes . by using this prescription",
    ", it was checked that the proton pairing correlations were equal to zero for all the considered isotopes and that the neutron pairing correlations were equal to zero for the doubly magic nuclei along the isotopic chain , as should be expected for calculations done within the mean - field - based hfb framework .",
    "first , we change the prescription and adjust the intensity of the pairing interaction @xmath29 on the experimental neutron pairing gaps @xmath30 evaluated with the five - point formula :    @xmath31,\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the binding energy of the nucleus .",
    "we choose the five - point formula instead of the three - point one to have more regular trends to be fitted and to avoid the odd - even staggering effect . in sec .",
    "iii we will analyze cr isotopes and calculate two - neutron transfer probabilities at their ( theoretically predicted ) neutron drip line . to perform these calculations , we need a suitable neutron pairing interaction . in principle , we should do the adjustment of the parameters for the cr isotopic chain by using the known experimental masses , that is , from @xmath33cr to @xmath34cr . however , the experimental @xmath30 values have a very irregular trend for such cr isotopes .",
    "these irregularities may be related to the fact that some isotopes are deformed and also to the presence of a proton pairing for these nuclei .",

    "it is known that for these nuclei the value of the gap @xmath30 increases owing to spurious effects that are not related to the pairing correlations but to the shell structure .",
    "our objective is to reproduce at best the trend of the gap @xmath30 , with a special care for the mid - shell nucleus @xmath17ca . to be sure that the proton pairing is negligible for all the isotopes under study",

    "this value is in good agreement with the experimental data .",

    "calculations are done there with a woods - saxon potential in the mean - field channel .",
    "we use here the skyrme parametrization skm*. the hartree - fock drip - line cr isotope is in our case the nucleus @xmath52cr ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the last bound occupied state is also the @xmath21 neutron orbital , but the orbital @xmath54 is found here between the states @xmath55 and @xmath21 .",
    "this explains why the drip line is shifted by six isotopes .",
    "the removal and addition ground state ( gs ) @xmath56 gs pair - transfer amplitudes are written as , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent spin and isospin , respectively .",

    "we have checked that , for all the employed interactions , @xmath71 , to be sure that the hfb two - neutron drip line is not predicted between @xmath70cr and @xmath52cr .",
    "the @xmath21 neutron orbital is contributing only for the nucleus @xmath52cr .    in figs . 8 and 9",
    "the transfer probabilities are plotted for the volume ( a ) , mixed ( b ) , and surface - peaked ( c ) interaction , for the parameters of tables i ( fig .",
    "8) and ii ( fig .",
    "the two equations ( 8) and ( 10 ) ( improved form ) are used .",
    "let us consider first fig .",
    "8 ( parameters of table i ) .",
    "the strengths are strongly different , according to the used pairing interaction . in particular , the strong pairing interaction for @xmath40 provides very large strengths for the transfer probabilities .",
    "the differences found in the profiles of @xmath72 are due to the following findings : the nucleus @xmath70cr is predicted almost closed - shell for @xmath41 and 1 .",
    "this leads to negligible values of @xmath73 if eq .",
    "( 8) is used .",
    "the values obtained with eq .",
    "( 10 ) are obviously larger . for @xmath41 , the nucleus @xmath52cr is also predicted closed - shell ( pairing is very weak ) and this explains why the value of @xmath73 for @xmath74 obtained with eq .",
    "( 8) is larger than that obtained with eq .",
    "( 10 ) . for @xmath39 , both nuclei @xmath75cr and @xmath52cr are predicted closed - shell , so that the two values of @xmath73 at @xmath74 , corresponding to eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 10 ) , are both very close to zero .",
    "the case @xmath40 is different .",
    "pairing correlations are much stronger and pairing is active for all the isotopes . at @xmath74 and 82 pairing is not quenched . between the results corresponding to eq .",
    "( 8) and those corresponding to eq .",
    "( 10 ) there is a shift , that means that the improved formula globally provides an enhancement of pairing correlations .",
    "let us now describe fig .",
    "9 . for @xmath41 ( a ) and 0.5 ( b ) , the same remarks as for panel ( a ) of fig . 8 may be done .",
    "the case @xmath39 ( c ) is different .",
    "like in fig .",
    "8 ( b ) , we observe that pairing is still active at the drip line ( it is not suppressed ) .",
    "there is however a very important difference with respect to panel fig .",
    "a change of slope is found at @xmath76 when eq .",
    "( 10 ) is used .",
    "this change of slope is related to a particularly pronounced enhancement of the probability at @xmath74 , where the spatial extended @xmath77 wave function contributes if eq .",
    "( 10 ) is employed .",
    "this explains why this change of slope is not found when eq .",
    "( 8) is used .",
    "the enhancement of the probability for @xmath39 is due to the interplay of the spatial extension of the @xmath77 wave function and the strong surface localization of the pairing interaction .    by looking at the two figures",
    ", one can conclude that results are very strongly case dependent in the specific values of @xmath73 . however , there are two general indications that are independent of the intensity of @xmath73 and depend only on the trends .",
    "let us consider only the full lines in the figures , because they correspond to the improved formula for the transfer probability .",
    "first , if pairing correlations are quenched at the drip lines ( suppression of pairing for weakly bound systems at the drip lines ) , it is expected that the probability describing the transfer from the nucleus @xmath78 to the nucleus @xmath79 ( where @xmath79 is the drip line nucleus ) is smaller than the probability associated to the transfer @xmath80 ( panels ( a ) and ( c ) of fig . 8 and ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "second , the opportunity to analyze the surface properties of the pairing interaction obviously exists only if pairing survives at the drip line . in this case , a strongly surface - peaked interaction leads to a change of slope in the trends of the transition probabilities ( panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "this special case ( @xmath77 state contributing at the drip line and pairing not suppressed ) may thus provide a chance to better understand if the pairing interaction is strongly localized at the surface of nuclei or not , by simply looking at the trend of the transfer probabilities . if the change of slope is not found in measurements",
    ", one can exclude strongly surface - peaked pairing interactions .",
    "as mentioned above , the problem of the persistence of pairing at the drip lines is tightly connected with this .",
    "let us now use the parameters of table iii to calculate the transfer probabilities with the pairing interactions that reproduce at best the @xmath43 trends .",
    "cr to @xmath52cr , for the volume ( a ) , the mixed ( b ) and the surface - peaked ( c ) interactions of table i.,width=302 ]            fig .",
    "10 shows the resulting strengths .",
    "the same comments as for fig .",
    "9 can be done .",
    "if pairing persists at the drip line , then @xmath72 increases from @xmath76 to @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , a change of slope is predicted in this case for a surface - peaked interaction that amplifies the contribution of the weakly bound @xmath77 state .",
    "we have computed two - neutron transfer probabilities at the ( theoretically predicted ) neutron drip lines of cr isotopes , where the last occupied state is the weakly bound neutron @xmath21 orbital .",
    "we have examined different procedures to adjust a phenomenological pairing interaction in the framework of the hfb model and check the implications of each chosen procedure .",
    "three differently spatially located ( volume , mixed and surface - peaked ) pairing interactions have been generated for each adjustment procedure .",
    "the values of the resulting probabilities are very strongly case dependent .",
    "however , a general conclusion can be drawn : if pairing correlations persist at the drip line , a pure surface - peaked interaction would provide not only increasing transfer probabilities from @xmath76 ( @xmath81cr @xmath56 @xmath75cr ) to @xmath74 ( @xmath75cr @xmath56 @xmath52cr ) , but also a change of slope in the trend at @xmath76 .",
    "the change of slope originates from an interplay between the spatial extension of the @xmath77 wave function and the surface localization of the pairing interaction .",
    "an interaction that is not surface - peaked leads only to increasing transfer probabilities if pairing is not suppressed .",
    "if , on the contrary , pairing is suppressed at the drip line , the transfer probability is expected to decrease going from @xmath76 to @xmath74 .    to conclude , the analysis of cr isotopes at the drip line can thus offer the opportunity to clarify two aspects : the persistence or suppression of pairing correlations at nuclear drip lines and the surface properties of the pairing interaction .",
    "we are of course aware that these isotopes can not be produced with the present facilities and that , so far , only theoretical studies may be carried out in such region of the nuclear chart , like in refs .",
