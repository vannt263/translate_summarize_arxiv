    "at a time when the lhc is getting ready to open a new era in particle physics , it is legitimate to ask why one should still be interested in qcd ( more generally in the standard model ) at low energies .",
    "there are at least two good reasons to pursue the study of qcd in the confinement regime .    * it is a challenge for theoretical particle physics to derive reliable results in the nonperturbative domain .",
    "an impressive example is pion - pion scattering , one of the few examples in hadron phenomenology at low energies where theory is ahead of experiment @xcite .",
    "important information on the mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking can be extracted from pion - pion scattering , especially from s - wave scattering lengths .",
    "the study of qcd in the nonperturbative regime may turn out to be relevant even for lhc physics if the simple higgs mechanism of the standard model turns out to be insufficient to describe electroweak symmetry breaking . *",
    "the assessment of physics beyond the standard model will remain an important research topic even at much lower than lhc energies .",
    "the reduction in energy must be compensated by an increase in precision , both in experiment and in theory . in the long run",
    ", lattice gauge theories and low - energy effective field theories will survive as the most comprehensive and reliable approaches in this field .",
    "in this talk , i present a short progress report on chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , which is precisely the effective field theory of the standard model at low energies .",
    "green functions and amplitudes are dominated at low energies by the exchange of pseudoscalar mesons , the pseudo - goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , allowing for a systematic expansion in momenta and quark masses .",
    "i discuss recent progress in determining some of the a priori unknown coupling constants of chpt , a recent chpt analysis of @xmath0 decays to extract the ckm matrix element @xmath1 and , finally , very recent developments concerning the determination of hadronic vacuum polarization , a topic of great importance for comparing the standard model prediction of the muon magnetic moment with experiment .",
    "the extension of chpt to the intermediate - energy region dominated by meson resonances is covered by j. portols @xcite .",
    "the spontaneously and explicitly broken chiral symmetry of qcd is the key feature of chpt .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is organized in an expansion in derivatives ( vestige of spontaneous symmetry breaking ) and in quark masses ( explicit breaking ) .",
    "chpt is a nonrenormalizable quantum field theory that must nevertheless be renormalized like any respectable quantum field theory .",
    "the main difference to renormalizable theories is the rapidly increasing number of low - energy constants ( lecs ) in higher orders of chpt . as a low - energy effective field theory ,",
    "chpt can be applied to processes with momenta @xmath2 1 gev .    in the mesonic sector ,",
    "the original effective chiral lagrangian of next - to - leading order @xcite has been extended to next - to - next - to - leading order @xcite or @xmath3 in the standard chiral counting . at this order , diagrams with up to",
    "two loops have to be taken into account for a consistent low - energy expansion ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .    still in the meson sector",
    ", the formalism of chpt has been extended to incorporate the nonleptonic weak interactions and to implement radiative corrections for strong processes as well as for semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays .",
    "the corresponding lagrangians and the associated number of lecs are displayed in table [ tab : eftsm ] .",
    "as the table indicates , the state of the art for these extensions is next - to - leading order with at most one - loop amplitudes .",
    ".the effective chiral lagrangian of the sm in the meson sector .",
    "the numbers in brackets refer to the number of independent couplings for @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter - free wess - zumino - witten action that can not be written as the four - dimensional integral of an invariant lagrangian must be added . [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     a second independent consistency check of the data comes from a comparison of the two sides in eq .",
    "( [ fesr ] ) for different values of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "when plotting the spectral integrals as functions of @xmath5 one arrives at a similar conclusion as before : the slopes in the electromagnetic case differ by about 2.5 @xmath6 between data and qcd . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7 data show perfect consistency both for the slope and in absolute normalization ( depending on @xmath8 ) .    the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite are very convincing even if the statistical weight is not overwhelming : the sum rule tests clearly favour the @xmath7 over the @xmath9 data .",
    "the status of @xmath10 at the time of the workshop can be summarized as follows @xcite : @xmath11\\\\ 7.6 \\pm 8.9 & ( 0.9 ~\\sigma ) ~~[\\tau , e^+ e^- ] \\end{array } \\right . ~.\\ ] ] using the isospin corrected @xmath7 data for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 final states thus leads to agreement between theory and experiment to better than 1 @xmath6 .",
    "two weeks after the workshop , new @xmath14 data were released @xcite that appear to lie between the cmd-2 and the ( isospin corrected ) aleph data .",
    "in the meson sector , chiral perturbation theory has been pushed to next - to - next - to - leading order . at this order ,",
    "the main limitation for further progress is the abundance of coupling constants , an unavoidable feature of a nonrenormalizable effective field theory .",
    "some progress has been made recently in estimating those constants by using large-@xmath15 methods to interpolate between chpt and qcd .",
    "chpt is the only reliable approach for calculating electromagnetic and isospin violating corrections for hadronic processes at low energies .",
    "this is in particular important for the analysis of @xmath0 decays in order to extract the ckm matrix element @xmath1 to better than 1 % accuracy .",
    "recent sum rule tests @xcite favour @xmath7 over @xmath16 data for evaluating the hadronic vacuum polarization at low and intermediate energies . as a consequence",
    ", there is at present no conflict between the standard model and experiment for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "this work has been supported in part by hprn - ct2002 - 00311 ( euridice ) .",
    "i thank helmut neufeld for discussions and for numerical help with the ratio @xmath17 .",
