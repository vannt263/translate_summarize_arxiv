    "random dispersion of waves is found in the figures * 5 * and * 7*. figure * 3 * shows that the waves damp in a small region near the event horizon . in figures * 4 * and * 5 * , the waves grow near the event horizon in a small region . in figure * 9 * , the attenuation vector increases with the decrease in @xmath1 in a small region near the event horizon . in figures * 1 * -*9 * , the waves damp and grow randomly with the increase in angular frequency .",
    "for the * isothermal plasma * surrounding the schwarzschild black hole , figure * 14 * admits normal dispersion near the event horizon .",
    "the waves disperse anomalously in figure * 11*. in figure * 10 * , the attenuation vector increases whereas it decreases for figure * 11 * with the increase in angular frequency .",
    "it shows that the waves damp in figure * 10 * and grow for figure * 11 * with the increase in angular frequency .",
    "figure * 12 * shows that the wave grow and damp randomly with the increase in angular frequency . in figures * 15 * and * 16 * , the waves grow in a small region near the event horizon . in figure * 17 * , the waves damp whereas they grow in figures * 18 * and * 21 * with the decrease in @xmath1 in small regions near the event horizon . in figures",
    "* 19 * and * 20 * , the attenuation vector decreases with the increase in angular frequency .    for the cold plasma living in the non - rotating schwarzschild background , there exists a case where the waves disperse normally ( figure * 1 * ) whereas for the isothermal plasma , normal dispersion lies at random points . in the rotating non - magnetized background ,",
    "the cold plasma shows normal dispersion in figure * 3 * whereas the isothermal plasma admits normal dispersion in a small region near the event horizon in figure * 14*. in the rotating magnetized background , figure * 8 * indicates that the cold plasma admits normal dispersion in most of the region whereas the isothermal plasma admits normal dispersion at random points .",
    "thus we can conclude that the pressure ceases the normal dispersion of waves .    in most of the cases , the refractive index increases as the waves move towards the event horizon in a small region near the event horizon .",
    "this shows that the refraction of waves increases as they move towards the event horizon .",
    "for all the backgrounds of cold and isothermal plasma , the propagation vector takes negative values which shows that the waves move towards the event horizon .",
