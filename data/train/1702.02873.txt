    "the electroencephalographic ( eeg ) activity in preterm infants is characterized by discontinuous patterns , alternating quiescence periods with slow , high voltage transients or bursts , continuously evolving during infancy .",
    "inter - burst intervals ( ibis ) provide valuable information about progostation and maturation as they progressively decrease in duration with increasing age in healthy preterm infants @xcite .",
    "as preterm infants reach term age ( 37 to 40 pma ) eeg becomes more complex , but immature patterns are still present @xcite . at this stage ,",
    "a _ trac alternant _",
    "( an alternating pattern of bursts and relatively quiet periods @xcite ) predominates in quiet sleep , but long ibis may appear , suggesting an abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome @xcite .",
    "therefore , studying ibis and transients in the eeg after term equivalent ages can be useful as an early prognostic tool @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the study of ibis is not a clinical routine in neonatal intensive care units ( nicus ) and , to our knowledge , it is not existent in portable and home monitoring devices . in effect , nicus prioritize other vital signs over electroencephalography , which is tedious and time - consuming .",
    "moreover , the manual recognition of ibis and bursts is , still , another laborious and subjective task requiring trained neurologists .",
    "the automation of this procedure would therefore save time costs , avoid disagreement between different annotators and , in turn , gain attractiveness as a monitoring tool in the nicu .",
    "this challenge has motivated a number of works that propose different approaches , including supervised learning ( single or multi - feature based ) and clustering .",
    "the choice of the most appropriate solution is not always straightforward and relies on both clinical ( e.g. infants age , developmental problems ) and technical criteria ( e.g number of available channels ) .",
    "the vast majority of existing algorithms have been designed for burst suppression applications both in adults ( anesthesia or coma monitoring ) and full - term newborns ( eeg monitoring after perinatal asphyxia ) , but only a few works design burst detectors for preterm eeg .",
    "even if similarities exist , burst suppression patterns are related to a clinical condition whereas preterm s bursts describe the normal eeg and evolve during postnatal life . in table 1",
    ", we provide a summary of the works published over the last two decades related to preterm burst detection as well as some relevant solutions for burst suppression in full - term infants and adults .",
    "if the brain activity needs to be segmented into burst and ibis , binary classification or regression can be employed .",
    "although this constitutes the norm of burst classification , in certain cases a third class ( artefacts @xcite , continuous pattern @xcite ) or other categories ( classification of different degrees of activity after asphyxia @xcite ) can be considered . in burst detection",
    ", single - feature detectors are often preferred when the eeg patterns are predominantly dichotomous , with low frequency deflections from the baseline that allow the use of direct measures ( such as voltage amplitude ) or functions applied on the eeg ( such as energy ) as only feature .",
    "dichotomous patterns can be found in a variety of altered states of consciousness @xcite , but in healthy preterm infants they are characteristic of ages below 32 weeks pma @xcite .",
    "single - feature detectors are fast and can be easily implemented by simple thresholding , successfully employed for burst detection using a single eeg channel in very preterm infants @xcite with teager - kaiser operator @xcite .",
    "this operator ( also known as nonlinear energy operator , nleo ) , and its variants @xcite are widely employed for eeg burst detection ( see table 1 ) . for multichannel data",
    ", thresholding has been successfully applied in successive steps using eeg power @xcite , nleo @xcite or using line length as feature @xcite .    in general , using a single feature performs fairly well for very immature patterns , but as eeg complexity increases , supplementary descriptors are needed .",
    "thus , detecting eeg patterns in full - term newborns often requires the use of several features , as those derived from wavelet analysis for _ trac alternant _ detection @xcite or a variety of time and frequency - based descriptors for burst suppression detectors @xcite . in this work",
    ", we address the detection of bursts in very preterm infants who reached term - equivalent ages ( tea ) .",
    "considering the growing field of portable eeg headsets and wearable sensors , we studied the viability of burst detection using a single eeg channel . logistic regression ( lr )",
    "is evaluated by using experts visual marks and compared to other popular multi - feature methods such as linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) , svm , k - nearest neighbor ( knn ) and the most commonly used single - feature classifier : thresholding ( th ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is as follows : section [ data ] describes the database , the evaluation subset and the construction of reference labels . in section [ meth ] , we present the employed classifiers and the evaluation methodology .",
    "section [ resultat ] compares automatic and visual detections and shows the results of applying the lr based classifier to assess the maturation in our cohort .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are drawn in section [ dc ] .",
    "thirty - one very preterm infants , born after 27 to 29 weeks of gestation , were recorded at the chu hospital at rennes ( france ) to study the effects of immunization ( see @xcite for more details about the protocol ) .",
    "only pre - immunization recordings were considered in the present work to avoid eventual perturbations following the administration of vaccine .",
    "infants , who presented a normal outcome and had discharged home , accounted for at least seven weeks of postnatal life ( 36 to 41 weeks pma ) during the recordings .",
    "the study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee ( _ comit de protection des personnes _ , cpp ouest 6 - 598 , france ) and a written informed consent was given by parents .",
    "for each newborn , two eeg channels were acquired at sampling frequency @xmath1=512 hz using a brainz@xmath2  bedside monitor ( natus medical incorporated , san carlos , usa ) during 2 to 3 hours .",
    "hydrogel surface electrodes were placed in fronto - parietal and temporal positions , corresponding approximately to the fp1 , fp2 , t3 and t4 locations of 10 - 20 standard systems .",
    "a bipolar reference was applied to obtain the channel pairs fp1-t3 and fp2-t4 .",
    "additionally , electrocardiogram ( ecg ) , respiratory activity and hypnograms ( annotations of the sleep stages in conformity to the neonatal standard @xcite ) were available .",
    "labels to validate the classifiers and compute human / automated agreements was provided by two experienced neonatologists who marked manually ( in burst / ibi periods ) an evaluation subset .",
    "visual evaluations were carried out on a selection of @xmath3=14 infants ( 36.1 to 39.7 weeks pma ) from the above described database .",
    "each infant provided an eeg excerpt of @xmath4 seconds . to ensure the existence of discontinuous or semi - discontinuous patterns , only segments free of artifacts in quiet sleep",
    "were considered .    using a computer program designed to this purpose , the two clinicians ( a and b ) marked the bursts limits in 20-second windows displaying the pre - processed eeg .",
    "they were asked to perform the visual interpretations a second time in a different day .",
    "visually marked bursts were then converted to discrete , binary series that coded bursts with ones and ibis with zeros .",
    "each category was associated , respectively with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "visual evaluations yielded four binary arrays @xmath7 of length @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the rater s code and @xmath10 is the repetition number .",
    "the gold standard , i.e. reference data to train and test the classification algorithms , was generated by merging the experts evaluations .",
    "we first constructed unified marks for each rater , @xmath11 , by including the bursts of the two replicates : @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath9 .",
    "then , we defined the gold standard , @xmath14 , as in @xcite , i.e. the unanimous decisions between clinicians marks .",
    "intervals without agreement were not considered and labeled as empty values (  ) : @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath9 .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] .",
    "to test the different burst detectors , we employed the general scheme that can be divided in three main blocks : pre - processing , feature extraction and classification ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : blocks ] ) .",
    "the content of some blocks depend on the classification approach .      in this block ,",
    "signal - to - noise ratios in eeg signals are improved by applying artifact correction or rejection and filters . due to prone position and nursing ,",
    "certain artifacts are typically more abundant in one channel . here , the less contaminated one is selected regarding its statistical properties ( variance , kurtosis , joint probability of eeg activity values @xcite ) .",
    "then , a linear phase band - pass filter whose respective lower and upper cut - off frequencies are set to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , is applied .",
    "cut - off frequencies can vary depending if baseline and high frequency noise needs to be attenuated or if a specific bandwidth wants to be enhanced .",
    "the resulting signal , @xmath19 , is finally sub - sampled to 128 hz .",
    "this block computes a number of functions on @xmath19 to obtain a feature vector @xmath20 with @xmath21 the number of features , and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the number of windows of @xmath19 .",
    "features , chosen to capture pronounced characteristics in bursts ( see table 2 ) , have already been exploited to solve eeg classification problems . since @xmath24 are computed in overlapping @xmath25-second windows , the effective sampling rate of features with respect to @xmath19 is reduced . hence slow trends were enhanced over fast transients by performing a smoothing of @xmath24 as suggested by @xcite . to this purpose",
    "we applied a 1-dimensional , 10th order median filter on each feature @xcite .",
    "finally , to avoid outliers that might decrease classification performances , @xmath24 was quantile - normalized to impose their values to fall within the 1st and 99st percentiles @xcite .",

    "the proposed classifier based on logistic regression and its competitors are described below .",
    "provided that short bursts or ibis rarely exist , the output of the classifiers were also smoothed to improve the performance of detections .",
    "hence , the output of this block , @xmath42 , was finally obtained by removing isolated events below a given time in seconds , @xmath43 , applying a filtering procedure similar than @xcite .",
    "predictive models based on logistic regression has been successfully employed in a variety of biomedical domains @xcite .",
    "unlike binary classifiers , that are purely dichotomous , lr provides the class probability for one of the two categories .    in logistic regression @xcite",
    ", the class probability @xmath44 is expressed through a function called logit , related to the feature vector @xmath24 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 $ ] is the vector of regression coefficients and @xmath47 is the intercept .",
    "the inverse of the above expression , called logistic function , is expressed as : @xmath48 an important characteristic of the logistic function is that it is bounded between 0 and 1 , and thus , it can be used directly to estimate the probabilities of the possible outcomes as @xmath49 .",
    "given the pair of features and labels \\{@xmath50 } , the learning process aims at finding the best @xmath51 , which is to maximize the conditional probabilities @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by the maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) method .",
    "we employed the newton - raphson s hill - climbing algorithm , an iterative procedure that maximizes the log likelihood function until a convergence criterion ( coefficients leading to the most accurate predictions ) is reached .",
    "once the optimal coefficients , @xmath53 , are obtained , class probabilities , @xmath54 , are provided by the logistic function .",
    "the class membership is decided by a cut - off value @xmath55 such that @xmath56 assigns the predictive output value , @xmath57 , to class 1 , and @xmath58 assigns @xmath57 to class 0 . here , we fixed @xmath55 to 0.5 .      in this paper , we have also evaluated the detection of bursts using three widely employed multi - feature , supervised classifiers suitable for binary classification problems : linear discriminant analysis , support vector machines and the k - nearest neighbor technique .",
    "they are briefly described below .",
    "linear discriminant analysis can be applied to solve two - class classification problems simply and efficiently based on the characteristics of each class ( mean , covariance matrix ) @xcite .",
    "the lda classifier finds a discriminant function , i.e. the linear combination of the multi - dimensional features that best separates the two classes .",
    "this function provides scores for each class , being the highest values associated to more likely classes .",
    "the svm is a very popular machine learning technique used in a variety of applications  @xcite .",
    "this classifier uses a transformation ( kernel ) function to project the data into a higher dimensional space , where classes may become linearly separable .",
    "more versatile than linear kernel functions , we used a gaussian radial basis function ( rbf ) to guarantee the existence of a non - linear decision boundary : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote two feature vectors and the kernel parameter @xmath62 is the radius of influence of the learning samples selected as support vectors by the model .",
    "the other parameter in svms , the weight of the soft margin cost function ( @xmath63 ) @xcite , needs to be adjusted for an optimal decision boundary .",
    "while small values provides `` local '' solutions over - fitting the model , high values tend to simplify boundaries an may not provide accurate separations .",
    "both parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 were optimized by the sequential minimal optimization method ( smo ) @xcite .",
    "the knn is a nonparametric and nonlinear classifier based on proximity criteria .",
    "given the training set of features , the algorithm identifies the @xmath64 closest neighbor vectors to classify a new instance . the class assigned to the new instance",
    "is then decided by majority vote , i.e. the class accounting for more neighbors .",
    "the value of @xmath64 was set as the square root of the number of instances @xcite .",
    "thresholding is a simple technique that can be employed when one - dimensional feature vectors @xmath65 can be partitioned in two disjoint regions ( classes ) by a threshold @xmath66 . to find @xmath66 , an optimization procedure that maximizes the agreements with the gold standard",
    "is performed .",
    "new instances are then classified by a simple rule : if the feature value exceeds @xmath66 , it is labeled as @xmath67 , otherwise as @xmath6 .",
    "we employed the thresholding approach proposed by palmu et al .",
    "briefly , it consists on first pre - processing eeg by a band - pass filter with cut - off frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "next , the feature ( given by the nleo operator ) is computed in @xmath25-second windows so that values over @xmath66 provided a first classification , corrected in a second instance by eliminating bursts below @xmath68 . by means of an iterative process ,",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath25 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 were optimized to obtain a maximum agreement with their gold standard .",
    "we simplified this procedure by optimizing @xmath66 and imposing the remaining parameters ( see section [ subsec : optim ] ) .      to assess the degree of agreement within human raters and between human and automatic classifications , we employed the cohen s kappa coefficient @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the observed agreement among raters ( the proportion of windows where the observers agreed ) and @xmath71 is the probability expected by chance .",
    "the upper limit of this statistic ( @xmath72 ) occurs only when there is perfect agreement .",
    "the lower limit ( @xmath73 ) depends on the marginal distributions and occurs when agreements are due to chance @xcite .",
    "the performance of the classifiers was evaluated by accuracy and receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves .",
    "accuracy ( @xmath74 ) is defined as the percentage of windows correctly classified over the total number of windows in each labeled eeg .",
    "roc curves represent a sensitivity / specificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold .",
    "the area under the roc curves ( auc ) summarizes the overall ability of the classifiers to discriminate between the two classes and ranges from 0.5 ( random classification ) to 1 ( perfect classification ) .    to obtain unbiased estimations of accuracy and auc ,",
    "the performance of the classifiers was examined in infants that did not take part in the training process .",
    "hence , leave - one - out cross - validation ( loocv ) was applied :    1 .",
    "leave out a single sample from the evaluation subset composed by @xmath3=14 infants .",
    "2 .   build the classification model with the remaining data ( @xmath3 - 1 ) .",
    "test the omitted sample with the learned model .",
    "4 .   repeat the above steps until each sample has been omitted and tested once .",
    "filter cut - off frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath18 were set to 0.1  30 hz for multi - feature classifiers .",
    "for the simple detection by thresholding , these values were modified ( 0.5  8 hz ) to meet de requirements of @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "features were computed by 75% overlapping windows of @xmath25=1 second .",
    "this choice is justified by the minimal duration of the bursts in the gold standard but also by a trade - off between reasonable resolution ( 0.25 s ) and computational time .",
    "the minimal burst time , @xmath68 was set to 1 second .",
    "we proceeded then to select the most relevant features for lda , svm , knn and lr .",
    "feature matrix was composed , per each infant , by 1197 rows ( data points ) and 8 columns ( features ) .",
    "given that the number of features is low with respect the number of observations , a wrapper feature selection method was employed .",
    "the most relevant features were retained by sequential forward selection ( sfs ) , i.e. subsets of features are iteratively combined based on the classifier performance until a maximum is reached .",
    "the maximal performance was evaluated by the mean accuracy yielded by loocv . the number of retained features obtained by sfs depended on the classification method . while lda reached the best accuracy using only two features ( @xmath26 , @xmath31 ) , svm needed all excepting @xmath41 . for the knn method ,",
    "five features were selected ( @xmath26 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 ) and lr retained three features ( @xmath26 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 ) . of note , @xmath41 were discarded by all classifiers , suggesting that it may be redundant or poorly correlated with the labels . on the other hand , @xmath26 constituted the most relevant feature as it was selected in all cases .",
    "the performance of the classifiers in terms of aucs and accuracies are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : box_compar ] ) .",
    "accuracies were almost identical by using lr , svm and knn ( @xmath75 95% ) .",
    "little differences exist between these methods when comparing confidence intervals and dispersion .",
    "the lda was slightly below ( 94% ) and thresholding was the least performing ( 84% ) .",
    "lr resulted computationally simpler ( uses only 3 features ) , faster and more intuitive method than the other classifiers as it provides directly the probability of burst ( ease of setting a working point by simply changing the cut - off value @xmath55 ) .",
    "our results revealed that thresholding performed poorly compared to burst detection on more immature infants ( 23 - 28 w pma ) , with @xmath74=90% in average @xcite .",
    "indeed , the single feature employed by this algorithm does not describe properly the eeg complexity in older populations of preterm infants .",
    "therefore , additional features need to be included in the classification model .",
    "even if accuracies provided by lr , svm and knn are in the same levels of some of the existing burst suppression detectors in full - terms @xcite and above burst / ibi classifiers for preterms @xcite , performances should be compared with caution as they are subject to the design of the gold standard .",
    "thus , the comparison of automatic detections with those obtained by human raters will provide a more realistic idea of the behavior of the classifiers .",
    "the evaluation subset also served to compare the agreements within raters and between raters and the classifiers . for human observations ,",
    "kappa coefficients were , in average , equal to 0.62 .",
    "this result improves reported values in populations @xmath7730 weeks pma @xcite ( mean @xmath78=0.58 ) . in terms of accuracy ,",
    "our mean agreement equals 81% , a satisfactory result if compared to values obtained in younger cohorts , for instance 81% in 28 to 30 w pma infants @xcite or 80% in 29 to 34 w pma @xcite . in our experiment",
    ", discordance was mainly found at the beginning and end of bursts and in few cases concerned a entire burst .    .",
    "]    comparing the kappa coefficients in fig .",
    "[ fig : vis_vs_aut ] , it can be stated that automatic - human values are increased with respect to human - human rates .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the gold standard used to train the classifiers is an intermediate reference , i.e. from raters unanimous decisions .",
    "both lr and svm yielded best averaged human - automatic agreements ( @xmath78=0.71 , @xmath74=86% ) , but for computational efficiency , lr was our method of choice for the study of maturation presented in section [ appl ] .",
    "in neonatology , maturational patterns are often assessed from the quantitative analysis of eeg bursts . here , we compared the following measures , also referred to as discontinuity parameters :    * number of bursts per minute ( @xmath79 ) * mean duration of bursts ( @xmath80 ) * mean duration of ibis ( @xmath81 ) * maximal duration of ibis ( @xmath82 )    as it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : charact_bursts ] , values from automated detections are intermediate to those obtained by the raters , excepting @xmath79 ( whose median is over the values obtained by manual marks ) . regarding this parameter , differences between lr and b were statistically significant whereas differences between lr and a were not .",
    "significant differences concerning the rest of comparisons with lr can not be considered relevant as there were also significant differences between a and b ( see horizontal lines in fig .",

    "infants having sufficiently long periods in quiet sleep ( @xmath83300 seconds ) were selected from the main database , discarding too short , unstable sleep patterns . this allowed us to retain @xmath84=20 of 31 newborns who summed up approximately 2 hours of eeg signals .",
    "then , we divided the cohort in two set of groups according the median pma and weight .",
    "this allowed to compare the degree of maturity by age ( group @xmath85 = [ 36 , 38.2 ] versus group @xmath86 = [ 38.2 , 40 ] w. pma ) and by weight ( group @xmath87 = [ 1.36 , 2.50 ] versus @xmath88 = [ 2.50 , 2.86 ] kg ) . the four discontinuity parameters before described plus the percentage of bursts ( @xmath89 ) were calculated from the detections yielded by the lr classifier ( see table [ tab : burst_matur_qs ] ) .",

    "the present paper addressed the eeg burst detection problem in very preterm infants who reached term age using multi - feature classification .",
    "the comparative study showed that the classifier based on logistic regression has the best performances in terms of accuracy and computational costs , improving the widely employed thresholding approach and most of the multi - feature classifiers for burst detection proposed in the literature . indeed , our results benefit from the selection of the channel having the lowest degree of artifacts and from the inclusion of the appropriate burst descriptors by the most relevant features .",
    "however , the fact that the analyzed eeg corresponded to quiet sleep periods and the high inter - rater agreements might contribute to the high mean accuracy rate ( 95% ) and mean auc ( 0.99 ) obtained with the best classifier .",
    "moreover , it must be said that these performances do not take into account the possible classification errors in disagreeing zones since the gold standard used to train the algorithms was build from consensual annotations @xcite .",

    "<S> the study of electroencephalographic ( eeg ) bursts in preterm infants provides valuable information about maturation or prognostication after perinatal asphyxia . over the last two decades , a number of works proposed algorithms to automatically detect eeg bursts in preterm infants , but they were designed for populations under 35 weeks of post menstrual age ( pma ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the brain activity evolves rapidly during postnatal life , these solutions might be under - performing with increasing pma . in this work we focused on preterm infants reaching term ages ( pma @xmath0 36 weeks ) using multi - feature classification on a single eeg channel . </S>",
    "<S> five eeg burst detectors relying on different machine learning approaches were compared : logistic regression ( lr ) , linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) , k - nearest neighbors ( knn ) , support vector machines ( svm ) and thresholding ( th ) . </S>",
    "<S> classifiers were trained by visually labeled eeg recordings from 14 very preterm infants ( born after 28 weeks of gestation ) with 36  41 weeks pma . </S>",
    "<S> the most performing classifiers reached about 95% accuracy ( knn , svm and lr ) whereas th obtained 84% . </S>",
    "<S> compared to human - automatic agreements , lr provided the highest scores ( cohen s kappa = 0.71 ) and the best computational efficiency using only three eeg features . applying this classifier in a test database of 21 infants @xmath0 36 weeks pma , </S>",
    "<S> we show that long eeg bursts and short inter - bust periods are characteristic of infants with the highest pma and weights . in view of these results , </S>",
    "<S> lr - based burst detection could be a suitable tool to study maturation in monitoring or portable devices using a single eeg channel .    * eeg bursts , preterm infants , automated detection , logistic regression * </S>"
