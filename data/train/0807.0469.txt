    "the lupus survey was a deep transit survey of a 0.66 square degree patch of sky near the galactic plane ( b=11@xmath0 ) .",
    "the survey was conducted using the anu 40 inch telescope at siding spring observatory , australia in may and june of 2005 and 2006 . in total",
    ", 1783 good quality images of the field were obtained .",
    "the images were 5-minute exposures taken in a wide v+r filter .",
    "time series photometry was performed for 110,372 stars in the field , with 16,134 of those stars having a precision of @xmath1 .",
    "the transiting planet candidates and results from this survey will be published in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bayliss et al . ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "the discovery of a hot jupiter in the field , lupus - tr-3b , has been published in a separate letter ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* weldrake et al . (",
    "2008 ) ) ) , and the radial velocity follow - up confirming the discovery is set out in  figure  [ lupus3 ] .",
    "additionally , 494 new variables were discovered in the survey field .",
    "these variables have been cataloged in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* weldrake & bayliss ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "the duration of a transit survey is critical to its prospects of success , and underestimating required durations may have contributed to early surveys not discovering transiting planets in the numbers expected ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pont , zucker , & queloz ( 2006 ) ) ) .",
    "we modeled the effect of increasing our survey duration by looking at the transit recoverability for hot jupiters as a function of planetary period and the duration of the survey .",
    "we created 1000 transiting hot jupiters in each of 7 period bins , ranging from to 7 - 8  days .",
    "each transit lightcurve was given a random phase .",
    "we then convolved these transits with a window function out to 100 nights based on actual weather logs taken from the siding spring observatory site .",
    "a detection was equated with observing the equivalent of three full transits .",
    "the results of the simulation are plotted .",
    "these results indicate that by 100 nights ( the superlupus duration ) we will detect nearly all transiting hot jupiters in the field with periods from 1 to 3 days .",
    "the fraction of longer period hot jupiters we can detect will rise significantly from the original lupus survey , especially planets with 5 - 8 day periods , to which the original survey was very insensitive .",
    "our new dataset should also allow us to increase our sensitivity to smaller radius planets , as more data - points in the lightcurve will increase our s / n .",
    "based on these simulations , we have initiated the superlupus project to expand the original lupus transit survey by imaging the field again in 2008 . the instrument set - up and observational strategy is identical to that used in the original survey ( see table [ survey ] ) .",
    "data has now been taken in the months of march , april and may 2008 .",
    "we have approximately 2500 new images , and expect at least 70% of these will be of sufficient quality to use in the production of high precision time series photometry .",
    "the photometry for the original survey was produced using difference imaging analysis ( dia : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* alard & lupton ( 1998 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wozniak ( 2000 ) ) ) .",
    "this method is well suited to crowded fields .",
    "the lupus field is _ moderately _ crowded , being only 11@xmath0 above the galactic plane . in order to test how aperture photometry will compare to the dia photometry in this rgime",
    ", we used the iraf package daophot and the source extractor software ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bertin & arnouts ( 1996 ) ) ) to produce time series photometry on a small subset of the 2006 images .",
    "these tests indicated that source extractor , with its more sophisticated background subtraction , gave slightly better results than daophot for our images , and that it compared well to dia photometry .",
    "source extractor is also a very fast algorithm , and this will allow us to perform photometry using multiple apertures and select the one best suited to the star and its environment ."
