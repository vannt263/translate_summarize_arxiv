    "the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have recently reported discovery of a new particle consistent with the higgs boson of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "each experiment independently reports nearly @xmath4 combined local significance for a mass of @xmath5 , largely fueled by the searches for resonances in diphoton and @xmath6 final states .    the discovery of the higgs marks the final chapter in the quest to discover the particle content of the standard model .",
    "it also represents the start of a new era of higgs physics at the lhc . with additional data and further analyses",
    "the experiments will be able to study the properties of this new particle , in particular its production modes and decay branching ratios .",
    "the standard model makes very definite predictions for these properties ( up to calculational uncertainties ) given the mass of the higgs , so any significant deviation from the expected values would be an immediate sign of new physics .",
    "there are many ways that physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) can manifest itself in higgs events .",
    "one possibility is that the higgs couplings to known sm particles are modified by new physics , such as loop effects of new particles , mixing of the higgs with other new states ( extended higgs sectors ) , and higgs compositeness .",
    "such effects will modify both the decay branching ratios and production modes of the higgs , potentially giving observable deviations from sm predictions .",
    "several works perform general analyses of these possibilities in the context of recent lhc higgs results @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is that on - shell production of bsm particles can lead to higgs production in the decay cascade .",
    "this possibility has been discussed as a discovery mode for an sm - like higgs boson in several models  @xcite , for the extra higgs states of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and its extensions  @xcite , and for composite higgs models @xcite .",
    "conversely , the discovery sensitivity for bsm physics through higgs production has been studied in the context of the mssm with a bino lsp  @xcite , a gravitino lsp  @xcite , and additional feebly coupled lsps @xcite , as well as in the context of vector - like heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "higgs production in cascade decays has also been studied as a way to probe the details of the the spectra and couplings of bsm particles after their discovery  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider a class of susy models with neutralino nlsps which dominantly decay to a higgs boson .",
    "in particular we focus on models with light third generation squarks , which are motivated by naturalness of the electroweak scale .",
    "such models can remain unconstrained by existing susy searches while still having total susy production cross sections at the 7 or 8 tev lhc of up to a few picobarns comparable to the total sm higgs production cross section and significantly larger than the cross section for associated production in the sm",
    ". the sensitivity of susy searches is limited due to the suppression of missing energy when a light nlsp ( @xmath7 ) decays to a higgs and the lsp , as has been explored previously in more general models  @xcite .",
    "the dominant decays for a light higgs are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and much of the existing work on bsm higgs production has focused on these modes .",
    "the @xmath10 mode suggests search channels with many @xmath1 s or searches for ` higgs - tagged ' boosted jets  @xcite , while the @xmath9 decay suggests searches in leptonic channels with missing energy .",
    "the many-@xmath1 modes have large qcd backgrounds when the met signature is suppressed , while the leptonic modes have smaller branching fractions and can have significant backgrounds as well .",
    "furthermore , it can be difficult to link a new physics signal with the higgs in these channels , especially in the presence of other hard objects from the susy cascade .",
    "we will focus instead on the potential for observing such models using the rare but distinctive diphoton decay mode of the higgs , which has a branching fraction of 0.22% for a 125 gev sm higgs .",
    "we show that searches requiring a diphoton with invariant mass near 125 gev plus other objects such as @xmath1-tagged jets , missing energy or leptons can target the models we consider while having very low sm backgrounds ( a similar point is made in the context of searching for heavy vector - like quarks in ref .",
    "since such searches look for a narrow resonance in the diphoton mass , the backgrounds can be directly determined from data and the observation of a peak near 125 gev would strongly suggest new physics involving production of an on - shell higgs .",
    "we find that in the @xmath11 tev lhc run the @xmath3 channel could give a strong signal in regions of parameter space where other searches are not sensitive , and that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels have sensitivity comparable to and in some regions exceeding that of existing susy searches .",
    "these results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : combinedlimits ] .",
    "although targeted @xmath14 searches have the best potential to probe our models , for sufficiently light squarks even inclusive searches for the sm higgs boson in the resonant @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels can have some sensitivity .",
    "enhancements of 20 - 50% over the sm rates can be accommodated within current bounds from other searches .",
    "searches in non - resonant channels , such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , generally include additional cuts that tend to reject susy events for the models we consider , so no excess rate is predicted for these analyses .",
    "our models therefore predict a very particular pattern of excesses in certain higgs searches which can be observable with sufficient data .",
    "such excesses can be consistent with the currently observed rates in the atlas and cms higgs searches , which report a higher than expected rate in the diphoton channels .",
    "we find that in the regions of parameter space where the excess rate in sm higgs searches is significant , strong signals are expected in the @xmath20 modes within the 8 tev run .",

    "in this section , we describe a set of models in which neutralino nlsps decay dominantly to the lsp and a higgs",
    ". an important consequence of this mechanism for higgs production is that if the lsp is light and the splitting between the nlsp and the higgs is not too large , the met signature in the susy cascade is suppressed .",
    "this can relax the collider constraints on superpartners , as we will discuss in detail for our model in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] and is explored for gluino and degenerate squark simplified models and the c(n)mssm in refs .",
    "in particular , this can allow for large colored production cross sections with only weak constraints from existing searches .    amongst the susy particles the squarks and gluinos typically have the largest production cross sections due to their color charge .",
    "if the squarks are degenerate in mass , existing susy searches strongly constrain their mass in the simplest @xmath22-parity conserving scenarios .",
    "squarks decaying directly to light neutralinos must be heavier than @xmath23tev  @xcite .",
    "these bounds are in tension with naturalness of the electroweak scale in susy , as if the stops are heavy then they give large corrections to the higgs masses that must be tuned away .",
    "it is possible however to recover susy naturalness if only the third generation squarks are light , with masses @xmath23 few hundred gev , with the other squarks much heavier so - called  natural spectra \"  @xcite . (",
    "some extension of the mssm is then necessary if the lightest higgs is to have a mass near 125 gev ; a number of possibilities have been explored  @xcite . )",
    "this scenario is much less constrained than the case of degenerate squarks since the third - generation squarks have smaller production cross sections and can produce less missing energy in their decays @xcite .",
    "combining these two elements , a natural squark spectrum and a neutralino nlsp decaying dominantly to the higgs , we find a set of models that evade constraints from existing searches but give large cross sections for higgs production , potentially giving striking signatures in searches exploiting the higgs resonance .",
    "the key features of these realistic models can be cast into a simplified model ( section  [ sec : simpmodel ] ) which will be our main focus for the rest of this work .",
    "if @xmath22-parity is conserved , the two - body decays of a neutralino nlsp to a neutral lsp can produce an on- or off - shell higgs , @xmath24 , or photon .",
    "in this section we describe some types of models in which a wino , bino , or higgsino nlsp decays dominantly to an on - shell higgs and a neutral lsp , making this channel a promising way to probe such a model at the lhc .",
    "_ states uncharged under the @xmath24 _ + at the renormalizable level , one simple scenario for obtaining large branching ratios of the nlsp to higgses is to have both the lsp and nlsp be formed mostly from states that do not couple to the @xmath24 or the photon ( i.e. states with @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is achieved in the mssm with a neutral wino - like nlsp and a bino - like lsp ( as studied in  @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath26 , the mixing of the nlsp and lsp with the higgsino is small .",
    "decays of the nlsp to the higgs are suppressed by one power of this mixing , while decays to the @xmath24 require mixing of both the nlsp and lsp states and are suppressed by two powers of the mixing .",
    "this is illustrated diagramatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixingfeyn ] . from an effective operator viewpoint ,",
    "integrating out the higgsinos generates the dimension five operator @xmath27 , while decays to the @xmath24 will arise only from the dimension six operator @xmath28 ( since the dimension five operator does not involve couplings to the neutral goldstone mode of the higgs ) and are therefore suppressed by additional powers of the higgsino mass .",
    "the dimension five operator @xmath29 can be generated by loops involving sfermions and allows decays to the photon or @xmath24 , but the loop factor suppression renders this negligible .",
    "[ fig : brwtoh ] shows the branching ratio of a 175 gev wino to a higgs and a nearly massless bino as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for a higgs mass of 125 gev in the decoupling limit .",
    "though large @xmath31 suppresses the wino decay to the higgs , it can be highly dominant even for relatively light higgsinos .",
    "in extensions of the mssm there can be additional states uncharged under the @xmath24 but with renormalizable couplings to the higgs and higgsinos .",
    "this can cause the nlsp to decay dominantly to the higgs by the same mechanism as above .",
    "examples include the singlino @xmath32 of the nmssm @xcite and string photini  @xcite",
    ". a singlino lsp mixes through the operator @xmath33 , and so unlike the bino has a decay width to the higgs that increases with large @xmath34 and is suppressed by low @xmath34 .",
    "string photini are superpartners of light @xmath35 gauge fields from string theory  @xcite , which can have small mixings with the bino . a string photino lsp therefore couples to the higgs exactly as the bino does but with a coupling suppressed by the wino - photino mixing @xmath36 .",
    "a similar enhancement of the higgs branching ratio can also occur for decays of a wino or bino nlsp to the goldstino of an @xmath22-symmetric susy breaking sector @xcite .",
    "since the lsp can be weakly coupled to the mssm fields in these scenarios , we will consider the limit in which all of the other mssm fields decay promptly to the bino or neutral / charged winos , which then decay to the lsp .",
    "we restrict our attention to the case where the decay to the lsp is not displaced on detector scales ( @xmath37 ) , ensuring accurate reconstruction of collider events and avoiding constraints from searches for metastable particles .",
    "_ higgsino nlsp and gravitino lsp _ + another scenario for obtaining large nlsp branching ratios to the higgs can occur for a higgsino - like nlsp decaying promptly to a gravitino lsp in models with low - scale susy breaking .",

    "if @xmath38 , then as @xmath31 approaches unity the coupling of the lightest higgsino to the @xmath24 approaches zero  @xcite , due to cancellation of the contributions from the @xmath39 and @xmath40 components .",

    "the decay of the charginos to the nlsp is then extremely suppressed ; if this is the dominant decay mode then the charginos have a macroscopic decay length .",
    "we instead consider the case where the chargino decays promptly to the lsp , e.g. @xmath44 . in this scenario",
    "not all susy decays will proceed through the true nlsp ( the neutral wino ) and produce a higgs . c.   * quasi - degenerate charginos * two types of models can give the spectrum and decays shown in fig .",

    "we will consider the minimal case where the splitting between these states and the nlsp is @xmath45 , so that they decay promptly to nlsp but the extra objects produce in the decay are soft and do not contribute significantly to collider signals .",
    "for a higgsino - like nlsp at @xmath46 gev , this is achieved with @xmath47 .",
    "because the gravitino is very weakly coupled , the other higgsinos will always decay to the nlsp .",
    "+ a second source for this spectrum are models where @xmath48 so that the wino and bino are significantly mixed , while the lsp is an additional state such as a singlino or string photino .",
    "the spectrum then includes a chargino and heavier wino - bino state in addition to the mixed wino - bino nlsp . the splitting between these heavier states and",
    "the nlsp can be large enough to allow prompt decays to the latter ( unlike the pure wino case ) . while the wino - bino mixing is suppressed at the larger values of @xmath30 required for the higgs decay to dominate , sufficient mixing",

    "both cms and atlas define dijet - tagged event classes , selecting jets widely separated in pseudorapidity @xmath257 to obtain sensitivity to vbf higgs production in the sm .",
    "the additional jets present in bsm events from our simplified model rarely satisfy this @xmath258 requirement , and the enhancement relative to the sm rate is at most a few percent in the parameter range we consider .    to summarize , if the simplified model of excess higgs production we have considered gives an observable enhancement to inclusive @xmath178 rate , then this is consistent with the lack of observed excesses in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath259 , but is in slight tension with an observed rate for @xmath260 which is consistent with the sm and does not explain the excess in the dijet - tagged @xmath179 channel .",
    "therefore , while the enhancement to the inclusive diphoton channel is encouraging , the simplified model alone likely does not give a significantly better fit to current data than does the sm prediction .",
    "thus far we have always assumed that the effective couplings of the higgs are the same as those predicted by the standard model .",
    "however , the light third generation squarks of our models can modify the higgs couplings to gluons and photons through loop effects , particularly if there are light stops ( discussed recently in refs .",
    "large stop mixing ( e.g. from @xmath261-terms ) is required to give the correct sign to enhance the diphoton branching ratios , and extremely large mixing is required to actually enhance the total diphoton rate from gluon fusion higgs production since the @xmath262 rate is at first suppressed as the diphoton branching ratio is enhanced  @xcite . by contributing another production mode which is not sensitive to the @xmath262 coupling , higgs production in cascade decays allows an overall enhancement to the diphoton rate at smaller mixings .",
    "the modified @xmath178 branching ratio then also enhances the dijet - tagged diphoton rate to reproduce the observed excess , while the reduced @xmath262 rate prevents an excess in the @xmath263 channel .",
    "we do not attempt a detailed fit to the data , but rather note that in the range of squark masses where these models can give significant enhancements to inclusive sm higgs searches , it is likely that excesses in the @xmath12 search and susy searches discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : ggb ] . as a general point ,",
    "excess higgs production in bsm cascades , possibly with less dramatic exclusive signatures than in our models , is an interesting degree of freedom to consider when fitting rates in higgs searches , giving qualitatively different effects from modifications to higgs couplings .",
    "we also note that to improve sensitivity , both atlas and cms divide the inclusive diphoton search into several event classes based on the kinematics of the photon and the quality of its reconstruction .",
    "our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : gg ] based on the inclusive diphoton count therefore only give an approximation of expected best fit rates , which in refs .",
    "@xcite are actually determined with a fit taking into account the different signal and background expectations in the individual event classes .",
    "of particular note , both atlas and cms have event classes capturing higgs production with higher transverse momentum , which has a smaller background rate . for example",
    ", atlas separates diphoton candidates into high and low @xmath264 event classes , where @xmath264 is the component of the diphoton momentum transverse to the thrust axis  @xcite .",
    "the simplified model higgs production leads to a substantially larger signal enhancement in the high @xmath264 category compared to sm @xmath262 events . for a given enhancement to the inclusive rate relative to the sm ,",
    "the expected enhancement in the high @xmath264 categories relative to the sm rate in these channels is generally @xmath265 times greater . in the combined 7 + 8",
    "tev results these channel show roughly equal enhancements compared to the sm rate , but with large enough individual uncertainty to accommodate a substantially higher rate in the high @xmath264 channels .",
    "while other exclusive diphoton channels are more sensitive to our specific model , with more statistics this could be a useful constraint on more general possibilities for enhancing higgs production through bsm cascades .",
    "if the nlsp in our models is a sufficiently light wino or higgsino , then the electroweak direct pair production rates can be large compared to sm associated higgs production rates .",
    "this can mildly constrain the neutralino / chargino spectra possible for the colored production case , and can also enhance the signal in diphoton searches . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : chitohiggs ] , we consider the possibilities of wino co - nlsps with small splittings such that the charginos decay promptly to the lsp , and a mixed wino - bino or higgsino nlsp , with the nearby neutralinos and charginos decaying promptly to the nlsp",

    "the discovery potential for heavier charginos and neutralinos in the @xmath125 mode at the 8 and 14 tev lhc has been studied in refs .",
    "however for a lighter nlsp with small splitting with the higgs , the met signature is suppressed and the resulting signals become much more similar to sm associated higgs production . because the production cross section can be many times larger than the sm rate and there is no additional activity in the event ( unlike in the colored production case ) , all of the existing searches for sm - like @xmath125 associated production will directly constrain the @xmath277 production cross section , which is shown relative to the sm @xmath125 cross section at 8 tev in fig .",

    "we focus instead on the case where the @xmath126 mode is dominant , which in the higgsino case at low masses requires @xmath287 .",

    "[ fig : directdiphoton ] for the two wino nlsp possibilities assuming @xmath135 branching fractions for the nlsp to the higgs , and for a higgsino nlsp decaying to a gravitino lsp at @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "only the mixed wino - bino nlsp with prompt decays of the charginos to the nlsp has a potentially interesting signal in these channels , due to its large production cross section compared to a higgsino nlsp and the potential to produce two higgses in each event , unlike the wino co - nlsp scenario .",
    "for masses lighter than 150 gev it can have a signal of 20 - 30% the sm rate in the inclusive @xmath210 channel and can be potentially observed in the @xmath295 channel in 20@xmath130 .",
    "the rate in the @xmath3 channel is too low to afford sensitivity .",
    "the @xmath12 search is just barely sensitive enough to excludes masses around @xmath296 in 20@xmath130 , but for lower masses the met signal is too suppressed .",
    "again , the rate in a lower met bin can be several times higher and may increase the sensitivity for a lighter wino .",
    "although the rates for the other nlsp scenarios are too small to be observable from just direct production , in the context of the simplified squark production model the additional contribution from direct production can slightly enhance the overall sensitivity of the diphoton channels .",
    "we have shown that in a variety of models the decays of a neutralino nlsp can give copious extra higgs boson production while remaining consistent with constraints from bsm searches .",
    "this leads to potentially observable signatures in higgs resonance searches .",
    "well - motivated realizations of this scenario include wino- and bino - like nlsps with a singlino / goldstino / string photino lsp , or a higgsino - like nlsp with a gravitino lsp .",
    "we have focused on pair production of light third generation squarks , motivated by naturalness of the electroweak scale .",
    "a wide class of realistic models can be well described by the simplified model of fig .",
    "[ fig : simpmodel ] , leading to final states with two bottom quarks , two higgses , and missing energy .",
    "existing searches constrain these models to have squark masses @xmath297 and nlsp masses @xmath298 , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : combinedlimits ] . for light squarks",
    "we argue that the most effective search strategy to probe these models is to target the @xmath179 decay mode , which would give a clear signal of a higgs resonance .",
    "a search in @xmath299 final states would have high signal efficiency and very low sm background , and could give high signal significance in 8 tev lhc data for squarks up to @xmath68 ( figure  [ fig:2bdiscovery ] ) .",
    "although a @xmath299 search is expected to be the best probe for the models we consider , even existing analyses can have some sensitivity with further 8 tev data .",
    "of particular interest is the possibility that the bsm production rate is high enough to account for the high signal strength reported by atlas and cms in the inclusive diphoton channels .",
    "this would require squarks near the limits placed by susy searches ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gginclusive ] ) . some excess",
    "are then expected for these searches in 8 tev data , though this would be difficult to link to higgs physics .",
    "more informative would be the searches for associated higgs production , namely the @xmath300 and @xmath301 analyses , which would all have rates well in excess of the standard model prediction . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : othersearch ] , little or no enhancement is expected in most searches in other higgs decay modes such as @xmath109 or @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , observing excesses in only the diphoton channels and particularly the associated production channels would suggest our class of models . in the parameter space where observable excesses can occur in these channels , a search in @xmath299",
    "can likely give a @xmath4 discovery in 20@xmath130 .",
    "although we have focused on a particular susy simplified model in this work , similar phenomenology can arise in many other models .",
    "final states very similar to those in our simplified model can arise for example from decays of new vector - like quarks to a higgs and third generation quarks , especially in the decays of bottom - like quarks , e.g. @xmath302 .",
    "more generally , much of what we have said is relevant for pair production of any new particles that decay dominantly to higgses .",
    "the diphoton decay mode still offers an excellent opportunity for identifying the higgs resonance , and a @xmath303 search can still have good efficiency because of the large higgs branching ratio to @xmath304 .",
    "finally , while this work has explored one well motivated scenario in which non - standard higgs channels can become sensitive , we emphasize the importance of searching for higgs production in as many channels as possible .",
    "abandoning all theoretical prejudice , little is currently known about the production and decay of the newly observed resonance at 125 gev , and there remains open the possibility of observing significant departures from standard model expectations in the very near future .",
