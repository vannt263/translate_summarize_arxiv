    "understanding the nature of qcd matter at high temperatures and densities means understanding the relevant degrees of freedom and their interaction .",
    "immense efforts have been invested both in theory and in experiment in order to study the transport properties of strongly interacting matter , which can be described by certain transport coefficients .",
    "they determine the evolution and relaxation of conserved charge densities within dynamical systems . shear",
    "( @xmath0 ) and bulk ( @xmath1 ) viscosities , for example , describe the hydrodynamic response of a medium to energy and momentum density fluctuations .",
    "a firm knowledge of these transport coefficients would have a wide range of implications in cosmology , astrophysics and in nuclear physics .",
    "measurements at rhic and lhc revealed that the matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions behaves like an almost perfect fluid , cf .  e.g.  the reviews in  @xcite . indeed , the measured flow pattern is best described by assuming only small dissipative effects with a specific shear viscosity @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the entropy density in the system ) of at most a few times the conjectured lower ( kss-)bound  @xcite @xmath4 which is based on holographic principles .    another outstanding observation made in central collisions of relativistic heavy nuclei",
    "is that final state hadrons are strongly suppressed at large transverse momenta  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon of jet quenching indicates that the produced matter is opaque , i.e.  that coloured charges suffer from a sizeable energy loss while traversing the medium  @xcite .",
    "an important transport coefficient in the context of energy loss is the jet quenching parameter  @xcite @xmath5 defined as the average squared transverse momentum transfer to a highly energetic particle per unit length due to multiple elastic scatterings with medium constituents .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 , thus , governs the transverse momentum broadening of propagating colour charges per unit length  @xcite .",
    "the probability for the formation of gluon bremsstrahlung depends sensitively on the efficiency by which a bremsstrahlung gluon decoheres from its emitter . as random scatterings with medium constituents",
    "accelerate this process , also the radiative energy loss of partons in the multiple scattering regime is governed by @xmath5 .",
    "an intriguing question is whether different transport coefficients are fundamentally related with each other . in this work",
    ", we study the possible connection between @xmath0 and @xmath5 within a quasiparticle approach , focussing on the case of pure hot , deconfined gluonic matter .",
    "in particular , the influence of a temperature dependent quasiparticle dispersion relation is investigated .",
    "in  @xcite it was demonstrated that @xmath0 and @xmath5 are formally connected , when one assumes ( i ) that the strongly interacting medium is effectively describable within a partonic quasiparticle framework and ( ii ) that the interaction between an energetic parton and the partonic quasiparticles is of the same structure and strength as the interaction among the medium constituents . in this case , one finds the relation  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the quasiparticle density in the thermal medium with temperature @xmath8 , @xmath9 the average quasiparticle momentum and @xmath10 the average center - of - mass energy squared in soft , elastic quasiparticle scatterings .",
    "when , in particular , a thermal ensemble of free massless bosons is considered , eq .",
    "( [ equ : relagen ] ) becomes @xmath11 according to  @xcite , this relation is generally true for any weakly coupled partonic quasiparticle system , while for a strongly coupled system @xmath12 is conjectured . in the following",
    ", we will investigate the relation eq .",
    "( [ equ : relagen ] ) within a phenomenological quasiparticle model ( qpm )  @xcite , in which gluonic quasiparticles obey a temperature dependent dispersion relation .",
    "in quantum field theories , transport coefficients such as the shear or bulk viscosity can be calculated within the framework of linear response theory from kubo - relations  @xcite . likewise , kinetic theory , e.g.  in the form of a linearized boltzmann equation , can be applied as a rigorous tool for evaluating the transport properties of systems with weak interaction strength  @xcite . here , the underlying assumption is that the dynamics of the system is describable in terms of weakly interacting quasiparticle excitations .",
    "such a picture leads to a lower bound in @xmath2 as consequence of the uncertainty principle , cf .",
    "@xcite .    by extrapolating perturbative qcd results for @xmath2  @xcite towards the confinement - deconfinement transition temperature",
    "@xmath13  @xcite one can not explain the small values deduced from experiment .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily imply that any picture based on quasiparticle excitations is inadequate for describing the properties of the produced matter . within the qpm  @xcite , based on an effective kinetic theory approach of boltzmann - vlasov type",
    ", the shear and bulk viscosities have been determined in  @xcite for the pure gluon plasma in relaxation time approximation and their ratio was studied in  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the medium is viewed as being composed of quasigluons with the same quantum numbers and obeying the same quantum statistics as partonic gluons .",
    "they follow , however , a medium - modified dispersion relation featuring a temperature - dependent gluon mass which accommodates non - perturbative effects in the vicinity of @xmath13 , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a fairly good quantitative agreement with the available lattice qcd results  @xcite was obtained  @xcite .",
    "both , specific shear and bulk viscosities , were found to exhibit a pronounced behaviour . at high @xmath8",
    ", @xmath2 is large and shows the parametric dependencies known from perturbative qcd  @xcite , while it has a minimum near @xmath13 . in contrast , @xmath14 is found to become large near @xmath13 , similar to  @xcite , while it vanishes logarithmically with increasing temperature .",

    "such a behaviour could have a strong impact on related observables .",
