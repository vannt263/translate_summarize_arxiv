    "optics was the original handle by which classical physicists learned to pry their way into the mysteries of quantum physics .",
    "this was appropriate because optics possesses a dual character , in one limit the purely classical wave theory , and in the other the purely quantum mechanical particle limit . in 1900 , when the spectrum of black body radiation was being studied in detail , only the classical side was known .",
    "this was used to connect it with thermodynamics , from which many of its properties could be derived .",
    "but the wien spectral law , which characterized the general , but not specific form of the spectral law , was as far as thermodynamics could take one .    in order to get a specific law , planck had to also draw on the probabilistic considerations of boltzmann , a real departure for planck , and he inadvertently drew into focus the particle aspect of the problem , without at that time understanding just how radical his innovation was . but this added statistics and fluctuations into the mix . a main point in this paper",
    "will be to show the role that fluctuations played in planck s and einstein s thinking in the early days of quantum theory , the important role it played in the development of the quantum theory of the laser , and finally , how the laser theory allows one to treat the fluctuations in a bose - einstein gas , both above and below the critical temperature",
    ".    a second major theme in the paper will be to pursue the historical thread running through planck s work . in their desire to present a coherent story , leading from classical physics to quantum physics , most textbooks leave out or distort the history of the subject , which is consequently not well known . but in this case , the courage of planck in abandoning his lifelong distrust of probability , coupled with his total reluctance to abandon the principles of classical physics , led to a series of fascinating ironies that strongly affected the history of the subject , and they deserve to be better known .    a further hidden element guiding the development of the early quantum theory , the laser , and bose - einstein condensation , was the connection between advancing technology and experimental technique .",
    "the effects of technology are apparent in the laser and bose - einstein condensation , although they are usually not appreciated as an input into early quantum theory , but the accurate measurements of the black body spectra were made possible by the invention of the bolometer by langley , who became the first director of the smithsonian institution in america . but also , the funding for the improvements of the bolometer so that measurements could be extended into the infrared , which became the most relevant measurements , leading to the breakdown of wien s specific radiation law , was provided by the power company of berlin , which city had recently been electrified .",
    "black body radiation is the least efficient means of illumination ( one wants to be far from equilibrium ) and it set a standard against which to measure efficiencies .",
    "so it turns out that the interest in funding such an abstruse subject as black body radiation was actually driven by the technology of the day .",
    "the interconnections between all these threads forms an interesting subject in itself , but here we shall only go so far as to follow a few of them .",
    "we shall emphasize some of the interesting historical details that surround planck s work , which seem to be almost unknown to physicists .",
    "we have drawn heavily on planck s original papers , [ planck ( 1900 a , b ) ] , reproduced with comments in [ ter haar ( 1967 ) ] , and planck s book on heat radiation [ planck ( 1913 ) ] .",
    "we have also extensively used [ kuhn ( 1978 ) ] , [ hermann ( 1971 ) ] , [ jammer ( 1966 ) ] , and [ heilbron ( 1996 ) ] . some other good references are [ klein ( 1975 ) ] , [ mehra and rechenberg ( 1982 ) ] , [ rosenfeld ( 1936 ) ] , [ varro ( 2006 ) ] , and [ kangro ( 1976 ) ] . an anthology that contains reprints of some papers we refer to , with comments , is [ brush ( 2003 ) ] .",
    "we go on to describe in some detail exactly what planck did , and did not do , and the importance of fluctuations in his work .",
    "their true meaning and importance was established by einstein [ einstein ( 1909 ) ] .",
    "we then describe how fluctuations enter into the theory of the laser , and how this theory has been used to treat fluctuations in bose - einstein condensation .",
    "it is rather universally assumed that when planck introduced the quantum in 1900 , [ planck ( 1900a ) , planck ( 1900b ) ] he quantized the energy levels of an oscillator .",
    "but in fact , what he did was very ambiguous [ kuhn ( 1978 ) ] , and we shall produce some strong evidence that at that time he was thinking more along the lines of quantizing the size of cells in phase space .",
    "furthermore , he fought the idea of quantizing both radiation and the oscillator .",
    "in fact , as late as 1913 , when he published the second edition of his book on heat radiation [ planck ( 1913 ) ] , he did not believe that the energy levels of either the oscillator or the radiation were quantized , even though einstein had quantized both of them , the photon in 1905 , [ einstein ( 1905 ) ] and the oscillator in 1907 [ einstein 1907 ] . we shall introduce a number of quotes from planck s original theoretical paper on quantum theory [ planck ( 1900b ) ] which is usually taken as the birth of quantum theory , and from his heat radiation book , to prove his aversion to quantizing anything physical .",
    "it was not until bohr had quantized the levels of the hydrogen atom [ bohr ( 1913 ) ] , and the discussions that followed this , that planck and most of his colleagues accepted quantization as a fact of nature .",
    "it is well known that planck rejected the idea of photons until quite late , but here is a quote from the introduction of his 1913 book that not only proves that , but that also outlines his philosophy on the subject , which we think not only explains his opinions , but also made it possible for him to discover the law of black body radiation long before either he or anyone else understood its consequences .",
    "he says ,  while many physicists , through conservatism , reject the ideas developed by me , or at any rate maintain an expectant attitude , a few authors have attacked them for the opposite reason , namely , as being inadequate , and have felt compelled to supplement them by assumptions of a still more radical nature , for example , by the assumption that any radiant energy whatever , even though it travel freely in a vacuum , consists of indivisible quanta , or cells .",
    "since nothing probably is a greater drawback to the successful development of a new hypothesis than overstepping its boundaries , i have always stood for making as close a connection between the hypothesis of quanta and the classical dynamics as possible , and for not stepping outside of the boundaries of the latter until the experimental facts leave no other course open .",
    "i have attempted to keep to this standpoint in the revision of this treatise necessary for a new edition . \"",
    "obviously he is referring disapprovingly to einstein s photons in the quote .",
    "however we shall see that the last part of the quote is also very relevant in deciding what he actually did .",
    "what then led to the radically new form of the radiation law ?",
    "it was the breaking up of the energy cells into finite units , so that statistics could be applied , which as he said he took directly from boltzmann [ boltzmann ( 1877 ) ] ( who ultimately let the cell size go to zero ) , and his introduction of a new way of counting microstates .",
    "we point out that the introduction of the quantum alone was not enough to produce his formula .",
    "this is because when one uses boltzmann statistics , if one changes the cell size , one merely changes the thermodynamic probability by an exponential multiplicative factor , which in turn leads to an additive constant in the entropy .",
    "since in classical entropy , an additive constant has no physical significance , this is why the cell size does nt matter in classical physics .",
    "planck s argument , which led to a counting scheme that looks very like bose statistics , introduced a cell size that is unique , and in fact is a fundamental constant of nature , and this was caused by his taking the entities that occupied these quantized units as indistinguishable .",
    "he was silent on this matter , and it took a long time for people to realize it .    the first inkling of what was happening came from two papers in 1911 , one by natanson [ natanson ( 1911 ) ] , and the other by ehrenfest ( 1911 ) ] .",
    "they both singled out einstein s derivation of the localized photon - like properties of electromagnetic waves [ einstein ( 1905 ) ] in the limit where wien s radiation formula worked ( einstein took wien s formula as his starting point ) .",
    "they pointed out that his argument would not work with planck s formula instead of wien s and that einstein s argument presumes boltzmann statistics .",
    "they then point out that planck s argument assumes that the energy units are indistinguishable , which they each find very puzzling .",
    "( of course with hindsight , we realize that wien s formula holds in the particle - like domain where einstein was operating , while the rayleigh - jeans formula holds in the wave - like regime .",
    "einstein s later 1909 paper on fluctuations [ einstein ( 1909 ) ] sets out the particle - wave dichotomy for photons for the first time . )",
    "before we begin , we would like to point out that there were many historical ironies in planck s development .",
    "his thesis advisor ( 1879 ) , phillip von jolly , told him that the development of the first and second laws of thermodynamics had completed the structure of theoretical physics and that a bright young man should think twice about entering the field [ quoted by heilbron ( 1996 ) ] .",
    "( this in spite of the fact that maxwell s equations had been developed only ten years earlier .",
    "but it is known that einstein in 1900 could nt find a course on electrodynamics at zurich , and had to teach himself .",
    "new advances percolated at a slow rate in those days . )",
    "planck nonetheless thought that there was a lot left to do regarding entropy , and spent most of his early career developing the consequences of the second law , namely in chemical thermodynamics .",
    "this led to a call to berlin in 1889 for him to replace kirchoff , who had retired ( but planck was not initially appointed as a full professor ) .",
    "he soon complained in a letter that  nobody in berlin is interested in entropy \" [ heilbron ( 1996 ) ] .",
    "but when he started working on black body radiation , he immediately looked for the connection between entropy and energy , while he said everyone else was looking for the connection between frequency and temperature .",
    "although he was initially under the influence of ostwald and mach ( the great disbelievers in atomic theory , since atoms were then considered unobservable ) , planck had slowly come to believe in atoms , as he thought it was the only way to treat certain problems , such as heat conduction and osmotic pressure , but he was sure that they were to be treated by mechanics .",
    "he was bitterly against the probability arguments of boltzmann , whom he otherwise respected , because he thought the second law had to be exact .",
    "in fact he set an assistant , zermelo ( later of axiomatic set theory fame ) , to develop one of the two main arguments against boltzmann , the  ergodic \" argument [ zermelo ( 1896a , b ) , boltzmann ( 1896a , b ) ] , that a system in phase space will ultimately return to a point arbitrarily close to where it is now , even if far from equilibrium .",
    "( the other argument , due to loschmidt , was the  time reversal \" argument [ boltzmann ( 1877b ) ] , that for every state heading toward equilibrium , there is another time - reversed state heading away from it ) .",
    "he started to work on the black body radiation problem in 1896 , and he thought [ planck ( 1900c ) ] he had proven wien s empirical radiation law ( an exponential form , which actually holds only at relatively low temperatures , or high @xmath0 ) . by 1900 ,",
    "experiments were being carried out at higher temperatures and lower , infra - red frequencies , and the experimentalists , lummer and pringsheim , and planck s colleagues , rubens and kurlbaum , were finding out that wien s law did not work .",
    "the energy at a given frequency at higher temperatures was becoming linear in the temperature ( in accord with the not - yet - stated rayleigh - jeans law ) .",
    "planck developed his radiation law in a somewhat ad - hoc manner , which law worked very well , and he then set about to develop a theoretical explanation .",
    "at that time , there were a number of proposed hypothetical laws to deal with the discrepancy being discovered in wien s law .",
    "planck s worked almost perfectly , and was quickly accepted by the experimentalists .",
    "but it was clear that for any law to be taken seriously , it had to be theoretically motivated .",
    "planck had become convinced that one could never discover the universal energy function by purely thermodynamic means , and he reluctantly decided to switch to boltzmann s methods . in a later famous letter that planck wrote about the success of that effort , [ letter to r. w. wood , quoted in hermann ( 1971 ) ] , he said that switching to probability arguments was  an act of desperation \" , but that breaking the cell into units of @xmath1 was  purely a formal assumption and i really did not give it much thought \" ( since the dependence on @xmath2 is actually required by wien s spectral law , a direct consequence of the second law ) .    in order to apply the probability theory , planck wrote @xmath3 , to connect the thermodynamic probability @xmath4 with the entropy @xmath5 . in doing so , he wrote this equation for the first time , as boltzmann , on whose tombstone the equation appears , never actually wrote it .",
    "boltzmann always used the _",
    "h_-theorem , or something equivalent .",
    "another related irony is that boltzmann never wrote @xmath6 as a separate constant , but always used ( @xmath7 ) , the gas - constant per molecule .",
    "planck s radiation law allowed one to calculate @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 accurately for the first time , as well as the electrical charge e , from the faraday constant . as a result ,",
    "planck thought it only simple justice that @xmath6 should be called planck s constant , or at least the planck - boltzmann constant , but it never happened .",
    "the poor fellow was stuck with @xmath8 !    in 1908 , arrhenius ( who wielded tremendous influence ) tried to convince the swedish academy [ quoted in heilbron ( 1996 ) ] to give planck the nobel prize because ",
    "it has been made extremely plausible that the view that matter consists of molecules and atoms is essentially correct ... no doubt this is the most important offspring of planck s magnificent work . \"",
    "no mention of the quantum of action .",
    "but planck had to wait another 10 years , because lorentz [ lorentz ( 1908 ) ] had come up with an argument that the rayleigh - jeans law had to be the correct classical law , and that the reason it failed at high temperature was that the system could not come to equilibrium at high temperatures .",
    "he withdrew this opinion after the experimentalists convinced him that if the rayleigh - jeans law were correct , with its ultraviolet catastrophe , many substances would glow in the dark at room temperature .",
    "but the academy decided that the jury was still out on planck s work .",
    "an even further irony is that planck was ultimately convinced of the truth of the new quantum theory by nernst s heat theorem , that @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , with no additive constant , so that there is an absolute minimum entropy reached at absolute zero .",
    "this is a purely probabilistic argument , so far had planck gone in changing his view .",
    "the ultimate irony is that when boltzmann committed suicide , from sickness and frustration with all his critics , the university of vienna offered planck his chair .",
    "( planck , who loved vienna and was a professional quality pianist , was tempted .",
    "but his colleagues at berlin managed to make it worthwhile for him to stay . )",
    "planck [ planck ( 1913 ) ] praises einstein s derivation of @xmath14 , but he never mentions his quantization of the energy levels of the oscillator to @xmath15 , or uses it .",
    "he merely says it is beyond the scope of his book , but it strikes us as rather strange that he chose not to further comment on it , as it seems to disagree with planck s interpretation .",
    "the concept of a black body was introduced by kirchoff in 1860 [ kirchoff ( 1860 ) ] . in",
    "what follows , including planck s law , we are going to give a rather self - contained argument that will not always be historically complete , although we will indicate certain occasions where historic remarks are relevant , because they determine motivations , and provide a context for what people did .",
    "we note that the history is often fairly complicated , controversies arose and sometimes took many years to get resolved .",
    "sometimes it is even true that no one knew precisely what had been accomplished until much later .",
    "( as an example , we note that the  ultraviolet catastrophe \" was not even named as such [ ehrenfest 1911 ] until 11 years after planck had solved the problem ! ) we are not professional historians , but at least in the case of planck , there are many  smoking guns \" within his work to justify what we say .",
    "kirchoff knew from looking at spectral lines from the sun that there was heat energy in empty space , and postulated equilibrium radiation .",
    "but the knowledge of what it consisted of was primitive .",
    "maxwell s equations had not yet been postulated , and the identity of heat rays and light rays had not yet been established . nor had the existence of atoms in the walls of a cavity , nor that an oscillator radiates and absorbs electromagnetic energy , or that such energy carries momentum . thus it is rather amazing that kirchoff should have established on the basis of relatively simple arguments that within a cavity at equilibrium , this radiation should be independent of the substance of the walls of the cavity , and that at a fixed temperature a good emitter of radiation should be a good absorber . a perfect absorber should then radiate an energy equivalent to everything that falls upon it within the cavity at equilibrium , independently at each frequency .",
    "the radiation emitted by such a perfect absorber he called black radiation , and there should then be a universal function @xmath16 that describes the radiation density in equilibrium with the walls , that on average gets both absorbed and reemitted , at any particular frequency and temperature .",
    "because of the unknown nature of what happened within the cavity , kirchoff was attacked for each of the assumptions he made leading to this conclusion , and the existence of this universal function was dismissed by many .",
    "meanwhile others tried to change the assumptions and re - derive the results .",
    "even after the turn of the century this argument went on ( well after planck s work ) .",
    "although planck does not explicitly mention these controversies in the 1913 edition of his book on heat radiation , he was nonetheless clearly affected by them , as he takes over 20 pages to discuss and justify kirchoff s law .",
    "however , after maxwell , boltzmann tried to find a thermodynamic  equation of state \" for the radiation in 1884 ( similar to @xmath17 for particles ) [ boltzmann ( 1884 ) ] , and after hertz had produced electromagnetic waves in 1888 , wien tried in 1893 [ wien ( 1893 ) ] to find the spectral function of kirchoff .",
    "he succeeded to the extent of reducing the problem to a single function of @xmath0 , which is as far as one can go thermodynamically , and for which he ultimately won the nobel prize .",
    "since the radiation hitting an area a of the wall of a cavity carries both momentum density and energy density , boltzmann was able to treat it similarly to a particle flux hitting the wall , and showed that@xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 refer to the pressure and energy density between frequencies @xmath2 and ( @xmath2 + @xmath21 ) .",
    "the difference between this formula and the non - relativistic one is the factor 1/3 , rather than the 2/3 for particles , which comes from the non - relativistic form for the energy ( @xmath22 ) rather than the extreme relativistic form for light ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "boltzmann then used this in connection with the second law of thermodynamics@xmath24together with @xmath25 , to get@xmath26@xmath27    @xmath28    the stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "before boltzmann derived it theoretically , stefan had correctly guessed its form by examining some data that was not only inadequate , but that we now know was inaccurate as well .    for the entropy",
    ", we again use the equation ( [ g2.2 ] ) .",
    "if we define the entropy density @xmath29 as @xmath30 , then@xmath31    @xmath32    eq . ( [ g2.4 ] ) implies that during an adiabatic expansion of the cavity , so that the entropy is constant , we will have @xmath33      in 1888 hertz showed the reality of maxwell waves . in 1893",
    "wien applied the laws of thermodynamics and electromagnetism to the problem of black body radiation [ wien ( 1893 ) ] and succeeded in reducing kirchoff s universal function to a function of one variable .",
    "that is as far as one can go in classical physics .",
    "wien tackled the problem of including the frequency in the black body law by considering an adiabatic motion of a wall of the cavity .",
    "this induced a doppler shift on the radiation , while at the same time the wall did work on the radiation .",
    "born s atomic physics book [ born ( 1929 ) ] has a simplified treatment in an appendix .",
    "but we will consider a much simpler technique based on adiabatic invariance , that was not available to wien , but was first introduced by ehrenfest in 1913 [ ehrenfest ( 1913 ) ] .",
    "ehrenfest was looking for some quantity that would not change while the external parameters of the system undergo a slow adiabatic change .",
    "he reasoned that such a quantity would be a good candidate for quantization , since it would not undergo a gradual change during the process , but could only change abruptly .",
    "this became the theoretical underpinning for the bohr - sommerfeld - wilson quantization rule .",
    "first we have to find the normal modes of the radiation .",
    "we assume the cavity is a cube , of side l , since for all but the lowest normal modes the shape does not matter .",
    "we also assume that the walls are fully reflecting and use standing wave boundary conditions .",
    "then the modes for a fourier expansion of the field satisfy@xmath34the last of these equations comes from the wave equation for the fields . here",
    "the n s are positive integers .",
    "the number of modes in a region is given by@xmath35the @xmath36 in the denominator of the first line is due to the fact that the @xmath37 s are positive , so only the first octant is important , but we are integrating the @xmath38 s over all of @xmath38 space .",
    "finally we must introduce another factor of @xmath39 because there are two degrees of polarization for each direction in @xmath38 space .",
    "so@xmath40rayleigh introduced the counting of modes of the field [ rayleigh ( 1900 ) ] in 1900 .",
    "he did it only qualitatively , following an earlier procedure he had used for sound waves .",
    "he then said the total energy density should be@xmath41here represents the average energy of a mode , which by the equipartition theorem should be @xmath42 . in 1905",
    "he added the numerical factors in the above equation [ rayleigh ( 1905 ) ] , but made a minor mistake which was corrected by jeans [ jeans ( 1905 ) ] , who emphasized how important and inescapable the above formula is .",
    "it has since been known as the rayleigh - jeans law .",
    "later lorentz also gave a very general derivation [ lorentz ( 1908 ) ] , and for a while he and jeans believed that the reason the equation did not work experimentally was because it was difficult to establish equilibrium at high frequencies , and the experiments were therefore not correct .",
    "but the equation blows up at high frequencies and so can not be correct , a problem labeled by ehrenfest as the  ultraviolet catastrophe \" in 1911 [ ehrenfest ( 1911 ) ] .    to establish wien s law ,",
    "one need only note that in eq .",
    "( [ g2.5 ] ) , if one slowly changes @xmath43 , then @xmath44 will slowly change , but @xmath45 can not and will stay fixed [ ter haar ( 1967 ) ] .",
    "this leads to@xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48the second line above is just eq .",
    "( [ g2.4 ] ) , and so since the entropy of each node , @xmath49 , remains constant during an adiabatic change , one must have@xmath50and therefore@xmath51the rayleigh - jeans law obviously takes this form , and so does an empirical radiation law proposed by wien , [ wien ( 1996)]@xmath52(we call this wien s radiation law , to differentiate it from eq .",
    "( [ g2.11 ] ) , wien s spectral law , firmly embedded in the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "( [ g2.11 ] ) is sometimes called wien s displacement law , but we reserve this for the statement concerning the frequency where the energy distribution @xmath20 is a maximum , @xmath53/t = const , a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ g2.11 ] ) . )",
    "prior to 1900 , all measurements were taken in the relatively high frequency domain , and wien s empirical law held pretty well . in fact , planck had convinced himself that it must be the universal law .",
    "but the situation started changing after improvements were made to the experimental equipment .",
    "then rubens reported to planck that at higher temperature for a given frequency the results were becoming linear in t , and planck realized he had to rethink his ideas .      in his first theoretical paper in 1900 , planck [ planck ( 1900b ) ] makes two very confusing statements about the quantization of energy .",
    "he gives two successive sentences that are totally contradictory .",
    "after telling us that he will use boltzmann s method , he says ,  if @xmath54 [ the energy of the @xmath55 resonators of energy @xmath2 ] is considered to be a continuously divisible quantity , this distribution is possible in infinitely many ways .",
    "we consider , however - this is the most essential point of the whole calculation - @xmath54 to be composed of a very definite number of equal parts and use thereto the constant of nature @xmath57erg@xmath58sec .",
    "this constant multiplied by the common frequency @xmath2 of the resonators gives us the energy element @xmath59 in erg , and dividing @xmath60 by @xmath59 we get the number @xmath61 of energy elements which must be divided over the @xmath55 resonators . \"",
    "this statement is often quoted in history of quantum theory books and articles , and it certainly looks like planck is talking about quantized energy levels .",
    "however the very next sentence reads ,  if the ratio is not an integer , we take for @xmath61 an integer in the neighborhood .",
    "\" now if he really meant for the energy units to be quantized , @xmath61 would naturally be an integer .",
    "instead , we believe that he meant that the resonators could have any energy between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and one just lumped them all together as @xmath62 . in other words , he was quantizing in phase space , as boltzmann had done , because as he said , one could not count states otherwise .",
    "he went on to count and characterize the energy elements , @xmath59 , but he never said that an oscillator s total energy must be @xmath62 , as einstein later did .",
    "this is because , as we shall show below , he never believed it to be so .    in 1906 - 7 , planck gave a series of lectures in berlin , which were published as a rather comprehensive book on  heat radiation \" .",
    "he put out a second edition in 1913 , [ planck ( 1913 ) ] so the statements in the book should be indicative of how planck thought about the subject as late as 1913 .",
    "there is no doubt that he introduced a quantum of action .",
    "he says as much in opening the preface to the second edition ,  recent advances in physical research have , on the whole been favorable to the special theory outlined in this book , in particular to the hypothesis of an elementary quantity of action . \" but exactly what was quantized ?",
    "he says on p. 125 ,  by the preceding developments the calculation of the entropy of a system of n molecules in a given thermodynamic state is , in general , reduced to the single problem of finding the magnitude @xmath64 of the region elements in the state space .",
    "that such a definite finite quantity really exists is a characteristic feature of the theory we are developing , as contrasted with that due to boltzmann , and forms the content of the so - called hypothesis of quanta . \"",
    "it would seem fairly certain from this statement that his interest was in quantizing phase space . shortly thereafter , in part iii , chapter iii , p. 135",
    ", he introduces a model of the linear harmonic oscillator , specifically in phase space .",
    "he talks about the energy as an ellipse , and makes the transition from the coordinates @xmath65 and @xmath66 to @xmath54 and @xmath67 .",
    "he introduces the unit of action and takes the ellipses to have the average energy @xmath68 .",
    "he then makes an argument defending the appearance of what we now call  zero - point energy \" ( although his interpretation of it is totally different , having nothing to do with the uncertainty principle ) .",
    "it is hard to see why he would do that unless he thought the actual energies were distributed throughout the ellipse .    in part",
    "iv , chapter iii , he shows in more detail his ideas about the emission of radiation . to modern eyes ,",
    "this new theory of planck s looks very strange , as it makes absorption and emission totally different processes .",
    "but it was used by a number of people for a while , and it could explain the photoelectric effect , and a few other things , but it was forgotten relatively soon after bohr quantized the hydrogen atom later that year .",
    "( bohr s theory itself took some time to become accepted . ) but it shows how planck s thinking was totally in flux , and how even then he was unwilling to believe in the quantization of energy levels . on p. 161 , he says ,  whereas the absorption of radiation by an oscillator takes place in a perfectly continuous way , so that the energy of the oscillator increases continuously and at a constant rate , for the emission we have , in accordance with sec . 147 , the following law",
    ": the oscillator emits in irregular intervals , subject to the laws of chance ; it emits , however only at a moment when its energy of vibration is just equal to an integral multiple @xmath37 of the elementary quantum @xmath59 @xmath69 , and then it always emits its whole energy of vibration @xmath62 . \"",
    "he then describes how the oscillator absorbs energy at a constant rate , so that its energy increases linearly in time , and as it passes a given energy @xmath62 , it may or may not radiate .",
    "if not , it continues on toward @xmath63 .",
    "so the oscillator energy is not quantized , but it emits in quantized units , of multiples of the quanta .",

    "but it is clear that the energy levels of the oscillator are not quantized , nor is the absorption of radiation .",
    "only the emission of radiation is . presumably after emission ,",

    "he even draws a diagram giving the saw - toothed form described above for the energy of a single oscillator as a function of time .",
    "we would like to say something about planck s intellectual attitude , which was summarized in the quote we gave at the beginning .",
    "he was an insider , an intellectual leader of the german community , and a man of total integrity .",
    "he had not the slightest desire to overthrow , or to see the overthrow , of the hard - won victories of classical science . and yet in times of crisis , he had the moral courage both to introduce a notion that he knew was radical , and whose implications no one could comprehend at the time , and also to suddenly abandon a strong belief that had sustained him throughout his career until then , namely that statistical considerations could not play a fundamental role in the understanding of physics at a profound level .",
    "the quote shows clearly that he would willingly go as far as he thought he had to go , but absolutely no further , and he lived up to this conviction .",
    "for this reason , we believe that nobody but planck could have made the advance that he made , when he did .",
    "his first paper was a purely phenomenological gimmick , which he made by performing his analysis in terms of entropy .",
    "as he said , he had devoted his life to examining entropy , which few people at the time took seriously . in his second paper",
    "he realized that the gimmick of the first paper had to correspond to a fundamental finite unit of action .",
    "but what that meant , nobody was prepared to say at that time .",
    "his own explanations were fuzzy , arbitrary , and had many loopholes . we think his revelation took the subject as far as it could have gone without a deeper analysis , which after all would consume many years of work by many people . in the total state of ignorance at that time , we think he did exactly what he was mentally inclined to do .",
    "he took the subject as far as it could go at that time , and no further .",
    "he introduced the quantum of action , and it worked , but its significance was very obscure .",
    "however it is important to realize that quantized energy levels , for both radiation and matter , are features of nature .",
    "quantized cells in phase space are artifacts of theory .",
    "it is interesting that he was willing to accept the latter , which he could hope to fix , but was not willing for a long time to accept the former , which would invalidate most of classical physics .",
    "his conservatism led him for many years to try to find a close - to - classical explanation for what he had done , and he was strongly inclined against the radical advances of others , which is why it was left for einstein to quantize both the oscillator levels and the electromagnetic field . on the other hand , in subjects where radical ideas could immediately lead to clear conceptual advances , he was quick to approve , and he was one of the earliest supporters of relativity theory , and in fact spent most of his research time between 1905 and 1908 trying to advance the theory , and convince his peers of its validity .",
    "planck s position in the german physical society made his voice the primary one in deciding what should be published in _",
    "annalen der physik _",
    ", the leading physics journal of the time , and his openness to radical new ideas , such as einstein s , is almost without parallel ( one wonders whether a paper such as einstein s special relativity paper would get published in _ physical review _ today ? ) he even allowed einstein to publish his photon paper , with which he strongly disagreed .",
    "when planck attacked the problem of black body radiation , he realized that since the results were independent of the nature of the material in the cavity , one could use a simple model for the cavity .",

    "could he have not known about equipartition , since at this time he was an avid attacker of the entire statistical mechanics enterprise ? this would seem very unlikely , as he was interested in specific heats , and would have known about the dulong - petit law controversy [ dulong , petit ( 1819 ) ] ( some solids did and some did not have @xmath84 ) . or was he aware of it but already had no confidence in it , as wien s empirical law , eq .",

    "planck had derived a formula for the approach to equilibrium by an oscillator in a black body cavity that had a small excess energy @xmath85 over its equilibrium value [ planck ( 1900d ) ] .",
    "then if its energy changed by @xmath86 , the change in entropy of the entire system ( oscillator plus field ) would be@xmath87so the function @xmath88 is clearly connected to fluctuations about equilibrium , although at the time planck was not thinking statistically .",
    "it was einstein in 1909 [ einstein ( 1909 ) ] who clearly brought out the direct meaning of this function as a statistical measure of fluctuations .",

    "planck s first derivation of his radiation formula was a purely numerical manipulation .",
    "nonetheless , it is very interesting because it is profoundly and directly connected to fluctuations , in a way that planck could not have foreseen .",

    "planck says he spent the next few days looking for an extrapolation between these two extremes , that gave plausible behavior , and finally came up with@xmath108where @xmath109 is independent of the temperature . in the limit",
    "@xmath110@xmath111where @xmath8 is a new physical constant .",
    "the fact that @xmath109 must depend linearly on @xmath2 comes from wien s spectral theorem , a thermodynamic necessity . in the other limit , @xmath112 , we have eq . ( [ g2.22 ] ) , the rayleigh - jeans law .",

    "( g2.23 ) , to get planck s formula , which is still valid today,@xmath113@xmath114@xmath115      as we have said , planck imagined that there were a series of oscillators in the walls , in equilibrium with the radiation .",
    "since each oscillator reaches equilibrium with the same frequency of radiation as the oscillator itself , and those of different frequencies all behave independently , we can consider each frequency independently .",
    "this had previously given rise to much controversy , the problem being how independently behaving oscillators could ever come to equilibrium . especially if one considered the walls of the cavity to be perfectly reflecting .",
    "the prevailing opinion was that this was an abstraction , and if one thought of a small lump of coal ( that absorbed all frequencies ) as also being inside the cavity , it would force all frequencies to come to equilibrium together .",
    "next he considered that for each frequency , if there were @xmath55 oscillators , the total energy was divided into @xmath61 discrete units of size @xmath59 = @xmath1 .",

    "planck in any case was psychologically not disposed to seeing the energy as quantized , and as we have emphasized , long resisted it .",
    "if planck were to continue following boltzmann , he could further divide this into @xmath118 oscillators with energy @xmath119 so that@xmath120and then find the distribution of @xmath118 s which has maximum probability .",
    "but planck stated that one did nt even have to go this far .",
    "he merely said that most of the time the system will be very close to equilibrium , and the rest constitute rare events that will hardly contribute , so he just took the total number of possible ways to distribute the p units of energy over the n oscillators .",
    "how many such ways are there ?",
    "a simple way to see this ( due to ehrenfest ) is just to draw two vertical bars , and randomly distribute @xmath61 circles , and @xmath121 other bars between them .",
    "for example , the arrangement    @xmath122    would represent @xmath39 units of energy in the first box ( oscillator ) , none in the second , @xmath123 in the third , @xmath124 in the fourth , etc .",
    ", altogether taking up @xmath55 boxes .",
    "how many possible such arrangements are there ?",

    "if @xmath141 , we lose the behavior of wien s empirical formula at high energies , which is the limit in which einstein introduced the particle behavior of photons .",
    "rosenfeld , in writing a history of early quantum theory [ rosenfeld ( 1936 ) ] claimed that planck probably worked backward from eq .",

    "( [ g2.27 ] ) , which appears in boltzmann s original article , [ boltzmann ( 1877a ) ] .",
    "there are a number of things to notice about planck s derivation , some of which we have noted earlier .",
    "first , what does it mean to keep @xmath59 finite , since for the case of particles using classical statistics , cell size does nt matter ?",
    "we pointed out earlier that it was noticed independently by natanson and ehrenfest in 1911 that the planck derivation treats all the energy elements as equivalent , so that it is clearly different from boltzmann s statistics , and in fact makes them indistinguishable .",
    "ehrenfest also showed in 1906 [ ehrenfest ( 1906 ) ] that the planck derivation puts an extra constraint on the system that he said could be satisfied in several ways , but that the most natural was to strictly quantize the energy levels of the oscillators .",
    "einstein actually did this [ einstein ( 1907 ) ] in 1907 , in his famous specific heat paper .",
    "a number of people noticed that since @xmath59 = @xmath1 , one of the basic assumptions of the theory can not work .",
    "( [ g2.29 ] ) and ( g2.31 ) assume that @xmath55 and @xmath142 but for high enough frequencies at a given temperature , @xmath59 becomes quite large , and most of the oscillators will be in their ground state .",
    "this is why equipartition breaks down , since classical physics scales the frequency so that all frequencies are equally important , and they all have the same average energy , @xmath42 .",
    "the planck formula correctly identifies the parameter @xmath143 as the important dividing line , but the assumptions of the derivation also break down at high frequency .",
    "the einstein derivation of 1907 ( where the energy levels are quantized , and the probability that a state @xmath144 is occupied is @xmath145 ) , does not suffer from this defect .",
    "once he had shown that the energy levels of the oscillator are quantized , einstein also realized that eq .",
    "( [ g2.16 ] ) , connecting @xmath20 with the average energy of an oscillator , @xmath82 , is inconsistent , since it was derived using a classical oscillator that absorbs and emits energy continuously .",
    "but he thought the equation must be true on the average .",
    "so it is clear why planck s derivation left the situation in a state of great confusion for a long time .      in 1909 , einstein looked at the fluctuations in the planck formula [ einstein ( 1909 ) ] and noticed a simple , but very deep relation .",
    "it was in this paper that einstein introduced eq .",
    "( [ g2.19 ] ) for the fluctuations .",
    "we can see the result already from planck s early ad - hoc derivation of his result , eq .",
    "( [ g2.23 ] ) . and",
    "if we insert eq .",
    "( [ g2.23 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ g2.19 ] ) , we get@xmath146if one believes that the energy levels of the oscillator are quantized , so that @xmath147 , as einstein did , and @xmath148 , where @xmath149 represents the average level of the oscillator , one can also put this into the form,@xmath150    this also holds true for the field excitations if one considers the field modes to be oscillators .",
    "he then pointed out that in his paper on photons in 1905 ( they were not explicitly called  photons \" until 1926 [ lewis ( 1926 ) ] ) , he had used the wien radiation formula when he discussed the radiation as resembling individualized excitations , and had shown how it resembled the independent particles of a perfect gas .",
    "he then identified the first term with the fluctuations of a group of independent particles , while the second term must correspond to the fluctuations in a cavity of classical waves .",
    "( this result was expressed in terms of the energy density of a small finite volume of the cavity , via eq .",
    "( [ g2.16 ] ) , but the justification was essentially a dimensional argument , which said that in the classical limit where @xmath109 does nt contribute , and one has nothing else with the dimensions of energy , one needs @xmath151 : @xmath152 .",
    "an explicit later calculation by lorentz [ lorentz ( 1912 ) ] proved the result . ) but the eqs .",
    "( [ g2.33 ] ) and ( [ g2.34 ] ) are exact and hold even when one is not in either of the two classical limits represented by particles or waves . and",
    "so this paper is generally taken as the birth of the wave - particle duality that has perplexed physicists up to the present time .      in 1917 , einstein [ einstein ( 1917 ) ] published his famous @xmath107 and @xmath153 coefficients paper .",
    "the paper was in two parts , the first of which discussed energy transformations and rates of absorption and emission for the various processes that go on in an atom or molecule in equilibrium with the radiation in a cavity .",
    "the second part discusses momentum transfer during these processes .",
    "this paper was very seminal in that it taught us how to think about radiation .",
    "it is not only the starting point for laser physics , but it also pretty much made the existence of energy levels essential , showing how they lead naturally to planck s radiation law .",
    "einstein assumed that the molecule could occupy only a discrete set of allowed states \\{@xmath154 } which had energies \\{@xmath155 } , and whose relative probability of occupation at temperature @xmath77 is@xmath156    where the @xmath157 represent statistical weights .",
    "he then assumes that a molecule can decay spontaneously from a state @xmath158 to @xmath159 , ( such that @xmath160 ) , and emit energy @xmath161 the probability per molecule for this to occur in time @xmath162 he takes as@xmath163as analogies , he quotes radioactive @xmath73 decay and hertzian oscillators .",
    "he then assumes that there are induced ( stimulated ) emission and absorption processes , which he calls a quantum theoretical hypothesis , that he assumes take place with a probability@xmath164for absorption from the lower level to the higher level , and@xmath165for emission from the higher level to the lower level .",
    "these are for transitions induced by the external field . even without introducing the quantized states , in the classical picture for absorption and emission used by planck , eqs .",
    "( [ g2.14 ] ) and ( [ g2.15 ] ) , the rates were proportional to the density of the surrounding radiation .",
    "if we then equate emission and absorption at equilibrium ( detailed balance ) , we get@xmath166    then if we take the limit @xmath167 , for which also @xmath168 , then @xmath169 , and@xmath170    this formula immediately leads to the bohr rule @xmath171 , and in the high temperature limit , where the rayleigh - jeans law holds , we can evaluate @xmath172 , which leads to the planck radiation law . even after the development of non - relativistic quantum mechanics , until the advent of field theory ,",
    "einstein s derivation was needed to calculate the spontaneous emission of radiation .",
    "like in much of the rest of this story , there is an irony in einstein s introduction of his @xmath107 and @xmath153 coefficients .",
    "to einstein himself , the most important part of the paper was the second part .",
    "the derivation in this part is more difficult , and is usually ignored today , but the point of the calculation was the consideration of momentum conservation in the radiation process , rather than merely energy conservation . by methods reminiscent of his derivation of brownian motion , he proved that to preserve thermal equilibrium in a gas of atoms , or molecules , during the decay process one must consider that in the individual decays , the atom recoils , acquiring the appropriate momentum . in his words ,  if the molecule undergoes a loss of energy of magnitude @xmath1 without external influence , by emitting this energy in the form of radiation ( spontaneous emission ) , this process is also a directed one .",
    "there is no emission in spherical waves .",
    "the molecule suffers in the spontaneous elementary process a recoil of magnitude @xmath173 in a direction which is in the present state of the theory determined only by chance. \"    the irony implicit in this derivation is brought out in his subsequent statement ,  these properties of the elementary processes required by eq .",
    "( 12 ) [ an equilibrium equation of the momentum fluctuations ] make it seem practically unavoidable that one must construct an essentially quantum theoretical theory of radiation .",
    "the weakness of the theory lies , on the one hand , in the fact that it does not bring any nearer the connection with the wave theory and , on the other hand , in the fact that it leaves moment and direction of the elementary processes to chance ; all the same , i have complete confidence in the reliability of the method used here . \"",
    "this is the paper that introduced chance into the radiation process in an essential way .",
    "after this , it was an inevitable and inescapable part of the quantum landscape .",
    "he had to introduce it in order to make it clear that the photons were emitted in individual quantum processes , and carried both energy and momentum .",
    "this was very important to him , because even at this late date , which was already 1917 , the existence of the photon was not yet generally accepted .",
    "but even as he introduced the element of chance in an essential way , he lamented it .",
    "there is a strong parallel here between einstein and planck , who both introduced revolutionary thoughts brought about by necessity after a long intellectual odyssey . yet",
    "no sooner had planck let the genie of the quantum out of the bottle , than he devoted many years effort to unsuccessfully trying to force it back in , without destroying the revolution it had brought about . and einstein had the same experience .",
    "once he had let the genie of chance out of the bottle , he unsuccessfully spent the rest of his life trying to stuff it back in . not that this diminishes by one iota the accomplishments of these two great men , but it does point up the ironies that life has in store for the best of us .",
    "in 1924 , bose made the seminal observation that it is possible to derive planck s radiation law from purely corpuscular arguments without invoking at all the wave properties of light resulting from maxwell s field equations .",
    "the main ingredient in bose s argument was the indistinguishability of the particles in question and a new way of counting them  now universally known as `` bose - einstein statistics ''  which pays careful attention to what is implied by their being indistinguishable . in the case of light quanta , an additional feature is that their number is not conserved , because light is easily emitted and absorbed .",
    "massive particles ( atoms , molecules ,  ) , by contrast , are conserved and therefore , as einstein emphasized [ einstein ( 1924 ) , einstein ( 1925 ) ] , their indistinguishability has further consequences , of which the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is the most striking one .",
