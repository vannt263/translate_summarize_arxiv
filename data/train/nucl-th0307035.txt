    "while transport calculations have , in general , been very successful in describing particle production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite , one of the remaining open problems in the transport - theoretical description of heavy - ion collisions at sis energies ( @xmath3 a gev ) is an overprediction of the pion multiplicity @xcite . at the beam energies of a few a gev the dominating mechanism of the pion production is the excitation of the @xmath4 resonance in a nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collision followed by its decay : @xmath0 , @xmath5 .",
