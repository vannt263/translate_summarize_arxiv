    "effective field theory ( eft ) is a powerful tool for describing the strong interactions at low energies @xcite .",
    "starting point is the chiral @xmath1 symmetry of qcd in the limit of @xmath2 massless quarks and its spontaneous breakdown to @xmath3 in the ground state . instead of solving qcd in terms of quarks and gluons , its low - energy physics ( of the mesonic sector )",
    "is described using the most general lagrangian containing the goldstone bosons as effective degrees of freedom .",
    "physical quantities are calculated in terms of an expansion in @xmath4 , where @xmath5 stands for momenta or masses that are smaller than a certain momentum scale @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for an introduction ) . in the following",
    "we will outline some recent developments in devising a renormalization scheme leading to a simple and consistent power counting for the renormalized diagrams of a manifestly lorentz - invariant approach to baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the standard effective lagrangian relevant to the single - nucleon sector consists of the sum of the purely mesonic and @xmath7 lagrangians , respectively , @xmath8 which are organized in a derivative and quark - mass expansion .",
    "the aim is to devise a renormalization procedure generating , after renormalization , the following power counting : a loop integration in @xmath9 dimensions counts as @xmath10 , pion and fermion propagators count as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , vertices derived from @xmath13 and @xmath14 count as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath17 generically denotes a small expansion parameter such as , e.g. , the pion mass .",
    "several methods have been suggested to obtain a consistent power counting in a manifestly lorentz - invariant approach . as an illustration consider the integral @xmath18[k^2+i0^+]},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a small quantity . in the infrared ( ir ) regularization of becher and leutwyler @xcite",
    "one makes use of the feynman parametrization @xmath20 ^ 2}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting integral over the feynman parameter @xmath23 is then rewritten as @xmath24 where the first , so - called infrared ( singular ) integral satisfies the power counting , while the remainder violates power counting but turns out to be regular and can thus be absorbed in counterterms .",
    "the central idea of the extended on - mass - shell ( eoms ) scheme@xcite consists of performing additional subtractions beyond the @xmath25 scheme . in ref .",
    "@xcite the ir regularization of becher and leutwyler was reformulated in a form analogous to the eoms renormalization scheme . within this ( new ) formulation",
    "the subtraction terms are found by expanding the integrands of loop integrals in powers of small parameters ( small masses and lorentz - invariant combinations of external momenta and large masses ) and subsequently exchanging the order of integration and summation .",
    "the new formulation of ir regularization can be applied to diagrams with an arbitrary number of propagators with various masses ( e.g. , resonances ) and/or diagrams with several fermion lines as well as to multi - loop diagrams .",
    "it has been known for some time that chpt results at @xmath26 only provide a decent description of the electromagnetic sachs form factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 up to @xmath29 and do not generate sufficient curvature for larger values of @xmath30 @xcite . to improve these results higher - order contributions have to be included .",
    "this can be achieved by performing a full calculation at @xmath31 which would also include the analysis of two - loop diagrams .",
    "another possibility is to include additional degrees of freedom , through which some of the higher - order contributions are re - summed .",
    "both the reformulated ir regularization and the eoms scheme allow for a consistent inclusion of vector mesons which already a long time ago were established to play an important role in the description of the nucleon form factors .",
    "figure [ g_neu ] shows the results for the electric and magnetic sachs form factors in the eoms scheme ( solid lines ) and the infrared renormalization ( dashed lines ) @xcite .",
    "consistent _ inclusion of vector mesons clearly improves the quality of the description .",
    "similarly , the inclusion of the axial - vector meson @xmath32 results in an improved description of the experimental data for the axial form factor @xcite .      using the reformulated infrared regularization @xcite we have calculated the nucleon mass up to and including order @xmath0 in the chiral expansion @xcite : @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ h1:emff : massexp ] ) , @xmath34 denotes the nucleon mass in the chiral limit , @xmath35 is the leading term in the chiral expansion of the square of the pion mass , @xmath36 is the renormalization scale ; all the coefficients @xmath37 have been determined in terms of infrared renormalized parameters .",
    "our results for the renormalization - scheme - independent terms agree with the heavy - baryon chpt results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the numerical contributions from higher - order terms can not be calculated so far since , starting with @xmath38 , most expressions in eq .",
    "( [ h1:emff : massexp ] ) contain unknown low - energy coupling constants ( lecs ) from the lagrangians of order @xmath26 and higher .",
    "the coefficient @xmath39 is free of higher - order lecs .",
    "figure [ fig : nucleonmass ] shows the pion mass dependence of the term @xmath40 ( solid line ) in comparison with the term @xmath41 ( dashed line ) for @xmath42 mev . for @xmath43",
    "the @xmath39 term is as large as the @xmath44 term .",
