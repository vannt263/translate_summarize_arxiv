    "the covariance of physical laws under boosts and rotations is at the basis of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and general relativity @xcite .",
    "this lorentz symmetry is closely related to the invariance under the combined action of charge conjugation , parity inversion , and time reversal , i.e. cpt symmetry @xcite . over the last few decades the interest in the possibility of breaking lorentz and cpt symmetry has been growing .",
    "this rise is motivated by theories that attempt to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics and that exhibit mechanisms of lorentz and cpt breaking  @xcite .",
    "the detection of a corresponding experimental signal would provide profound new physical insights and could point us to the correct theory of quantum gravity .    in this context , the standard - model extension ( sme )",
    "has proven to be a tool of great value .",
    "it is a framework that incorporates lorentz- and cpt - violating effects into the sm @xcite , gravity @xcite , and for matter - gravity couplings @xcite , by extending the lagrangian to include all possible lorentz- and cpt - violating operators consisting of the conventional fields . because of its generality it allows for broad experimental searches @xcite as well as general theoretical considerations of lorentz- and cpt - violating effects .    of particular interest",
    "is the pure - gauge matter sector of the minimal sme , which includes only superficially renormalizable operators",
    ". here , lorentz violation ( lv ) can be introduced , either while preserving cpt , or while violating it . in this paper",
    "we consider the chern - simons - like operator of mass dimension three that causes both cpt- and lorentz - symmetry breaking , parametrized by a fixed background vector @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although bounded observationally to minute levels @xcite , this term has received intensive attention in the literature , as it arises as a radiative correction from the fermion sector in the presence of a lv axial - vector term @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to establish both in the fermion and the photon sector , whether such effects impede a rigorous quantization , and if not , in what way the standard procedures have to be modified .",
    "while the quantization of the fermion sector was implemented successfully in the past @xcite , the situation is more ambiguous in the photon sector .",
    "furthermore , while cpt - violating effects are strongly bounded in the photon sector , this is not at all the case in the gluon and weak gauge - boson sector @xcite .",
    "although we only consider the abelian case here , our analysis may lead to important implications for lv non - abelian theories as well .    in this paper",
    ", we thus perform the covariant quantization of maxwell - chern - simons theory .",
    "covariant quantization is extremely useful in performing quantum - field - theoretic calculations , as the formulas retain explicit covariance throughout the computational procedure . in a previous work ,",
    "it was discussed how this can be implemented for the cpt - preserving case @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the quantization for purely timelike @xmath1 was discussed and applied to calculate vacuum - cherenkov - radiation rates , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite , attention was restricted to the ( massless ) case of purely spacelike @xmath0 in an axial gauge .",
    "although some of the present results were already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the approach we take here is more general and rigorous , while we consider spacelike , lightlike , as well as timelike values of @xmath0 in a general class of covariant gauges .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the introduction of a mass regulator turns out to be necessary for a consistent quantization .",
    "this is phenomenologically feasible , due to the fact that ultra - tight observational bounds on @xmath0 @xcite allow the choice of a photon mass sufficiently large to fix quantization problems , while simultaneously agreeing with current experimental bounds .",
    "furthermore , the introduction of a photon mass is often used to regulate infrared divergences that turn up in loop diagrams in both conventional calculations , and in the context of lv effects @xcite .",
    "we note that the introduction of a photon mass in the context of the sme has been studied in the presence of both cpt - preserving and cpt - violating terms at the level of the equations of motion and the propagator in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ lagrintroduction ]",
    "we introduce the lorentz- and cpt - violating model , including a nonzero photon mass that is introduced through the stckelberg mechanism .",
    "subsequently , we find a covariant basis of normalized and orthogonal eigenvectors of the equation - of - motion operator in section  [ sec : polvec ] .",
    "these polarization vectors satisfy modified orthogonality relations when fixed to be on shell . in section  [ sec : disprel ] we analyze the equations of motions in momentum space , and show that for the case of timelike @xmath0 the introduction of a nonzero mass parameter avoids a region in three - momentum space that has no corresonding real energy solutions . we also find a condition on @xmath2 that guarantees energy positivity .",
    "energy positivity and its connection to stability is further discussed in section  [ sec : energypositivity ] , where we find a way to distinguish different branches of the dispersion relation in any observer frame .",
    "we derive a relation between the momentum - space propagator and the polarization vectors in section  [ sec : propandpol ] . the field operator is then quantized in terms of creation and annihilation operators in section  [ quantization ] .",
    "subsequently , the commutator of fields at spacelike separation is worked out in section  [ causality ] , and it is shown that the theory satisfies microcausality . in section  [ feynprop ]",
    "the feynman propagator is derived and in section  [ brst ] we analyze the space of states in the context of brst quantization .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "some of the more detailed analyses of the dispersion relation , the photon group velocity , and the energy lower bound are relegated to the appendices .",
    "cpt violation in the photon sector of the power - counting renormalizable part of the sme is given by the lagrangian @xmath3 where @xmath0 is an arbitrary real - valued and fixed background vector with the dimensions of mass .",
    "the cpt - violating term in eq .   is gauge invariant up to total derivative terms , which , in the absence of topological obstructions , do not influence the physics .    the theory in eq .",
    "breaks so - called particle lorentz symmetry , while it is invariant under observer lorentz transformations @xcite .",
    "observer lorentz transformations are just transformations of the coordinates of the reference frame of the observer and thus transform both @xmath0 and the fields .",
    "particle lorentz transformations , on the other hand , affect only the particle fields , but leave the tensor @xmath0 unchanged .",
    "this corresponds to changing the orientation and/or velocity of the experimental system in absolute space .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the cases of spacelike , lightlike , and timelike @xmath0 .",
    "as is well known @xcite , for timelike @xmath0 the dispersion relation following from ( [ l - massless ] ) has a tachyonic character : there are ( small ) momenta for which there are no corresponding real solutions for the energy , signaling an unstable theory that does not permit a consistent quantization ( although proposals have been made for fermionic theories @xcite ) .    as was noted first in @xcite , a way around this problem is to introduce a small mass term for the photon through the stckelberg mechanism @xcite .",
    "the gauge - fixed photon lagrangian becomes @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a gauge - fixing parameter and @xmath6 is the small photon mass .",
    "for spacelike , lightlike , as well as timelike values of @xmath0 , a nonzero photon mass is useful .",
    "in addition to its use as a regulator for infrared divergences @xcite , it allows for the introduction of so - called concordant frames @xcite .",
    "concordant frames are observer frames in which the lv effects can be treated as small perturbations to the lorentz - symmetric physics . for nonzero values of @xmath0 , this can not be the case in all frames , because @xmath0 changes under the action observer lorentz transformations .",
    "therefore , the size of its components is in principle unbounded , if one allows for arbitrary observer frames . to be compatible with experimental constraints , earth s restframe",
    "is then presumed to be in a concordant frame . however , to say anything meaningful about the size of the components of @xmath0 , we need a nonzero photon mass , since it is the only other dimensionful parameter in eq .  . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the required size of photon mass lies many orders of magnitude below its experimental bounds .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in section  [ sec : disprel ] .",

    "contraction of eq .   with @xmath12 yields @xmath13 demonstrating that there is a gauge mode satisfying @xmath14 .",
    "this expression also establishes that the physical polarization vectors , corresponding to the remaining modes , satisfy @xmath15 .",
    "the contraction of eq .   with @xmath16 gives a similar expression that demonstrates the fact that the physical polarization modes either obey the conventional dispersion relation @xmath17 , or the corresponding polarization vectors satisfy @xmath18 .",
    "these facts are confirmed by the explicit expressions for the polarization vectors in eq .   and by the functions defining the dispersion relations in eq .  .",
    "when the eigenvectors @xmath8 satisfy eq .  , they are functions of the three - momentum @xmath19 , since @xmath20 is fixed by the dispersion relation . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , quantization can be carried out referring only to these on - shell polarization vectors . however , it turns out to be useful to consider @xmath21 as functions of both @xmath22 and @xmath19 that satisfy @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the eigenvalue of @xmath25 belonging to the polarization mode @xmath10 .",
    "the relation @xmath26 can then be imposed to enforce the equation of motion .",
    "each of the resulting dispersion relations has two solutions , corresponding to the conventional positive and negative energies .",
    "usually , one then uses the positive root of @xmath24 to define the energy of the on - shell polarization vectors .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : disprel ] we show that in the present lv case , the sign of the roots of @xmath27 is invariant only in concordant frames @xcite , i.e. frames where the components of @xmath0 are small compared to the photon mass . in non - concordant frames this sign can depend on the size and direction of @xmath19 .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail in section  [ sec : disprel ] .",
    "for now , we let @xmath28 denote the root of @xmath24 that is positive in a concordant frame . substituting the solution @xmath29 in the expression for @xmath21",
    "then gives the relevant on - shell polarization vector that satisfies the equation of motion in eq .  .",
    "we determine the explicit solutions for the polarization vectors @xmath30 of eq .   by expanding in the four basis vectors @xmath31 here",
    ", the four - vector @xmath32 is an arbitrary , observer - covariant , four - vector with at least one component perpendicular to the subspace formed by @xmath33 and @xmath0 .",
    "note that it is generally not possible to use only a single @xmath32 vector to cover all of momentum space due ultimately to the theorem that `` the hair on a sphere can not be combed '' , i.e. it is not possible to find a single , smooth , non - vanishing vector field on a sphere .",
    "this problem exists even in the conventional case in which one tries to construct a set of polarization vectors for the transverse , massless photons .",
    "there is always at least one direction in momentum space for which the polarization vectors must be non - smooth .",
    "this geometrical impediment to constructing a single , global frame field forces one to choose another external vector @xmath34 in a different direction than @xmath32 to define the polarization vectors in a small cone .",
    "the @xmath35 in eq .",
    "are normalization factors , that we choose to be real .",
    "the basis vectors are orthogonal in the sense that @xmath36 if @xmath37 .",
    "however , @xmath38 and @xmath39 become lightlike if @xmath40 while @xmath41 , and @xmath39 become lightlike if @xmath42 .",
    "note that this construction completely fails when @xmath43 .",
    "this is related to the existence of singular points on the on - shell energy surfaces there .",
    "we will discuss these singular points in more detail below eq .  .",
    "using the basis in eq .   and",
    "noticing that    @xmath44    it becomes straightforward to determine the polarization vectors .",
    "they are given by    @xmath45    [ polarvect ]    where the square roots in the expressions for @xmath46 are defined by the conventional principal value .",

    "thus gives the polarization vectors that solve eq .  .",
    "note that the basis set in eq .",
    "is valid in a larger part of momentum space , in the sense that the four - vectors solve the off - shell condition in eq .",
    ". this fact will be convenient for the analyses of microcausality and the feynman propagator .    excluding the hypersurfaces in momentum space where @xmath49 or @xmath50",
    ", it is always possible to choose the normalization factors in eq",
    ".   such that the polarization vectors in eq .",
    "are normalized to @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath35 , which we choose to be real , are determined by @xmath53    as mentioned previously , there are hypersurfaces in momentum space where the definitions in eqs .  , , and",
    "are invalid .",
    "first , momenta that satisfy @xmath49 yield polarization vectors @xmath54 that are lightlike .",
    "this is not a serious problem since @xmath49 does not intersect the mass - shell of modes @xmath55 , because of the nonzero photon mass .",
    "ultimately we only need to be able to define the on - shell polarization vectors , while the off - shell polarization vectors are very convenient , but not necessary .",
    "the more interesting , perturbed physical @xmath56 states are not problematic at @xmath49 .",
    "more serious singular points occur when @xmath42 , which happens , for example , when @xmath43 .",
    "this only becomes an issue if the mass shell of a physical polarization mode intersects the momentum - space hypersurface on which the singular points lie .",
    "when @xmath57 , the singular hypersurface never intersects the mass shell . in the case",
    "@xmath58 , an intersection occurs for all transverse polarization modes if @xmath59 with @xmath60 either @xmath61 or @xmath52 .",
    "at these two momenta , the dispersion relations of the modes @xmath62 are solved simultaneously , while @xmath63 also satisfies @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath63 , the physical polarization vectors in eq .",
    "all vanish .",
    "in fact , the lv term in eq .   also vanishes in these cases , so any polarization vector orthogonal to @xmath33 will satisfy the equation of motion there .",
    "we will choose to define the polarization vectors at @xmath64 by taking some limit @xmath65 of the off - shell polarization vectors evaluated at @xmath66 . at this value of the spatial momentum ,",
    "the polarization vectors are given by    @xmath67    [ singvectors ]    where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are normalization factors that satisfy    @xmath72    note that these definitions fail for @xmath73 .",
    "if this is the case , it is always possible to make a small observer lorentz transformation to a frame in which @xmath74 and define the theory there .",
    "this choice breaks manifest observer covariance at the singular point , but this seems unavoidable .",
    "we can not just put the polarization vectors in eqs .   on the mass shell defined by @xmath75 , since the factor @xmath76 becomes undefined , however , we are free to pick the positive sign that results from approaching the singular point from the direction @xmath77 and use it to make a choice at the singular point .",
    "the price we pay for doing this , is that we lose manifest observer lorentz covariance along a singular line ( on shell this corresponds to the two singular points ) .",
    "this does not cause any issues in the current paper as a complete basis of polarization vectors at each momentum is all that is required for a covariant field expansion , they need not be continuous through the singular point .",
    "in fact , it is not possible even in the conventional massless photon case to find a smooth set of transverse polarization vectors that globally covers momentum space due to the topological obstruction involved in `` combing the hair on a sphere '' .",
    "this means that manifest observer invariance is never possible as certain choices have to be made as to how the necessary discontinuities are placed in momentum space .",
    "an example of the physical effect of this obstruction can be observed in berry s phase @xcite in which a helicity state , adiabatically transported through a closed loop in momentum space , picks up a non - trivial phase proportional to the solid angle of the loop .",
    "this would not happen if a globally defined frame field of helicity states was possible .",
    "we can now summarize the orthogonality of the polarization vectors ( evaluated at the same four - momentum ) by @xmath78 with @xmath79 in eq .  , @xmath80 is the @xmath81 unit matrix and @xmath82 is the usual pauli matrix @xmath83 the indices @xmath10 and @xmath84 in eq .",

    "we apply the usual redefinition to the concordant - frame negative - energy solutions , i.e.    @xmath112    [ energies ]    this also defines our labeling of the roots of the different @xmath24 functions .",

    "the relations @xmath48 determine the dispersion relations for the different polarization modes and their solutions fix the on - shell polarization vectors .",
    "the hypersurface in momentum space where the definitions of the polarization vectors are invalid only intersects the relevant mass shells at two singular points and only for timelike @xmath2 .",
    "this corresponds to the vanishing of the lv term in the original lagrangian .",
    "we highlighted the treatment of these singular points throughout the paper .",
    "we discussed several properties of the dispersion relation .",
    "in particular , we showed that it has eight nondegenerate roots , except at the two singular points , where it has two sets of three degenerate roots ( and two nondegenerate ones ) .",
    "we confirmed that the observer - lorentz - invariant condition @xmath166 guarantees the reality of all the roots .",
    "moreover , we derived an observer lorentz non - invariant condition , @xmath319 , that makes sure that all energies are positive .",
    "since the latter condition can not be maintained in arbitrary observer frames , the sign of the roots can not be used to select a branch of the dispersion relation , as is done in the usual , lorentz - symmetric , case .",
    "however , we found that the sign of @xmath320 can be used instead .",
    "this fact is closely related to the observer invariance of the root ordering and the group velocity being smaller than unity .",
    "being able to unambiguously identify the different branches of the dispersion relation in all observer frames , allowed us to construct an observer lorentz covariant mode expansion of the photon field in terms of the polarization vectors for the different modes . using the resulting explicit expression for the photon field",
    ", we performed the quantization of the theory .",
    "we also derived the feynman propagator and showed that the theory is microcausal .",
    "finally we showed , in the context of brst quantization , that the three transverse modes are the physical ones .    one obvious direction into which one can extend the present work is investigating the massless limit .",
    "we expect that taking the limit @xmath321 at the end of a calculation of a physical observable gives a consistent result for lightlike and spacelike @xmath0 ( for timelike @xmath0 , the imaginary energies will reappear ) .",
    "all the more because the @xmath322 polarization mode seems to decouple in a gauge - invariant theory , because @xmath323 in that case , resulting in two physical states . as in the lorentz - symmetric case , in the massless limit",
    "it is not possible to find a basis of four orthogonal covariant polarization vectors in the general class of gauges we consider in this paper .",
    "however , we expect that it is possible , using brst quantization , to show that the non - covariant components of the field are unphysical and decouple .",
    "a second option for follow - up work is to include interactions and quantum effects .",
    "the latter might introduce other , possibly higher - dimensional , lv coefficients through radiative corrections . to go beyond tree - level one has to consider the effect of such effective lv coefficients .",
    "finally , one could try to apply the methods of the present work to the cpt - even @xmath324 term of the minimal sme or even include higher - dimensional kinetic terms for the photon , which have been categorized in ref .",
    "note that , in the latter case , one would have to find a way to consistently deal with spurious ostrogradski modes @xcite that arise due to higher - order time derivatives in the lagrangian .    presently , the fact that the covariant quantization of the present lorentz- and cpt - violating theory is possible , at least with a non zero photon mass ( well below observational constraints ) , despite the presence of negative - energy states in some observer frames , is an important result of this paper .",
    "it is of relevance , in particular , to considerations of vacuum cherenkov radiation , for which such negative - energy states are unavoidable .",
    "moreover , the explicit expressions for the polarization vectors , their bilinears , and the feynman propagator , in arbitrary observer frames , pave the way for calculations of lv observables involving @xmath0 .",

    "in this appendix we give the details of some statements made in the main text , concerning the sign and the possible complex - valuedness of the roots of @xmath122 .",
    "we do this by considering the functions defined in eq .   and plotted in figs .  [",
    "fig : timelikek ] and [ fig : spacelikek ] for the case of timelike and spacelike / lightlike @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "first of all , we discuss the condition @xmath325 for spacelike and lightlike @xmath2 , which is used below eq .  .",
    "the points @xmath326 are the points where the branches of @xmath327 start ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spacelikek ] ) and their expressions are given in eq .  .",
    ".   reflects the condition that these points stay inside the curve of @xmath130 .",
    "a little algebra shows that eq",
    ".   holds if @xmath328 where @xmath329 is the angle between @xmath19 and @xmath167 .",
    "since the expression on the right is always negative , we see that eqs .   and are always satisfied and thus that @xmath330 always have two real roots each for spacelike and lightlike @xmath2 .",
    "next , we consider the inequality @xmath331 which , for @xmath58 , is sufficient to make sure that the signs of @xmath113 and @xmath114 are different . for",
    "@xmath332 it can happen that @xmath333 is not real .",
    "however , in that case it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : spacelikek ] and the argument following eq .   that the signs of @xmath113 and @xmath114 will differ .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath334 if @xmath335 if @xmath2 is spacelike , the first square root can become imaginary .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath333 being imaginary , for which case @xmath113 and @xmath114 differ in sign . if both square roots in eq .",
    "are real , eq .   defines an interval for @xmath156 , outside of which eq .   is satisfied and @xmath27 has two roots of opposite sign . inside of the interval , however , the signs of @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the same and after the redefinition of one of the roots , the theory can contain states of negative energy .",
    "it is clear from eq .   that there will be no negative energies if @xmath319 , because the second square root is imaginary in that case .",
    "this confirms that the condition in eq .   implies energy positivity .",
    "furthermore , the second square root is real if @xmath336 for angles satisfying this inequality and @xmath156 in the interval in eq .",
    ", the two roots of the dispersion relation @xmath337 have the same sign . since we redefine the energies as in eq .",
    ", the theory will contain negative - energy photons if @xmath338 .",
    "this happens if the extremum of @xmath137 lies to the left of @xmath144 , i.e. if @xmath339 .",
    "the momentum of the photons with negative energy thus lies in a cone around the direction defined by @xmath340 ( and not in the opposite direction ) .",
    "finally , we show that all roots of @xmath27 are real if eq",
    ".   holds , i.e. if @xmath341 for lightlike and spacelike @xmath0 , this was already evident from the considerations following eq .  .",
    "in the following , we show it for timelike @xmath0 . to achieve this",
    ", we ascertain that if @xmath166 , we can always find a value of @xmath22 for which @xmath342 meaning that @xmath143 must intersect @xmath130 at two different values of @xmath22 , corresponding to the two real roots of @xmath27 . to proof this , we start with an ansatz for @xmath22 : @xmath343 with @xmath344 a dimensionless factor . at this value of @xmath22",
    ", we find    @xmath345    we do not gain much insight by solving @xmath346 for @xmath344 directly .",
    "however , we easily find that @xmath347 for @xmath348 furthermore , @xmath349 , as a function of @xmath156 , is a parabola that opens upward if @xmath350 .",
    "so , if @xmath350 and @xmath156 is in the interval defined by eq .",
    ", then @xmath351 .",
    "it follows that if we can find an @xmath352 such that the second square root in eq",
    ".   becomes imaginary , then the mentioned interval of @xmath156 does not exist and therefore @xmath346 for any @xmath156 .",
    "we find that the argument of the second square root in eq .",
    "vanishes if @xmath353 it is straightforward to check that the square root is real if @xmath354 and that the absolute value of first term is smaller than one in that case .",
    ".   thus defines an @xmath344-interval for which the second square root in eq .",
    "is imaginary .",
    "therefore , near the center of this interval , there are values of @xmath355 for which @xmath346 .",
    "this means that @xmath143 intersects @xmath130 at two different values of @xmath22 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath27 always has two real roots if @xmath166 .",
    "in this appendix , we consider the group velocity of the different modes of the photon .",

    "for the modes with @xmath359 this is trivial and we will only consider the @xmath56 modes in the remainder of this appendix .    the fact that eq",

    "from eq .  , it follows that , for @xmath361 ,    @xmath362_{p^0 = e_\\pm(\\vec{p } ) } = -\\left[\\frac{\\partial \\lambda_\\pm(p)}{\\partial \\vec{p}}\\bigg/ \\frac{\\partial \\lambda_\\pm(p)}{\\partial p^0}\\right]_{p^0 = e_\\pm(\\vec{p})}\\ , \\ ] ]    confirming eq .  .",
    "this equality does not hold if @xmath64 . in that degenerate case , the group velocity , as given in eq .",
    ", becomes ill - defined , as can be seen from explicit calculations for purely timelike @xmath2 , or from the analysis at the end of this section .",
    "however , we can assign a value to the right - hand side of eq .   by employing some limiting procedure , as described below eqs .  .",
    "this is in fact the quantity we need in eq .  .",
    "it remains to be shown that @xmath358 . to this affect",
    "we define @xmath363 such that @xmath364_{p^0 = e_\\lambda(\\vec{p})}$ ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath358 holds , if @xmath365 , evaluated on shell , is timelike .",
    "we determine that on shell @xmath366 is given by @xmath367 therefore , @xmath368 if @xmath166 .",
    "the latter is a necessary condition for the theory to be consistent , as already mentioned in section  [ sec : disprel ] .",
    "we thus conclude that the absolute value of photon group velocity is smaller than unity for the cases we consider . for the degenerate case of @xmath64 ,",
    "this statement is invalid , because eq .   does not hold ( the group velocity becomes ill - defined ) .",
    "however , eq .   shows that the quantity relevant for eq .  , which is the right - hand side of eq .",
    ", is smaller than unity , even if @xmath64 .",
    "we note that a method to desingularize the classical group velocity at the singular points exists @xcite .",
    "using the expression for the group velocity implied by eqs .   and , we will determine the lowest value the photon energy can reach in a particular observer frame .",
    "for the polarization modes with @xmath359 this is trivial , so we will focus on the @xmath56 modes . to find the stationary points of the energy as a function of @xmath19 , we will determine the @xmath19 values for which @xmath369 in eq .",
    ", vanishes .",
    "these points correspond to the lower bound for the energy , unless the energy at the singular point ( given by @xmath370 ) is smaller .",
    "it is straightforward to establish that @xmath369 vanishes if @xmath371 , if @xmath372 , or if @xmath373 , i.e. when @xmath374 is either @xmath156 or @xmath375 . in all of these cases , the dispersion relation can be solved exactly . for purely timelike and purely spacelike @xmath2 ,",
    "the concordant - frame - positive energy solutions are given by          the group velocity for the purely timelike case in eq .",
    "can only vanish for the @xmath115 mode , in which case @xmath378 , giving a energy lower bound of @xmath379 . for the @xmath118 mode , the energy lower bound for the purely timelike case",
    "is the energy at the singular point ( @xmath380 ) , at which the group velocity becomes ill - defined . if @xmath372 , the group velocity vanishes if @xmath381 ( we will deal with @xmath373",
    "seperately ) .",
    "it follows that the minimal energy is then given by @xmath382 .",
    "having dealt with the special cases of purely timelike and purely spacelike @xmath0 , we proceed to the general case where the lv four vector has both nonzero time and space components .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the group velocity then only vanishes if @xmath19 is ( anti)parallel to @xmath167 .",
    "the corresponding expressions for @xmath383 are given by : @xmath384 the lower expression only applies for timelike @xmath0 , because @xmath385 requires @xmath58 . for @xmath386 , which also requires timelike @xmath0 and corresponds to the singular point of eq .  , eq .",
    "gives @xmath387 , showing that the energy is continuous through the singular point .",
    "however , the group velocity that follows from eq .   is given by @xmath388 which is clearly not continuous through the singular point , because approaching from below gives @xmath389 , while approaching from above gives @xmath390 .",
    "using methods described in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can nevertheless rigorously define the group velocity at the singular points . here",
    "we instead choose to check explicitly if the energy at the singular point is the smallest energy value .",
    "we can thus use eq .   to determine the lower bound for the energies , unless the minimal energy is reached exactly at the singular point , which we check explicitly .",
    "investigating when the expression for the group velocity vanishes , while simultaneously satisfying the condition on the right , and comparing to the energy at the singular point , we come to the conclusion that the lower bound for the photon energies in the @xmath56 modes is given by          these results show , first of all , that the energy has a finite , albeit observer dependent , lower bound .",
    "furthermore , we confirm the results of appendix  [ appa ] , that the energy of the @xmath118 mode is always positive , while @xmath392 can become negative if @xmath149 .     and @xmath140 for timelike @xmath318 .",
