    "the observations were carried out in july and august of 2005 in photometric sky conditions with a typical seeing of about 0.9 arcsec in k - band .",

    "the observed spectral and spatial resolution , as measured from telluric lines and standard star observations , is summarised in table [ tabl_smooth_resolution ] .",
    "the reduction of the data was done using a combination of the eso sinfoni pipeline recipes ( _ sinfoni pipeline version 1.7.1 _ and _ cpl version 3.6.1 _ ) , eclipse @xcite and a set of dedicated idl procedures . from the sinfoni pipeline",
    "we obtain a masterdark frame , masterflat frame , hot pixel map and a slit curvature model .",
    "wavelength calibration , hot pixel removal , slit edge detection , distortion correction , sky removal and illumination correction as given by the pipeline were found to be inadequate for our purposes and therefore an additional set of reduction tasks was written in idl .",
    "the reduction was carried out as follows .",
    "source and sky frames are corrected for dark current and flat fielded using the masterflat and masterdark frames from the sinfoni pipeline . having estimated the slit edges ( by eye ) the different slits are defined and cut out of the science frames .",
    "each of these slits is then treated independently in the subsequent reduction steps .",
    "ccd artefacts are removed from the data .",
    "hot pixels and those affected by cosmic rays are interpolated over .",
    "we correct for the spatial curvature of the slit optics as imaged on the detector by applying the curvature model obtained by the sinfoni pipeline using the eclipse task _ warping _ @xcite .",
    "slit columns which do not contain information across the full wavelength range are removed .",
    "this also removes the overlap between different slits as imaged on the ccd .",
    "the spectra are wavelength calibrated using a set of 19 identified telluric oh lines in the wavelength range 1.95 - 2.30  @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the output wavelength scale is set to 2.45@xmath1410@xmath29  @xmath30 per pixel thereby nyquist sampling the data .",
    "the k - band night sky is variable on short time scales .",
    "we have rather long exposure times , as compared to the variations in the sky background .",
    "this means that there is a complicated relationship between the sky contribution in our source frame and the sky observed in our corresponding sky frame .",
    "this is readily observed by subtracting two sky frames taken directly after each other , and leads to systematic residuals of up to 10% in the peak heights of telluric lines .",
    "a scaling between the source and its corresponding sky frame thus needs to be performed in order to decrease these residuals .",
    "the standard sky scaling performed by the eso sinfoni pipeline reduces these residuals to about 5% and the special sinfoni pipeline sky correction utility reduces the residuals further to about 4% . in both cases",
    "it was noted that the sky removal suffered from poor wavelength matching between the sky and source frames due to flexure of the instrument .    in our approach",
    "we remove the sky emission after detailed wavelength calibration using the telluric lines .",
    "we a apply a simple scaling function to the sky frame before subtracting it from the source frame .",
    "this scaling function consists of a constant and a small , linear , wavelength dependent factor .",
    "the constant is determined from the relative heights , above the continuum , of the telluric lines and assumed to hold at 2.1  @xmath30 . the small , linear , wavelength dependent factor is the slope of a linear fit to the ratio of the object spectrum and its corresponding sky spectrum .",
    "the full wavelength dependent behaviour of the sky emission between an object and a sky frame is often more complex than the simple linear function used .",
    "here we are only interested in line emission and as such a small residual gradient in the continuum emission does not affect the analysis performed below .",
    "our method leads to residuals that are @xmath312% in the peak heights of telluric lines .",
    "this is a significant improvement over the other methods mentioned above . in the final analysis of the line emission we checked our results carefully for telluric line residuals and removed wavelength regions affected by these from our analysis .      after correcting for any residual distortion we collapse the sky and the sky subtracted source spectra into cubes with pixel size ( 0.125@xmath28,0.125@xmath28,0.000245  @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is known that sinfoni , after all reduction steps described above , still has a varying illumination across its fov and that this illumination is a function of wavelength ( j. reunanen priv . comm . ) .",
    "this is mostly due to a difference in the illumination of the various slitlets and most easily observed in the sky cubes . defining a reference slitlet in the sky cubes we determine the variation in illumination across the fov for each wavelength .",
    "we then correct for this variation in the sky subtracted source cubes .",
    "the correction is typically less than 10% and particularly affects wavelengths below 2.1  @xmath30 .",
    "flux calibration is carried out using one or , if available , multiple standard star observations per night .",
    "the standard star observations are reduced in the same way as outlined for the object observations above .",
    "all standard stars observed were either o or b stars , and brighter than 8th magnitude in the k - band . the atmospheric transmission function was determined by dividing the spatially summed standard star spectrum with a black body spectrum of the appropriate temperature .",
    "the absolute flux scale is set by using 2mass k - band magnitudes , these are accurate to 0.05 magnitude in k - band .",
    "following flux calibration the source cubes are combined .",
    "the northern and southern edges of the exposures for the different fields overlap well .",
    "the eastern and western edges overlap less well leading to a higher noise here .",
    "the most northern and southern slitlet have very low signal to noise and were removed from the data .",
    "any remaining telluric emission is removed by defining off - source regions .",
    "these are marked by the dotted lines in figs .",
    "[ fig_area_a2597_ss44 ] and [ fig_area_sersic_ss44 ] .",
    "continuum emission is removed by fitting the continuum in the immediate neighbourhood of the science line .",
    "the continuum subtracted line feature is fit by a single gaussian function , using the @xmath32 routine @xcite within idl . it is observed that a single gaussian always provides a good description of the observed line profile .",
    "the line flux , centre and width are determined from this gaussian fit . for selected regions",
    "line profiles and gaussian fits to them are shown in appendix [ app_tb ] .",
    "the errors quoted for the fitted line properties are based on monte - carlo simulations .",
    "in order to visualise the surface brightness of the line emission we performed a gaussian smoothing of four pixels full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) in both the spatial ( 4 pixels=0.5@xmath28 ) and the spectral plane ( 4 pixels=9.80@xmath1410@xmath29  @xmath30 ) . to visualise the kinematics of the line emitting gas a two pixel fwhm gaussian spatial smoothing and no spectral smoothing",
    "was found to be adequate for a2597 , whereas for s159 a two pixel fwhm gaussian smoothing in both the spatial and spectral planes was performed . the degradation of the spatial and spectral resolution as a function of the smoothing kernel used is given in table [ tabl_smooth_resolution ] .",
    "the corresponding noise is given in tables [ tabl_smooth_sensitivity_a2597 ] and [ tabl_smooth_sensitivity_sersic ] .",
    "surface brightness maps for all lines that could be mapped on a pixel to pixel basis are shown in appendix [ app_lmp_a2597 ] and [ app_lmp_sersic ] .",
    "for a2597 the northern field is not shown as the signal to noise here is inadequate to show the emission on the same spatial resolution as the central and southern fields .",
    "velocity and velocity dispersion are shown only for the strongest detected ionised and molecular gas line .",
    "we note that the velocity structure observed in all detected emission lines agrees with that shown for these lines .",
    "cool core clusters were first discovered by analysing their x - ray emission .",
    "these observations lead to the still unresolved cooling flow problem for the hot x - ray gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the cooler hii and h@xmath10 gas phases and will not focus on the cooling flow problem related to the hot x - ray gas . however ,",
    "in section 8 we will investigate whether there is a spatial correlation between the x - ray emitting gas and cooler gas phases . in order to do so",

    "in the central field we have selected four regions , a1 , a2 , a3 and a6 .",
    "region a1 corresponds to the nuclear region , a2 samples the region where the northern filament connects to the nucleus .",
    "a3 , just north of a2 , samples that part of the northern filament that appears to not be influenced ( directly ) by the nucleus anymore .",
    "lastly , in the central field a clump of strong emission is noted on the western edge of the field , which we selected as region a6 . there is tentative evidence for a narrow ridge connecting a6 to the nucleus , but we can not confirm this with the present observations .",
    "the emission in region a6 itself is also uncertain , due to the increased noise at the edge of the field .",
    "it is only observed significantly in two h@xmath10 lines and therefore we have not constructed an excitation diagram for this region .    in the south - eastern field",
    "we have selected one region , a4 , which captures most of the emission in the southern filament .",
    "this region was selected such to avoid the noisy overlap region between the se and sw fields .",
    "the strongest emission lines showed weak evidence in their surface brightness maps that the south - eastern filament may extend across the overlap region into the sw field .",
    "region a5 was selected to test this .",
    "significant line emission is found in this region .",
    "the kinematical structure of the gas observed in a5 is similar to that measured in a4 and thus a connection between the two regions seems plausible .",
    "the northern field also contains significant emission for the strongest emission lines .",
    "a systematic search for line emission in the northern field was performed using various binnings .",
    "region a7 was selected to show that emission does exist at a significant level in the northern field .",
    "j05 previously showed that molecular and ionised gas existed out to 20  @xmath0 north from the nucleus using long slit spectra .",
    "the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(1 ) , 1 - 0  s(3 ) and pa  @xmath11 lines are all detected at the 3.0 sigma level , and the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(5 ) line is observed at the 2 sigma level .",
    "all four detected lines show the same velocity structure .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gas in a7 is more difficult to constrain . of the four lines the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(3 )",
    "line is observed at the highest significance and has the most reliable fit .",
    "this line has a dispersion of about 60  @xmath19  @xmath17 using a spatial smoothing of two pixels .",
    "the other lines have higher fitted velocity dispersions ranging from 70 to 110  @xmath19  @xmath17 , however within their large errors ( 40 - 60  @xmath19  @xmath17 ) they agree with the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(3 ) result .",
    "the positive velocity and low velocity dispersion of the gas makes it plausible that the gas in a7 is connected with the northern filament .",
    "this interpretation agrees with the j05 results .",
    "we conclude that molecular and ionised gas is present at least up to region a7 , i.e. 22.5  @xmath0 from the nucleus , in good agreement with the j05 results .",
    "there is tentative evidence from regions investigated north and south of a7 within the northern field that line emission is present there as well .      in the se field",
    "we have selected four regions , b1 , b2 , b3 and b4 .",
    "region b1 corresponds to the nuclear region .",
    "b2 samples the tail of the northern filament as it connects to the nucleus .",
    "region b3 , just north of b2 , is selected to sample the filament where it is no longer ( directly ) influenced by the nucleus .",
    "lastly , b4 is selected to contain the clump of emission just to the south of the nucleus . whether this clump is part of a filament or",
    "not our observations can not confirm .    as discussed above ,",
    "the nuclear region b1 is significantly noisier than surrounding regions .",
    "the spectral noise is higher here by a factor two to three .",
    "the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(1 ) and 1 - 0  s(3 ) lines are still easily detected here .",
    "the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(3 ) line is considerably stronger than the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(1 ) line in this region as compared to any of the other regions .",
    "the pa  @xmath11 line is detected at a much lower significance and at a much lower flux level . in the sw field",
    "we have selected one region , b5 , which captures most of the western filament .",
    "we have selected two regions in the the northern field , b6 and b7 , to investigate the low level clumpy emission here .",
    "region b7 was selected to capture the strong clump of emission at the northern edge of this field .",
    "region b6 was selected to investigate the remaining emission .",
    "the summed spectra clearly show that line emission is present in the northern field .",
    "we can thus conclude that molecular and ionised emission is present at least up to 18.0  @xmath0 from the nucleus . whether the gas in the northern field is directly connected to that in the se field",
    "can not be confirmed by our observations , although it seems plausible from the j05 results .",
    "the velocity and low velocity dispersion of the gas are such that this gas can be connected smoothly to that in the northern filament .      in the case of a gas in lte , assuming a ortho : para abundance ratio of 3:1 , there is a simple relation between the flux @xmath50 and the temperature @xmath51 corresponding to the energy of the upper state of a line ,",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_lte_mod_a2597_ss20 ] that the h@xmath10 lines detected in these regions are well fit by a thermal excitation model , with an average temperature of about 2300  @xmath3 .",
    "the derived excitation temperature for each region is given in table [ tabl_line_area_a2597_ss20 ] .",
    "besides the best - fitting lte model for the h@xmath10 line fluxes we plot three additional h@xmath10 models .",
    "these models are shown for qualitative comparison purposes only , and are not tuned exactly to our physical conditions , see fig .",
    "[ fig_lte_mod_a2597_ss20 ] .",
    "the best - fitting lte model is given by the black solid line .",
    "the red dotted line is a low - density uv fluorescence model by @xcite that does not include collisions ( their model 14 ; @xmath61=3@xmath1410@xmath62 @xmath63 , a temperature @xmath4=100 @xmath3 and a uv intensity @xmath64=10@xmath62 relative to @xmath65 ) . the blue dotted line is a high - density uv fluorescence model by @xcite which does include collisions ( their model 2d ; @xmath61=1@xmath1410@xmath66 @xmath41 , a temperature @xmath4=1000 @xmath3 and @xmath64=10@xmath40 relative to @xmath65 ) .",
    "lastly the green dotted line is the cosmic ray model by @xcite , which was developed for the gas filaments observed in the perseus cluster .",
    "the black & van dishoeck low - density uv and the ferland cosmic ray models have distinct features that make them deviate from a thermal model .",
    "low - density uv fluorescence models tend to boost the higher s - transitions ( 2 - 1 , 3 - 2 , ... ) relative to the 1 - 0  s - transitions as compared to a lte model .",
    "the ferland model is observed to boost the even h@xmath10  1 - 0  s - transitions relative to uneven h@xmath10  1 - 0  s - transitions as compared to a lte model .",
    "the high - density uv model by sternberg & dalgarno simply shows that at high densities , collisions within the gas will cause it to become thermalised and thus the line ratios also produce a straight line in our excitation diagrams .",
    "we thus conclude , qualitatively , that out of the four models investigated here that a lte model provides the best description of the data .    as the molecular line ratios in a2597",
    "appear to be in lte this implies that the density of this gas is near its critical density , @xmath67  @xmath68 10@xmath66  @xmath69 @xcite and is dominated by collisional excitation .",
    "information regarding the source of excitation is thus not obtainable from this data set .",
    "there is a trend that on average we find higher lte temperatures of the molecular gas in the filaments as compared to the nuclear region .",
    "we note though that within errors the temperatures agree for all regions , except for a6 . neither the h@xmath10  1 - 0 nor the h@xmath10  2 - 1  s - transitions lie exactly on a straight line .",
    "if we use only pairs of lines like the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(1 ) , 1 - 0  s(3 ) line pair or the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(3 ) , 1 - 0  s(5 ) line pair to determine an excitation temperature , assuming lte , we find on average a temperature that is a few hundred degrees lower or higher than when all lines are used .",
    "typically the first pair gives a lower temperature and the second pair a higher temperature .",
    "if the h@xmath10 gas observed here is at its critical density then there is a pressure imbalance between the molecular gas @xmath70  @xmath2  @xmath71  =  @xmath72  @xmath68  10@xmath73 and the ionised gas has @xmath74",
    "@xmath2  @xmath71  =  10@xmath7510@xmath42  =  10@xmath66 . that the molecular and ionised gas are not in pressure equilibrium has previously been suggested by j05 using similar arguments .    for sersic 159 - 03 only two h@xmath10 lines",
    "were reliably detected in all regions .",
    "if we assume that the molecular gas here is in lte , we can calculate an excitation temperature for this gas .",
    "the resulting excitation temperatures for the selected regions are given in table [ tabl_line_area_sersic_ss22 ] .",
    "again we find an average temperature of about 2300 k for the h@xmath10 gas in the filaments .",
    "in the nuclear region the strong increase of the h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(3)/h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(1 ) ratio leads to a very uncertain and physically unrealistic temperature above the dissociation temperature for h@xmath10 .",
    "this either means that our line fits overestimate this ratio or that a different excitation mechanism is at work here .    in this work we have only considered the k - band h@xmath10 lines .",
    "these h@xmath10 lines do not show strong deviations from a single temperature thermal model with @xmath4  @xmath68  2000 - 2500  @xmath3 . from recent spitzer spectroscopy ( jaffe & bremer in prep . ) we find that another h@xmath10 gas component exists in the nuclear regions of a2597 and s159 with a lte temperature of about 300  @xmath3 .",
    "the situation in these clusters is thus similar to the situation in the perseus cluster where multiple temperature lte components have been invoked to explain the h@xmath10 line ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whether the need for multiple lte components to h@xmath10 line ratios hints at a multiphase gas , a difference in optical depth , or a different excitation mechanism is unclear currently .",
    "a more thorough modelling of the molecular gas , including all of the measured of the h@xmath10 lines in the infrared and mid - infrared , for a2597 and s159 will be presented by us in a future paper .      if we assume that the h@xmath10 gas is in lte and can be described by a single kinetic temperature of about 2000  @xmath3 , then the h@xmath10 1 - 0 s(1 ) line luminosity represents about 10 percent of the total h@xmath10 luminosity .",
    "this is estimated using a list of 312 h@xmath10 lines , corresponding to all h@xmath10 emission lines with an intensity greater than 1 percent of h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(1 ) line flux for @xmath4  @xmath76  4000k . from the total integrated h@xmath10  1 - 0  s(1 ) line fluxes in tables [ tabl_line_summ_a2597_ss44 ] and [ tabl_line_summ_sersic_ss44 ] we thus find @xmath77(@xmath78 , a2597 )  =  1.1@xmath1410@xmath79  @xmath16  @xmath17 and @xmath77(@xmath78 , s159 )  =  1.2@xmath1410@xmath80  @xmath16  @xmath17 within the fields observed by us .",
    "this is significantly below the total h@xmath10 luminosity estimated by j05 , i.e. @xmath77(@xmath78)@xmath210@xmath81  @xmath16  @xmath17 .",
    "j05 calculate the total h@xmath10 luminosity in the same manner as we do here .",
    "the difference follows from two simple arguments .",
    "firstly j05 assumed that the h@xmath10 1 - 0 s(1 ) line luminosity represents only about 1 percent of the total h@xmath10 luminosity .",
    "this is true for low - density uv excitation models such as the black & van dishoeck models .",
    "however , when the gas is in lte ( see above ) or in a xdr environment @xcite a fraction of 10 percent is found .",
    "the j05 results thus need to be corrected down by a factor of 10 as consequence of this .",
    "the second argument that j05 made is that the h@xmath10 emission coexists with the h@xmath11 emission .",
    "this argument follows from the hii / h@xmath10 ratio which is observed to remain rather constant over large areas ( j05 and this work ) . j05",
    "detect h@xmath11 over a much larger area than the fields observed by us .",
    "correcting our results upward for the area covered by the h@xmath11 map in j05 increases the h@xmath10 luminosity given above by a factor of 10 . with these corrections , we find that the h@xmath10 luminosity obtained in this work is in good agreement with the j05 results .",
    "to conclude , upon correcting our results for the area covered by the total extent of the ionised gas nebulae , we find h@xmath10 luminosities @xmath77(@xmath78 , a2597)@xmath210@xmath82 @xmath16  @xmath17 and @xmath77(@xmath78 , s159)@xmath210@xmath79 @xmath16  @xmath17 for our clusters .",
    "the analysis performed above relies heavily on the assumption that the h@xmath10 gas is in a single temperature phase .",

    "however , there are also filaments that are not related to current radio outflows .",
    "if these filaments were deposited at their current location by previous agn outflows , then this gas has had a long time to cool and should now be falling back at high velocities towards the potential centre .",

    "we will discuss the relation between the filaments and the radio emission in more detail below .",
