    "a chromosome is a long sequence of double helix dna made of base pairing by an adenine - thymine(@xmath0 ) pair or a cytosine - guanine(@xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , one dna strand decides the sequence of its complementary strand .",
    "a segment of dna sequence with half length greater than or equal to a pre - specified length @xmath2 is called a palindrome if one strand is identical to its complementary one running at the reverse direction .",
    "it has been observed that dna palindromes are common candidates for searching genetic motifs involved in different cellular processes , including gene transcriptions , gene replications , and gene deletions .",
    "for example , among nine octameres suggested to be transcription factor binding sites , three are palindromes ( fitzgerald et al , 2004 ) .",
    "this might be contributed by its potential to create the secondary genomic structure ( leach , 1994 ) .",
    "many studies have focused on investigating the occurrence rates of palindromes in suspicious regions against random sequences .",
    "for example , lisnic and svetec ( 2005 ) investigated the frequencies of palindromes in the yeast _ saccharmyces cerevisiae _ genome according to the length and contents of palindromes .",
    "chew et al ( 2005 ) proposed three score schemes , based on occurrence rates , length or its likelihood , to quantify the palindromes and found the association between the high score regions and the replication origins .",
    "lu et al ( 2007 ) reported that meaningful sites tend to have higher palindrome scores by comparing the scores over the regions including introns , exons , and upstream of transcription start sites against simulated random sequences .",
    "the performance of these comparison tests strongly depends on how accurate the occurrence rate is estimated for the random sequence .",
    "this rate is usually estimated by the average rate of palindromes on the genome - wide sequence .",
    "another approach is the iid model based estimator which a formula has been derived when the dna letter frequencies are estimated ( chew , et al , 2005 ) .",
    "however , we observed obvious discrepancies between these two estimates in various herpes virus genomes .",
    "for an example on the bhv1cgen(bohv1 ) sequence , average rate is 0.00166 and the iid model method estimate the rate as 0.00073 .",
    "while the average rate might be bias due to hot spot regions , the iid model might be too naive to describe the dna sequence . in this paper",
    ", we provided a formula to calculate the occurrence rate under a markov model , which the iid model would become a special case .",
    "for the bohv1 case , our method estimates the rate as 0.00098 .",
    "simulations are designed to check the performance of the estimates on the null occurrence rate , including with and without hot spot segments in the random sequences .",
    "the results show that our method performs better than the average rate in estimating the null occurrence rate against hot spot regions .",
    "chan and zhang ( 2007 ) developed a method to approximate the p - value of statistics for weighted poisson process , which can be applied on the dna palindrome problems .",
    "in their approach , the analytic formula for the moment generating function ( mgf ) of the palindrome score is required .",
    "however , the distribution of the palindrome scores have not been well studied except the length score under iid assumption .",
    "thus , we developed a method to derive the analytic formula for the mgf on various scores under markov model .",
    "furthermore , this analytic formula allows us to calculate an overshoot term in the p - value approximation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we show that three commonly used scores proposed by chew et .",
    "2005 ) can be derived by a likelihood approach firstly .",
    "secondly , we show that the occurrence rates can be calculated accurately under markov model through constructing a quasi transition matrix @xmath3 .",
    "thirdly , we derive the moment generating function for various scores under the markov model .",
    "last , we gave a p - value approximation with more precise calculations on the overshoot term .",
    "in section 3 , we show the numerical study for both real data and simulated data .",
    "this paper ends with a brief discussion .",
    "let @xmath4 be a counting process to describe the occurrence of palindromes and let @xmath5 denote the number of events in the interval @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "leung et al ( 2005 ) proved that @xmath4 can be approximated by a poisson process under markov model .",

    "they are palindrome count score(pcs ) , palindrome length score(pls ) , and base - pair weighted score of order m ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "pcs gives score one for each dna palindrome ; pls gives the score as the palindrome length divided by its minimum required lenth ; whereas @xmath11 gives the score as the minus log - likelihood with markov order @xmath12 .",
    "we would like to show that both @xmath13 and @xmath9 are equivalent to some log - likelihood ratio statistics when the alternative hypotheses are properly constructed . under the poisson process model ,",
    "@xmath7 s can be treated as iid with a density function @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an unknown distribution and @xmath16 .",

    ", the iid mode may not be a good model to describe the dna sequence well since it ignores the correlation between adjacent dna letters .",
