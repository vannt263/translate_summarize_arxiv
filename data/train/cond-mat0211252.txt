    "in bridging the gap between classical mechanics and thermal phenomena , the founding fathers of statistical mechanics realized that a statistical characterization of macrostates in terms of microstates is essential for understanding the typical time evolution of thermodynamic systems .",
    "but statistical reasoning requires proper counting , starting from a set of _ a priori _ equivalent microstates .",
    "that is different in quantum statistics from what is done in classical statistics .",
    "nevertheless the same concepts can be put in place . in this paper , we show for the quantum case what has been proven useful in the classical case : that entropy production measures the breaking of time - reversal invariance . more exactly , we show that the logarithmic ratio of the probability of a trajectory and its time - reversal coincides with the physical entropy production . + we continue with an introduction about entropy , both classical and quantum , to specify what we mean by entropy production .",
    "the main message is contained in sections 2 and 3 where the relation between entropy production and time - reversal is demonstrated .",
    "section 2 deals with a unitary evolution ( one initial preparation and one final measurement ) and can be considered as a special case of section 3 where the unitary evolution is further interrupted with measurements of the macrostate .",
    "the paper is based on elementary mathematical manipulations and the emphasis is on the conceptual framework .",
    "suppose a classical closed and isolated system of @xmath0 particles . a complete description consists in specifying its microstate , that is a point @xmath1 in its phase space , @xmath2 of positions and momenta .",
    "the dynamics is hamiltonian and energy is conserved .",
    "each microstate @xmath1 determines a macrostate @xmath3 corresponding to a much coarser division of phase space . to be specific",
    ", we consider the surface @xmath4 of constant energy and we suppose that the macrostates induce a finite partition @xmath5 of @xmath4 .",
    "the different macroscopic values thus specify a ( finite ) number of regions in phase space .",
    "we emphasize that this reduced description is in terms of macroscopic variables ( in contrast with the partitions as used e.g in constructions of dynamical entropies ) , such as position or velocity profiles and we denote by @xmath6 the corresponding phase space volume . + the boltzmann entropy ( also called boltzmann - planck - einstein or microcanonical or configurational entropy ) is , up to multiplicative and additive constants , defined by @xmath7 equals the thermodynamic entropy defined operationally by clausius . but also out of equilibrium , say when a constraint is lifted and the system is free to evolve , the boltzmann entropy remains relevant as it will typically increase towards equilibrium .",
    "it gives in fact the microscopic foundation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "+ there is another entropy that generalizes .",
    "suppose we only specify a distribution of macrovalues .",
    "this means that we do not know the exact macrostate , perhaps not even initially .",
    "the statistics of macroscopic values is then given by a probability distribution @xmath8 ; e.g. our best guess about the position and velocity profile . in the absence of any further information",
    ", there is a natural probability density , written @xmath9 , on @xmath4 which gives equal probability to each microstate compatible with a macrostate @xmath10 : @xmath11 the functional @xmath12 is appropriately called gibbs entropy as it is , since gibbs , the usual statistical mechanical entropy for constrained equilibrium is called the gibbs entropy of @xmath13 .",
    "there is however another name for that functional : the shannon entropy .",
    "a way out would be to call @xmath14 the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon entropy as in @xcite but that sounds overdone . ] .",
    "put differently , by gibbs variational principle , @xmath15 where the supremum is taken over all phase space densities @xmath13 with the same macro - statistics as @xmath16 , i.e. , the projection @xmath17 of @xmath13 on @xmath18 coincides with @xmath19 : @xmath20 and the supremum is reached for @xmath21 .",
    "equivalently , by a simple calculation , the gibbs entropy equals @xmath22 obviously , if @xmath16 concentrates on just one macrostate @xmath10 , @xmath23 , then @xmath24 which is the boltzmann entropy for that macrostate .",
    "more generally , the first term in is the expected or estimated entropy , being unsure as we are about the exact macrostate .",
    "the second term in is non - negative and is most often negligible , certainly upon dividing by the number of particles .",
    "+ when we start the system from a microstate that is randomly drawn ( according to the liouville measure ) from @xmath10 with probability @xmath25 and we record the statistics @xmath26 on the macrostates after time @xmath27 , then , always , @xmath28 this is not the second law ( e.g. it does not imply that @xmath29 is non - decreasing in @xmath27 , see @xcite for more discussion ) . to bring it closer to the second law",
    ", one needs to explain under what conditions @xmath29 approximates the boltzmann entropy @xmath30 with @xmath31 the time - evolved phase point .",
    "looking back at the first term in , that implies understanding how and when the empirical distribution for the macrovariables becomes peaked , as the number of particles increases , at a fixed macroscopic trajectory as described e.g. by hydrodynamic equations of irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "+ in @xcite we have discussed at length how these entropies relate to time - reversal .",
    "the main result there was that both for closed systems and for open systems , be it in the transient regime or in the steady state regime , the entropy production equals the source term of time - reversal breaking in the action functional for the distribution of the histories ( on some thermodynamic scale ) of the system .",
    "this representation gives the entropy production as a function of the trajectories and it allows simple manipulations for taking the average ( to prove that it is positive ) and for studying its fluctuations ( to understand symmetries under time - reversal ) . in the present paper",
    "we begin explaining a similar reasoning for finite quantum systems .",
    "we take the simplest mathematical set - up for describing a quantum system within conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the hilbert space of the system , assumed finite dimensional .",
    "the system is described in terms of a wavefunction @xmath33 , or perhaps better , a normalized vector in @xmath32 .",
    "the variables defining the macrostate are not different from that in the classical situation . for example , they specify ( again to some appropriate accuracy ) the particle number and the momentum profiles by associating numbers to a family of macroscopically small but microscopically large regions of the volume occupied by the system .",
    "therefore , the macrostate is given in terms of the values of a set of macroscopic observables represented by commuting operators . the macroscopic partition in the classical case above is replaced by the orthogonal decomposition @xmath34 into linear subspaces .",
    "the macrovariables are represented by the projections @xmath35 on the respective @xmath36 i d .",
    "we write @xmath37 for the dimension of @xmath38 ; it is the analogue of the phase space volume @xmath6 in the classical case .",
    "we can think of the macrostates as labeled by the running index @xmath39 . for a given macrostate @xmath39 represented by the projection @xmath35 above",
    ", we stretch the notation of and write its boltzmann entropy as @xmath40    so far , the above does not depart essentially from the classical set - up except for the important difference that is defined on microstates and is defined on macrostates . at this moment the treatment starts to differ . following von neumann , page 411 in his well - known book @xcite , as discussed e.g. in @xcite ,",
    "the formula is changed to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the probability of finding the system described via the wavefunction @xmath33 in the macrostate @xmath39 ( values corresponding to @xmath38 ) .",
    "observe that very much resembles , eventhough is the quantum analogue of , both defined as they are for the microstate .",
    "the reason is of course quantum mechanics itself : the wavefunction can still correspond to different ( mutually exclusive ) macrostates . if not initially , still later in time , superpositions in terms of wavefunctions of different macrostates are possible .",
    "this in contrast with the classical set - up where a unique macrostate is associated to each microstate .",
    "just as the second term in the classical arises from additional uncertainty as to the exact macrostate , here , even when the microstate is given ( in terms of @xmath33 ) , we still have a distribution on the macrostates .    instead of taking a pure state in ,",
    "we may want to consider the system in a mixed state and described by a density matrix .",
    "in fact , as we are interested in the thermodynamic time - evolution , we construct a special class of density matrices by specifying the macroscopic statistics just as we did for .",
    "we thus start from a probability distribution @xmath43 on the possible macrovalues and we randomize within .",
    "more precisely , we consider density matrices @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 for given @xmath46",
    ". then , @xmath47\\ ] ] is the probability to find the system in macrostate @xmath39 . for the choice @xmath48 where , for normalization , @xmath49 is the dimension of @xmath32 , @xmath50 id@xmath51 .",
    "+ in the other direction , given a general density matrix @xmath52 , we can take its projection @xmath53 on the macroscopic states : @xmath54\\ ] ] and of course , @xmath55 .",
    "we now apply the same principle as in to obtain the ( gibbs - von neumann ) quantum entropy @xmath56\\ ] ] with solution ( reached at @xmath57 ) @xmath58 which looks exactly like .",
    "again , @xmath59 equals @xmath60 when @xmath43 concentrates on the macrostate @xmath39 and , up to some irrelevant constants , @xmath59 equals the relative entropy of @xmath44 with respect to the equilibrium density matrix id@xmath51 .",
    "+ more generally , we call @xmath61 \\log d_\\alpha - \\sum_\\alpha   \\mbox { tr } [ p_\\alpha\\ , \\rho]\\,\\log \\mbox{tr } [ p_\\alpha\\ , \\rho]\\ ] ] the macroscopic quantum entropy of the ( mixed ) state @xmath52 , reducing to for the choice and to for a pure state .",
    "the goal of this section is to show that the total change of entropy under a quantum conservative evolution , that is the entropy production , can be given in terms of a logarithmic ratio of probabilities .",
    "we suppose a quantum dynamics generated via a real hamiltonian @xmath62 .",
    "this means that the hamiltonian is time - reversal invariant , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an anti - linear involution ( kinematical time - reversal ) which would be just complex conjugation for wavefunctions .",
    "the unitary evolution @xmath65 $ ] where @xmath27 is time ( and planck s constant is set equal to one ) then satisfies @xmath66 an expression of dynamic reversibility .",
    "we also assume that the macrostates are mapped into each other via the involution @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath67 for some @xmath68 , for each @xmath39 and we write @xmath69 .",
    "let the system be initially prepared with macro - statistics @xmath44 , see .",
    "we now leave the system alone , undergoing its quantum evolution . the probability to see the system at the initial time in macrostate @xmath70 and at time @xmath27 in macrostate @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 = \\mbox{tr } [ u(t)p_{\\alpha_0}\\rho(\\hat\\mu)p_{\\alpha_0 } u(t)^\\star p_{\\alpha_t}]\\ ] ] its marginal at time @xmath27 is @xmath73 = \\mbox{tr } [ u(t)\\rho(\\hat\\mu ) u(t)^\\star p_\\alpha]\\ ] ]    we consider the logarithmic ratio of probabilities @xmath74}{\\mbox{prob}_{\\hat\\mu_t\\pi}[\\pi\\alpha_t , \\pi\\alpha_0]}\\ ] ] where the denominator gives the probability of the time - reversed order of measurement results starting from @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "we make two observations .",
    "first , when @xmath48 , then also at later times @xmath77 and moreover @xmath78 = \\mbox{prob}_{\\hat\\mu_t}[\\pi\\alpha_t,\\pi\\alpha_0]\\ ] ] expressing the time - reversal invariance when started from the time - invariant macro - statistics that assigns to macrostates probabilities proportional to the exponential of their boltzmann entropy , see . + secondly , for other choices of the initial macro - statistics , the @xmath79 of reproduces the change of entropy : @xmath80 where we recognize the change of boltzmann entropies in the first two terms . upon taking the expectation @xmath81 \\ ,",
    "r_{\\hat\\mu}(\\alpha_0,\\alpha_t ) = s(\\hat\\mu_t ) - s(\\hat\\mu)\\ ] ] we recover the change in entropy .",
    "note that @xmath82 defined in for @xmath83 , @xmath84 so that the right - hand side of is really the change of macroscopic quantum entropy under the unitary evolution .",
    "the left - hand side of is a relative entropy , hence is non - negative .",
    "in contrast with the classical evolution , the unitary evolution can be non - trivially interrupted by measurements that reduce the state . we follow here the theory of von neumann ( or , convential quantum mechanics ) that adds a dynamic interpretation to the projections .",
    "we extend here the results of the previous section to include interactions with a measurement apparatus .",
    "+ suppose that we start the system described by a density matrix @xmath52 at time 0 and that we measure the macroscopic value @xmath39 at time @xmath85 .",
    "then , the new density matrix is @xmath86}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "this reduction takes place with probability @xmath88\\ ] ] we can generalize this to a sequence of measurements .",
    "we consider a sequence of times @xmath89 ( evenly spaced for convenience ) .",
    "a macroscopic trajectory @xmath90 assigns to each of these times a value for the macroscopic observables .",
    "in short , @xmath91 with each @xmath92 being equal to some projection @xmath35 on the linear subspace @xmath38 of .",
    "we consider the operator @xmath93 and , for a given density matrix @xmath52 on @xmath32 , the matrix @xmath94\\ ] ] this resembles the correlation matrix that is used in the definition of quantum dynamical entropy , see p. 189 in @xcite , but again , here our partitioning corresponds to macrostates .",
    "+ it is easy to verify that @xmath95 is non - negative and has trace one .",
    "we call it the path - space density matrix .",
    "+ @xmath95 depends on the initial density matrix @xmath52 and it also gives the probability to find the system after time @xmath96 of ( measurement-)free evolution in the macrostate @xmath39 : @xmath97\\ ] ] where @xmath98 .",
    "+ more importantly , the probability to measure the trajectory @xmath90 , i.e. , to see the system at the initial time in the macrostate represented by @xmath99 , at time @xmath100 in macrostate @xmath101 , and so on till time @xmath102 , is given by the diagonal element @xmath103 = \\cal{d}_\\rho(\\omega,\\omega)\\ ] ] its marginal at time @xmath96 , @xmath104\\ ] ] is the probability of macrostate @xmath39 when the unitary evolution was interrupted by @xmath105 measurements .",
    "it equals in case @xmath106 .      on trajectories ,",
    "the time - reversal transformation @xmath107 is @xmath108 since the microscopic dynamics is time - reversal invariant , we immediately deduce that @xmath109 and it is easy to verify that for @xmath110 id@xmath51 in @xmath111 in particular , for with @xmath110 id@xmath51 , prob@xmath112=$ ] prob@xmath113 $ ] .",
    "this identity has two related interpretations .",
    "first , it is the expression of ( quantum ) detailed balance or microscopic reversibility for the trajectories sampled from the time - invariant density matrix id@xmath51 corresponding to equilibrium .",
    "it is the generalization of .",
    "secondly , it generalizes the observation of @xcite that measurements do not introduce a time - asymmetric element ( or , the reduction of the wave packet does not lead to irreversibility ) .",
    "+ yet , in general , the system could start in a nonequilibrium state and evolve towards equilibrium .",
    "this involves a change of entropy ; that is , for closed and thermally isolated systems , its total entropy production .",
    "+ the time - reversal of the density matrix @xmath95 , written @xmath114 , is defined as @xmath115 so that by , @xmath116 .",
    "this last equality is broken for a general @xmath117 and it seems natural to estimate this breaking via the relative entropy @xmath118\\ ] ] in view of the classical results of @xcite , it is to be expected that this relative entropy is related to the entropy production for the appropriate choices of @xmath119 ( as initial state ) and of @xmath120 ( as time - reversal of the final state ) .",
    "we start again from @xmath43 as initial probability distribution ( i.e. , @xmath44 is the initial density matrix ) and the final probability distribution @xmath121 is defined in .",
    "the main result is now readily obtained starting with the analogue of : the logarithmic ratio of probabilities of a macroscopic trajectory , one started from @xmath43 and the other started from @xmath122 , is abbreviated as @xmath123}{\\mbox{prob}_{\\hat\\mu_t\\pi}[\\theta\\omega]}\\ ] ] this object will not always be well - defined for all @xmath90 .",
    "we can suppose however that the @xmath124 so that a little calculation of yields @xmath125 in the notation of , the first difference in the right - hand side of equals the change of boltzmann entropy @xmath126 for a trajectory that starts in macrostate @xmath70 and ends in macrostate @xmath71 . if the system is initially prepared in essentially one macrostate , @xmath127 , and if the evolution on the level of macrostates is quasi - autonomous till time @xmath27 in the sense that @xmath128 , then only that change in boltzmann entropies survives .",

    "the non - negativity follows from jensen s inequality applied to the left - hand side of .",
    "+ one can easily check that this expectation ( the left - hand side of ) and hence , the change of quantum entropy ( the right - hand side of ) , also coincides with the relative entropy on the level of density matrices for trajectories @xmath130\\ ] ] as announced in .",
    "entropy production , also for the quantum situation , has been under intense investigation in recent years .",
    "a list of related references , even restricted to the last 5 years would soon fill an extra couple of pages . in the classical case ,",
    "there have been essentially two types of approaches , dynamical versus statistical . in the dynamical approach ,",
    "entropy production is connected with the fractal or singular nature of a class of natural stationary measures .",
    "a key - notion is the phase space contraction rate and with some extrapolations , nonequilibrium statistical mechanics becomes a branch of the theory of smooth dynamical systems .",
    "it was partially motivated by numerical work and it has given wonderful insights , guiding towards a study of fluctuations of the entropy production , possibly generalizing close to equilibrium relations .",
    "the statistical approach emphasizes the sharp contrast between the microscopic and macroscopic scales and stochasticity enters the dynamical evolutions because of the reduced description . on space - time",
    "the histories have a distribution that share the essential properties of gibbs measures .",
    "the entropy production can then be identified with the source term of time - reversal breaking in the action ( or space - time lagrangian ) of the space - time distribution ; the gibbs formalism reproduces and extends the results for the fluctuations of the entropy production obtained in the purely dynamical approach .",
    "the projections on equal time surfaces reproduce the time - evolved measure . in the quantum case",
    ", the modern dynamical approach does not seem to have a natural generalization .",
    "instead , the old machinery of operator - algebra and spectral theory , directly applied on infinite volume systems , has been providing encouraging results for relaxation to equilibrium and the positivity of entropy production in driven quantum systems . again however , the conceptual framework and the essential distinction between microstates and macro - statistics is , at least to our taste , most often blurred in non - intuitive dynamical assumptions and in the heavy mathematical formalism .",
    "the present paper offers an alternative and starts the statistical approach for quantum systems .",
    "the first step indeed is to be quite clear as to the relation between time - reversal and entropy production . as in the classical case",
    ", we consider this important for constructing nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "specifically , we hope that the characterizations of and will prove useful for deriving general fluctuation and response identities going beyond close to equilibrium .",
    "+ we add some general remarks .    \\1 . for reversible systems",
    "the entropy production is a state function .",
    "it does not depend on the actual path but can be written as a difference of the same quantity evaluated at the initial and the final time , see or .",
    "this can be different for driven or irreversible systems .",
    "a similar treatment for such systems in the classical regime can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the main consequences of the identities that correspond there to or is that certain symmetries in the fluctuations of the entropy production rate are easily established .",
    "the quantum case is in preparation .",
    "nothing of the previous mathematical identities depends on the assumption that the system is large , of macroscopic size , containing a huge number of particles . of course , to meaningfully discuss macroscopic variables or macrostates and their trajectories",
    "one has in mind a clear separation between micro and macro scales but the results of sections 2 and 3 are true without . yet again , their interpretation as thermodynamic entropy production and the relation with the second law can only be made when dealing with macroscopic systems .",
    "see also appendix a in @xcite for these considerations in the classical case .",
    "the use of the projections @xmath35 in the construction of the path - space density matrix of section [ psm ] refers to the so called von neumann measurements .",
    "one can imagine more _ fuzzy _ measurements ( and more rounded - off macrostates ) and a corresponding decomposition of unity as @xmath131 the treatment above was restricted to the case @xmath132 .",
    "this extension is very much related to the dynamics of open systems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the involvement of measurements interrupting the unitary evolution already points to the interaction with the outside world .",
    "the question of isolation , even as an idealization , of a quantum system is much more subtle than for a classical system ."
