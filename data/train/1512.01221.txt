    "equilibrium statistical physics is governed by a universal principle stating that in an isolated system each microstate is equally likely . for a system in contact with a heat bath ,",
    "thus the famous gibbs - boltzmann distribution arises that involves only the hamiltonian of the system and the temperature of the bath . in non - equilibrium ,",
    "a similarly universal principle is not known and may not even exist .",
    "one characteristic feature of non - equilibrium systems is that they necessarily come with dissipation , i.e. , entropy production .",
    "non - equilibrium steady states , generated by time - independent driving have a constant average entropy production . observed for a finite time , the entropy change exhibits fluctuations that are universally constrained by the fluctuation theorem @xcite , which is arguably the most universal principle discovered for non - equilibrium systems so far .",
    "the fluctuation theorem relates the probability to observe a negative entropy change to the one for observing the corresponding positive value . in this sense",
    ", it constrains `` half '' of the distribution .",
    "experiments have illustrated and tested this symmetry , _ inter alia _",
    ", for colloidal particles @xcite , energy exchange between two conductors @xcite , small electronic systems at low temperature @xcite , molecular motors @xcite , and shaken granular matter @xcite . in a refined version ,",
    "the fluctuation theorem holds not only for entropy change but also for the joint probability of all currents contributing to the entropy change @xcite , which involves the corresponding affinities like non - conservative forces for colloids , chemical potential differences for bio - molecular reactions or voltage drops for electronic circuits .",
    "generally , these individual currents in a multi - cyclic network , however , are not restricted by the fluctuation theorem or any other universal result .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a complementary class of constraints , not only on the distribution of entropy change , but of any individual current in a network .",
    "these constraints universally bound the fluctuations over the full range of positive and negative values , in particular the extreme fluctuations .",
    "the crucial parameters characterizing these bounds are the average entropy production , the affinities , topological features like the number of states in a cycle and the activity , i.e. , the average number of transitions per unit time .",
    "if one knows such parameters , current fluctuations can be bounded independently of the specific transition rates .",
    "correspondingly , a measurement of such current fluctuations will make it possible to infer constraints on these parameters which in an experiment may not be known or not be directly accessible .",
    "this study substantially extends and generalizes work in which we have recently explored universal relations between dissipation and dispersion of currents leading to a general thermodynamic uncertainty relation @xcite and allowing the inference of topological properties of enzymatic networks @xcite .",
    "we employ the formalism of large deviations @xcite in which for large times the exponential decay of the tails of the distribution function is characterized by a rate function .",
    "this rate function can be obtained from the legendre transformation of the scaled cumulant generating function . for the latter ,",
    "we derive a series of lower bounds that can be divided into four classes : a parabolic bound , a hyperbolic cosine bound , an exponential bound , and an asymptotic bound relevant for large values of @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the real variable in the scaled cumulant generating function .",
    "the last two bounds can be proved exactly while the first two are conjectures based on extensive numerics .",
    "these universal bounds are valid for any nonequilibrium system described by a markov process with a finite number of states .    the hydrodynamic fluctuation theory for driven diffusive systems in contact with two reservoirs by bertini _ et al .",
    "@xcite has been another major development in nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "this theory leads to a ( typically hard ) variational problem that , if solved , leads to the exact rate function of the current of particles or heat between reservoirs .",
    "the additivity principle derived in @xcite is a more direct method that allows for the calculation of the scaled cumulant generating function related to the current in driven diffusive systems .",
    "for example , this method has been used to calculate this function for the symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) @xcite , the kipnis - marchioro - pressuti ( kmp ) model @xcite , and the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process ( wasep ) @xcite .",
    "these results are valid in the limit of large system size , for which the number of states diverges .",
    "even though our bounds are restricted to the case of a finite number of states , we show that the scaled cumulant generating functions obtained from the additivity principle for these three models lies inside our parabolic bound .",
