    "<S> yielding is central to the relaxation , flow and fracture of a wide range of soft and molecular glasses , but its microscopic origin remains unclear . here , we elucidate the yielding of a colloidal glass by using x - ray scattering to monitor the structure factor during the yielding process . we apply a recently introduced combination of small - angle x - ray scattering and rheology to the oscillatory shear , and follow the structure factor during the increasing strain amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we observe a sharp transition in the orientational ordering of the nearest - neighbor structure upon yielding , in contrast to the smooth variation of the viscoelastic moduli . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is accompanied by a sudden change of intensity fluctuations towards gaussian distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we thus identify yielding as a new , dynamically induced transition of the glass in response to the applied shear .    </S>",
    "<S> the yielding of glasses is important for a wide range of materials including metallic glasses , polymer- and soft glasses . </S>",
    "<S> yielding demarcates the property of any solid to flow and deform irreversibly under applied deformation  @xcite . at small </S>",
    "<S> applied stress and strain , the material deforms mostly elastically ; at larger strain , the material starts to flow irreversibly , resulting in permanent deformation . </S>",
    "<S> glasses are structurally frozen liquids with relaxation times exceeding the experimental time scale by many orders of magnitude and hence exhibiting solid - like properties  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yielding is central to many properties of glasses including time - dependent elasticity , relaxation , flow and fracture ; insight into yielding should provide a deeper understanding of the glassy state  @xcite , but remains challenging . </S>",
    "<S> the yielding of glasses addresses an important fundamental question : how does the dynamically arrested state respond to the application of stress ? while at the glass transition , microscopic observables change rather smoothly , yet rapidly  @xcite as a function of density or temperature , an important question to ask is whether a similarly smooth transition exists upon application of stress . </S>",
    "<S> the response to applied stress , however , remains poorly understood , partially because structural imaging of glasses during their yielding remains difficult  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> colloidal glasses provide good models for a wide range of soft and simple molecular glasses ; they exhibit dynamic arrest due to crowding at volume fractions larger than @xmath0 , the colloidal glass transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> microscopically , the particles are trapped within cages formed by their nearest neighbors allowing only for very slow structural rearrangements . </S>",
    "<S> these systems exhibit glass - like properties such as non - ergodicity and aging @xcite , and upon application of small but sufficiently large stress , they yield and flow  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the yielding of colloidal glasses has been widely investigated by oscillatory rheology , in which the sample is probed with a time - dependent , oscillatory strain . </S>",
    "<S> yielding is usually associated with the intersection of the strain - dependent storage and loss moduli , but the exact definition of the yield point remains a matter of debate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> constitutive relations have been used to model yielding based on structural parameters  @xcite , and recent advanced oscillatory rheology  @xcite and combined rheology and simulation  @xcite have provided some rheological insight into the yielding process . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , mode - coupling theory and simulations  @xcite have studied the nonlinear stress response in oscillatory shear , and shear heterogeneities in steady state shear and creep  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the direct observation and investigation of the structure during oscillatory yielding , which would give important insight into the nature of the yielding transition , remained elusive .    in this paper , we elucidate the microscopic yielding of glasses by direct measurement of the structure factor during the yielding process . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a recently introduced combination of x - ray scattering and rheology to the oscillatory shear of a colloidal glass to monitor the structure factor during the increasing applied strain amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to obtain new insight into the nature of the yielding transition : we identify a sudden symmetry change in the orientational ordering , reflecting a surprisingly abrupt transition from a solid to a liquid - like state of the glass . using a structural order parameter we demonstrate the sharpness of the induced transition as a function of the applied mechanical field . </S>",
    "<S> this sharp , dynamically induced transition under applied strain appears analogous to first - order equilibrium transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiments were carried out at the beam line p10 of the synchrotron petra iii at desy . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous rheology and structure factor measurements were achieved by placing an adapted rheometer ( mars ii , thermo fisher ) directly into the beam path of the synchrotron  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the well - collimated synchrotron beam with wavelength @xmath1 nm is deflected into the vertical direction to pass through the layer of suspension perpendicular to the rheometer plates ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the suspension consists of silica particles with a diameter of @xmath2 nm and a polydispersity of @xmath3 , suspended in water . </S>",
    "<S> a small amount ( @xmath4 ) of @xmath5 is added to screen the particle charges , resulting in a debye screening length of @xmath6 nm , and an effective particle diameter of @xmath7 nm . </S>",
    "<S> dense samples were prepared by diluting samples centrifuged to a sediment . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the relaxation time of these samples yielded @xmath8  @xcite , where @xmath9 is the brownian time , indicating that the suspension is close to the colloidal glass transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> estimation of the effective volume fraction from dilution of the centrifuged sediment yields a value of @xmath10 , consistent with this interpretation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after loading , the samples are sealed with a small amount of low - viscosity oil to prevent evaporation and maintain sample stability over more than 4 hours . </S>",
    "<S> samples were initialized by preshearing at a rate of @xmath11 s@xmath12 for 120 seconds followed by a rest time of 600 seconds ; this procedure guaranteed reproducible results </S>",
    "<S> . we then apply oscillatory strain with frequency @xmath13 hz and strain amplitude @xmath14 increasing from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ( 100 points on a logarithmic scale , three oscillations are averaged per cycle , leading to total duration of the experiment of around 5 minutes ) . </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously monitor the scattered intensity using a pilatus detector at a distance of @xmath17 cm operating at a frame rate of 10 hz . the detector with pixel size @xmath18 @xmath19m@xmath20 covers scattering angles @xmath21 in the range @xmath22 , allowing access to wave vectors @xmath23 in the range @xmath24 to @xmath25 . from the recorded intensity , we determine the structure factor @xmath26 by subtracting the solvent background and dividing by the particle form factor determined from dilute suspensions . </S>",
    "<S> an example of the angle - averaged structure factor is shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : sq ] , inset . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the first peak of the structure factor to elucidate changes in the nearest - neighbor structure upon yielding .    </S>",
    "<S> the applied shear introduces structural anisotropy : in an elastic material , shear leads to a well - known distortion of the structure resulting in an anisotropic intensity distribution along the first ring ; this is demonstrated by the angle - resolved structure factor at small strain amplitude in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sq ] ( red curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two - fold ( p - wave ) symmetry indicates a solid - like response ; it reflects the elastic response of the material to local shear distortions  @xcite , consistent with our direct imaging of the strain field by confocal microscopy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter reveals the ubiquity of quadrupolar elastic fields known as eshelby field  @xcite associated with elementary shear transformations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the normal strain component of this eshelby field has a @xmath27-wave symmetry in the shear plane , which is precisely the symmetry that we observe here . </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate the strain dependence of this anisotropy by following the structure factor as a function of increasing strain amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> while two - fold symmetry persists at small strain , at larger strain , this symmetry is lost and the structure factor becomes isotropic , as shown by the blue line for @xmath28 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sq ] .    to highlight this symmetry change most clearly , we determine the angular correlation function of the angle dependent structure factor @xmath29 , @xmath30 where we integrate over all angles @xmath31 as a function of the correlation angle @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we reduce possible effects of elliptical distortion of the first ring by averaging radially over an extended range of wave vectors ( @xmath33 ) around @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to follow the underlying symmetry most clearly . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate its strain evolution in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cor2d_vf30 ] inset , where we represent the angular correlation function with color and follow its evolution along the vertical axis . </S>",
    "<S> a sudden loss of symmetry is observed at @xmath35 , as demonstrated by the sudden disappearance of the p - wave pattern .    to investigate the sharpness of this transition </S>",
    "<S> , we define an order parameter that measures the degree of anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> a good choice of such order parameter is the peak value of the correlation function , @xmath36 , which is 1 for the ideal case of p - wave symmetry , and 0 for a complete loss of symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we show this order parameter as a function of @xmath14 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cor2d_vf30 ] ( blue line ) . at @xmath37 , an abrupt drop from @xmath38 to @xmath39 occurs , demonstrating a surprisingly sharp loss of orientational order and thus melting in the orientational degrees of freedom ; at the same time , the mean absolute value of @xmath40 does not change , indicating robust translational degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> a similar symmetry change was observed by us in the real - space imaging of a sheared colloidal glass  @xcite : the microscopic strain correlations changed symmetry from anisotropic solid to isotropic liquid - like . </S>",
    "<S> such symmetry change reminds of first order equilibrium transitions that demarcate qualitative changes of a material characterized by an order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter defined here together with the excellent time resolution allow us to indeed demonstrate the sharpness of this transition .    concomitantly with the loss of symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , the amplitude of fluctuations increases . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate these fluctuations by calculating their time correlation via @xmath41 where @xmath42 and we correlate order parameter values @xmath43 as a function of delay time @xmath44 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath45 is the averaging time interval . for sufficiently large @xmath45 , the time correlation should pick out the typical time scale of fluctuations , such as for example the underlying oscillation period , during which the colloidal glass may yield and reform @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our data does not show such characteristic time scale , possibly due to limited resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed independently by fourier analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we thus interpret these fluctuations as noise . to investigate their amplitude as a function of @xmath14 , we choose a short averaging period @xmath46s ; this allows us to clearly observe a sudden increase in the noise amplitude at @xmath37 as shown in fig  [ fig : cp2fluct_vf30 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate this sudden increase of amplitude by determining the kurtosis @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the kurtosis uses higher moments of intensity fluctuations to investigate the gaussian nature of fluctuations : a kurtosis value of 3 indicates a gaussian distribution and thus that fluctuations are uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> we determine instantaneous values of @xmath47 from spatial fluctuations of the structure factor along the diffraction ring using @xmath48 , where the @xmath49-th moment of the structure factor @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to follow the kurtosis as a function of applied strain . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting evolution of @xmath47 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cp2fluct_vf30 ] ( green curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> a sharp increase to a value of 3 occurs precisely at @xmath37 , indicating a sudden transition to gaussian fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of @xmath47 mirrors the evolution of the order parameter shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cor2d_vf30 ] ; hence , the loss of symmetry is accompanied by instantaneous changes to gaussian intensity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the disappearance of anisotropy , the increase of the amplitude of fluctuations and their transition to gaussian distributions suggest sudden melting of the glass in the orientational degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the value of strain @xmath37 is in reasonable agreement with the value 0.08 reported for the `` shear melting '' of colloidal glasses  @xcite ; the precise yield strain value , however , may depend weakly on the shear rate and the interactions of the particles .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus identify a sharp , dynamically induced transition in the glass structure . to link this microscopic transition to the rheological behavior of the glass , we follow the strain - dependant storage and loss moduli , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , simultaneously with the structure factor ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gprimes ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these moduli show the well - known strain dependence of dense suspensions : the plateau at small strain with @xmath53 is followed by the decrease of the moduli and their intersection , indicating the non - linear regime . </S>",
    "<S> the point where the two moduli cross is generally associated with the yield point  @xcite : the storage modulus decreases below the loss modulus indicating a gradual loss of elasticity . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the point where the two curves meet is close to @xmath37 , allowing us to associate the sharp structural transition with the rheological yielding of the material . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown most clearly in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cor2d_vf30 ] , where the moduli have been reproduced in enlarged form ( green and black lines ) ; the exact intersection of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , however , is hard to pinpoint and the curves even coexists for some range around @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , our structure factor analysis provides us with a much sharper definition of the yielding point ( @xmath37 ) , which makes the structural correlation analysis a powerful tool to pinpoint the yielding of the material . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that the moduli @xmath51 and @xmath52 as usual represent only the first harmonic response ; higher harmonics are missing in this representation , although they can be quite significant  @xcite , and their inclusion might provide a sharper mechanical signature of yielding .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( -225,10)(a )    ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( -225,10)(b )    further signature of yielding is observed in the position @xmath34 and width @xmath55 of the first peak as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : q1w1_vf30 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the initial solidity of the material reflects in the anisotropy of particle distances ; the decrease of @xmath34 along ( red curve ) , and its increase perpendicular to the shear direction ( blue curve ) indicates that particle separations increase along and decrease perpendicular to the applied shear , making them move past each more easily . the concomitant increase in the peak width ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : q1w1_vf30 ] , bottom ) indicates that this is accompanied by slight shear - induced disordering . </S>",
    "<S> this anisotropy increases until @xmath56 , where it suddenly disappears : the material can no longer sustain the anisotropic structure , and changes spontaneously into an isotropic fluid - like state . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the anisotropy shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : q1w1_vf30 ] appears as dip in the correlation function ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cor2d_vf30 ] ) and as peak in the kurtosis ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cp2fluct_vf30 ] ) ; this allows us to estimate the effect of ring distortions - both real and artificial - on the presented analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that while ring distortions have a visible effect , the observed sharp transition at @xmath37 can not be explained by these continuously evolving distortions and indicates a real structural transition of the glass . </S>",
    "<S> this abrupt transition , characterized by the order parameter @xmath36 , reminds of first - order transitions accompanying conventional solid - liquid phase changes . in the case </S>",
    "<S> presented here the transition is dynamically induced , triggered by the application of an external stress field to the glass . by combining oscillatory rheology and time - resolved x - ray scattering , we have identified a sharp structural transition at the yielding of a glass . </S>",
    "<S> the structural anisotropy characteristic of a solid vanishes abruptly , and isotropic gaussian fluctuations characteristic of a liquid appear , indicating a sharp dynamically induced transition from a solid to a liquid - like state . while the overall structural effect is small and difficult to detect by real - space techniques such as confocal microscopy , the large averaging power of x - ray scattering allows us to identify this transition clearly . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of angular correlation functions as order parameters allowed us to pinpoint the transition and demonstrate its sharpness . </S>",
    "<S> this transition , induced by application of an external shear field , thus looks akin to conventional first - order transitions . </S>"
