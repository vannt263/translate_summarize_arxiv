    "variations in the long - term spectral solar irradiance , i.e. the changes in the sun s brightness at a certain wavelength , are significant for their effects on earth s atmospheric temperature and composition .",
    "magnetic fields concentrated in small structures influence these long - term changes , with increasing relevance towards the solar limb . here",
    ", we compare observed and simulated intensity contrasts and investigate their behaviour from disk centre to the limb in 3d mhd simulations with different average vertical magnetic fields .",
    "in this work , we use 3d mhd simulations that have been run with non - grey radiative transfer using the muram code ( vgler et al . 2005 ) , which enables realistic simulations of solar magneto - convection in the photosphere and the upper layers of the convection zone .",
    "the simulations considered here had an average vertical field of 0 g , 50 g , 200 g .",
    "the simulations run on a 288 @xmath0 288 surface grid with 100 depth points , corresponding to a solar surface area of 6 @xmath0 6 mm and a depth of 1.4 mm .",
    "the intensities are calculated using the spectral synthesis code atlas9 ( kurucz 1993 ) on the simulated model atmospheres .",
    "we determine the root - mean - square ( rms ) contrast ( standard deviation divided by the mean value ) to characterise intensity variations between dark and bright features .",
    "the data used in this work were recorded with the broad - band filter imager mounted on the solar optical telescope ( sot , tsuneta et al .",

    "the pixel resolution is  0.05 arsec .",
    "the dark correction and flat fielding were done with ssw - idl routines .",
    "we have calculated intensity ( rms ) contrasts for the hinode images at different wavelengths ( 388 nm ( cn ) , 430.5 nm ( g - band ) , 450 nm ( blue continuum ) , 555 nm , 668 nm ) and compared them with contrasts for the muram / atlas images ( which were convolved with the corresponding psf ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the comparison of simulated ( original and convolved ) and observed images and their contrast histograms for the blue continuum , where we obtain an rms contrast of @xmath1% for the convolved muram simulation as well as for the hinode observations , while the rms contrast for the original simulation is @xmath2% .",

    "these changes become even stronger near the limb and are therefore crucial for spectral solar irradiance variations . in figure 2 , we study the simulated contrasts ( i.e. the mean intensity difference between the magnetic and quiet sun simulation compared to the quiet sun ) as a function of heliocentric position in five different wavelengths ( corresponding to the hinode / sot filters ) . we find that the contrast increases towards the limb and is higher for shorter wavelengths . for the simulation with the higher average vertical field of 200 g , the contrasts are significantly larger . the flattening and turnover",
