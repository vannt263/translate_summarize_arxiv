    "we start by an informal description of our purpose .",
    "random interlacements were introduced by sznitman in  @xcite , motivated by the problem of disconnection of the discrete torus @xmath3 by the trace of simple random walk , in dimension  @xmath4 or higher .",
    "detailed accounts can be found in the survey  @xcite and the recent book  @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , the model of random interlacements in  @xmath5 , @xmath6 , is a stationary poissonian soup of ( transient ) doubly infinite simple random walk trajectories on the integer lattice .",
    "there is an additional parameter  @xmath7 entering the intensity measure of the poisson process , the larger @xmath8  is the more trajectories are thrown in .",
    "the sites of  @xmath5 that are not touched by the trajectories constitute the _ vacant set _  @xmath9 .",
    "the random interlacements are constructed simultaneously for all @xmath7 in such a way that @xmath10 if @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , the law of the vacant set at level  @xmath8 can be uniquely characterized by the following identity : @xmath12 = \\exp\\big(-u { \\mathop{\\mathrm{cap}}}(a)\\big ) \\quad \\text{for all finite $ a\\subset{{\\mathbb z}}^d$},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the _ capacity _ of  @xmath14 .",
    "informally , the capacity measures how `` big '' the set is from the point of view of the walk , see section  6.5 of  @xcite for formal definitions , as well as   below .    at first glance",
    ", the title of this section seems to be meaningless , just because even a single trajectory of two - dimensional simple random walk a.s .",
    "visits all sites of  @xmath15 , so the vacant set would be always empty .",
    "nevertheless , there is also a natural notion of capacity in two dimensions ( cf .",
    "section  6.6 of  @xcite ) , so one may wonder if there is a way to construct a decreasing family @xmath16 of random subsets of  @xmath15 in such a way that a formula analogous to   holds for every finite  @xmath14 .",
    "this is , however , clearly not possible since the two - dimensional capacity of one - point sets equals  @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "it turns out to be possible to construct such a family so that @xmath18 = \\exp\\big(-\\pi\\alpha { \\mathop{\\mathrm{cap}}}(a)\\big)\\ ] ] holds _ for all sets containing the origin _",
    "( the factor  @xmath19 in the exponent is just for convenience , as explained below ) .",
    "we present this construction in section  [ s_results ] . to build the interlacements",
    ", we use trajectories of simple random walks conditioned on never hitting the origin .",
    "of course , the law of the vacant set is no longer translationally invariant , but we show that it has the property of _ conditional _ translation invariance , cf .  theorem  [ t_properties_ri ] below . in addition , we will see that ( similarly to the @xmath6 case ) the random object we construct has strong connections to random walks on two - dimensional torus .",
    "all this makes us believe that `` two - dimensional random interlacements '' is the right term for the object we introduce in this paper .",
    "consider the simple random walk on the two - dimensional discrete torus @xmath20 with the starting point chosen uniformly at random .",
    "let  @xmath21 be the first moment when this random walk visits all sites of  @xmath20 ; we refer to  @xmath21 as the _ cover time _ of the torus .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath22 in probability ; later , this result was refined in  @xcite , and then even finer results on the first correction to this limit were obtained in  @xcite for the similar problem of covering the ( continuous ) torus with a brownian sausage .    the structure of the set of _ late points _",
    "( i.e. , the set of points that are still unvisited up to a given time ) of the random walk on the torus is rather well understood in dimensions @xmath6 , see  @xcite , and also   @xcite for the continuous case . on the other hand ,",
    "much remains to be discovered in two dimensions .",
    "after the heuristic arguments of  @xcite revealing an intriguing random set , it was shown in  @xcite that this set has interesting fractal - like properties when the elapsed time is a fraction of the expected cover time .",
    "this particular behaviour is induced by long distance correlations between hitting times due to recurrence . in this paper , we prove that the law of the uncovered set around the origin at time @xmath23 _ conditioned _ on the event that the origin is uncovered , is close to the law of two - dimensional random interlacements at level  @xmath24 ( theorem  [ t_conditional ] ) .",
    "we hope that this result will lead to other advances in understanding the structure of the uncovered set .",
    "we now explain why conditioning is necessary to observe a meaningful point process . in two dimensions ,",
    "if we know that simple random walk has visited a given site by a large time , then it is likely , by recurrence , that it has has visited all the nearby sites as well .",
    "this means that a fixed - size window around the origin will be typically either full ( on the event that the origin was visited ) or empty ( if the origin was not yet visited ) .",
    "therefore , we need to condition on a rare event to obtain a nontrivial limit .    as a side note ,",
    "observe that the two - dimensional random interlacements relate to the simple random walk on the torus at a time proportional to the cover time . in higher dimensions ,",
    "one starts to observe the `` interlacement regime '' already at times below the cover time by a factor of  @xmath25 .",
    "* organisation of the paper * : in section  [ s_results ] we construct the model of random interlacements and present some of its properties . in section  [ s_rw_interl ]",
    "we formulate a result relating this model and the vacant set of the simple random walk on the discrete torus .",
    "we prove some results on the spot  when short arguments are available  postponing the proof of the other ones to section  [ s_proofs ] .",
    "section  [ s_aux ] contains a number of auxiliary facts needed for the proof of the main results .",
    "we start by defining the two - dimensional random interlacement process , which involves some potential - theoretic considerations .",

    "also , the function  @xmath44 is harmonic outside the origin , i.e. , @xmath53 observe that   immediately implies that @xmath54 is a martingale , we will repeatedly use this fact in the sequel . with some abuse of notation",
    ", we also consider the function @xmath55 of a _ real _ argument  @xmath56 .",
    "the advantage of using this notation is e.g.  that , due to  , we may write , as @xmath57 , @xmath58 for _ any _ probability measure  @xmath59 on @xmath60 .",

    "] ] intuitively , means that the harmonic measure at @xmath63 is proportional to the probability of escaping from  @xmath28 to a large sphere .",
    "observe also that , by recurrence of the walk , @xmath64 is a probability measure on  @xmath65 .",
    "now , for a finite set  @xmath14 containing the origin , we define its capacity by @xmath66 in particular , @xmath67 since @xmath46 . for a set not containing the origin ,",
    "its capacity is defined as the capacity of a translate of this set that does contain the origin .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that the capacity does not depend on the choice of the translation .",
    "a number of alternative definitions are available , cf .",
    "section  6.6 of  @xcite . intuitively ,",
    "the capacity of @xmath14 represents the difference in size between the set @xmath14 and a single point , as seen from infinity : from ( 6.40 ) and the formula above proposition 6.6.2 in  @xcite , we can write @xmath68   = \\frac { \\ln \\|x\\| + \\frac{\\pi \\gamma'}{2 } - \\frac{\\pi}{2 } { \\mathop{\\mathrm{cap}}}(a )    + { \\varepsilon}_a(x ) + { \\varepsilon}_{a , x}'(r)}{\\ln r},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 vanishes as @xmath70 and @xmath71 vanishes as @xmath72 keeping fixed the other variables . observe that , by symmetry , the harmonic measure of any two - point set is uniform , so @xmath73 for any @xmath74 .",
    "also , implies that @xmath75    let us define another random walk @xmath76 on  @xmath15 ( in fact , on  @xmath77 ) in the following way : the transition probability from  @xmath28 to  @xmath32 equals @xmath78 for all @xmath31 ( this definition does not make sense for @xmath79 , but this is not a problem since the walk  @xmath80 can never enter the origin anyway )",
    ". the walk  @xmath80 can be thought of as the doob @xmath0-transform of the simple random walk , under condition of not hitting the origin ( see lemma  [ l_relation_s_hats ] and its proof ) .",
    "note that   implies that the random walk  @xmath80 is indeed well defined , and , clearly , it is an irreducible markov chain on  @xmath77 .",
    "we denote by @xmath81 the probability and expectation for the random walk  @xmath80 started from  @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath83 be defined as in  , but with  @xmath80 in the place of  @xmath39 .",
    "then , it is straightforward to observe that    * the walk  @xmath80 is reversible , with the reversible measure  @xmath84 ; * in fact , it can be represented as a random walk on the two - dimensional lattice with conductances ( or weights ) @xmath85 ; * @xmath86 is an excessive measure for  @xmath80 ( i.e. , for all @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) , with equality failing at the four neighbours of the origin . therefore , by e.g. theorem  1.9 of chapter  3 of  @xcite , the random walk  @xmath80 is transient ; * an alternative argument for proving transience is the following : let  @xmath89 be the set of the four neighbours of the origin .",
    "then , a direct calculation shows that @xmath90 is a martingale .",
    "the transience then follows from theorem  2.2.2 of  @xcite .",

    "now , we use the general construction of random interlacements on a transient weighted graph introduced in  @xcite . in the following few lines we briefly summarize this construction .",
    "let  @xmath96 be the space of all doubly infinite nearest - neighbour transient trajectories in  @xmath15 , @xmath97 we say that  @xmath98 and  @xmath99 are equivalent if they coincide after a time shift , i.e. , @xmath100 when there exists  @xmath101 such that @xmath102 for all  @xmath103 .",
    "then , let @xmath104 be the space of trajectories modulo time shift , and define  @xmath105 to be the canonical projection from  @xmath96 to  @xmath106 . for a finite @xmath91 ,",
    "let  @xmath107 be the set of trajectories in  @xmath96 that intersect  @xmath14 , and we write  @xmath108 for the image of  @xmath107 under  @xmath105 .",
    "one then constructs the random interlacements as poisson point process on @xmath109 with the intensity measure @xmath110 , where  @xmath59 is described in the following way .",
    "it is the unique sigma - finite measure on the cylindrical sigma - field of  @xmath106 such that for every finite  @xmath14 @xmath111 where the finite measure  @xmath112 on  @xmath107 is determined by the following equality : @xmath113 =   \\widehat e_a(x ) \\cdot { \\widehat{p}}_x[f ] \\cdot { \\widehat{p}}_x[g\\mid { \\widehat{\\tau}}_1(a)\\!=\\!\\infty].\\ ] ] the existence and uniqueness of  @xmath59 was shown in theorem  2.1 of  @xcite .",
    "[ def : ri ] for a configuration @xmath114 of the above poisson process , the process of random interlacements at level  @xmath24 ( which will be referred to as ri(@xmath24 ) ) is defined as the set of trajectories with label less than or equal to  @xmath115 , i.e. , @xmath116    observe that this definition is somewhat unconventional ( we used  @xmath115 instead of just  @xmath24 , as one would normally do ) , but we will see below that it is quite reasonable in two dimensions , since the formulas become generally cleaner .",
    "it is important to have in mind the following `` constructive '' description of random interlacements at level  @xmath24 `` observed '' on a finite set @xmath91 .",
    "namely ,    * take a poisson(@xmath117 ) number of particles ; * place these particles on the boundary of  @xmath14 independently , with distribution @xmath118 ; * let the particles perform independent @xmath80-random walks ( since  @xmath80 is transient , each walk only leaves a finite trace on  @xmath14 ) .    it is also worth mentioning that the fkg inequality holds for random interlacements , cf .  theorem  3.1 of  @xcite .",

    "the only vacant site is the origin .",
