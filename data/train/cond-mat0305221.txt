    "in the preceding paper,@xcite we have developed the dynamical theory for x - ray resonant magnetic specular reflectivity using the self - consistent method in the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "it is important to bear in mind , however , that specular reflectivity , which measures the density profile normal to the surface averaged over the in - plane directions , can yield only information corresponding to the root - mean - square roughness ( or equivalently , the average width ) of the interfaces .",
    "a more complete description of the morphology of the roughness can only be obtained from off - specular or diffuse scattering studies .",
    "the first such studies of resonant x - ray magnetic diffuse scattering studies were carried out recently by mackay @xmath0 @xmath1.@xcite from these measurements , quantities , such as the in - plane correlation length of the roughness , the interlayer roughness correlations and the roughness exponent , can be deduced .",
    "these quantities are of considerable importance . in the case of magnetic films ,",
    "freeland @xmath0 @xmath1.@xcite found little correlation of the variations in the magnetic coercive force @xmath2 for a variety of samples with the average roughness ( chemical or magnetic ) but a systematic dependence on the roughness correlation length . in the case of giant magnetoresistance ( gmr )",
    "films , contradictory results have been found in studying how the magnitude of the gmr effect depended on the chemical roughness alone , and it is likely that the effect depends on a more detailed set of parameters related to the magnetic ( as well as possibly the chemical ) roughness.@xcite barna and palasantzas@xcite have carried out calculations of the manner in which self - affine roughness at an interface affects electronic transport .",
    "methods were developed earlier to calculate analytically the offspecular components of the charge scattering of x - rays by rough surfaces and interfaces using the born approximation ( ba ) and the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba).@xcite we present here the generalization of these methods to the case of resonant magnetic x - ray scattering from surfaces or interfaces of ferromagnetic materials possessing both structural and magnetic roughness .",
    "for this purpose , in the preceding paper@xcite we have represented the deviations from a smooth magnetic interface in terms of a `` rough '' magnetic interface , distinct from the structural interface ( but possibly correlated strongly with it ) , with its own self - affine roughness parameters and parameters representing the correlation of the structural with the magnetic roughness height fluctuations .",
    "components of the magnetization at the interface , which are disordered on much shorter length scales , are ignored in this treatment , as they will scatter at much lager @xmath3-values than those of interest here .",
    "the ba results have been previously presented in an earlier publication@xcite and already applied in interpreting x - ray resonant magnetic diffuse scattering measurements from magnetic multilayers.@xcite we also note that the analogous case of off - specular neutron scattering by magnetic roughness was treated earlier by sinha@xcite and more recent treatment has been given by toperverg.@xcite    the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> the theoretical formulation of x - ray resonant magnetic scattering from rough surfaces and interfaces is given for the diffuse ( off - specular ) scattering , and general expressions are derived in both the born approximation ( ba ) and the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) for both single and multiple interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we also give in the ba the expression for off - specular magnetic scattering from magnetic domains . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , structural and magnetic interfaces are defined in terms of roughness parameters related to their height - height correlation functions and the correlations between them . </S>",
    "<S> the results are generalized to the case of multiple interfaces , as in the case of thin films or multilayers . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical calculations for each of the cases are illustrated as numerical examples and compared with experimental data of mangetic diffuse scattering from a gd / fe multilayer . </S>"
