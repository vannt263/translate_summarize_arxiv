    "interaction of @xmath0 mesons with other hadrons including nucleons and nuclei is not yet well understood .",
    "being a member of the @xmath17 octet of pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath0 has a spatial structure similar to that of the pion .",
    "however , @xmath0 has isospin 0 and contains about 50% of strange quarks ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "it is much heavier than the pion ( 547 mev versus 140 mev ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 ( and especially @xmath19 ) is strongly mixed with gluons which contribute through the @xmath20 anomaly and make @xmath19 heavier than @xmath0",
    ". for all these reasons , chiral symmetry which underlies pion dynamics at low energies put far less constraints onto the low - energy dynamics of @xmath0 .    nowadays",
    ", it is generally assumed that @xmath21 interaction at low energies is dominated by production and decay of the intermediate @xmath6 resonance ( @xmath22 ) which overlaps @xmath21 threshold ( @xmath23 mev ) within the total width of the resonance , @xmath24 \\simeq 150 $ ] mev .",
    "most of experimental information on the @xmath21 interaction comes from studies of the reactions @xmath25 and @xmath26 followed by their comparison with similar processes , in which @xmath0 is replaced by the pion ( i.e.  @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "such a comparison is not straightforward and subject to model uncertainties .    assuming the @xmath6 dominance , the @xmath29-wave breit - wigner cross sections of the above reactions are proportional to partial widths of the @xmath6 resonance : @xmath30 from the first two channels , the @xmath31- and @xmath0-widths and couplings of @xmath6 can be found .",
    "furthermore , the cross section of @xmath21 scattering can be derived too via @xmath32 following this line in a modified form ( in the framework of the couple - channel formalism ) , bhalerao and liu @xcite estimated the @xmath21 scattering amplitude and found , in particular , the @xmath21 scattering length @xmath33 using the third channel in ( [ channels ] ) , the radiative width of @xmath6 can also be determined .",
    "a result obtained by the vpi - gwu group @xcite and based on their partial - wave analysis of pion photoproduction ( said ) reads @xmath34 ( for the proton target ) and @xmath35 ( for the neutron one ) in terms of the photocouplings @xmath36 .",
    "alternatively , the same radiative widths and photocouplings can be determined from the fourth channel in ( [ channels ] ) .",
    "using mainz data on @xmath0 photoproduction off protons and deuterons , the result was obtained @xcite which was dramatically different from the previous findings : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the radiative decay width of @xmath39 , being determined through @xmath31-photoproduction , is by the factor of @xmath40 less than the one determined through @xmath0-photoproduction .",
    "this difference is even larger in the case of @xmath41 .",
    "such a large discrepancy implies that the factorization of the cross sections can not be valid and therefore large nonresonance backgrounds persist in some , if not all , considered channels . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a dynamical model was developed , in which nonresonance backgrounds were explicitly evaluated and indeed found to be very essential and large .",
    "it is often claimed that the radiative widths of @xmath6 must be determined through @xmath0 photoproduction , where the background is allegedly small , and must not be determined through @xmath31 one , where the background may be larger due to influence of a few overlapping resonances .",
    "in particular , in a recent update of the said analysis of pion photoproduction @xcite the photocouplings of the @xmath6 resonance are announced to be  too uncertain to be quoted  .",
    "even so , our knowledge of @xmath21 couplings and interactions crucially depends on the factorization and extrapolation which leads us from experimentally investigated channels ( [ channels ] ) to the unknown one , @xmath21 scattering ( [ eta - channel ] ) .    in modern phenomenological analyses specific assumptions made on resonances and backgrounds",
    "are different from those assumed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , more high - lying resonances are included , what is effectively equivalent to considering the background in the older approach energy dependent .",
    "these changes , being physically marginal , have however a great impact on the derived @xmath21 scattering amplitude . for example , the @xmath21 scattering length found in recent works through a coupled - channel analysis of the first two reactions in ( [ channels ] ) reads @xmath42 note a dramatic difference in the real part of @xmath43 .    with more channels included and with the background structure more complicated , the result for",
    "@xmath43 may change again .",
    "currently , phenomenological analyses ignore channels involving strange particles ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 )  simply because of the lack of experimental data in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "meanwhile it was theoretically shown @xcite that an interplay of strange channels with nonstrange ones can generate an energy - dependent structure in @xmath12 and @xmath21 reactions which is very similar to that usually associated with the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "thus , even the very dominance in the above reactions of the fundamental three - quark state , the @xmath6 resonance , over the dynamically generated coupled - channels peaks ( hadron molecules ) becomes questionable .    in order to bring new experimental constraints , to check the factorization , to test a truncated coupled - channel dynamics , and at the end to arrive at a more reliable knowledge of properties of the @xmath6 resonance , direct data on @xmath21 interaction",
    "are badly needed .",
    "they can , in principle , be obtained through studies of @xmath0 in the final states of nuclear reactions .",
    "this naturally suggests a need for 1 ) investigations of the energy region near but above @xmath21 threshold , where @xmath21 scattering affects cross sections through the final - state interaction , and 2 ) investigations of the subthreshold energy region , where formation of bound states of @xmath0 and a nucleus is possible .",
    "experimental studies of bound states of various @xmath48 systems would greatly contribute to learning elementary @xmath21 scattering and , more generally , to understanding of meson - baryon interactions in the second nucleon - resonance region .",
    "scattering amplitude @xmath49 ( in units of fm ) @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      eta - mesic nuclei ( @xmath50 ) are a new kind of short - living nuclei which consist of ordinary particles , i.e.  nucleons , and a lighter one , the @xmath0-meson , which is bound by nuclear forces with the nucleons .",
    "the @xmath0-nuclei have many resemblances with better - studied @xmath51- and @xmath52-hypernuclei which consist of nucleons and @xmath51 or @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "a big difference is , however , in the life - time , because @xmath0-nuclei decay via strong rather than weak interaction .",
    "a typical width of bound-@xmath0 levels in nuclei is of order @xmath53 mev @xcite or even @xmath54 mev @xcite .",
    "annihilation of the bound @xmath0-meson through the reaction @xmath55 in the nuclear matter dominates this width . about @xmath56% of the width",
    "is caused by the collisional process @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "a tiny fraction of @xmath0-decays inside the nucleus ( of order @xmath58 ) happens due to the two - photon decay @xmath5 too .",
    "due to virtual transitions between @xmath21 states and the @xmath6 resonance , part of time the @xmath0-nucleus is seen as a complex of @xmath6 and @xmath59 nucleons .",
    "the very existence of the bound @xmath0-a states @xcite is possible because the positive real part of @xmath43 results in an average attraction between a slow @xmath0 and a nuclear matter .",
    "this attraction is ( roughly ) characterized by the first - order optical potential @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the nuclear density . depending on the magnitude of the scattering length @xmath43 ,",
    "such an attraction is sufficient for binding @xmath0 in all nuclei of sufficient size  namely those with @xmath62 , if eq .",
    "( [ a - old ] ) is used , or even those with @xmath63 , if newer values of @xmath43 , eq .",
    "( [ a - new ] ) , are valid",
    ". with slightly larger @xmath43 , @xmath0-bound states are possible for @xmath64 and @xmath65 too @xcite .",
    "when the kinetic energy of @xmath0 is not zero , the optical potential becomes proportional to the @xmath21 scattering amplitude @xmath49 .",
    "the real part of @xmath49 , the threshold value of which is just equal to the scattering length @xmath43 , is expected to remain positive up to kinetic energies of @xmath0 below 70 mev ( see fig .",
    "[ f - etan ] ) .",
    "this means that the effective @xmath48 attraction probably exists in a wide near - threshold energy region , @xmath66  mev .",
    "the attractive forces in the final state must lead to a near - threshold enhancement in the total and differential cross section of real-@xmath0 production by different beams . such an enhancement was indeed observed in several reactions including @xmath67 @xcite , @xmath68 @xcite and @xmath69 @xcite , thus supporting the existence of a rather strong @xmath70 attraction even for the lightest nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , all these experiments , which have deal with @xmath0 in the final state , can not directly prove that bound @xmath71 states do really exist .",
    "a well - known counter - example is provided by the @xmath13 system in the @xmath72 state , which has a virtual rather than real level described by a _",
    "negative _ rather than positive scattering length .",
    "therefore , direct observations of bound states through studies of the subthreshold energy region are certainly needed in order to fully reconstruct the @xmath48 optical potential and the elementary @xmath21 scattering amplitude . at energies above the threshold ,",
    "studies of real-@xmath0 production on nuclei with different @xmath3 are needed in order to investigate the optical potential at different nuclear densities .",
    "generally , experimental studies of various @xmath48 systems in the discrete and continuous spectrum would greatly contribute to understanding of meson - baryon interactions in the second nucleon - resonance region .",
    "two attempts to discover @xmath0-nuclei in the missing mass spectrum of the reaction @xmath73 were performed at brookhaven @xcite and los alamos @xcite soon after the first theoretical suggestions @xcite .",
    "it was then expected that a capture of a produced slow @xmath0 to a bound level(s ) would result in a peak(s ) of the width @xmath74 mev near the end of the kinetic energy spectrum of the knocked - out forward - flying protons .",
    "however , narrow peaks were found neither in @xcite , nor in @xcite .",
    "an explanation was soon suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the imaginary part of the optical @xmath48 potential @xmath75 was argued to get a great increase owing to the two - pion absorption of @xmath0 via the reaction @xmath76 .",
    "accordingly , a great increase in the widths of bound-@xmath0 levels was predicted too .",
    "the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite was that the bound-@xmath0 levels in nuclei may be so wide that they strongly overlap and hence a broad bump arises instead of a set of narrow lines in the spectrum .",
    "this was exactly what the experiment @xcite showed , in which a broad bump of the width @xmath77 mev was observed approximately at the place where narrow peaks were earlier predicted @xcite",
    ".    there is , however , a flaw in the above explanation , because a large increase in im@xmath75 is obtained in @xcite only with the mass , the width and the couplings of @xmath6 which do not accurately reproduce available experimental data on the reaction @xmath78 .",
    "when these parameters are changed in order to fit the data , the dramatic increase of the widths completely disappears ( see the second columns in the table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in a more recent work @xcite",
    ", the absence of huge medium effects on the imaginary part of the optical potential @xmath75 was re - established and a physical picture with relatively narrow levels was confirmed .",
    "very recent calculations @xcite agree with these findings .    still , there is another physical reason for unresolving narrow lines .",
    "the point is that the @xmath0-mesic nucleus can be produced with excited nucleon degrees of freedom . that is , the energy of the nuclear core which binds @xmath0 is not fixed but rather smeared over the fermi sea",
    ". such a fermi smearing also contributes to broadening peaks in the observed spectra and makes it more difficult to disentangle them from a smooth background .",
    "the conclusion is that the negative results @xcite of a search for @xmath0-mesic nuclei in the previous missing - mass experiments do not necessary mean that such physical objects either do not exist or dissolve in the continuum .",
    "rather the inclusive method of @xcite was less reliable for searching for broad peaks and hence for measuring energy levels of @xmath0-mesic nuclei than it was then assumed .",
    "recently , the first positive signal for @xmath0-mesic nuclei was observed in a photoreaction @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the inclusive experiments @xcite , decay products of @xmath0-mesic nuclei have been detected in that work .",

    "moreover , owing to a limited energy resolution of photon detectors , the @xmath96 events from the bound-@xmath0 decays can be lost on the background of @xmath96 pairs arising after photoproduction of slow @xmath0-mesons without a formation of the @xmath0-nucleus , what exactly happens at energies slightly above threshold .",
